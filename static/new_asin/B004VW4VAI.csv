4484674,5,B004VW4VAI,"These were the favourite cartoons for both my sons many years ago, and Saturday mornings were wonderfully peaceful once they came on the TV. Both are now in their 40's with children of their own and that is why I bought the cartoons. My grandchildren are just as keen on them as their fathers were. Thank you for the memories. The product was well packaged, delivered in a timely fashion and arrived sooner than expected. Many many thanks. Carmel Smith.",1339286400,3,453,4.675
4484675,5,B004VW4VAI,"I bought this at a retail outlet for my brother-in-law. He really likes this. It was cheaper there, but this price is good, too, if I were to have purchased it now.",1332892800,3,164,4.15625
4484676,3,B004VW4VAI,"I remembered watching this as a child and I love animated shows and movies. I am a kid at heart but I really could not handle this one. I love Halloween and I thought this would be a good one to watch with my one year old but nah!
I could only stand to watch about 10 minutes of it. It was kinda annoying. I love monsters and stuff so I thought I would love it. I mean it's okay but I only give it a three star!!!",1326412800,3,413,3.7045454545454546
4484677,5,B004VW4VAI,"I saw that the complete Groovie Goolies series came out on DVD a few years ago, but I felt like the price was too high. So a few days ago, while poking around Amazon, I was delighted to discover that this very inexpensive Groovie Goolies sampler was just released! I received it today, and it's PERFECT. Six episodes chock full of images and sounds I remember from 35 years ago! The color is amazing, and the images look sharp on my set. Several of the episodes, for some reason, have no laugh or applause tracks, but thankfully, two of them do, since that was part of my childhood viewing experience. I will say, those shows without the laugh tracks, allow me to hear for the first time, very clearly, that great, repetitive Groovie Goolies background music! Memorable ""guest bands"" like The Mummies and The Puppies are here, and plenty of those Scooby Doo-style musical interludes. Also fun to see in the closing credits ""Horta-Mahana Sound Effects"" and ""Filmation, A TelePrompTer Company"". Get this for your collection, and like Frankie, you'll be saying, ""I needed that!"" - William",1313452800,18,1085,4.807486631016043
4484678,5,B004VW4VAI,"Growing up in NYC, Saturday Morning Cartoons in the 60's and 70's, were a staple. These characters started off in a cartoon called Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies. This collecton, is part of  the later shows which featured  the Goolies as  the main characters. I hope kids of today can see these and enjoy them. I know I have the recent  BCI release of the entire series from some years back and will still buy this one. I just hope one day they'll release the original Goolies with Sabrina, as the theme music used on that one was slightly different and they even had a live-action cartoon, where the Goolies come out of the cartoon and become real live beings. In the meantime, break out the Alpha Bits, Cap'n Crunch, the Goolies are  back on the air.. Thanks, I needed That as Frankie used to say..:)",1306713600,24,803,4.472602739726027
4484679,2,B004VW4VAI,"I loved this cartoon as a child and was extremely excited to see that it was now on DVD. Unfortunately I didn't realize the content was shallow, silly and bad jokes  repeated over and over.

4484684,2,B004VW4VAI,"Okay, once again, the only reviews that these early period Saturday morning shows receive are from my own dated generation, who keep dating themselves by the minute by not removing those rose-colored glasses of theirs. However, in order to keep it realistic, I felt it was time to chime in. First of all, I was one of the #1 Goolies fans, literally. I LOVED these guys. I loved everything Universal monsters, though, as well. However, I was also in kindergarten at the time the show was broadcast. Secondly, what I'd forgotten was just how stale of a show it had been. The ""puns"", if you can honestly compliment them enough to even call them this, are some of the most awful I've ever heard. In reviewing pretty much all of the original Saturday morning venue from between 1964-1974, I have to sadly admit that some of my original favorites of the period - the Filmation ""Archie shows"" (""The Archie Show"" and it's reformatted followups, 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch"", and this one) - are some of the worst of the bunch. Sad days are these. I loved the old 50s-60s Archie comics, as well.",1436140800,2,1085,4.626943005181347

4484686,5,B004VW4VAI,"Again this is one of my cartoon series, love this cartoon because it is silly. The Goolies are funny and pointate ..I am trying to collect all of the cartoons from my childhood. It is so weird that there are no cartoons on anymore, even Cartoon Network and Boomerang don't show most of the good ones, so I am doing it for me",1428105600,5,324,4.158730158730159

4484688,3,B004VW4VAI,"This DVD is just LAUGH IN Groovie Goolies style. I was expecting adventures since the Groovie Goolies are an off shoot of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH, but I was disappointed.  It was just silly one-liner puns throughout each episode. I remember seeing the Groovie Goolies on SABRINA once and thought they were quite funny.  I don't remember them having their own TV show.
The puns were in the style of old vaudeville, but worse. I had to turn the off after the third episode. I just couldn't stand their one-liner puns. This DVD is somewhat rare and I can understand why, it is just not funny.",1423872000,2,591,4.566037735849057
