8209535,3,B000TJ0S7C,"Definitely worth watching once, this film actually could have been really, really good, I think. The premise - wonderful. The acting... meh. The cast/setting - superb. If you ignore that the acting isn't so great and think about what the filmmaker was going for - there was A LOT of potential in this film. A nice effort.",1453334400,,321,4.649122807017544
8209536,5,B000TJ0S7C,"My first review has disappeared... what happened to it?

This was a stunning film. I am just speechless.

I will wait and hope the first one shows up. In the meantime, read more about Damian K. Lahey, who wrote, acted in the lead role and co-directed this phenomenal film, at IndieSlate dot com, ""Sophmore Blues.""

8209537,4,B000TJ0S7C,"This film portrays in great detail the meager existence of advanced drug abusers just before jail, overdose, or rehab.  I would imagine you could find an identical clone of any one of these characters on any random day in a 72 hour detox.  It also does a better job than similar films of shining a spotlight on just how much time and energy is expended on their desperate con games for getting some kind of fix.",1350259200,2,411,4.394736842105263
8209538,4,B000TJ0S7C,Perhaps I'm partial to this movie since I live in Jacksonville and know a lot of the area shown in the movie. I was moved by the story. Stunningly Haunting.,1299974400,2,156,4.233333333333333
8209539,2,B000TJ0S7C,"Oy, this one is a downer. The lead does a great job, but it's just a wandering drug flick.",1200873600,,90,3.789473684210526
8209540,5,B000TJ0S7C,"I rented this on Netflix, having been intrigued by the title, and wound up actually buying it.  This is not a pretty film.  It's rough around the edges, with a hard, real, low-budget look to it, but it's one of the strongest, best-written, and most realistic slices of life on the edge that I have ever seen.  The performances, particularly by Damian Lahey as the cokehead barely keeping it together, are uniformly raw and emotionally naked, without ever being over-the-top, stereotypical, or forced.  Studio productions could learn a big lesson in basic story-telling and character portrayal from this one.",1194825600,6,607,5.101010101010101
