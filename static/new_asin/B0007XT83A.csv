8053614,5,B0007XT83A,"This well produced program intercuts a long interview with Phil with video of the 2004 small band recording session for ""This is How I Feel About Quincy,"" which honors the fine Quincy Jones Big Band of the late '50s and early '60s. Gene Quill, Cannonball Adderley, and Woods were the hot new alto players on the scene in those days, and Phil's fiery alto solos did much to define the sound of what was an all-star band.

This is really a portrait of Phil, who, when it was recorded, was still in his prime. The pleasures are in the interview and in his playing during that session. Sound and video are uniformly excellent.  The main program runs 64 minutes, and there's an additional 24 minutes of out-takes from the interview. Both the music and the interviews are thoroughly enjoyable, and the programmatic flow is excellent. I loved it!",1481673600,,839,4.662162162162162
8053615,3,B0007XT83A,"I collect DVD s of my idols in music. I enjoy interviews and the history that many of these artists offer in the documentary parts of these offerings. However, I buy them so that I can also hear them play. After all, that's what they are known for. I have a pretty large collection and this one by far has the least playing and the most talking that I own. The crew is in the studio and they start playing, you think, wow! this is good stuff, and then suddenly all you see and hear is someone talking. So this a DVD that I will not be pulling out and playing so that I can hear their work.
I looked and could not find a DVD that was strictly performance for Phil Woods. Anybody know of one?",1442188800,2,690,4.043795620437956
8053616,5,B0007XT83A,"Phil Woods is arguably the greatest living jazz giant/legend (who's left?).  Of course, Sonny Rollins is also the greatest--and there are those who would insist on including Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor (who would have imagined their staying power upon first hearing this controversial pair in the fifties?). Suddenly, other candidates for ""greatest living"" come to mind: Dave Brubeck (don't underestimate him--especially his work with Paul BEFORE ""Time Out""); Ahmad Jamal (Miles set us all straight about his musicianship and importance); the indestructible Roy Haynes (and don't forget Louis Hayes); Gary Burton (no longer merely a ""pedagogue""); Herbie and Chick (can they really be 70?  and Keith, as well? - I confess Bill Evans' playing, early and late, still occupies much more of my time than all three).  I guess there are others--Lee Konitz (who sounded like he was still on his game when I caught him with Bill Frisell just several years ago), Jack Sheldon (one of the most personal, warm, identifiable ""trumpet voices"" in addition to his singing voice (admittedly, the latter is an acquired taste but worth the effort); Bob Dorough (O.K., I'll admit he's not on the same level.  But I was overjoyed to discover him in NYC in tthe '90s after wearing out his Bethlehem mid-'50s LP: ""Devil May Care"").  I'll leave it there--maybe a reader can add some others in the comments.)

Out of the whole group Phil is closest to playing with the technical brilliance he displayed way back in the '50s, shortly after Bird's death, on recordings with Gene Quill or just a rhythm section.  Sonny Rollins is always a bigger-than-life ""act""--the avatar of the jazz tradition'--but he's not even close to the Rollins of the '50s Verve albums with Diz and Stitt or with Miles (Prestige) and Max and Clifford (Emarcy). Phil can still put away the pretenders, much as he did back in the day:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Altos/dp/B000000Z5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Altos</a>

""Life in E Flat"" may not hold the attention of those who are unfamiliar with Phil.  It's a straightforward, ""honest"" (no excessive editing or fancy camera work), and satisfying portrait of the man and the musician.  We hear his distinctive sound (none fuller--how I wish he'd recorded with Stitt or Cannonball!) and formidable technique.  Suddenly the unimposing, rather short and stout ""man with the hat"" becomes an affable, real (and surprisingly ""ordinary""--in a good sense) person.  The audio gets as miuch attention as the visuals, making for a DVD that has believability and amiable ""presence"" throughout.

Phil is a good story-teller, and the viewer can interpret his recollections of Quincy as he chooses. He dwells on ""Q"" (the subject of the album we see being recorded), and on Dizzy, Blakey, and Mingus (upon walking into a club and dissing Phil for ""presuming"" to play Charlie Parker's King alto, Mingus provoked not humility, embarrassment, intimidation in Phil--but anger!  ""I was working my tail off to feed Bird's kids!  I wanted to slap him in the face!""

Phil has always carried his share of ""mystery""--the man who inherited Bird's horn and became the supportive companion of Bird's wife; the supreme alto player who somehow never had the ""impact"" of some of his contemporaries--Cannonball (an undeniable force, the earthy and ""preaching"" counterpart to the ever-searching, upward-bound, Promethean Coltrane), Stitt (the most prolific and consistent melodist of all, his LPs scattered on all 4 floors of  my house), Pepper (a magnet to listeners even in Japan, leaving behind a generous discography despite 2 lengthy prison terms); Ornette, Desmond, even Jackie McClean (another presumptive heir of Bird's mantle, who once ""bragged"" that he refused to attend Charlie Parker's funeral because of Bird's self-immolation) kept putting out discs on Blue Note.  Phil at times seemed comparatively invisible, especially in the ""musically unfriendly"" '60s and '70s, except to listeners who recognized the alto player on ""Just the Way You Are.""  He talks about art vs. the ""business"" of music, balancing innovation with making a few bucks, and he lingers a bit on ""family,"" which extends to the numerous musicians he's worked with.

It occurs to me that therein lies a potential ""key"" to this superb musician's, at times, cloudy life-path.  Curiously, he says nothing about the tragic end of fellow altoist and recording partner, Gene Quill, or the effect of Quill's deterioration (and destitution) on him personally. Phil simply chose to ""clean up his act"" early on (with the help of--if you choose to believe him--Dizzy and Blakey!).  And he chose to stay in ""safe,"" friendly company, sticking with the guys who were family.  That's fully understandable to any one of us, and it makes all the more credible Phil's claim that, like Benny Carter, he'll play til he's 95.  Still, I'm left to wonder--what if Phil had toured with Miles, or had become a lone-wolf troubador traveling the planet like Stitt, or made a few of those heated sessions when jazz producer  Joe Segal would bring 2-4 tough tenors (and occasionally alto players) to Chicago's Jazz Showcase.  Imagine sticking your neck out and mixing it up with ""strange"" but hard-driving, relentlessly swinging rhythm sections along with a few of the outrageously talented players who thrived on jam sessions, providing they were also ""cutting contests"" for the big boys.  Stitt, Cannon, and Phil on the same bandstand, with a rhythm section like Oscar's--what a dream come true that would have been.

But the jazz life can take a toll--and too soon it's over.  ""Down Beat"" magazine reported--sometime in the '90s--that the average life-span of a jazz musician was 43 years--one of the reasons Segal sent shock waves throughout the greater Chicago jazz community when he banned smoking--in a jazz club!--way back in the '90s.  Thankfully, Phil is still with us, and he's consistently on top of the music--and without avant garde poses or pretentious bluff or meaningless innovation just to be ""different.""  I've caught him live at least 3 times, and he played beautifully each time (on one occasion quickly outshining Frank Morgan).  But I never found my foot tapping, my head bobbing, my body moving with unselfconscious joy--at least not on the occasions when Phil played with his long-time, traveling, always dependable ""house rhythm section"" (though Charlap is always a special pleasure).

In other words, there's swing--and then there's SWING!  The first is safe, predictable, genteel.  The second is a magical chemistry between great musicians (often playing together for the first time) and the opportune moment--and when it happens, both you and the beaming, smiling musicians know it.  Like the Mahareshi, you and the whole room ""levitate,"" and life is as good as it gets--if only for that instant, which thereafter becomes a ""spot of time,"" lodged in personal memory but rising to primary consciousness on the (increasingly) rare occasions when you encounter the possibility of that moment's recurrence.  Sometimes a drummer or bassist can make the difference; other times, it's a horn player (I've seen Lockjaw Davis, a one-man swing machine, pick up a whole band with his Selmer Mark VI).  Admittedly, it involves taking on risks and going to trouble and bother that are usually disproportionate with any monetary reward.  Nevertheless, I wish Phil had, at least just once, recorded an ""unrehearsed"" session with Oscar and Ray Brown:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonny-Stitt-Sits-in-With-the-Oscar-Peterson-Trio/dp/B001G9LVLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonny Stitt Sits in With the Oscar Peterson Trio</a>, or with just Ray and a few chords by Jimmy Jones:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-York-Jazz/dp/B000W00YHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New York Jazz</a>&nbsp;(or, to those who prefer the irresistible groove of Wynton Kelly, a session like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cannonball-Takes-Charge/dp/B000TENFTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cannonball Takes Charge</a>).",1349740800,4,8212,5.549679487179487
8053617,5,B0007XT83A,"This is a wonderful film, especially the scenes of Phil Woods and fellow musicians making a first class CD.  (When he plays Quintessence, you want to weep at the beauty and sensitivity.) I was surprised that Phil talked here rather frankly about his life and times.  Over the decades I've seen the greatest alto sax player alive, he would barely acknowledge the audience's presence. With his leather cap tightly drawn down to his eyebrows, he seemed to be trying to be like Miles, telling all of us that he was so very cool.  One night in Chicago, I heard him sneer at the crowd, ""I'm not here to entertain you.""  In this film, however, the elderly Woods seems very humane and reflective.  He makes a single reference to ""Chan,"" and for that painful story of Woods you need to read the memoirs of his ex-wife, Chan Parker.  The book has the same title as this DVD.",1240963200,,864,4.506410256410256
8053618,5,B0007XT83A,"Thank God for a player of Phil Woods' caliber who doesn't subscribe to the increasingly pervasive ""jazz nazi"" mindset that seems to relish the distance between player and listener. Woods could easily justify being a complete snob but has chosen a path that finds humor, joy and humility right there with extreme devotion to an art form. Brilliant musician, soulful human being, top-shelf credentials...well worth investigating. I love this guy!",1219795200,,444,5.357142857142857
8053619,5,B0007XT83A,"As a lifelong fan of Phil Woods, I found this DVD to be a great addition to my library.

This DVD give us a wonderful insight into the trials and triumphs of this great jazz musician.  The setting takes place in a recording studio as they are putting together Phil's album, ""This Is How I Feel About Quincy.""  (This album is also available from Amazon and is highly recommended.)

I have followed Phil since the ""Sixties"" when I first heard him play.  I also am a saxophonist.

It is very common for a young player to model their technique on a master.  Phil Woods was mine, and remains so to this very day.

Phil's mastery of the alto sax is demonstrated in this DVD.  Listen to ""The Quintessence,""  a smokey/moody tune written by Q.  This performance is a great forum for Phil's masterful technique, rich and glossy.

He is simply the best.

This DVD is a ""must have"" if you want the inside scoop on the history of the foremost altoist in jazz.",1168128000,4,946,4.398843930635838
