8694542,5,B00R8ILEHA,I have volunteered with RAM several times and enjoyed this film. Well done. I have meet several of the workers and this give you a good sense of who they are.,1455494400,,158,4.129032258064516
8694543,5,B00R8ILEHA,"Sarah, another arrogant doctor. Leave the profession and join Wall Street. This documentary nails it good. Many people, myself included, have no access to medical care. I don't have a thousand each month to get insurance. I have a cracked tooth. I just have to live with it. I have Sciatica and I have to live with it. Each night I can hardly go to bed. So Sarah, not everyone has a suitcase filled with cash. If I had cancer and went to M.D. Anderson, they want $37,000 before they let you in the door.",1435795200,3,503,4.3052631578947365
8694544,5,B00R8ILEHA,The people who do this work are amazing. It is a tremendous effort to provide services to people who need it.  You can tell they wish they could do more. It paints a picture of the serious issues regarding access to health care in our country.,1427500800,5,243,4.282608695652174
8694545,5,B00R8ILEHA,"Sarah S., the doctor?, who wrote the previous review has obviously never volunteered at a RAM event. I saw this documentary and am a volunteer dentist for RAM. The film is a must see. Appalachia is  an under served area where access to health care is an epidemic.  The people here are victims. Any other characterization is wrong. See the film. As the head of RAM says in the film...""welcome to America"". See the film!!!",1426550400,5,420,4.586666666666667
8694546,2,B00R8ILEHA,"I was expecting more coverage about physician shortages and the added costs associated with untreated chronic illness.  Instead, I learned a lot about some very unfortunate folks in ?Tennessee who don't brush their teeth. The folks were to me an element of our society that leaves me with very little empathy for their plight. I feel anger at a government who has promulgated an entire subset of our nation who take little or no responsibility for themselves, because they have allowed themselves to depend on handouts. Of course they are too small!  They were intended to be supplements! Not the whole meal!  I am a physician and not a dentist in part, because rotten teeth make me gag. There were far too many in this DVD. Any attempt to create any empathy for these uneducated lazy creeps was as they say, close, but no cigar. Yuck!",1426377600,,835,4.705479452054795
