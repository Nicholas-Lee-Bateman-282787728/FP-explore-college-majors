8289508,5,B001CU13R6,I found this Jeopardy game to be an excellent training tool. We use it at the end of our Lean Six Sigma training sessions. It takes about 30 minutes and has everyone engaged.  Can't ask for more for the price!,1323907200,,209,4.225
8289509,5,B001CU13R6,The Lean Office Jeopardy Game is the best way to reinforce Lean concepts in a engaging way.  It only takes about 30 minutes to conduct this activity and will have everyone talking about Lean!  We use it at all our training sessions and have modified it accordingly.,1226016000,,265,4.617021276595745
8289510,5,B001CU13R6,"It's not always easy to hold the attention of Healthcare workers at the end of a training session. They are busy people and all have places to be and things to do. However, when we used the ""Lean Healthcare Jeopardy Game"" at the end of our training session for a client hospital they didn't want to leave. We made a big production out of it with the Jeopardy theme music and prizes. We ran several sessions and when the word got out about the game at the end, the next group came in and paid special attention to the session so they could do well in the game.

We now use this tool to supplement all our Lean training sessions. The nice thing about it is that it can be used for a group review at the end of the session or as an individual learning tool after initial training has been completed. Very creative and easy to use. You can make it as simple or as elaborate as you want.",1219190400,2,882,4.157894736842105

The nice thing about it is that it can be used for a group review at the end of the session or as an individual learning tool after initial training has been completed. Very creative and easy to use. You can make it as simple or as elaborate as you want with prizes and extra production. We even downloaded the Jeopardy theme and played it in the background.

8289513,5,B001CU13R6,"We found this Jeopardy Game as the answer to what was missing in our Lean training session.  We now conclude our sessions with this 30 minute activity.  We use The Lean Healthcare Pocket Guide as the class material, and now use the supplemental questions provided (in the Microsoft Word document included on the CD) as customizing the game to each training session - as new tools are reviewed and discussed. We have modified this version to include our Six Sigma training also.  The PowerPoint file (and the 100s of additional questions for use) is the best buy in the market for Lean training support.  Highly recommended!",1218844800,,623,4.849056603773585
