8627458,2,B00GTSVO4I,"I am interested in evolving as a musician and songwriter, so when I saw this DVD set at the library I hoped it would be helpful and offer inspiration as well as tips. As it turned out, I couldn't get past the 1st episode. My wife agreed; she wanted to EITHER hear what he had to say OR hear his music whereas I couldn't stand his monotonous talking NOR his monotonous singing. So we turned it off. Intolerable, to me.",1442620800,,417,4.225
8627459,4,B00GTSVO4I,"I received a screener of this two DVD set direct from the producers for review. The title interested me because I cover a lot of what are best called singer/songwriters and a review a lot of CDs from Nashville-based musicians who are what are called Americana artists (think Waylon, Willie, Townes). I guess I expect that to be the style of music here, but it isnt. No, Im not saying that the six songwriters (sometimes a duo) included on the six (approx.) 30-minute episodes are not good songwriters, its just that they are more rock or, maybe alternative, in their music styles.

First a few observations to guide you: Though the title says this is Season One, to my knowledge, these episodes where never broadcast anywhere and are being released just on DVD.
Each episode features an interview with the songwriter (and in some cases other members of the band) with ultra-brief clips of the person (or band) performing. Throughout the interview their music is played in the background. This really detracts from hearing the interview and  just as important  you cant hear the lyrics (and the subject is  remember  songwriting, not performing). The DVD set has  as bonuses  one full song by each of the six artists. A few are music videos while others have the person singing after they were interviewed. This does give you a sample of their work.

I think the benefit to others from this series (and DVD collection) is that those musicians who are wondering how others started writing and performing (and unless Im wrong, none of the interviewees is over the age of 30) and how they tried to get their music to the public. And the two producers have their hearts in the right place. Im giving this four stars (Amazons code for I like it) though I do hope that, should there be a follow-up, the producers eliminate that soundtrack and let the songwriter perform at various points during the interview. I think that would work best.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8627460,5,B00GTSVO4I,"We chose these songwriters because because of their honesty in their choice of careers - we captured them in their environments - the same environments that most aspiring songwriters work in. As a 20 year veteran of the music industry on the other side of the glass and working with songwriters daily, they get to be a lot more than clients - they become friends. I hear the stories behind the songs, and a lot of times they are truly moving. These are real people out there trying to make a living in a business that is changing rapidly and are trying to adapt to new business models.

All of the performances in each of these videos are live performances, no auto tune, no editing, these guys are the real deal and we believe in them and believe in supporting our (right now) local music scenes - and this is our way to do it. This is truly a labor of love of and we hope that it shows through in the final product.

8627461,5,B00GTSVO4I,No bull...just honest folks pouring out their hearts. The world needs more of these ballsie songwriters to fill our airways and souls. Really enjoy this series.,1395360000,3,160,5.1923076923076925
8627462,5,B00GTSVO4I,"One of the toughest challenges to a songwriter is that they tend to work alone. Second to that is that hearing from other songwriters is rare. This series offers insights and, most importantly, inspiration to someone endeavoring to write songs. While it covers a variety of styles, at the core of each episode is how these professionals took an idea for a song and turned it into a song. What inspires them? Did technology play a role? How was rhythm employed. As a songwriter myself (though unpublished), I found this series to be well worth the modest investment.",1395014400,2,565,4.775510204081633
8627463,5,B00GTSVO4I,"This is a great video series for someone that has an inkling they may want to be a songwriter.  Through the journeys of the various songwriters profiled, aspiring songwriters will surely resonate with one or more of the stories.  By profiling different genres of musicians and writers, this series shows that there are many ways to plug in as a songwriter, along with providing insight into what it takes to achieve success.  I was able to get an advanced copy of this DVD through contacts at the studio I use to record song demoes.  Very impressed with this series.",1391904000,3,566,4.686868686868687
