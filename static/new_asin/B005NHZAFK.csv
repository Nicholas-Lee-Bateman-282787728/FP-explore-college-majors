4847648,5,B005NHZAFK,"Wouldn't say it's better or worse than the US version, just hilarious on it's own merits. Disc labeling was a bit weird--if I remember right, disc 4 had the Xmas special as opposed to disc 2 or 3. I forget how it works, just didn't make sense when I actually watched through.",1360022400,4,275,4.3076923076923075
4847649,5,B005NHZAFK,I was looking for the BBC version of The Office (the original).  I had a difficult time locating it in any of the local stores.  I found it in less than a couple of minutes on Amazon.  My son was really surprized and pleased with the gift.,1325635200,7,239,4.042553191489362
4847650,5,B005NHZAFK,"First of all, far too few episodes!

This show mastered the ""let's see how long an uncomfortable moment be funny"" department.  I can't really tell you my very fave moment from the whole thing...there were so many.  Like when David does his...uh ""dance"" in an effort to upstage Neil's SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER tribute.  See, I can't even get started.

Of all of my American friends who are fans of the US version, only a very few have seen the UK version.  It's a shame.

BUT, at the end of the day, this is a classic and is def in my top 5 fave comedy shows!",1324339200,17,554,4.219047619047619
4847651,5,B005NHZAFK,"This version of The Office is far funnier than the American version.  It is the battle between British comedy and American comedy and for my money British comedy wins.  Ricky Gravais is the master of this type of satirical comedy and this is a classical example of his best work,  A must have for anybody's DVD collection.",1477440000,,322,4.614035087719298
4847652,3,B005NHZAFK,"The Office, as done in the US, was such a fantastic series, and I was addicted.  I do have the collection of those dvds, too.  I have tried to watch the UK version, but it seemed surreal to me, being almost word for word of the US series.  I may like it better if I try it again at a later date.",1477008000,,295,3.725806451612903
4847653,5,B005NHZAFK,"Had to use he subtitles to make sure I picked up on all the fun British dialogue- this version includes the essential two Christmas specials which made the whole series complete.  Love this show, the characters, and the off-kilter jokes which catch you off guard and throw in all kinds of cultural references that help clue us in on the hohum drudgery that is life in a modern, imperfect and forced-politically correct workplace in the UK.  Some great deleted scenes and gag real footage and even includes music videos and disco dancing practice scenes. <3",1466985600,2,556,4.842105263157895
4847654,2,B005NHZAFK,"The show is great.  Five stars for The Office, but I don't like this DVD set.  Whoever produced this 10th Anniversary set decided to have a bunch of EPK-style interviews before each episode begins, and have talking head segments play over the closing credits of certain episodes, which are annoying and ruin the general feeling of the episode.  Perhaps I'm splitting hairs here, but when I pay for a show or movie, I expect the full version of said show or movie minus all the annoying nonsense that would likely come with broadcast versions, which means the credits and intros remain intact.  I realize to many, this won't be a big deal, but it is to me.  If I had known then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought this version.",1455408000,8,730,4.5
4847655,5,B005NHZAFK,"This is the original version of The Office made in the UK in 2001, and while the style of humor does differ from the American version, I still find it to be a brilliant show! Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant proved themselves to be an amazing writing team for this series. Dry humor, awkward situations, well-written characters that you either sympathize with or outright dislike, and the story wrapping up nicely at the end with the Christmas special. I find some of the stories and characters to be especially darker in some ways compared to their US equivalents on the NBC version. For example, David Brent, the boss at Wernham-Hogg paper merchants, is practically despicable compared to Michael Scott, who's still awkward like Brent but a bit of a more light-hearted character, and he has very few redeeming qualities. But then you still end up feeling bad for him at some parts in the series, and he'll seem like not that bad of a guy. And Tim, compared to Jim, is a bit more depressed and fearful of revealing his true feelings for Dawn, the receptionist. I just love the way the series and characters overall have been written, and this is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys a nicely-written series, a dry-humored comedy, or British comedy in general.

On a side note, there is a feature length film about David Brent coming in the next year or so. Merchant has no involvement, but let's hope it turns out to be as good and as memorable as the original series he was featured in.",1452038400,,1486,4.628787878787879

4847659,3,B005NHZAFK,"This was the Anniversary version and the first episodes started with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant and others telling me how funny it is. I really don't think Matthew Perry is qualified to tell me anything, much less how funny something will be. Fortunately I figured out how to jump past that crap and get to the actual episodes. The stories were fairly entertaining, but funny as hell? Not. Sorry. In some episodes there were some laugh out loud moments, but this was not something to write home about. Some moments were actually tedious. At least it is better than the crappy American version. One episode of that and I was done.

The redeeming quality of this entire series is the story within the story. I don't want to be the spoiler, so I won't give it away, but it does make the rest of series worth enduring. If it weren't there this would have earned only one star.",1410480000,,880,4.534591194968553

4847661,3,B005NHZAFK,"We have watched the complete series of the American version 3 times though and loved it, but we watched the first 5-6 episodes of this so far just couldn't get interested in the British version. After seeing Steve Carrell play Michael Scott, anyone else just isn't the same. I know this was the basis for the American version, and I think if we'd watched this w/o having seen the American version it would have been great. But it's hard to get the American characters out of your head when watching this one if you've seen the American version first. So I'm constantly comparing the two, and just have to rate this one as ok.",1396656000,2,625,4.491228070175438

4847663,5,B005NHZAFK,"Ricky gervais is a comedy genius and this series is my all-time favorite. (I like the American series of the same name a lot, but it is a very different cup of tea.) Gervais and Merchant  are quoted as saying that the long arc and the central plot of the movie was always the love story of Dawn and Tim. When that was wrapped up in the Christmas episode, the story was over and the series ended. For me, the pathos of Gervais's fragile, self deluded character David is equally compelling. His semi epiphany in the final episode when he finds the promise of a long term romance with a woman who, against all odds, seems to accept and even like him, is a terrific pay off. I think the writing of this comedy is much tighter and more carefully plotted than it seems. The pseudo documentary, reality tv format gives it a spontaneous, adlibbed feeling that is misleading. I also love the soundtrack which grounds the series in time and place and also comments on the themes and the realities of the post industrial, post Thatcher workers'  lives. Oops. Mostly it is just terribly funny and sometimes terribly moving.",1386892800,4,1111,4.55
4847664,4,B005NHZAFK,"Great product, good quality, This guy is mazingly funny when serious with such a dry sense of humour. It is well worth watching",1385942400,3,127,4.565217391304348

4847666,4,B005NHZAFK,"Hard-hitting, edgy, and with a razor-sharp wit that can come only from Britain, ""The Office"" is the darker older brother of the American series.  The British series certainly has its differences from the American one - no soap opera-worthy protracted romances, less slapstick, and fewer guffaw-out-loud moments.  What it does have, however, is a humorous take on the abuse of power by people who shouldn't have any power to begin with.  Such is the corporate life for those trapped inside.",1384905600,3,489,5.0875
4847667,5,B005NHZAFK,"While maybe not as laugh out loud as Extras, this one holds a special place in my heart.  The awkward comedy, and the genuine characters are wonderful.  Anybody who's ever worked a crappy office job should find something to relate to.",1384473600,2,234,4.682926829268292
4847668,5,B005NHZAFK,I can remember watching this when it was airing the first time around and thinking how uncomfortable the characters made me. That's a sure sign an actor and the writing is done well. When you feel the tension in a scene. I was glad the made the US version but will always remember and appreciate this original series.,1383091200,2,317,4.482758620689655
4847669,5,B005NHZAFK,I am still watching this set weeks later it has to be repeated often. I can hardly contain myself as the laughter rolls on. If you have never met a David Brent you have never been employed...The only thing that is missing in this set is the infamous Microsoft Training videos that have long been popular on YouTube. You do get renewed extras and even some music videos. Don't hold back one of the most side-splitting TV shows to ever traverse the pond.,1380153600,5,452,4.457831325301205
4847670,5,B005NHZAFK,"This original version is great. I picked it up for $5 to round out my The Office library, although I had previously watched this series. The jokes are funny and the characters are perfect. I guess a comedy in the office setting really translates no matter upon which side of the pond you live.",1378684800,5,293,4.444444444444445

8480478,1,B005NHZAFK,Have not watched yet. My mistake....I thought I was getting the U S version. I love British humor. It should be fun.,1521676800,,116,4.318181818181818

8480480,1,B005NHZAFK,I'm hoping that there is some point to this series. So far it's been just a plethora of locker-room humor with a British accent. Would not recommend purchasing.,1509494400,,160,4.75
