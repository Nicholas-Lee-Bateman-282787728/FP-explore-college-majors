6068166,3,B00G9J7QQC,"1. To my regret, significant proportion of music blurays have provided 16 bit stereo track instead of 24 bit. In fact, this is not desirable, but providing wrong information is even worse. 2014 VPO New Year's Concert Bluray conducted by Barenboim has misled consumers indicating stereo sound is 24 bit! Is this Sony's simple mistake or intentional cheating?

2. Barenboim is much better than Welser-Moest in 2011 & 2013.",1393718400,,420,5.086956521739131

6068168,3,B00G9J7QQC,"This DVD is really terrific but not what I expected.  I expected to see the PBS version with the ballet performing several numbers and the dialog given by Julie Andrews.  There is no dialog with this DVD and it goes from one number to the other without a pause.  There is no historical conversation with it..  That's one of the wonderful things with the PBS version, it tells lots of little things re the composers and the surroundings and is quite informative.  I do love the music and really enjoy the conductor but the DVD fell a bit short of expectation.",1392336000,3,558,4.485148514851486

My only disappointment is that the portions including Julie Andrews are not included. Her observations on the PBS program of this concert made the music and history of Vienna come alive!",1391817600,2,280,4.62
6068170,5,B00G9J7QQC,"Prequel:

The precise reason for the unusual headline to this review is a response to the previous reviews written weeks before the Blu-ray disc was released and, in one case, a review written weeks before the concert!

I notice there are also reviews of the DVD version that fail to mention that one of the two supplied discs plays the same content as the other much to the irritation to some purchasers. That experience also apparently applied to the replacement discs. One reviewer has complained about the 'locked region' nature of this region-free disc and that is simply wrong and damaging to the manufacturer and misleading to potential purchasers.

As regards reviews based on the television broadcast and not the actual disc product, it is important to know that the presentation of the program is not what was seen during the broadcast as regards the ballet sequences and that the sound is processed to a much higher level than possible for a broadcast. Finally, the reviews written before receipt of the discs do not make any mention of the extensive bonus features.

Early reviews such as those are simply not helpful, are at best misleading and at worst are mischief making.
...................................................................................
The following is a review of the actual Blu-ray disc as received:

The first thing to note is that this disc is fully labelled and described as 'Regions A, B, C (worldwide)' by Sony and that is exactly how it plays. There are therefore no problems about basic playback.

The second thing to note is that it was recorded with 24 bit technology. Given good playback systems, this disc will far outperform the broadcast quality of reproduction. In fact the Master DTS 5.1 (also stereo) sound is of demonstration quality with impressive range and stage depth. The imaging is a further improvement over previous issues, if only because of the impressive way the contrasts between the bright (ceiling lights) and dark aspects of the exposure range is so well handled without burn-out on highlight detail. Otherwise the imaging offers full range colour, good skin tones and is in every way a high quality product.

The program itself is interesting in so far as it contains an unusually high number of first performances at this series of concerts. Not only are there 9 in all but their placing is unusual in so far as two of the first three pieces are new in this way and that the remaining 7 take up nearly half the items in the normally popular second half of the concert.

Barenboim, in this his second appearance after his 2009 dbut, has a real impact upon proceedings too. As the extensive sleeve notes, written by the orchestra's chairman, state - parts of the first half program were chosen to reflect Barenboim's long-term commitment to peace. Thus the Caroline Galop represents the joining of the inner and outer cities in Vienna and the Egyptian March reflects Barenboim's involvement with the West-Eastern Divan orchestra. Other such connections are the Palms of peace waltz, the Receive My Embrace Ye millions waltz and the Stormy in Love and Dance polka. On another linked topic, the opening Helen Quadrille was played as a tribute to Elena Bashkirova, Barenboim's wife.

Interpretively, Barenboim offers a more interventionist approach to many of the pieces in the sense that there is more emphasis upon expression than dance as regards chosen tempi. Essentially these are more like concert performances rather than Viennese dances. Thus many of the introductions, especially those to the waltzes, are unusually slow followed by variations of tempi within the actual dance sections that would be foreign to those used to Boskovski's earlier approach, very familiar in their CD format. The Egyptian march is taken at a particularly steady pace.

The complete ballet sequences to Die Romantiker and to Pizzicati are both presented as bonus features and are thus separated from the broadcast version when they were inter-cut with the concert footage. At this point it is worth noting the spectacular costuming designed by Vivienne Westwood, though as a regular kilted Scottish dancer, I have never before seen such female kilted attire or such male cloaks! The dancing is, as usual, beautifully presented with attractive choreography by Ashley Page.

There are two sequences of views around Vienna seen during the Caroline Galop and the Tales from the Vienna Woods, both as broadcast.

On the subject of bonuses, there is also an extended, largely wordless, documentary entitled 'Backstage 2014' which gives an informative and interesting idea of the complexities behind such a production from all aspects of staging, recording, dancing, music and hall presentations such as the flowers. All of this is accompanied by appropriate musical extracts played by the orchestra.

The final unique feature was Barenboim's journey of handshaking thanks to every individual member of the orchestra as the orchestra played the closing Radetzky March. This, perhaps unintentional reference back to the peace theme of the first half of the program, is very much how Barenboim prefers to conclude his concerts. In this he is not alone and the temporary lack of a conductor did not deter the audience from joining in with the usual clapping. Their support was clear in the enthusiastic applause which concluded the concert.

This then is a well recorded and region-free disc documenting the 2014 concert - one very much with its own character as might be expected from Barenboim, a free-thinking international figure on the world's stage for peace.

6068185,1,B00G9J7QQC,"The most disappointing NY concert I have ever heard.  The sound was poor, couldn't hear the soft passages but worst of all the chosen works were dull and the orchestra whom I always believe can play without a conductor, was lacking enthusiasm and fun which the European conductors - e.g. Riccardo Mutti etc - always bring to them.  Daniel Barenboim spent more time posing and appeared more interested in himself.

I think the Vienna Ph are the best in the world when it comes to playing the type of music they are famous for.  I speny a lot of time looking at the expressions on the players and they looked as if they were simply going through the motions which is not like them at all.

Lets hope next year they choose a conductor who actually feels the music and therefore theyorchestra gives them their all.",1405555200,4,810,4.52054794520548
