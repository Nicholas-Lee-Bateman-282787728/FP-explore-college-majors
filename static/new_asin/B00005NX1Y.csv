7947929,5,B00005NX1Y,"I have watched this movie many times, it is actually a movie recommended at the qi gong academy where I practice.  The movie is entertaining and contains good dialog and some fun scenes.  There are many subtle and less subtle messages about ying yang wisdom and zen philosophy:
1) Life and nature are unpredictable, we must learn zen through our minds.
2) We can learn the basics from a teacher but mastery comes from within.
3) Many more.
I highly recommend watching the movie many times, I pick something new up every time!",1214352000,3,525,4.634408602150538
7947930,1,B00005NX1Y,"Far from depicting the life of the founder of the Zen school of Chinese Buddhism, this film is more or less a glorified kung-fu movie in the typical fashion of that genre of chinese films with interspersed lame attempts at philosphical discourse, and offers little insight into the character of Bodhidharma, Buddhism or the beginnings of the Zen School in China.",1090800000,9,362,4.950819672131147
