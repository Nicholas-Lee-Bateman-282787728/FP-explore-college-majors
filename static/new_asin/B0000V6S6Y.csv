8003402,5,B0000V6S6Y,"One of my all time favorite Bollywood movies. I saw it in the movie theater when I was in my early teens, and loved it then. I got it as a gift on videotape years later, It is great that it is available as a DVD. Wonderful music and songs, beautiful sets and costumes, great scenes shot on the campus of Aligarh Muslim University. A very romantic classic film from a bygone era. Every Bollywood aficionado should own a copy.",1410393600,,424,4.3125
8003403,5,B0000V6S6Y,"I love old movies and I love old Indian/Pakistani movies. This is a nice story of the after effects of the fall of the Indian Muslims culture in the middle 20th century. It is a shame that these things happened during the British occupation, but the culture of the Indian states and countries had seen its best times and were ready to cut each others throats when the Brits came in ""peace in the 18th/19th century. This is full of music and has subtitles. It helps if you have a Urdul speaking friend to get the cultural aspect but it is a nice movie...a classic.",1375574400,,563,4.371428571428571
8003404,5,B0000V6S6Y,"This movie excels in portraying the features that make Bollywood movie industry both distinctive and such a producer of elevating aesthetic and moral treats. This view is supported by the fact that Filmfare Best Art Direction Award went to the art director Sudhendu Roy for Mere Mehboob in 1964. ""Mere Mehboob"" also won the Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film in Hindi for 1963. The music by Naushad and the lyrics penned by Shakeel Badayuni are out of this world! The sets and visual arrangements are stunning. The enchanting songs include: ""Mere Mehboob Tujhe"",  ""Tere Pyar Mein Dildar"" , ""E - Husn Jara Jaag"" and the much-overlooked hauntingly lyrical ""Yaad Mein Teri"" . The song ""Mere Mehboob Tujhe"" was the popular hit upon release. It is composed on raga Jhinjhoti and  was later translated into Malayalam, with  slight adaptations, by M. S. Baburaj, to give two all time classic songs, ""Thamasamenthe Varuvaan"" (from Bhargavi Nilayam) and ""Pranasakhi Njan Verumoru"" (from Pareeksha).

  ""Mere Mehboob"" is a 1963 Indian film directed by Harnam Singh Rawail and features stellar performances by the actors Rajendra Kumar, Sadhana, Ashok Kumar, Nimmi, Pran, Johnny Walker and Ameeta. The film was a ""blockbuster"" and took the number one position at the box office in that year. It showcases a background from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh and traditional Lucknow. The plot revolves around the love story of a college girl portrayed by Sadhna and  a college youth played by Rajendar Kumar. The young man bumps into the girl one day and suddenly finds himself falling hopelessly in love with her. One big probelm is that, since the girl was wearing a traditional burkha, he has not seen her face and has no idea who she is. He has touched her hands. The remaining part explains how he finds her. Over-discreet inquiries and misunderstandings lead to a series of mistaken identities and misdirected romances. One enchanting aspect of the movie is that it is a beautiful reflection of the old-time genteel culture of Lucknow. Besides the one actual Filmfare Award for Best Art Direction, ""Mere Mehboob"" also received a total of six Filmfare Award nominations, including the three for performances by  Nimmi, Johnny Walker and Ameeta. The love and nobility depicted in this movie is so far from the senseless and violent word of Hollywood!",1361577600,,2361,5.051413881748072
