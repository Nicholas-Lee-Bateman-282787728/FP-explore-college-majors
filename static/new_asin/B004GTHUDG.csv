8428986,3,B004GTHUDG,Great footage of the rampage. It is amazing what these guys do on a mtn bike. The blu ray makes you feel like your there espcially during the helmet cam segments. My complaint is for the price its not a very long video. Soundtrack is ok. Should have been more biking and less watching the guys driving to the contest. Would definitly wait till the price drops.,1297036800,,360,4.388059701492537
