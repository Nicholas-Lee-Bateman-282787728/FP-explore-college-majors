5192466,5,B008YVFIH2,We enjoyed this DVD tremendously.  Samuel Morris made a huge difference at Taylor University and has statues of him there.  His greatest desire was to learn about the Holy Spirit and this young Liberian ended up teaching his teachers by his powerful testimony and love for his fellow man.,1421366400,,288,4.857142857142857

5192468,4,B008YVFIH2,"I had not expected ""animation"" as part of this documentary.  Nor was it listed as a documentary, but should have been.  I had expected a dramatic performance by good actors, portraying the life of this wonderful young man, who obviously was called (and sent) by God, but perhaps this was the only thing that could be done.  I am very glad to learn of such a wonderful life, however short, that accomplished so much.  We need a ""Samuel Morris"" today.--",1409702400,,451,4.6

5192492,5,B008YVFIH2,"This story is an amazing story of a young man's perseverance in following what he knew what God wanted him to do. The logistics of how it came to pass at that time in history are completely unusual and almost unbelievable. Of course, we know it was believable, since it is a true story. I was spellbound as to how this turned out.
I would recommend it to anyone for the inspiration it provides.",1486166400,,394,4.337837837837838

5192499,5,B008YVFIH2,"Great service, fast delivery from the shipper.

It is truly unfortunate and sad that this is listed under childrens books
I had never heard of Samuel Morris before reading this biography which was recommended by a friend. It sounded too good to be true, so I did a bit of research and was blown away by what I found.  It is all true; he truly put his faith in action and obeyed because he believed the Word. How this world would be changed if we all just truly put action to our intellectual understanding of the Bible.

Samuels story is an inspiration to hear God's voice and follow His leading. I have purchased several books and given them away. I highly recommend this book.",1482883200,,678,4.451612903225806

5192522,5,B008YVFIH2,"He was a true man of God and an inspiration for his brothers and sisters in Christ. The intimate walk he had with God is available for all who will  pray and obey and trust as he did. God is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Hebrews 11:16.  Jesus in the book of John 14:12- 18 "" I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to my Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name. so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in My name and I will do it. If you love Me you will obey My command. And I will ask the Father and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever -- the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him.

5192549,1,B008YVFIH2,"Sammy Morris may have been a wonder, a boy struck by the power of God. This film, however, is a badly made public relations gimmick.  Sammy Morris was and is a tool in the hands of self righteous, self seeking, pompous manipulators. His story needs to inspires. The obnoxious background music does not disguise the fact that stiff, wooden men using stiff wooden words do not to tell a story that inspires. The black man, who was used in too few scenes, was a relief to see and hear in an otherwise terrible film.",1470182400,,512,4.446808510638298

8532794,5,B008YVFIH2,"Excellent documentary on the life of Samuel Morris. The way that this was presented was very well done. I enjoyed the animation-style illustrations throughout the documentary. This enhanced the production. I did not know anything about Samuel Morris (Prince Kaboo) until this viewing. He went through much hardship and struggles in his native country of Liberia at such a young age. Then his trip to the United States in the late 1800's had problems as well. But Samuel had a faith that grew stronger every day and nothing would stop him. He came to know and love God so much that he spread that love and knowledge to others with surprising results. Even though he lived a short life, his effect on those he encountered lasted a lifetime. This is an extraordinary story with great commentary, footage, and illustrations that I am sure will leave viewers inspired and awed. As one of the persons from the documentary mentioned"" ""the power of the Holy Spirit bears fruit that lasts forever"". That is so true with Samuel Morris.",1497916800,3,1025,4.829545454545454
8532795,4,B008YVFIH2,The story of Samuel Morris is a powerful depiction of a life captured by the love of God. Like many christian mystics his life held elation and unbearable suffering that was made meaningful by his direct experiences with God.  The reimagining of his brief life strums the heart strings and is like a brisk wind that keeps you in its grip until it fades away. The world needs more men and women like Samuel Morris!,1497398400,,413,4.506666666666667
