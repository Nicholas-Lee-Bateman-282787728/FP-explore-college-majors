7920926,4,B00004RF8D,"A very clever script with some very well written situation comedy.  I tried getting my teenage daughter to watch this, she thought it was extremely stupid, so the audience has to be right.  I thought she'd enjoy it.  I've watched it a couple of times and still found it entertaining and funny.
Murray plays a hapless American caught up in a ring of international espionage while thinking that he is just playing the part in an audience participation stage play in London.  A lessor actor in this film and  it would have a a complete dud, but Murray's talent shines and there aren't any dull moments.  A scene near the end has him dancing with Russians while unknowingly stopping a time bomb, it is very well choreographed and lots of fun to watch.  This movie is a strong recommendation to any that like Murray and his talent of being funny while seemingly not trying to be.  It is a good recommendation to any that enjoy clever situation comedy and aren't expecting ""What about Bob?"" or ""Groundhog Day"" which this film is not.",1005955200,,1027,4.604395604395604
7920927,5,B00004RF8D,"One of Murray's better one's .  Pic is a take off on a classic 30's film, The Man Who Knew Too Much.  A reel goodie.  In this one, Bill thinks that he is in a live (off stage) play, but little does he know that he is a target.  Yeah, I know, it's been done before, but not with Bill.  Get it.  Sit down and watch it.  Enjoy it.  Don't forget the popcorn....Aloha",1005091200,,362,3.863013698630137
7920928,5,B00004RF8D,"This show is hilarious.  It is a perfect family show because there is little or no vulgarity.  Bill Murray is hysterical as an unsuspecting mid westerner who has stumbled onto a major assassination plot in London.  He has no idea what is really going on and yet plays the part beautifully to the end.  We laughed so hard during one part we had tears in our eyes.  He is one of the great comedic men and according to my friend who has actually met him, he's this funny in real life too.",972000000,6,485,4.228260869565218
7920929,5,B00004RF8D,"The first time i saw this movie i was in a movie theater and i couldn't stop laughing! I knew that i had to get the tape so i did. It is a little confusing in the very begining but once you see it a second time it makes a lot more sense. It's about Bill Murray's character who is brother's with Peter Gallagher's character. Bill goes to England(where his brother lives)for Bill's birthday. Peter gives him a ticket to ""the theater of life""- a performance you play as the main character. In the performance, it takes you around town acting as if it were real life only there are actors everywhere to help you along the way. It sounds confusing but you'll understand when you see it. Anyway, Bill loves the present but somethng goes wrong. Bill get's mixed up with the wrong people who think he's a killer but Bill thinks it's all part of ""the theater of life"". but it's not the performance, it's real life! Bill get's close to dying so many times but he doesn't even realize how much danger he's in. All throughout the movie Bill thinks it's just a performance. In the end everything turns out fine and he even get's the girl! The only thing i didn't like was that Peter Gallagher was Bill Murray's brother, they don't look anything alike and Peter's really ugly! But other than that it was a hilarious movie and you're really missing out if you haven't seen it! go see it now before it's too late!",970099200,17,1397,4.376923076923077
