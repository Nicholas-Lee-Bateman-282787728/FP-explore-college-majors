3737371,3,B001P42Y9K,An unexceptional series with limited scope. Very British humor but not quite Pythonesque.,1431043200,,89,5.923076923076923

3737373,5,B001P42Y9K,"I am so glad to see Amazon in the USA is finally selling this.  I had bought this complete series through Amazon in Canada, as I could not find it here.  If you enjoyed ""Only When I Laugh"" when you first saw it (for me, that was umpty-ump years ago), it is still funny and delightful now, so many years later.  I only wish Amazon had offered this sooner.",1319587200,16,354,4.101449275362318

3737376,3,B001P42Y9K,"The show is quite entertaining ,relaxing,funny and each episode is about half an hour,dvd can be skipped,return to and rerun again.
The only monotony if you watch continuously ,the scenario never changes which could be fatiguing and become dull and boring.
I would suggest upto two episodes per sitting,if you wish ,you may push three at maximum.",1464912000,4,346,5.087719298245614
3737377,5,B001P42Y9K,"Although somewhat dated, the cast and the characters are typically of the late 1900's. The stories are 2-dimensional and there is a bit of physical humour. It's not the sardonic 2010's-and-later ""comedy."" So, go back in time a bit to somewhat more innocent, somewhat innocuous humour, and enjoy the 1990's actors before they got a chance to really shine in Brit-coms like To the Manor Born and One Foot in the Grave. Some of the walk-ons by stars-to-be are fun, too. Using the too-often-used expression: It's a blast from the past!",1461542400,5,531,4.846153846153846

3737379,4,B001P42Y9K,"I watched this series years ago and remembered it as an amusing view of British social and political issues, in this case, hospitals. Plus, I follow Peter Bowles everywhere! All of the acting is just right for the different characters who reveal their views on ""class"" distinctions in hospital care.

This series, while addressing humorous situations, can be tedious after watching many episodes in a row, but it's worth it if you don't make it a marathon!

I only knew of Bowles' roles in other comedies, so I discovered new British actors, especially the Dr. and the working-class patient who expressed their views with zeal. All in all, this series is done well and the sound and pictures are clear.  I'll watch a few episodes at a time and enjoy the exchanges between the actors. The main objection is the setting becomes rather boring. That's the reason for only 4 Stars.",1459209600,2,876,4.788079470198675

3737383,5,B001P42Y9K,"This is one of the funniest series to ever come out of England.  It is not very ""Python-esque"" but that is to its advantage.  It is a very funny comedy with a wonderful cast.  I LOVE IT!!!!",1442880000,4,189,4.054054054054054

8331967,3,B001P42Y9K,"I agree with a reference book which calls the series ""intermittently rewarding"".  The setting is a ward in a National Health Service hospital. The structure is essentially the relationship between five men: three patients, a surgeon and a male nurse (although the latter does not appear in the fourth series). The patients differ by class, political affiliation and age. Many episodes are pretty run of the mill, with tired humour. For instance, a female patient with a prominent bust complains of feeling 'a great weight on her chest'. Others, though, dig a little deeper. In particular, in one episode, the antagonism, from both surgeon and one patient, towards female doctors is perceptive. Moira Lister dominates another episode portraying an ageing film star who still expects (and usually receives) fan worship. There's an episode on blood transfusion which is an obvious derivative of the legendary Tony Hancock Blood Donor episode - right down to the rarity of the AB-ve blood group. 29 episodes is barely one season in the US, but this was four seasons in the UK. I'm a little puzzled as to how it achieved such success.",1518998400,,1129,5.00531914893617
