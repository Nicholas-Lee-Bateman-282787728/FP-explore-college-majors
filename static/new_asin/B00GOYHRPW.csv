8625898,5,B00GOYHRPW,"Entertaining early-to-mid 60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) horror/adventure film.  A pair of big, beautiful female wrestlers run afoul of a Fu-Manchu type of criminal and his henchmen and also of an inadvertently resurrected Aztec mummy.  Lots of fun and not to be taken seriously.  The VCI Entertainment DVD is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.  Also available in an English-dubbed version from a Something Weird Special Edition DVD double feature (pictured below) under the title Doctor of Doom/Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy.  Also highly recommended.",1454803200,4,595,5.8604651162790695
