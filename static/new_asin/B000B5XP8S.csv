8081857,5,B000B5XP8S,Yup.  The Range Rider and Dick West still ride! On DVD that it is.  And that's good enough.,1501632000,,91,4.0
8081858,5,B000B5XP8S,I was only four when this show was originally airing...and I didn't become a TV kid for another few years....so discovering the great show at this point in my life has been a royal treat...great show....it had some great chemistry to it.,1349481600,,237,4.666666666666667
8081859,4,B000B5XP8S,"Having been born around the time this series was made would not have mattered as I do not feel it made the journey to Western Australia, having now seen it I am happy with my purchase.
It was interesting to see Jackie Coogan apply handcuffs in one episode, clicking them together under one leg looking very effective with no chance of the individual going anywhere.
I did not appreciate one DVD per container so I placed all 5 DVD together in one container,
I have done that a lot over the last few years and a lot of programs made in recent years such as Medium and Jag ended up in the bin to use their containers, quite an expensive process but I prefer my favoured years of the 1950's and 1960's looking good with easy access.",1329782400,,729,4.328467153284672
8081860,4,B000B5XP8S,"Range Rider was my favorite oater in 1956. I even have a`signed Dick Jones pic. I see that most of the time they were either being chased, or chasing something else. But I loved them, and I really flashed back watching Rider climbing on a roof in his mocs, or Dick being rejected by the girl. I will get more. They were gentle times, and my love of guns and physical violence hasn't warped me too much.  I loved watching it again.",1211846400,2,430,4.2439024390243905
8081861,5,B000B5XP8S,"I was ecstatic to be able to buy episodes of the range rider tv series.  I shared a friendship with its star, jock mahoney for 45 years and during that time we had a tough time trying to find episodes of the range rider.  so imagine my surprise and delight to find copies on amazon.",1163030400,7,282,4.109090909090909
8081862,5,B000B5XP8S,"I thought this was the best of the four episodes.  They were all very good but this one, had all the action that the true Western fanatics love.  I continue to admire the excellant skills that these early cowboy stars, both good guys and bad guys, had and how well they projected those skills on screen.  They were absolutely FANTASTIC!!  Of course, my favorites were the fight scenes. Jock Mahoney and Dick Jones truly were masters of their craft. Great actors and stuntmen.",1137628800,14,475,4.686746987951807
