8600394,5,B00E27NH1G,"The film is excellent.  The DVD was well packaged and exactly as described.  I particularly like the German actor Carl Raddatz.  I thought the actual German program which took requests from German soldiers, in front of an entire audience full of them was a film highlight.  This is WELL worth the money!",1484352000,,303,4.769230769230769
8600395,4,B00E27NH1G,"M.G. Watson's review above captures the film very well, and I cannot add to that.

I wish only to add something about the quality of the subtitling, which *mostly* captures the German correctly, but occasionally has some howlers in it, I suspect because the translator is not familiar with military terms in either English or German.  ""Feldwebel"" does NOT translate as ""Field Marshal"", for example, but as ""Sergeant"".  (A moment's reflection would have made it clear that a ""Field Marshal"", the highest commander of the armed forces, would not be running around in the trenches in France preparing to slaughter a pig...)",1442880000,2,620,5.0588235294117645
8600396,4,B00E27NH1G,"It's either amusing or disturbing -- or both -- just how many institutions of today sprang from the scheming brain of Nazi Germany. The Autobahn... modern highways...the Volkswagen...INTERPOL...U.S. military doctrine...the jet engine...the guided missile. Among this cornucopia can be numbered the musical request show. As strange as it may seem today, the idea of ringing up a radio station and asking for a specific song did not originate with radio itself. That medium was around for nearly a generation before a wealthy German told a popular station he'd donate to the cause of their choice if they played a favorite tune of his. Cut to a few years later; WW2 has broken out and the German people are in need of distraction: the Wunschkonzert f&uuml;r die Wehrmacht is born. This was a popular weekly broadcast which allowed civilians and soldiers to request and dedicate songs to loved ones, military units, or whoever they seemed worthy. It featured appearances by all the greatest stars of the day as well as jobbing amateurs and was enormously popular. So it's little wonder Goebbels decided it could feature as the backdrop and inspiration of its own feature film.

WUNSCHKONZERT, in the tradition of other German films of this period such as UBER ALLES IN DER WELT, is actually a number of stories which interweave around a single unifying idea, theme or incident. It begins at the Olympic games in Berlin in 1936, where the lovely Ilse Werner (Inge Wagner) meets and falls in love with Luftwaffe Lieutenant Herbert Koch (Carl Raddatz). After a whirlwind courtship they plan engagement, but he soon receives orders to go to Spain, where the civil war is raging, as a military adviser to the Fascists. The mission is top secret, and thus Koch is forced to abandon his flame without explanation. Eventually she becomes close to another Luftwaffe pilot, Helmut Wilker (Joachim Brennecke), who befriends Koch without realizing they are in love with the same woman. As war breaks out the pilots fly together in combat, neither knowing the other is in love with Ilse. At the same time, there is an extensive sub-plot about a unit of German infantrymen going into battle in France, which involves not only their various loved ones (especially their mothers) but two bumbling soldiers who are sent to Berlin to perform a ditty of their own composition for the Wunschkonzert. As the story goes on, each character's destiny is affected and to some degree decided by their decision to request songs.

As the title implies, WUNSCHKONZERT is not so much about the individual characters in the film per se as the way their lives are tied into, and ultimately effected by, the popular request show. The fate of the two star-crossed lovers, Herbert and Ilse, actually turns on the Olympic fanfare he requests of the program; and in another sequence, the fate of a German infantry squad is decided by one soldier's rendition of a Beethoven song on an organ he finds in a burning French church. There are also performances by real-life celebrities of the day, including the Berlin Philharmonic and Marika R&ouml;kk, arguably THE pin-up girl/singer of the Nazi era next to Lale Anderson. The film is also strong on the theme of men performing their duties in wartime while their women (moms, wives, sweethearts, sisters) wait anxiously at home, and how the music unites them. If all this seems a bit corny, one must remember that this film was released in 1940, and is not measurably sappier or more contrived than British or American romantic war movies of the same era. In fact, I would unhesitatingly say that WUNSCHKONZERT is one of the best WW2-era movies I've yet seen, featuring a skillful balance of romance, propaganda, music, history, and war-movie action, which give the modern viewer a fascinating, if idealized, view of popular culture in Nazi Germany. The acting is good, there are an unusual number of obstacles for the young lovers to face in their quest to be together, a splash of intrigue with the Spanish Civil War angle, a certain amount of pathos, and some entertaining Laurel & Hardy-style moments involving two bumbling soldiers and a captured pig. Like all movies of this type, it tends to blur its focus on the main element of the story towards the end in favor of a grand, all-inclusive climax, but aside from that I had no major complaints.

Believe it or not, though hundreds of feature films were released in Germany during WW2, only twenty or so actually dealt with the war which was taking place at the time, following Goebbels' undoubtedly wise decision that what the people of Germany needed was distraction from the war and not reminders of it. This stands in fascinating contrast to Britain and America, who cranked out war movies nonstop and kept them going long after the war itself had ended. And because of this, WUNSCHKONZERT is just as valuable as historical evidence as it is an entertaining flick in its own right. Like all Americans I grew up on a steady diet of WW2 movies which seldom, if ever, gave even the slightest thought of what the enemy was like -- what he wanted, what he was feeling, why he was fighting, and what was waiting for him when he put away his rifle and went home. WUNSCHKONZERT puts faces and names and hopes and dreams on the dreaded, faceless Nazi soldiers, and it's perhaps no big surprise that these things weren't a helluva lot different for guys named Gotthard, Eberhard and Johannes than they were for the Joes, Mikes and Bobs of the war.  As a German song of the pre-war period refrained: ""All I want is music! I don't need anything else!""",1411257600,6,5607,4.831425598335068
