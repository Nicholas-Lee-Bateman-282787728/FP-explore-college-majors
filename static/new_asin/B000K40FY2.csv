Tae Bo is an excellent way to stay in shape, and learn to defend yourself if the need arises. His boot camp series is focused and specific. Try it!! You'll burn that fat and tone up your entire body, without ever being bored. New each time you work out!!! Practice makes perfect!!!",1304467200,,454,4.481927710843373

I'd added weight basically midsection and after a week I'd lost 1 1/2 inches using the ab workout. It has moves that are so different from the basic ab moves and they target th abs from so many angles it definitely works. I could always do hundreds of crunches, but these really get to the abs. The ultimate bootcamp was exhausting. I am, however, a Tae bo beginner.",1211155200,2,496,4.287234042553192
