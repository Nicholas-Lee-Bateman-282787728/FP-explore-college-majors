2673333,5,B000JJSJO6,"One Night with the King was absolutely awesome!  Everyone MUST SEE THIS FILM!  I absolutely enjoyed this movie and intend to watch it again and again.  It is so straight forward according to the Book of Esther accept at the end when they don't have but one banquet instead of two.  However, where that is eliminated there is other scripture that is added to the movie from Genesis about Jacob and Rachel.  It is absolutely wonderful!  Highly Recommended!

Too me, it did not seem like there was not enough money for this movie to be made because they magnificently portrayed the Biblical days as beautifuly as they could.  However, I was absolutely astonished with the beauty of the architecture from the movie as well as how wonderfully dressed Tiffany Dupont was as ""Queen Esther"".  She was absolutely beautiful.  The actors were absolutely amazing.  The fact that the movie is so scriptural is so very wonderful.  We need more CHRISIANITY FILMS that follows scripture.  It is sometimes difficult to determine the actual lifestyle that one would have had in those days but I think they portrayed that beautifully.",1161561600,11,1115,4.898395721925134
2673334,2,B000JJSJO6,"In the quest for family friendly entertainment and film with Biblical themes, there are a lot of well-meaning people who will review this film as 5-star because the story of Esther is so stirring, and bringing to the big screen is so meaningful.  Esther, a heroine for Jews and Christians alike, is a Biblical queen who hid her faith until she had to reveal it to save her people. Her story, which inspired the Jewish holiday of Purim, is a consummate tale of love conquering religious hatred, and the corruption behind the scenes of a good man in power.

There was not enough budget and certainly not enough directorial skill to make this film laudable.  The film's production values were undermined by the workmanship of the cameras, the lighting, the editing, and the dubious choices made by the director. All told, the effort was less than professional. Murky flashbacks and some stilted dialogue were amateurish; sound quality was poor. There are some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes and costumes in the movie, filmed in India, which was sitting on the shelf since March of 2005.  Director Michael Sajbel should not be placed at the helm of a film again.

In the theater where I saw the movie, there were cheers at the end of the film. No doubt they were from those who were glad to see a Biblical tale brought out as a first run film, without the evils of Hollywood in the way. I understand the sentiment, but fail to understand how many of the viewers could ignore the plainly painful attempts at making this film. The Passion of the Christ, it was not.

I'm somewhat of a student of Esther and have read most of the contemporary treatises of the story and the history. I'm sad and embarrassed that the producers of this film did not put forth a better effort.",1161475200,92,1768,4.6506410256410255
2673335,5,B000JJSJO6,"I found this movie to be all I had heard it was going to be.  I was gripped from the moment it began, knowing and following the Word played out before me on the screen. It held the powerful truth of the Word while having fun and carefree moments between characters. The deep committment to God this young girl held in her heart prevailed through out the movie. It was very believable in presentation and totally captivating.  I would encourage everyone to see this movie and buy the DVD when it is available. This is a movie that believer and non-believer alike will enjoy.",1161129600,8,573,4.5
2673336,5,B000JJSJO6,"Mostly faithful to the story in the Bible, One Night with the King engaged us thoroughly even when we knew what the outcome would be. The visuals are stunning, the acting first-rate. I'm so impressed with the production quality; the movie looks like it cost a lot more to produce than it did. The casting was superb; the two main characters, Esther and Xerxes, have a beautiful chemistry between them. It was delightful to see that chemistry combined with purity in the film.

I plan to take my grandchildren: action and intrigue and a romantic love story, all the while recounting one of the loveliest stories in the Bible.

What a lovely film!",1160956800,7,645,4.699115044247788
2673337,5,B000JJSJO6,"Like ""The Passion of the Christ"" Hollywood has probably overlooked what could be another box office sleeper. A beautifully filmed version of the Old Testament Book of Esther. And when recent months have seen huge drops in movie theater revenue, the motion picture industry should take note, that it doesn't always take $100,000,000 plus budgets to put a finished product up on the big screen that really looks convincing. Made on a budget of somewhere around $20,000,000, ""One Night With The King"" is evidence of that. This looks and feels like so much more. A story of hope and faith for both Jews and Christians, somehow it seems Hollywood just doesn't get that there is an extremely large audience just waiting for more. But with 20th Century-Fox making recent announcement of producing more faith-based films, there could be another Cecil B. DeMille just waiting in the wings. Well worth the price of admission for this long-time movie buff.",1160870400,10,945,4.987341772151899
2673338,5,B000JJSJO6,"I am reviewing this DVD based on seeing the theater release today.  This movie will satisfy both women and men.  For women, it is truly the wonderful love story we have been waiting for.  Here is a young woman who wins the heart of the king by her inner beauty, innocence, and purity of heart and spirit. The movie is free of vulgarity, sexual content, and the other things that keep me away from so many movies. For men, there is intrigue, suspense, the threat of war, strong and noble men, and the sudden ironic twist of fate at the end.  I would encourage you to buy this video because it will inspire you, and it will inspire your teenagers.",1160870400,16,645,4.35

2673348,2,B000JJSJO6,"I feel like there are times that being extremely different from the historical truth or the source material works well for a movie. This is not the case with One Night with the King. Instead of presenting a complex narrative about a time and a place that was very different from ours, it attempts to make basically the same as our time or perhaps WWII. It makes Hamon out to be a cartoonishly evil villain, Esther to be a sort of stupid love-smitten chick, and the king seems awfully trusting and just off for being a king of Persia.

The movie frequently contradicts itself--Esther and Xerxes believe the other is 'cheating', but at the same time, the film acknowledges that Xerxes has concubines, and ignores the heavy, heavy consequence that cheating would have had for Esther. It tries to put in a Western, modern style love story where it does not belong. The dramatic, added in scenes often are less than dramatic and instead sort of drag on, like there wasn't enough material in the Book of Esther to make an entire movie, even though anyone who's read it would know there is enough.

Personally, I would not recommend this movie. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's not really a good film either.",1521936000,,1208,4.613953488372093

2673405,3,B000JJSJO6,"One Night With The King is a romancified version of the biblical story of Esther who was a young Jewess who ended up being used by God to save the Jews from slaughter when the King was duped to send an edict out commanding the killing of the Hebrews. I don't remember the story well enough to voice how faithfully or not this movie keeps to the biblical account regardless its main concerns are (A) to give a scope to the biblical story and maintain that God working through His faithful people even amidst a hostile culture will save them and (B) to play up the potential of the romance between the King and Esther. The movie succeeds on the first account though the narrative is overly long in achieving its goal; the movie would have been well served by better editing and a reduced run time that would have kept it more focuseddid we really need to see the young boy that Hadassah (who later takes on the name Esther to hide her Jewish roots) would have probably married if the time was different come to her in the palace and tell her that they would still escape to Jerusalem long after she was situated as the queen and he now was a eunuch? I think not. There are several such scenes as these. As to the second point only the first half of the movie builds on the romance with the King and while it handles it without all of the prurient spectacle that a typical Hollywood production would throw at it it is a bit lackluster, a bit played down, in the romance department. Some would say, rightfully so, that the point of the movie is not a romance and thats true but the film puts some effort into trying to generate a romance between Esther and the King. And thats not surprising because he at least certainly fancied her. The first time I saw this I thought it was pretty good, certainly better than I expected it to be, but the second time I guess the flaws of the film showed through. But the heart of the effort was good. 3.5 stars.",1487635200,,1944,4.314207650273224

2673430,4,B000JJSJO6,"Having just preached a 9 week series through Esther someone in my congregation gave me the DVD to watch.  I was impressed that many things were historically accurate.  The movie portrayed the incomplete obedience of Saul slaughter of the Amalekites.  The historical background including Xerxes/Ahasuerus invasion of Greece is quite accurate.  The taking and castration of Esther's boyfriend is not in the Biblical account but according to Herodotus, that was a common practice.  The movie does actually include most of the key elements of the Book.  The Biblical story does not answer all our questions and the movie gives possible answers to questions like, ""how did Esther feel about being taken into the king's harem?""  The movie also suggests why the king chose Esther which is something we don't really know.  It was a little comic at that point; I think Xerxes did have sex with many of the candidates but I wasn't there either.  So the movie adds a lot but to make a film that flows and makes sense as a story to a western audience, it has to.  The major flaw is that especially at the end it turns into a romance novel.  I intend to show it for a movie night at the church and discuss where the movie got it right and where it missed.  The point of the Biblical story is that Esther courageously did what she had to and God did what she couldn't by changing the mind of the king when he couldn't sleep.  So Esther and the Jews were rescued ""by grace through faith"".  A secular historian would call these events coincidence but the Authors (human and divine) of the Biblical story skillful point out the inconspicuous providence of God.  Btw, I'm not Alice.  I'm her husband.",1478822400,,1682,4.631756756756757

2673546,5,B000JJSJO6,One of my favorite biblical movies. Had to get my own copy because my 20 year old granddaughter will not give mine back. Beautiful movie. I'm glad she wanted this instead of  some weird secular movie! It is about how a Jewish girl saves the vast majority of her people. It is found in the Bible in the book of Ester.,1443052800,3,316,4.180327868852459
2673547,5,B000JJSJO6,Wonderfully depicted story of Esther. I have seen the movie several times and always enjoy seeing it again as it shows Esther's strong commitment to her faith.

2673553,5,B000JJSJO6,"The story of Esther is one that has always deeply captivated and fascinated me, and I have to say that this film does a very good, even exceptional, job of bringing it to real life through cinema. It details the lives of two people from very different backgrounds who fall in love with each other despite the tremendous odds against them both and find true happiness in the end -- together.

Does it have some things that were not included in the original Biblical text? Yes, as do most such films. But even so, overall, it manages to masterfully capture and invoke the essence of an ancient story that yet remains relevant and a pillar of both faith and hope to millions of people around the world today. If only the past were a reflection of the future...but then again, it oftentimes is, in ways we do not at first understand.

A fascinating historical and religious movie and one that is highly recommended for just about anyone

I think that my favorite part was when Queen Esther dared to go into the king's court uninvited, knowing that by doing so, he could end her life. It was a very long walk from the entrance of the court all the way down to the king's throne. That was so very well done. I got goosebumps.",1424131200,2,410,4.012195121951219

2673645,3,B000JJSJO6,"OK, nice cultural setting background, but the cultural setting is the message of the movie, eclipsing the faith & deliverance message, and obscuring the reversals of fortune for both the good and the evil.  Way too much improbable syrupy romance angst, probably due to reading modern social values into the ancient setting. The last half of the Biblical story is crammed into the last 1/10th of the movie like it's beside the point. Esther is a story of reversals, and devotes half the story to developing and savoring how the schemers schemes turn around and bite them in the ass, so richly deserved. The signature quote taken from the Biblical text (""If I perish, I perish"") just suddenly makes all that aggrandized movie setting cultural contexting seem drab . Movie not satisfying to one who has read the text many times. My students liked the romance and the eye candy, but the faith, redemption, and salvation threads were totally lost.",1421884800,,942,4.8875

Many religious films are poor productions whereas this film was lavishly produced with beautiful cinematography.
I read the Book of Esther after I watched the film and although there were embellishments to flesh out the story
- remember the Bible was written by male prophets and does not contain all the relationship details women would love to read,  the history
was correctly portrayed. What the film gave me is many hours of entertainment - the exquisite clothing and beautiful sets - and the deep
understanding of how courageous Esther was and how dangerous her petitioning the king was. She was a woman of valor, placed as an
instrument in the hands of God to save her people.  Everyone I've shared the film with has loved it as well.",1420243200,,827,4.657534246575342

2673675,3,B000JJSJO6,"This film was ok as a drama, but I was saddened to read how many viewers thought that this was the biblical story of Esther. I suggest that they read the biblical book. This film was based on the book in the flimsiest manner. Not only did the film makers offer their own imaginative interpretations of events  which is ok as long as one realizes that their imaginative additions are not in the book  but they also distorted the story  and this is not ok, indeed, as I wrote, it misled viewers.
 I will give some examples from the beginning of the film. It states that to understand the story we must realize that when King Saul captured the king and queen of Amalek and let the queen escape, he released a pregnant woman. This happened 500 years earlier. She had a child and for the next 500 years the family decided to avenge what King Saul did to Amalek.  Haman was of this family and even before he rose to prominence, would go out with a gang and kill Jews in Persia. None of this is im the Bible.
 Mordecai, according to the film, was a palace scribe. He kept his religion secret and led people to believe he was a Persian. Xerxes (the name given to Ahasuerus  this point is ok) was preparing to wage war against Greece because of the death of his father Darius. His wife Vashti was anti-war and as a protest staged her own banquet when Xerxes invited people to his banquet. Mordecai attended Xerxes banquet and ate and drank there. Mordecais niece Hadassah wanted to leave Persia and travel to Jerusalem. After much talk, Mordecai allowed her to go, but said he wants to live in Persia. Before she could leave with her boyfriend, Vashti was killed. Mordecai told her that with Vashtis death there will be much turmoil in the land it is not safe to be known as a Jew. He suggested that she act as a non-Jew until she leaves for Jerusalem and not use her Hebrew name Hadassah, but call herself with a Persian name Esther. Before she can leave she is captured and brought to the palace so that Xerxes could find a replacement queen. Xerxes felt he needed a queen in Persia because since he would be gone fighting the Greeks a queen could keep harmony in Persia. Esthers boyfriend is also captured and castrated to make him a eunuch. How did Esther get chosen as queen? Contrary to the Bible, but consistent with The Thousand and One Nights, Esther excites the king by telling him a love story. Esther has a chance to escape Persia with her castrated boyfriend and go to Jerusalem, but now she wants to be with the king. None of this is in the Bible. One can go on and on to show that this is not the biblical story.",1417392000,2,2618,4.352459016393443

2673728,5,B000JJSJO6,"This movie is rated G.  This is a factual movie about Hadassah the young Jewish girl who becomes Esther, a name to hide behind when she is taken to the Palace where she and other girls are readied for their one night with the king.  This is how the King chose his next Queen.  It is not necessarily sexual and in Esther's case she tells him Bible stories and reads to him.  I have rented it several times and decided that  I wanted a copy of my own so I can watch it often. Tifany Dupont as Esther, Luke Goss as  King Xerxes, John Rhys-Davies As Esther's Unlce, John Noble, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif.",1408752000,,604,4.208695652173913
2673729,3,B000JJSJO6,"""One Night With the King"" is a movie that looks like it wanted to be more than it turned out to be. Based on the story of a woman obeying God for the benefit of her people, the Jews, despite the promise of great peril, ""One Night With the King"" misses the mark.

Her story is well-known to any student of ancient literature, CCD or Sunday school. It is up there with Jonah, Noah, Adam and Eve, and the death and resurrection of Jesus. Even agnostics and atheists who are versed in the classics can provide the plot. With this, there are expectations: bring a major story to film and treat it properly.

With lines that come across stiff and stuffy, characters become cartoons, and do not live as real people. How can we believe actors speaking in a mock Shakespearean dialect? I couldn't.

Esther was flirtatious, flighty and yet bold from the first moment. Her character reminded me of Princess Jasmine in Disney's ""Aladdin."" This is not the unassuming future leader we read about, but a different Esther. When the grand decision must be made, she does not struggle in mortal angst as did the biblical version.

The plot itself didn't merit a long movie. A shorter piece, maybe 90 minutes, would have sufficed.

I felt like I was watching ""The Robe,"" in all its effort to send a message, gets lost in a mediocre script.

Esther is a great story in its original form that has incredible big screen potential. Too many liberties were taken, and the production quality was sub-par. It was not a horrible movie, but I won't give it a pass just because I'm a Christian wanting to see biblical stories in film.

2673776,3,B000JJSJO6,"Visually, this movie excels most of the other bible movies done.  The cinematography, the sets, the costumes, and the character of Esther are all stunning.  The acting was okay most of the movie, but there was at least one place where the lines where the annunciation felt unnatural. As someone else mentioned the size of the harem was not realistic, but that is probably the result of a smaller production budget than most Hollywood movies. The main thing that every Hollywood movie production gets wrong when reproducing a bible story is that drastic changes are made to the story which change the power of the original story. This movie is no different because it changes the story in a way that makes role of Providence much less powerful than the original story.
 In the biblical account, Haman, an anti-semite, decides he will go to the King the next day to ask for permission to execute Mordecai, the Jew, but the King as Providence would have it is unable to sleep so he calls for a scribe to read to him.  Again as Providence would have it the book/scroll that the scribe just happens to reads is the chronicled account where Mordecai saved the Kings life by uncovering a plot to kill the King. SPOILER ALERT.... This movie changes the story so that instead of Providence ordering the events of the Kings discovery it is Esther who finds the scroll about Mordecai's heroism and gives it to the King to read... a subtle form of manipulation.
 SPOILER ALERT.... The second thing that bothered me about the movie was the way Esther goes to the King after she has been fasting.  Just because she defied the rule to go before the King uninvited doesn't mean that she defied the rule with an attitude of defiance. It is much more likely that when she came uncalled into the room where the King was at that she would have done it with great humility and respect perhaps with her head bowed down and waiting for the King to extend his scepter.  In this movie she comes barging in and walking all the way up to him before we see him extend the scepter. The way this was done made the scene more dramatic but it seemed a little off to me.
Tiffany Dupont makes a very beautiful Esther, but if you are looking for the most biblically accurate version of the story of Esther I still think the one done with Louise Lombard and F.Murray Abraham is still the best.",1402358400,,2357,4.518779342723005

2673837,3,B000JJSJO6,"The classic Biblical story of the Persian king Xerxes and his wife Esther (respectively Hadassah) told as some kind of soap opera. It is not really bad, it's beautifully shot and entertaining, but was it necessary to tell Esther's story like this?

Ambience, settings and costumes are beautiful to look at, no doubt about that. The historical / Biblical correctness of the content is disputable, including the fact that together with the ""villain"", as is well-known, thousands of his followers including their wives and children were killed and that this now is seen as a reason for rejoicing and celebrating. A fact which is of course not mentioned in this film, because its real purpose is not telling the story of Esther, but eulogizing the ""power of love"".

Esther's characterization rings hollow and all too smooth to me: how many pious women and girls will now see a role model in her, a seeming proof for the idea that virtue and love can solve any problem in the world?
Esther continually speaks of a test she must go through, but we see very early that she has fallen in love with the king. So, her ""test"" means a life in riches and honours by the side of the man she loves. And how did she get his attention? With a trinket she does not own, but which she knows the king likes best from all the pieces of jewellery in his treasure chamber. And how dramatic her legendary entrance before the king: not dressed as a queen the way the Bible says, but drenched in rain and barefoot she appears before him carrying her people's pledge.

It is noticeable that Esther is the true head of state here, not Xerxes, and that she rules a) a weak and insecure king, b) his eunuchs, c) his concubines, whom she treats like some kind of mother hen. Of course she gets her happy ending, how else could it be for a female endowed with so much beauty, goodness and virtue.
Whether this is now the right way to tell a Biblical occurrence everybody must judge for himself. As for me, the lack of realism of this film annoyed me; and in particular, I wouldn't want to know how many pious women and girls will now want to emulate this idealized female figure and become manipulating, vain domestic tyrants. Life is not a fairy tale and not everybody will be enthusiastic about looking up to your ""virtue"" and coming to you for advice about how they have to be.

If you are interested in a convincing - also somehow bombastic, but at least more realistic - telling of this Biblical occurrence, try ""Esther and the King"" from 1960.",1392768000,,2517,4.525274725274725
2673838,2,B000JJSJO6,"We were disappointed that the makers of this video took huge liberties with the Scriptural record, so much so that the story is hardly recognizable in places and laughable in others.

This is a time we must be ready to show the world who we are and what we believe. Esther rose up from miss nobody to safe her nation.  We can do mush more than that but do you know charity begins at home? If Esther had not obeyed her uncle the story would have been different.  Help America by giving your children HOME training. Many people have turned their children to be their gods,  no one can touch them, teachers can not scold them. One family bear a child,  the whole nation trains him. The future of our country lies in the hands of our children. Give them the needed training. Bible says train up a child in the way he should go.

2673865,5,B000JJSJO6,"This is an excellent rendering of the story of Esther with Jewish history. It is filled with passion, some intense scenes that are not appropriate for young children. Love the rich Jewish history, for example, Esther's uncle Mordici, raised her because her parents had died. He had no children and he was a scribe...as a result and because of his teaching and influence, Esther learned to read, something very rare for a woman to do at the time. She then read to the King, and , later,  pretended to read! (But rather re-told) to the King the story in the old testament of how Jacob worked for Laban for 7 years, then 7 more years, for Rachel. Obviuosly, a story she had head countless times from here uncle.

Also, shows how one person can change the course of history; how she was destined for such a time as this. (Think: who is God raising up today, for a bold move in the tomorrow.)

The necklace was not in the Bible accounting but was a nice effect/tool used for the story.

Abusolutely my favorite movie, ever!! Ever.",1389052800,2,1025,4.494623655913978

I love Tommy Tenney's Bible and theology books. He has done a fine job explaining difficult concepts. Therefore, my expectations for this movie were quite high. This movie was a thorough let down.

There is far too much in the way of liberty taken with the Biblical account and historical information,

If you want a good, solid Biblically and historically accurate film, Turner Network Television's ""Bible Collection"" has a far better movie.

2673888,1,B000JJSJO6,"While most movies nowadays based on books such as the Chronicles of Narnia or Lord of the Rings have to take some creative leeway to put it on screen, I believe that this movie distorts not just a book but the very Word of God in its portrayal of the book of Esther.  The extra details that it adds are unnecessary such as her childhood friend who is made a eunech, Haman's blatant attack on Esther towards the end rather than his begging for mercy as in the biblical account, the necklace that in the proper light shines with the Jewish star of David that is nowhere but in this depiction, and I could go on.

2673890,3,B000JJSJO6,"Beautiful sets and costumes. Great performances by some of the actors. My chiefest complaint was that the parts they changed from the Book of Esther made the story bog down. A subplot involving Haman was very convoluted. I thought the Bible verson was not only much clearer but more exciting. For all the money they spent on production, I think more could have been spent on the script.

Also, and here I may be too picky, the use of the Star of David was very important in the movie. The most novice history student knows the Star of David wasn't developed until the Middle Ages. Anachronisms like that make me crazy. I watched the movie once, then gave the DVD away.

2673948,5,B000JJSJO6,"Based on Tommy Tenney's book, I prefer the movie.
The visuals and symbols are wonderful, and the although
the love story between Xerxes and Esther is more fanciful
than the Biblical account, it's worth it.  The scene where
Esther enters the great Hall is moving, and brings
out how she risked her life.  Good acting, wonderful
settings, and I like how they tied the story of Saul into it
at the beginning.  May be a bit mature for children, but
nice for teens and adults.",1374364800,,471,4.517647058823529
2673949,5,B000JJSJO6,"Aghast at some of the 1-star reviews, I had to put my voice in. I read the Book of Esther before watching this movie so I'm well aware of the history. However, when I went into the movie, I realized that the movie may not look like how I see it, after all, it's an ADAPTATION. The personnel put in their own creativity, which adds to the story and emphasizes the points being made.

The main character, Haddassah, is not ""twirling"" all the time, as others have said. (She twirled once.) At first, she mocks the idea of becoming queen. We are given tidbits of wisdom from her, even if she is a teenager. After the Eunich encourages her and she realizes that she stands apart from the others, she rethinks this and this is when she stops ""twirling"". The relationship between the Eunich and Esther is also beautiful and shows that every woman needs a faithful black friend in their life!!!

The movie is peppered with humorous parts (like the nervous suitor puking outside the King's tent) and full of romantic quoteable lines. I like the question that's posed at the very beginning. It's family-friendly. The sex is hinted at but definitely in the background.

My smallest beef is with Luke Goss. At first, I thought they made him look gay. But after having watched it a lot, he grows on you. The fact that they have Caucasian actors also annoyed me until I realized that anthropologically speaking, some in the ancient Persian Empire were Aryan.

This movie is profound and the most maturely romantic movie I've ever seen. It's topped off with a wonderful musical score sung in Farsi, One Night with the King by Shani Rigsbee, which plays during the wedding scene. Although I have no Middle Eastern roots, I watch it every Purim.",1374278400,,1728,4.618892508143323
2673970,5,B000JJSJO6,Very touching and good story. Very close to precise happenings as told in the Bible. I enjoyed it immencely! Would recommend it to those who want to understand more about how God loves and protects His people.,1374192000,,209,4.675675675675675

2673975,3,B000JJSJO6,"I was a little disappointed with the film having read the book. Of course, a book is like getting inside the author's head; a film is an expression of the director's perception of that book so naturally it will be different. However, I did find the performances admirable and the dilemmas faced confronting. Therefore I would recommend the film, but probably only to someone who knew the story of Esther and Mordecai.",1371945600,,417,4.805555555555555
2673976,3,B000JJSJO6,"Although I agree with other reviewers that this newer adaptation of Esther's story takes ""poetic license"" to the extreme (i.e.: she did NOT stand before the King & his court as an improperly dressed, puddled-wet mess), I WILL give it two thumbs up for respecting the Honor & Integrity of both the Bible & this Jewish Queen by upholding her promise to God to KEEP herself as a maid, before marrying Xerxes.

An older film adaptation (entitled ""Esther"") has her character in blatant contradiction to the Bible by sleeping with the King prior to marriage. This did NOT happen, and the inaccuracy severely undermines the Biblical Esther as the Godly representative that she most certainly was, on behalf of both God & Israel!

I also thought the interaction between Esther, the Royal Eunich - and sometimes even Xerxes -  in this adaptation was a bit too ""casual"" at times. Esther was wise, and therefore would have been much more mindful of how she conducted herself in all things, especially in her conversation.  This version sort of ""grew"" on me though, with time.  It's nice to watch with other female pals, or perhaps on a ""movie night"", but actually READING the account in the Bible is far more powerful!!",1371772800,,1208,4.788461538461538

2673978,2,B000JJSJO6,"This film tells of the ""devout Jewish maiden who becomes a queen when she is chosen as the bride of the powerful Persian King Xerxes (Luke Goss). Though hiding her Hebrew identity out of fear for her life, she uses her elevated station to save her people from extermination by dissuading her husband from ordering the slaughter urged by a vengeful court advisor Haman....The deliverance won by Esther's trusting in God is celebrated to this day in the Jewish festival of Purim"" (old(dot)usccb(dot)org/movies/o/onenightwiththeking(dot)shtml).

I have never seen a more handsome and sexy acting, yet very respectable and serious to his role as king.  I wish that he and Esther would have experience more of a passionate role, but being a Biblical story it had to stick more to the bible.  The kings name was different than what is n the bible. I did read the book on Esther before viewing the movie. The woman portraying Esther was also beautiful and did an excellent job.  I must also give  credit to Tony Lister. He was very good.  This is the first time I have seen him in a movie without being a bully,a criminal or stupid acting.  Many thanks to the writer and director for allowing him to act with intelligence and dignity.  I give this movie a 5 because I just think Luke Goss has the most sexiest eyes that was more highlighted in this movies as I ever seen.",1363305600,3,904,4.251461988304094

Esther is portrayed as cheeky to the point of being disrespectful. The king looks like a white guy they put too much bronzer on to make him look middle eastern. Esther's young male friend that she was about to run away with (yay, right) who ends up being castrated is a horrible, horrible plot line. Haman, who would have been dressed regally as one of the king's most trusted officials was dressed like a stragley hoodlum....you get the picture. This was the shallowest, most contrived, most self-important movie about the Bible I have ever seen.

No, Esther did not run through pouring rain, with thin slip-like material turning it into a wet t-shirt perversion.  ""Esther 5:1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes.  She stood in the courtyard of the king's palace, facing his throne room"".  She was not dripping wet.  No, she did not have a boyfriend that is mentioned in the Bible and no she did not dump him because he was turned into a eunuch at the kings palace.

I happen to be participating in a 10 week bible study which is why I decided to watch this movie. Flawed or not I watched the movie for what it is entertainment and companionship to my bible study and it HELPED quite a bit with understanding the things only my heart can see when reading Scripture.

I was always a bit confused with WHY Haman hated dispised the Jews so much but watching this movie and realizing that this story is connected to Saul and Haman emotions stem from his Amalekite heritage in the book of 1 and 11 Samuel. (please feel free to check my reference)

The movie strays so far from the Scriptural account that I almost felt it was blasphemy. Why does the world need another Bible movie that doesn't actually portray the Bible story?  Does this particular Bible story need any help to be intriguing? No.

The actors were completely unconvincing and awkward. The dialogue was inane. It was filmed in India and, curiously, many characters who were supposed to be in Persia had Indian British accents. I thought I was watching and Indian movie and was waiting for the dance scene to erupt.

This movie is an embarrassment. I could not recommend this film. I wouldn't donate one dime to TBN lest it should be wasted on more tripe like this and it is going in the GARBAGE. I would not lend or give this movie to anyone.

The five star reviews must be from people who know the Crouches or who work at TBN. And they absolutely MUST be by people who have never actually read the book of Esther.

I really enjoyed it because it went above and beyond the normal story of Queen Ester. The movie cut out half the book and took out all the violence in an effort to make yet another movie full of good, clean family fun.

However, the costumes and the acting were very good. They should have had more of Peter O'Toole, though. This movie definitely had great potential, especially with Sharif and O'Toole part of the cast. However, by taking out half the book and editing it for content, we loose a lot of the story, and this movie just becomes one of the many Queen Ester movies.",1336176000,2,783,4.4

2674120,4,B000JJSJO6,"One of my favorite stories as a child was that of Esther, the courageous Jewish woman who lived every woman's secret dream... to be taken from obscurity and made a queen of the realm. It was no simple story, for God had intended for her to be put in place for a particular reason. I have often wished that someone would transform this miraculous story into a feature film worthy of praise. Well, someone finally has.

The kingdom of Persia lies beneath the threat of impending war, but unaffected by the decisions of monarchs and princes are the lower class. Hadassah (Tiffany Dupont) is a witty, carefree young woman whose sole desire is to travel to Jerusalem, the land of her fathers. This long is taken every year with the caravans that pass through the magnificent city for trade, and her uncle Mordecai (John Rhys-Davies) has promised that one day she may go. Reluctant to let her go on her own, and unwilling to relinquish his position as a scribe in the king's court, Mordecai can no longer turn down her pleas and agrees that she might go, along with her friend Jesse (Jonah Lotan). Little does he realize that the court of King Xerxes (Luke Goss) is torn with strife and turmoil. Despite knowing that his wife is against the impending battle, the king demands her presence at his banquet.

When Queen Vashti refuses, the king's council Prince Admantha (John Noble) seeks to use her disobedience to his own advantage. Encouraging the king to disown his wife and choose another more worthy woman, he hopes to influence the outcome and hold power in the monarchy. The youngest, most beautiful single women of the realm are removed from their homes and families and taken to the palace, Hadassah among them. Concerned her heritage might place her life in peril, Mordecai encourages Hadassah to embrace the customs of her newfound life. ""Esther"" humbly asks for the guidance of the head eunuch (Tommy Lister) in how best to impress the king, never fathoming that her childish yearnings for greatness are about to come true... There is such a wealth of rich storytelling potential in this scripture passage that I am surprised it has never been explored before, but other recent attempts through television miniseries and specials have nothing in comparison to this exquisitely lavish production.

Christian films have been until now poorly written, badly acted, and cheap in appearance, but One Night With the King dispels all of earlier notions and can compete with the best in secular Hollywood. The costumes are breathtaking. The computer-generated images of Persia are completely realistic. The acting is fabulous, and while the appearances of certain characters do take a little getting used to, the fact remains that it all stands on a very strong script. The best of the novel has been translated to the big screen, with as much drama, potential scandal, and romance as is possible in a two hour film. They did skimp on certain details but overall the story is rich in flavor and true to history. My single complaint would be that at times it is difficult to follow the labyrinth of subplots, particularly those revolving around Prince Admantha. I felt a little lost on several occasions. It's a wonderful film, even if I have to suspend my disbelief that all Esther did in the King's presence was read a scroll...",1332374400,3,3326,4.831578947368421

2674122,4,B000JJSJO6,"While the movie does not strictly follow the Biblical story, it is well done. Hadassah actually falls in love with the King, and he with her. Like a romance novel, misunderstanding mars their way, and it is only at the end, when Hadassah must make her choice that they are reconciled.

The story is more focused on the two of them than it is on the original plot, which plays in the background. I strongly suggest that you read the Scriptural version before watching the movie, then use the movie as a stepping off point for discussions. Particularly, from a feminine point of view, a discussion of being forced into a harem, forced to sleep with a stranger, then assigned to live out your life in this setting would be a good place to start.

There are women today who, like Esther, are faced with this challenge. How does the book of Esther and this movie address this issue for them and for us?",1330387200,,897,4.463414634146342

2674143,2,B000JJSJO6,"I really wanted to like this retelling of the biblical story of Esther but was mostly disappointed.  The casting was spotty, with the accents especially veering all over the map - some sound British, some sound middle Eastern, and one or two sound pretty much Californian!  The direction was a bit of a mess too, with confusing cuts in and out of vital plot line points and weak character introductions and integration.  I watched it with 3 other reasonably intelligent adults (though they might not say the same about me!) and all of us found it a bit tough to follow at times.  It contains most of the major elements of the story of Esther but still manages to make the simple Bible story confusing.  On the plus side, the cinematography was pretty good for a lower budget production and the acting, though inconsistent, was fairly solid overall.  In the end, I would suggest reading the story of Esther rather than watching One Night with The King.

2674147,2,B000JJSJO6,"Shot in 2003 but not released until 2006 and sporting an original title that makes it sound like a tell-all memoir by an Elvis groupie, One Night With the King is a curious beast, a lavishly produced Old Testament epic shot in India by Christian producers with a good eye for visuals, a tin ear for dialogue, a bad memory for what's actually in The Old Testament and a talent for miscasting that sees the film filled with people who either can't act or who act too much. Taking the Book of Esther as its starting point and then running as far away from it in the opposite direction as possible, it's a great story - a woman taken from her family and forced to marry a king but who finds the strength to stay his hand against her people - but you'd never know it from this retelling that seems aimed at teenage girls and the Harlequin/Mills and Boon crowd (indeed, it's adapted from a pulp romantic novel). Curiously for producers who profess their faith and damn Hollywood's dark empire, the script takes more liberties with the scripture than the studios ever did in De Mille's day, not just in an attempt to sanitise it for family viewing (no dallying with concubines or executing former wives for not turning up at feasts here) but with some very ill-advised attempts to string out the drama that simply ends up diminishing the characters as the script gets even more inane. Indeed, words literally fail Esther when she clumsily pleads her case to her sulky husband who has no problem with exterminating the Jews to raise some ready cash. Lucky thing she has a magic necklace to save the day...

At its best the film looks like a lavish live action Disney fairytale with some surprisingly good CGi, but in the hands of the producers behind The Omega Code who served their apprenticeship at the pay-and-pray-and-beg-God-to-kill-your-critics evangelist network TBN, everything else falls flat: like most films made by people who use ""Praise Him"" as a form of punctuation, it's not very good, assuming that hitting you over the head with platitudes and homilies bearing more relation to bad 'love yourself' self-help books than scripture is a substitute for story, character and substance. Esther is so poorly written that it's beyond Tiffany Dupont's limited talents to rise above the script and find a character who could entrance a king: she's more likely to be found in Smallville or the O.C. than Persia. Certainly it seems to be aimed at teenage girls, and not terribly bright ones at that - it's not that the film is patronising, more that it seems to have been made by people who really aren't that bright themselves.

The villains are beyond pantomime, with John Noble's evil plotting courtier vying with James Callis' swastika-sporting anti-Semite for the most over the top performance with such wildly overstated transparent villainy, all mock dramatic deep voices and snarling smiles, that they just have to be sending it all up - badly. Certainly Callis ends up doing what seems like a gravel-voiced sendup of Lord Flashheart from Black Adder II to increasingly laughable effect, but for the most part the film just sports the very worst kind of bad dialogue - not funny, just trite and uninteresting. The love scenes in particular seem to be constructed of non-sequiters haphazardly thrown together, with the actors often behaving in ways that bear no relation to the words coming out of their mouths.

Casting is similarly awkward. Many of the minor supporting cast are simply too obviously Indian to convince as either Persians or Jews, but it's the featured players who are the biggest problem. Prominently billed Peter O'Toole's blink and you'll miss it 75-second cameo as the prophet Samuel is a striking display of inept self-disgust: you can almost hear the mantra of ""I'll kill my bloody agent when I get home"" running through his head as he stands where he's told and runs off the few lines he has as quickly and as angrily as possible so he can get away as fast as he can. Omar Sharif pulls off his rather more substantial supporting role with uninspired professionalism, which is good enough to pass for inspiration in this company, but is bizarrely dubbed by what sounds like a young American making no attempt to disguise his accent in his opening scene before reverting to his own voice. Not that he's the only one who sounds a bit odd - quite what accent Luke Goss' King was trying for is a mystery for the ages. Looking like he's been made up for an amateur production of Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he's so clearly trying his best despite being hopelessly out of his depth that you just end up feeling as sorry for him as you did for Richard Egan in Esther and the King. But the worst is reserved for Tiny Lister as the chief eunuch, who carries much of the film's 'inspiring' dialogue and delivers it like a dyslexic with poor eyesight trying to decipher a dead language from badly scribbled cue cards. Only John Rhys Davies really shines in the cast with a performance that's miraculously immune to the general inadequacy that surrounds him, like a diamond in a dunghill.

2674153,4,B000JJSJO6,"It will probably be more difficult for those viewers who consciously or unconsciously compare this movie with the Biblical Book of Esther to enjoy the love story presented. As a stand-alone love story it has drama and beauty, it really makes no serious attempt to be a movie version of the Book of Esther.

True, many elements of the Biblical Esther are there, but they are freely enhanced by the imaginations of those involved in writing the screenplay. If the viewer can set aside the Biblical Esther and accept the premises of the movie, viewing it can be an enjoyable time. At times the movie can be hard to follow and seems to jump around a bit; if one can overlook these moments and just move on with the flow of the movie those interludes are tolerable.

Tiffany Dupont does bring a youthful, enthusiastic and tender Esther to the screen whose beauty leaves little question about the king's choice of her to be his next queen. Luke Goss plays King Xerxes as a more sensitive soul pressured by circumstances but responding with balance. The other supporting roles are well cast and acted by very capable actors so there is no shortage of convincing performances.

If one views the movie with an open mind and specifically avoids direct comparison with the Book of Esther one should find it a reasonably enjoyable experience. I have not read the book ""Hadassah"" by Tommy Tenney from which the movie is taken, so I cannot make any comparisons there.",1296777600,4,1453,4.71259842519685

The acting is lousy.  The actors seemed so unsure of themselves that they mumbled the entire time!  So I assume the director must have been MIA or lousy, too.  And the editing is the worst of all.  A few scenes that needed that ""fade to black"" moment rushed right into the next scene, while others dragged.  Some dramatic moments were lost because of this.  I feel like the whole thing was rushed in the making.  And it seems like the entire budget was spent on beautiful sets, when more of it should have been allotted to everywhere else.",1296604800,3,712,4.465116279069767

2674166,4,B000JJSJO6,"A very Romantic retelling of the Biblical story of Esther. An attempt to bring back the great old genre of Bible epics like ""The Ten Commandments.""  Great, well-known actors are enlisted in the effort:  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, John Rhys-Davies, John Noble.  Be forewarned that O'Toole's appearance is very brief.  The more extensive roles of the other three actors are excellently acted.  For me, the not well-known Luke Goss was just right and very attractive as King Xerxes.  He had great charisma in the part.  The unknown Tiffany Dupont as Esther was, in my view, just ""good.""  Not superb. I loved Tommy Lister as Hegai, Esther's eunuch mentor and friend; was glad the movie-makers extended that part and made it important throughout much of the story.  The sets, costumes, and music supported the ""epic spectacle"" very beautifully.  I did take exception to the hair-do and costume that Esther wore in her first official night with the king, and in the scene where she enters the throne room against protocol.  I think the costumers meant for her to appear attractive in a plain and simple way, but, instead, she just looked odd because of the peculiar cut of the dress. The set of the palace, according to a program I saw on TV, was that of an actual palace in India, although some views of it must have been computer-generated. The waterfall walls of the computer-made palace were unique and striking.  The throne room of Xerxes was spectacular with those huge, rampant lions which seemed to echo the king's physique.  (Or did he echo theirs?)

The scene where Esther enters the throne room against protocol, for which she can be killed, is extra dramatic, terrific!

The movie adheres rather closely to the Biblical story except for using the dramatic device of a special holographic Star-of-David necklace cherished by Esther as a childhood gift from her parents.  It figures crucially in the plot and in Esther's destiny.  I liked this innovation, and didn't mind this tinkering with the basic story since it didn't change any of the essential meaning of Esther's history.

In order to serve the basic meaning of Esther's destiny, the movie should have established a stronger connection between Esther and the Jewish people, and it should have established a stronger connection between Esther and God.

The message of the film was chiefly that Esther was chosen for a special destiny, that of saving the Jewish people, but that she also had to make a choice of her own will in order to take on her destiny.  As the choice involved the possible loss of her life, it took great faith and courage.  Having viewed a lot of the promotion for the movie, I know that the movie producers hoped to imply that all people have special destinies and must make courageous choices, however insignificant may be the circumstances of their lives.

I may be wrong, but I had the feeling in 2 or 3 scenes that the movie-makers were copying aspects of The Lord of the Rings films, and I did not like them to do that.",1296259200,2,3010,4.77027027027027

The film was so inaccurate not only in its depiction of the main characters but also in the story line itself. The overall acting was only mediocre. Esther in real life was not a giddy, happy-go-lucky free spirit but a serious and mature young woman. The depiction of Mordecai was even more ridiculous. Instead of showing him as an active, important advisor to King Ahasuerus, he is portrayed as an outsider. The same goes for Haman who is incorrectly portrayed as an instigator stirring up the masses against the Jews instead of doing it quietly and deceitfully behind the scenes.

The 1999 film ""Esther"" is light years ahead of this film in every aspect, especially biblical and historical accuracy. Plus, the acting is superb. It is so sad when film makers can't product an accurate rendition of a biblical story. Then again, that is par for the course for Hollywood!",1287619200,6,1128,4.663316582914573

It has several known stars who help to ""make"" the movie. The scenery is fantastic as are the sets and wardrobes. There are a couple of characters that are hard to understand in the pronunciation of some words in their dialogue -- hence watching it again to see if we could catch what they said and/or meant. It did not detrack at all from the movie, however. There is the sensitive issue of the royal eunuch but it is not dwelled on but only mentioned. They do not show violence but only imply violent outcomes. It, also, shows the belief of prayer combined with fasting to overcome evil by soliciting the help of God. I feel that this is a movie the whole family can enjoy.

2674227,1,B000JJSJO6,"I had very low expectations of this film, and the film did not live up to them.  How this film has garnered an average of 4 stars from Amazon viewers is beyond me.  The producers, director, and presumably the writers of the novel on which this book is based have absolutely botched it.  It's such a waste of a profound and beloved Biblical story.

My main complaint is that Esther's true character doesn't get a look in here.  Tiffany Dupont is woefully miscast.  A nasally American voice and a modern sensibility overwrite the gravity of her situation and Esther's unusual integrity and presence of mind.  I couldn't help feeling like I was watching an incarnation of Disney's Princess Yasmin.  She giggled like a schoolgirl throughout, and when brought to the harem along with all of half a dozen other beautiful virgins (seriously? That was all they could find? In all the provinces of the realm? It was a pretty big realm!) she spent a lot of time twirling under invisible showers of rose petals and not a lot of time contemplating her fate, which should have been pretty sobering.  I do not think these are the qualities that impressed Hegai the King's eunuch, or led her to ""win the favour of everyone who saw her"".  In short, she wasn't queen-like.  What a waste of an opportunity to portray a dignified Jewish woman.

In the film, she meets Xerxes weeks before their official first meeting.  It's love at first sight, obviously.  He asks her to read to him, and she diverts from the text to tell a story about Jacob and Rachael, a story which probably would have been a dead give away to anyone remotely acquainted with Jewish history - not a smart move considering she's concealing her cultural identity.  But Xerxes finds it charming and falls in love with her.  Turns out he's a pretty sensitive guy.  Their relationship is Hollywood standard complete with an emotional proposal of marriage, lots of talk about stars and jewels and plenty of tears and hugs.  There's even a lover's spat in which Xerxes spots Esther walking through the ""lover's gate"" with the elderly Mordecai and assumes she's having an affair (what the...?!?).  Rather than having her killed on the spot for infidelity and treason, Xerxes mopes around the palace for a days eating chocolates and watching romance movies (I presume).  Unfortunately this entirely fictionalised episode overshadows the rest of the film, as the producers use the lovers' frustrations with each other to add drama to the rest of the story, which DOESN'T NEED IT.  I'm not sure why any of these diversions from the true story are necessary.  They undermine it.

The climax of the story is of course the moment when Esther risks her life by confronting Xerxes in the great hall.  In the Biblical account, she puts on her royal robes and stands boldly in the entrance.  Xerxes extends his gold scepter to her, thus sparing her life, and before she evens speaks, promises to grant anything she wishes, even up to half his kingdom.  In other words, he's offering to let her share his reign.  Of course she humbly invites him to a banquet and ultimately requests the salvation of the Jewish people, thus achieving immortality as one of the most heroic women, and one of the most heroic Jews, in history.

In the film, there are no Royal robes, and she actually runs through the rain in a beige dress, with no shoes on (?), and charges into the great hall looking like a (very pretty) drowned rat.  Xerxes still thinks she's having an affair at this point, so he's none to pleased to see her, although at the last moment he relents and stops a nearby eunuch from beheading her with a scythe.  Shortly thereafter she faints, which is just an insult and a shameful liberty to take with the story.  The book of Esther remembers her as a courageous, articulate woman who was absolutely measured and determined in her approach.  Xerxes virtually recognised her as an equal, so she must have been pretty self-possessed.  I'm exasperated that the filmmakers have reduced her to a mere puddle of a woman - an hysterical Victorian sterotype.

Luke Goss makes a banal, if physically appropriate King Xerxes.  A little too heavy on the eyeliner though, and I'm not sure it was necessary to be shirtless approximately half the time.  I guess when the makeup artists spend so long slathering him in fake tan, it would be a shame not to show it off at every available opportunity.  I suspect his teeth were bleached to glow-in-the-dark proportions for the same reason (ie., to emphasise the tan).  He's not very authoritative, and not very interesting.

There were too many anachronisms and inaccuracies.  Hegai had an unusually deep voice for a eunuch, and didn't appear suited to coordinating beauty treatments and accessories.  Haman orates like Hitler and the film even appropriates a swastika for his own personal logo.  Esther has a boyfriend prior to being drafted as a concubine.  Coincidentally, he is recruited as a Eunuch in the palace, which makes for some unintentionally comic scenes as he pleads with her to run away with him (post-operatively).

John Rhys-Davis makes an excellent Mordecai - my only regret is that they didn't make enough room for him in what is essentially an insipid Hollywood love story. John Noble also put in a good performance.  The props and sets were beautiful and seamless, and the costumes were exquisite. They must have made extensive use of CGI technology, but it wasn't obvious.

If you love the story of Esther, run - don't walk - away from this abysmal trainwreck of a movie. I can guarantee that the Biblical account alone is infinitely richer.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Hollywood should not be trusted with Biblical accounts.",1273363200,92,5731,4.771573604060913

2674236,1,B000JJSJO6,"I saw the trailers for this and was impressed.  A new movie about Esther?  Well, surely that ought to be interesting.
People familiar with the book, Esther, of the Bible will know the basic plot of this book.  King Xerxes of Persia looks for a new queen.  Esther is one of the many chosen to present herself in One Night with the King.  Will he accept her as queen?  And what can a Jewish woman do in this position?
Although there was much I despised, I did enjoy the performances of the eunuch and John Rhys Davies.  I could associate with both characters and felt each did a good job with his material.
As for the rest of the film, there is so much to dislike, I had to put it in list form:
1.  Tiffany Dupont.  Honestly, her interpretation of Esther was poor.  She acts far too modern, far too childish for her own good, far too ""goody-too-shoes"".  Women of this time don't campaign to leave by themselves for another country.  I doubt Esther would be able to read; most women of this day weren't taught how to read (most men couldn't read).
2.  The entire story of Esther is skewed.  Suddenly, the story of Esther has a war, a campaign against Greeks and democracy, many new characters (Jesse and Admantha), scenes were Esther reads to Xerxes before her Night.  I can understand that some liberties will be taken, but the war is completely unnecessary and silly.  I have no idea why the Greeks and democracy angle must be thrown in.
3.  The mysterious pendant.  Really, what is the point of this?  Talk about taking credit away from God and placing it in an inanimate object.
4.  Melodramatic music.  Need I say anymore?  It ranges from goofy little melodies to over-pompous ""Battle themes"".
5.  Modern views of marriage and love.  Love and marriage as we know it didn't exist back then.  People back in that day regularly married for money or because of arrangements and very rarely for love.  Why must movies, specifically this one, cheapen the story by inserting reciprocated love and traditional marriage?  Also, it isn't made clear in the movie, but each woman had ""One Night with the King"" so the King may have his way with her, not for her to show off some talent of hers.  Then, the women would be placed in the harem, never to see the King again unless he called for her.
6.  Costumes. They look really cool, but are they really Persian?  Half the time, I feel they appear more Indian than Middle Eastern.
7.  The actor chosen to be Xerxes is really bland and boring as mud.
All in all, the people who would like this movie most would be the ones who will see how far the story veers from the one in the Bible and be turned off.  Other people, who don't know the Biblical story of Esther, won't be interested in the poor casting, acting, costumes, script, and music.  Honestly, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  The best quote in the movie, and the best quote to describe this movie, is one spoken by Haman: ""Never have I heard a more pathetic story in my entire life!""

2674237,4,B000JJSJO6,This movie is based on the story of Esther from the Bible. It does not follow the scripture entirely but all the necessary components are there and the history is accurate. Well done and I would consider this an entertaining as well as informative movie for mixed company.,1260230400,,272,4.6875
2674238,4,B000JJSJO6,"This follows the Bible story closely in the major facts but the ""embelishments"" are not Bibical. One does well to read the book first then this adds a beautiful picture in ones mind of the characters and the Palace.

I enjoyed it very much. Doing a Beth Moore Bible Study and watched this again just to have the visuals to go with the deep study of the book.

Highly recommend to those who enjoy Bible film, especially Jewish settigs.",1251763200,,434,4.481012658227848
2674239,2,B000JJSJO6,"Not a very acurate account of the Biblical story of Esther.  If the screen play writer had used the facts, the movie would have been much more interesting.  King Xerxes was portrayed as sympathetic and caring.  He was just the opposite, self absorbed and out of touch with his kingdom.  Esther had 2 banquets for the King before making her request known and she did not run in the rain, looking haggard to see the king.  She was dressed in her finest gown after 3 days of fasting and came before the throne, beautiful, yet unannounced.  The movie length was fine and for entertainment purposes, it was worth my time. Just don't go in thinking it will be much like the Biblical account.",1251504000,4,685,4.528455284552845
2674240,1,B000JJSJO6,"Perusing the user reviews of this terrible film,  I see that it pleased the great majority of those who took the time to write.

Dear reader, be warned. It's a childish,  trite,  terribly acted mishmash. The girl who plays Esther can barely say her lines,  and she is not always understandable (she is cute,  however,  in that prom-queen way).  And as bad acting goes she's not the worst of the lot (Xerxes is).

On the other hand,  it appears to have cost a pile of money to make, and one can pass an idle evening before one's TV screen watching the images flicker by.  If you know your Bible, , you can be amused by the tinselly treatment of the subject,  admittedly a very powerful one.  Just don't expect a great deal of substance:  you can't get filet mignon at MacDonald's.",1250380800,18,779,4.432624113475177
2674241,4,B000JJSJO6,This movie does not claim to be fact.  It was made purely for entertainment.  How many movies are worth watching today?  Not many.  This was worth watching.  I enjoyed it and so did my 15yr old son.  He is a real critic.  Acting was just fine.  It is based on the story of Ester.,1248912000,,279,4.037037037037037
2674242,1,B000JJSJO6,"Watched this movie thinking it would be an accurate portrayal of the story of Esther....it isn't; the acting is worse than second rate, stiff, unbelievable.  The costumes are laughable and the mysticism surrounding Esther's necklace, ridiculous. This film is a disservice to a Biblical story that is so rich and which has all the elements to make a fantastic movie from many perspectives, historical, romantic, spiritual....do not waste your money on this DVD, read the Bible account, IT IS BY FAR MORE EXCITING!",1247702400,17,512,5.168674698795181
2674253,2,B000JJSJO6,"If your looking to get the true story of Esther, look to the Bible not in this movie.  Although the acting and filming were done well, the movie just took too much liberty with the story.  I guess nothing can compare with the real thing! Watch the movie, but be sure and read the Biblical account first.",1247184000,3,303,4.298245614035087
2674254,5,B000JJSJO6,"this movie was very close to being an accurate biblical account, but what wasn't there was not really that important. It gave the overall picture of Esther and the call God put on her life. It was very helpful in understanding how the Jews had been assimilated into the culture through all the years.  Overall, it was very enjoyable.",1247097600,,333,4.6440677966101696
2674255,5,B000JJSJO6,"I loved the movie; It's a fresh look at one of the BIble's more overlooked stories, and it's shockingly Biblical in content. It really gave me a visual concept of the story of Esther.",1245888000,,183,4.411764705882353
2674256,3,B000JJSJO6,the movie was entertaining and had lots of cinematic support.  but it is not as accurate as careful study of esther will reveal.,1245715200,,128,4.565217391304348
2674257,4,B000JJSJO6,"One of my favorite books in the bible is Esther because it deals with the Jews in the Persian Empire. This movie expands the plot with extra dialog and has very rich costumes and scenes.
The Hebrews were a subject people that in many cases mean they were slaves
with little or now rights. This movie makes Haman into a Persian Hitler
whose conspiracy to kill all the Jews fails. That Jews have not been a ""beloved"" people in the empires that conquered them is no historical
secret: it is the subject of novels and much of their history past the bible as well. The major problem seems that the virtues attached to Jews living their faith make them prosperous even when others around them are failing. I liked the movie, but the building although maybe Persian or at least Islamic are all of a latter architecture than that of about 300 b.c.
Domes that weren't built until the 13th century a.d. are part of the skyline.",1245628800,,917,4.497005988023952
2674258,2,B000JJSJO6,"I do not write Amazon reviews very often. In fact this is just my second review in almost 10 years of being a happy Amazon customer.
This movie is based on the novel ""Hadassah"" by Tommy Tenney. The only thing I liked was the presence of actors such as Omar Sharif and the wonderful Peter O'toole. But as other reviewers have noted the presence of big names does not make a good movie.
They dressed Tiffany Dupont in really beautiful, gorgeous, lavish gowns even tough I think they are not authentic for that time period.
Luke Goss as King Xerxes... Oh, my God his acting is horrible, just plain awful.

There was no need to add or to take away from the real story... It's just good the way God wrote it in the Bible. But then again, this movie is based on a novel not the book of Esther in the Bible. This movie is not worth keeping, I'm giving my copy away. It really deserves one star but I'm rating it with two stars just for Peter O'toole (even though he is in the movie only for a few seconds) and Omar Sharif.
Do not buy this movie.... just rent it.",1244937600,2,1055,4.197044334975369
2674259,5,B000JJSJO6,one night with the king is based on the book of Esther in the Bible. It was true to form. We were studying this book in the Bible and it really helped us to understand it. The dvd was clear and just like being in the movie theater. Amazon has the best prices on dvd's and I have always been very pleased with the quality of the films.,1244764800,,334,3.926470588235294
2674260,5,B000JJSJO6,This is the second time I've purchased this movie. I left the first copy at the prison where I was a chaplain for the inmates to enjoy. I love the way it sticks closely to the Old Testament account of Esther's story. I'm passing this one around to my church friends as well.,1244073600,,274,4.188679245283019
2674261,5,B000JJSJO6,"I loved this movie and think that it's actually pretty accurate to the biblical version(which I just read a minute ago), now, hopefully I can find the book that is based on the movie.

Esther is my absolute favorite bibilical story of all time!!!!",1242259200,,247,4.613636363636363
2674262,5,B000JJSJO6,"Beautifully done.  The movie comes alive with breath taking scenery, exquisite costumes and actors who take you back in time to a place where the greatest love story ever told unfolds.",1241913600,,184,4.935483870967742
2674263,2,B000JJSJO6,"I relish in movies based on the Bible that are both true to scripture and historically accurate.  The good news is that this movie was, for the most part, was in accord with the Old Testament Book of Esther; however, the production itself was more of a Hollywood extravaganza than one that accurately depicted the dress and lifestyles of the historical period.  The King looked as if he was ""in drag"".  Perhaps my grandchildren best described it by saying it was ""cheesy"".  My wife did like it, so maybe part of my reaction is just a guy thing.",1240704000,2,544,4.520408163265306
2674264,5,B000JJSJO6,We had studied Esther and the risks she took for her people in Sunday School and I wanted to know more about her. Someone in the class said they has heard of this movie so I searched Amazon for it. Of course I found it and purchase it. I thought is was such a wonderful story of a womans life and belief. I say story but I know it was true. I have watched it three times and will probably watch it more.,1237334400,,403,3.8674698795180724
2674265,5,B000JJSJO6,"REALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE BOOK OF ESTHER ITS BEATIFUL, we thought long and hard, it's nice to have IN OUR LIBRARY FOR OUR CHILDREN to see.",1237248000,,134,4.4
2674266,5,B000JJSJO6,"I must agree with other reviewers of this movie.  While some liberties were taken, they are not enough to detract from the beautiful story as it is told in the Bible.  I love the majestic feel of the movie--at some points, my heart swells with joy; at others, I want to bow in humility at the greatness of God and the knowledge that He holds our times in His loving hands.  This movie makes me appreciate the Bible account even more.  And as for its success as a movie, I think my 13-yr-old daughter said it best.  As the movie ended, she looked over at me, sighed, and said, ""This beats Cinderella any day.""  So true.",1235865600,,618,4.2844827586206895
2674267,5,B000JJSJO6,"This is one of my favorite versions, of the book of Esther thats in the Bible. I loved it! It is about a beautiful jew who caught the eye, and heart of a king.

 Esther, and her honorable kinsmen Mordeci lived in the kings kingdom, except Esther and Mordeci was jews! You will see how being a jew caused trouble for them, and how God helped the jewish people through Esther. It is a true, awesome story!

But first ,read the book of Esther thats in the Bible, it will give you God's true account, and version of this remarkable story! It is a awesome, true story of the Bible!

 In the movie, I loved the beautiful colors, and the flowers, and the beautiful, colorful clothes, and of course, the handsome king, and the beautiful Esther! Esther and the king, is one of my favorite love storys from the Bible!",1235606400,,807,4.3533333333333335
2674268,1,B000JJSJO6,"Sold to us as a story from the Bible... NOT EVEN CLOSE! The story isn't very well written, just read the book of Esther it's much more interesting!!!!",1235520000,,150,4.392857142857143
2674269,5,B000JJSJO6,I am presently teaching a Bible Study on the Book of Esther.  This movie fits so perfectly with this study.  Very well done and so very accurate!,1235433600,,145,4.333333333333333
2674270,5,B000JJSJO6,"This IS about the book of Esther.

I loved this movie so much, I saw it four times!!!!

It was the most beautiful love story I have ever seen in the biblical times and it goes to show that true love can exist no matter what.

I was captivated by the retelling of this story.

Usually when you think of bible stories you get see Charles Heston (may he rest in peace) standing on a mountain with gray hair and lightning behind him.

And you always think that there was a lot of suffering and ugliness, but this one was different.

True there was suffering. Don't all love stories have this going on?

But there was so much wonderfulness about this movie that I highly recommend it to all to see.

I can say (if you have never) One Night With The King makes you almost want to spend one night with your bible to read the story from Esther.",1233792000,2,836,4.18125
2674271,3,B000JJSJO6,"This movie is a good film, but I was disappointed with the way it did not follow the bible.",1232928000,,91,3.8421052631578947
2674272,5,B000JJSJO6,What a great movie.  It took us back to the time of Esther and how she allowed God to use her to help a nation even at the possibly cost of her own life.  A tastefully done love story too.  Wonderfully done!!,1232841600,,208,3.9047619047619047
2674283,5,B000JJSJO6,"I highly enjoyed this version of the Esther story. I felt the acting was pretty well done and the costumes and sets are breathtaking. Sure it wasn't 100% accurate, but that didn't take away from the essence of the story. One woman who was destined to save the Jewish race from annhilation at the hands of one man. It's also a love story, but it's different from the ones we're used to.

This movie is fun to watch, even if there are mistakes, like in the ending scenes, but that doesn't take away from the story itself. I also liked that some history was added that's not normally put into the story, the side story of the Greeks(which was funny because I had just finished watching 300 right before this) and it helped to set the story a bit.

It's also a family movie. It has something to take away from it. You can just be one person and do great things.",1232582400,,857,4.283950617283951
2674284,5,B000JJSJO6,"I've watched this movie over a year ago, and ordered it from Amazon (which I haven't had the time to open yet). This is a beautiful movie, I only hope this DVD has no flaws.",1232236800,,173,3.9714285714285715
2674285,5,B000JJSJO6,"Enjoyed this very much.  Great sets/visuals.  John Rhys-Davies played Mordecai, Luke Goss (Hellboy II) played King Xerxes, and Omar Sharif played a prince.",1230768000,,155,5.695652173913044
2674286,5,B000JJSJO6,"This movie is an awesome addition to current biblical dramas. The story holds closely true to scripture, and characters are largely both likeable and believable. Cinematography is beautiful and riveting with elaborate settings and location. While not scripturally verbatim the story remains beautiful and engaging.",1229731200,,314,6.0
2674287,5,B000JJSJO6,"One Night with the King is a fabulous theatrical presentation of the story of Esther. Although some ""creative liberties"" were taken in the making of the movie, the core of the story follows the true Biblical version quite well. An excellent pick for a night with the girls. You won't be disappointed.",1228176000,,300,4.788461538461538
2674288,1,B000JJSJO6,"I never received my DVD from the seller.  They did not answer most of my requests for information, and did not offer me a refund.  I'm not happy :-(.",1223510400,,149,4.103448275862069
2674289,5,B000JJSJO6,This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The Product was delivered way before the time it was supposed to be shipped. No problems with the product at all.,1223337600,,172,4.242424242424242
2674290,2,B000JJSJO6,"I saw this movie in the theaters. I was drawn to it because I had fallen completely inlove with the book. <Esther has always been one of my favorite Bible stories and I loved the way that Tenney had taken it, and combined with history's Xerses, whom Biblical historians believe was Esther's Xerses. He added a few fictional characters for the the flow, and I believe it was outstanding!>
The movie was hardly anthing like the book itself. It even added a little 'magic' in the film when only those who had God could see the stars that Esther's necklace gave out.
Perhaps if I had not read the novel, and was moved my 'enchantment' in a 'non-enchantment' movie, I would have liked it.
That is truthfully all that was wrong in my eyes: Hardly anything like the book, and no part of 'fantasy' belonged in this kind of story.
If you haven't read the book, I will admit that you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are fan of the book, the movie just kills it to me!",1223337600,,963,4.355555555555555
2674291,4,B000JJSJO6,"I have to admit I had to watch this movie no less than 3 times before it grew on me. Like so many people, I had a problem with it's lack of biblical accuracy. Eventually, I came to love this movie despite its flaws. It's now one of my favorite biblical movies and reminds me of the best biblical movie of all times, Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"". Another movie lacking in biblical accuracy but still visually stunning and well acted. As is this movie. With all the movies out there containing profanity and sex, this movie is truly a breath of fresh air. This one is sure to become a classic.",1223337600,,604,4.353982300884955
2674292,5,B000JJSJO6,This movie brings back memories of Cecil b deMilles epic dramas from days gone by . Excellent in all facets and scriptually sound wit a Hollywoosd blast. Highly recommend,1222905600,3,170,4.896551724137931
2674303,5,B000JJSJO6,I am so glad I bought this movie.  It has become one of my favorites.,1222128000,,69,3.6
2674304,5,B000JJSJO6,"What a great movie and wonderful tribute to Esther!  Though it is not 100% accurate with the Bible's account (and not expected for an hour and a half movie!), it is still a Biblically based, well-dramatized depiction of her and Israel's story.",1220659200,,243,4.785714285714286
2674305,1,B000JJSJO6,This movie failed on almost every level to deliver entertainment.  Painful to watch with terrible dialog and amateurish directing.  This movie could have been so much better and it's a shame more of the Biblical story did not shine through with so much creative license taken.,1220486400,,276,4.978260869565218
2674306,5,B000JJSJO6,"I love history, so the ancient times have always intrigue me.  I believe this give a close maybe not exact account that is in the Bible but the meaning is there.  I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it.  It's outstanding!",1218499200,,236,4.441860465116279

2674308,5,B000JJSJO6,"THE MOVIE FLOATED TO FAR AWAY FROM THE BIBLICAL MEANING AND ADDED TO MUCH FANTASY AND IMAGINATION.

 ALMOST appeared mystical which is a big turn off for followers of the G_d's true word.

 Example: What was the deal with the Crystal that made the Star of David Illuminated  all over the walls of her house, I didn't read that part in the Torah/Bible!!!!!

Nice try though and I guess its better than watching Harry Potter",1217635200,,422,4.56

2674310,2,B000JJSJO6,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but was disappointed as much fiction was added to what already would have been a better story.

The cinematography is beautiful but the acting and especially the screenplay were disappointing.  Some of the ridiculous elements added include a magic crystal necklace and a boyfriend who gets made into a eunuch.

A much better movie of the Esther story is ""Esther"" made in 1999 starring Louise Lombard and F. Murray Abraham.",1217376000,2,472,4.949367088607595

I'm obsessed with wanting to play the character of Esther in a major Hollywood film with the calibur/budget of that of Lord of the Rings... either her, or I'd like to play Ruth in a LR Trilogy of Ruth, David & Solomon.

That said: I had high hopes for this film, but I mean... it does drag on.. as a girl, I have to say, some of the outfits are quite cute, and I'd love to wear them.. .the message? Well, they adlib some things, like some guy friend of Esther having a crush on her.. I don't recall reading that in the Biblical account...I think it could've done w/out that.. and various other  ""not in the Bible"" things... I don't care for those parts.. I love the story of Esther no matter what, so I'll watch this film over and over again, but my friend came over and I wanted her to watch it, and she fell asleep, so there you go.

2674320,5,B000JJSJO6,"""One Night With the King"" is a fantastic piece of historical fiction. It clearly presents two major Biblical themes: 1) God saves His people, 2) God's people need a mediator. Not only is the story of Esther told, but other parts of Scripture are worked in (several Psalms, Proverbs, and bits of Isaiah and 1 Samuel are featured) as well as a few of the historical and political circumstances.
The major weaknesses of the film are: 1) it's over-emphasis of anachronistic political concepts (the Persians were not really worried about a conspiracy of Jews and Greeks establishing a democracy in the Middle East); and 2) the emotional/chick-flic aspects that break through occasionally (the Persian king cries far to much for someone who's supposed to be the most powerful man in the world).",1208217600,,788,4.9772727272727275
2674321,3,B000JJSJO6,"So... I wish this had a 2.5 star option...
This movie is not very accurate when it's compared to the story in the Bible.  One thing that bugged me was that in the Bible, Esther finds favor with the king early on- in the movie she's walking on eggshells the whole time around him.  Also- what is going on with that psychedelic necklace??  LOL- where did that idea come from?!
With that being said... I like chick flicks as much as anyone... and (with the historical inaccuracies aside) this film is ULTRA cheesy.  ""Cheese-fest"" was how my husband described it... so watch with caution.",1207699200,3,584,4.586538461538462

I have since then watched the rest and have found more issues, but I will not get into those reasons here. My criticisms stand the same.

Good:
1. The cinematography, although not really on-par with most Hollywood films, was better than most Christian films.
2. The acting was fairly good on many levels.

Now I want to get into the problems. I will not discuss the technical aspects of how the film was made, but in the short amount of the film I watched, there were a great number of Biblical, cultural, and historical inaccuracies within the movie. Some of these may not seem like a big deal, but to those of us who have studied such topics, it makes all the difference in the world.

1. The environment of what was supposed to be Persia was poorly researched. Yes, I know the movie was filmed in India. But Persian clothing, buildings, etc. are far different from that of India.
2. The movie portrayed Esther and Mordecai as good Jews that wanted to return to the promised land, but could not. Yet it was not long before that the King of Persia (whose name I cannot remember off of the top of my head) allowed any and all Jews to return to the promised land as they wished. If Esther and Mordecai were still there even years after the decree, they clearly did not have a desire to return to the promised land after all, showing that they did not care much about their faith.
3. The necklace that Esther had showed the Star of David, a Jewish symbol that did not even come into being until after the time of Christ.
4. The group that Haman was involved in had as their symbol what was essentially a stylized swastika. That is beyond ridiculous.
5. The way that people dressed was certainly far off. In the movie, Esther wore a number of different colored dresses, seemingly one for every scene. If they were supposed to be poor, it is no wonder! Colored fabric was so expensive to make that even royalty rarely had more than a few outfits! And even royalty rarely wore more than one outfit until the clothing literally would fall off. Besides, there were no dresses, let alone dresses that showed off so much skin!
6. The movie had Mordecai saying that Esther was a ""good Babylonian name,"" but they were in Persia, not Babylon.
7. The movie basically gave Esther a guy who was interested in her. That is certainly a stretch, especially in terms of having the kind of relationship which she had with him, which would not have occurred at all.
8. In the movie, Esther acted like one of those modern-day-trying-to-be-cute-by-pretending-to-be-childish girls. Though Esther was young, there is absolutely no reason to believe that kind of attitude would ever be seen in a Jewish girl her age. That would have brought dishonor to her uncle and she probably would have been stoned for such things.
9. The movie portrayed Xerxes as a wussy gentlemanly-type. While he would not have been viewed as deity or had a bunch of piercings like in the movie 300, he was definitely more of a King than a pansy.
10. The movie portrayed Esther and the other girls as being forced to go to Xerxes, but the reality is that all of the girls who went made the choice to go.
11. The movie basically had Xerxes choosing Esther because she read well, was pretty, etc. The reality of the matter is that it was not a beauty contest. Xerxes slept with every one of those women, and Esther was chosen on that basis. It is historically true, whether we like it or not. Yes, it is sad that Esther would do such a thing in order to save her people, but it is what happened.

Now I know my review is not going to be popular for those who like this movie. But I want to make something clear: the Biblical Esther did do a great thing for her people. How she got to the position where she did was certainly not the type of thing a woman of God should have done, but it happened nonetheless. She was a woman of courage, and in the end did what she believed had to be done. She was a true testament to how God can use anyone, even in the midst of poor decisions, to accomplish His purposes.

This movie, however, failed in just about every aspect that it could in my mind. It is a shame that a movie that otherwise was reasonable had to be so far-off Biblically, historically, and culturally. I only mentioned a few of the things that I noticed in the portion of the movie I saw, but there are certainly more problems than I could name without writing a ton more. So do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. No matter how ""enjoyable"" it may seem, any movie that is based on a Biblical story needs to be as accurate as it can be. Otherwise, all it does is give completely false ideas to people of what is true.",1206921600,8,4837,4.35809312638581
2674334,5,B000JJSJO6,This is a very good movie - while I was impressed with everyone's acting - it was Luke Goss that made the picture!  His sensitivity and compassion to Esther and the state of the jews was outstanding.  I don't think Luke was given enough kudos for his performance.  The music was wonderful and it kept me memorized during the entire movie.  I'm glad I have this in my DVD collection - and you will too!!!!,1206403200,3,404,4.346666666666667
2674335,1,B000JJSJO6,"I'll give it one star because the quality is much higher than any other Christian produced film I've ever seen. The sets and costumes were nice That's about all it has going for it though.

Poorly acted, overly complicated, unnecessary love interests, no attempt at any historical accuracy when it came to dialog. The accents were all over the place. The drama was dull. Even on fast forward it bored me.

I've not been this disappointed in a movie for a long time. The Bible is chock full of excellent story lines. Why must they be butchered so? If Christians are such a big consumer market, give us something that is worthy of consuming. Not this ""based on a novel that was based on a Bible story then with our own extra twist"" tripe.",1206316800,5,736,4.485074626865671
2674336,5,B000JJSJO6,"I have to say I started this movie with a wary mindset. I love movies and I do not limit myself only to spiritual movies, but on this occasion I was looking for a spiritual movie with biblical accuracy and I was not expecting to get it. This movie looked to hollywood and I was expecting an Ester love story. Instead it became quickly obvious that the creators of this film not only have read the Biblical book of Ester, but they also knew how to make a good movie. Some people will criticize the acting in the movie, or the sound. I on the other hand feel it's better to applaud the story telling ability in this movie, without compromising the true Biblical version. The creators did a great job with both. It's a notch above most other bible movies and I believe it is well worth the 2 hours you'll spend watching it. I want to watch the movie again, and it also makes me want to go read the book of Ester again. It reminded me how exciting the story of Ester really is, and it was nice to see a film highlight that, instead of hollywoodizing it.",1206057600,3,1049,4.223880597014926
2674337,5,B000JJSJO6,"Visually stunning dramatization of the Purim story, the movie brings to the screen in a thrilling and engaging way the story of Hadassah, the beautiful Jewish orphan girl who becomes Queen of Persia and saves her people from the annihilation planned by Haman (James Callis), the Agagite.
The prologue begins with the capture a few centuries before of Prince Agag by King Saul, and his execution by the Prophet Samuel (Peter O Toole).
Agag's pregnant wife escapes however and perpetuates the descent of the ancient enemy of Israel, the Amalekites.

Tiffany Dupont plays a beautiful, spirited, intelligent and engaging  Hadassah as we see something of the life of the Persian Jews in Susa, being raised by her uncle Mordecai (John Rhys-Davies), who adopted her when she was a little girl after her family were murdered by the Agagites.

We see several flashbacks to this event.
Haman is introduced amidst his scheming and his deep and ancient hatred of the Jewish people (his emblem is even that of the swastika.), and his Nazi/Hamas type rallies where he rails against the Jews. He continually alludes to the false alliance of the Jews with the Greeks and their plans to introduce democracy, pouring scorn on both the Jewish G-D and Greek democracy.
Very grand and majestic settings and a brilliant cast.
Luke Goss adds force to the role of Xerxes and the beautiful Indian actress Jyoti Dogra is perfect in the role of the proud and tragic Queen Vashti.
Several elements of intrigue are added to the story such as the plottings by Prince Admantha (John Noble) and Haman. Admantha is outwitted by Haman who rises to become Xerxe's prime minister.
Haman's plans to slaughter all the Jews in Persia, and building of a huge gallows erected for Mordecai who had refused to bow before Haman, thus incurring Haman's rage and hate.
Hadassah's pain and strength shine forth as she eventually manages to expose Haman and reveal herself as a Jewess - Hadassah Bat Abihail, to the beautiful scene of the appearance of the Stars of David floating across the horizon. The Star of David will triumph over all of Israel's enemies.

 She persuades Xerxes to cancel the evil decree of genocide.
The scene where Haman is caught by Xerxes in Hadassah's chamber has an added element of violence as Haman is actually caught strangling Hadassah by an enraged Xerxes, before being sent to his death.
Always we are reminded of the theme of the struggle of the Nation of Israel to survive through the millenia of persecution, where in each generation, a new enemy arises to try and annihilate the Jewish people.
At the end of the movie Mordecai is appointed the King's Chief Minister, and decrees the right of the Jews to rise up and defend themselves against those who aim to annihilate them. Certainly a relevant theme today.",1205625600,,2800,4.849372384937238
2674338,5,B000JJSJO6,"I love this movie only because it has hidden truths in it. You have to watch this movie with the eyes and ears of the Holy Spirit or you do not really get it. A person has to already know the story of Esther to appreciate the story line and it's value. The movie brings out many parables but again you have to know Biblical Truth to see it. For example, at the end when Esther reveals who she really is, she makes a statement that is so powerful in the spirit realm yet it does not make an impact on her natural listeners. The kife of the statement cuts through the darkness and shines forth the Light of Jehovah and his covenant with His people. It wants to make you stand up with her and shout,""YOU BETCHA!""
Throughout the movie there are many such statements and actions as this that will fall on deaf ears and blind eyes if you do not watch it with the Holy Spirit's guidance and direction. Definately a movie for a Christian who knows Kingdom power, yet not to say that the Lord cannot use it as a tool for evangelism in other areas. I have watched it again and again and find something new in it each time. Pray before you watch.",1205452800,,1135,4.187214611872146

However, it seems to show the atmosphere of intrigue, mistrust, hatred and even love which must exist in any place of power and the acting is reasonable.  Having said this I feel it could have been better if the producer and director had had a little more faith in the original story of Esther which doesn't need any ""improvements"".",1203811200,,457,4.62962962962963

(historical knowledge of that time period won't allow every gap to be filled anyway, so obviously some guesswork or interpretation will always be involved in a movie like this)

I didn't give it 5 stars because during some scenes I thought it wasn't exactly accurate with the Biblical account (maybe the makers took dramatic license, but I prefer accuracy).  But other than that, we really enjoyed it.  It made me think about many of the aspects of life back then that I hadn't thought about before.",1200268800,,662,4.721739130434782

Even if you already know the story, the romance, humour and intrigue add just enough spice to the plot to keep you interested. Computer graphics are used to reproduce the architectural splendour of the Babylonian capital and the cinematography gives the movie a luxurious, big-budget feel. Although the dialogue is a little unclear sometimes, the acting is good overall and Tiffany Dupont makes a charming, captivating Esther. It's rated PG so it's easy to watch with friends at home (the romance is tastefully done and violence is minimal).

I thought every actor in this movie did an impeccable job with the exception of the lead role ""Esther."" Tiffany Dupont is a newcomer and really could not carry the movie. I think the burden fell primarily on the King (Luke Goss). He carried the movie well and I almost believed he could be a real King with his stature and demeanor in this film. I wish the directors would have taken the time to find a better fit for him to be the leading lady because although Tiffany had the looks, there was little chemistry between them and frankly Esther's dialogue was bland. At times, it was very immature and modern...not at all the same dialogue that was spoken by the other actors. It was almost like they took a 16 year old from the 21st century, changed her clothes and threw her in the role. The story is beautiful though and the message to me was not only of self-sacrifice, but of love and honor. It's worth watching at least twice!

Can this woman with her faith in God, use her soft power to overcome influence of king's court advisors and save the lives and future of her Jewish people?  While actors portraying quueen Esther and king Xerxes are so beautiful to look at, we are delighted to see appearances in smaller roles by Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole.  It is these two actors that are giving us the impression that we are watching a true spectacle.

Then about half-way through my friend and I were both on the edge of our seats, hoping and praying Esther would come out okay.  And we were both completely enchanted by the film.  It sticks to the Biblical account fairly well and shows why what Esther did was so brave.  Nowadays it seems strange that her going to speak to her own husband was such a scandalous thing, but this movie really shows what admiration it took; given the constraints of the time period.

2674373,4,B000JJSJO6,"I enjoyed this movie for its style, its panache, the cinematography, the costumes, and the beauty of the actors. I will not complain about the audibility because I deliberately set the subtitles on all films these days for that very reason. They were very helpful, even though some of the history was so convoluted that even though I am a Bible scholar, the logic was lost on me as to why Esther was so insistent upon going to Jerusalem that she left home, and then decided, when the opportunity presented itself to spend one night with the King, that she didn't want to go after all - even though her best friend (and potential lover) had been castrated by said King's army. I've always been rather partial to Vashti, who stood up to the King and refused to endorse his war. Near the end of the movie, Esther seems to empathize with Vashti and shows concern for her banishment - but that is not in Scripture, and does Vashti no favors at that point.

But, it was entertaining, I will give it that. Don't use it for Bible class. Not necessarily a date movie, unless you are dating a Born Again Fundamentalist. Produced by Fox Faith, by the way, which I did not know existed - an entire end run by Fox to extend its agenda.

So many times people look at the Bible as a collection of stories.  It's important that we remember that the Bible is a book of history (HIS story).  That the people of the Bible once walked this earth.  That the events actually happened - to real people!

God Chasers, God Catchers, God's Dream Team et al. but this movie is far from the biblical depiction of the story. Sure, there should be room for addition to complete the storyline and be creative but to stray from the truth of the story is not appreciable. If someone watches the movie and then reads the biblical account of the story, they'll be puzzled as to which one is true! There seem to be glaring differences from theoriginal story. With a limited budget and other limitations I can surely understand the choice of amature actors and the scenes in India (mostly at least) but the story must be biblically focussed if we're by any means trying to reach the un-believers. I don't regret having bought this DVD but I'd say that its not a well written script, well directed acting or well edited movie.

2674376,1,B000JJSJO6,"I would love to see more wholesome, Christian films brought to the  big screen with the same production values of a Hollywood budget, but this isn't one of them.  Some may say there wasn't enough money in the budget to make it on par with a Hollywood film, but I disagree in a sense, even though more money may have brought better sound and lighting quality in spots.

The film's primary problems are the muddled script (which the book that it's based upon puts to everlasting shame), and the homegrown, amateurish acting and accents that go along with this mess.  If the acting and script were excellent, the sound and lighting would go largely unnoticed.

It seems that much of the Christian community will praise even a very badly done Biblically based film, because they are fearful that without their adulation and word of mouth support, another one will never get made. I say hogwash! Make it inspiring and touching and word of mouth won't need to be artificial.  The only reason I gave it one star is because it does have a few beautiful sets and lush scenes.

2674399,2,B000JJSJO6,"While it is laudable that someone would want to make a film of the story of Esther and keep it clean enough for family viewing, it is a shame that someone didn't do it that had a higher regard for the biblical text.  Why use the Bible if you won't follow it?

I have no problem adding details and making up details to fill in the missing part of the biblical narrative.  I do have a problem fabricating completely erroneous items and then leaving out facts from the story itself.

The details added about the escaped Queen of Agag in order to explain Haman's association with King Agag and the Amalekites made me uncomfortable.  It seemed to go too far and implied that the biblical account in I Samuel 15 is lacking.

The mystical ""Star of David"" jewel was way overboard and puts the whole story in the realm of fantasy instead of historical fact.  This is probably by far the most bothersome thing about the film.

Haman was thrilled and honored to be invited to the private banquet with Esther and the King, not fighting against it as the movie portrays.

There were TWO banquets, not one.

Esther did not come before the king a la ""The Two Towers"" by bursting through the doors--what absolute silliness.  She was standing in the court and the king held out his scepter for her to approach.

As has been mentioned, the acting is wooden and stilted.  The relationship between the king and Esther is hokey and completely based upon modern Western Hollywood sentimentalities.

On the positive side (and this is VERY positive), violence is discreet, there is no swearing, and the physical relationships are prudently handled, meaning no nudity and ""bed"" scenes.  This story is potentially rampant with sensuality, so the producers' restraint is to be commended. Thy followed the principles of Christian morality and sensibilities, as well as the biblical injunction not to dwell on evil.

The funny thing is that it is neither a good Bible version of the story nor a good love story.  If the acting and storyline had been romantic, my wife and I might overlook some of the inaccuracies.  But the acting and lines we so disjointed that combined with the lack of biblical accuracy, there just isn't much left.  In other words, bad acting but accurate story = OK; good acting and romantic storyline but so-so accuracy = OK.  However, bad acting and bad storyline/accuracy = what's left?

Anyway, I used to have it on a list to buy thinking it might make a nice, clean addition to our library.  After having watched it, I don't think I will.",1190419200,12,2536,4.664414414414415

2674401,2,B000JJSJO6,"Ester certainly is material for a wonderful movie. It has love, hate, intrigue and everything else in between that makes for a good movie. However, it is also a story of hope and faith and belief in the ONE Creator that will save a portion of a nation!
What is a SERIOUS problem though, is when a script writer takes too much freedom and changes a story from Scripture to fit his script! In this I do not say anything against Tommy Tenney, the author of the book, but the script writer. I did not read Tenney's book. My wife did and many time s, though, I she queried tings and I had to correct her according to Scripture! Since I did read the book I do not want to comment on it.
The movie, great to have would have been better left than making something not true to Scripture. Sure authors or script writers believe they have artistic freedom. Perhaps in another setting but not Scripture.
It was true disappointing to see that Ester sends word to Mordechai to get the people to fast for the night and she'll go before the king the next day! Absolutely absurd. Scripture says they had to fast & pray for 3 days!!! The absurdity of a Magen David (Star of David) that has NEVER been a Jewish or Israelite symbol until recent years with the start of Zionism!!
Then there is the king identified as Xerxes, a Greek name for a Babylonian king identified in the Book of Ester in Scripture as Ahasuerus. Many (if not most) belief that this was rather Artaxerxes I and not Xerxes. Even so, using the Scriptural name would make far more sense. I tend to see Hellenising even of the story of Ester (Hadassah) as with all of the ""New Testament"".
There is a lot more to say, but I'll keep to this. Definitely not true to Scripture!!!

Suppose because it is Christian and not Jewish or Israelite!!",1190332800,2,1785,4.376506024096385

He said it was so apparent how closely our God is with us no matter how much evil is trying to mess with our lives. Our Lord was guiding circumstances the entire time, He protected Esther when she was to be put to death, His Spirit touched those who would be touched.

2674404,3,B000JJSJO6,"The Story of Esther is a powerful one, but sadly this movie lacked the ""umph"" it needed to really convey its significance.  The movie was shot on location in India which was a valiant effort to make the kingdom of Persia look authentic, but the acting came in fits and blows.  Despite the star power, some actors were brilliant in their delivery while others were not.  Tiffany Dupont did a nice job as Esther, but there was no consistency throughout the movie.  Some actors had British accents, others American, etc.  While this shouldn't be a deciding factor on the story-tellting, it is very distracting.

The script:  predictably medieval for a time that happened thousands of years earlier.

The costumes and the sets were the best thing about the movie.  Not a bad effort but could have been done much better regardless of budget.",1189209600,,836,4.79020979020979
2674405,3,B000JJSJO6,"I have mixed feelings on this. For one I adore the actress who plays Esther in this story she is precious. I thought the costumes and the set  were super Persian, so it was a feast for the eyes! I loved how the characters were portrayed..like the Eunuch. He really made the movie..my issue is more with the screen play and probably the novel this was taken from. We were often scratching our head saying ""hmmm what's the point of that discourse????""(this knowing the original story which helped, but if you don't know it, I could see where you might get confused at parts.)  I really appreciate that they were very respectful in the way they portrayed their intimate moments, making it one of the few family movies put out today. That said, why didn't they just stick to the historical records;could they not have studied the Greeks better as well?? Were the Greeks the ones who leveled the playing field for the slaves and had true democracy? (visit MT olympia for a cursory review! They gave us the polis (city/states)but they were not the ones who gave us ""God made man in His image"" = all men , women and slaves are created equal..thats purely Hebrew!)The Persians had the same idealism as the Greeks, so you really didn't have to create this Haman hatred because the Jews were the great fighters of democracy like their Greek enemies ... rather than this revisionist American idea, just the truth would have been so much better! The Jews were a conquered people, so when Mordachi would not bow down to anyone but God..you could see Haman and his hatred of this pompous Jew not bowing to a Persian...that scene would have been much more realistic especially since thats what really did happen! Not only that, but the creation of a misunderstanding of Esther and Xeres really didn't add to the story. For one, we all know that had any king like Xeres suspected infidelity...it would have been ""off with her head"" so that really leaves you with this feeling of it just doesn't smack real..I mean Eunuchs were Eunuchs for that reason right? The actual history was much better. Another example...If you simply laid out who Xeres truly was, you would totally understand ,like the Bible expects you to, why Esther was scared to death! Esther knew she could live or die on his whim, she saw him put people to death every day... you really didn't have to create an elaborate story for her to be scared of him.....it demeans the real story to portray that she walks through the rain, causing a stir in ""Congress"" only to invite him to a dinner party.  So to inject this thinking in there only destroyed the tried and true story which is super exciting and fits our historical facts we know and find every day in the field of archaeology! I normally am very happy for anything that may even sound Christian, But when people start twisting the bible narratives and they make them unrealistic they take real historical documents and turn them into mythology. After knowing the real story, I really felt they had the perfect plot laid out and could have elaborated fictionally within the actual factual things to make this historically accurate and super facinating. That is why it gets only 3 stars from me..",1188777600,3,3200,4.6601769911504425
2674406,3,B000JJSJO6,"It's rather unfortunate, to put it mildly, that Tiffany Dupont plays Hadassah, the niece of Mordechai in the tale of the Persian Queen Esther. There's nothing queenly about her, pretty though she may be, and gorgeous in royal robes.

Somehow, the trailers that I saw of this movie made it look appealing, and it was a serious disappointment, all the way around. The film has the same 1950s quality as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00015HX90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;with Charlton Heston. Lots of great costumes and kingly head shots, very little worthy acting, and very little Biblical quality.

That is really a shame. Because King Xerxes (Luke Goss) looks kingly, what with his nice crowns and specially alluring eye makeup and all, and his ever-so-earnest wish for a truly loving wife.

It's also too bad because one really wants, especially, to love Esther's uncle Mordechai (John Rhys-Davies)

But the story of Queen Esther is ever so much more dramatic in the Meggilah, the scroll that is read every year on eve of the 14th day of Adar, when Queen Esther successfully plead with the Babylonian king, Xerxes, to save the Jewish people from Haman's plot to destroy them.

It's too bad, really. This could have been a great movie. Oh well, you can't win them all.",1188432000,,1426,5.613953488372093
2674417,3,B000JJSJO6,"Lights!  Camera!  Weird costuming?  Sadly, yes.  The worst part of this movie is the weirdest justaposition of costuming I have ever seen in any movie!  King Ahasures wears clothing -- and crowns -- more suitable for King Arthur!  His evil cousin looks like someone dressed straight out of the court of Louis XIV!  Esther-Hadassah, and the other aspirants for queenhood, are dressed in clothing that could easily be mistaken for 19th century party dresses.  And Queen Vashti, is dressed in one scene in a dress that could have come from the court of Louis XVI, (without a petticoat), and in another, with a head-gear that could easily have been from Outer Space -- or somewhere. A little research on the part of the costume designer could have gone a long way in making this film look, and feel, more realistic!  (More on the bad costuming to come.....)

The best part of this film?  The Music!  Melodic without getting maudlin, the music echos the best ""movie spectacular"" music of past.  The themes sounded timeless....most could have been used in any spectacle film.  There is just a tiny touch of what we have come to expect as ""ancient Hebraic""....but it is generalized, far more, into the genre of ""general grand movie heroic"" ....which is good -- because I, for one, find myself exteremely embarrassed at the maudlin tone too-often given ""Jewish"" music offered in most films.  Thankfully -- and beautifully -- a ""grand movie heroic"" score more than sufficed here.

This movie, indeed, tries hard to be good, in all departments.  You can tell that everyone involved
in it was very dedicated to bringing The Bible's Book of Esther to life.
Tiffany Dupont was truly excellent and very, very believable as the
girl-into-woman queen, and, as Xerxes, Luke Goss was almost as credible.
Omar Sharif, as always, was truly a standout, in believability of character, and acting.  Unfortunately, (as always), John Ryhs-Davis
comes across as trying just a bit too hard, (except in the very beginning scenes when Ms. Dupont -- as Hadassah -- dances around their modest
home, and Mr. Rhys-Davis, it seemed, could not help but be caught up in
the believabilty of the moment she has created.  Mr. Rhys-Davis is a fine
actor -- if only he didn't try so hard, which leads to over-acting, if only just slightly.  Relax, please Mr. Rhys-Davis -- just pretend you are
the character and don't try so hard.  You don't have to try that hard....your very considerable screen presence does that for you; just relax, and ""go with the flow"", as they say.

Peter O'Toole, at the beginning, in an important cameo part, also over-
acts a bit.  But his part, though prominent, is too miniscule to notice the over-acting very much.

The script was more at fault in the unbelievability of the story than any of the actors, however.  Firstly, we are treated to the ludicrous idea Hadassah's Uncle Mordechai is finally allowing his neice to travel, on her own, back to Judea, as is now permitted Jews of the Persian Empire to finally do.  Jews -- yes.  Young girls -- NO!  We'ere still in Biblical times, here, don't forget!  Young women were VERY closely guarded -- especially one so beloved by her uncle as Haddassah!  She is NOT a 20th or 21sr century woman, don't forget!  Hadassah appears to be about 17 when the movie begins -- and for a well-brought-up, 17-year-old girl to be given permission by her uncle/guardian to trapse, (all by herself!) to Jerusalem from Shushan, is about as believable as that same Uncle/Guardian to ask her to become a ""loose woman""!  Because, in those days, it could easily have evolved into the very same thing!  It's true that, a little LATER on in the film, her could-be boyfriend, Jessie, did offer to go with her.....but this was totally of his OWN idea, and was not, (incredibly), even mentioned by Mordechai!  (We're NOT talking about a 20th or 21st-century career girl here.  Yes, Mordechai taught Hadassah to read -- unusual enough.  But....going to Jerusalem....alone?????  NICE girls just didn't do that.....Then!

It was also truly heart-breaking, just a little later on, to see Hadassah's beginning-to-be-boyfriend, (at the start of the movie), turned
forcibly into a palace servant....and more.....  He starts out as a
very handsome guy, with an, (OK, slightly incongruous), fine head of very blonde hair, a mischievous, carefree manner, and colorful clothes...and winds up with a scarf on his head, hiding his hair, (or is that a new, forced baldness), wearing olive-drab palace servant garb.  He and Hadassah
had wanted to go to live in Jerusalem... But on the day, (with Hadassah's
Uncle Mordechai's consent), they were about to do this.....Hadassah is
captured to be a candidate in the new-queen contest, while poor Jesse is also captured....and more of him is taken off than his hair!  I don't know....but it really seemed to me that before this, Haddassah and Jesse were beginning to fall in love....and then this queen-thing had to happen.  If I had been Haddassah-Esther, I would have found it VERY difficult indeed to fall in love with a king....no matter how kind or how handsome....if his orders had completely ruined the life, (and manhood), of the boy I was beginning to like....  Jesse does wind up as the Queen's ally, which is nice to see.  But -- to make the story more believable, and Xerxes' and Esther's love more real -- I would have eliminated the character of Jesse altogether.  Or make him fall in love with, or be promised to, someone else.  As it is, having the movie turn Jessie into an unwilling servant makes Esther -- even with all the believabilty Tiffany Dupont puts into the character -- seem awfully fickle.....

Persian men -- especially Persian rulers -- mostly wore beards.  LONG, artificially curling beards.  Today's audience, however, usually does not find long, curling beards on men as attractive.  I was wondering how this situation would be handled.  Well, it was handled giving Xerxes a mustache, and just a small beard.  OK --- but they weren't curling, after the manner of the real Ancient Persians.  This -- plus his long straight hair, and pointed crown, made him look more like King Arthur than Xerxes!
SOMETHING more should have been done!

I noticed that Haman's amulet, the Aggite symbol, resembled a swastika in
some respects.  I don't know if this was accurate, but it speaks volumes to a modern audience.  However, although known as Aggites, Haman's ancestral people are better known as the AMALIKITES.  Both ancestral names could have been used...but in this movie, only the word ""Aggite"" described this ethnic group.  And -- in the Bible, at least in the Jewish versions -- Xerxes is known as ""Ahasures"".  Surely -- at least at the beginning of the movie, within the Hebrew quarter of the city -- he should have been referred to, at least once, as ""Ahasures"".  But no, the king is always called ""Xerxes"", (his Greek name!), throughout the movie.
And the capital city of the Persian Empire was always ""Shushan"", as far as I know.  Here, for some unfathonable reason, it is always ""Suzhan"".
Not as big a blunder, in my estimation, as the costuming-from-King-Arthur's-day-masquerading as Biblical garb, or the non-curling, even a little, of King Ahasure's (who????) beard....but still adding to the non-believability of the action on-screen.

The King's evil cousin wears a hairstyle that would be at home in the court of Louis XIII.  Vashti's clothes seem right out of the court of Louis XV....and her hairstyle, in one crucial scene, seems from outer-space, or somewhere.  These multi-century costumes had me thinking of the fantasy TV series, ""Dinotopia"", where people from many centuries come together, co-existing with each other and with dinosaurs.  Not a bad show -- but should NOT be something one is reminded of, via costuming, watching a movie version of The Book of Esther!  A real no-no, that could SO easily have been prevented by a little historical costume research.  (Strangely, Omar Shariff's costumes...although perhaps not 100% authentic...did NOT look out of place at all.  Dark and/or flowing, they
took one immediately to Ancient Persia, especially when he was bareheaded, and did not have to wear the only slightly incongruous headgear given him.  As for most of the other costumes....a real mix-up, or, as the Yiddish expression goes, ""Kasha & Borsht""  (don't mix!)

The towering scenery takes one's breath away.  However, I'm not sure it is accurate.  I DO know, however, that the SEWING of cloth into clothing
did not take place until about the 1400s.  Before then, people mostly draped their garments.  Too many costumes in this Biblical epic came across as looking as if they were from the 14th century....A.D, NOT B.C!
The diadems of the Biblical periods I have seen are mainly ciclets, some gold, and some with jewels....but NOT with points!  Xerxes looked too much like King Arthur in too many scenes!  And Esther-Hadassah's dresses looked far too much like party-dressees from the 1890s, instead of the draped robes people wore in biblical times!  This mis-juxtapositioning of clothing styles takes a LOT away from the believabilty of the movie!

The script was creditable in most scenes.  But in other scenes, credulity was strained by stilted dialogue.  And embarrassing dialogue. The last scene, wherein Mordechai, newly made a minister-advisor to the King, decribes himself as, ""I, Mordechai, Prince of Persia....a Jew"", is truly embarrassing to those who, like myself, were taught in Hebrew School that Jews are no better, and no worse than anyone else, and that the only reason Jews are called ""The Chosen People"" is because they were chosen to help God give the world The Ten Commandments.  But that happened 5,000 years ago....and today, every Human Being is pretty much the same, with only God above everyone!  (One God = everyone is equal -- get it????)

It was nice, however, to see Haman lump together the ""democracy"" ideal of the Greeks, (the enemy of the Persians), with the ""one God"" idea of the Jews, (who were the enemy of Haman).  If the villian of a film puts two groups together as his enemies, then they are, per force, both good-guy
groups, and have a lot in common!  As in Tiffany Dupont's delightful and realistic portrayal of, not just a Jewish girl....but a Human one....this putting together of ""Jews"" and ""Greeks"" -- even by Haman, the bad guy, should help to bring ALL people together, as good guys....and for all of us ""good guys"" to see more similarity than differences in each other.

This movie is a LOT better than the truly awful 1961 epic, Esther And The King, which is full of hackneyed dialogue, and which actually OMITS the climactic scene wherein Queen Esther, risking her life for her peoples', enters the King's throne-room unannounced.  Mordechai, melodramatically, appears in chains in once scene in ""Esther and The King"", and, although the stars in that 1961 movie, (Joan Collins and Richard Eagan), try real hard, nothing could save it, with that hackneyed dialogue and script.  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is certainly an improvement.....but the BEST version I have read of this story, (and there are many book versions), is
Gladys Malvern's true classic ""BEHOLD YOUR QUEEN"", (also reveiewed by me
for Amazon.)  Now, THAT book would make the PERFECT ""Purim"" movie....and I do hope someone buys the rights to it soon, and makes a movie of it.
In the meantime, despite it's many flaws and inadequacies, ""One Night With The King"", seems to be the best ""Purim"" movie we have, at least so far....

P.S.  I'm looking forward to seeing other movies with TIFFANY DUPONT them!
If there is one spark of true vitality, and even more important, true
believability in ""One Night With The King"".....Ms. DuPont is it!!!!!",1188259200,3,11755,4.917808219178082
2674418,4,B000JJSJO6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, however Orthodox Jews who have been trained in the commentary surrounding the Megillah of Esther will find certain things lacking: 1. Esther was not only the neice of Mordechai, but also his Wife. 2. Esther was 40 years old when she was taken into the court of Ahashuerus, 3. Mordecai issued a ""herem"" (""Vetbot,"" ""fatwah"",) forbidding all the Jews to participate in the feast of Ahasherus and Vashti, 4. Vashti refused to come before the king because he commanded her to appear NAKED (except the for royal crown), nothing to do with the Greeks (which took place centuries later).

The only mistake was the birthday pendant with the star of david in it (which was not a Jewish symbol at the time)  They may have celebrated birthdays since they were in a pagan nation (I know unbelieving Jews who have pagan christmas trees in their homes every year and we do know many Jews in Ancient Israel were also pagan or incorporated pagan traditions and customs - that's why G-d sent them to exile)",1186704000,,833,4.42483660130719

But why were there changes made to the story to make it more Hollywoodized?  If there was ever a perfect story to present just as it was in the original, this would have to have been one of them!

I found the political intrigue of the movie to be confusing, and frankly, part of the reason for that is that you can't always understand what the actors are saying.  The reason they contrived for the queen to dishonor the king's command to appear seemed artificial and unbelievable, at least to me--a 21st-century antiwar message stuffed uncomfortably into a warrior society.  And the final confrontation between the king and the queen and the antagonist was nothing like the scripture text.

2674424,3,B000JJSJO6,"""One Night With the King"" is a movie that looks like it wanted to be more than it turned out to be. Based on the story of a woman obeying God for the benefit of her people, the Jews, despite the promise of great peril, ""One Night With the King"" misses the mark.

Her story is well-known to any student of ancient literature, CCD or Sunday school. It is up there with Jonah, Noah, Adam and Eve, and the death and resurrection of Jesus. Even agnostics and atheists who are versed in the classics can provide the plot. With this, there are expectations: bring a major story to film and treat it properly.

With lines that come across stiff and stuffy, characters become cartoons, and do not live as real people. How can we believe actors speaking in a mock Shakespearean dialect? I couldn't.

Esther was flirtatious, flighty and yet bold from the first moment. Her character reminded me of Princess Jasmine in Disney's ""Aladdin."" This is not the unassuming future leader we read about, but a different Esther. When the grand decision must be made, she does not struggle in mortal angst as did the biblical version.

The plot itself didn't merit a long movie. A shorter piece, maybe 90 minutes, would have sufficed.

I felt like I was watching ""The Robe,"" in all its effort to send a message, gets lost in a mediocre script.

Esther is a great story in its original form that has incredible big screen potential. Too many liberties were taken, and the production quality was sub-par. It was not a horrible movie, but I won't give it a pass just because I'm a Christian wanting to see biblical stories in film.

2674425,4,B000JJSJO6,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie, it was a better attempt than most to stay close to the Biblical account of Esther. I think it's understandable that some dialogue & even characters would be added to flesh out the story to make a movie, but I only gave it 4 stars because the film makers did make at least one major mistake in this area. The special pendant which she treasures (not a part of the Bible account) was received as a birthday present from her parents. If they had done their research, they would have found that the Jews did not celebrate birthdays at this time in history; they considered it to be a custom practiced by the pagan nations surrounding them. That was the most glaring mistake I noticed. The movie had some interesting explanations for how Esther caught the king's eye in the first place, & later, for why she hadn't been called to him in a while, why she would be so hesitant to approach him, details that aren't given in the Bible account. Overall, I enjoyed the movie & would recommend it.",1180742400,3,1016,4.467741935483871
2674426,2,B000JJSJO6,"One Night With The King is a pretty film, and a romantic film, but it is not a Christian film. The production design team has gone overboard trying to make the film appeal to girls. I can't remember the last time I saw so many flowers on screen, unless it was Doctor Zhivago. And the writer, basing his script on the novel by Mark Andrew Olsen, has gone overboard to make the story as romantic as possible, also appealing to girls. It is a romantic extravaganza.

But the story of Esther, as it comes from the Bible, is not a romance. It is a political thriller, if anything. On the one hand, we have Xerxes, the young king of Persia, who needs a new wife because the previous one was disrespectful and disobedient. On the other, we have Haman, an ambitious man who, because Mordecai won't give him the respect he thinks he deserves, is driven by jealousy to destroy Mordecai and his people. And then there is Esther, the young woman caught in the middle, who comes into the king's court, ""for such a time as this."" As circumstances turn out, only she can save Mordecai and her people from Haman, and she does so by using her position as the king's new bride.

While there is opportunity to glamorize court life and make marriage to the king something to daydream about, the main plot is one of genocide, equal to the Holocaust. To play that down in order to give the girls a little romance betrays the heart of the story. I don't believe Esther was the silly teenager portrayed by Tiffany Dupont. Nor do I think Xerxes was the star-struck romantic portrayed by Luke Goss. And Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, who plays Hegai, the Royal Eunuch, is just plain terrible. Why in the world would they have cast someone with a speech impediment in such an important role? Most of what he says is totally garbled.

The simple, straightforward story as it comes to us from the Bible has been so altered and convoluted that it is almost unrecognizable as the story of Esther. Characters' motivations have been changed, there are key characters, like Prince Admantha, that don't even exist in the original, and the plot has been changed to a different story entirely. Most of the characters end up in the same place as the Bible story, but how they get there is totally different.

What is really unforgivable is the fact that, rather than letting God be the hero of the story, the filmmakers introduce a magical pendant that produces stars of David on the wall. According to the new plot, the magic pendant is actually responsible for changing Xerxes mind, not God, because when he gives the reason to Esther, he says, ""I saw the stars."" God is not even involved in delivering His people. Even though God's name is not mentioned in the book of Esther, we all know who delivers the Jews in the end. It's not a magic pendant. That's a different religion.

Why would Fox Faith change a story that has become one of the most beloved in both Jewish and Christian tradition? Why would they base it on a novel instead of the Bible account, which is so clear? Why would they spend so much money on sets and costumes, and then ignore script, directing and acting. And why would they introduce a magic pendant into the story? This film is a real mystery.

Conclusion? Fox Faith has laid a big, expensive egg, and one on which they probably won't get their money back. To date, it's made less than $14 M domestically. Any more like this, and they can close down their new ""Christian"" division. Maybe they should get some real Christian filmmakers in there to show them what a Christian film is, plus some decent directors, writers and actors. Anything but what they're using now.

I Love how the King adored Esther and how she defied both the king and the empire to do what she thought was right for her people. I wish that there were more scenes between Esther and the king telling of their love for eachother and more intimate nature however the story was just as enchanting without them as it left alot to the imagination.

There were insightfull and creative ways they filled in the blanks, read between the lines, and put you in Esther (Hadassa) and Mordakia's shoes-without changing the essence of the Biblical story.

We rented this one and we could not get more than 30 minutes into it.  What a waste of time.  This could only be of interest to the religious type that needs a refill of inspiration or something.  Only tolerable for the very religious type.

The story jumps about in such a way that you had better know it before you start.  [I have read the Bible, all of it.]

The main thing I found about the film:  horribly wooden acting performances.  You would have to be terribly distracted by your love of the plot or by the costumes (or something) to not be put off by the terrible acting.  The actors are reading off cue-cards they've never seen before -- or at least it seems like that.  I never thought I would see such a terrible performance by Peter O'Toole -- the director should be banned for life.  You'd think with Peter O'Toole and and Omar Sharif (and others) they could do something (remember Lawrence of Arabia?!).  Oh man!

Everything about the film seemed sappy and amateurish.  Terrible direction and editing.  So bad we had to turn it off.

If you are very into Bible stories, you might like it.  (Though it's not fit to be stored on the same shelf with ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Ben Hur."")",1177632000,7,1214,4.416289592760181
2674454,5,B000JJSJO6,"What a great movie!! There are so many reasons I enjoyed this film. Ironically I never heard about it at all until I purchased the DVD at a yard sale for only $2 !  I have watched it countless times since and it's like the movie that ""keeps on going"". One of the reasons I liked it so much is because it inspired me to get back into digging up history so to speak. I think far too often folks take information at face value or hastily gloss over information which, if researched can actually be the beginning of an exciting adventure!

I liked all the characters in the movie except the man who played the kings cousin. His fake hair just annoyed me everytime I looked at it, and the man who played Haman's constant grating voice was a little too much. I agree with some of the reviewers in the colum who said the sound quality wasn't the best: I had to watch the movie several times to actually catch everything that was being said, but that's ok as it was worth it. Another irony, you can hear Esther and Xerxes kissing just fine!

Interesting things: it made me realize just how powerful kings might have been in times past, how much women were treated as ""less than"" (I am so glad I am a female in the U.S. in this day in age!!) and just how stupid idol/demon worship is. It also made me realize just how different people really are, and how the ""powers that be"" keep trying to make this ""one world"" thing happen, well it's just not gonna happen. History repeats itself and everything old is new again. I see people looking to their spiritual past to see their spiritual future.

The other comments in the column about how the scenery was more Indian than Persian, well, as far as I am aware, there's not much left of ancient Persian buildings, but since Indian building seem to be timeless, and since Xerxes ruled from ""India to Ethiopia"", then why not? Makes sense to me. There's not that much distance between the middle east and the far east these days. It was nice to see people of several different ethinicities in the film as Xerxes' kingdom was so diverse I think that was well represented. It was kind of funny to have three of the main stars be folks of European descent. I was glad to see Omar Shariff as his acting is always superb. I didn't like the fact that Peter O'Toole made a super-brief cameo in the film, yet got top billing. What about John Rhys Davies who's played some great roles and has a large part in this film and his name isn't mentioned until after the title, almost unsceen? That was dissappointing.

It took some research to find out that Xerxes and Ahaseurus are the same person. Why he has two names I do not know, but in my Bible, he's called Ahaseurus. I appreciate the fact that this film was made. I'd really like to see more movies made that are based on historical fact and not all ""Hollywoodized"". People around the world are becoming more in touch with their roots and I feel more films like this one will cause people to ""dig deeper"". I think the love story part was a bit Hollywoodized as in reality I've read Esther ""pleased"" him above all the others and that cane be taken in several ways!! I'm going to try to think along the good line of God gave her favor in his eyes and not think about what Xerxes might have been thinking about. It does seem seriously lame that he dumped his first wife (Vashti) because she didn't come when he called her. No wonder her son killed him later in life! (You divorced my mom for no good reason, die sucka!) or something like that (kidding). Who know what really happened as none of us were there. I encourage all to do research on the characters and on ancient Persia as I found it very interesting.",1176768000,2,3685,4.350290697674419
2674455,1,B000JJSJO6,"The movie starts with the Israelite slaughter of the Amalekites, 500 years before the supposed events in the Book of Esther.  The narration asserts that God told King Saul to kill all of the Amalekites, men, women and children (including infants) and all of their animals because the Amalekites were (get ready for it) child sacrificers. At least that was what was implied by calling them ""...an ancient, child sacrificing enemy.""

Actually, according to the bible, God's reason for wanting the Amalekites killed was because they had opposed the hebrews coming into Israel.  No mention of child sacrificing.  If you want the exact quote, here it is, ""Thus says the Lord of Hosts, 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.  Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' "" (1 Samuel 15, 2)

According to biblical sources, there is no reason to suppose that the Amalekites ever sacrificed children.  In fact, it is said that they too had been nomads like the hebrews and it was suggested that they were descendants of Esau, brother of Jacob.

Really, after watching a depiction of supposed God induced genocide, no matter how excused by modern apologists (child sacrificers indeed), I'm supposed to be on the Israelites' side against a descendant of the last surviving Amalekite? And I'm supposed to accept that the Israelites deserved God's punishment because King Saul disobeyed God by sparing that one last Amalekite? There was one very scary review posted here that seemed to suggest that if ""God"" tells you to, you'd better committ genocide or else.  But that is also what the movie makers seem to be implying as well.

I'm sorry but that is insane.  There were other ways it could have been handled without accepting the primitive bloodthirsty desert deity in 1 Samuel as a true depiction of God. At the very least let there be a suggestion that Haman had a very good reason for wanting revenge for his people.  But no, the poor Amalkelites have to be smeared as ""child sacrificers"" so their slaughter can be made more palatable to modern audiences.  And they call this ""Christian"" film making?  Ugh!",1176681600,4,2284,4.8081841432225065
2674456,1,B000JJSJO6,"This movie starts out with an incomplete back-story, 500 years before the main story.  But, unless someone is well versed in the Bible, or the Torah, the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment. It jumps to the main story for a few minutes, then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs, but it's still not clear what is going on.

The description says Hadassah hid her religion, but it's not as hidden as you'd think it would be.  Over and over again, she and her uncle talk about being Jews, the housekeeper calls them Jews, their friends call them Jews, and there are even more flashbacks to Hadassah's childhood showing how she grew up Jewish.  She even reads from a scroll of a Biblical tale to children in the market.  If this is how she hides her religion, I'd hate to see what she'd do to flaunt it.

Actress Tiffany Dupont tries to give Hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world.  She's a teenager longing to explore her roots, and the world at large.  This would go well in having teens relate to her, but the dialog gets in the way.  The writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the Bible.  The complex dialog is spewed out, sometimes as quickly as possible, without any real inflection.  This causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable.  And, unfortunately, even the more seasoned  actors stumble over the formalized wording, further distancing the viewer from the story.

If you're really into Biblical stories, then maybe you'd enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic, it's best to look elsewhere.  (I could only endure a half-hour.)",1176595200,3,1780,4.715210355987055

The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible.  The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?).  I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed.  There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.

I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone.  This one unfortunately missed the mark.",1176249600,3,778,4.669117647058823

2674469,3,B000JJSJO6,"At the beginning of this film before the opening credits is a brief advertisement stating that this film is part of Fox Christian Network; i.e. this film was made by Christians to convey a Christian message.  The film then begins with a flashback to the past and the origins of a blood feud between the Jews and the Agagites.  The movie then fast forwards to Hadassah living with her aunt and uncle outside of Susa in Persia.  They are part of the Jewish minority in the Persian empire.  All is not well inside the walls of Susa.  King Xerxes of Persia is young and does not command the respect of all his princes and ministers.  Many of the latter want war with the Greeks, some for glory, some for riches, and others to get the King out of Persia thereby opening the way for a new leader.  They know the King's wife is against war, and several princes scheme to get rid of her, which they accomplish.  King Xerxes must then take a new wife, and he chooses Hadassah.  In her position, she becomes aware of schemes to kill the King and the Jews, and she in turn schemes to turn these back, while keeping the love of the King, who she truly loves as a husband.  The movie finishes with her triumphant, her uncle, Mordecai, taking an important post in the empire, and the Jew's enemy, Haman, hung.

The plot is based on the Bible, and is portrayed very well; one of the better screenplay adaptations from the Bible this decade.  The cinematography is also excellent; both the architecture of Susa and the visual shots remind me of the city of Gondor from the LOTR movies.  The soundtrack is average, and is often unnoticeable, which is unfortunate as a Biblical epic such as this should have great music to go along with it.  The biggest failing was the casting; nearly all the characters were either American, English or Indian.  Most of the actors and actresses were either too light skinned (American or English) or too dark skinned (Indian).  This is unfortunate and unnecessary as there is a fairly large number of professional actors and actresses from Iran, Turkey, Israel and other Middle East countries that could have been casted here.  Even worse is that many of the accents clearly sound 21st century American.  I did not expect this movie to follow Gibson's Passion of the Christ and be filmed in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic.  But I did expect the characters to converse in sentences more reminiscent of the Bible than of a modern school-play.

Another minus of this film is that the dialogue often discusses the themes of democracy versus monarchy, and how the Persians always swear by monarchy and are opposed to democracy, which is what their enemies, the Greeks, practice.  Seeing that this movie came out in 2006, I somehow suspect that members of the Bush administration or the US Republican Party leaned on Fox (fair and balanced) to produce a movie deploring Iran (modern-day Persia) and upholding Western society (Greeks and Jews).  This inclusion of democracy vs monarchy in the dialogue made it seem fake; the very concept of democracy would not have entered the minds of the Persian empire as Greek was an aristocracy; only land-holding males had a say in government.

Still, with all of its failings, the movie made for good entertainment, but not worth watching more than once.",1176163200,3,3300,4.690972222222222

2674471,3,B000JJSJO6,"I applaud this movie as presenting a tale of a strong woman of God who changed the fate of her people.  It's also noteworthy in that it portrays one many historical accounts of anti-semitism and persectuion.

Visually the movie's satisfactory, though a bit too polished.  The acting is fine, but hardly Oscar-caliber.  The big problem with the movie is the script.  It is not crystal clear from Book of Esther, but the historical/biblical Esther seems stronger, braver, more confident than the movie Esther who reluctantly approaches her husband, King Xerxes, to plead the blood of the Jews.  King Xerxes seems wimpy and easily swayed and controlled by others.  (Contrast this with the god-king Xerxes of 300.)  The biblical account is more enjoyable and enthralling.

One Night with the King has some value.  It's a great way to introduce children or folks not familiar with the Bible to a great Bible story.  It's fun to watch and is a very pleasant love story.  It's just too syrupy-sweat and lacks punch.",1175990400,3,1008,4.899408284023669

her people. That is still the main point of the movie, but for me it opened into a more real story, with true, genuine, God-honoring love.

No romance before marriage(kissing, getting all over each other,etc.).

2674473,5,B000JJSJO6,"ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING: I had started to give this film four stars, but after writing this review decided that -- ""warts and all"" -- it deserves five.

The film starts with a narrative and scenes that remind the viewer that the stage was set for the Book of Esther hundreds of years prior, as King Saul's rebellion against God (itself as the sin of witchcraft) bore evil fruit for many, many generations, and affected whole nations.

Actor Peter O'Toole as Samuel the prophet confronts King Saul about the king's disobedience and then swiftly kills King Agag himself.  The scriptural account is much more graphic, ""...Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.""  (ISa 15:33).  Those who may think they want absolute scriptural accuracy in such films may want to reconsider their position.  As a mother and grandmother, I appreciate being able to sit down and enjoy a film with my entire family (currently from 2 to 82) and not having to shield the little ones' eyes, while at the same time having the door opened to discussing these matters in greater depth in a place and time that suits our family.  I don't expect Christian films to do all that for us.  The film puts across well enough that there are consequences for disobedience, rebellion against God, for sin, and that it does not please God for us to give quarter to His enemies, to those self-identified as His enemies, and I appreciate the director's discretion in filming this and other scenes.

The orphan Hadassah is presented as a spunky young woman, full of fun and life, yet full of depth.  She is aware of and clearly unashamed of her outer beauty; however, she places far more value on her inner beauty.  By way of flashbacks to her childhood and a precious birthday present her parents had lovingly given her, the viewer is given a glimpse into the ""line upon line, precept upon precept"" manner in which such strength of character was developed in this delightful young woman.  This, in turn, leads the viewer to cherish a culture -- still with us today -- that has such rich and robust roots, thousands of years deep.  What a wonder!  We find a young woman who is not in any manner preoccupied with herself, but one who delights in delighting others.  Who could help but love such a one as she?

Hadassah is affectionate with her cousin Mordecai, who is raising her as his own daughter.  She is yielded to his authority, yet openly persuasive.  After engaging in some intellectual ""fencing,"" he ultimately yields to her when she presents her case in terms he simply cannot resist.  This sets up beautifully for what follows: her hard-won victory (permission to go to Jerusalem) is thwarted by King Ahasuerus' efforts to find a new queen.  Mordecai gives her a new name (Esther), charges her to not disclose her kindred, and they both prepare for what comes next in faith, not (undue) fear.

Esther is taken to the king's house, to the custody of (the eunuch) Hegai, keeper of the women, where the viewer finds the admonition and example to not merely accept, but to embrace one's lot.  Esther does so, immersing herself wholly -- mind, body, soul and spirit -- in preparation for her bridegroom.  The relationship, the love, between Esther and Hegai is tenderly developed in this film, and Hegai's role in developing the love between the King and Esther is likewise presented.

In keeping with scripture, we find Esther on her one night with the king requiring nothing but that which Hegai appointed (and what he appoints is an astounding, yet believable representation of how God works through people, believers or not).  The king is presented as wrestling with a kaleidescope of emotions.  He tests Esther by asking her what she would do if he were to offer her his kingdom, for example.  She answers, and by the expressions on each of their faces, the trembling of each of their voices, and the way the king catches his breath -- as though their eyes' meeting is almost more than he can take -- the viewer realizes that this is the point at which both are utterly slain, at which their love is consummated, at which they have become one forever, and they have not even touched each other!  They do touch then, discreetly disappearing behind a veil, and the rest is left to the viewer's imagination, as it should be.

In the Book of Esther (2:15) we are informed that ""Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.""  In keeping with the purpose, scope and intent of the entirety of scriptures, including the entire Book of Esther, this film makes clear that Esther was outwardly beautiful, true, but inwardly even more beautiful as she was wholly her lord's (the king's, as his queen and wife) and wholly the LORD's (Yahweh's) at the same time, there being no conflict or mutual exclusivity  between the two as she waited in, rested in, and lived in the will of the Most High God. This is why she found favor with all who looked upon her, as her inner beauty shone through her outer beauty and she lived in full surrender to her LORD and her lord.

Ultimately, Queen Esther has the courage to stand alone, wholly alone, and intercede for her people, surrendering herself completely with the words, ""...if I perish, I perish.""  There are some heart-stopping moments in regard to the manner in which Esther arrives, unbidden, before the king and just how close she comes to losing her life at that moment.

The film in its entirety, including the denouement from that point on covers the account well enough to earn this film a place in my family's film library.  I find in this film a rich source of inspiration for further dialog regarding the Most High God we serve, including the wonders of His grace!  Truly, His Name is Wonderful!",1175731200,2,5744,4.669314796425025
2674474,4,B000JJSJO6,"I would like everyone to carefully read this. Although this movie is said to be from the book ""Haddassah"" I would like to take this opportunity to point out otherwise. I have a novel called ""Esther"" by Nathaniel Weinreb written back in the 1950's-- a book i highly recommend. I have not read Hadassah, but I was very startled when I was told the above, and found after watching the movie that not only is the plot of the movie virtually identical to ""Esther"" but also many many of the actual lines are verbatim in the movie from the book. The swatstika, the King a sculptor theme, the Esther reading from the scroll for the King, the Haman speech, Haman's affinity with Admanta, the apology to Memucan and plot to kill Memucan which Haman turned it to Kill Admanta, the buying of poison from the Jew whom Mordecai throttled for doing it, the love and fight btwn Esther and the King, Esther seeking out the king in the library... it's all in ""Esther"". I highly suspect that the writers HAD to have read this book.
Having said that... I was disappointed with the banquets, however the fainting thing is probably authentic as Josephus mentions it in his chronicles. [...].",1175558400,,1169,4.598086124401914

2674477,5,B000JJSJO6,"With lush cinematography and with a fantastic score, One Night With the King will leave you mesmerized. Based off the book ""Hadassah"" by authors Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olson, the movie has an all star cast with Tiffany Dupont as Hadassah and later as Esther, the incredibly handsome Luke Goss as King Xerxes, John Rhys-Davies as Mordecai, and brief apperances by Omar Sharif and in my opinion we see to little of the wonderful Peter O'Toole.

King Xerxes after dismissing his first wife is pressed by the other princes of his provinces to pick another bride to hold the kingdom together while he is off warring against the Greeks. It doesn't take long for the king to realize that Esther who is jewish but is hiding it, not only has the will to do what she wants, but she also has the power over his heart. After they marry things start to slowly fall apart, mainly by the man Haman the Agagite. Soon the state decrees that all Jews should be put to death so King Xerxes will have enough gold to cover the cost of the war with the Greeks, which soon leaves Esther's life in danger. Defying the warnings of others, Esther struggles to save her people even though it may end up costing her her life. Will Esther struggles be in vain, or will King Xerxes realize the error of his decision and does he have the courage and the faith to believe in his wife as she struggles to find out just how far she will go to fullfill her destiny.",1175472000,,1436,4.398496240601504

Some harsh critics seem disturbed that it isn't a literal translation, but the essential elements of the plot are dramatically delivered in this inspiring and well-done work. Tiffany Dupont is gorgeous and gains audience empathy as she fits the image one would expect of Esther to a tee.

Luke Goss is a believable King Xerxes. He is tough, focused, and authoritative, without being overly offensive. Omar Sharif adds a Middle East flavor to the work and Tommy Lister ideally plays the role of Hegai. Although the film was shot in India, it has an ancient mystical ""feel"" to it visually that gives the appearance that one is being transported centuries back in time.

Mordecai's advice to Esther still rings true, i.e., that if she doesn't allow God to do His work through her, the work will still be done, but who is to say that perhaps she was born for such a time as this. The screenwriter captured the essence of Esther's decision when he had her deliver the lines, ""if I perish, I perish.""

The King mumbled and the story line does not follow The Book of Esther, which makes a good story on its' own without the added plots.

The film has a few relatively minor embellishments, which mainly serve to fill out the shorter, fast paced Biblical account - but these are mainly in keeping with the spirit and moral of the story.

A great rendition, recommended for the whole family!",1174694400,,400,4.619718309859155
2674485,1,B000JJSJO6,"Going in,I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, I just couldn't. There are the petty things, like the cheesy acting; there are the cultural things - I think they were operating out of a King Arthur framework rather than an Ancient Persian one; there are the petty things - the ways they changed the biblical story to better fit the movie plot (adding in a war, taking out the second banquet, the marital strife between the king and queen); there are the irritating ones - such as all sorts of back stories that added nothing to the plot and only complicated it; but it was at a deeper level that I lost it.

The story as written in the Bible would make a great movie as it is. It has grit, it has passion, it has intrigue, it has irony, it has beauty and pageantry (it has sex!). Often, what isn't said in the story is as important as what is said. But this move turns a great work of literature into just one more Christian Romance novel, a'la Brock and Bodie Thoene (and if you think they write great literature, then we need to have another conversation).

For some reason, Christian authors and move makers have no idea how to be subtle. How to trust the reader to pick up on the point without actually saying it. So they turn too quickly to moralizing, to explaining everything, to over-spiritualizing things. The book of Esther never even mentions God. But this movie throws God into the forefront, as if to say ""LOOK! THIS IS ABOUT GOD! BET YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT, DID YOU? YEP! IT'S ABOUT GOD!""  Good art asks good questions, and often points you in the right direction. Bad art throws the answer right in your face, as if you can't think for yourself.

So, yes, I was irritated by this move. Throw in a few obvious cultural faux pas, such as turning Haman into a Nazi, using the Star of David (a much more recent symbol) as a central plot device, and having a Jewish girl refer to God as Father (a NT addition), then do the opposite of the real story (Haman mocking Esther rather than actually fearing for his life) and I'm not sure I'd advise people see it. I don't want my kids confusing this sham for the real thing. And I certainly don't want people to confuse this for a ""great"" movie. It wasn't horrible, really. Just. . .not that good. Disappointing.",1174608000,39,2268,4.405727923627685
2674486,2,B000JJSJO6,"The character of Esther is a powerful example of how God orchestrates seemingly random events for good.  Esther becomes an unlikely queen through the rash decision of the Persian king to summon and dismiss his wife and a ""sexual"" contest to pick a new wife.  In the story, elements such as the villain Haman, Esther's cousin Mordecai, and a ""random"" casting of lots to determine when Haman's plan to slaughter the Jewish people come together to illustrate the triumph of good over evil.  I've taught this book in church and find the story to be compelling.

That being said, this film is a pure disappointment.  The acting is mediocre and the character development is weak.  I find the biggest fault with the portrayal of King Xerxes.  Being a ruler must be a difficult job, but Xerxes in the movie acts more like a teenager than the leader of one of the greatest ancient empires.  Especially troubling is the scene where he tells Esther that she is his Jacob while he wants to be her Rachel.  Ok, it's great that he's presumably secure enough to talk this this, but this is horrible scriptwriting at best.  Esther in this movie looks like she is high on drugs a good portion of the time.  When she decides not to escape from the palace with her ex-boyfriend, who tragically was castrated to become a eunuch, based on the reasoning that trials were given by God for a good reason, I just rolled my eyes.

When I was watching this movie with my wife, I was thinking to myself that this type of moviemaking must be attributed to some overly feminized Christian undergraduate film school type advised by James Dobson.  There is absolutely no grit in this movie at all.",1174608000,5,1665,4.603389830508474

2674498,4,B000JJSJO6,"The scenery and story was the saving grace of this film. The acting was well done, as best as could be expected from the ensemble. Some scenes seemed forced, but overall the story carried on nicely. My one real complaint is that the love between King Xerxes and Esther seemed short coming, one minute their talking and the next he is saying how madly in love he is. Love at first sight and all that, but come on. The reality of their love grew from that the scene, but its first mentioning didn't seem realistic at all. From there the film recovered and, despite a few ""hocky"" (sp.) moments, it was great. Such moments included, unfortunately, the near ending with Xerxes saying, ""I saw the stars."" It reveals his love for her, but still just a tad hocky.

I would, regardless, recommend this film. It may stray from the actual story of Esther in some ways, but it a wonderful interpretation of the ancient tale, making it relatable to today's world. The climax of the movie with Esther breaking all protocols and risking her life to save her people is very moving and shows the inner turmoil that this young woman had to go through to reach this pivotal decision. It's a great movie as long as you don't think to hard about some of the incongruences.",1174176000,2,1251,4.511013215859031

I believe it got the point through that God has a plan for everyone especially when we are confronted with a conflict that we know not how to solve.

On a lighter note, I'm young, 17-years-old, and I just want to say that King Xerxes is hot!  Woo!

Though at times hokey (the king wears a lot of make-up and there are several gratuitous muscle scenes that made me laugh), the artistic license used to create and develop the relationship between the king and Esther is great.  I loved the historical prelude--never knew where Haman (may his name be blotted out!) came from.  I also liked the movie's portrayal of pride in the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The scene of the queen walking through the king's court is intense!  The movie departs from the Biblical account here and there, but so what!  Hopefully, after watching, the viewer will be motivated to open up the Bible and read the story itself.

2674517,4,B000JJSJO6,"There's a handful of stories and events that just bed to be made into a movie. The biblical book of Esther is one of them. It's got all the elements of a story to be eaten: romance, intrigue, action, and even a little comedy.

""One Night with the King"" is actually based on a novel, based on the biblical account. As such, it's already a little skewed from the start. Some of the changes are acceptable, like Esther's childhood sweetheart following her into the palace (though I thought eunuchs were made at early childhood, not near adulthood.)

Other changes weren't so palatable. King Xerxes is portrayed in a far more sympathetic light than the real man deserved. Queen Vashti's defiance is not known for certain, but it wasn't an anti-war protest. Haman's relationship was portrayed as antagonistic to Esther, but the biblical account implies he was more than pleased to be the guest of honor at her parties.

The history is tied in all right. Xerxes's motivation was to conqueor Greece, and it was good to portray Haman making false charges of allying the Jews and the Greeks together. Of course, it's the Greeks who eventually bring down the Persians.

The acting overall is pretty good. Omar Sharif and John Rhys-Davis, of course, are always great, and I see good things ahead for Tiffany Dupont. And I've always liked Tom Lister Jr. (he's got the look of a man who'd be nice to the girls, but break a leg for the king.)

The worst elements, however, are the direction, which got clunky and choppy, especially toward the end. Lay off the dramatic drums, please, especially when changing camera angles. And the ""climax"" with the magic amulet, and ""I saw the stars,"" ewww, I still cringe at that.",1173398400,3,1702,4.717171717171717

The 2 problems I had with this movie were: 1) The quality of the sound was terrible.  I had to hold the remote in my hand and constantly throughout the movie press volume up and volume down.  By the middle of the movie, I was annoyed with the sound quality to where I probably didn't appreciate the movie as much as I might have if the sound was better.  Sometimes, I had to rewind parts to hear what was actually said.  2) The other thing that I didn't care for was that it sometimes deviated from the story in the Bible.  Parts were inserted I guess to make it a better movie.  But the story of Esther is romantic and fascinating enough without having to add things into it.  For example, the King was returning home from a battle and anxious to see his bride Esther.  He caught her giving her Uncle a hug.  The king did not know this man and assumed Esther had a lover, which created turmoil in the relationship.  The story took a turn and started to evolve from this particular scene, which is not in the Bible and we do not know it to be true.  Hardships continue as a result of this mishap and towards the end of the movie it finally starts getting back on track.

Personally, the untruth/additions to the accuracy of what we know from the Bible ruined the movie for me.  I sold my copy the next day with no interest in seeing it again.",1173312000,,1472,4.207142857142857

This movie brings life to characters that many people have read/heard about.  It brings an emotional and human aspect to the story that you don't necessarily get when reading it in the Bible.

I have heard someone complain about Hollywood taking some poetic license with the story and frankly, they do that with all their movies that are based on books or actual events.  The movie sticks very close to what is described in the Bible, even if it is an intepretation of what the movie makers think happened.

Since Hollywood loves to change stories to begin with (sometimes out of necessity since film doesn't allow the detail of a book) and since this movie was made from a book which was made from the original, it bears little resemblance to the original story.  Reminds me of the old gossip game where one person whispers in another's ear who then whispers in the next person's ear, etc. until the final quote is not at all what was said in the beginning.

2674539,2,B000JJSJO6,"If only Christians would stand up and realize the authority and gifts already available in them. Not unlike Queen Esther (the main character in One Night With the King), Christian filmmakers are afraid to step into their full potential as artists. In ""One Night With The King"", this is obvious. Instead of setting trends, instead of being the ones to be copied, the makers of One Night With The King opted to go with the flow, as it were. They opted to hire some brilliantly talented actors, hand them a very weak and chaotic script, put them under a mediocre director, overwhelm them with over-the-top fairy-tale, unrealistic scenery and sets, and, to top it all off, make sure that, again, this epic motion picture about a story in the Bible is totally inaccurate, inept, inane, and ineffective.

This movie drills hard focus on the romance of Hadassah (Esther) and the King. Nowhere in the Bible is a romance of this magnitude even suggested. This movie has Hadassah showing substantially more passion for her king than for her own people, the Hebrews (Jews), the very people she was put on the earth to save ""for such a time as this"". The storyline in this movie is not only inaccurate, but very confusing as well. I know the book of Esther from the Bible, and this movie had me scratching my head as it aimlessly meandered around for the first hour. The scenery and sets (many CG creations) were reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and nothing resembling any real life locations either present or past. The one and only redeeming scene in the movie is when John Rhys-Davies is briefly seen ripping his garments in agony, and this scene quickly goes past almost unexplained.

If Christians are going to make films, it is far past time for them to be the trendsetters and not copycats. It is time for them to honor God by creating films that accurately portray stories in the Bible as they are told in the Bible. Since when does God need embellishment? Isn't His Word good enough? After all, it is He, the Supreme Being, Who wrote those stories, Who walked with the people in those stories, and Who redeemed them in their most desperate times of need. Why then, change the facts just to pander to an audience. I do believe that the Lord is the One Who knows exactly what we need to see and hear. It is time for Christian filmmakers to leave the stories as they are, and to create new forms of art and special effects to portray some of the amazing wonders that God performed, and still performs.

During the Renaissance period it was Christian artists, composers, poets, etc. that set the trends. It was the secular artists that tried their best to mimic the art of those who were honoring their Lord with their art. The world was the copycat in the arts in those days, and that's the way it should always be. Quit trying to ape the fools. Seek the Lord for guidance, and let His Holy Spirit use you to create mind-boggling, heart-changing, awe inspiring motion pictures (and other forms of art) that turn the world right-side-up and bring people to JESUS. After all, isn't that why we're here? We're commanded to love, not to judge. We're commanded to love, not to entertain. We're commanded to love, not to copy. If we let Him love through us, everything we do will be attractive and effective in JESUS' Kingdom.

Hadassah changes her name to Esther to hide her Jewish ancestry. She truly falls in love with the King, but she must stand up to him and risk her own life to save her People. Wonderful cinematography and screenplay.

2674546,1,B000JJSJO6,"Many of the reviewers here who gave less than 3 stars, were honest in their comments.  My family was glad we could actually see a movie without trash of immoral sexuality, without profanities, and something that generically pursued a Biblical account.  But liberty was taken with the Biblical account of Esther, for sure!  This is more of a romance-novel style telling of Esther. Playing w/ the Text...is something we don't like, though we don't mind filling-in-the unknown blanks type moments.  We don't like it when commentators/authors tried to ""help God's story line out a bit with more pep & spice for a 'better story'.""

Yes, errors were made, and too much liberty was taken at times with the Text.  As one reviewer wrote, you really don't need to spice up the true Biblical account of the Book of Esther...it stands out for itself as FULL of all kinds of spice!

We saw this at the theatre, a rarity to go to movies that are ""safe"" for Biblical families.  We bought this for home, but later regreted it and tossed it.  The spirituality is SO lacking in this film, it's more of a hero-cinderella-bad guy film with ""Biblical tones.""  The spirituality of the actors, who are supposed to be talking to the God of Israel, is very weak.  Haman is a bit commical, in his evil approach (intentional, apparently).

Finally, we RECOMMEND a MUCH MORE Biblically accurate (very close) movie on Purim, from ""The Bible"" series films.  The one in particular that tells this Biblical account, and is quite enjoyable and authentic feeling, and spiritual, is ""The Bible - Esther (2000).""  If you buy that version, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.  But getting the ""One Night With The King"" version isn't a complete loss for family enjoyement and Biblical reminders....just don't expect complete accuracy.  The Bible - Esther version, though, is very enjoyably accurate and rewarding!  Get it instead!",1172880000,9,1883,4.889589905362776
2674547,5,B000JJSJO6,"I've always thought the book of Esther would make a great basis for a movie, and I throughally enjoyed watching this inspiring, touching story of a crisis between love and faith. The filming blew me away, it is so beautifully done, and all the actors filled their parts well. I liked the Bible quotations. They found places in the story very naturally -- not as though they were ""sprinkled in"" to make it Christian. Giving the head-eunich a mojor role was a good move: I've often thought when reading the book of Esther, ""If they were going to make a movie, something could really be done with this character."" Esther is potrayed as cheerful and lighthearted through the first part of the movie, and perhaps a bit too giddy as some reviewers have pointed out, but this serves as a good contrast to how her faith deepens as the grave responsibilities of her position settle down on her. Mordiciah narrarates the story, but, dissapointingly, is given a somewhat minor role otherwise. The soundtrack is flawlessly clear -- lots of rich, ethnical sounding music and pounding drums. This movie isn't for everyone, though, and there are parts of it I think could have been done better myself. It should be understood that this is not a dramitization of the Book of Esther, but rather someone's artistic idealization of it. The plot differs from the bibical account in many places, and when it does, it sometimes just makes the story harder to believe. There are also some historical diviations. According to the customs of that time, the queen was always veiled in mixed company, but we can't very well hide Tiffany Duponts lovely face through half of the show, now can we? And if I understand the bibical way of putting it, ""in the evening she shall go in, and in the morning she shall come out,"" those girls that went to see the King *spent the night* with him. That is a really delicate thing to depict in film modestly -- just don't sit down with this movie thinking this is all according to the Bible and the way they did things back then. Read Esther, and enjoy watching this if you aren't a stickler for word for word realism. Warm and romantic, with pathos and poetry -- an artful and inspiring drama.",1172793600,2,2203,4.622448979591836
2674548,5,B000JJSJO6,"This movie is excellent- it brings the book of Esther alive while using powerful imagination and strong historic knowledge to fill in the places that the Bible does not give us specifics on.

I highly recommend this movie for your home collection...even better after you read the book ""Hadassah.""",1172793600,,419,4.726027397260274
2674549,2,B000JJSJO6,"The Biblical story of Esther is a tremendous tale of courage and faith, and could make a great movie.  This isn't that movie.

Although ""One Night With the King"" is blessed with a far larger production budget than most Christian films, the bigger bucks do not translate into a compelling story.  Based on a novel (not just the Biblical book of Esther), the script changes the story too much.  I'm willing to grant a certain amount of artistic license to fill in some of the details, but the screenwriters have actually CHANGED important parts of the story.  Haman's appearance at Esther's banquet gets completely turned on its head.  Instead of begging for his life, he mocks and insults her!  The writers also threw in a Jewish love interest to further ""improve"" the story.  Of course, his being made a eunuch (ouch!) didn't help his chances.

In addition, this production glosses over the fact that Esther was part of a harem.  I doubt that she spent her ""One Night With the King"" reading him boring documents from the Persian archives as this film presents!  Obviously the producers wanted this to be family-friendly entertainment, but there must have been SOME creative way to portray Esther's true situation without being tawdry.

I thought the performances were pretty good, although Tiffany Dupont portrays Esther as some kind of flighty airhead in the first part of the movie.  When she becomes the queen her performance improves, though, and it's at least conceivable that Xerxes would view her as more than just a sex object.  I guess the fact that the movie portrays her competition for the king's affection as a bunch of total nitwits helped, too (one of those ""bad date"" montages popular in romantic comedies would have been a hoot here).

The musical score was good, and so was the CGI -- most of the time.  The panoramic shots of the city looked awesome (though probably not historically accurate) but some of the sweeping shots of the Persian army encampment had that ""drawn"" look.

Alas, despite decent production values it's story and characters that make or break a movie, and ""One Night With the King"" falls way short on that score.",1172620800,2,2152,4.820163487738419

2674551,1,B000JJSJO6,"I was quite shocked after viewing this DVD. The story is wrenched, filled with fantasy and magic, nothing near the original story.

The Esther in this story has a special necklace (amulet/talisman) that shines stars of David when light strikes it. She loses it and gets it back a few times in the story. This special necklace is what finally comes to her rescue. If they really wanted to squiggle this shining light effect in, they should have thought up something with the urim and thumim.

To me it's pure paganism. Although you don't see her literally worshiping the thing, she does often grasp it when afraid. An idol, no matter how small is still an idol. I would recommend the ""Bible Series"" version of Esther, which is very good.

I give it one star because at least there aren't lengthy love scenes. Some ""bible"" movies like to stretch the amount of human flesh shown to the uttermost limit. This one is moderate in that aspect.",1172448000,5,936,4.626506024096385

2674556,5,B000JJSJO6,"This movie is not only visually stunning, but it shows that true love surpasses all. I know it's a biblical story, but no other has touched me the way this one did. I guess a lot of people missed the point. See, in the end, it didn't  matter whether Hadassah was a jew or a gentile because The King loved her anyway despite her trying to hide it. It's about standing up for what you believe in no matter the consequences. It's about having enough courage, pride, and bravado to rise up against protocol and/or a whole nation to defend your heritage and your people no matter the cost. Hadassah could've been a coward, keep up her charade, and let all the Jews get slaughtered, but she chose to stand up even if that meant she would parrish. Courage like that no longer exists in the world today. People only want movies about drugs, sex, and violence. Don't get me wrong, that's cool too, but every now and then it's refreshing to see a movie that pushes the envelope. That makes you think, that makes you feel glad, or take pride in something other than meaningless sex and killing. Whether you know the biblical story or not this is a great love story. Frankly, it's just an awesome story all the way around. Trust me, it's very hard to keep my Husband awake to watch anything I like to watch, but he loved this movie also, and he was just as moved as I was.  It's about a very beautiful Jewish woman named Hadassah who later becomes the biblical Esther, Queen of Persia. Hadassah is snatched up and forced to become a candidate for King Xerxes who is about to take a bride. Once Hadassah is captured her father tells her it is best to conceal her identity and call herself Esther. The woman formerly known as Hadassah manages to win The King's heart by letting him know that it's not his Crown, his title, or his riches that matters most because she would rather have his heart more than any of those things. This jesture touches The King and he takes her to be his bride falling deeply in love with her. Hadassah (Esther) is then married into wealth and privledge meanwhile she's hiding who she really is from The King. Of course, there's always greed stricken people that wanna overthrow The King for their own selfish purposes. At any rate, to prevent from revealing every single detail which would spoil the whole entire movie, and to cut this short. The King is about to leave and appoint the wrong person as his successor because he has only on thing on the brain..eradicating all the Jews! At this point Hadassah has a decision to make. She could forget who she is and let her people suffer the consequences, or she could expose herself to The King and beg for her life, her father's life, and the life of her people. Showing great courage and bravery she decides to stand and let her true identity be known. Of course, there's now a choice to be made..Does The King let her live? or Does The King let her die? or Does he love he enough not to care who or what she is? I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to see this movie.",1172016000,7,3036,4.400355871886121
2674567,2,B000JJSJO6,"The bare skeleton of the plot of the biblical book of Esther is in this movie. Actually, they ended much closer to the original story than I thought they would. However, they added so much to the story that at times it was hard to recognize. Yes, they took a beautiful dramatic, but very short story in the Bible and stretched it into a very long movie. At times, it seemed like an eternity. However, there are some good points. Esther use of the stories of the Bible was very good. Some of the scenes were actually touching.

It was a good try, but they took too many liberties with the story, historical facts, and the CGI. A seminary student should go through this story and point out all the historical inacurracies. That is a little sad. However, they did try to place the story in its historical context, which I did enjoy.  The dialog at times creaked and at times soared. I don't know if I recommend the movie, but the producers' hearts were in the right place.",1171929600,3,969,4.407821229050279
2674568,1,B000JJSJO6,It starts out with things that wasn't in the Bible then proceeds to continue with more things not in the Bible.  I didn't even finish the movie.,1171929600,3,144,4.333333333333333
2674569,1,B000JJSJO6,"The acting in this movie is atrocious.  John Ryhs-Davies, Omar Sharif, and Peter O'Toole (all ten seconds of on-screen time) are great.  Everyone else seems to not know their motivation or what to do with their hands.  If they need to express an emotion, then they must overact.  But it's not all their fault.  The lines the actors are given are commensurate with their abilities.  And those are just the lines I could understand- most of the time there was such an avalanche of mumbling it's a wonder the actors are speaking English.

It's sad, really.  If there's any Biblical story screaming to be made into a movie, full of drama and intrigue, it's the story of Esther.  Many times those ancient stories from 5,000 years ago are hard for the modern person to relate to, instilled with the value of the novel as we are.  But Esther reads like a novel.  You really wouldn't have to change much to make it into a good movie.

Thus when Michael Sajbel decided to change nearly everything, he came up with a really really bad movie that makes no sense.  For some reason stars of David appear and are the crucial denouement- at the sacrifice of the most dramatic moment in the original story.  Now there is suddenly a deep desire of everyone to return to Jerusalem, the holy city, and the bad guys actually carry swastikas!  (Or perhaps the director was trying to link up the ancient Hindu symbol with evil?)  Honestly, as horrible as the Holocaust was, is it necessary to read such historical anachronisms into the original story?  One begins to suspect an agenda to bring modern Zionist elements into the story to make it appear that such elements have always been the part of the Jewish history, to support that particular cause.

Evidently viewers aren't sophisticated enough to handle the culture and values of the people in the original story, so we have two new love stories added in.  Since we don't want to hear about Jews killing tens of thousands of their enemies, that's left out of the script, though present in the original story.  Since we can't relate to a Middle Eastern woman, Esther suddenly has the feminist sensibilities of a modern Western woman.  Since the idea of a king bedding numerous concubines in order to choose a wife is unpalatable, the script goes out of it's way to show that King Xerxes is faithful.  Of course to do this, they have to come up with arguments between Esther and Xerxes that are so convoluted and unreal that they are worthy of a sitcom, but certainly not real life.

The movie isn't even internally consistent.  The original Israeli slaughter of the Ammonites (men, women, and children) is almost excused as appropriate at the beginning of the movie, in order to show the Israelis in a better light.  Yet such actions are typical of the times.  Then later the Persians blanch at the idea of killing women and children themselves, as if that were a common belief of the period.  So the earlier genocide is excused on a modern ethical level, and no attention is paid to the historically nuanced norms of the time.

I'm sad I wasted two hours of my life watching this.  All the money they put into set design didn't excuse the papacity of talent that went into this film.  (And even here, when they show the actual village of Ait Benhaddou in Morocco as a great city, the CGI additions are woefully obvious.)  If you want a good story, I'd recommend you instead to the Jewish story of Esther in the Torat/Old Testament, where incidentally the Jews are the heroes.  There's a story with drama and great characters.",1171929600,18,3559,4.635782747603834
2674570,2,B000JJSJO6,"I didn't do an in-depth study on when the Star of David started showing up as Jewish symbol,  but a quick trip to Wikipedia before writing this review turned up the information that no archeological proof exists of the use of the Star of David in the Kingdom of Israel BCE,  or the years BC for those of us who were in school before everyone got so squeamish about the use of anything that smacks of ""religion.""  The same source also reads that the earliest record of the use of the star is found in the 3-4th century AD (CE,  blah blah), on the arch of an ancient synagogue found in Galilee.  So this entire movie is based on a gimmick that isn't really accurate.  It makes it look like the king got mad at Haman simply because of seeing a bunch of stars float around during a banquet,  instead of realizing that his trusted advisor had planned to wipe out an entire nation for no good reason.

  The Biblical story of Esther is so exciting and so complete that it doesn't need the silly additions found in this movie.  Had someone used the Old Testament as the sole source of research,  there would have been plenty to make a decent movie.

  I also had a problem with the Jewish males being rounded up and made into eunuchs while the females were being rounded up as beauty pageant contestants.  Hadassah's friend Jesse wouldn't have been so eager to run off to Jerusalem after being castrated,  as Biblical law forbids the entrance into the temple of any Jewish man who has been ""injured in his stones.""  I have read in one historical account that conquering countries had a problem when turning Jewish men into eunuchs,  as they would often commit suicide when castrated rather than lose their right to worship as a Jewish man.  This account said that often a man who was seen to be Jewish would be left intact or killed outright,  rather than castrated,  as it would often result in the suicide of an otherwise valuable slave.  I'm not sure if that is accurate,  but this movie could have left out the whole Jesse plot,  since he looked like a boy band member anyway.

  Read the Biblical account of Esther,  and you'll find a powerful story that stays with you longer than this rather silly movie,  although I do appreciate any film made that acknowledges that many people still have faith in this day and age.",1171843200,5,2317,4.473684210526316

2674588,4,B000JJSJO6,"Before anything else, I must say that I've read the Biblical book of Esther but NOT the book ""Haddassah"" by Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen on which this film is based.  With that said, I'll treat this film as just another love story and not an interpretation of the Biblical story of Esther, which does vary from this film quite a bit.

The story revolves around Haddassah (Tiffany Dupont), the lovely, wholesome Jewish daughter of Mordecai (the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies), a scribe for King Xerxes (Luke Goss).  Early in the film, Xerxes ""removes"" his queen from power through the meddling of Prince Admantha (John Noble) and Haman (wickedly fun James Callis), both of which have their own delusions of grandeur in mind.  Soon after, Xerxes goes on a quest to find a new queen to replace is ""removed"" one.  Women throughout all the kingdom are taken to the king's palace and treated to all the wonders and niceties one would expect from the King of Persia.  Eventually Xerxes falls for Haddassah (who's changed her name to the less Jewish-sounding Esther, for protection).  While the two are falling for each other, Admantha and Haman are both putting their own plans for taking the kingdom into motion.  One of those plans involves the destruction of all Jews in the kingdom.  With both men attempting to convince Xerxes of their own plans, Esther has to stop the destruction of her people.  If you're familiar with the Bible's version of ""Esther,"" you already know how this tale ends.

Were liberties taken with the story? Yes, many in fact.  Does it destroy the story of Esther?  Absolutely not.  This is a very good film with a wonderful cast.  Unlike others, I failed to see the poor acting of the performers in this movie.  Dupont did an excellent job of portraying Esther as a kindhearted and very loving person.  John Rhys-Davies was fun as Mordecai, both proud and protective.  Callis was probably my favorite of the bunch, portraying the double-crossing and vengeful Haman with vigor.  Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister played Hegai, the Royal Eunuch in a loving manner.  I feel that he loved Esther like a sister as much as Xerxes loved her as a wife.

I found no problem with the sound quality.  I understood every word very clearly.  Secondly, the visuals, especially the CGI created palace, were wonderful.  The colors in this film hearkened back to the days of the old technicolor bright, popping colors that have long faded from many memories.

Overall, I highly recommend this film as a wonderful love story.  Are there better films out there that are Biblically based?  You bet.  But as far as love stories go, this is one of the best in the last ten years.",1171238400,113,2674,4.754347826086956
2674589,5,B000JJSJO6,"I _loved_ Tiffany Dupont and Luke Goss in the lead roles. And, as a woman of a certain age, I was delighted to see Omar Sharif, who's work I've admired since his starring role in Dr. Zhivago. I saw ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING the first weekend it came out and I would have paid the admission price again if there had been a later showing and I could have stayed to watch it again. I've seen some reviews that found production values lacking, but I can't speak to that. The movie looked fine to me as far as photography and all that. For me, a movie is all about the characters and the script and the story. What stood out for me was the performances. Tiffany Dupont's Esther is such a sweet, modest young woman who is cast into fearful circumstances and shows courage despite her fear because she knows she is the only hope of her people. Her Esther is absolutely dazzled by King Xerxes. This is something you don't get from the original Book of Esther, and perhaps that's why some readers question the script. In the Bible, Esther is clearly sacrificing herself as a duty to use her position as Queen to save her people. Dupont's Esther adores all the pomp of the court and the beautiful clothes and jewels as any young girl would. Besides, Luke Goss's Xerxes is quite dazzling. He is very appealing -- OK, he's _gorgeous_ and conveys that aura of the exotic one would expect to see in a Persian king -- yet the character as written displays all the flaws of the Bible's King Xerxes. To me the characters were very complex and satisfying. I adored the lavish sets and the gorgeous costumes. I felt as if I were in the Ancient Near East. For me, it recalls the great Biblical epics of decades ago. I highly recommend this DVD, especially now that Border's has it at such a good price. I actually paid the list price for this at the store when it first came out because I wanted it right away, and I don't regret it a bit.

Yes it is loosely based on the Ester in the bible, but I felt the actors and actresses portrayed them extremely well. This movie gets those that have never heard the story interested in not just this story but others as well. The story was well written and the scenes where magnificent.

My only problem was the story line, so much diffent from book of which I read three time(I so Loved it). One part I thought should not have change was Esther meeting the King before her (one night with the King)the whole point of the movie's name and the scriptures truth (prepuring a year for one night).

I was still blessed, will be showing it at my Youth meeting. It is wonderful tool for sharing God's Love for all man kind.

2674592,3,B000JJSJO6,"While I thought this was an excellent movie, I was very surprised that it so loosely followed the Bible.  I am wondering at this point, if the people who wrote the script own one, or if they even know what one looks like.  The odd thing is that the Bible's version, the true version, is so much more exciting than the one depicted in this film. The sad thing is that many will watch this, thinking that it is from the Bible, but it is not.  This movie would have been better if they had left the Bible totally out of it, or kept to the original script, the one written by God.",1170979200,4,576,4.079646017699115
2674593,5,B000JJSJO6,"Unlike the two leading reviewers, I felt the cinematography was well above the standard in Christian films.  It is beautiful.  I immediately wanted to read the book of Ester ... and I did all in one sitting.  Like most films the book is better than the movie.  I'm not sure why the director/writers decided not to follow the story line in the Bible.  In the Book of Ester the King wasn't harsh with her except in one instance - he gave her an angry look.  His love for her was passsionate.  In the movie he was made to seem to hate her at times, and was lost in confusion over her ... which is not present in the Bible.  Also, in the movie Haman is mockingly begging for his life, but in the Bible Haman is very seriously begging for his life ""for he saw that evil was determined against him by the King.""  Admittedly, I am not a historian and have never studied the book of Ester.

The thing is this.  I watched this movie once. When it ended I wanted to watch it again immediately.  That rarely happens.  The second time I watched it with my daughter, age 17.  When it ended she said, ""I want to watch it again right now ... start it over!""  I told her that was my reaction as well.  She also said, ""I didn't know there were such good stories in the Bible.  I wish they would make them all into movies ... then I could learn about the Bible.""

Most important to note, this movie changed how I talk to the Lord.  The deep faith of Ester portrayed in this movie (excellent job by actress/ director/all envolved) caused me to know that when I pray I AM before God.  Ester's intense humility before her king caused me to feel an intense humility before my King.  Now, when I pray I know I am standing humbly before His throne in His presence.  It's a good feeling to know the King receives your petitions.  This I honestly got from the movie ... not the book.

Ask yourself, If it is possible for this woman to obtain a profound closeness to God in her prayer life, to be moved to read the Bible, and for her 17 year old daughter to now long to hear the beautiful stories of the Bible, what are the possibilities for me? for my family?  Why bother yourself with cinematography, acurate settings, or movie making abilities when you can gain something so much deeper?

2674601,4,B000JJSJO6,"As a HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS and well-read cynic of anything from organized religion, my expectations for this movie were nil.  In fact, I only rented it (having never heard of it before) on the basis of its (perhaps) interesting cinematography, and my interest in period pieces. As a long reader of history and politics, I was frankly impressed that someone, anyone, finally decided to acknowledge that Persia is modern-day Iraq. For all those, I'll just say it, RIGHT WING-NUTS ""praying for our president"", isn't it ironic that many of you also love this movie, the setting for which ""your president"" is ""prayerfully""  destroying?  But off my soapbox, I did find the music and the cinematography beautiful.  The script was OK; it was a vehicle to tell a story.  No movie is going to capture the nuances of any religious text to everyone's satisfaction.  Esther seemed a bit silly to me, although the implication was that her early life and her religion had provided her with the wisdom she would later evince.  Perhaps casting her as young as she was cast was an attempt to imbue her actions with conviction, although, as one reviewer noted, her conviction was internal.  I found Xerxes to be distracting b/c he was so peculiar looking, frankly bordering on Halloweenish.  His acting left me unmoved because I found his behavior at odds with what a Persian man should look like.  I agree with some reviewers that there are too many accents, and I will also add, skin tones, floating through this movie to get a clear picture of where it is.  I know where it is supposed to be, but these minor details would leap out at anyone who can appreciate accuracy.  As to the family friendliness of this, I found it highly sexualized with strange directions.  I would hope that any kid old enough to sit through this, would wonder what a eunuch is, and would appreciate that a ""nation-wide"" meat market is NOT the way a wife should be chosen, story line or not.  Furthermore, I would hope that RESPONSIBLE parents would explain to their children exactly what elements are involved in a healthy marriage, physical and otherwise (the movie hinted at this, but would someone PLEASE just some clothes on Xerxes?)

The music is phenomenal. The costumes amazing, although again, weak on accuracy.  Barring my extreme distaste for agenda driven projects (religion, ideology, etc.), as a cinematic presentation, I found the movie enjoyable.",1170633600,2,2418,4.875305623471883
2674602,4,B000JJSJO6,"Before I saw this movie in theatres I didn't know what to expect.

By the end I was pleasantly surprised by the big effort and obviously big budget devoted to this story. The Bible story of Esther leaves out some small details that, of coarse, when made into a motion picture, must be filled in. But none of the added details can be decidedly unBiblical, since we don't really know about those details in the first place.

It does, however, add some interesting details to the story line that I doubt happened in real life, so it is a somewhat fictional account of the literal story. It's a movie!

The film is cheesy and overdramatic at parts, but those parts are worth overlooking to see the main point of this story play out.

In my opinion, it's totally worth ignoring the menial faults to see God's limitless power and faithfulness (on behalf of those who will trust Him) portrayed!

A fine movie.",1170633600,,902,4.54320987654321

I decided to pre order it only to be quite disheartened by some of the negative reviews.  For anyone who is a little confused by them as much as I was let me set the record straight.  If you are even considering buying the movie... BUY IT!

First of all the costumes are interesting and elegant.  It is beautifully filmed (not low budget as implied by other reviewers)  It is evident that this was a carefully thoughtout project, execellenly executed.  It is so sad to see people tear this movie down.  The very people who should be supporting it.  It is only through our support that wholesome entertainment can thrive.

If you want a biblical account of the story of Esther then read your bible and study it!  It is a movie for goodness sake.  It is for entertainment.  It is not a school of Theology. The story accurately follows the biblical account. Naturally it fills in the blanks where the bible does not go into detail.

These areas needed to be dipicted but do not change the meaning of the story in any way.  Ofcourse the details are based on information of the people and of the time.

In short, it is a great movie!",1170374400,26,1248,4.318965517241379
2674605,4,B000JJSJO6,"So this was One Night With the King. I'd had high hopes for it. The trailer made the film look stunning - which, at some points, it was - but it was certainly not as I'd expected. I'm certainly unable to review this movie based on its biblical accuracy - I'm not educated enough in Jewish history nor do I wish to tackle the movie based on its reported factual errors. The truth is, as flawed as the movie is, by the time it's finished, I must admit, it's enjoyable. Good family fun fare.

Tiffany Dupont, as Hadassah/Esther, is lovely - she looks at once innocent and womanly, and it is believable that a king would choose her over all other ""candidates,"" for all her beauty, wit, and intelligence. And while Dupont has potential, I wonder if the casting agents couldn't have found a better actress for the role? I have a small pet peeve when it comes to period films that contain several actors with several different accents, although they are playing people of the same community; Dupont switches back and forth from elegant tones to that one would hear on the street. It can't all be blamed on her acting alone, however; when the screenwriter goes from lines like, ""... he promptly keeled over and died,"" to ""Believed you I would beg for my life?"" I'm sure it would be confusing for anyone to figure out how they want to speak. As for Luke Goss, as the king, I debate back and forth as to whether he's a man of strength, fit to be ruler of the world, or just your regular joe who was lucky enough to be born with a crown on his head. Well, no matter - he's handsome, and the director certainly took advantage of the fact he has a bod of steel.

Speaking of the director, Michael O. Sajbel - the man definitely tried. This movie, like Dupont, had waves of potential, but teetered back and forth from looking like an epic worthy of the big screen to an underbudget cable movie. *sigh* More money, more time? Perhaps a better movie. Omar Sharif, John Rhys-Davies, and James Callis were probably the only consistent three in the entire feature.

As for the fact that a lot of viewers seem be concerned with this film's incorrectness, I have to say I'm glad I'm not well versed in Esther's true story (yet). I'd probably just find myself more annoyed.

Enough negativity. Why the four stars? What I do find wonderful about this movie is that for all its flaws, it gets the point across. Yes, Hadassah was born to become queen, to save her people. Yes, the king lowered his scepter for her, proving his love. Why it was a magic amulet, and not God, that moved the king to believe her and defend her, is beyond me. Who ""owns"" this story doesn't matter - whether it's Jewish or Christian, it's a story of faith, belief, integrity, and love. The film may not be perfect, no, but it's the idea behind it that's inspirational and moving.",1170115200,4,2831,4.438461538461539
2674606,5,B000JJSJO6,"The movie is not 100% accurate to the letter of the Bible.  Hollywood had to fill in to make it visually connect.  They did a very good job at it.  I believe all sound read the story in the Bible regardless if you see or do not see the movie.  The movie was just good, inspiring, and encouraging.  Some of the scenes make good teaching/discussion tools.  One prime example is the scene where the King sees Esther leaving the garden and he thinks she is having an affair but she is learning of the plot against the Jews from her uncle.  In turn, she goes to explain to the king and hears two people in his chamber and thinks the King has replaced her when it's the servants playing around in the King's chamber.  That's a lesson in all that you hear and see is not what is appears to be.  Another teaching example is the prepartion Esther goes through and the mentoring she receives to be presentable or worthy of being someone's spouse.  Something that we need to think about doing with our not so mature women (independent of age).  Like I said...Good movie. Family movie. Teaching/Discssion Tool.",1170115200,5,1098,4.467336683417085
2674617,4,B000JJSJO6,"As you can see from the comments of my fellow reviewers, the thoughts go from one end of the spectrum to the other.  It's hard to review a movie like this because so many personal feelings and convictions come into play.  Yes, the movie does have a lot of differences from scripture but its a movie.  That's what movies do.  They take artistic license which sometimes is necessary for a film to move at a certain pace or to allow the film to move smoothly from one scene to the next.  Remember the Ten Commandments?  A lot of that movie was not scriptural but it is still considered one of the greatest and most loved films of all time.

I agree with one reviewer who noted that the sound editing was less than perfect.  It should have been better and some of the dialog was lost because of that.  The exterior location shots were beautiful.  Costuming was also excellent even if there was more of an Indian influence rather than a Persian one.

There's one thing that a good film does that's worth all the tea in London. That is to make you curious enough to read the source material.  That's what this film did for me as I haven't read the Book of Esther in quite awhile.  When you return to the source material you can then clear up all of the inconsistencies that you found in the film and then some.

I hope that people will view and buy this film so that Hollywood gets the message that they are some folks who are tired of the naked sex, violent, drug ridden, foul mouthed movies that they constantly churn out from year to year.  Don't let others put you off just because you hear them say it wasn't accurate, or it's a movie just for Jewish folks, etc.  Send Hollywierd the message today.

This movie was made by Christians to show their love for their Jewish brothers and sisters.  Forgive them if they didn't get it quite right.  The fact that it was produced at all is what's really important.",1170115200,9,1905,4.360795454545454

It has allot to do with Esther, who because of her actions saves the Jewish People.  Whether the movie is actuate is besides the point, it tries to do something with a story good and bad.  It was also a story of the treatment that we, Jews, have gotten over the thousands of years that we have been in exile, both by christians, and muslims, etc.

One of the most distressing ones is that the King and Eshter are shown to have a long standing lovers quarrel over the misunderstanding that each of them has been messing around with a member of the other sex that isn't resolved until the day of the banquet.

Dupont's acting was wonderful. She showed the utter joy of being alive and innocence of Hadassah/Esther, which were so refreshing and beautiful to see. For the first time I got it:  the inner struggle of Esther to put her life on the line for her people. At the end of the film a narration ties the biblical history to how Purim started.

When young girls and women are searching to find their happiness, Esther sets out to find out ""what will please the King""? It was all she had on her mind. And this story shows us how no matter what, she never strayed from that course. One Night is a riveting tale of deceit, betrayal, intrigue and better than any romance novel.

We as Christians complain because there are no ""clean"" movies to see, then we complain and find fault when God Almighty moves on someone to produce one.  Bet you don't have a problem watching many ""PG-13"" and ""R"" rated movies with every other word a very crude vulgarity, and violence and nudity abounding just for the sake of it.  I know of many Christians who watch these sinful movies on a regular basis and are not even ashamed of it.  While this movie is not perfect (what movie is?), it was fantastic.  Tiffany Dupont, as Queen Esther, did a superb job in portraying her multi-faceted character.  I loved her child-like playfulness, and was deeply moved during her unsummoned walk through the hall and up to the King's throne.  When she paused at the base of the steps and the music changed and scenes from her happy childhood were shown, it was heartrending.  This young woman was most likely about to have her head chopped off, (after all, King Xerxes had just told her in the library that if she came before him again her fate would be worse than Vashti's), and she acted this part so beautifully.  She truly brought the drama of that incident to life for me.  How would I act if I were facing a likely death?  Luke Goss, as King Xerxes, also had to portray a character of many facets.  I was so moved by the extreme and very believable emotions he displayed in the scene with Esther where she asked him why he had summoned Vashti when he knew she would not come.  Also, I was extremely touched by his deep emotions in the library with Esther later in the movie.  Esther drastically affected his life, as evidenced by the changes in his character at the end.  And who cares if the writers did not exactly follow the Bible narrative.  The changes did not make a difference in the overall story, and the Bible does leave much to the imagination.  I drove over two hours to see ""One Night"" in the theater, I have pre-ordered it, and also watched it all three times it was shown on New Year's Eve, and have watched it every night since then.  Guess you could say I really love it!!!  This movie has been critically compared to ""The Passion of the Christ"", but I did not like ""The Passion"" at all because of the blood and gore and violence.  It was definitely over the top.

It was very unscriptural, with many of the changes damaging to both the characters and the overall story. Both were filled with unpractical holes. Esther in particular was played as a flighty, silly, goofy girl, who somehow still wins the heart of the king. The biblical Esther was not recorded as flighty, silly or goofy. She is portrayed as having a habit of going out alone after dark, something an unmarried girl would not have dared to do.

What is particularly memorable to me was when Mordecai read from Isaiah 40:31 to a Jewish gathering to rally them to plead to God for deliverance from Haman, and of course, Esther's resolution to go to the king Ahasuerus and plead for the cause of her people despite her own life being at stake, ""If I perish, I perish.""

There of course were some Hollywood details that were added, but I do not think that they distracted from the bible story because the bible does not talk about them.

I do have to agree that the filming and lighting could have been much better, but I think that once you get past that aspect, the movie is pretty well made.  There are some pretty moving moments with music, such as when Esther approaches the King.  It would have been nice if the entire movie could have been filled with that passion.

2674639,4,B000JJSJO6,"The first time I went to see this movie, I enjoyed it (despite the obvious production flaws), but I was thoroughly overwhelmed by all the history & all the strange names & all the multiple/twisty-turny plotlines & so I walked out of the theater feeling like I didn't really grasp everything that happened ...

So then I went home & read the entire book of Esther (it doesn't take very long -- it's a small book) & then went BACK to the theater & watched the movie AGAIN ...

BIG DIFFERENCE!

At that point, I was also able to identify all the ""poetic license"" that was taken with the book of Esther, but I do NOT think that it detracted from the overall message & profound truth of the Biblical story -- rather, I think that it ENHANCED it.

And now, after watching ""One Night With The King,"" the book of Esther is very REAL to me -- like it NEVER has been before.

2674640,5,B000JJSJO6,"Gener8xion Entertainment and TBN's (""The Omega Code,"" ""Carman: The Champion,"" ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"") production of the Biblical story of Esther (real name Hadassah) is nothing less than a monumental epic, staying true to the original source while taking some creative liberties where appropriate. The visuals are astounding (get the complete screenplay by Stephen Blinn, co-writer of ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"" with John Fasano, which is an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, combined with the original script; some things in the finished film differ from what was written-I will not launch into details about what was cut and where; a ""Director's Cut"" DVD is definitely in order here) and the acting, led by an all-star cast and newcomer Tiffany Dupont (as Esther) is first-rate. Despite top billing, Peter O'Toole (""Lawrence Of Arabia"") only appears for one minute, in the film's prologue, as the prophet Samuel. Blink and you'll miss him. Luke Goss (the Creature in 2004's Hallmark TV version of ""Frankenstein"") is appropriately wimpy as Xerxes I (brush up on your history if you're confused). John Rhys-Davies (""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade,"" ""The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy"") is excellent as Mordecai ben Jair, Esther's uncle and adoptive father. John Noble (the evil Denethor in ""The Return Of The King"") oozes menace as Admantha, Prince Of The Face. As usual, Omar Sharif (""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" ""Dr. Zhivago"") is perfect as Memucan, Xerxes' general and father figure. And of course, Tiffany Dupont shines in her film debut as the lovely Esther. The film also makes references to the fate of Darius I, (who was killed in battle against the Greeks), Xerxes' father, and the coming war with Greece, which is known as the battle of Salamis (at which Xerxes was defeated and which brought about the downfall of the Persian Empire). This is a movie for girls mostly. They will relate to Esther in more ways than one. Honestly, I loved this film. I nearly cried during a few scenes, I can't wait for the DVD. Rated PG for some thematic elements.",1166227200,13,2110,4.980169971671388
2674641,2,B000JJSJO6,"The most special moments in life are the ones in which everything just falls into place -- they are not the ones that are carefully planned and coordinated. The current movie released this week is about Esther who maneuvered her place in King Xerxes harem. She was a Hebrew girl whose heritage she kept from the King when she spent her one night with the king and as a consequence became Queen Esther. She was devious for her age but her destiny was to infiltrate this king's household and take her vengeance for what the Persians had done to her main ancestor. Five hundred years previous to her campaign to become his Queen, one of her female ancestors had survived her husband's beheading out in the desert; her son begat a new generation of displaced Isralies whose desire was to procreate until there were enough of them to overcome the Persian king and his court.

About all they do in the Old Testament is procreate a lot of prodigy. This movie was in no way a return to the spectaculars of the Fifties of the religious sagas. In fact, it was not religious at all. I was disappointed in this silly attempt to film an Old Testament story out of the Bible. It just can't be done properly in this modern age of atheism.

It depresses me to see the older shell of previously first-rate actors like Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff. It would be much better to use character actors and let us remember the stars as they were when the stars as they were when they were stars. Some (too many these days) don't know when to retire and bask in the gloty of days gone by.

Ruth and Esther were role models for the young women of their time, but that time is long past and will never come again.",1164672000,3,1688,4.386581469648562

The first part of the movie was easy to follow but as it went along it made less sense.  I felt as the movie neared the end; it was like they put things in that came out of nowhere. The scenes between Tiffany and Luke were so plastic; lovers just don't behave that way!  Anyway, as I walked out, I said to myself,""Is that the best you can do?""",1164153600,2,485,4.073684210526316
2674646,4,B000JJSJO6,"Why did this movie with its several imperfections (actors not always clearly audible, directing not as good as it could have been) succeed so well and in so many ways?

Perhaps because it combined some identifiable winning ingredients (attractive actors, stunning visual effects, captivating plot) with others that are currently in very short supply (modesty, faithfulness, integrity, hope and biblical view of God), presented in a genre of history where the good actually won out against all odds. Maybe it was an accident that in its unsophisticated style it had something for every age group, rather than targeting one audience sector. Hhmm.

This is a movie that deserves to be a box office hit even without the professionalism one would have liked to see. Both Esther and the King are strikingly good looking, and yet are refreshingly unspoiled, and they hold our attention almost entirely on personal charisma (which in the case of the king starts rather weak but grows throughout the film).  The computer animations were more than adequate, and even without what could have been done with this amazing piece of biblical history, it succeeded in captivating me. I'd definitely see it again, and I'm planning on buying the DVD for a gift.

I hope other movie makers take note of this one's surprising success and get on with creating other films that promote similar messages. I've  had enough of the valueless variety that depends on sex, shock, and special effects.

Esther, probably only a teenager at the time she was chosen to be the King's second wife, risked her own life to save the lives of her countrymen simply because she believed she should, knew she could, and yet only had hope in her God for the victory that did, indeed, come about. (Pity the movie omitted to mention that she had asked all the Jews to fast with her for 3 days before she approached the King with her request).

Major movie makers should consider all these qualities, and pay attention to the biblical spirituality that permeated this movie. More of this genre could encounter a ready market amongst an audience that seems to be hungry for entertainment that offers real life stories with the same sense of purpose as One Night With The King.",1163808000,12,2231,4.870712401055409
2674657,1,B000JJSJO6,"If ever there was a production that confirms the ego-mania of Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) and its followers, it is this movie. A few weeks before viewing it, I watched its ""opening night"" proceedings on our local TBN channel. For several hours, I watched a parade of gawkish movie ""reviewers"" give lavish praise to its ""stunning five-star"" quality and performances. I said to myself, ""Given this accolade, I'd better go see it."" It finally appeared at our local movie theater. I went, I saw, and I left wondering whether TBN has any idea what constitutes excellent movie making. First, the acting was atrociously forced. Luke Goss, who played the Persian King Xerxes, needs some rudimentary acting lessons. Tiffany Dupont, who plays Esther, has potential, and a quality director could have mined much more from her. Three famous actors were employed in this movie, Peter O'Toole (who only appears for a couple of minutes at the beginning), Omar Sharif, and John Rhys-Davies. But, employing famous actors does not guarantee a good movie. What this movie lacks is CHEMISTRY. Great-acting generates top quality performances and top quality performances do not exist in this movie. Second, in addition to poor acting, the sets (including rather crude CGI) do not reflect reality. Third, the music ... my God ... there was too much overkill in it. Music and story must blend ... to put it gracefully, the music was mawkishly trite. TBN is promoting this movie as quality Christian movie making, the kind that will make Hollywood ""stand up and notice."" My advice to TBN, ""Admit that you are still in the kindergarten stage, stop being ego-maniacs, learn from the Hollywood masters, and face the facts - you do not know how to make a movie."" The worst aspect of this movie is that it butchered a powerful Biblical story. As my daughter told me after we left the movie theater, ""I prefer the original; it is much better."" Read the original; don't bother with this poor imitation.",1163721600,24,1978,4.925149700598802

2674659,3,B000JJSJO6,"This will not be an in-depth review. There are plenty of those already. Let me just offer a brief opinion from the perspective of a bible teacher and secular historian.

First of all, this film is a cut above the typical 'Christian' attempt at Hollywood quality. The scenery of ancient Persia looks more Indian than Persian, but the computer effects are quite acceptable and remind one (remotely) of the Lord of the Rings genre. (Made no less obvious by the casting of two of the stars from those films.)

Having said that, the film is not up to the quality of 'Joseph', Moses', or other such movies done on a Hollywood budget. The sound quality is not top-notch, and many lines are inaudible. The acting is better than expected, including a worthy effort by Tiffany Dupont as Esther. The King Xerxes character seemed somewhat strained and lacking at times, and Peter O'Toole makes only a brief cameo.

The weakest aspect of the film is the anachronistic and too often silly reliance on the star of David theme which reduced the historical accuracy (and believability) of the movie. Also disappointing was the deflating conclusion of a story which gleans much of its suspense from the hanging of Haman. This movie deserved a much better ending.

As a historian, I enjoyed the references to Greek democracy, Gilgamesh of Sumer, and the imminent downfall of King Xerxes at the hands of the Greeks. As a Christian, I appreciated what the directors attempted to do--make a modern, interesting retelling of the Esther story. Understanding the limitations mentioned, and accepting the liberties taken with adding 'flesh' to the bones of the story, most Christians will be at least mildly pleased with this effort.",1163289600,163,1707,4.916666666666667
2674660,5,B000JJSJO6,"When I first went to see this movie I was only going to support the Christian movie business. But when I stepped out of that theatre my perspective was completely altered. The movie's main details were quite accurate to the Bible's book of Esther. As well, the characters were very well cast, and the movie flowed in a perfect sense. My seven dollars was well worth it, and I would love to see it again, as well as purchase the DVD!

By far, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I'm sure will be for a long time.",1162857600,9,528,4.12621359223301
2674661,1,B000JJSJO6,"If you are a devout Christian you're likely, for some reason, to rank this film highly.  My guess is because it's sort of a sappy tale made for an elementary Sunday School class.  It's a feel good story with a Biblical foundation.

You might enjoy this movie, too, if you like fantasy flicks, with overdone computer generated sets of fantastic, otherworldly palaces and fairy tale kingdoms.  If, however, you don't fall into one of those two categories, you probably won't think much of the ""film.""

The general tone of the movie, including the syrupy sweet sound track, is better suited for an animated cartoon, than the serious Biblical epic it tries to imitate.  How the producers convinced Omar Shariff, John Rhyss-Jones... even Peter O'Toole to lend their names to such a pathetic work is beyond me... What were they thinking?

I went to see the film because there aren't many modern movies about Jewish stories.  I figured if Shariff, O'Toole and Rhyss-Jones were in it, it might be good.  I was thinking something like ""The Ten Commandments,"" only for the Purim story.  I had not heard any reviews and  didn't know anything about this film other than it was about Esther.  Boy, was I disappointed.

As a Jew I could not have been more embarrassed at the cartoonish way that Esther's Megilla translated for the screenwriter.  The use of the Greek name, Xerces, instead of King Achashverosh, and the references to Haman as an ""Agagite,"" may have been minor irritants, but the many, many other ""artistic"" variances from the original text were downright grating, if not offensive.  As I said, it was a screenplay more fit for a Disney animation studio than for a serious film.  If you imagine Esther as a strong, smart and courageous, woman then you'll likely be offended... think more  ""The Little Mermaid"" than Scarlet O'Hara.

The bottom line, if you're in the Church Choir, this movie likely sings to you.  You'll enjoy your school children seeing it, and it may even make you feel like you are witnessing the good word.  If, however, you are looking for a serious, even critical, treatment of the Megilla and the Purim story, you will be tremendously disappointed.  As a feel good Sunday school lesson it's probably right on... but as a cinematic work of art ""One Night With the King"" is absolutely terrible.",1162771200,10,2316,4.812658227848101
2674662,5,B000JJSJO6,"Let me say that I am a very stern critic of films.  Though I love plays and films -and I have written a few plays myself- most modern-day films to me are shallow, trivial and boring because for the most part, they rely on violence, sex and special effects and neglect dialogue and the development of character.  Flags of Our Fathers is a good example of a well-mounted, expensive mediocre film with vapid characters and a script that could have been slapped together at the last minute for a made-for-TV production.  There was not a single memorable line or performance. The music was insipid and dull. I said of FOOF ""when the last Japanese soldier died it died.""  I also said I would have no interest ever in seeing even five minutes of FOOF again.

Now let me talk about ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING.  It was everything that FOOF was not.  It is a splendid retelling of one of the masterpieces of world literature from that greatest of all classics, the Bible.  For those of you who don't know, Esther is the heroine of the biblical book bearing her name and was the Jewish wife of the King Xerxes of Persia (485- 464 BC or BCE).

Though I knew the story of Esther and Xerxes as least as well as the story of Iwo Jima, ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING, kept me interested and presented the material in a fresh and compelling way. Some nitpickers complain about problems with continuity but this errors (if they are errors) did not distract from the drama in the least, in my opinion.

I didn't know what to expect with this film as the reviews were very mixed.

But I was intrigued but the fact that the WORD OF MOUTH was phenomenal. But people often exaggerate.

But I trust the taste of people I know and who know what I like.

My teenage daughter thought it was the best picture she had seen the entire year.  She was entranced by it and said I was sure to like it.  I did like it.  Very much.  So did my wife and the audience who applauded at the end and who watched the film in silence though occasionally, wiping away  the tears (as I did myself).  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING was visually beautiful.  It had a great story and held my interest every minute and was fast moving (just over two hours).

I thought  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING was very respectful to the original story and there was nothing hokey about it at all.  It was very clear that the story was based very closely on the plot of the Biblical story.  All the elements are there; Queen Vashti disgracing Xerxes at a royal banquet, Moredacai telling Esther to keep her Jewish identity a secret, Mordecai overhearing guards discussing a plot to murder King Xerxes, Mordcai refusing to bow to the evil prince Haman the Agagite.  Peter O' Toole had a nice cameo role as Samuel, the Prophet,and Omar Sharif a good supporting role as Prince Memucan, one of the generals who opposed Xerxes invasion of Greece.

The individuals performances in ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING could not have been better  and there was a lot of chemistry between the players.  Mordecai played by  veteran British character actor John Rhys-Davies was really a tour de force.  Rhys-Davies, who also narrated with his rich Welsh voices,  created an interesting, dynamic, well-rounded figure who begins as a partially assimilated Jew passing himself off as a scribe in the court of Xerxes and who ends up as a prince of the realm who along with Queen Esther saves the Jews from massacre.  His relationship with Hadassah/(Esther) was very warm and believable. Hadassah-Esther was charming played by a very pretty exotic beauty: young Tiffany Dupont.  At first I though she was rather plain but later she became -Eliza Doolittle like- a real lady of elegance and intelligence.  Part of her charm is her unusual ability to read and interpret the classics of Persia and Babylonia as well as the Bible in several languages.  This Cleopatra like class and learned dignity makes her attractive, unique character entirely believable.

Miss Dupont's beauty would not be out of place in Jerusalem today and was entirely believable as the one King Xerxes (Ahasuerus in the Bible) "" loved...more than all the women, and she {Esther) found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins (Est. 2:17).  I could not help but compare her to Haya Harareet the ""Esther"" of Charlton Heston's Ben Hur  Haya, who really outside of Ben Hur was principally known from a few Italian sword and sandal epics,  was attractive, comely and competent but too old and somewhat matronly -she was pushing  30 in 1959- for the part of the young girl Esther in the Lew Wallace story.  By contrast the girlish Miss Dupont is totally believable as a young woman in her late teens or early twenties.  Of course, Ben Hur was a big budget epic but besides that it was satisfying as a historical and religious drama in the way most Biblical epics of that era were not. ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING recaptures the same respect for religious heritage as BEN HUR and succeeds as a human drama as well though not on the same large scale as BEN HUR.  That alone is a considerable achievement in my book.
I enjoyed Miss Dupont's performance and her relationship with the Hegal the black Royal Eunuch  played movingly with Tommy 'Tiny' Lister.  Ester had beauty but also charm and brains and with her slim resources built up a network of loyal friends and informants who helped her, in the end, triumph over the ruthless Persian princes.  Xerxes played Luke Goss was made to seem a tragic, doomed figure and actually quite sympathetic, hardly at all like the debauched Xerxes of so many re-telling of Herodotus, the Persian Wars or the 300 Sparatans. Haman, the Amelekite played by James Callis was a deliciously sinister anti-Semite who got his comeuppance (off-screen) just before his planned pogrom on the 13th day of the the 12th month (Adar).

Prince Admatha  was played by John Noble of Lord of the Rings fame, and was deliciously vile as a plotting, corrupt Persian vizier.

The exotic Indian setting worked and this movie had everything, lovely gardens, exotic monkeys -who playfully ate the pork Esther cut for herself but did not eat-, human characters, intrigue, suspense, betrayal, sudden reversals, delicious reverseals and as in the Bible a happy ending (for the Jews at least).

I am aware that there is some question, historically, whether or not Mordecai and Ester or the antagonist Haman were authentic persons.  Historians have debated whether or not the Jewish tale was pure fiction and derived from Persian legends of Marduka and Ishtar.

But the film was very faithful to the Bible tale of Esther as we know it without being stagy and flat like THE GREATEST STORY EVERY TOLD, for example, George Steven's noble failure to tell the story of Jesus.  The Greatest Story Ever Told was cinematically lush and had strong individual performances but it just could not succeed as a GREAT movie because it lacked vigor and humanity.  But ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING did succeed mightily.  I know of no other Biblical film with such an interesting and heroic female lead.  The portrayal of Xerxes was totally unexpected and humanly played.

We know the background of Xerxes of Thermopylae fame and his father Darius of Marathon fame to be authentic. We know from Greek sources that some of his advisors opposed the invasion of Greece as beyond the resources of the Persian Empire. We also know that historically there seems to be no independent corroborating evidence that Queen Vashti or Esther existed (outside of the Bible).  This does not mean that there is not a solid historical basis to the story.  Whoever wrote the original story had first hand knowledge of Persian customs and practices.

ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is no dud.  It really turned out to be one of the most interesting studies of anti-Semitism and quasi-fascist fanaticism made recently.  There is no question the film makers were sympathetic to the Jews defending themselves from anti-Semitic pogroms past and present.  There is no question the filmmakers were making a direct connection between the evil and murderous hatred of Haman with the Nazis and present day Islamic radicals who repeat over and over calumnies about the Jews and America while urging death and annihilation to America and all the Jews.

I recommend ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING highly to anyone who is interested in the heritage of the Bible,  history and splendid free heritage of the Israel and the Western world.  As I viewed the film I could not help think that Islamofascists of modern day Persia and Arabia would deeply hate and resent this film and would like to destroy the negative.  Then I came to realize that many appeasing secular progressive critics -who cringe before the threat of Islamo-facsict radicals - would not like the message of this film which is that love and truth will triumph over evil , lies and deception.

At the same time I thought that Jews -particularly the heroes of the IDF- and Christians all over the world would gain a new appreciation for the story of Esther and Purim.

Don't be deceived.  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING  is entertaining, wholesome, literate and, inspiring.

Filmgoers  of taste and discrimination will enjoy this solid film adaptation of the Biblical story of Esther ""beautiful and lovely"" in which beauty, brains and GOOD triumph over EVIL.  Brava, Esther.

This is a film I will watch again with great enjoyment.

2674666,5,B000JJSJO6,"I don't go to the movies to critique the production; figure out how much money did or did not get invested; analyze the lighting, language, use of reasearch or technology.  I want to see something NOT based on sex, foul language, grotesque or unnecesary violence and depravity or anything like it.  I DO want something based on truth; heartwarming; that makes me laugh or basically anything that I can walk away from not feeling dirty, depressed, angry or robbed.  ENTERTAINMENT is not entertaining like that.

This movie may not have the most perfect biblical dialogue or delve the depths of historical truth (Like Passion of the Christ) but it was not presented as that type of work.  It is based on a book, ""Hadassah"" by Tommy Tenney, that was based on the Book of Esther in the Bible. The language is more contemporary, but that allows any viewer to be able to follow and potentially become absorbed with the story.  Good and Truth triumph over evil, which is the ""End of the story"" in the Bible and it is what everyone truly hopes for - perhaps at the movies and always in life.
