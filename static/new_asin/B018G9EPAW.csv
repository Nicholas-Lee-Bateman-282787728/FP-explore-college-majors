7548332,5,B018G9EPAW,"Finally found this. I did have to get a multi-region DVD player to play it, which was fine. A great collection of Hitchcock's stories. Couldn't find this produced in the U.S. so that's why I bought the player that plays all regions.",1484179200,5,232,4.5476190476190474

7548334,1,B018G9EPAW,I give the seller 1star because you cant give 0 stars.  I purchased the alfred Hitchcock hour complete collection seasons1-3. But the dvds would not play at all. Kept getting err message. Little did I know it was non usa. Which i might add is Not listed on the dvd. Seller refused to work with me. I'm out of a few pennies shy of  $150.00. Item is brand new! Still would sell for less than what I paid.  What an expensive lesson. Didn't break me but will know better in the future!  Let the buyer beware!,1479945600,7,504,4.21875
7548335,5,B018G9EPAW,Loved the show..but why can't we get a Region 1 release????,1475884800,7,59,4.454545454545454
7548336,5,B018G9EPAW,"This set now completes my set of Hitchcock TV episodes and movies.  I've been wanting this set for a long time, and this is the first time I've seen all 3 seasons in one set.  However, be sure you have an all-region DVD player, however, as these are Region 2 DVDs. Thanks for a flawless transaction.",1469232000,8,299,4.321428571428571

I absolutely LOVE Alfred Hitchcock Hour... the dvd set is hard to come by glad I was able to get my hands on the full set.  I have so many favorites that I can watch over and over again.",1532390400,,377,3.896103896103896

8742296,5,B018G9EPAW,Worth every penny spent. I had to purchase a region free player to play this dvd collection but it is well worth it. Until Universal finally releases Hitchcock Hour on blu-ray this will have to do.,1493510400,4,197,4.5
