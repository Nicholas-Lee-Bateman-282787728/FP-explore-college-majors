8227043,3,B000X73NEA,"Without a doubt,worth more than the $0.69 I paid for it, but less than the cost including shipping.  Just OK, I sent it to a friend who is now stuck with it.",1439769600,,157,3.90625

thank you. Good ofers",1418428800,,56,4.7
8227045,3,B000X73NEA,Pretty general. Not exciting. Don't think I would watch it more than once. Most of the TV series focused more on particular types of aircraft or a particular theater.,1359763200,,166,4.758620689655173
8227046,3,B000X73NEA,"I think they could have spent more time talking about how these weapon systems were deployed during war time but, they did not.",1353888000,,127,4.565217391304348
8227047,4,B000X73NEA,"I would have given it five stars, but the special ""Wings Over Afghanistan"" did not feature the aircraft, but merely mentioned jets in the context of Afghanistan missions.  I would have liked to hear more about all of the various aircraft used in Afghanistan as well as see them in flight.

The special on the Thunderbirds was spot-on, delivering an in-depth look at maneuvers and training of the Air Force Thunderbirds.  I'm not sure what I expected the third special to be, but it would be an excellent introduction to someone not familiar with powered flight and ""heavier-than-air"" flying machines.

For a short time I worked on F-15 Avionics and was afforded much exposure to various flightcraft.  My brother just recently finished 6 years of being a crew chief for C-5s, the largest transport plane currently in use, and my grandfather was a mechanic on P-38 Lightnings during WW2.

I would recommend this set for the look at the Thunderbirds, and the mild education on flight physics, but I would suggest you keep looking if attack aircraft interest you.",1214524800,,1059,4.888268156424581
