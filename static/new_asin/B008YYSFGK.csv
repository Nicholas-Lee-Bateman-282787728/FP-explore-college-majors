5195354,5,B008YYSFGK,"While I am not a Barney-fan, he is a great role model for kids and this DVD is perfect to show kids that doctors are not someone to be afraid of, what they do and how there are different ones.  The DVD covers so much that is perfect for any preschooler such as washing their hands, eating fruits and vegetables, getting out and playing, and more.  This is a great way to show kids all these great lessons in one DVD.",1359331200,,416,4.1234567901234565

8532887,4,B008YYSFGK,"Our son happens to really like Barney, so we bought this one a while back to help start a dialogue with him about his medical visits.  Since he is a child with pretty specialized needs, he has a great many of those that have happened, and will continue to happen.

He likes this video, especially the songs.  He would rate this a 5.  I would rate this a 3, because I think it, like many such products on the market, definitely has a target audience that is a normal functioning and developing child.  This movie does a great job of highlighting the positives about these situations, which of course, you want a child to know, but it is the negatives that a special needs child is going to react strongest to, and will need by far the most preparation for.

In general, I would have to say that writers for movies and children's books don't exactly understand the special circle in hell that is reserved for a parent of a child with special needs trying to prepare them for doctor's offices, dentists, or surgical procedures.  First, you often get to wait months longer then a normal developing child for things like dental procedures because they need to be done in the hospital.  Then you have things like blood pressure cuffs, pulse ox monitors, IVs, good golly it's a never ending list of things you have to try and prepare and desensitize them for.  And then you have a joyful moment where your procedure gets moved up, which is great because you don't have to watch your kiddo suffer with mouth pain for an extra 3 months, only to have to then prepare him/her for what it will be like with much less time.

 And try explaining why you can't eat or drink for half a day to a child with the nature of challenges my child has.  He's going to be hysterical to the point I may end up holding him for a few hours to keep him from harming himself.  Because if restraint is required, I do it myself so he never doubts that love is involved in protecting him from harm.  My son's last ER visit, it took 5 people to hold him down to get done what was needed.  And that was without skipping food for half the day.  So all of those sensory things and people anxieties are going to be amplified like most people can't even imagine.

I could go on.  So for us and our family, this is a starting place to talk, and he loves Barney, but it doesn't address or help him understand the things that are going to be freaking him out the most.  And because he prefers to look at something visually interesting rather then listen to mama talk on and on about what's going to be happening, it would definitely be an advantage to have a product that addresses the things that are going to matter to him most.",1485216000,2,2688,4.34

8532890,5,B008YYSFGK,Loved it,1480723200,,8,3.5
8532891,4,B008YYSFGK,"Our daughter loves Barney! Shes 18 months old and she loves to play doctor with her baby dolls and pretend doctors kit. When we play this Barney episode for her she immediately runs to get her doctors kit and baby dolls (including her Barney stuffed toy). This is a great episode,  but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because my daughter gets bored with the scenes of just Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, and Rif, singing and dancing. There are plenty of scenes with the children, but wish there was more singing and dancing with the kids, rather than the dinosaurs breaking out into song and dance. Over all our little aspiring to be doctor loves this episode.",1480118400,,665,4.450819672131147
