2519615,5,B000EHQU1W,"I have to admit, I am the type of homeschool mother who reads reviews before purchasing what I use in training my children. Most of the reviews I read on the Leap Frog Learning DVD'S were positive and BOY were they ever right!! I have a 5 year old (almost 6) daughter who STRUGGLED learning alpha letters and sounds. She had her favorite letters, but I had to sit with her and go over and over and over the others....this was completely frustrating to her and I. That is until we received Leap Frog Learning DVD's 5 pack. These dvd's are educationally and musically stimulating. My daughter learned all of the alphabet sounds in less than a week, FOR REAL! She has taken to singing the songs and sounding out the letters so much that she is driving her brother crazy. She sounds her letters to sleep. She writes the alphabet on everything, upper and lower case. She tells us what a period, exclamation point and a comma is. And of course sings like mad! She has starting reading and LOVES it. This is by far the best money ever spent on teaching materials ~",1157500800,64,1057,4.425641025641026
2519646,5,B000EHQU1W,"Both my kids have enjoyed and learned lots from these DVDs. I found the music fun - not annoying like so many - and they really seem to help the kids with learning concepts. Definitely a must have if you feel guilty putting your kids in front of the TV, but need to have time to make dinner etc without going crazy!",1419552000,,315,4.096774193548387

2519648,5,B000EHQU1W,"My kids have actually learned to read at the age of 2-to-3 simply by watching the LeapFrog videos. That is, repeatedly over the course of just a few weeks. The videos are not only educational, but fun to watch; they had always *begged* us to turn on the ""ABC video"" (meaning the Leapfrog Learning DVDs) and would start singing along the catchy tunes of alphabet & word songs.",1389830400,2,375,4.529411764705882

2519650,5,B000EHQU1W,"Great characters, catchy tunes, easy to watch.  These are by far the best quality of the Tad dvd's.  I have been disappointed in subsequent productions.  Outstanding for teaching the alphabet, first blended sounds, and early stages reading.  both daughters have enjoyed these and still watch after 3 years.  A family favourite!",1358121600,,327,5.333333333333333
2519651,5,B000EHQU1W,"We showed these to our kids starting 2 years old.  Now on road trips while home schooling a 2nd grader and pre-k, we show them all the time.  The kids think they are fun, funny, and sing along.  They have also called upon the vowel rules for pronunciation while reading aloud to me.  Thankfully I found no goofy bizarre inappropriate content and usually do not with Leapfrog.  I do not recall price or shipping, but I highly recommend!",1356480000,,435,4.5256410256410255

2519654,5,B000EHQU1W,"I bought these for my son when he was 6 months old. He knew how all his letters and sounds by 18 months and could read and write simple words by 3. LOVE these videos. I also teach ESL and have found the sound associations helpful to use with my students.

My daughter came along when the new leapfrog dvds were released. They teach letter names, not sounds and are not half as good educationally as this set. They are more entertaining.

Stick with this set and don't waste time or money on the newer ones.",1315612800,,506,4.260416666666667
2519655,5,B000EHQU1W,"I ordered the DVDs from ZoomCD through Amazon. It arrived three days later, which was reasonable. However, we found one DVD defective. I complained about the defective DVD. ZoomCD has immediately sent me a replacement and an apology. My five year old is watching the DVDs happily and learning the spelling of new words. ZoomCD is also a customer service oriented seller and I am very satisfied with their response and how they addressed my complaint. Result: Both the product and the seller deserve five stars.",1307145600,,510,4.941860465116279
2519676,5,B000EHQU1W,"My son was having problems with sounding out letters and vowels. I went to my local library and picked up a Leapfrog DVD. He loved it. Went back to get more, they were all signed out. So I purchased the set. It was well worth it, the games at the end helped and he went from reading below level to reading on level. I'm a happy mother.",1282867200,,335,4.014925373134329
2519677,5,B000EHQU1W,My daughter started watching this set when she was 4. She'll be 6 next month and this series has help with phonics a lot. Also she really likes them and asks to watch them over other movies.,1281225600,,190,4.162162162162162
2519678,2,B000EHQU1W,"We LOVE the letter factory  and the second word factory movie.  The letter factory does a GREAT job teaching the sounds, and Capital letter recognition.  They don't focus much on the lowercase letters and now I am trying to teach my daughter lowercase letters on my own with flash cards.  But I'm okay with that, I think the most important thing is that she can recognize the letter in some form and say it's sound.  I was amazed at how quickly she started to pick up on them.

The second talking words factory teaches some of the rule to reading like silent E, When 2 vowels go walking the first one does the talking, and blends like Sh.  Each rule has a song that I think is helpful for remembering the rule.  It also has a short song about the vowels.
  but the other 3 movies I didn't like.  I think they focused too much on the plot and trying to be exciting, resulting in missing the mark on actually teaching children the content of the movie.  I especially did not like the number movie and the first talking words movie.  I found the storybook factory a bit anoying, but I could see it being usefull when my daughter is ready to do more advanced reading.

My advice would be to buy the letter factory and the talking words factory II, then forget the other movies.  There has got to be some better options on the market for those ones.",1267660800,10,1344,4.32
2519679,1,B000EHQU1W,I ordered this in 2007 for about $41.00.  I thought these prises are high.  I just ordered them seperately for $56.00.  Just copy each title and paste it in a seperate window.  Add 1 at a time to your cart.  I got all mine through the same seller.  DVD's $39.00 + shipping $17.00.  I might expect to pay more 3 years later but this is ridiculous.,1264896000,5,346,4.151515151515151
2519680,5,B000EHQU1W,"This product is fantastic!!  It took about two times through for my son to learn the alphabet and short/soft letter sounds.  No, it does not teach the long or hard letter sounds, but they teach that secondary anyhow.  The other videos are very good, but not as catchy as the first.  We still watch this occasionally, just for reinforcement.",1261526400,,340,4.711864406779661
2519681,5,B000EHQU1W,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter to help in teaching her how to recognize letters, as well as know the sounds of them.  Well..  before watching any of this, she knew nothing.  In less than 2 weeks, she almost has the entire alphabet down. This is very educational, and will keep their attention.  I highly recommend this set.",1243641600,,333,4.409836065573771
2519682,5,B000EHQU1W,"I keep these videos in the car and my daughter, age 5, loves to sing along with the characters. The Letter Factory actually taught her to say her name for the first time correctly ""J""! She's gaining confidence every day. Thanks Leapfrog!",1243555200,,237,4.666666666666667
2519683,4,B000EHQU1W,"I bought this after reading several positive reviews here, and off of the recommendation of a friend.  My kids are enjoying them, and are really grasping the information quickly.  They especially like the Math Circus, Letter Factory, and Storybook Factory(no longer available?); though they watch all 5.  The tunes are pretty catchy, and the information is clear.  I only gave it 4 stars because I do not subscribe to the ""rules"" taught for reading the ""harder"" words. These are such as: the first vowel says it's name, silent E, consonant blends.  The English language has very few words that actually follow those ""rules""; so I am countering the Leap Frog information with the knowlege that those vowel combinations can stand for many sounds in different words, that the E works together with the middle vowel to stand for a sound, and that the majority of words should not be memorized, but sounded out.  It's working okay.  If you DO subscribe to the ""rules"" they present, you will LOVE this series.  Overall it is another good quality Leap Frog production, well thought out and attractively done to keep the attention of children.  I would buy it again even though not agreeing with them 100%.",1243468800,,1198,4.862068965517241
2519684,5,B000EHQU1W,"I bought this series as well as the Preschool Prep series.  This is SO much more entertaining than the other--it has an actual story line that suits the purpose of teaching the letter names/sounds.

The downside is that it only uses one type of letter font, and the lower-case letters are only shown briefly, whereas the Preschool Prep series uses SEVERAL different font types to show each letter and it uses both upper and lower-cases.",1241481600,,436,4.8

My older daughter (2 1/2) learned all her letters and their sounds after watching it only a few times. Even my younger daughter is starting to learn them as well and she's only 17 months.  My older daughter will sing the song to her and she will insert the letter sound.  I had a hard time believing what I was hearing at first!  I turn these on when I'm trying to get something done around the house and they actually sit through the WHOLE thing!  And I don't feel at all guilty because they are both REALLY learning..and having fun at the same time.  As a teacher and a mom, I recommend these to everyone!",1240444800,,717,4.2592592592592595

She phoned me the other day to relate her experiences.  Her son is does not enjoy movies or tv but the leapfrog dvd set grabbed his attention so much that he does not go out to play wth his friends anymore. We cant find these product anywhere is South Africa. Our only hope is the internet.

By sheer osmosis (if nothing else), the kids will learn the letters and their sounds.  I think the words and math videos are a little advanced for her, but she likes to watch the frogs in them anyway.  It makes education fun for kids whereas my flashcard idea was only partially successful.",1239926400,,393,4.2

2519712,3,B000EHQU1W,"If anyone can recommend a better quality series on the same subject, I'd love to know of it.

I think if I had shown these to my son (recently turned 4) when he was 3 or so, it would have been better.  Now, he's a movie critic and the shortcomings of the animation quality and script mean it does not hold his attention as well as say Backyardigans or Wonder Pets.

However, he did watch the Letter Factory about 4 times over about a month (I'd put it in the DVD player to watch during breakfast) and he's got the idea of the letter sounds.  But he never ""chooses"" the LeapFrog dvds to watch.

He likes The Story dvd better than the Make a Word or Code Word Caper... the Math Factory is dismal.",1239580800,,694,4.149253731343284

- Learn to Read - Storybook Factory: advanced reading (punctuation, story/character/plot understanding, written vs spoken words etc)
- Math Circus: learn numbers and basic math

After watching the Letter Factory, he not only has greatly improved on letter recognition but he has almost mastered all the phonetics of the alphabet.  His favorite DVD is Word Factory.  He is now (after a month) asking me how to spell words and writing smaller three letter words.  Before watching this DVD he was not really interested in learning the alphabet and it was a struggle to work with him.

2519731,5,B000EHQU1W,"I am always looking for something educational for my son that can be fun and interesting too.  The Leapfrog DVDs incorporate a small story and plot line into it's education of the alphabet from phonetics to putting letters together to make words, reading, counting and math.

My son has been watching these since he was much younger than the ""recommended age"" on the discs because they are entertaining.  He surprised me when he started saying and identifying his alphabet since before he turned two.  If you are going to have to be stuck watching the same dvd a million times with your kids at least these one's aren't so painful!

I do wish there was an alphabet one that includes lower case letters more since the letter factory only focuses on capital letters which may make things a bit harder in the long run.",1237507200,,815,4.631944444444445

I think it is a wonderful set for helping your child learn to read. In just a couple of weeks of watching these videos off and on, our four year old is sounding out words, and our seven year old is reading much better than before. Even our two year old walks around the house saying the little rhymes that help the children learn. I highly recommend this set for those who wish to help their children along with their reading.

I was amazed at how quickly he learned ALL of his letter sounds after watching the letter factory only 3 times. We have the fridge magnet that does the same thing, but he would lose interest after we had reviewed half of the alphabet. The letter factory is the only video we have watched at this point...but I can't wait to see how he will learn from the other 4 videos in this 5 box set!! I highly recommend it. If you are a mom who doesen't like your kids to watch T.V., don't worry I am the same way too. I feel very comfortable letting him have this learning tool to watch.

My son received a magnetic letter learner made by LeapFrog that he just LOVES and is truly enabling him to learn all of his letters and sounds. I especially liked the fact that all of the vowels had both the short and long vowel sounds. When a friend told me about these videos, I did not hesitate to order them.

I was quite disappointed when the only vowel sounds given on the Talking Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory DVDs were the short vowels. LeapFrog loses one star from me for that.

I still give this DVD set 4 stars for its high ability to keep a 27 month old's attention while helping him to learn at the same time. It even teaches children about capital letters versus lower case letters. Way to go Leapfrog!

Some have said they wished they did lower case letters so if that's a concern, know that it is all upper case letters. The songs are very cute without being too annoying, though they do get stuck in your head! The DVDs are the only ones that keep my active toddler sitting still for most of the video. They build on one another from Letter Factory to Storybook Factory. The move from letters, to simple words, to more complex words in the second part of Word Factory. We haven't watched the Math Circus and Storybook Factory too much so I can't add too much. I highly recommend this set. They also go well with many of the Leap Frog toys.

He asks for ""letters"" to be played about once a day and we've also tried out the words and storybook dvd and all of them are engaging and have fun songs and pictures that seem to work for him.  He's able to more easily pronounce different letters and I've complemented the video set with a place mat with the alphabet and doodlepro type writing toy to help him further work on identifying letters and he ""sings"" the sounds like the video which is cute.

I've heard great things about the other two videos that we haven't started yet as they are for older age group such as the math circus -- but who knows maybe he'll learn to do math at age 3 with this set at this rate.  Seriously though, we've looked at and tried the other ones like elmo and seasame street and brands like baby einstein and this series is the one that really has helped with language and pronounciation in a way that the others have not.

I wasn't sure that he would even like them because he is a little particular.  But after only watching the Letter Factory about 4 times, he knows the majority of his letter sounds and walks around the house singing the songs.  These videos are very effective.  I do agree with another mother in that the letter ""L"" is not enunciated correctly on this video.  It is taught as ""Uhl"" instead of ""Luh"".  It is a little bit of a problem because at the end of the video, the letter ""L"" says his name, my son thinks he is saying ""Oh, Oh"", and he has begun repeating that the letter ""L"" says ""Oh, Oh"".  In addition, the first video, Letter Factory, teaches only short vowels.  But, for the most part, these videos are great.  I would highly recommend the LeapFrog LeapPad Easy Reader Phonics Kits 1-3 to complement these videos.

The Letter Factory and Math Circus are the ones that are at her level or a little above her level. The other DVDs will be more appropriate in time. One thing I do not appreciate about the DVDs is how they tend to emphasize pronouncing letters ""perfectly"" and there's a push to being ""the best."" I don't value that kind of competitiveness especially in young children. Cognitively, it's a great set; socio-emotionally, it's not ""perfect.""",1202601600,,602,4.854368932038835

She has learned all her beginning phonics and she sings the ""sounds"" song from ""The Letter Factory"" DVD everywhere.  We even sing it in the grocery store to keep her ""engaged"" in something constructive.  She also has learned how to read simple words (""The Talking Words Factor"" and ""Code Word Caper"") and now she is very interested in learning to read.  She asks me to spell different words all the time.  She even knows how to spell her first name ""Melody"" and even her last name.  The ""Math Circus"" DVD is fabulous too.  I only wish that it focused on counting past ten, too.  Now we count as we do errands in the car and we sing ""The Numbers Song"".  These DVDs really have jump-started her interest in learning to read and to count.

I recommended these DVDs to my nephew who did not have as much interest in learning his numbers or letters and now he is on his way to reading, too.

These are fabulous.
Update:  January 2008.  My daughter is now three.  She just had her third birthday and she requested a ""green frog"" birthday.  She enjoys watching the Leapfrog DVDs so much.  She is continuing to learn both math and reading.  She now sounds out almost every word she sees, including words on cereal boxes and road signs, not to mention words in her books.  She tells her 16 month old brother to ""sound it out"" when they are playing and they are looking at books or anything with words.  Amazingly, my son only knows how to speak a little over a handful of words, but at 16 months, he knows over 50% of his phonics as I quiz him on the alphabet.

I am not usually a LeapFrog fan, but they did a very nice job with this.  I have a background in education and it is very clear they used proven methods for teaching the subject matter.  And, the story is fun too.  My son already knew his ABCs and after watching this video about 4 times, he learned the sounds of all the letters.

After a couple viewings, he began using the magnetic letters on Grandma's refrigerator; saying the letter, making the sound, and saying the word for the letter.  While my son was playing with his plastic farm animals, I observed him panting like the ""H"" (for hot) and saying, ""Horse is hot and tired.  He needs a drink,"" then gave the horse some water.  He progressed thru each animal using the appropriate animal name and declaring each one hot and tired, giving them water.

After watching the cartoons, she was more interested in learning words and applying her phonics during reading.  She was soooo happy and always remembered how the letters made the sound and the funny storyline that came with it... I really think this is the best phonics DVD that we had ever bought as the tonation and sounds come out very real even though the whole concept was pure cartoon.

Every letter makes a sound, the 'A' says ""ah"".""",1174176000,,480,4.494252873563219

2519938,5,B000EHQU1W,"A great asset to any child's DVD collection.  No matter how much I try I could never make learning letter sounds and how to build words as much fun as Professor Quigley.  My daughters love the songs and inventive tools used to teach in these videos.  A little bit of reinforcement by her Dad and I and my three year old not only knows all her letter sounds, but can distinguish her vowels from her constanents and is beginning to build small words such as cat and pig on her own.  With the math circus she is even beginning to understand addition.  I have little to no guilt when she watches these videos when they are so educational.",1173571200,,634,4.338983050847458
2519939,5,B000EHQU1W,"These DVDs are the best educational value that I have purchased in the last few months. The DVDs are very entertaining also and my three year old (40 months) son picked up reading and spelling simple words within a month. Now he has picked up the phonics concepts from Word Factory 2. He also enjoys watching Story Book factory.

The word games in the DVDs reinforce the concepts presented and it is a lot of fun!

2519940,5,B000EHQU1W,"These videos are wonderful. My daughter is 5 and in kindergarten. She is a tactile (hands-on/visual) learner and was having trouble learning to read. We bought these at Christmas time and it is now February and she is reading!! I also bought the book ""Teach your child to read in 20 easy lessons."" I credit the book with a lot of her progress, but she wouldn't have been able to even begin those book lessons without having first seen these videos. She definitely memorized her letter sounds because of them.

Also, the math circus is great. She has begun reciting addition sums and can count to 100 by 10's. I wish Leapfrog would continue and make even more advanced videos!

Get this. You won't regret it.",1172102400,,707,4.603174603174603
2519941,5,B000EHQU1W,"My kids are hooked on these videos.  They are a great way to introduce the alphabet and reading without directly teaching it, especilly for the reluctant learner.  My kids are 2-5 and there is a video geared for each age but they love them all.  My 5 year old walks around repeating the spelling for all the words he has learned via the videos this and the Hooked on Phonics Kindergarten are a great pair!",1171238400,,405,4.373333333333333
2519942,5,B000EHQU1W,I have twin 3 year olds.  They are in their first year of preschool.  They have both had some minor issues with having the attention span to even sit down to learn their abc's.  Within about 2 weeks of them watching the Letter Factory which was given to us by a friend.  Not only do they both know the alphabet but they can also tell me what sound each letter has.  In fact if they get stuck on which letter they are looking for all I have to do is say the sound and then they know exactly which letter goes with it.  Even my 7 year old enjoys watching these dvd's and usually picks up on something new each time.  I ended up buying this whole set and found that it is just fantastic.  This set is an absolute must!!!!!  Mere words cannot describe how wonderful I feel about this set.,1170633600,,784,4.105263157894737
2519943,5,B000EHQU1W,"I bought this set for my 4 year old daughter. We started with the Letter Factory  DVD. She had already learned her alphabets but not the sounds. Within one week she had the sounds down. When we did our flash cards she would say the letter and the sound with ease. When talking she would say that word starts with a B and then would make the B sound. If my shirt had letters on it she would read them out to me along with the sounds. Love it as it helped me teacher her as well.

 After the Letter Factory DVD we moved on to the  Math DVD. She had great interest, she excelled in her numbers, counting, memorizing them when we do flash cards. Grasping at adding numbers together. We now have moved on to She is so eager to learn to read she was asking to move on to the next DVD. She has great interest in them and I love it as I am very pleased how fast she has excelled. I highly recommend this set. You and your

kid(s) will both be happy with this set.",1168473600,,955,3.979057591623037
2519944,4,B000EHQU1W,I have a long commute with a 3 year old who chatters away which is great and I often get home late with no time to review what she has learned for the day.  These DVDs are a great use of the commute time as she can watch them in the car and we can sing and bond... its great.  The best part is that she is learning and I can see it as a three year old is not a great historian as to what happened during her day.,1168387200,,412,3.566666666666667
2519945,4,B000EHQU1W,My daugher grabbed the 1st dvd on Cristmas and pulled it out of the package.  It was in there so tightly that it broke.  These kids dvd's are not for use by children!!!,1168300800,,168,4.0606060606060606
2519946,5,B000EHQU1W,"Our 4 year old granddaughter has watched the ""Letter Factory"" many, many times and now knows the sounds of all of the letters of the alphabet.  She is just now beginning to watch the ""Talking Words Factory.""  I am convinced that she will be reading at first grade level within a year with the help of these videos (and her one-time schoolteacher grandmother).",1168300800,,359,4.682539682539683

One day when we were out my oldest turned to me and said, ""Sh..Sherry. Mamaw's name is a complex word."" Sometimes you can teach and talk until your blue in the face, and they just don't understand.  Technology, used in moderation, can be a very useful tool to helping your kids understand hard to explain concepts.  I teach 6th grade...If I ever taught kindergarten or first, Leap Frog would be a wonderful tool for my classroom.",1167782400,,538,4.621052631578947
2519949,5,B000EHQU1W,For children learning to read this package is outstanding.  I was hesitant that the video about letters would be too simple for my 5 year old...but with the sounds and songs associated with each letter it is great. All the videos build upon one another so as a package it is wonderful.  From learning letters for younger kids to learning to put complex words together for more advanced it is a great package to add to your library.,1163030400,5,431,4.512820512820513

I have twin toddlers who just happen to love frogs and enjoy watching the Talking Words Factory/Phonics video over and over.

Are there plans to make any new ones?  I think it would be nice to have one on safety/stranger danger, fire and earth quake safety.  One on caring for pets, rescuing animals and having compassion for other living things. Thank you so much for having such great learning ideas for young children.
