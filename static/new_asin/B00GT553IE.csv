6111828,5,B00GT553IE,"A mix of the best of Bollywood, Hollywood and indie films, made by a the protean Danny Boyle who seems always unafraid to tackle new genres and forms.

I find the first 80% flat-out magnificent; Dickens set in India, as a street urchin spins his horrifying tale, intercut with his unlikely success on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" The ending is a bit more Hollywood than indie, but even if it could be accused of being manipulative, it did make me cry. There's an honest sweetness, bravery and energy to the film-making and acting that's endlessly infectious.",1459209600,,581,4.752475247524752

8627305,5,B00GT553IE,"While I gave this movie 5 stars for it's critical achievements it was a very difficult movie for me to watch.  Seeing the abject poverty of the people and the cruelty with which the central character was treated were painful for me to witness.
But, I loved the technique of using the interrogation over the winning of the Millionaire program to reveal flashbacks of how he came to know the answers and the difficult life lessons that he learned them through!
Dev Patel was relatively new on the scene when this movie came out, but has since proven himself to be able to carry a movie.  He is very likeable and very easy to watch on screen.  Overall, the movie is very life affirming and shows the strength in the human spirit.",1503878400,,726,4.484848484848484
