487448,4,6302637856,"Like other movies by this director, Close-Up moves slowly but somehow develops a quiet momentum that continues after the screen goes dark.  I think this is partly due to Kiarostami's sincerity. He feels a genuine interest and affection for his characters, and his movies can give you a powerful sense that yes, their lives are really like that, revealed in repetitions and small struggles.

The New Yorker excerpt quoted above suggests that Close-Up contains a protest against religious authority in Iran.  I don't see this as a main theme.  There may be some subtle reading on which post revolutionary Iranian society is criticized, but the Islamic judge in the trial appears as a fair minded man and not in the least a zealot.  He helps bring about a satisfying resolution.  Of all the characters it's the journalist who comes off looking most like a shabby opportunist.",1193788800,3,872,4.938356164383562
487449,5,6302637856,"This brilliant dramatic re-creation of an unusual case of criminal impersonation examines the conceits of cinema on one hand, but also the state of post-revolutionary Iranian society, where dire poverty and lack of opportunities can crush aspirations, artistic or otherwise. The writer-director, Abbas Kiarostami (""A Taste of Cherry""), read about Sabzian's predicament in a magazine article, decided to film the trial, and then asked everyone involved to play themselves. A fascinating mash-up of reality and artifice, ""Close-Up"" is a minor miracle of engaged storytelling whose compassionate final minutes will leave an indelible impression.",1184112000,5,642,5.913978494623656
487450,5,6302637856,"A man on a bus gets mistaken for the famous Iranian filmmaker Mohssen Makhmalbaf, and he pretends to be him for a while, ingratiating himself into the life of a family by speaking of a project he is working on.  He's not in it for the money, though he borrows taxi fare and is given food.  It's the sense of being someone, someone who matters, someone who these people he has come to care about will look up to.  When another Iranian filmmaker hears about the trial for this alleged conman, he asks permission to film it and follows up by reconstructing elements of the case, using the actual perpetrator as his main actor.

I don't want to give away more of the situation, captured here in a unique blend of documentary and fiction.  What I do want to give is a personal account of my experience with this film, that I hope will motivate a few to take a look -- and to be patient. The film doesn't work its magic right away -- and in fact the beginning of the film can be somewhat disorienting.

Kiarostami has a way of finding the fantastic in the mundane. Somehow, he sets up his films in such a way that I can find myself for the most part merely interested wondering what it is all about, and then suddenly surprised to find myself overwhelmed, surprised by an emotional response that was not manipulated from me with music but somehow, mysteriously. This happened to me while watching ABC Africa, and even more powerfully during this film. His style, the way he achieves this, can almost be thought of as an anti-style -- I know that may not make a lot of sense, but it would take longer than I have here to make clear what I am thinking when I say this. It seems like he is doing very little, but the effect is (in my experience) magical, unexplainable and overwhelming. (For those familiar with Paul Schrader's provocative&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/work/dp/0306803356/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">work</a>&nbsp;on ""transcendental style"" in Bresson, Ozu and Dreyer, I'd suggest Kiarostami as another who works in this vein -- but whose work is quite distinct from these three).

I'll admit, I'm biased. I've become fascinated by the work of Kiarostami in the past few years. Plus, I am very much drawn to films where reality and fiction intersect and overlap in interesting ways. Still, I'm convinced that with a bit of patience -- if you just give yourself the time to let the film work on you without bringing to it expectations that it won't fulfil -- anyone would be overwhelmed by the marvelous simplicity of this film.

I'm very excited to hear that Criterion is re-releasing this film, and hope that it manages to receive wider attention and acclaim. Here's what to expect on the Criterion dvd release:

-a new, restored high-definition digital transfer
-an audio commentary by Mehrnaz Saeed-Vafa and Jonathan Rosenbaum, authors of Abbas Kiarostami
-The Traveler, a notable early feature by director Abbas Kiarostami
-""Close-up"" Long Shot, a forty-five-minute documentary on Close-up's central figure, Hossein Sabzian, five years after Kiarostami's film
-a new video interview with Kiarostami
-A Walk with Kiarostami (2003), a thirty-two-minute documentary portrait of the director by Iranian film professor Jamsheed Akrami
-a new and improved English subtitle translation
-and a booklet featuring an essay by film scholar Godfrey Cheshire",1103932800,26,3400,5.0035398230088495
487451,4,6302637856,"Elegant, mystifying, sad, beautful, these are just some of the words and feelings which come to mind having watched Close Up.  The mixing of genres; is it fact, is it fiction etc. all leave you wondering afterwards, asking yourself what is reality, what is fiction?
That a movie as deceptively simple as this one has the power to stimulate one's mind in such a profound way is a great tribute to the filmaker.  It also goes to show that there is a part of our brains, by-passed by almost all contemporary, Western cinema, which is open to simple stories about humble humanity and it's wayard dreams.
If all this sounds a little bit o.t.t., then watch the movie for yourself, allow it wash over you and I guarantee you will get an itch somewhere deep in your head, the part which actually makes you human.",1070928000,7,804,4.537931034482758

In fact, just to be fair, on several occasions I even invited friends and family to watch the movie with me.... Only to find myself bombarded by derogatory remarks.
This movie is 100 times worst than the ""Taste of Cherry"".

This movie is simple yet it is the ultimate complexity with many layers above layers. It is a movie that tells the true story of a human being, how we think and how we look at ourselves. I am amazed by the effect this movie has had on me since a couple of years ago when I watched it. It is about poor and wealthy, sophistication versus naiveness, honesty versus pretension. I cannot explain what this movie is any further. This movie is not for everyone. You should appreciate art and true cinema to able to enjoy this masterpiece.",1501977600,,665,4.459016393442623

7828368,5,6302637856,"This extraordinary Iranian film follows the real-life trial of a man who impersonated film-maker Moshen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film.

Most of the characters act themselves, including the judge, the impersonator, and the members of the deceived family. The style is rather drab, which gives a very realistic sense of ordinary people caught up in an unusual situation. The characters all have a certain softness, a kindness toward each other that I found very compelling.

In these days when the United States and Iran are such geo-political enemies, it was comforting for me to see how human and humane the Iranians all were.
