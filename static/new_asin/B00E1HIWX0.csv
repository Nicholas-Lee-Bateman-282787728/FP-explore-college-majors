8600030,1,B00E1HIWX0,"I too bought this dvd set at Target. I am usually careful and read reviews before I purchase DVDs but I received a gift card and was really excited to try a new dvd. I love barre, yoga, and pilates and was literally suckered in. The minutes for the work out is off as well from the description from Amazon. It has a 30 min pilates blend, 45 min barre pilates, 40 min yoga flow, and 20 min yoga fusion. As the other reviewer mentioned, the pictures on the dvd is nothing like the actual dvd. Also there is no way of knowing unless you open up the dvd and see it for yourself. The production looks older at least the 2 DVDs I looked at. And probably were old workouts put together and Gaiam claims this new dvd set. So please be careful. I wanted to warn people before they waste their money esp. If this is not what you wanted. Don't be a sucker like me. I truly learned my lesson and should have done my homework. Never judge by anyone or thing by it's cover.",1386633600,15,959,4.1063829787234045
8600031,1,B00E1HIWX0,"I bought this DVD set at Target.  I love barre workouts, and am trying to learn more about yoga, so I thought this set would be perfect for me.  What they don't tell you is that this contains 4 DVDs that have been released before - and the newest one was released in 2003!  Jennifer Kries is one of the instructors, so it's not all bad.  But I do think that they should disclose what is in the package before you purchase it sight unseen.  There is no relation to cover shot to what really is in the DVD.",1382227200,23,504,4.05050505050505
