3457310,5,B001AQBGM4,"I would definitely recommend getting this season.  I still have not seen the last 2 episodes, but LOVED each & every 11 episodes of this season that I did see so far.  Season 3 took me back some, I didn't care for it, not very funny & too much sex & violence.  Season 4 takes you back to the craziness & sheer laugh out loud humor that the first 2 seasons created.  Love Celia being a drug addict, this is so funny & Elizabeth Perkins is a genius at being funny.  Her daughter is hilarious also & so is Doug & his fixation on finding ""Mermax"".  I thought Nancy's character was great again & didn't portray her as being so promiscuous & not very moral as I thought Season 3 did.  I found myself enjoying Nancy again & Silas is now a very handsome young man.  They could have left out the masturbation of Shane over finding naked pics of Nancy as a very young woman.  To me, there is nothing ever funny about a situation like that & too over the top.  Stuff like that shouldn't even be portrayed, never funny & repulsive even.  My fav character of all is still Celia.  MANY funny scenes of her drug addiction & she should win an award for her character.  I found myself marveling how GREAT Mark Louise Parker (Nancy Botwin) looks for being in her mid 40's.  She's had to have work done & what a magnificent job.  She looks naturally young enuf, face & body, to pass for a woman 20 yrs younger.  In one scene without any makeup she almost could have looked 19.  Maybe she's never tanned that pale skin, idk, but kudos to her, she is the best looking 40 something woman I've ever seen.  Her body looks like a teenagers.  Can't imagine Billy Crudup dumping her for a much younger Clare Danes, she has nothing over Mary.  And to think she's had at least one child, unfreakinbelievable....  This season is a must see.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue watching after the bust of S3, but now I can't wait for S5.  Also like the addition of Nancy's father-in-law & her new mayor drug cartel boyfriend. Andy & Silas are still a good addition & Shane too, minus the naked pics of Nancy.  This is one of the best shows on tv!",1225065600,8,2118,4.25062656641604
3457311,5,B001AQBGM4,"for my favorite tv show.  Yes, this season was a major departure from the original premise of the show, some people may be put off by how different it is.  It's more violent, more disturbing, and much more intense.  But it had me on the edge of my seat during almost every episode and I loved the new additions to the cast, specifically Demian Bichir.  Mary-Louise Parker was phenomenal, and I loved the direction Andy's (Justin Kirk) character took. There is still humor, but it's much less zany.  My one criticism is what they did with Doug - he simply doesn't fit in well outside of Agrestic.  But Nancy's progression from small-time dealer to a player in a Mexican drug cartel and its moral implications whose fascinating to watch, and Jenji Kohan turned in a terrific finale, as usual.",1222992000,46,790,4.64748201438849
3457312,3,B001AQBGM4,"In Season 4 of ""Weeds,"" Nancy Botwin, her sons Silas and Shane, and her brother-in-law Andy relocate to a small California town located near the Mexican border. Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) continues working for Guillermo (Guillermo Diaz), first by trafficking across the border and then by managing a maternity store that serves as a front for smuggling drugs and various other illegal things. Midway through the season, Nancy discovers that there's a tunnel in the floor of the store's back room that leads to Mexico. Her curiosity eventually gets the best of her, and she investigates the mysterious tunnel more thoroughly. She comes face to face with Guillermo's boss (Demian Bichir), who also happens to be the mayor of Tijuana, and Nancy ends up falling hard for him. However, when the federal government comes knocking on Nancy's door for information, she finds herself in a bit of a predicament.

For me, Season 4 just wasn't as good as the previous seasons of the show. At first I was excited to see Nancy and her family in new surroundings, but I thought most of the season was pretty lackluster. There are some funny subplots including Celia's drug addiction, Silas's relationship with an older woman (Julie Bowen), Andy's coyote operation, and Doug's fixation with ""Mermax,"" an illegal immigrant. I also enjoyed watching Bichir on the show: he was an excellent addition to the cast this season. However, Nancy's character really fell apart in my eyes, and obviously she is the most integral part of the show, so that kind of ruined the whole season for me. The series finale was odd and the last few moments were definitely unexpected, but still kind of disappointing. I hope ""Weeds"" gets its act together for Season 5, or I will have a hard time tuning in every week.",1221436800,35,1778,4.867986798679868

Sometimes, I wonder if the writers maybe took drugs at some point -- and to be sure, the drug trade is characterized by unappealing violence -- but when the series devolves into a campy T&A or pseudo-soft-porn sitcom painted on the background-canvas of Mary Jay, its entertainment value soars.",1463356800,,372,5.508771929824562

3457350,3,B001AQBGM4,"Season 1 came out as pro-Cannabis show, even the extras promoted growing of a special crop of plants.  Great cast of people and the music for the opening and closing credits was wonderful and diverse.  This continued through much of the next two seasons with all the growing pains of just living, except you had that business of Mom selling pot to save the house/home.  The fourth season was a rehash of reefer madness. ""Marijuana selling is the gateway drug to all sorts of illicit crime and irresponsibility.""  The characters that made the show were seen less and less or disappeared altogether and the ones that make you cringe or you wanted to see get capped are there for every episode.  Worse, all the characters just get dingier and they lost those great qualities that made them who they are, which by Season 4, they have evolved out of character.  This is the last Season I watched and cannot see how they were able to get this aired for another couple of seasons after.",1453680000,,979,4.597701149425287

3457399,3,B001AQBGM4,"Just finished Season 4.  I'm on a ""Weeds"" marathon running right through all the seasons.  First, I noticed that since Season 3, Elizabeth Perkins got fatter and some sort of facial implants and Mary Louise Parker got even thinner and definitely had some facial work done.  It was a bit distracting and I am sorry to see the once-gorgeous Perkins looking so slovenly as her character becomes an addict.  The Season as a whole is much darker than the earlier 3 as the Weeds ensemble leaves the burbs behind and heads for the CA border to get into bed figuratively and literally with some serious drug cartel smugglers. Nancy Botwin has officially bombed out as a Mom. She becomes totally insensitive to her sons' needs and risks her life recklessly with no more excuses that she has to do this for their sakes.  She likes the thrills.  Note again the similarity to ""Breaking Bad""s Walter White.  She gets involved with a major drug dealer and its hard to tell if its love or self-protection. Her two sons are respectively a 17 year old drug dealer shacked up with a 40-something mom, and a 13- year old who is now using drugs and having 3-somes with schoolmates.  This is a comedy but not for the family or those sensitive to violence, porn, or sensitivity to seeing very young children engaged in very inappropriate behavior.",1407801600,,1325,4.656652360515022

3457441,4,B001AQBGM4,"I felt like Weeds took a very strange turn in the latest season I watched. Season 4 is a major departure from a simple suburban mother doing what it takes to support her family. Now, Nancy gets involved in a major drug running operation, while the characters on her periphery go in all sorts of different directions. Some of these sub-plots driven by her family and friends were witty, others maddening, and just a few were ridiculous.

The storyline is interesting and near impossible to turn away from, though. I felt that some elements were a little implausible - not that a person expects total realism in this sort of show. The ease of slipping back and forth across the border, for instance, not to mention the speed at which Nancy's relationship with Esteban unfolds. This season also dropped a big bomb at the end.

Without giving anything away, it definitely turned the show in an interesting direction, but seemed a bit contrived. I have very mixed feelings, but I think season 4 is good enough to make longtime fans and newcomers like myself keep watching.",1355702400,,1067,4.731182795698925

This season is where the comedy starts to disappear as the Botwins are fugitives hiding out near the Mexican border. The drama is turned up a notch but the switch in supporting characters makes the show rather worse for wear. As Celia Hoades exits we no longer have a villain/nemesis that we can have a hearty laugh at. Instead there's an attempt at creating a sense of danger in breezy 24-minute chunks. It doesn't really work, and this is where Weeds starts to slide into the pits.

There are glitches, freezes, and the DVDs themselves have black marks on them around the edges of the discs. Judging by the other customer reviews, I'm not the first to encounter these problems. I'd really like to own all of the seasons of Weeds since it's one of my favorite shows, so this is a real bummer.

As a side note, this set came taped up. The first one didn't, and it's a pointless and irritating addition since removing the tape actually peeled some of the packaging artwork off with it and apparently did nothing to keep the DVDs safe. There were also a couple of gray foam cushion things inside that were just as unnecessary. What would be really helpful is if they would redesign the packaging to allow separate spaces for every DVD, rather than having the third DVD overlap the second.

I did enjoy the first three seasons, as I am a huge fan of Mary-Louise Parker (West Wing is good if you also enjoy her).  But this made the story a little more gritty and covered another side of the drug world.  It also touches on immigration from Mexico to the US.  I liked how the mention how terrible conditions are when coming across the border, how just because you are in the drug world doesn't mean you are not using the money for good, and once again just how rotten some people can be.

3457481,3,B001AQBGM4,"First off the production value on the Blu-ray is top notch. The video and sound on these discs are superb, although I haven't watched any of the extras.

I had great hopes for Weeds after the destruction of Agrestic and the uneven season three. It seemed that a true break from the stale format of the show could be a good jumping off point into the new season. Unfortunately the show continues to be uneven and disappointing even after a move to Ren Mar.

All in all, even a subpar Weeds is better than 90% of the TV on regular cable and the networks. It's only after the great first two seasons that Weeds starts to show some fatigue. Below I tried to hit on what I thought were the highs and lows of the season. Which obviously could spoil some things if you haven't watched it.

The good: Albert Brooks does a great job as the despicable Uncle Lenny. Doug and 'El Andy' start up their own coyote business, running illegals across the border. Doug and Silas try to start up their own medical marijuana shop. Doug and Andy end up in a love triangle with one of the illegals.

The so-so: Nancy tries running drugs for Guillermo across the Tijuana border and starts up a maternity store-front for a drug tunnel. Celia reaches rock bottom and develops an addiction problem after begging for a job from Nancy. Shane uses violence and selling drugs to be the cool kid at his new school. Nancy has a relationship with the drug boss, Esteban.

The bad: The Hodes dysfunction and Isabella trying to decide which parent is better to live with. Silas relationship with a woman his mom's age and selling MJ at the cheese shop. Nancy going to the DEA when she discovers guns and women are being smuggled through the tunnel. The relationship issues between Nancy and Andy.

For me the main story lines were just too out there and uninteresting and the side plots with the family aren't given enough air time.",1265155200,,1897,4.5

Season 1 when I had Showtime and seasons 2 and 3 on DVD purchased here at Amazon. Curiously, lately when I've placed something in my cart to be purchased at a later date, the following day or so the price increases signifcantly as was the case for season 4. When I placed it in my cart 2 days ago it was $9.99 but today it shot up to $19.99. I've removed it from my cart until I see a price drop.

3457492,3,B001AQBGM4,"I think this series has ""outrageously"" outraged its own self as a full out no-holds-barred parody.  Now Nancy Botwin and family move to a borderland seaside town near San Diego. She seeks out her father-in-law, who is of course a gambling ner-do-well, played sardonically by Albert Brooks. He quickly moves out of the story, Nancy has a hot affair w/ a Mexican dictator/gangster, one son gets an older lover who sells pot in her once unpopular cheese shop that refused to sell hoagies, the other son is the schoolyard stud. And Andy, I guess the writer's gave up on him. Exausted and bored, me too!

3457495,5,B001AQBGM4,"A lot of people didn't like Season 4 of Weeds, but as someone who watched all of the seasons in a 2 week time frame, I don't see where all the criticism comes from.  Yes, it is different but isn't that what keeps us coming back?  The show has to evolve or it would get old.  I love the Mexico connection and all the new characters.  After watching Season 5, it does appear Season 4 was more an introduction of the new storyline and then Season 5 takes it to the next level.

As a mother, I am a bit uncomfortable with the storyline of the oldest son's involvement in selling the drugs - but other than that Weeds is just a great show that is high on the entertainment spectrum. Mary Louise cracks me up - cool under pressure and Kevin Nealon is at his best.  If you have never watched this series, get all seasons and enjoy the ride!",1255996800,,833,4.142857142857143

3457498,2,B001AQBGM4,"Was a fan of Seasons 1&2 (and even 3, sort of), I just can't sympathize with the main character any more.  Lilting around in a constant state of exasperation shoving the ever present stupid plastic starbucks cup into her cavernous joker-mouth.  Exasperation being her only state of existence is tiring as hell to watch, not entertaining.

And I do allow a little bending of reality for creative license but can we at least put a little logic in the motivations behind the characters' actions?  For example, why did Nancy stab Guillermo in the back?  And, I know this is asking too much, but can we have at least some kind of theme behind the writing or point to the story or is the narrative simply - exasperated lady goes through life making decisions that make her more exasperated.

Kevin Nealon, Andy, the youngest son remain funny but their side plots are almost as bad as the main one.  So much fun could have come from keeping them in Agrestic but instead we're supposed to buy the idea that a suburban mom will tumble into a world of crime from selling a little weed on the side.",1254873600,5,1087,4.51530612244898

It is extremely well done, Mary-Louise Parker is gorgeous and the rest of the cast great but the whole thing does have a sheen of darkness to it since it does glorify trafficking that I am not too sure what to do about it. It is worth to explore, some episodes are really great but the overall theme is not that appealing. Since it is supposed to be a comedy, there are too many passages of dark humour and a more light approach could have helped it. Approach with caution.",1253664000,2,569,4.229357798165138

No more.

Had this been season 1, I wouldn't have watched Season 2. However, I'm still hooked and have to continue to see how things play out, so I'll be watching more. But by this season, the only characters I don't dislike are Conrad and Celia.

Albert Brooks? Not funny at all. Not even a little.

3457506,4,B001AQBGM4,"Weeds season 4 is a rather interesting beast in how dramatic a change the show has undergone.  No longer does the show revolve around the suburban mockings of a pot dealing soccer mom, but instead revolves around drug (among other things) trafficking.  While this season did feel fresh (let's be honest the idea was starting to get stale), it also kind of left me hating the main character.  While she has always been on the border of moral person trying to help her family, and immoral thrill seeker, this season really pushed her far beyond someone I care about.  Sure there's a few moments of morality, but the reality is they were forced.  Frankly, at this point, Nancy has consistently ignore her children, put them in danger, and raised a teenager who wants to do nothing but grow pot, with a young barely teenager having threesomes.

So, with all of my complaints, why am I giving this a four stars?  Well, the show is still pretty funny, though I'm far more interested in Andy and Kevin Nealon's character than the botwin clan.  I liked where most of the stories went, but can't deny that I just don't feel for Nancy anymore.  Almost everytime she gets in trouble, its her fault.  She could've been out of the game time and time again, but she stays with it, not to help her family, but for her own thrills.  So if you can get past the complete lack of sympathy, they shows very entertaining.

3457518,2,B001AQBGM4,"I enjoyed the first three seasons of 'Weeds' and I found the beginning of the fourth season relatively engaging, Albert Brooks helped. But the show went off the track as the season went on. I have no problem with dark material, 'The Wire' and 'Deadwood' and 'Dexter' I find brilliant in their own ways. But this season of 'Weeds' turned into shallow melodrama where the writers either ran out of ideas or were suffering personal anger issues that they decided to channel through their characters. Almost every character became a hollowed out  version of their former selves. And don't tell me this is some sort of social realism, it was mostly just absurd. I felt angry with the creators and writers of this show by the end as they had taken an interesting show and debased it so horribly.  I honestly don't know how so many people can give this season decent reviews? Either intelligence is being lost or maybe  shallow spectacle is overtaking substance in culture, certainly in this season of 'Weeds'.  Maybe I value some depth to characters more than others. Try and find much of any human heart or compassion in anyone this season, outside of aspects of Andy?  This season of 'Weeds' suffers in contrast with shows like 'Mad Men' and 'Dexter' that handle 'darkness' and social commentary with much more subtley, nuance and insight. But that would be giving Weeds Season 4 too much credit.",1250294400,8,1392,4.783333333333333
3457519,5,B001AQBGM4,"I have been a fan of Weeds since it first premiered on Showtime and have been keeping up with the newest episodes religiously every Monday. Last season, Nancy got in some trouble with a gang of bikers, after escaping drug kingpin U-Turn's fat thumb only to burn down her house in an effort to flee leaving viewers to question ""what's going to happen next?""

In a very unexpected turn of events, Nancy and family are heading to the fictional town of Ren Mar (Oceanside in reality), a small beachside town near the Mexican border. There, she follows Guillermo and begins her new occupation; trafficking across the Mexican border. Soon things evolve and spin out of control when Celia gets released from jail hellbent on incarcerating Nancy, Silas finds companionship in a much older woman, Shane is experiencing abnormal adolescent issues, and Andy as always is along for comedic relief and an occasional solution.

The season starts out strong. By episode 3 the season has established it's new ""roots"". Ren Mar, not Agrestic. Mini-title sequences instead of ""Little Boxes"". And sadly, no Heylia, Conrad or Vaneeta, some of my favorite characters from previous seasons. Things start to pick up around episode 5 when tension starts to heat up between all characters.

Overall, I believe this is a very strong season and would recommend it to anyone. It definitely took a darker, more mature tone on this season, much to some reviewers dislike, but I personally enjoyed the newfound darkness in the show. Drug dealing, while can be portrayed as comical obviously has a dark side that starts to show this season. Things are no longer fun and games in Agrestic, and there was a stir in the fanbase concerning the newer changes. I think they've paid off. I loved the idea of evolution and changing the shows entire premise in a dignified and plausible manner.

Usually in my reviews I have the ""best and worst"" episodes. For this, it's tough because they're all pretty good. The only episode that disappointed me was the anti-climactic finale. Any TV watcher knows the main character isn't going to die. So, sorry Jenji, but that wasn't too big of a cliffhanger.

Best episodes are:

2. Ladies a Charm

Nancy engages in some potentially illegal activity, Bubbie says she wants to die, and Nancy begins to get deeper in the drug world.  A+

5. No Man Is Pudding

Nancy and Celia work a bond out, after she knocks one of her teeth out. The search for missing Andy goes on. Meanwhile, Silas encounters an infestation and Nancy works out a deal with Captain Till to get her off her back.  A

6. Excellent Treasures

Celia gets an unexpected visit from her estranged daughter, Shane auctions off all of Grandpa Lenny's furnishings, and Nancy gets way in over her head when she meets the man in the suit, senor Grande, Esteban Reyes. A

7. Yes I Can

In this dynamic episode, Nancy gets her punishment for stepping out of line, moves 100 pounds of weed, Celia becomes a friend of the benzo's and decides to celebrate her newfound freedom to go on a xanax binge. Oh, and Shane... youch.  A

8. I Am The Table

Silas and Nancy each find new conquests, Guillermo gets put back in line, and Celia becomes an addict.  A+

11. Head Cheese

After an ayahuasca trip, Nancy begins to contemplate her newfound lifestyle. Meanwhile, after dodging Jered from Subway, Silas and Lisa make good work of their newfound cashcow.  A+

12. Till We Meet Again

In the darkest episode of the season, Nancy sets up Guillermo's demise, Celia recovers from her addictions, and we wait impatiently for the next move.  A+",1250121600,,3582,4.747980613893376

If it's always darkest before the dawn, the fifth season finale should be a glorious sunrise (or not!).  I'm addicted and have to ration the shows like candy.  Each character is so well developed ranging from hilarious to terrifying; ancient to pubescent, naughty to nice or perilously lurching toward the former.

3457523,4,B001AQBGM4,"I really wanted to rate this 3 stars but in all honesty I've got to make it 4 stars.  This is because I keep telling myself that this show is stupid and ridiculous and only an idiot would watch it.  Then, of course, this idiot is there the following week taking in the newest episode after swearing that the week before was the last time with this show.  If I were not now watching the newest season, 5, in exactly the same way, I might be able to make myself believe that season 4 was no good but c'mon, even I'm not that thick.

This is a bizarre season.  We leave suburbia for good with the usual cast of characters and take up residence near the Mexican border.  So Nancy now is living much more like an outlaw and no more like a soccer mom.  Nancy becomes involved with a Mexican drug lord and is as over her head as she was when she was involved with the rogue DEA agent. I have never really understood why Nancy had to go into dealing drugs as her employment when she found herself stranded in suburbia as a widowed soccer mom in season one but 4 seasons in, I've given up trying to understand any logic or reason to the characters in this show.

Coming as no surprise is the character who has grown and grown with each season is her brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk).  I say this is no surprise because the two people on the show with substantial success in other (deeper) work are Kirk and Parker herself.  Kirk was the main character on both stage and screen for ANGELS IN AMERICA.  Parker also had a big part in ANGELS IN AMERICA.  That show walked off with just about all the Emmys the year it came out.  It was the poetic masterpiece about America in the time of AIDS.

Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) remains the most witchy, caustic, non-mom, non-wife, non-worker in the show.  If everyone seems to fall in love with Nancy, they fall in hate with Celia.  She is the Nancy antidote.

Shane as the bright kid who has to grow up in this bizarre environment, remains strong on the show.  As usual, he seems more like the parent to Nancy than the child.

The other, usual characters from prior seasons seem more peripheral this time around.  They seem to be just along for the ride and it might be better to just jettison them all together.

I've always liked Parker, Kirk and Perkins as actors.  I viewed all their other work as more substantive than this but there must be some reason I keep watching this show.  Maybe it is just that I like seeing three very talented actors from stage and screen slugging it out in one outrageous situation after another week after week.

3457545,1,B001AQBGM4,"A little note to those who don't want to read this type of critique:
Please don't read it.
Many of you have said that if I don't like racist TV I shouldn't watch the show.
Well, if you don't like anti-racist reviews of light entertainment, then don't read this review.

And to the person who says that I must be the racist, due to my focus and concerns about racial prejudice and stereotyping, please buy a dictionary, or just use a free one online and look up the word ""racism"".  While you are online look up some statistics about race equality or lack thereof in todays society, media, education, criminal justice, pollution, you name it, non-white people still get the short end of the stick in our society.  The facts don't lie.  Don't take my word for it, do your own research, and that includes hiring patterns in Hollywood, which is much more integrated than many parts of our society but still greatly under-represents minorities and presents them very unrealistically even compared to their unrealistic portrayals of white characters.

As of season two this was certainly true of this show, though I believe unintentionally.
I got sick of the stereotypes so I can't speak to it's current state.

At last, more and more people are finally waking up from their hypnotic state and realizing just how atrociously bad this show is.

The quiet elimination of the always-subservient African American characters after the first season was a sad and transparent effort to end the accusations of racist stereotyping that have plagued this show from the beginning.  While it was a relief to see the end of the portrayal of the Elder Black Woman as a classic ""Mammy"" character plucked directly from Hattie McDaniel's oscar winning pitch perfect minstrel show style performance in Gone With the Wind, firing the actors hardly solves the problem.  (My characterization of these minstrel era racist cliches should be taken literally, assuring Nancy repeatedly, ""Don't you worry your pretty little white a** about nothin' Mammy'll take care of everything"" or something to that effect, it's unbelievable I know, watch it and realize how sadly true this is)

Tragically this effort to hide the unintentional racism of the show's all white creators was entirely unsuccessful, as each season seemed to introduce worse and worse examples of this early 20th century style vintage Hollywood racist stereotyping, this time with a nerdy and cowardly south Asian, and an incessant parade of lazy, violent, stupid, sexually insatiable Mexican characters.

The ongoing and seemingly blindly unintentional implied racism of this show continues unabated.
Every time I turn on the show I am shocked that it continues so nakedly.  I have not been able to stomach an entire episode in some years due to the deeply offensive racist stereotypes that seem to plague each and every episode of this show, who's high moral aspirations are betrayed by terrible writing and a vaguely defined premise that seems to continuously deteriorate even in the eyes of it's most ardent fans.

Of interest to those who agree or disagree with my thesis here, is a fascinating and darkly revealing episode of the radio show and podcast ""The Treatment"" half hour interview with Jenji Cohan, the show's creator, a former writer for the Facts of Life and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

There were two of these, and I am referring to the first one, with Jenji alone.  I have not heard the second one in which Jenji is joined by producer Roberto Benabib.

When questioned by the well respected African American film critic Elvis Mitchell as to the ""Mammy"" character and whether the show is perpetuating outdated and negative stereotypes of African Americans, Jenji replies that the dialog of the African Americans is authentic, because she ""knows these people"" due to having spent at least one afternoon either playing dominos or watching games of dominos with some elderly ""black men"" at Venice Beach.

For those who have not been there, Venice beach is far from the heart of Los Angeles' African American community.  Her amazing tale of cultural tourism into this world of authentically black people who play dominos on Venice Beach is to say the least unimpressive.  The crowds at Venice are somewhat integrated, certainly not usually completely all white, but always mostly all white.

This defense was shamefully ignorant and shallow.  Elvis mercifully changed the subject, but I must say, that was one of those moments when I am ashamed to be white.  Go and listen for yourself at the KCRW fm internet archives, if you can stomach the ignorant and idiotic unintended racism.

This show had so much potential, great premise, very topical issue, good cast, sufficient budget (it would seem), yet like so many Showtime endeavors, it came out malformed... a true television abomination.  Someone should make a good show on this subject some day.  I know I would watch it, but I can't stand this racist (and increasingly sexist, but don't get me started on that) expensive garbage.",1245888000,13,5031,4.9749403341288785
3457546,1,B001AQBGM4,"Season 4 brought about huge cast, plot, and setting changes.

[Setting Changes]
Old Setting: Aggrestic, CA near LA  (Fictional affluent suburb)
New Setting: Ren Mar near San Diego/Tijauna (Fictional run down beach town)

[Cast Changes]
Heylia James, Conrad Shepard, and their associates are no longer in the show.  Guillermo, Esteban and other Latino drug dealers are now the main counterpart to the Botwin Family and Friends.
In short Latino drug dealers replaced the African American drug dealer characters.

[Plot Changes]
Much darker, less creative, less humor, more violence, and much more severe moral issues.  Human trafficking, gun running, harder drugs, addiction, sex with minors, etc.

[In Summary]
The writers ran out of creative energy so turned to smut to fill the hole.  Episodes 1-6 were really boring and hard to get through.  Hopefully Season 5 will see a return to the original formula.",1245196800,13,905,5.2727272727272725

3457549,2,B001AQBGM4,"Weeds, Season Four.

The catchy theme song we all loved to sing along with while getting excited for the latest episode is gone, replaced by clever logos and an imaginative script. Too imaginative, to say the least. Remember when Nancy was a bad mother who at least tried to do well by her children? When Doug was always comedy gold, Celia was bitchy but loveable, and Shane was innocent? Sadly, those days are over, folks. Never have I seen a cast once so endearing transform into characters I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Thank God for El Andy, who at least retains his charm and seems to be the only character winning over more audience love with time. Nancy Botwin is now officially a horrible person. One of the fascinations of this show was watching her balance that thin line between Suburbia and the Grasslands while juggling single parenthood. She was imperfect; a poor decision maker for sure, but at least she tried to bridge the gap between her growing(ly distant) sons. Her character has now officially all but given up any effort at all at maternal humanity. She goes through so many men that I've lost count and didn't have time to form any sort of attachment with any of those characters except Conrad, who despite all those seasons of subtle romantic build-up, all but disappears from this latest season. When did Doug become a grouchy demanding irritant? Wasn't he everyone's favorite member of Agrestic? By the way, whatever happened to Agrestic? Oh yeah. Up in flames like everything else in the series. Agrestic played such a central role in the series it was a character unto itself. No more. The Botwins now live by the seaside in Ren-Mar where they engage in plenty of acts that are anything but comical. Celia's character was initially written to be the next-door-neighbor, mother, and wife from hell (and the friend you should never double cross). Over the seasons, her character has melted into sheer terror. There is NOTHING funny about locking your ex-husband in a closet and abusing him. I'm pretty darn liberal when it comes to my sense of humor, but a lot of what is being pawned off as comedy is atrocious and completely amoral beyond belief, even for a TV show. I'm actually insulted that some of this is supposed to be laugh-worthy and frankly, disturbed by the implications. I guess the only realistic aspect of this show now is that Shane and Silas would find their way into the drug underworld relatively early in life given their upbringing. Even Guillermo nosedived into scary. This is certainly NOT the season I'd ever want to watch. The entire thing was blanketed in a darkness so thick and storylines so unpleasant I dare not purchase the season and will gladly forget it ever happened if Season Five can resurrect any shred of credibility to its mangled fate. After all that viewing, it appears the show is indeed made of ticky-tacky and like everything else on TV, looks just the same.",1244937600,34,2938,4.73828125

I do miss the Agrestic and Majestic days and the little boxes, but I quickly got used to the new digs, the new weeds, and the Cheese shop being turned into a front along with the maternity store front.

3457556,5,B001AQBGM4,"weeds is one of the best shows on television and its greatness continues with season 4. this is a slower season with the episode cliffhangers being more cerebral and character driven rather than shocking or thrilling as in the previous seasons. It is also a lot darker but also zanier than the others. When you watch this season more than once a lot of the troubles you have concerning the story arcs or the new direction will disappear. You will find that this was a logical step for each character and what they all go through seems natural for them, yes even Celia's story. Overall, its a great new start and leave plenty of room for this show to get even better.

Mother Thinks the Birds are After Her
Lady's a Charm
The Whole Blah Damn Thing
The Three Coolers
No Man is Pudding
Excellent Treasures
Yes I Can
I am the Table

The Love Circle Overlap

Season four took a definite departure from the safety of Agrestic...a departure to a California border town near Tijuana. Nancy's (Mary-Louise Parker's) involvement with the dangerous/sexy mayor of Tijuana (Demin Bichir) was a nice addition, as was the twisted relationship between Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) and DEA Till (Jack Stehlin), who brilliantly walked the comedy/drama line.  As always, the comedy trio of Andy (Justin Kirk), Doug (Kevin Nealon) and Dean Hodes(Andy Milder)totally paid off. As for the kids Silas (Hunter Parish), Shane (Alexander Gould), and Isabelle (Allie Grant)- they are proving to be fine young actors, holding their own in every lovely scene.

If for some reason you are having doubts as to buying this season, believe me, it is as good if not better than the other 3. I would encourage you to start from season 1 (which is also cheap on amazon.com) so you can see all the character development.

Many times I found myself wondering what the hell Nancy was doing and how could this possibly turn out okay for her in the end?  But that only added to the suspense and my enjoyment.
