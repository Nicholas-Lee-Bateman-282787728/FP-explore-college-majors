8643863,3,B00IO8XU6Q,"The film has two halves. The first half builds character as it effectively draws parallels between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and the Princess (Eleanor Tomlinson). It becomes a classic rescue tale. The second half is more akin to a fight scene from LOTR.

The giants are based on the legend of the Titans. Our characters are very stock and the dialouge was dry. The princess who is supposed to be some independent fighter speaks poetically and is lifeless...Kristen Stewart could have done better. The giants reminded me of Orcs and at times they were rather disgusting.

I wonder who this film was for? For adults the plot is rather simple. I can't imagine the background of Giants who eat people and drop the F-bomb (two headed giant near the end) as being suitable for children. PG-13 indicates that is the appeal factor: Tweens and young teens who would indeed rate it 5 stars.

This production is riding the coattails of the successful fairy tale productions that preceded it. It doesn't have a good script. It lacks crisp dialouge. It doesn't have the star appeal. It is for the younger generation who only care about the CG effects for which I will give it 3 stars.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1446940800,,1210,4.720379146919432
