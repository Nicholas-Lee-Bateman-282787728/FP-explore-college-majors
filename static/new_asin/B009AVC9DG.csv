5309629,5,B009AVC9DG,After i saw that this was coming to dvd and i beat the first game of t trails in the say was very well done beautiful animation but let me tell something before you buy this dvd. in order to understand what happens in this anime you have to play the game that take place before this or ells you will feel out of place and it won't make any seance. but all and all if you had played that game or not its a very good anime. It will just make a lot more seance if you play the game first.,1356134400,4,485,3.764705882352941

5309631,3,B009AVC9DG,"I rented this movie and am not sure if this is the same thing amazon is selling but it has the same picture on the disc as shown. Unfortunately it doesn't show how long the disc is, it's a rental, but after watching the movie I spent some time looking for another part to this since it seems there should be more to the story. It does not seem complete.

The fighting scenes and story were good...if you can get over the one character having a ""I can fight you and win"" attitude without actually being able to deliver.

I also have to say that I liked the way the story was drawn with the exception of all the characters having those awful slits for mouths. And what is up with those noses? It really distracted me from the story.",1355616000,2,730,4.207142857142857
5309632,4,B009AVC9DG,"Perhaps I'm being paranoid, but Amazon says this is the ""Complete Collection"" but nowhere on the case (front or back) does it say this.  So, there is a chance they made a mistake.

Also, if you search for the title in Japanese on Amazon Japan, there is no such title.  The closest are volumes 1 and 2 of an OAV that was released 2011 and 2012.  I guess this could be volumes 1 and 2 bundled together -- I'm not sure.  If so, there could be other OAVs after; so probably 'complete' would not be correct.

I'm not sure if I can post links here, but if you search for ""oav"" and the Japanese title, then you should find the Japanese publisher's web site which has trailers, etc.",1353196800,10,674,4.2265625
5309633,5,B009AVC9DG,"Ok I just have to get on here and say this, thank you Sentai for putting this out. I'm a USA anime Otaku and I tell you I got this game on PSP and was annoyed and depressed when I found out that there was a second and third game for PSP in Japan but Vita has made it impossible for a PSP USA release of 2 and 3. No mentions yet of a Vita port either so I'm really happy that this anime was done. I can sit back and enjoy a great storyline and hopefully this goes through all of it. If anyone is wanting to get a head start on it they can search for the game on PSP of the same title. It's a great JRPG and I'm still saddened that most great JRPGs don't make it to US or at least their sequels don't. Will do a full review on this one once I get to watch it so seeya again in December.",1349395200,9,784,3.6726190476190474
5309660,4,B009AVC9DG,"My boyfriend and I liked this movie quite a lot, but it seems to be only a part of the whole thing. Is this really the complete collection?",1392681600,2,139,4.0

5309662,5,B009AVC9DG,"Romance comes first to mind with me...  Warriors defending the world from evil and only one place defends itself.  But during their work one really awesome boy grows up forgetting his memory until he comes to him somehow and he needs to break away from his best friend you is a young girl growing up and they find love beginning to surface but he wants to go his own way and clear up his past before he moves on so he kisses her with a sleeping drug and slips away...

Many months go by but she keeps looking for him and finally she joins him with so much action and adventure it is like i am falling off my seat seeing her get thrown off a cliff and he comes to rescue with a hook and line and swings her around to safety under the enemy's nose... Really cool moves they both develop while separated but we find she does not plan to leave him once she returns a real kiss!  This makes it cooler and more impressive but i have to wait for more films to be made ?  rats i want more!",1370131200,,981,4.036082474226804

5309665,1,B009AVC9DG,"I played the game so I thought the anime might be fun, but I was oh so wrong. Do not buy this piece of crap anime if you have kids. It shows just how far Falcom has grown loose in its morals to sell us cheap porn. Had I known the anime was chock full of this crap, I would have never bought it. Plus, the anime itself wasn't very well-drawn and the Japanese voices of the characters didn't sound like the games at all...

The seller was awesome though...",1361836800,,454,4.044444444444444

5309667,4,B009AVC9DG,To start off I'm not a huge hardcore anime fan. I enjoy it and and bought this as a total shot in the dark. I found it to be quite good. It's not as aggressive as other series out there. This is a good series to start for someone who is looking to start into anime.,1359849600,,265,3.75
5309668,1,B009AVC9DG,"Was really looking forward to watching this only to be upset when I popped it in.  I tried to change the language from english to japanese but, the function does not work on the disc.  Also, when I attempted playing the movie despite that it gives me subtitles along with the english language.  This is extremely annoying since the dialog and subtitles do not match and I hate watching anime in english in the first place.  I will be returning this and if possible I will get another copy to see if it was just a problem with that disc (though I have never experienced anything like this with any DVD or BD).  If it turns out that it was just the disc I'll amend this review.  Until then I can't give a faulty product a good rating.",1358208000,2,732,4.268115942028985

8538711,4,B009AVC9DG,"This collection is purely for fans of the Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky game from Falcom. It really seems to be kind of a love letter to the fans. It summarizes the first half of the second game while reimagining a few plot-points. It's pure fan service, and I really appreciate Falcom for giving us the characters in this format.

My only quibble is with the translation of a couple of parts of the English dub. There are 3 specific spots that are pretty cringey in terms of the dub, and it seems like they kind of rushed it out without editing it fully. But if you can look past those parts the dub is okay. I don't understand Japanese, so I can't tell how well it's done.",1500854400,,680,4.230769230769231
8538712,1,B009AVC9DG,"This was nothing like the games. It story is kind of at the end of the first but ends maybe two thirds through the second. They screw up the names of characters and groups. It honestly felt like a lazy attempt and they said ""eh I don't want to work on this any more so let's just sell it this way""",1464393600,,297,3.8852459016393444
8538713,3,B009AVC9DG,"Well, that's not entirely true, as a massive fan of Trails in the Sky and to a lesser extent, Trails of Cold Steel. Purchased this as someone generally not a fan of anime, expecting it to be tolerable at best and leaving myself room to be impressed. Just got left being confused.

The animation was alright to good.
Voice actors were fine apart from Estelle, who had a sorority girl feel to her
Estellle... Really, did you really need to turn her from a realistic, strong female character that wasn't a man in a woman's body, into a damsel in distress?
Olivier... Well, got my one fruity speech about love and beauty. Passing grade.

Most of all, I wondered why the movie started at the very end of first chapter, when the case clearly summarized and implied that the movie was about the first chapter. I checked the case three times for another DVD, and triplechecked that it wasn't double-sided. Just confused. Although I suppose even at the movie's fast pace, you'd need like, 6 hours at a bare minimum to cover the major events in second chapter, not to mention first.

Worth my dollar to show my support of the franchise, and it didn't completely destroy my many fond memories of Trails in the Sky. Partial success.

The most disappointing part of the entire movie was, after the hot springs scene (which was obviously coming because anime and fanservice), I did not get to see dozens of creepy sheep combine into one gigantic mecha-sheep. They even teased me with creepy sheep before that scene! That alone removes one star. Truly sadistic, I demand my sheep level 600%.

Why does Joshua have a whip?

Why is Kloe named Klose? Yes I know, translation.

It made me triplecheck that Campanella was not in fact female, being voiced by a clearly female voice actor. He is not.",1457481600,,1803,4.580745341614906
8538714,4,B009AVC9DG,"Okay, so here's the deal. I just ordered this, but I've already seen the movie, so I'm gonna go ahead and review it now.

I gave it four stars. The reason why is simple. I think it was decent overall. It served its purpose, and I came away from it feeling like I had enjoyed the experience. However, I do think it has a lot of room for improvement. It would have been nice if the movie had told the whole story, from the early days of Joshua and Estelle in Rolent all the way up to Weissman's defeat. Unfortunately, it did not.

The bottom line is this. If you can accept it for what it is, then it's actually pretty good. It's not a retelling of the whole Trails in the Sky story. What it is is a shorter version with a lot of events condensed into one hour-and-a-half long movie. I enjoyed it enough to purchase it because it really did feel the same to me at some points as playing the game did. I think they could have portrayed Estelle as stronger and more accomplished than they did, because in the game she is actually really impressive, but as far as her personality goes I think they did an excellent job with it.

4 stars is pretty good considering I heard a lot of negative things about this. I'm glad I took the time to watch it now that I've finished the game. I expect that I will be watching again.",1446595200,,1313,4.161417322834645
