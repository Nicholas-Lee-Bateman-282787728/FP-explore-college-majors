8543082,1,B009NDYS08,"I am an Andy Murray  fan, and as I had missed the live version the US mens final, i ordered the DVD, but was so disappointed that the DVD I received was for the wrong region.
I think Amazon should be aware when someone orders from a certain country, then an alert should show up, if that broadcast is not available in that country eg New Zealad
I would love to see the DVD of Andy Murrays 2012 final, but I can't get it through Amazon Uk, so where can I get it, that I can receive it on NZ  DVD?",1381449600,,495,3.891089108910891
8543083,5,B009NDYS08,"This is the CBS broadcast, featuring Billy Mac (Bill McAtee), Johnny Mac (John McEnroe), and Mary Carillo. Given the great age of tennis that we live in, these matches are classics to own & study (if you are an afficionado of tennis), particularly given the arc that these players have been on the past few years. It's terrific to see how they've changed in the intervening years. To make the viewing easier, the commercials have been removed, so the tennis flows smoothly from game to game.

This was Andy's first major (not giving anything away, since you can see the outcome on the cover). But well worth watching even knowing the final score. An absolute classic match -- one that goes the distance!",1373673600,,703,4.715447154471545

8543085,5,B009NDYS08,"If you watched this final live, you will agree it is one of the best!  I was on the edge of my seat, not knowing who would win, but hoping and praying it would be Andy.  To see him achieve his first grand slam is amazing.",1352937600,,221,3.782608695652174
