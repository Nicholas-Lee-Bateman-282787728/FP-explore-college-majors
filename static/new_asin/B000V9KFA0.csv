8217564,4,B000V9KFA0,"This 1996 TV movie drama is awesome and is probably Cheryl Ladd and Michael Farrell's first roles of all time. Now, I'm just waiting for them to release this flick out on a DVD that will play on any DVD player made here in America!!!!",1481846400,,234,4.222222222222222
8217565,3,B000V9KFA0,"Like most low budget movies you come across for a couple of dollars on DVD, the cover image has nothing to do with the actual 1996 first aired movie, there is no scene with these characters making out in the ocean while one of them holds a gun.  Also like most made for TV movies this one is fairly low  budget but brings a few big names from TV to the movie genre.  The biggest is Nancy Cartwright (Bart and other voices on The Simpsons), she plays the duller more conservative timid sister of a Cheryl Ladd (Charlie's Angels) who is hired to play a joke on a rich guy by his best friend who is a cop and was hanging around the mug shot area when she was arrested.  The rich guy though (Mike Farrell, M*A*S*H), quite likes what he sees, and decides to start dating and soon marries her.  However she likes to spend his money and when he tells her she needs to spend less of it, she doesn't like that, doesn't like it at all!

It's an okay movie but it's the kind of movie that doesn't make much real world sense.  Wouldn't a cop do a more thorough background check on someone his best friend becomes interested in?  Why would a wealthy kid with a much hotter and younger girlfriend want to hook up with someone his father's age and who is married to him.  Wouldn't the odds be from her point of view that he would turn her down because she's old and tell his father thereby ending her lucrative lifestyle?",1465862400,,1406,4.235955056179775

8217567,4,B000V9KFA0,"This 1996 drama flick pertains to a paroled pregnant lady Lucinda(Cheryl Ladd)who tries to start a new life and eventually falls for and marries a wealthy man, Clay Spencer(Michael Farrell), but then when their marriage goes sour, Clay has a change in attitude and Lucinda starts exposing her true colors and starts a passionate affair with her stepson, which becomes a sad story from there on.",1428278400,,394,4.984848484848484

8217571,5,B000V9KFA0,"Cheryl Ladd is stunning and eerily seductive as she disgards her Charlie's Angels personna to play the role of a woman who refuses to be cowed in a man's world and cannot accept true love in the face of acquiring great wealth from her much older husband. She always has a ""Plan B"" and thinks nothing of spending as much as she pleases to please herself at any cost.  When her husband tries to rein her in, the mask of innocence comes completely off and one immediately knows that his days are numbered. In the meantime, Ms. Ladd manipulates, toys with, and seemingly seduces for one fleeting moment the handsome youthful son of her husband (how far they go is left at guesswork). A somewhat homely sister is used as her pawn. When the husband is found murdered from a gunshot, his best friend (Nick Mancuso, a detective) who introduced the deceased to Ladd is determined to prove her guilt. However, no murder weapon can be found; the son becomes a prime suspect; pressure is put on Ladd's sister to implicate her - and through it all Ladd remains deliciously unperturbed. She is as smart as she is beautiful; and IF she is guilty, how did she do it and where is the murder weapon?",1279324800,6,1181,4.493023255813953
8217572,5,B000V9KFA0,Cheryl Ladd is fantastic in this movie.  She plays an ex-convict who is set up with a wealthy businessman as a joke.  They end up falling deeply in love but their relationship goes sour as soon as Lucinda (Cheryl Ladd) becomes comfortable enough to show her true colours.  If you love the suspenseful twisted lifetime movies then this is a great one to own.,1226188800,14,357,4.546875
