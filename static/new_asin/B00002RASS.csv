8184226,4,B00002RASS,"This is one of the rare cases where a sequel proves far superior to the original. Where the original film 'Django' fell short in characterization and plot, the follow-up proves to be not only a powerful action film, but  also a solid, entertaining action feature as well. Franco Nero gives a worn  but passionate performance of an ex-gunfighter who has seen too much death,  but must bring his trusty weapons out of storage to stop murderous  slave-traders. This whole movie, from beginning to end, had a surreal,  other-wordly quality that makes it all seem like a waking nightmare. Scenes  are filled with eerie fog, silent, slowly starving slaves and sudden,  explosive brutality. Portions of this film remind you of Coppola's  'Apocalypse Now' without actually stealing from it. And the opening title  sequence is one of the BEST I've seen in any movie for the last several  years. The Anchor Bay tape is beautiful -- great, clean picture and sound,  although the actual content of the film dosen't lend itself to a lot of  color. And the interview with Nero at the end is revealing and insightful,  and makes you want to hear more from star Nero, who seems like quite a  decent guy. Overall ,a powerful, creepy film -- a rarity for a western. A  super film at a great price! Anchor Bay does it again!",955324800,4,1305,4.712389380530974
