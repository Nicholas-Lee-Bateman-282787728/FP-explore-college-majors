5043967,3,B006ZV6YUI,"Everyone so far has loved this Parsifal. I don't. I admire Kupfer, an outstanding director, but think this, unlike his superior Ring Cycle, is misjudged.

He is an important part of the so called Regietheater movement in Germany: these directors make choices that deliberately fly in the face of any and all traditions. They are hated by many American viewers, but the best productions in this style can be revelatory -- cliches are banished, nothing is taken for granted or easily overlooked, and sometimes inconvenient meanings in the text are laid bare.

But this is more often strange than powerful. Schavernoch's sets are just odd. Wagner's text constantly invokes nature. This need not be shown in a literal or obvious way, but Schavernoch and Kupfer chose a post modern, architectural, cold look, that feels wrong (to me). The Knights of the Grail apparently live in a bank vault; upstage walls shift for Parsifal to enter from an invisible forest having killed a swan (and yes, there's a fake swan) and for Amfortas to return from his bath.

When Gurnemanz and Parsifal walk to the Temple, big walls shift behind them -- it looks like a cop out to me. Wagner wanted what we would call a 'cinematic' effect, the two walking through a landscape and entering the temple. Here, they just look odd walking in place, as the massive sets shift.

Klingsor who is described as living in a magical desert, which he can transform into seductive places to trap unwary Grail Knights, also, in this production, seems to be inhabiting a bank vault. The 'magic garden' where beautiful flowers suddenly morph into gorgeous young ladies who dance to tempt Parsifal, is a TV room, where on innumerable small screens are naked breasts, legs and other alluring parts of the female anatomy (the singers are unseen). It's a comment it seems on video Porn, arousing and frustrating for the 'young lad'. It is meant to soften, or do I mean, harden, him up for the ur-seductress, Kundry, who comes floating in, lying back on the upside down canoe, which has done for Amfortas in the Temple, and for Klingsor in his chamber of evil.

Little Waltraud Meier and huge Paul Elming have to position themselves awkwardly around this, and at one point, Elming trips. Meier, as Kundry, looks like the same person who was serving the knights slavishly in act one, after a shower and a trip to the hair dresser and the mall dress shop. Wouldn't she look a little familiar to Parsifal? He's supposed to be dumb (naive) at this point -- but blind? The scene is mighty dark, as indeed is the whole performance, so details get lost.

In act three we are back in some sort of courtyard at the Grail compound in scene one. The whole point of this scene is that it is Good Friday, the day of Jesus' death and paradoxically the day the earth is born anew with the beauty of nature (those are not my beliefs but Wagner's ideas). However here, spring is sprung with a blueish lightshow behind some transparent windows upstage and, it seems to me that something -- a great deal -- is lost.

Now, I am not saying 'how DAST' someone fail to do a comic book type Parsifal where everything is literally spelled out. I'd be happy to see an unusual treatment and understanding of Wagner's notions (I've seen the Bieto production live, which is, I suspect, too wild for the other reviewers here, but actually responds to everything Wagner asks for, inimitably for sure and in ways he couldn't have predicted but clearly and powerfully). This dark, looming presentation seems to me to miss quite a bit.

Musically, this is nothing much, and again I will be hated for saying it. The orchestra is recorded in a distant acoustic, much of the magic of the opera -- Wagner's highly original scoring, surprising harmonies and the way those long melodies gather themselves together and soar -- is lost. Barenboim has no particular ideas about the work beyond securing a high level of competence and moving fluently.

The Meier fans seem to over look her thinnish sound, lack of a really distinctive timbre and the fact that here she struggles for the highest notes. She's a good actress for an opera singer and a very good looking woman -- but the gloriously sung, haunted and haunting accounts of this complex role I saw from Ludwig and Crespin, and indeed from the amazing Martha Moedl when I was very young, belong to an entirely different and much higher class.

Elming is only OK, Struckmann, as Amfortas, though supposedly in agony and bleeding from his wound, has no trouble vaulting off his canoe and kneeling down center so he can belt his first monologue. Tomlinson is in my opinion the best performer here, a solid voice (though he has to struggle with the high climaxes in act three), and wonderful sense of the text, also a really good actor.

I expect fervent disagreement and these are obviously my tastes and maybe only mine (though I would defend more passionately being unimpressed with this as a musical realization).

I prefer the insane Syberberg film (really haunting images though and a fine musical realization), and to some degree the Lenhoff production. That is not without its irritating oddities but I think it's more interesting consistently than the Kupfer, is at least as well conducted by Nagano (nothing great), has Meier in what I'd consider better form and has two excellent performances: Ventris as Parsifal, and Salminen as Gurnemanz.

But Parsifal might be best encountered aurally so one can produce it in one's head. I love both Knappertsbusch performances, the exceptionally good sounding stereo from '62, with the one of a kind Hotter as Gurnemanz and a fabulous chorus; and the legendary but messier 1951 performance, riveting and moving despite various mishaps, with a great cast. But -- as some will no doubt comment -- too much of me!",1340409600,37,5825,4.772591857000993
5043968,5,B006ZV6YUI,"I had seen other versions of ""Parsifal"" but I do not pretend to be an expert on this complex and amazing work.  This video, however, just blew me away.  I was riveted to the screen.  The great scenes with the Transformation music and the Good Friday spell, as well as the ""crowd"" scenes, are very powerful.  The sets are not all perfect but there is a real emotional jolt in many scenes as portrayed by Kupfer. The music under Barenboim is superb, very consistent, and really delivers the emotional goods. I cannot praise it enough.  He does not rush: everything he does seems calculated to add to the power of the opera. John Tomlinson has sung Titurel before but he deserved a bigger part. He got it here: he has a great voice for Gurnemanz and acts well. He is less musical, however, than Hans Sotin, say.  Waltraud Meier is exceptional as Kundry.  The part seems to be made for her.  She is in her prime and makes the character into something larger than life.  I am not utterly wild about Elming as Parsifal but he is very, very good. I just was musing about how great Jonas Kaufmann would probably be, since he is supposed to sing the part at the Met next year. At least this production does not turn Parsifal into a woman.  Struckmann also makes an excellent Amfortas.  I was disappointed at first by the fact that the flower maidens were not presented live but as images on television screens or monitors. But I can see artistic reasons for doing this and ultimately I felt it worked after all. I wholeheartedly recommend this amazing production.",1340323200,17,1554,4.534050179211469
5043969,4,B006ZV6YUI,"I suppose that had I come to this DVD cold, as it were, I would have been very satisfied with it.  As Mr. Eltzholtz wrote, Waltraud Meier is ""at her thrilling peak"", and the rest of the cast is also excellent -- as of course is Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin.  I had great expectations due to the fact that I was so overwhelmed by the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring with much the same people recorded a year earlier.

But ...

The set of Hans Schavernoch does not work as well as his set for the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring. I am unable to understand what he is trying to say here with his (I suppose one could call it) futuristic design.  His differently futuristic design made great sense with his Ring -- but not here.  As an example, why instead of having the Flowermaidens appear in person, dancing and interacting with Parsifal, are bits of them shown on many television screens?  (Is this Schavernoch's idea or Kupfer's?  Either way it is a loss of dramatic potential.)

The other major problem I have is with the sound.  Warner Classics seems to have remastered the sound for the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring (1991).  I doubt if Euroarts did anything with this Parsifal (1992).  I found the orchestral sound somewhat muffled and distant compared with the vocal sound causing loss of much of the complexities, subtleties, and dare I say it, enjoyment of the music.

And Kupfer put in too many touches that were distracting. It appears to me that his concept was lacking focus.

 It also does not come up to the excellence of the Lehnhoff/Nagano/Opus Arte Parsifal with a cast at least the equal of this, a strong focussed directorial concept, and great orchestral sound.

However, there is much to admire, and it should be experienced.  But it could have been better.  I will give four stars because I am unable to add another half.",1338768000,14,1825,4.667711598746082
5043970,5,B006ZV6YUI,"Waltraud Meier delivers the greatest performance I've ever seen in an opera or even movie. Not only is she as compelling an actress as she usually is, but she's in her vocal prime (1992) and takes vocal risks with her performance that all pay off. Easily she's the best Kundry you'll ever see and hear. Even if you have the Baden Baden or the MET DVD with her, you should get this one to see her at her thrilling peak. I'm not prone to hyperbole, but I cannot praise her performance here enough. It's that good. Honestly, I showed parts of Act II to a total stranger on the street who doesn't know opera and they were riveted by Meier's performance.

Barenboim is no Knappertsbusch (for that true Parsifal sound, the 1962 Kna Bayreuth recording on Philips CD is the definitive Parsifal) but he's better than sluggish Levine at the Met and surface Nagano at Baden Baden.

I prefer Salminen's Gurnemanz for singing, but Tomlinson is close and a great actor to boot. And that's important as Gurnemanz has more lines than anyone else in the whole opera (in all of opera??).

Elming is a fine Parsifal (I slightly prefer Ventris) and the rest of the cast is equally good. Meier -- again -- is in a class by herself.

I like Lenhoff's production, but Kupfer is equally challenging, darker, and interesting and he gets a better job from the singers as actors. Both are bleak, futuristic productions, miles away from the Met's dull realistic production with those silly yellow flowers bouncing around in the third act.

So, all in all, this is THE Parsifal to get on DVD. I don't write many reviews here, but Meier's performance and this DVD absolutely deserve recognition.",1338508800,47,1665,4.649659863945578
5043971,5,B006ZV6YUI,"Oh wow - I waited so long for this production to be out on DVD that I almost forgot how how insanely great it is. I used to own it on VHS.

Meier is at her peak - enough said. Tomlinson actually makes you want the Gurnemanz monologues to go on longer, and Elming looks almost as good as he sings and acts.

For real hard core fans the Syberberg version may still be the top choice, but this one runs it a really close second.

It's a must have for anyone with even the slightest interest in this opera.",1337385600,23,502,4.0
8507279,4,B006ZV6YUI,"Excellent !!. Extraordinary repertoire and a coherent and pleasant staging to watch, something that contributes since this ""musical drama"", allows to live a serious mystical experience, and achieve a state of ""trance"", lucid, the ultimate purpose for which it was conceived undoubtedly. I removed a star for not having subtitles in Spanish.",1521158400,,340,5.5576923076923075
8507280,2,B006ZV6YUI,"This is a visually dreary production, the sets all stainless steel - hard, dark and cold - with characters emerging from a gigantic bank vault door or being floated in on what looks like an upside-down canoe. The action is fairly conventional (the story is left mostly intact, thank goodness), but there are odd moments, especially when the flower maidens are presented not as living beings but as images on computer monitors scattered about the stage: are we to glean from this that watching internet porn incapacitates young men like Parsifal for flesh-and-blood sex? There's no place for flowery meadows in Act 3 either, the only sign of nature redeemed being some projections of clouds on the reflective metal wall behind the characters. The final scene of the opera is anoher disturbing departure from Wagner, in that the healing of Amfortas fails and he dies while Kundry lives, and Parsifal, perhaps wondering why he even bothered retrieving the supposedly sacred spear, buries his face in his hands. It seems to be de rigeur in modern productions of Parsifal to mess up the ending and undercut the incomparable beauty of Wagners ecstatic music.

Others here have commented in detail on the singing and conducting. I found it mostly competent, but certainly not on a level with the best recordings. On the whole there were only a few moments when this production gave me the real Parsifal experience; This work can bring me to tears, but not this time.",1512172800,,1459,4.906882591093117
8507281,5,B006ZV6YUI,"To embark on Parsifal is to step on an ice floeit is a leap of faith that leaves you profoundly transformed. Parsifal is Wagners most ambitious and demanding worka gift of staggering difficulty and universal resonance.

A great work of art needs multiple engagements, yet this is the best version on DVD today. Daniel Barenboim as the conductor lets the diaphanous quality of the music to slowly undo your defences. The singers embody their characters with visceral conviction, none more than Waltraud Meier in her fearless commitment as Kundry. She and the others can do this because Harry Kupfer as the stage director dares to confront the depth of Parsifal. It is, crucially, Kupferss precise work with movement and gesture that conveys the elemental emotional struggles at the heart of Parsifal. The music is radically open and so is the staging: by leaving the questions unanswered, Kupfer lets us fathom the oceanic trenches of power and love for ourselves. Whether you are hesitantly considering your first Parsifal or have long wrestled with itfamiliar is not the word for a work that unsettlingyou need to experience this version.",1494115200,,1139,5.090909090909091
8507282,4,B006ZV6YUI,"Coming a bit late to review this DVD I have the unfair advantage of comparing it to the new Met Parsifal that came on to the market recently.
Although up until now Kupfer's production has been certainly one of the top videos, the Met simply outshines it in many respects.
Kupfer's Parsifal is a strong statement, tremendous visually with wonderful, monumental handling of architectural space, colour and especially the light. With shades of blue and white it's a never ending delight to watch and the entire post-apocalyptic concept is valid and well thought out.

The singers...... Waltraud Meier is probably the best, she is a veteran of the role of Kundry and her praises are well testified by other reviewers.
She perhaps could have looked and acted more seductive in the 2nd act: to me Parsifal had an easy job refusing her advances. John Tomlinson seemed too young, too aggressive and too dramatic for Gurnemanz. Elming's Parsifal is probably the best among the men,
but no comparison to Jonas Kaufmann from the Met. Falk Struckmann I always had trouble with. His voice seems out of focus at times and quite frankly him performing acrobatics jumping up to his 'canoe' and standing up on it he looked more like some muscleman, a balding Hercules rather than the weak, exhausted and immensely suffering Amfortas. In both of these roles the Met production was simply radiant.

Barenboim's conducting with slow tempi is a good achievement and he certainly had full control of the score, but Gatti who conducted the whole thing from memory had a great vision and was simply breathtaking. At the end we all stood in awe of the supreme effect he produced,
much like Toscanini did many years ago.
I was also unhappy with the balance of sound in this Berlin video. The engineering favored the singers and the orchestra seemed in the background whereas the Met video had superb sound.",1397865600,,1880,4.853582554517134
8507283,5,B006ZV6YUI,"1.  The cast are tremendous.  Waltraud Meier is stunning as Kundry.  John Tomlinson's Gurnemanz provides, as it must do, an excellent foundation and thread throughout the entire Opera.  Poul Elming is an excellent Parsifal especially in Act III.  Falk Struckmann's anguish as Amfortas is, well, anguished!
2.  Daniel Barenboim draws tremendous sound from the Staatskapelle.
3.  Although this is not a Blu-Ray the sound quality is excellent - better than most of my Blu-Rays.

This is thrilling and although I regard Barenboim as an excellent musician he surpasses my expectations in this performance.

Highly recommended.",1393804800,,621,5.4526315789473685
8507284,5,B006ZV6YUI,a great performance of a great work. Just love the third act and especially the Good Friday scene. A must for Wagner lovers,1391472000,,123,4.391304347826087

8507287,5,B006ZV6YUI,"Hardly a ""traditional"" performance of Wagner's masterpiece, this offers striking video images which will remain long in the viewer's memory. Be warned, you might prefer to listen rather than watch. LOL",1363219200,,201,5.516129032258065
8507288,5,B006ZV6YUI,"This video of Wagner's Parsifal, shot for Teldec in 1992 at the Berlin Staatsoper is notable for its strong, youthful cast of major Wagner singers and its stark production values. These come from director, Harry Kupfer, a proponent of the ""older"" school of regietheater, in that his ideas actually work. Mr. Kupfer transport the valued mystic objects (the Grail, the Spear) in a vast subterranean bank vault, a shifting puzzle box with moving walls and a huge vault door predominating the action.

Twenty years ago, this was one of the first ""concept"" Parsifals released on home video to break away from the standard image of knights in robes and helmets and flowery tarts frolicking around the opera's clueless hero. Happily, Mr. Kupfer's ideas hold up well. His claustrophobic setting is populated by weak, tottering Grail Knights that treat their daily worship as a narcotic fix. Amfortas (Falk Struckmann) is a haggard mess, with a very visible wound in his side. At the opera's end, he dies, and Kundry lives.

If you're acquainted with this opera, you know that nothing happens for the first half of Act I. Then Parsifal (Poul Elming) blunders into the vault. He is taken to a strange Grail ritual where Amfortas is placed on a sort of metaphorical spear point, and lifted high above the Knights to ""trigger"" the Grail's magic. Klingsor's realm (on the other side of the vault door) is a mirror image. His ""magic garden"" is a matrix of CRT screens, populated by vapid models in various stages of undress. At the end of Act II, Parsifal sets off a massive system crash.

The best performance here is Waltraud Meier, caught in her prime as Kundry. Ms. Meier manifests four different faces of this complex character, transiting from an asexual harridan in Act I to a smooth, Salome-like seductive mode in Act II.  and hits the big high notes at the end of Act II with clear, ringing tone. She is well-matched with Mr. Elming, whose clear, if slightly pinched tenor is caught before its rapid decline. She is most moving as the silent penitent in Act III, and her character's altered fate (she survives the opera) seems like a blessing and not a curse.

Gurnemanz (John Tomlinson) is young and bold, kept youthful by the magic of the Grail. Mr. Tomlinson sings the narration with an artless energy, not always pleasing in timbre but conveying the character's good nature and a kind of bluff bravado. Mr. Struckmann is an excellent Amfortas, combining an excruciating physical performance with rich, warm notes. Gunther von Kannen is completely evil, yet curiously noble as Klingsor.

Mr. Barenboim is an acclaimed Wagner conductor, caught here on the flip-side of his successful Bayreuth performances of The Ring. He draws clear, differentiated orchestral colors from the Berlin players, highlighting key phrases in the woodwinds and allowing the brass and strings to express the rich colors absent from Mr. Kupfer's visual palette. The Good Friday scene is magical, with a transcendent joy as you realize that these troubled characters have, at last reached journey's end. This makes the funeral march that follows even more terrifying: Wagner's version of the Dies Irae. The chorus (both the male Knights and offstage Flower Maidens) sing with beauty and meaning.

The longtime absence of this set from home video is probably due to legal issues in the transfer of the Teldec catalogue to its new label, EuroArts. Happily, the deep blacks and bright whites of the original laserdisc image come off cleanly on DVD, with rich tones of darkness set off by the stark lighting. The image never flickers or greys, although the audio recording occasionally overloads its own balance levels, causing unwelcome distortion at climactic moments in the first Act.",1360886400,5,3755,4.979266347687401
