7886069,3,6305247730,"Rather sympathetically depicting the SS sexy boys known for animal deeds both in eastern and some western parts of Europe, this British movie is surely of a general interest because of merely narrating historical facts a Nazi murdering machine was established.

There is something missed in this product much less grasping attention than ""Triumph of the Will"".",1261094400,,360,5.315789473684211
7886070,4,6305247730,"As a documentry this is above average. It is flawed because of the over use of often times unrelated STOCK FOOTAGE.  The narrative is very matter of fact, clear and cold. It appears to be well researched. One word of caution is this is one in a mini series of three hour long, I personal feel each is a little weak on thier own.

The documentry narrator has a very neutral tone. While interesting it allows the viewer to project his or her own bias on the subject.

""NO ONE CAN BE COMPLETLY NEUTRAL ON THE SUBJECT OF NAZISM!""

On the the subject itself I found no great errors in history.

One does need to remember that the Nazis created thier own links to history often deeply ""warped"". Reporting the ""warped history""

as such in context of this documentry is not to say the history is ""fact""!

On viewing this documentry I did find interesting the strong parrallels between the NAZISM of the past and the Al Qaeda of today.",1134604800,5,926,4.411764705882353
7886071,3,6305247730,"I believe the ppl who were responsible for putting this last DVD in the 3 part series ran out of matieral since they basically spend the most of it restating the Occult roots of Nazism thats in the first two DVDs.  Beyond that there is good info on the formation of the SS and its purpose to provide a stream of pure white aryan blood, but most of whats here u can find in a better source.",1058918400,7,389,4.0519480519480515
