1068827,4,6305754993,"These compilation DVD's, with two episodes each, normally have either mismatched episodes (to get a broader Trek experience) or episodes with a common theme (the crew heads off an ages-old computer that thinks it's alive or divine; the crew tries to save a feral planet in danger of repeating the mistakes of Earth's past), but this episode gets it right - offering two fine examples of the Enterprise's crew getting away from it all...whether they wanted to or not.
In ""Shore Leave"" the crew finds itself on an idyllic planet - perhaos one a bit too inviting.  Besides its beauty, the crew find themselves having to face their nightmares - anything that comes to mind also comes to life.  Whether it's a white rabbit late for a royal appointment, a samurai warrior, a tiger or some jerk who lorded it over you in your humbler years as a starfleet cadet - you'll find it here, or it will find you.
But it's the ""Squire of Gothos"" that steals the show - played by William Campbell (who would return as a Klingon in the ""Trouble with Tribbles"").  Trelane, the ""Squire"", has turned the otherwise lifeless world of Gothos into a base from which he celebrates life on Earth as he saw it (though interstellar chrono-distillation as theorized by Einstein has put him a few centuries behind the times).  Dissatisfied with the more orderly ways of the 23rd century, Trelane tries to absorb the crew into his more rogueish illusion.  This episode excelled because of the subtle nunaces of Trelane's character (superbly played by Campbell) that shows an all powerful being who is not all there.  Able to go from delightful to demonic in short bursts, Trelane becomes one of those one-shot characters that's more memorable than hosts of Klingons or Romulans.",1016928000,,1746,4.803333333333334

7894322,5,6305754993,"I bought this dvd for Squire of Gothos. I consider it a Q-episode becuse of the guest star. If Q is a miscief-maker, than Trelene is a sypathic bad guy. I like how Mr de Lancie updated his carcher in ST:TNG.",1386720000,,207,4.073170731707317
7894323,5,6305754993,there is a bit of whimsy in these two. a little of the day dreaming coming into reality sort of thing and for the other one a little of the mischief of a very overgrown child.,1373760000,,175,3.888888888888889
7894324,5,6305754993,"What a bargain this one is! If you talk to [original series] Trekkies, you'll find that they rave about these two episodes, the third great one being ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".

In ""Shore Leave,"" part of the Enterprise crew transports down for a little R&R on an interesting planet, only to discover that Lewis Carroll and others appear to have lined out the program. Each crew member experiences situations and people that existed earlier in their lives (or in their dreams). The ""Alice in Wonderland"" character theme continues throughout the episode. But Kirk quickly discovers that this seemingly joyful planet is NOT all in fun as death begins to plague his crew!

This entry is a really fun Star Trek romp, albeit it's serious at times, and is reminiscent of the much older ""Bonanza"" episode, ""Hoss and the Leprechauns"".

""The Squire of Gothos"" is truly a unique episode. 'The Squire' is brilliantly played by William Campbell, a renowned actor who was an original contender for the spot of Captain Kirk. This is the only episode where a chief character had more speaking parts than Captain Kirk (William Shatner). The ego-driven Shatner, only realizing this too late, never allowed THAT to EVER happen again!

I've known Bill Campbell, (""Love Me Tender,"" where he played Elvis Presley's brother in the latter's first film, an American Civil War saga), for many years and consider him a good friend -- this Star Trek episode was one of his favorite acting experiences of all time. He really loved this memorable and fascinating role as the ornery Squire, ""Trelane"". And I have to say, Bill was a perfect, very dramatic  casting choice for the difficult role.

The story: On the Planet of Gothos, Kirk, Spock, and female crew members  are forced to 'play' The Squire's games, WHEN he wants to play, and by HIS rules. It doesn't take long for The Squire to get under Kirk's skin, big-time, but he finds himself helpless against the vast power of this pseudo-Gothic troublemaker.

If you were only ever going to own a single original Star Trek Series DVD, this would be the one to grab!",1199836800,,2090,4.834733893557423
7894325,3,6305754993,"If you are picking which Vols to keep, give this one a miss; coming immediately after the brilliant Vol. 8, the two eps here are amusing but little else.  In ""Shore Leave"", we get a very realistic Holosuite with everyone's thoughts taking physical shape and with ""The Squire of Gothos"" we get the original Q-type alien.  As I have always hated Q, this ep is one of my least favourite and it also rings too close to a much better Twilight Zone episode where the characters are also playthings of some other creature without their knowledge.  Give this volume a miss.",1152403200,,565,4.574257425742574

7894328,4,6305754993,"REVIEWED ITEM: Star Trek Original Series DVD Volume 9: Shore Leave / The Squire of Gothos...
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: ""The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play"" -Captain Kirk
Historical Milestone: The first temporary death of a primary Star Trek cast member (Dr. McCoy)
Notable Gaffe / Special Defect: During one of the planet-bound scenes, a couple crewmates notice a WWII fighter plane up in the sky. The first few shots of the plane shows it to be a US Marines Corsair, the same plane the Black Sheep Squadron flew during the Pacific campaign. But when the plane dives to strafe the two officers, it magically changes into a Japanese Zero!
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember ('Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 1 temporarily dead (not McCoy)
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: If you're lookin' for a good hunk 'o' the kinda cheesiness that only a classic Trek eppie can provide, this is one of the better ones to check out. I especially enjoy the goofiness of Sulu being chased by a samurai whose swordsmanship and martial arts skills aren't even worthy of a clear belt! Kirk manages to beat a few of Star Trek's hackneyed gimmicks further into the ground when he ""meets up"" with an old flame, and gets his uniform top ripped up during his fight with an old nemesis from his academy days!
Also amusing is seeing McCoy killed by gettin' run through with a lance, then is brought back to life near the end to explain how the planet manufactures anything one can quite literally imagine! Which due to the show's limited budget would be as close as the viewer would ever get to seeing the process first-hand...
THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS PRELIMINARY BRIEFS:
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: The dangers of intellect without discipline and power without constructive purpose
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember ('Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: None
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: Probably more than any other classic Trek episode, The Squire of Gothos has been a major stumbling block towards rapprochement between the old-school Trekkies and their NextGen counterparts. Is the all-powerful Q of NextGen fame really a blatant ripoff of Trelane as the classic Trekkies claim, or merely an affectionate tribute to the squire as the NextGen crowd states? Not to be outdone, Shatner pulls out all the stops with his infamous staccato, halting dialogue (affectionately known as his ""Kirkian method acting"") during his back-and-forth verbal spars with the seemingly all-powerful pest. There's more overacting between these two than you'll ever see in any overachieving Shakespearean tragedy!",1032825600,,2674,5.206496519721577
7894329,5,6305754993,"Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 9 - Well, if you have read my past reviews (now over 200) you'll know I am a big, big fan of Star Trek and all its forms. This is another volume in the DVD series of original episodes. This one has two of my all time favorites.
Shore Leave: Is the story of an uncharted planet being explored for possible Shore Leave prospects. It is a special planet where all you have to do is imagine anything and this place whips it up and makes it come alive. Whether it was deadly or benevolent anything and everything is possible. Some great performances by William Shatner (Showtime, Miss Congeniality) and the Late Deforest Kelly (Waco, When Love Has Gone). Also a keen guest star shinning moment by Bruce Mars (Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, Mission Impossible) as Finnegan James T. Kirk old academy nemesis. It was written by Theodore Sturgeon ( Invaders, Land Of The Lost, The Twilight Zone) and directed by Robert Sparr (Batman, The Wild Wild West).
The Squire Of Gothos is a fun frolic of a kid being a spoiled brat. This is a role cleverly being played by William Campbell (Love Me Tender, Back Lash) (who also played the Klingon Commander in my all time favorite Original episode of The Trouble With Tribbles') who performance is brash, bold, theatrical and very over the top. This is where the ""Q"" Continuum must have patterned themselves after. He is funny and in the end a great big spoiled brat.
There are even shinning moments for dialogue and cleverness for Leonard Nimoy (Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Brave New World ) and George Takei (Mulan, Kissingger and Nixon ) as Spock and Sulu trying to match wits with the obnoxious Trelane! It turns out he is just a bad boy that just got carried away and in the end his parents remind him of what he is doing. Written by Paul Schnieder (Ben Casey, Eight Is Enough) and direct by Doug McDougall (Mission Impossible, Mannix) - this story is definitely clever and funny at times too!
This is a good volume to have in the original Star Trek series.",1032048000,2,2032,4.539509536784741
7894330,4,6305754993,"Star Trek Volume 9 has two important points. One being that McCoy character is developed even greater in SHORE LEAVE. The other point being the character of Trelane who would eventually evolve into the popular Q character on Star Trek TNG. Trelane was the blueprint for this standout character.
The first episode here is SHORE LEAVE which is quite entertaining but fairly bizarre and comical. The Crew lands down on an uncharted paradise like planet. However beneath this paradise is a amusmant park of bizarre illusions. Everything the crew thinks of appears out of nowhere moments later. Whether it's a giant rabbit, a samurai, a knight or Kirk's old rival Finnigan (a stereotypical Irish man who just happens to love to fight). The episode does however develope McCoys character quite well. He becomes far more likeable and not so tight fisted. The episode has a fairly mindless plot but it is one of the lighter Trek episodes that developes each character quite well.
The other episode here is THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS which is another bizarre and comical episode. Kirk and the crew are trapped but a peculiar humanoid who takes the form of an 18th century general. The humanoid dubbed himself as the lonely Squire Trelane (played by William Campbell). The character himself was a blueprint for the later Trek character Q. Campbell however plays the Squire so over the top that at times he is almost annoying. The episode is mildly enteratining but not an excellent Trek tale. Still it's great to see how silly the Squire is.
Overall Volume 9 displays the lighter side of the Star Trek series. Both episodes are watchable but extremely silly at moments. None the less its a nice additoon to the Trek DVD series. Highly recommended!",1025308800,,1731,4.871186440677966
