2384096,5,B000AAWF0I,"Brilliant, underated and mostly forgotten film that was beat out of the best picture Oscar by the film ""Cinema Paradisio"". Lush art direction, beautiful light and shadow photography, superb acting but more than any one element was the combination of music and romance. The film is special in all aspects, a true hidden gem from a small country that still appreciates the art of the story! A perfect 10 if you appreciate opera and love.",1128297600,19,435,4.8133333333333335
2384097,5,B000AAWF0I,"If you like opera, this DVD is a must have in your collection.  Jose Van Dam is a great singer.  It's interesting to see how singers are trainned to sing higher.  The movie is loaded with beautiful music from many opera.  The visual design is also superb.",1121990400,19,255,4.361702127659575

2384102,5,B000AAWF0I,"Interesting plot.  Fair acting.  Good music.  The scene of the aria ""sempre libera"" as a prelude to the duel was well achieved.  If you like opera this movie will catch you interest.  A successful opera singer decided to retire at the peak of his career, and announces it at his last public concert.  He accepts a pupil.  A young soprano.",1370649600,,338,4.533333333333333

2384104,4,B000AAWF0I,"If you do not like opera, do not get this film.  If you LIKE opera, get this film for the music.  There's arias and duets throughout the film.  There's also stories of love and revenge between the arias and duets, but the main reason to get this film is the music.",1349308800,,264,4.137254901960785
2384105,4,B000AAWF0I,"Great photography, great performers, great music. . .

The movie has a soap opera element that may or may not work for you. But what is most remarkable is the singing passages. You will never hear them again the same way, they will always have an extra resonance for you.",1344038400,4,271,4.42
2384106,5,B000AAWF0I,"Liza ""Duchess Darcy's"" review hits the nail on the head; scroll up and read it - she calls it exactly as it is. Beautifully filmed and sung. This is a cult classic because it achieves true film art.",1321660800,,198,4.2368421052631575
2384107,5,B000AAWF0I,"I think Anne Roussel is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, on screen or off. She doesn't sing, actually, but the dubbing and lip-syncing are so well done that I didn't even know that for several viewings. Yes, I have seen it many times, because in addition to Anne the scenery is also beautiful and the singing is sublime. The eponymous music teacher is played by the great Belgian baritone Jose Van Dam - his singing of Mahler's ""Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen"" is as good as it (that is, life) gets. The singing competition is pretty obvious, even silly, but it's a small price to pay for what is otherwise a musical gem. It does require a quiet place - there are no car chases and often little action at all - and a long attention span. It repays with interest.",1309910400,3,776,4.358620689655172
2384108,4,B000AAWF0I,"This film has attained cult status in some countries, among them my native Argentina. To see why, you just have to watch it. It is perhaps ``only"" a fairy tale, but one brimming with magic. The music and the visuals are gorgeous, and the film makes some very good points on the attainment of excellence. The great bass-baritone Jos Van Dam does a good job of movie acting as well and is supported by an excellent cast (especially Patrick Bauchau as Prince Scotti).

The DVD has been long out of print in this country. I obtained a Korean DVD (through Amazon.com) from an outfit called Brightdawn. Delivery was lightning fast. The DVD is of good quality, has the original sound track and subtitles either in English or Korean, and the price is in line with usual DVD prices. A very good buy.",1298592000,2,790,4.563380281690141
2384109,5,B000AAWF0I,"The Music Teacher is one of my favorite movies - music and songs are beautiful and also

2384110,4,B000AAWF0I,"I had seen this movie a number of years ago, and was glad to have found it on DVD.  One of the problems was that during the first half of the movie, the dialogue is not in sync with the actors. Then, suddenly the voices become aligned. It may have been a fluke during the transfer from video to this format. Nonetheless the music and costumes are top notch.",1268524800,,357,4.173913043478261

2384113,3,B000AAWF0I,"Great to get a DVD of this beautiful but hard-to-find movie.  It's in French, with subtitles in English and Korean.  The DVD is produced in Korea.  I've found a few issues:
1.  The Scene Selection does not work.  To get to a scene, you need to advance or back up scene by scene.
2.  The sound in places seems a little out of synch with the picture - not too annoying, bearing in mind that the dialog is in French and the songs are mostly in Italian or German.
3.  If you want to look at the synopsis, it's only in Korean.  My guess is that anyone who gets this DVD has already seen the movie.
Overall, I'm glad to have the DVD, but potential buyers might want to be prepared for the above sources of annoyance.",1245542400,10,710,4.131386861313868

2384117,5,B000AAWF0I,"Simply magnificent! I had watched this movie in VHS maybe 15 years ago and now that I am back studying music and singing in a Choir I decided to search for the DVD in order to show it to my peers. I was surprised to discover that it was not released in DVD here in Brazil. So... internet to the rescue!!! I found it thru Amazon and can't wait to see it again. This movie is definitely among the 5 best movies I have ever seen and let me tell you I am a maniac for movies and popcorn, so don't think twice, you will simply love it and that's guaranteed!!",1180656000,4,553,3.990990990990991

2384119,5,B000AAWF0I,"****** Contains Spoilers ******

A true gem of a film. The story of a famous opera singer who suddenly retires from the stage, much to the dismay of his fans and to the delight of his arch enemy. Joachim Dallayrac is at the top of his career when he announces his retirement and retreats to a country home. There he opens up a school but only has one student, a young soprano. He later comes across a young man, who has been caught stealing and also takes him as a student. When his arch enemy, Prince Scotti holds his annual singing contest and invites Dallayrac's students, it is an invitation they cannot refuse and are afraid to accept. Are Prince's Scotti's motives and intentions to destroy the pupils or help them jump start their careers?

The cinematography is breathtaking. The country home of Dallayrac seems almost enchanted, secluded in the countryside surrounded by trees, hills, and a scenic lake. The music is outstanding with arias from various operas sung with incredible emotion and sheer simplicity. The final singing duel between Dallayrac's student and Prince Scotti's protege showcases the differences between a true vocal gift and the appearance of one. As Dallayrac explains to his student Jean, years ago he won a singing duel against Prince Scotti not because Dallayrac thought he was the best singer, but because the Prince believed he was.

The rigours of training for singers is explored as the music teacher demands absolute concentration and sacrifice from his students. Sophie, the young soprano, laments about the loneliness she feels, but is told she must embrace that loneliness since it will be her companion for much of her life from now own. The sheer beauty of the music and scenery will captivate you into feeling, not just hearing the music. A sheer delight, this film will not disappoint.",1154304000,28,1831,4.9
2384120,5,B000AAWF0I,"As a special treat quite a few years ago (before DVD's) my husband spent a fortune purchasing a used copy of this on VHS for my b-day because he knew how much I loved it.

Right now I'm answering questions for an interview which asked me my favorite movie...as I always have I said ""The Music Teacher"" without hesitation.  I decided to peek at Amazon so I could see if it was out on DVD yet and was shocked and disappointed to see only two people have reviewed it.  5 stars from both of them of course, but how sad to think that many may not have seen this movie.

It is beautiful!  It is timeless!  The cd soundtrack is wonderful as well...I highly recommend it.

I hope everyone will buy it or at least rent it and see for yourself.",1147910400,13,734,4.163120567375887

There is already a much more eloquent review of this movie on Amazon's website.  To this I would add that the music direction, the acting,
Van Dam's brilliant and realistic portrayal of himself ( highest compliments !) along with the perfectly woven interplay of good vs evil keep this work of art number one in my movie favorites list.  It is a perfect story, beautifully and simply told.",1418515200,,526,4.402061855670103
8077417,4,B000AAWF0I,"I first saw ""The Music Teacher"" so many years ago when I rented it from a neighborhood movie rental store.  It was on VHS, and the story, cinematography, and musical score were phenomenal!  I saw this listed on Amazon in DVD format and knew that I had to order it.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.  The only drawback with this particular DVD is that the quality isn't as good as I had hoped.  I realize that the movie was copied from VHS to DVD, but the company that did it could have done a better job.  Even so, I love this movie so much (and it truly is hard to find in a store) that it was worth the purchase.",1413763200,,624,4.073770491803279

Shortly thereafter I learned that he is in fact a world-renowned opera singer, whereas the voices of the two young singers had been dubbed.
