8264738,3,B00171J16K,"In the best tradition of Latino-American stories, two males and female enjoy each other ages, from schoolhood, or.

More, probably, kind Gregorio, a self-mutilating schizophrenic, takes an upper hand being the Tanya's first and then got married her still fancying Manuel.

A story of lust, love triangle and dramatic end, where flashing male-hoods might attract some audience additionally.",1296864000,,389,5.689655172413793
8264739,3,B00171J16K,a good movie with a good cast of characters.  i enjoyed it but probably will only watch it once.  not a movie i would re-visit over and over.,1292544000,,141,4.0
8264740,1,B00171J16K,"The sex on the movie is great.  Not only is it erotic with both boys and girls baring all in their European hotness - I liked both - but the sex is the only element of the action, the plot, the movement of the characters that works.  The contrast of sexual expression as it varies from person to person and as it varies in one person with different partners and across time, that's the interesting thing.  This isn't reason enough to see the movie.

There's a comparison between the genuine mental illness of one character and the grief of another character when a friend dies.  That's offensive and just plain wrong.  Mental illness is a different thing, a true variation in organization of the brain that causes terrible problems for the person who has it and unfortunately for his or her family and friends.  Being a loser who gets really upset when his friend dies is a totally different thing.  I found myself responding to the psychotic character a great deal, probably more than the average viewer, because of my firsthand experience.

The movie is just all bad.  There's not enough exploration of motivations and backgrounds of some of the characters because screen time is taken up by pensive silence that would be filled with emotion if the lead man and woman could act.  She's snively and dumb.  He's stoic and dumb.  Blech.",1275782400,,1335,4.6781115879828326
8264741,1,B00171J16K,"I just have to agree with the majority of the reviews here: One of the worst movies I have watched.  I thought that all of the other films I have seen that were based on Arriaga's screenplays--Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Babel, The Burning Plain--were very good, some excellent, and all genuinely thought provoking, so I was really looking forward to this one.  No such luck.  As others observed, there was too much sex and it was pointless.  The story was threadbare--whether Arriaga's own screenplay or the inadequate realization by the director is to blame, I have no idea--but, what was most maddening, there were enough little elements promising more than was delivered to make this film especially disappointing.

Unless you are writing a thesis on Arriaga and are obligated to see everything that has his signature, don't waste your time on this one.",1269648000,2,891,4.993243243243243
8264742,1,B00171J16K,"I just finished reading this book and it is a TERRIBLE book. I bought it for $1 and read the back, thinking it would be somewhat good and it was a complete waste of my time. I don't understand how this book was even published. And a DVD too? If you want a stupid pointless book/movie full of sex and nudity, look no further.",1243468800,,324,4.078125
8264743,5,B00171J16K,"If you are looking for soft porn, and very little dialogue than this is the movie for you. Great bodies, and some kind of actions if that works for you. For those that actually look for a complex or some what of a complex... or better yet and type of story line... than this is not for you.",1230595200,10,290,4.017241379310345
8264744,1,B00171J16K,"This movie is bad. Let me explain why:
First of all, the DVD box says it has Dolby Digital 5.1, but it sounds as if it were Dolby Surround, I mean you'll only get sound from the 3 front speakers, nothing will come from rear in this movie.
There's no conflict in this story, the main character is not forced to make decisions, to sacrifice something to achieve his goals, he doesn't even have a goal, he doesn't develop, he isn't confronted with somebody or something, he just spend the whole movie having sex with every girl that appears. The story takes you nowhere.
There are a lot of uncomfortable silences between the characters and the dialogs are very stereotyped. Don't waste your money and time watching this one.",1221609600,,721,4.596899224806202
