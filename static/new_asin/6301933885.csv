380962,5,6301933885,Good movie.,1473465600,,11,5.0
380963,3,6301933885,"Another coming of age story. Two problems: too much ""artsy"" content that doesn't really lend itself to the story, but takes up an inordinate amount of the movie. For instance, the scene where he's walking down the country road goes on WAY too long. Unfortunately, there's more than a few of these scenes.
The other is the abrupt ending that left me quite unsatisfied. Perhaps for a film festival these two things make for a good festival film, but I wasn't looking for an artsy movie but for something entertaining. Guess I'm just too unenlightened to ""get it.""
Would have only given it 2.5 stars. Not saying don't watch it, just saying realize ahead of time that most folks who watch it will get to the end of it and not be entirely satisfied.",1472428800,,744,4.559701492537314

381039,1,6301933885,"Wow!  This was just awful. I'm a huge fan of indie movies, but I could not get into this at all. I know lots of quirky people, but these characters I just wanted to smack.  Sorry that I wasted my time.",1453593600,,201,3.8780487804878048

381041,5,6301933885,"It's a charming film.  I am not sure when this film was made, but it is a very-early 80s feel, and I recall the very tail-end of this kind of innocence and a kinder ""gay community"" when we were nicer to one another - i guess in part because we had to be.  It gets the family angle right.  Lots of people at that time had positive, but compromised, family relationships.  By that I mean we played don't ask/don't tell without knowing that was the name of the game, but it wasn't the end of the world at that time.  It also got right how some had had early experiences, and some didn't.  And some people, like the characters in the film, made happy endings for themselves -- not megahappy, but happy.  It was nice to see this film, like its characters, and think about a lot of stuff. It's a good chilly, rainy night movie to watch by yourself.",1451088000,,842,4.225

381045,2,6301933885,Good movie with the style of home-made movies in 1989. Tells a story of a young man coming to NYC and his first week in the city. A kind of sefie in the age before the cell phones.,1427155200,,180,3.763157894736842
381108,1,6301933885,"A very low budget, simple, cliche tale of the rural young gay man moving to the big city to ""find himself"". Very cliche and riddled with stereotypes of rural people as naive, ignorant, ""country bumpkin"". The story went incredibly slowly and by the end of the film, there was no resolution. In sum, this film had no plot and no substance. The only thing I enjoyed was seeing New York City in the 1980's with glimpses of the elevated railway that is now the High Line, the west side highway, the (once) gritty-ness of NYC, and the Twin Towers. What a huge disappointment.",1426377600,,569,4.533980582524272

381110,1,6301933885,"I got the point that the protagonist left home to find himself in the big city, but the dialogue didn't tell a complete story for me. The film was also complicated by scenic footage that was too long in length. There was a graphic sex scene in the beginning that concluded with the lead crying and in the end you are given the weakest of reasons why after you've moved on from caring.",1420502400,,384,4.273972602739726
381111,5,6301933885,"Yes, the movie is amateurish in film quality and camera angles (they never change!). But the characters are quite wonderful. The friendliness of the milieu depicted is totally refreshing.

Was the gay world in NYC ever so charming and welcoming? (It would be nice to think so.)

I found the acting, while uneven, quite convincing and, despite other opinions expressed here, I think the central character is cute as a button!",1420243200,,424,4.957746478873239
381112,4,6301933885,An interesting script and a nice visit with the characters.  Enjoyed the movie.,1419897600,,79,5.076923076923077

381115,3,6301933885,"I have to admit, as DEEPLY flawed as it is, from ultra-low budget poor production values, including sound, lighting, editing, music & mediocre, at best, acting...there is something really interesting about this movie. I wouldn't watch it again, but I finished it, only fast forwarding a tiny bit.  It appears to have been made in the late 80s with someone's home camera. Our lead Buddy, a naive country boy living with his lower middle class family moves to NYC to experience life in the city (and come out of the closet). With little money and (an exaggerated) naivete, he manages to get by and kick start his gay life through quick acquaintances and people's attraction to him. (His sweet character more than his looks) The movie gives us the first week, the catalyst of his life to ... ?  The film just ends, but we can easily imagine where things are going. The film is less about the narrative and more a sort of an expose, almost a hidden camera peek at this moment in the life of Buddy. The New York City scenes seemed covertly shot in what were at the time obscure locales. It also makes for an interesting time capsule of the NYC of the late 80s, decay and all, before the Giuliani redux. There's a scene on what appears to be the High Line, before the High Line park concept, that was kind of cool to see. I watched it free with Prime and have no regrets though this would not be for everyone, only those who would enjoy fringe low budget independent film with little narrative buried deeply in subtext. If I knew then what I know now, I'm not sure I'd pay to see it. Uptick to three stars for being sheer train-wreck interesting. Down tick for being a plain awful production, low budget even considered.",1417392000,,1714,4.490384615384615

381117,3,6301933885,I thought it was a good attempt to portray an ordinary guy coming to terms with urban life and beat. The movie is low key mainstream. The hero is a country kid. He is not drawn to the usual gay movie pleasures. He is open and plain in his taste. He is refreshing in his confident wonderment  and easily amazed but unashamed to be basic. He is a no frills gay.,1413244800,,359,4.056338028169014
381148,4,6301933885,I would recommend this movie to mast of my buddies. I did not like the way it ended.,1412380800,,84,3.7222222222222223

381153,1,6301933885,Admittedly I only watched the first 20 minutes. The sound quality had issues like hearing the wind blow on the mike and other background noise. I did not appreciate the characters; the main guy was brooding and boring.,1405900800,,218,4.7631578947368425

381209,1,6301933885,Boring!  Didn't even finish it.  The plot was weak and the storytelling awful.  Most of the film was just drawn out scenes that didn't add anything to the movie.,1400025600,,161,4.482758620689655

I just can't figure out what that genre is.  If Gomer Pyle was gay (oh, he is gay), with a lobotomy, he would have been a comparable lead.  This film captures something that I cannot describe; perhaps the joy of mutual masturbation.  Mary Poppins, move over.

Weird, quirky, jerky and strange but definitely a flick that must be seen to be believed.  Destined to become a cult classic.

That would be the cult of the nerds.",1389312000,,574,4.339622641509434

I fast forwarded a couple of times trying to see if it got better.  It didn't in my opinion so I eventually gave up.  I probably watched about 20 minutes total.,1366243200,,306,3.9672131147540983

The characters didn't get fleshed out enough to make all that much sense.  And the relationship scenes didn't go anywhere.  I suppose for the 80s this was fitting in how the characters interacted.

What really disappoints me, and I don't know if this is Amazon's doing or the company releasing this digital version, is this version of the film is CENSORED. First off, this video is labeled 'unrated,' which means viewers expect there to be some incidental nudity, language, drug use or whatever.

When I am buying a film, I don't expect there to be a huge black square in the middle of the screen, shielding my eyes from something I know is supposed to be there, something I expect to be there, because I saw it in the original version, which was also marked 'unrated.'

Like I said, the film is enjoyable and it was certainly not expensive. However, when I pay retail for a film (rather than renting it), I don't expect the version I buy to be different from the version that is available on DVD. If this digital release hadn't been under $10, I would be returning it.

Since this may or may not be a studio issue, I did not rate this film based on the censorship, but none of the other reviews pointed out it was a cut up copy, so that's the topic I chose to comment upon.",1353024000,,1299,4.289795918367347

Apparently the director thought that every single frame he shot should end up in his film. There are seemingly endless scenes that go on and on and on for no particular reason. There are scenes with no dialogue and no music, not even background noises! This movie is much too boring to be 'so bad it's good'.

The full frontal nudity was boring and does not redeem the movie. The actor wasn't that good looking and the scene, like the rest of the movie, wasn't interesting to watch.

This movie is so amateurish it's hard to believe it was originally released in 1989. If Amazon allowed negative stars, this movie might rate a negative 5 stars.

There are long, long takes that may try your patience, except that they set a very individual tone and style.  Essentially the story of a shy, but spirited, small-town guy who decides all of a sudden to head for some ""Fun Down There"" in Manhattan, where he aimlessly rambles through his little journey of self-fulfillment with gay sex and love.  (The film is unrated due to some semi-explicit masturbatory sex.)  The film's humor is almost totally deadpan, and the brainless conversations between Buddy (Michael Waite) and his family are borderline hilarious.  (Buddy's parent's are played by Waite's real-life Mom & Dad.)  A real homemade project, from the days when ""independent"" meant something.  Maybe not for everyone, but worth a look for those interested in the evolution of gay subject matter in films.

381451,3,6301933885,"When ""Fun Down There"" came out, so to speak, in 1988, it was hardly your conventional gay movie. It wasn't glib, it wasn't full of histrionics or loaded with messages or trying to shock, in short it was rather unlike the way gay people are portrayed - mostly by themselves - in most media. The film quality and sound were mediocre at best, but I rather liked the film. The story of a very real and ordinary young man (in both looks and aspirations) from upstate New York coming to the city and making a life for himself despite being rather baffled by the whole gay scene, was very understated and rather charming. It may be a bit too boring and lacking in drama for some - if you want to see a movie with a lot more drama and intensity but with a gay character who is similarly realistic and outside what most think of as gay culture, check out Gus Van Sant's first movie, ""Mala Noche,"" which is a gritty, funny and disturbing film full of a bittersweet sadness and longing.",995328000,,975,4.333333333333333

7817124,1,6301933885,"Oh my GOD  WTF,  This is the worst low budget movie I've ever seen. The acting was the bad, the storyline sucks and that's not in a good way. I watched this movie in 15min by fast-forwarding through the entire movie. All I want to know is how the hell did this make it to Amazon? A total waste of bandwidth!",1515888000,,307,4.016393442622951
7817125,1,6301933885,"Automatically it looks as the director was trying to reach a timeline of 98 or 99 minutes by showing the public a very long and BORING walk down the road with the lead character. The story line is terribly dull. The viewer really does not connect with the characters because they seem uncomfortable in their own skin. If this was supposed to be an art house film it passed in complete boredom, but failed as any true form of art. Suggestion: Any other film then this!",1513900800,,467,4.441860465116279

sung...start @ 27:05. This song was written by the great French singer Edith Piaf. Listen to her sing it on You Tube.
She is one of the most amazing singers of all time.
If you enjoy gay films, there is nothing wrong about this movie. It is just a low budget movie with good intentions.",1502668800,,398,4.115384615384615

Strange, long scenes which I cannot figure out what the director wanted me to feel other than boredom.  The characters all seemed plastic and the acting made the plastic melt.  There wasn't one scene or one actor that I cared about.  Save yourself some time and don't bother with this bad movie.",1500422400,,397,4.383561643835616
