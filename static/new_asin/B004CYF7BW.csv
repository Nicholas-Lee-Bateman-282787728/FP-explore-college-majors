4329892,4,B004CYF7BW,"I have been a huge fan of Y & R for many years, watching while in the military, as a student, and as a published author, I look to the storytelling of the late William J. Bell and co-creator Lee Phillip Bell when it took years to resolve a story. Although I would have enjoyed some clips to enhance the 35th anniversary, just seeing the cast joke and banter and discuss this dwindling medium was cool. A boon to my collection.",1310083200,7,426,4.271604938271605
4329893,4,B004CYF7BW,"This panel discussion is a fun look at Y&R. While I would have preferred a different mix on the panel, it was a witty as well as informative exchange. This was my first ever VoD purchase and went off without a hitch.",1298764800,5,216,4.166666666666667

4329897,4,B004CYF7BW,There were only about 9 cast members that were a part of the Anniversary.  It would have been great to see and hear from more cast members.  Otherwise it was great!,1367971200,,164,4.258064516129032
4329898,5,B004CYF7BW,"I really enjoyed this.  I have watched ""The Young & the Restless"" since its beginning and it means alot to listen to the people who play the parts.  Funny how they all begin to sound and seem like a family to you after so many years.",1366934400,,233,4.043478260869565

4329902,4,B004CYF7BW,"Having watched Y&R myself for thirty-some years, this was a delightful program to see. I loved how the actors talked and joked about their own characters, almost as though it was personal. As she always does, Jeanne Cooper stole the show!

(The only bad parts were when they let the audience ask questions. The worst was when a ventriloquist woman in the audience used a little girl as a puppet to say she ""watches the show every day"" in a very creepy voice. Peter Bergman seemed to play along with the woman, but mentioned that he remembered her from some other ""mothers dressing up little girls"" type of convention.)",1354320000,,618,4.669724770642202
4329903,5,B004CYF7BW,"In 2008 CBS television and the Paley Center for TV celebrated the remarkable milestone of the 35th Anniversary of daytime's #1 rated show ""The Young and the Restless"". Having been at the top of the U.S. Nielsen Ratings list since the middle of 1988 (24 years!!!) is something no other television show has ever done. For every single week no other serial has ever surpassed this remarkable achievement so it's with great fanfare the stars of the series took time to be on a panel to discuss the ups and downs in Genoa City. Among the stars are Jeanne Cooper (the longest-lasting member of the cast since late 1973, Jess Walton, Melody Thomas-Scott, Joshua Murrow, Peter Bergman and Michelle Stafford, most of whom are all Emmy winners.

 The cast also takes questions from the audience at the end.

 This is a gem to own if your a fan of this fantastic serial.",1325635200,6,859,4.631578947368421

This show never grabbed me the music is too slow and the storylines never seemed exciting just dull... however, with that said this is wonderful! I loved the interviews and it may even get me to watch this show with different set of eyes. I only wish Days of our lives had a few on amazon now and I would be happy",1393372800,,393,3.925
8423765,5,B004CYF7BW,"This program was filmed in 2008, but I just found it now, in 2014.  I liked to see the cast from a few years ago.  I have been watching Y&R for so many years, but it turns out that the mid-2000s were a few years I didn't catch many episodes.  So, I was interested in some of the storylines the actors were talking about.  Toward the end, the moderator takes a few questions from the audience.",1389830400,,392,4.118421052631579
