3092076,3,B0012LL5RI,"Got this DVD set for my 6-year-old, train crazy grandson. He has others like it and loves to watch and learn about trains. I expect that it will get much play-time as he grows.",1315353600,,176,4.205882352941177
3092077,5,B0012LL5RI,"My 2 1/2 year old son is a train fanatic.  I probably should buy a second copy, as he's worn this one out!",1262995200,,106,3.608695652173913
3092078,5,B0012LL5RI,"My 2 year old grandson calls this DVD ""Choo-choo Snow!""  He seems to grasp the concept of snow even though he has never seen it.  He absolutely loves watching the train plow through the huge pile of snow.  It happens at the beginning of the DVD and he will stop and start it over and over.  I really need to show him how to rewind.  The first time I put this DVD in for him, he sat transfixed for almost the entire show.  Whenever the train whistle would blow, you'd hear a little voice going, ""woo woo"".  The adults watching with him were enlightened about how to put a train that jumped the tracks back on.  We had no idea it was done like that (I won't spoil the surprise!).  I think any child with an interest in trains will enjoy this DVD.  My grandson hasn't watched Thomas since getting this and a couple of others.  I think he prefers real trains over cartoon.",1250640000,,868,4.2317073170731705
3092079,5,B0012LL5RI,"My four year old grandson is HEAVILY interested in trains.  When I seen these DVD's advertised, I knew I had to purchase them for him for his birthday.  He thoroughly enjoys watching both DVD's (1 & 2).  These videos hold his interest from the time the video starts till the end.  The narrator (in the video) also is very good at describing information that even a four year old can understand.  I would recommend these videos to anyone... child, grandchild or even an adult who has an interest in trains,
Thank You,

3092080,5,B0012LL5RI,"I received the movie on time, the video is exactly how it was described. Action shots of lots of different trains, with lots of train sounds. Any young child into trains will love this video.",1238976000,,191,4.485714285714286
3092081,3,B0012LL5RI,"This DVD does have some interesting videos of trains, but I won't buy the other ones in this series.
The good: interesting video shots of trains crossing bridges, and lots of different kinds of American railroad trains.  I liked the cover shot of the CEFX No 3131 SD40 locomotive slowly pushing through some snow, and a few other shots pretty well.
The not so good: many of the sequences are too short (a few seconds) for a very young viewer to enjoy or concentrate on, in my opinion.  My son asks me what is that train doing, and before I can answer, the video cuts over to another completely unrelated train.

The voice of the narrator has a good spirit to him, but he could have a slightly better script.  The script introduces some important concepts, such as the history of American railroad lines, and the consolidation of them in the late Twentieth Century, including some details, but there is not enough follow-through.  This DVD could have been expanded into three DVDs:  one on American freight trains and equipment doing work such as switching cars or making up trains in yards, and one on passenger trains and equipment (including history), and one on American railroad lines and their history of consolidation and the kinds of trains they run.  All of these topics are introduced, but never really completed, in the one DVD.

So, if this is just for little kid filler TV-sitter entertainment, and not for serious introduction to the trains and history being presented, then it's not disappointing.  But my son and I would have enjoyed learning more than we did from watching this video.

I didn't expect this to be a serious documentary, but it could have been so much better with just a little less attention paid to video scene transition effects and more attention paid to telling us what we are watching, with many more examples of trains moving slower, or longer takes on each train presented.  The video of the CSX on 7th street in Hudson NY is great, but the script editors could have impressed me if it told us a bit more than simply showing the novelty of a railroad on a city street.
I only needed to google ""Iron Horse Bar"" and CSX to find out where it was, but why make me do that?

If the DVD were less expensive, or if we didn't like train videos so much, I wouldn't have cared or been as disappointed.",1236038400,17,2330,4.574519230769231
3092082,5,B0012LL5RI,"For train newbies, this is an awesome addition of train dvds, the narrator (good speaker, not boring or dull) is the same in part 1 of this dvd series, but there are more details, like putting the tracks together, or how they get all those automobiles in the car carrying part of the train!

8246732,4,B0012LL5RI,"We saw this video playing at the local train museum. I considered it a little pricey for a kids video, but I bought it anyways. It has video of different type of real trains and gives quite a bit of detail info about the trains. But, they are not constantly talking which is nice. Lots of train video without any one talking and just train sounds between the narration. My 4 year old son is very happy with the video. My son likes trains but is more into construction vehicles, but he still really enjoys this video. For a kid that loves trains and likes to learn facts this would be a great video. I would say we have watched it enough already to justify the price.",1421280000,,666,4.251968503937008

He really enjoys the movies and I have 2 more grandsons coming up under him to pass them along to.  Hopefully they all will enjoy the train movies and the collection of trains that we have.  Lots of fun for the whole family.,1390780800,,344,4.412698412698413
8246735,5,B0012LL5RI,"There is something to be said for simplicity. This DVD does not have a lot of the flash and flare as others on the market which also means it does not have a lot of the unnecessary filler. It conveys the true feelings of a Fathers interest in a Childs love with amazing footage of these mechanical wonders that our Sons and Daughters seem so consumed by.

Wonderful video would highly recommend.
