8328631,5,B001O0TM9U,"My young son was/is a HUGE Thomas the Tank Engine fan. As he was growing up I purchased many of these VHS Tapes and later DVDs for him to watch. It was my observation that he enjoyed hearing Ringo Star's voice as the narrator above all the others, and so, many videos were watched more repeatedly than others.

They are all fun to watch, with beautiful scenic backgrounds, and beautiful model trains. The voices and scenarios are both fun and educational, and every episode comes with a lesson to be learned in it. This particular video also came with a toy train that fit his collection, and could be used on the same wooden tracks.

While my son is older now - seven and no longer two or three (the pinnacle of his Thomas days), I still get nostalgic seeing these, and will occasionally put one into the DVD player when no one else is around. Great fun for kids and parents alike.",1327968000,,882,4.404907975460123
