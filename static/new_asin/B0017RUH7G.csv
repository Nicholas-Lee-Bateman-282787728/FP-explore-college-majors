I watched Murder She Wrote the other night, and this movie was a plot of one of the shows.  I looked on Amazon and was delighted to see that this was indeed an actual movie, but I was very disappointed to see that it not available at this time.  Please re-release this on dvd for those of us that wish to purchase it.  Thank you.",1453939200,3,504,4.05050505050505
8267024,5,B0017RUH7G,"Being a fan of the TV series Murder, She Wrote, and having already seen this older black & white classic movie, Strange Bargain, I was astonished to discover that not only the plot but the original stars of the movie have continued in an episode of Murdge, She Wrote (Season 4 titles, ""The Days Dwindle Down"").  In the movie, Jeffrey Lynn's character did not go to prison for killing his boss, but in the Murder, She Wrote episode, his character has just been released from serving a 30 year sentence for the crime.  The color TV episode includes many black & white flashback scenes from the movie.  Actors Jeffrey Lynn, Martha Scott and Henry Morgan reprise their original roles and TV character Jessica Fletcher solves the case.  A little different twist from the movie ending, but a joy to watch which is a credit to the excellent writing on Murder, She Wrote.",1375574400,8,863,4.657894736842105
8267025,4,B0017RUH7G,"This is a review for the DVD release of STRANGE BARGAIN, an RKO film that
was originally released in 1949.

STRANGE BARGAIN concerns an assistant book keeper named Sam wilson, played by Jeffrey Lynn,  who, while trying to get a raise after 12 years, finds out that not only is he out of a job, the company is going under as well. And the wealthy boss, Malcom Jarvis, played by Richard Gaine, is as broke as the company and has only one asset, an unusually large life insurance policy which he enlarged a few months before.

The assistant book keeper and the boss have a well earned respect for each other and the boss decides to confide to the asst book keeper, Sam wilson,  that he is planning to commit suicide at a fixed time this Saturday night when no one else wil be home. He wants the employee to take a ten thousand dollar payment  for coming over to the boss's house after the deed is done and make sure everything looks like a murder/robbery was committed. If the scheme works the boss's family will get the insurance money and will be taken care of for many years to come.

So come Saturday night Sam Wilson sits uncomfortably in his home, everyone else in his family is preoccupied with other activities, wondering if he should drive over to the boss's place.  Finally, he gets into his car and motors over. Sam finds the body, does what he can to make it look like a murder scene and goes home.

The police, headed by a very sharp investigator well played by Harry Morgan, find any number of discrepencies and so virtually everyone who knew the boss is a suspect on some level.

In the meantime Sam Wilson, still with the envelope containg the $10,000 the boss gave him, is struggling with himself to keep his mouth shut only he vaguely seems to realize that a noose is framing his neck ever tighter as time goes by.

STRANGE BARGAIN is quite a fast paced noirish little thriller with excellent performances by Jeffery Lynn,
Martha Scott as his wife and Harry Morgan as the cane wielding police detective.  Things wrap up fairly
rapidly towards the end so a viewer is advised to stay alert or this one could zip right past you.

Many years later a heavily edited version of STRANGE BARGAIN was used as the basis for an episode of the long running TV series, ""Murder She Wrote.""

I give STRANGE BARGAIN four stars.",1281830400,5,2326,4.470449172576832
