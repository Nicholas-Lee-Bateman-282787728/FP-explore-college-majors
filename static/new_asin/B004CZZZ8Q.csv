8424501,4,B004CZZZ8Q,"Two solidly entertaining older films from WB & First National Pictures. Each is just over an hour in length, so you needn't worry about being stuck in front of the TV all day to finish one (or both) of them, but that also means you won't see a lot of character development nor backstory. These films are fact-paced, efficiently assembled and IMHO, well worth your time. Another positive is that both are easily recommended for the whole family, as movies from this time period didn't contain any course language, gratuitous violence or nudity. Whether younger viewers will sit still through these 80+ year old B&W dramas is another story entirely! LOL.

Both of these flicks are fun, but ROAD GANG is my favorite of the two. It tells of a wrongly accused young reporter, whose idealistic ways threaten to get him and his young friend killed at the manipulating hands of corrupt politicians. The chain gang prison system our hero winds up in is utterly vile and thoroughly corrupt from top to bottom. Will he & his pal escape?? Good stuff! DRAEGERMAN COURAGE concerns its plot with a greedy mine owner who takes dangerous shortcuts to speed up his operation in order to increase profits. These safety cheats inevitably lead to hazardous conditions and cause cave-ins, trapping handfuls of hard-working men deep underground. The mine shafts are soon running low on oxygen and filling up with water. Can the miners be reached before it's too late??? Depression-era movie tough guy Barton Maclane plays a dedicated rescue worker (draegerman) who risks his life to dig the entombed men out. This, too, is another engrossing film that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Both prints looks pretty impressive seeing as how neither received any restorative work and the disc is one of those DVD-r burned on demand jobs. Solid blacks & mid-tones, with only minor print damage and no splices or jumpcuts. Strong mono soundtrack on both. Sadly, as with 99% of all W-B Archive stuff there are no bonus features, not even a trailer (and no closed captioning either, in case you're wondering). Of interest is the curious fact that ROAD GANG's lead villain must have had a real-life counterpart that the film makers worried about getting into legal hot water over.  The character's name in the film is Mettcalf, but every time it's spoken on screen the second syllable of his name gets clipped off. Also, all insert shots of newspaper headlines, telegrams, notes, etc. for the film were replaced with new ones, so that the badguy's name is ""Moett"" and thus pronounced ""Mett"" on screen. Very, very odd. It would be interesting to learn the story behind those alterations. I enjoyed both of these low budget quickies. So... 4 STARS for these two programmer adventure flicks.",1419811200,,2751,4.911827956989248
