7912728,4,B00000JLV8,"This group of videos made by the space shuttle  crews and put together with a nice sound track  put the book ""Orbit"" (National Geographic) into  weightless beautiful motion. The videos are not the  finest of quality, but once into the first 30 seconds, one wouldn't care as  the incredible  detail displayed before your eyes is absolutely  breathtaking. One would tend to view the video not once but twice to see  more detail.  Nasa has some fine photographers and editors!",943315200,,473,4.886075949367089
