8231849,5,B000YDAJQS,"Orson Welles had to have been one of the finest actors alive to play the role of a movie villain.  He was one of the greatest actors of his time. This character he plays way back in the 1970's is certainly one of his better dark portrayals.

 This movie is indeed very bizarre, still to this day in 2017, & it has been quite a lost gem over time. Basic plot: Young woman had a miscarrage, and both she and her husband find themselves in the company of what turns out to be a bizarre group of twenty and thirty somethings who form a weird witch like cult led by an even more macabe and strange but highly intelligent much older man in one Orson Welles.  They soon realize at first these folks are both a neo-pagan counter culture group, and a sex cult who follow their own bizarre religion similar to that of real life whacko Englishman mystic Allister Crowley. This group is totally weird, but also it appears they are benign at first.

 But then the girl has mysterious dreams, nightmares, and ghoulish encounters until finally she discovers the weird frightening truth. I had generally really very much enjoyed this movie, and found Welles's performance so astonishing as this villain I would place him up there acting wise with other amazing past movie-tv show villain actors such as James Earl Jones's ""Darth Vader"" & ""Thulsa Doom"", Heath Ledger & Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"", Ricardo Montoban's ""Khan"", Robert England's ""Freddy Krueger"", Ian McDermand's ""Palpatine"", or Gary Oldman's ""Dracula"".  This late man's performance in this very dated old film had really stuck out for me, it is that good even if the rest of the film isn't a masterpiece.

  The movie does have some sexual scenery, a few adult themes, a lot of nudity, and some very powerful frightening horror imagery with some mild violence but not once did this film ever cross the line into any gory or sadistic bloodletting to the R rated level of past movies such as ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" so for me, unlike other folks who would be offended by anything, the PG rating was correct. Back in the 70's adults had rated movies, & Hollywood had no problem making both kid films and adult films unlike today where most movies are super hero CGI fests aimed only at teenagers. The film is not for very young kids but I say it would be a fun horror witch themed adventure thriller for older kids from 10 up along with teens and adults.

 If you enjoyed other horror thrillers which were not total monster or slasher fest films, but had good satanic and demonic imagery similar to vampire or warlock movies you might really enjoy this one like I did.  A- for ""Necromancy: The Witching"".",1490659200,,2662,4.626326963906582
8231850,4,B000YDAJQS,"I first saw this obscure film as a young teenage, I was up before 5 am for some reason and was flipping through channels when I stumbled across this movie - the weird part - it was not in the listing or on the cable guide. The early shot of the funeral with name ""Timothy"" on the tombstone was especially chilling as I share that name. While the acting is perhaps lacking in some scenes, the presentation is very ""Psychedelic Horror"" minus the sleaze, with surprisingly good use of early film special affects. The story is somewhat loose and perhaps this is only because the film appears like a ""how to"" manual on black magic specifically the revival of the dead. A remake of this might be great opportunity for better effects, however for the early 70s horror genre - the film stands out as an Orsen Wells  creation",1486598400,3,816,4.476510067114094
8231851,3,B000YDAJQS,"From 1970.  A good 'bad' film from that experimental decade in movie making.. That said, seeing just about anything with Orson Welles is always worth it.  Even if for just a laugh and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments here. Necromancy is the perfect ""Ground Hog Day"" type of film best enjoyed late at night as most grade  Z movies require.  Orson is a warlock who lures a young couple to his town of Lilith to raise his young son from the dead.  A trippy psychedelic dive into the unknown.  The end has a neat twist that makes the film surprisingly enjoyable.",1486166400,,567,4.403846153846154
