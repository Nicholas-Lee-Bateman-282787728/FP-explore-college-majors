8252988,3,B0013U4RSC,"This was my fault. The DVD I ordered can't be played in my area. So I sent it back and asked for one that could be played here, or another series. Series 7-8 to be exact. Thanks for your help. I haven't heard back",1495411200,,213,3.8636363636363638

8252992,5,B0013U4RSC,"Again, I love this series. I love the characters, and, as I am nearing my own retirement and love to walk, I get itchy feet while watching the series: I want to roam, natter, and get into goofy scrapes. What a lovely life.",1410220800,,222,4.186046511627907
8252993,5,B0013U4RSC,"The adventures of Compo, Cleggy, and whoever the third man is at the time, are always delightful. My mother's a huge fan of the show, and I've been slowly getting her all the series on DVD. She does so adore her ""old men"". It's a shame that Foggy left, though. He'll always be my favourite third man.",1395187200,,300,4.280701754385965
