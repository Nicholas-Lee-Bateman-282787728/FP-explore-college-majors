5372919,4,B009YQJ37M,"Good video for teaching basic shapes to toddlers and preschoolers. Introduces the handicapped dog Dash and ""Beaver Brothers"" (construction workers who help the other animals solve problems.) Leapfrog always has a way of teaching children multiple lessons at once. The key lessons here, other than shapes of course, are equality and including all of our friends when playing. The friends use shapes to make the park accessible and safe for everyone. I find the songs to be slightly less grating on a parents nerves than some of the other Leapfrog videos (as great as Numberland is some of those songs can get stuck in your head for days). Overall it's a pretty cute movie and I don't regret buying it. I feel like your child could very quickly learn the basic shapes if they can already count to four. It kept my son (he just turned two) captivated for the whole duration of the video. Even though he has difficulty pronouncing the names of the shapes it is clear that he grasps the concept and recognizes the four basic shapes after watching the video twice. Effective and entertaining.

Also outlined in this video:

Small, medium, large
Circle, square, rectangle, triangle
Early measurement skills (using mice instead of inches...ok), length and height in a very brief overview.

Cons (Personal opinions and why I only gave it 4 stars):

Seems to be a little bit slower paced than some of the other Leapfrog videos.

Measuring with mice is just a little weird. I am sure it may be a good way to introduce the idea to toddlers but I would have rather seen a tape measure or other ""real world"" tool that kids can later associate with measurement.

I would really have liked to see some more complex shapes on this video. (hexagon, trapezoid, etc.) Kids can pick things up incredibly quickly from these videos. If my 2 year old can learn 26 letters, their sounds and how to count to ten (and not just recite the numbers) then he certainly could have picked up 8-10 shapes.",1359158400,9,1971,4.698550724637681

5372936,5,B009YQJ37M,"there is nothing better than the LeapFrog series for teaching children shapes, letter, numbers, and phonics. It's designed to capture their attention with catchy, easy to learn tunes. I bought the first one for my grandson when he was 12 months old, and he could say his ABC's perfectly by the time he was 14 months old. These DVD's sure beat putting the children in front of mindless videos that teach them nothing. I highly recommend as an excellent teaching tool!",1416441600,,466,4.765432098765432

5372949,3,B009YQJ37M,"THE GOOD: It's a decent educational video and my two-year old asks to see it about once a week.  They teach basic shapes very effectively.
THE WEIRD: the ""measuring mice"" are just damn strange, no other way I can label it. Why try to teach kids how to measure things with mice?  Damned odd. Would be 5 stars if not for this weirdness with mice",1403308800,,343,4.2615384615384615

5372951,5,B009YQJ37M,"Even though our daughter is just 2 she really gets into this video on shapes. Scout and his group learn shapes from the songs and in this case the Beaver Brothers building. Children learn triangles, circles, rectangles and squares in a very entertaining way. Music is very good, and are very easy for children to learn to sing with the characters.",1390953600,,347,4.704918032786885

5372955,4,B009YQJ37M,The movies are greatly animated and full of colors.  They integrate the lessons well. Wish they were just a bit longer,1382659200,,118,4.619047619047619

5372957,4,B009YQJ37M,It is an ok video but really it should focus more on the shapes! This video is trying to teach too many things at once. Could be better,1380672000,,135,3.857142857142857

Even my two year old who is not really interested in videos loves this one and already knows her shapes.  It gets requested over and over.  The songs are catchy and the characters are sweet.

5372963,5,B009YQJ37M,Excellent for children - especially if introduced between the ages of 18-24 months when they are beginning to absorb and repeat everything they hear like little sponges.  This one is so entertaining and has great music/songs.  A Leap Frog DVD favorite!,1366070400,,252,5.121951219512195

5372966,5,B009YQJ37M,Kids love all the leap frog videos great music and fun. We have all the videos and watch them daily.,1360195200,,100,4.05
5372967,4,B009YQJ37M,"We love the Leapfrog videos and this one did not disappoint.  It is a 30 minute DVD featuring Scout and his friends all talking about shapes, sizes and measurements.  It is basic, so more so for a child learning their shapes and sizes.  The DVD says 2-5 years old, which would probably benefit more so a 2-4 year old.  My just turned 6 year old though sat and watched the whole DVD with his younger siblings and liked it.  I think the animation is super kid-friendly and adorable.  Like I said shapes are covered but what I thought was helpful was measurements and sizes.  For example, the one character draws a teeter tooter and the other one builds it, to scale, so its the same size as the drawing!  It was supposed to be obviously built bigger.  Another thing they do is measure items, using mice that they count - its cute because they show how kids can use whatever to measure something and then just say its ""10 cars"" or ""5 cups.""

Overall, this is a very cute DVD.  It is a whole episode and easy for kids to follow along.  There is also lots of music, which my kids were excited to dance around and sing along to.  This DVD is perfect for any child learning their shapes and numbers, it is a fun way to reinforce them.",1359936000,,1227,4.282608695652174
8545356,4,B009YQJ37M,the whole series of LeapFrog videos are excellent in my opinion.  something that kids like while being educational at the same time.  thats a win-win in my opinion,1495152000,,163,4.785714285714286

8545359,2,B009YQJ37M,"Three strikes against this video:

1. ""Square, circle, and rectangle, triangle"" is a line in one of the songs. The ""and"" is clearly in the wrong place.

2. My kid now sings the ""small, large, medium"" song, which is not the right way to arrange things in real life.

3. Measuring mice. Really? Why not introduce a ruler or a tape measure? I get that they didn't want to use inches since they'd have to re-dub it as centimeters elsewhere in the world but using identical mice to measure objects is just ridiculous.",1467331200,,512,4.483870967741935

8545362,5,B009YQJ37M,This is currently my 2 year olds favorite program. They have this on Netflix but I wanted the disk for her to watch in the car on a road trip. These disks are only a single 20 something minute show each but worth it if your kid loves it. Added benefit that they're learning all about shapes! My daughter 'sings' along and easily recognizes all the shapes they talk about. Bonus that it's not too annoying to listen to as an adult!!,1462060800,,431,4.2682926829268295
