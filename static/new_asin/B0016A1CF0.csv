8261784,5,B0016A1CF0,"I have struggled to find this show online since Netflix dropped it, but have to resort to discs etc.  One of the funniest sketch shows in recent years.  It's British in its execution, but even folks who don't typically go for that should enjoy this edgy show.  My personal favorite is the evil genius's henchman who gets tired of all the needlessly ambiguous innuendo... ""'Have him removed'? 'Take him out of the picture'? I thought we agreed that these terms were needlessly ambiguous? We all agreed that when we want someone murdered, as in deliberately killed to death, that's what we were going to say!"".  Not to mention the inappropriate sports announcers, caveman CSI, or the question of where all the people who actually bought avocado colored bathroom fixtures went.  Innovative and tightly edited, it's a good watch.",1490140800,,825,4.949275362318841
