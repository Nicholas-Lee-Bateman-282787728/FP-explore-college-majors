5158692,5,B008FXLYNG,I remember Fat Albert when I was a kid.  I must of really never paid attention but that was a cartoon that you learned something from.  Not like the junk on TV today. Fat Albert was such a good caring young man and a role model.  Yeah he was overweight but it is the inside that counts.  Wish this show would make a comeback for the kids today. Always great service at Amazon.,1360454400,5,376,4.109589041095891

8527379,4,B008FXLYNG,"This disc delivers what it promises, the three Fat Albert holiday specials for Halloween, Christmas and Easter.  Oddly, Bill Cosby doesn't appear onscreen in live action footage as he did in the Saturday morning episodes, and only the Easter special has a Brown Hornet sequence. There are no extras on this disc, but the low price makes it hard to complain about their absence.  For fans who want to have every episode of this classic Saturday morning show, or for those who are just looking for nostalgic holiday fun, this is a good disc at a good price.",1427760000,,555,4.653061224489796
