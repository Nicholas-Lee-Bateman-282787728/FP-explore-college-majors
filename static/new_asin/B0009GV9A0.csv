8060501,5,B0009GV9A0,"Great documentary. And inside look as to the importance of the Louisiana Hayride in a very formative decade of music history. I loved the tidbit of history that Elvis signed a year long contract to be back on the Hayride in Shreveport every Saturday night. By the second year and second contract, his career took off and they paid $10,000 to get out of the contract and perform one last show. It shows the importance of the Hayride to book their for a year of Saturday nights! Other great stories from artist interviews! Great stuff!",1282953600,,533,4.621052631578947
8060502,4,B0009GV9A0,"This documentary is narrated by Hank Williams Jr., and he does an excellent job describing the historical significance of the ""Louisiana Hayride"" Radio Show, that was broadcast ""live"" from the historic Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. It's glory years were between 1948 and 1958. Hank Jr. was born in Shreveport, while his dad Hank Williams was performing on the weekly show.

This documentary is based on old photographs, film clips, live transcriptions of old radio show recordings, and commentaries from personnel from KWKH the radio station who sponsored the show. You get several commentaries from Hoarce Logan, who was the ""emcee"" of the show. Plus, you get some commentaries from performers who appeared on the show, and commentaries from fans who attended the show.

This show was known for being the ""Cradle of the Stars"" because, many country music stars and others got their start performing on this show.
These stars include: Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Johnny Horton, George Jones, and sideman James Burton, and many, many more.

The historic Shreveport Municipal Auditorium was built in the 1920's. It is currently open for tours. In front of the building, there are two statues: One of Elvis, and One of James Burton.

This is a great documentary about a historical piece of American Music History, and I highly recommend it, and if you're ever in Shreveport, please go by and visit the historic auditorium, and take the tour, you'll enjoy it. Thanks, and may God Bless!!!",1236384000,,1502,5.118367346938776
8060503,1,B0009GV9A0,"I was hoping to get to see some good vintage performances from some classic artists. Instead I seen lots of talking and a few short short snippets of performances. What a waste, I know somewhere there is archived film footage rotting away in a box somewhere. I could be watching that instead of watching a whole lot of documentary.",1206230400,3,331,4.627118644067797
8060504,1,B0009GV9A0,"If that's the same thing I saw on video years ago, there's probably no more than 2 or 3 minutes about Elvis... Remember, this is the story of the history of the Louisiana Hayride... NOT Elvis at the Louisiana Hayride.. (and that's only 62 minutes, so don't expect much Elvis on this DVD). If you ALSO like the L.H, then get it. (But if you are only an Elvis fan, not a L.H. fan, like me, this may not be worth it... get it on sale at Wallmart, or Ebay)
