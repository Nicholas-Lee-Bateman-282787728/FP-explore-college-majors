2485125,5,B000E3720E,"I loved evel kneivel, I think absolute evel is the best documentary yet about the famous daredevil. It goes into great detail about his life, his jumps, and his failures. I have watched it over and over, I do not think I will ever get tired of watching a great program like this. I even had a evel kneivel bike that I got for christmas one year. I was the only kid in my small town that had one, and oh boy I got hurt on it a few times. I love Evel, Harley Davidson motorcycles and this fine video from the history channel.",1207180800,2,523,4.038461538461538
2485126,5,B000E3720E,"""Absolute Evel"" is a fascinating story about a dying breed in this country - The ultimate entrepreneur. Until I watched this DVD I was under a totally different opinion of Evel Knievel. However, after I saw how he grew up, everything he experienced as an individual, as a family man, how he crafted his rise to fame/success, as well as his failures in life, I had a new found respect for this man. This is an excellent movie to watch if you think that holding down a 8 to 5 job is tough way to make a living.",1202860800,,508,4.1938775510204085
2485127,5,B000E3720E,"The History Channel did a great job on the docu, having the real Evel Knievel do his own bio was a plus. He gives you the only true idea of how he really lived his life. The only problem I could see was it could have been another hour longer.",1201392000,,242,3.86
2485128,5,B000E3720E,"I have a few documentaries about Evel on DVD but this is the best by far.  It has been very well put together and has footage of all the major jumps.  Towards the end it even includes footage of his son Robbie doing the Ceaser's Palace jump his father first did back in 1968 (though with a much more modern bike).  If you love Evel, don't hesitate in getting this documentary.",1198627200,,376,4.267605633802817

2485131,2,B000E3720E,I had hoped for more.  This was mostly a dissertation by Mr Knievel about himself.  Would have liked to hear from other people involved at the time.,1420588800,,148,4.444444444444445

2485135,5,B000E3720E,"Of all books and/or videos that are available-this is the most comprehensive picture your going to receive of the man and what he meant to all ""Evel"" fans.  However the video does not address his bi-polar personality and other negative aspects of the man but lets face it you have to be mentally screwed up to do what he did. There is a book out on e-bay Evel Kneivel on tour by Saltman that is absolutely the worst read possible.  They want 250.00 dollars for the book.  I was able to inter library loan the book for free by the Carnegie library system in Pittsburgh. Never waste your money on this book. There are other biographical books on this man that are great as well.",1415059200,,676,4.392

2485138,5,B000E3720E,Knievel still couldn't manage he truth.  Good interview.  Knievel finally admits that the sky cycle  release lever was duck taped.  It was a hoax from th beginning.,1377993600,,164,4.962962962962963
2485139,5,B000E3720E,"Disciples of Evel, you know who you are. You're the ones who built your own ramps to jump your bikes and motorcycles over what ever obstacles you could find. And sometimes you came down clean and other times you went over the handlebars and got your helmet scraped on the ground. You did remember to wear a helmet, didn't you? Robert Craig Knievel said you never got on a bike without your helmet. Find out more and more what Evel's mindset was as he entered the arena to risk death as a projectile propelled by a Harley Davidson. You're going to enjoy this doc.

And while you're at it, check Amazon for more DVD's and books about the King Of The Motorcycle Stuntment. The King with a helmet for a crown.",1377043200,,705,4.3816793893129775

8104714,5,B000E3720E,"I bought this a long time ago and was eager to watch it - and I was NOT let down in the least by the film!!  It ranks up there with, ""Evel Knievel: Last Of The Gladiators"" which is a film from the middle 1980s about Evel.  Unfortunately, that film is no longer in print - but I have it on DVD, as well.  The coolest feature about this film, ""Absolute Evel"", is that he gets to tell his story in his own words - and, believe me, he doesn't mince words or leave any details out!

I loved his recollection of when he read, ""Evel On Tour"", by Sheldon Saltman and what he did to him after reading the book:  he goes and finds him out near the MGM lot and, with even his own arms broken from the then-recent accident during filming of his final television special of the jump over a tank of sharks (which failed during a practice jump where Evel hit a camera guy and accidentally knocked the camera guy's eye out and he broke both of his own arms - which made him decide to stop jumping - he finds Saltman and, bringing two other men with him, he beats the crap out of Saltman and lands him in the hospital - which, unfortunately, lands Evel in jail for beating Saltman up (if someone wrote in a book about ME hating my Mom - which I don't - I don't think that I could keep from beating him up, either)

All in all, this is definitely one MOT to be missed!!!  Get it while you can!  It's a GREAT film and a GREAT tribute to an awesome showman - MR. EVEL KNIEVEL!",1441670400,,1456,4.03125
