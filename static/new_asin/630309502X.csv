555966,3,630309502X,"Susannah (Shirley Temple) is the sole survivor of a wagon train which was attacked by Blackfoot Indians. The mounties who found her took her back with them to their fort, where she soon became a pet of the mounties. Inspector Montague (Randolph Scott) and his orderly Patrick are her substitute father and mother.

The Blackfoot chief comes to parlay, and agrees to leave his son Little Chief at the fort as hostage while he sends Wolf Pelt, one of his lieutenants, out to find the raiders. They are also assumed to be the ones who stole a bunch of horses from the railroad building camp. The Captain of the fort is willing to take the chief's word for it that he knew nothing of the raids.

There's a love interest (and a target for Susannah's jealousy) in the visit of the Captain's daughter from Toronto. Susannah teaches Montie how to dance, and then watches glumly while he dances with the young lady. Little Chief predicts Montie will ""make her his squaw."" This infuriates Susannah, who has decided she is in love with Montie. (She's about seven or eight, but never mind that.)

Little Chief and Susannah become ""blood brothers,"" and he shares a secret with her: Wolf Pelt is the one who led the raiders and stole the horses. It was when he tried to sell the railroad men their own stolen horses that real trouble was kicked up. Wolf Pelt returned to the Indian camp after the railroad men beat up him and his men for trying to sell them the stolen horses. He demands war, saying that the head of the railroad builders threatened to bring a lot of soldiers out to destroy all the Indians. Of course, he does not have the authority to do that, but the Indians don't know that.

Of course courage and daring on the part of Little Chief and Susannah save the day when the Indians are prepared to burn Montie at the stake. And of course the end is a peace treaty, and Susannah sharing in smoking the peace pipe.

It's cute, but not very profound.",1337126400,,1948,4.476056338028169
555967,5,630309502X,I have wanted to get this movie for some time. I have seen it on TV and wanted it for my collection. It will well worth the money; you won't be disapointed.,1300924800,,156,3.90625
555968,4,630309502X,"Maybe not as cute as her earlier movies, but it still is a entertaining, clean, family movie. It is not a musical, I think she only sings one song in it, however both children and adults in my family enjoyed it.  Randolf Scott is a good actor and added to the enjoyment of the movie. I'm not going to give away the plot, but Shirley plays the only survivor of a wagon train when she comes to live with the mounties. She befriends the chief's son who is trying to maintain a good relationship with the mounties. The most charming scene is when Shirley teaches Scott to dance.  Scott also costars with Shirley in Rebbecca of Sunny brook Farm. I also found out recently that Shirley played a small part in one of Scott's films.",1300838400,,724,4.355555555555555
555969,3,630309502X,"Shirley Temple's popularity at the box office was starting to wane when she starred in SUSANNAH OF THE MOUNTIES, an adventure set on the Canadian frontier.  Despite the limitations of the material, fans of Temple should enjoy this little gem.

Temple plays Susannah Sheldon, who narrowly survives an horrific Indian attack and is rescued by the Mounties, led by Monty (Randolph Scott).  Little Sue goes to live with Monty and his colleagues at the local fort, where pretty soon her unique powers of diplomacy are needed to help the strained relations between Indians and Mounties.

Pre-teen Temple was in her difficult transition period when she starred in SUSANNAH OF THE MOUNTIES, a film that tries to showcase her dramatic skills (at the expense of the cute musical numbers she was famous for).  Audiences would never quite forgive Temple for committing the ""cardinal sin"" of growing up; a real shame because she could have made quite a career with screwball comedy (as later evidenced in ""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer"" and ""Almost a Bride"", her final movie in 1949).

SUSANNAH OF THE MOUNTIES reunited Temple with her ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" co-star Randolph Scott; the movie also features talented British leading lady Margaret Lockwood of ""The Lady Vanishes"" fame (in one of her early attempts to break into American film).

The DVD gives you the option of watching the movie in original B&W or a computer-colourised version, plus the trailer.  The coloured version of the film is actually quite good with lifelike colouring and great shadow detail.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1197072000,4,1598,5.138996138996139
555970,3,630309502X,"20th Century Fox tried to rework the plot of ""Wee Willie Winkie"" in this Shirley Temple flick.  One key person missing from the picture was director John Ford.  The product suffers without Ford's vision of humor, action, and sentiment.  Don't get me wrong.  Shirley Temple is still America's Sweetheart.  She is the lone survivor of a wagon train massacre, and RCMP Randolph Scott comes to her aid.  This time it's American Indians on the warpath.  Shirley almost single-handed prevents war on the Canadian frontier, while charming everybody in sight.  By 1939, Shirley was starting to show definite signs of growing up, dangerous in a child star.  She has a crush on Scott and tries to keep him from mooning around a good-looking woman visiting the outpost.  As usual, Shirley's ""isn't that cute"" antics are amusing.  Her culture clashes with the deadpan Indian kid, Little Chief, are comic.  There is even some Western style action-adventure.  Victor Jory is menacing if somewhat cliched as a villainous Indian.  The usual elements just don't jell as well as they did in ""Wee Willie Winkie.""  As wholesome family entertainment, all Shirley Temple films are a success, regardless.  This one is pleasant, but not Shirley's best.  ;-)",1023321600,10,1233,5.054726368159204

556056,5,630309502X,"Shirley Temple plays the lone wagon train survivor of an indian attack in Canada in this charming little story.  While it's full of stuff that's probably ""politically incorrect"" now, it's still a cute story and it follows the standard plot for most of her movies:  cute little girl helps save the day for someone she loves.  The smoking of the pipe for a treaty makes for a cute scene and so does the indian dancing.  The young man who played the son of the Chief was perfect for the part and made a good partner for Shirley.  Teens will turn up their noses at it and so may older kids, but the 6-10 crowd will probably like it, especially if they like horses, westerns, or Shirley Temple.",1410134400,,689,4.393700787401575

7836904,3,630309502X,"Susannah of the Mounties, 1939 film

In the late 19th century the Canadians built a railroad across the country to the Pacific ocean. The Native Americans objected to the taking of their lands. It begins with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police finding a wagon train that was attacked by Indians. One young girl alone survived. Susannah is taken to their fort. The Colonel in charge arranges a meeting with the Indians to settle any conflict in a peaceful manner. The Little Chief is left behind as a hostage; he will learn the white mans ways. [This custom goes back centuries in European history.] Susannah meets the Little Chief for humorous events. Smoking a peace pipe? The Indian Chief wants to keep the peace and find the guilty who raided the railroad camp and that wagon train. There is a comic scene where Susannah dances with Little Chief. Scenes of life in the fort pad out the story.

There is conflict over a horse sale; were they stolen? Some Indians want to make war to keep the White Man out of their lands. Signal fires foretell of a big war. The Indians to on the path of war and attack villages. Can a few Troopers fight off 2,000 Indian warriors? The gates of the fort are closed, they prepare for any emergency. The Indians attack the undermanned fort, setting roofs on fire. This distraction allows Indians to climb the walls and open the gates! One man is missing. A messenger brings the terms: end the railroad and leave. Or the captive will die. Susannah leaves on her pony; what can she do? She wants to talk to Big Eagle, the Indian Chief. The Indians learn the Redcoats are coming at night. Susannah pleads with Big Eagle for peace. Only the Redcoats can speak for the Government. Who is lying? The Medicine Man renders his judgment. The leader of the Redcoats smokes a peace pipe with Big Eagle. Peace in our time?

Note how this plot echoes The Littlest Rebel. There were few Indian wars in Canada like in the US because they were treated better and the Government kept its promises. Also, no findings of gold and silver on Indian lands. The prairie lands in Canada were developed to produce wheat, making Canada one of the top exporters of this food crop.",1451174400,,2185,4.58312020460358
