8284529,5,B001BSBBT4,"Here is Shirley Temple as she started out. An amazingly well done portrayal of a very talented young woman who would become the biggest child star of all time (remember, the Olsen twins came much later!). I have two nieces that also loved watching this, although small children might not understand this quite as well.
Legend Films also did a top notch job on the colorization of this release so I gave it 5 stars!!",1395964800,,415,4.546666666666667
8284530,2,B001BSBBT4,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who's only 2, but I thought this would introduce her to Shirley Temple as the singing, dancing child we all loved. I thought it would at least hold her attention for that reason. It turns out that Shirley is only one of many characters in the skits. She isn't really singled out and the concept of the stories are more like Spanky and our Gang than what I remember about Shirley Temple stories. Very disappointed. If you want the real Shirley Temple experience, don't buy this.",1356566400,,515,4.608695652173913
8284531,3,B001BSBBT4,"my daughter saw shirley temple on commercials so i decided to get her a dvd to see how she would like it.the quality is amazing but the content is not for young children at  all.you would think since she is a child it would be age appropriate but its not. They show kissing and hugging and that send out the wrong message to my child.she barely sings,if i were you i would search for a dvd i know isn't showing the wrong things",1330041600,,427,4.144578313253012
8284532,4,B001BSBBT4,"No collection of Shirley Temple films is complete without her enjoyable shorts from the ""Baby Burlesks"", produced by Educational Films/Comedy House in 1932. These little films provided Temple with the springboard needed to become a bankable child star, and the success of the films paved the way for Temple's later films with Universal and Twentieth Century-Fox. In the films, four-year-old Temple and a cast of talented tots (including Danny Boone Jr., Georgie Smith and Sidney Kilbrick) play adults in parodies of grownup movies and musicals. The ""Burlesks"" were produced quite economically by Jack Hays, but were quickly overshadowed by the ""Our Gang"" comedies, and the company folded in 1934.

All seven films featured on this disc have been newly-colourised and restored, quite simply these films have never looked better. Legend Films has released this disc as a supplement to their series of ""Shirley Temple's Storybook"" DVDs. Includes:

""Kid 'in Hollywood"" - In the heydey of Hollywood talkies, exhausted leading lady 'The Great Snobbo' walks off her latest picture, so the director hires a young unknown called Morelegs Sweetrick... A great sendup of Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich films.

""Glad Rags to Riches"" - Temple plays a glamorous nightclub entertainer called La Belle Diaperina, and gets to wow the crowds with her singing and dancing, whilst trying to escape the advances of her sleazy manager.

""War Babies"" - In an obvious dig at the French Foreign Legion/Gary Cooper epics of the period, Temple plays a sophisticated cabaret singer who charms the G.I.'s.

""Kid in Africa"" - Temple plays a gun-ho missionary, determined to tame the natives.

""The Kid's Last Fight"" - One of the rare titles. Temple plays the pretty girlfriend of a prizefighter who becomes his lucky charm.

""The Pie-Covered Wagon"" - An hilarious Wild West parody; Temple plays a damsel in distress who gets kidnapped by Indians.

""Polly-Tix in Washington"" - Temple plays a young innocent who is hired to ensure that a senator's campaign becomes the most successful.",1244592000,3,2055,5.206060606060606
8284533,5,B001BSBBT4,"Shirley Temple: The Early Years contains the famous ""Baby Burlesk"" shorts that launched the young star's career and endeared Shirley to fans worldwide for decades to come.  Temple herself hosts this exciting jaunt down memory lane, which is itself a wonderful example of Depression-era film's favorite memes: adorable children behaving as adults (ala the Little Rascals).  Most of us, however, would simply be contented to relive the same moments of Shirley that we remember from childhood.

Working closely with Shirley Temple herself, Legend Films has taken these wonderful moments and added their trademarked splash of color to the otherwise black and white images, to great effect.  When you compare these newly colorized shorts to some of Shirley's original color material, you'll be awestruck at the substantial difference in quality.  Some colorized classic films have that ""look"" about them, where you can tell that the color was artificially stenciled in on top of the original image: this is not that sort of job.  No, the color in all of these shorts looks as though it had been there all along.

For the avid collector or the parent wanting to introduce their children to one of cinema's greatest treasures, you'll be hard-pressed to beat the value of Shirley Temple's Early Years.",1228176000,5,1293,5.157894736842105
