5738420,5,B00CT13GL8,"I absolutely loved this show. I was so disappointed when NBC abruptly canceled this series, on a cliff hanger no less. NBC is now famous for dropping very well produced series due to poor programming slots. Las Vegas had a wonderful Cast that had chemistry! This was a very well written and produced show.
I have owned the entire series for years now on DVD and I never get tired of watching them.
I only wish that a Blu-Ray version would be released. Not holding my breath on that.",1375056000,21,482,4.426966292134831
5738421,3,B00CT13GL8,"Las Vegas is a fun, slightly silly romp around Sin City.  The first three seasons do a great job of capturing the Vegas feel while mixing both comedy and suspense with the result being a  fairly addictive show.  I would say the most important thing to note is that NBC cancelled the show abruptly, so season five ends with a BIG cliffhanger that never gets resolved.  It's so disappointing. That being said, if this is a decent price, the first three seasons are extremely enjoyable and are still worth your time.",1374969600,34,513,4.604395604395604

5738440,4,B00CT13GL8,"The only reason the show isn't perfect is the series finale, which ends on a cliffhanger that is never resolved.",1423958400,4,112,4.65
5738441,2,B00CT13GL8,"The commentary should have been submitted as additional features. The fact that it was recorded over the top of various episodes caused those episodes to be lost. No music, dialog, the entire episode was lost. I paid for a full box set of the show, and I was disappointed to find I am missing several episodes.",1413676800,2,310,4.553571428571429

5738445,5,B00CT13GL8,I have always been facinated by Las Vegas and this TV series showed the background operation of a major casino.  To me it is very interesting and answers a lot of questions that a visitor to Las Vegas would like to know!!!,1379808000,2,222,4.285714285714286
5738446,4,B00CT13GL8,"So far the series has been good, have seen many of the episodes as re-runs on TV but there were still some gaps in what I had seen. Now at least I can fill in the gaps.",1379289600,,168,3.5675675675675675

5738459,5,B00CT13GL8,"The show was great with all of the twists and turns that made me always want to get to the next disc. The show is timeless and will be entertaining as long as Vegas exists. Too bad that there were not additional seasons to develop defferent plots.

5738463,4,B00CT13GL8,I always loved this show and was happy to find it offered as a bundle . The original order seemed to have been a repack thou .

5738464,2,B00CT13GL8,"Las Vegas was a very exciting series... At first . The first season, lots of fun, very exciting. Great cast lots of chemistry.
Season 2 was ok.. But then SEASON 3  happened... Where do I start ?? First, they got rid of Nessa ( Marsha Thomason ) then .... The most horrible 3 words anyone could utter ........ LAURA FLYNN BOYLE .. ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Was cast as the new casino owner. Lets see .. 0 acting ability... 0 chemistry with the cast.... The writing for this season was horrible ( culminating with Boyle' s character being pushed off the monticito 's roof, by a strong gust of wind , a nd her dead body landing in a shoe store?!?.. Oh, and did I mention the music track during this scene was from THE WIZARD OF OZ?????????????) NEED I SAY MORE?????????

Sorry to rant .... But the show had sooo many possibilities, and they blew it. I have season one . The only season that matters.",1376438400,2,889,4.414634146341464

5738467,5,B00CT13GL8,"I loved this show. The writers should have saved tearing down the Montecito until the end of the series.

Demolishing the Montecito while Gladys Knight was singing ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" plus the scene showing everyone going their separate ways would have been the perfect series finale.

I still watch it in syndication.",1375228800,,326,5.132075471698113
5738468,5,B00CT13GL8,"This was an underated great show funny but serious subjects, and really showed how a hotel in Vegas was run from the inside. Love James Caan,Vanessa Marcil too HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1375056000,6,176,4.9

8585991,3,B00CT13GL8,"It was unopened, which was great.  But quite a few of the disks had what appeared to be water stains on the readable sides...whatever it was was water soluble.  Unlikely that it hurt anything, and the disks played ok, but disconcerting.  The quality of video is shoddy, but that's how these were shot...nothing HD about any of this and even burning to .MKV files and then trying to clean it up with Handbrake or push the definition was no better.  If you're expecting blu ray, these aren't.",1520726400,,490,4.597701149425287
8585992,4,B00CT13GL8,"When this was a weekly television series it was must see TV for me each week. About a collection of workers at a Las Vegas casino, their lives, loves, and guest star customers. Engaging.",1519862400,,186,4.5
8585993,4,B00CT13GL8,"I love the series.  Unfortunately these disks have quite a few issues.  There are no scratches or visible problems with any of the disks, but there is at least 1 or 2 bad disks each season (that is trying on multiple players, so it is the disks that are the issue).  For the most part I can watch most episodes on a bad disk, but it has troubles with stopping, skipping a minute or two, not working from the menu.  Very annoying, but I decided to keep mine, as I can watch almost all the shows.",1519084800,,494,4.114583333333333
8585994,1,B00CT13GL8,I am on season 2 and so far have had three of the disks that are dirty with crap you cant get off. The disks won't read in the player.,1518480000,,134,3.5
8585995,2,B00CT13GL8,"This is my second set. The first set I sent back because at least one episode per disc was unplayable with all the skips. This second set is still damaged, but fewer discs, at least one episode on a disc per season, still skips. Apparently there was very little to no quality control in making these discs!!!!",1515974400,4,309,4.43859649122807
