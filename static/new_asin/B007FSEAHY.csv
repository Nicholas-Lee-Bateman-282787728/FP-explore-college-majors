5083000,1,B007FSEAHY,"As long as WB insists on Ultra-violet digital copies, there's no way I would buy this set.  I want a digital copy I can actually watch without having to stream or sign up for another service.",1330646400,36,191,4.305555555555555
5083001,5,B007FSEAHY,"So, I just purchased this item yesterday. To offer full disclosure, Barnes and Noble runs a 40% off all Blu Rays the week before Christmas, and they also send out a 25% off coupon and I am a member's card holder, so that gets me another 10%. So, my purchase price for this item, new, was only 218 after tax. I absolutely feel this set is worth the asking price, but I couldn't justify that kind of an expense.  Shaving 130 dollars off makes a HUGE difference.

As with most other reviewers who actually have this item and didn't simply review ahead of time, this thing is HUGE and HEAVY.  It comes in it's own ""slip sleeve"" of sorts, packed nicely in styrofoam.  Most of the reviewers have exhaustively covered all the features. The highlights are the cloth tapestry map, the Blueprint and the Noble Collection Horcrux.  The biggest selling feature is the box itself.  I own about 25 box sets.  NOTHING competes with it.  It's gorgeous and makes a great ""look and play"" talking piece to display in your home.

As far as the features and what most of the complaints have been on here, let me address a couple more things.  First off, I bought the first two ultimate editions on DVD and then stopped.  Blu Ray started getting big, and I knew they'd release a box set.  I sold off my other Potter discs and I have never owned a Blu Ray of any of them.  So that makes a HUGE difference in deciding to shell out for this.  It's not a double dip, because I never dipped first.

Second, I understand the frustration of not having extended editions.  I would trade this gorgeous box for 5 hour long cuts of each of the movies, giving them the LOTR treatment of HOURS of extras.  However, that's not how the movies were shot or budgeted.  The first movie was greenlit before Goblet of Fire even came out (the book, of course). They didn't know the phenomenon would reach the frenzy it did at that point, and they budgeted it fairly low.  Not to mention, for at least 6 of the films, the main cast members were children and they couldn't shoot exhaustive extra hours due to labor laws.  So, take that complaint out of the decision process of buying this set. Deleted scenes? Only ones we get are the ones that have been released. There aren't any more.  We'd all love it if there was more, but I love that WB recognized this and did something to make it up.  Again, this set is STUNNING and the nicest I've ever seen of its kind.

If you don't have the ultimate editions, or you love a set that doubles as artwork, or you're just a Potter nut and want to own the nicest Potter collection item there is, I totally recommend this set.  And if you search a Barnes and Noble near you that has it...go!  You can get the same deal and make this a true steal.",1330646400,10,2742,4.339882121807466
5083002,3,B007FSEAHY,"At first I was very excited to see this but now I am disappointed. Where are the Extended Cuts for ""ALL"" of the DVD's??? I thought with this collection they would finally put all of the movies out with Extended Cuts. Very upset. Then the Price is very expensive. How do they think can afford this?? I will have to save most of the year for it. This is Crazy. People don't have this kind of money, especially with the way the economy is right now. I hope Warner Bros thinks about the price and adding the extended cuts before this comes out.",1330646400,12,540,4.252427184466019
5083003,1,B007FSEAHY,"I normally use the comments for this type of things, but since there's already 4 guys that gave somewhat cheerish reviews for this upcoming package, I'm going to expose my concern...

$500 for this set??!!!!

The specs (so far) says that this box have 31 discs.  Why so many discs??  It's been proved that for a digital copy is only necessary a code.  Once you download your copy, the disc is unuseful.  So there's a bunch of fat on the set.

I'm all for the Blu Ray versions only.  I know that lots of people won't mind to get the DVD versions but... couldn't they separate the Blu Ray from the DVDs??.  It seems so overkilled.  The only thing that include the Blu-Ray and DVD version of the same movies is to increase cost.

Also it is published that all the extras in the previous versions will be included, and that 5 hours of new material well be also incorportated.  Only 5 hours?  I definably expected more.  This might not be relevant for many of you, but to me, it strikes me as odd.

Anyway, I know we still have to wait for the proper announcement and the real specs, but believe me, so far NOTHING justify the price.  I mean, even if Amazon cut the price 50%, the price would still be $249.99 which is still too expensive.

UPDATE 03222012:
-----------------

Here I have a link with a more detailed specs:

[...]

The box is still (to me) terribly overpriced and retarded.  Only ultimate extended editions for 1 and 2?

Still not good enough.

What do you think?",1330646400,33,1475,4.401486988847584
5083004,2,B007FSEAHY,"Honestly not all that excited for this after seeing it. Wish it included the extended edition of all the movies, with deleted scenes added in. Also, anyone besides me notice that the colors are all off in the inside of the top of the box? The Slytherin snake is blue, the Gryffindor lion is yellow, etc. It just does not look right to me. Actually highly disappointed in WB.",1330560000,14,374,4.434782608695652
5083005,5,B007FSEAHY,"I cannot possibly put into words how excited I am for this release!!! I have been waiting for this for a long time. Not only do you get all the movies (both discs from each movie) but you get over a dozen more discs of special features! I think it's a little pricey, but for the true fan of both the books and the movies, it will be a real treat to be the proud owner of this excellent collection.",1330560000,7,397,3.975
5083006,5,B007FSEAHY,"Everyone who wrote a bad review for this was not being fair. The reviews came out before the box was even released.

5083008,5,B007FSEAHY,"I own this and it is one of my favorite possessions! That being said, the price on here is ridiculous. I bought mine at Costco a few years ago for $250. It's an amazing set but don't be ripped off!!",1482624000,2,198,3.975
5083009,5,B007FSEAHY,This is such an amazing collection I've been a fan since I was really young and now at 23 still enjoy it I saw this collection a couple years back for a ridiculously high price on places like eBay stumbled upon it here on amazon for a good price totally worth every penny,1482278400,,271,4.132075471698113

5083011,5,B007FSEAHY,"I purchased this when it originally was released back around 2010 - 2012 for about $300.  I'm not sure what's happened to warrant the 300%+ increase in price since then.  That being said, I have really enjoyed this product.  I have probably watched the movies (all of them) hundreds of times, to the point where a couple of the blurays will freeze at certain spots.  I really enjoyed the extended versions of the first couple of films and was sorry that they didn't include extended versions of all of them for the price, but whatever...  The extras and knick-knacks that came with the set?  Meh! Part of the set, part of the charm.  But I would buy it again for the original price.  I wouldn't and won't spend $1000 for it, but there are some die-hard Potter fans with money to burn who will.  Not gonna judge anyone for that.",1480636800,,827,4.46

5083018,2,B007FSEAHY,"Look I bought this when it first became available for sale and absolutely love it the drawers with the extra trinkets is really fun to go through. My issue is NOT with the product or the quality of it. My problem is I was going to buy this for a friend for their birthday and came to Amazon to get it as a gift for them.  What's really chapping my a** is the fact that people a trying to hijack you on this price. This set was anywhere from $150-180 brand new. Now these places are trying to get $760 - $1200 ??????? I don't know if any sensible person, no matter how big of a Potter fan you are who would pay this price. I bought screen used props from The Sorcerer's Stone for about half of the lowest price offered on this set here. Talk about price gouging.

5083019,5,B007FSEAHY,"Bought this when it first came out for $350.00.  It's absolutely amazing!  Easily the best collectable movie set I've ever purchased.
It's not a cheap cardboard box, but very high quality.  The amount of extra features it gives for every movie is outstanding, and the presentation of the movie cases is awesome.
The map inside...the horcrux...and more...I can't say enough about how happy I am that I got a copy of the limited edition!
I've seen it sell for as much as $1500, which makes me even happier I got it when I did!",1474761600,,524,4.553191489361702

5083023,5,B007FSEAHY,This box set is AWESOME. Not only is it made out of high quality materials but it is actually worth paying more for it (perhaps not 1000USD). It is way beyond any blu-ray box set I own (which says a lot!),1469404800,,204,4.0
5083024,5,B007FSEAHY,If you are looking to pick this up try you local costco got it there for 150.00 love it by the way,1465689600,,98,3.5
5083025,4,B007FSEAHY,"Now let me say something beforehand,

I KNEW I would save up my money to purchase this since the very first film came out. I KNEW from day one that I wouldn't purchase a single Harry Potter film until the collection set was ready.

With that being said:

It's a beautiful layout and there are a lot of GREAT secret compartments! (I ordered it the day it came out and found one I didn't know existed just last week!)

If you do not own the movies already, this is a GREAT BUY!

But...

The digital copies? Big time scam. You have to sign up with another service and you can only watch them through THAT service online. No offline movie. That's a BIG bummer considering this is $500.",1461542400,,681,4.28125
5083026,5,B007FSEAHY,Love the product :) just wondering did anyone else receive extra copies of some of the discs ? in the bottom draw i have extra copies of the 2nd film and bonus discs from the last film in paper sleeves ?,1460764800,,203,3.975609756097561

5083034,5,B007FSEAHY,I freely acknowledge that this item is expensive.  Never-the-less I chose to buy it and am not one bit sorry.  I love having the whole collection of movies in one place and in wide screen.  The box is sturdy and fun to have along with all the 'goodies' added.  If you can afford it: buy it.

5083035,2,B007FSEAHY,"This was supposed to be new. Purschase price was new price but it wasn't new. Collector box lid was torn. Most of the disks don't work or only half way if they do. The 8 collectors DVD's work great but not this high priced whole thing ...nope!!! Shame. Warner Bros. had a good idea but let people down not just that it doesnt work, but charging an exorbitant price for something that doesnt work. There should be a class action suit againt them to make this right since its not a cheap $2 item!!!",1442102400,,496,4.287234042553192
5083036,5,B007FSEAHY,If you don't already own anything contained it this Collection then it was well worth it. However I have a feeling that most Harry Potter fans already own many of the items and this would be a duplication of some things.,1441584000,,220,4.390243902439025
5083037,5,B007FSEAHY,"Best thing I've ever got.

5083046,4,B007FSEAHY,"From the beginning,

First of all, this set is really detailed, and you wouldn't believe is made out of a cardboard, it looks sturdy and thats gonna be in family for generations, I had it shipped to Brazil and it endure it the trip. I don't know why but i really thought it should have more extras besides a lot of discs, the label collection book is amazing! and the artwork as well. But the catalog of artifacts fell short to me once it displays interesting magic memorabilia ia a poor way, once you can't barely see the itens and it doesn't hold many information, a marauders map would come more handy.
The discs are amazing, although I can't see the need for 7 dvds discs of the movies, i wold prefer more extras and interviews and most of all EXTENDED VERSIONS, than this discs i probably won't ever play.
 I like it for the price I payed (199.99) but wouldn't be happy paying more than 300. Its very nice don't get me wrong, but with more than 300 you can buy the same 31 disc and go to noble collection buy a lot of stuff from the movie that will be more worthy. Now all that is left for us muggles is to wait for the Extended versions and hope that they will come faster.",1430611200,,1179,4.212389380530974

My guess is to look for any damages. It comes in a cover that shows color pictures of the items within. It appeared only slightly torn. It wasn't until i opened it fully that i saw the large crack down the length of the box. I was devistated. I got in touch with Amazon about the issue. They helped me immediately. They helped me through email and over the phone to get my new order to me pronto. I was so impressed with how they were able to do so many things to make me feel better, even though it wasn't their vender.

A uniquely die-hard HP fanatic (like myself) may recognize many of the features from various two-disc editions released over the years, but it still had hours of stuff that I'd never even seen before, which is quite an accomplishment.

5083058,5,B007FSEAHY,"I received this set for Christmas and as an avid Harry Potter fan I have to say I'm in love.  The details and quality of the set are astounding, which explains some of the high price tag.  Because it's such an extensive set I'm going to go through it piece by piece for you:
-The Box: The case everything comes in is beautiful, so much so that it can sit on a shelf and pass as decor.  It is, however, pretty big.  It stands about a foot tall, and almost that wide/deep.  It's heavy, but nicely decorated with a lid that swings open and then arms that swing out.  Even the interior is beautiful.  It features drawers, pop out boxes and even a hidden panel.

-The Blu Rays/DVD's: This set features all 8 movies and each one comes in it's own decorated book that fits of the theme of the film.  It's not an art book, but each page features a DVD, Blu Ray, Special Edition and a creating of disc.  Each movie features the theatrical edition and the extended edition.

-Ultraviolet: The set's discs also feature Ultraviolet version to add to your computer (you get a little scroll telling you how to do it)

-Slytherin's Locket: You actually receive a replica of Slytherin's Locket in the set.  I remember thinking it'd be a cheap version, but it's the necklace the Noble Collection sells.  It's beautiful and worthy of display.

-Label Collection: This book features images of all the labels used in the films.  From potion bottles, candies, Weasley joke merchandise to the labels of Dumlbledore's memory vials all the labels are features and in beautiful, printed color.

-Original Sketches: These are slightly larger than postcards and are original concept sketches of Hogwarts, the graveyard in Goblet of Fire, Diagon Alley and Hagrid's Hut.  They're gorgeous and worth framing.

-Certificate of Authentication: It's a beautiful, 6x8 (roughly) printed certificate telling you the number of printing your set is and that it's authentic.  It almost looks like a diploma from Hogwarts, it's really well done.

-Bonus Disc: This set is hidden behind a panel and features When Harry Left Hogwarts, 50 Greatest Harry Potter Moments, Designing the World of Harry Potter, Secrets Revealed! Quidditch, Secrets Revealed! Hagrid and The Harry Potter You Never Met.  Basically specials I think aired on TV at one time or another.

-Hogwarts Blueprint: This map is so beautiful I framed it.  It's a overhead map of Hogwarts printed to look like drawings on parchment.  Each section has a small picture from the 7th movie so you know where everything is.  It also has scale and notes like a real map.  It's easily my favorite part of the set.

-Tapestry: This tapestry features all the places in Harry Potter.  It's decently large and printed on tan fabric.  It's well done, but a bit faded and a little blurry.  It could easily be framed, the quality is good enough, but it could be better.

-Harry Potter: Catalogue of Artifacts: this book is really cool. Each page is dedicated to a place or person with artifacts that go with them.  For example, Harry's page features images of his glasses, a Chocolate Frog box, images of him, a Hogwarts Express ticket and his first letter from Hogwarts.  There are pages of Death Eaters masks, Weasley Wizard Wheezes merch and items from the Quidditch World Cup.  It's really well done.

The price is high, I agree, but the quality of the item is superb.  If you're a die hard Harry Potter fan this set is for you, and I believe it's worth every penny.",1419724800,4,3478,4.708126036484246

5083081,5,B007FSEAHY,"An incredible assortment of drawers, discs and delights.  I've shown it off and people are amazed at how it opens and HP fans are extremely jealous. The only thing I wish it had was a wand... I really wish a wand was included... *sigh*.  Anyway, only a Harry Potter fan will probably purchase this so I won't go into how awesome the movies are.  Suffice it to say that if you can get your hands on one of these, you will not be disappointed.",1402012800,,441,4.226190476190476
5083082,5,B007FSEAHY,"I was so excited to get this collection! Biggest downside is that I worry I'll break it if I get the movies out too many times, but it seems study enough that it should last as long as you're somewhat careful. Definitely worth the purchase price!",1401926400,,246,4.369565217391305

5083084,5,B007FSEAHY,"I absolutely love the Wizard's Collection!  We hesitated for a moment before purchasing it because of the price, but I'm glad we decided to get it.  There are so many extras - it's full of amazing stuff.  My favorite is the tapestry - I have taken it to a few conventons & had some of the actors sign it & they have all been really impressed with it.  There are so many great things in here, a lot of secret compartments, we had fun just opening it & finding everything.  It was like a treasure hunt.  It is a very large item, it takes up a whole square in our bookshelf.
It's a must have for the die hard Harry Potter fan.",1401667200,,623,4.065573770491803
5083085,5,B007FSEAHY,"It is a beautiful set! Would love to have at least a free wand as a gift though.
But overall, digital contents wise, love it. :)",1399161600,,128,3.9615384615384617
5083086,2,B007FSEAHY,"Paid a total of $700 for this. Due to tax and shipping. The tax was supposed to be paid on delivery though instead of added to the Amazon receipt like usual, so I can only say it's not good to send as a present.

The box is torn and tattered but the inside is new. There was a sticker labelling it ""sellable"", scribbled in blue ball point ink on the sticker with the barcode. LOL Clearly secondhand. The UV digital copy couldn't be downloaded without a flixster account, which required me to be in the US. Not as advertised. The blueray can be played in my country but I would really much rather the thought of being able to watch it on my ipad. I mean, I paid ten times the price of a harry potter DVD boxset, I'd think that I could watch the digital copy anywhere in the world. Amazon is really nice about their policy though. I may have a chance at returning it.

But, I realised that I'd have to spend a few hundred dollars for shipping it back to Amazon US. Amazon says that if they realise it's not their fault, I'd have to pay for shipping. I'm not taking that risk, no thanks.

The box is like a pretty packaged mooncake box. The stuff inside you can get for much cheaper outside. I do like the sketches and the graphics though, I can frame it up and put it on the wall.

The biggest consolation I can give myself is that my mother just spent 3000 dollars on her bag. Let's just say I bought this for the Harry Potter brand instead. I'd give it a 1 star but that'd make me feel like I actually burned 700 dollar bills.",1398729600,,1526,4.14527027027027
5083087,1,B007FSEAHY,"To sum it up, RIP OFF! GIVE US the uncut versions, THATS WHAT WE WANT! WB sucks, why, do you keep trying to rip us off? To all that read this NEVER buy another harry potter DVD set till they are all uncut.",1398556800,2,205,3.7906976744186047
5083088,5,B007FSEAHY,I got this for a friend and man did she love it! I was also impressed by how good it was. So if you know any potter fans this is a great gift.,1398384000,,142,3.3333333333333335
5083089,5,B007FSEAHY,"Definitely worth the money, especially if you are interested in the additional Harry Potter items and special behind the scenes and additional scenes (at least for those films where WB has released additional scenes).",1398297600,,217,5.411764705882353
5083090,5,B007FSEAHY,"If I hadn't gotten it for $200 brand new I wouldn't own it. But if I was rich , yes ... I would.  All the bonus stuff ,which is what I wanted, and some collectibles(which I didn't need but the price didn't reflect)(?).  An awesome great looking set. FYI - It's huge - to open it you need like an entire table-top or if your tubes on the wall like mine - the majority of the top of your TV stand. literally. Opened up it will almost fill a 30""x30"" area - unless you allow the front panel that drops down like a drawbridge to hang over the edge - then you can narrow it up. I just wish they had included one of Tom Riddles diaries instead of the locket - I'm not spending $35 for blank pages. ( I started collecting the horcruxes and I have the locket.(of course I have to draw the line at the snake unfortunately and I don't want a  Harry) I'm hoping when they come up with a diadem it isn't a million bucks -",1397692800,4,908,3.978021978021978

5083095,5,B007FSEAHY,"This box set is my pride and joy! I have been obsessed with the Harry Potter series ever since the first movie came out when I was 11, which lead me into reading the books until Chamber of secrets was released. The amount of detail that went into this GIANT box set is unbelievable! The cloth map is so beautiful and I'm just so extremely grateful to be one of the few people that own this set and can actually appreciate it. I'm also excited for my daughter to grow up and have a wonderful imagination of witches and wizards!

5083096,5,B007FSEAHY,Read the books from start to finish and then watched the movies in stunning Blu-ray.  What more could I ask for?  The extras where more than expected and the amazing box was beyond words.  Show this thing off as often as I can.,1393718400,,227,4.232558139534884
5083097,4,B007FSEAHY,"I am extremely pleased with how much was included in this package. All the dvd's, blurays, etc. came with the package. There was a note about the outside container being a bit damaged, which was fine. That bit wasn't useful, so it was tossed. However, there was slight damage to the package itself. Not a big deal. It was on the bottom and isn't noticeable on display.

Overall, I am very pleased with the reaction the package got. I bought the set for my wife's birthday and she was completely shocked and pleasantly surprised to see what was hidden inside.",1393632000,,558,4.58
5083098,2,B007FSEAHY,"I had wanted this set for some time due to reading the descriptions and reviews online. After arrival I felt that it was not a good value. Many of the accessories were printed paper and not originals or tangible items other than the tapestry (which was my favorite part) and the necklace, which I found to look very cheap. The case itself was interesting with many compartments and of a nice design. The dvd's were also nicely wrapped. I bought this mainly for the additional fan gear and was disappointed. I would have preferred to pay a higher price for more useful items than fancy printed paper products. I returned this item.",1393545600,2,630,4.633928571428571

Luckily I got it for Christmas, and could not have been happier, quality of the packaging is amazing - piece of art in itself, The Noble Collection collectable included is great, the extra books, maps, etc, is really amazing, not to mention all the extra video content, I know the extended versions of the last 6 movies are not included, but I can live with that. If you're a serious HP fan - this is a must buy.",1393459200,,529,4.408163265306122
5083100,4,B007FSEAHY,"I got this for my mom from Costco for only $150ish dollars. Great price. We didn't have all the movies OR the Blu-rays so it was worth it for us. I do wish it had all the extended editions in it, but like I said, I purchased this aside from that point to fill out our personal collection. The box is amazingly put together. IT was sooo fun opening up and exploring it. Don't forget to look against the back wall for the bonus disc once you open up both wings wide. We didn't find that compartment until 2 months later. I've really enjoyed watching the entire series from start to finish on Blu-ray with my family. We're now 2 discs into the Extra making of Harry Potter stuff. I would never pay full price for this but the Costco price over Christmas made this a no brainer! They just released all the DVD's of this box in a set on Amazon for $165 or something...but this was still a better deal because you get so much extra stuff.",1393372800,,932,4.212290502793296

5083104,4,B007FSEAHY,I love all the extras that you get in this package. The box itself is awesome! My husband and I had fun finding all the hiding spots where new treasures were stored.

5083105,5,B007FSEAHY,"Though it was a little bigger and heavier then I anticipated, I still love it. I was going to get all the Ultimate Editions of each movie, but this combines them all in one and has a few other treats from the World of Harry Potter! The pictures are beautiful, the Slytherin Locket is cool and actually opens! It's also cool that it comes with a bunch of other behind the scenes segments you won't find anywhere else. Bottom line, for a Potterhead, I'd strongly recommend buying this.",1391472000,,483,4.5
5083106,5,B007FSEAHY,"Yeah, it was pricey, but it was Christmas, and my daughter-in-law is a huge Harry Potter fan. I asked my son what I could get for her, and he told me this would make her Christmas because she wanted it badly but couldn't bring herself to spend that amount of money on herself for such a non-essential.

It was well-made, well-packed, delivered quickly. I thought it was just a DVD/Blu-ray collection, but the chest had so many little compartments, some were even spring loaded, and it was FILLED with all sorts of trinkets and collectibles. She and my son sat with it for over an hour going through all the stuff in it...oh,.and she cried when she opened it. Need I say more? I have absolutely no regrets.",1390867200,,705,4.5078125

We have enjoyed the different special features present on the discs.  The packaging is extraordinary with the different compartments that open to reveal the movies or other surprises.  My daughter thought that it was especially cool to find a haucrux hidden inside.  The box is put together well and a real showcase for the movies.  For a fan, it is definitely fun to have the movies in such a neat keepsake.  My shipment arrived on time and in good condition.",1390176000,,572,4.603960396039604

5083114,5,B007FSEAHY,"This product can only be described as spectacular! A lot of reviews say you should only get this if you don't already have the movies. In my opinion it does not matter. I had every movie on Blu-Ray (not ultimate editions) and I just had to buy this. Many people say this is too pricey and in truth it is, but not if you want the Ultimate Editions. On Amazon the UE's are $60+$40+around $100 used(PoA is sold out in UE)+around $80 used(GoF is also sold out)+around $50 used(OotP is sold out)+around $50 used(HBP is sold out)+$39(DH Part 1&2)=$419. Even if you found all UE's for cheaper somewhere else, you would miss out on this great box, the cloth map of Hogwarts, the blue print of Hogwarts, the label collection, the Book of Artifacts, the locket of Salazar Slytherin, the concept art, and an exclusive bonus Blu-Ray Disc! Not to mention, if you wait and decide to buy this later, you risk the chance of it going into the thousands to buy this since it is limited and numbered (there are only 63,000 in the entire world, not just the US). If you just can't afford this, Amazon is coming out with an exclusive (including the exclusive bonus Blu-Ray) on February 25th for $169.

5083115,2,B007FSEAHY,"Purchased this set as a gift. Got it in September at a great price, and set it in the gift closet until Christmas. Christmas came, gift was opened and marveled at. We finally opened the set on January 5. We loved all of the bells and whistles (the drawers, the prints, the books, the Horcrux locket replica, etc). We proceeded to have a Harry Potter marathon. We watched movie 1 immediately. All good. Movie 2 had a weird pause about 2/3 of the way through the film. Movie 3 played fine the next day, as did Movie 4 the day after. Tonight, as we were watching movie 5, it has been pausing, skipping, and lagging multiple times throughout the movie. And of course, we are WAY out side of the return window... so we are just stuck. With a faulty product. Thanks Warner Brothers. Thanks Amazon. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! If you must buy this set - check EVERY disc immediately!!

(For the record, we have only tried the Blu-Ray versions so far, and not the DVD versions, or the special features discs. Our pleasure over the novelty of the boxed set has rapidly deteriorated after attempting to watch faulty discs with no hope of replacement.)",1389139200,,1133,4.553921568627451
5083116,4,B007FSEAHY,"I love this box set. It is extremely awesome and in keeping with the style of chests and trunks represented in the Harry Potter movies. However, mine has slight damage on the front corners of the chest and the cloth map of the school is extremely faded and blurry. I was really disappointed... however I got the set at an extremely discounted rate and see the restoration of the cloth map as a fun art project... otherwise this is one of the coolest sets I've ever seen.",1389052800,,470,4.413793103448276
5083117,5,B007FSEAHY,So far my experience with the collection was extraordinary.  It was in good condition when it arrived and no damage was found. Only thing that bothered me was that the region code did not work with my ps3. But by using a normal dvd player I was able to watch them.,1389052800,,264,4.176470588235294
5083118,5,B007FSEAHY,"It's interesting to me that so many of these reviews are from people who don't have the box set. I have it, and I love it. I have laughed and cried and received great enjoyment from the many extras.",1388793600,,198,4.102564102564102
5083119,4,B007FSEAHY,"Let me start this review by saying I was not originally a Harry Potter fan, but I married into it.  I bought this set as an anniversary present for my wife when Amazon featured it as a Gold Box deal.  At normal price, this set is a tough pill to swallow, but at Gold Box price (and even Amazon's normal price), it's worth every penny.

Unboxing:  This thing is HEAVY!  I actually have to lift it out of the shipping case and the normal WB cardboard box, as it was too heavy for my wife to comfortably lift.  Once it was out of the box, you can really feel the quality of the outside of the display box.  Yes it is cardboard-core, but it has a great feel when you run your hands over it.  The front of the box is held on by a decently powerful magnet, but folds down with little effort.  It's strong enough to keep the box from accidentally opening, but it won't keep your 80-year-old Harry-Potter-loving grandma out of it either.  I also strongly recommend opening it on a large and sturdy table, as our attempts to examine the box on the couch, then our coffee table, ultimately proved fruitless.

Inside the box are a number of items that any Harry Potter fan will recognize: the insignias of each House, a map of Hogwarts, and even a Horcrux locket.  Being modeled after the Weasley Twins' Skiving Snackbox, it's fitting that there are a number of drawers and secret compartments that hide the various trinkets and discs in the set.  Unfortunately for my wife (and this is why I removed a star), there appears to be a serious quality control issue at WB's supplier for these boxes: the sketch prints and label collection booklet were missing from the set we received.  Amazon promptly authorized an exchange, and we found the same two items missing from the same drawer in the new set.  I contacted WBShop.com (my first mistake) and was told that they wouldn't do anything because I didn't buy direct from WBShop.com.  After going around for a couple of weeks, I finally got in touch with someone very helpful at WB Home Video support, who promptly sent out the two missing items and a copy of The Great Gatsby on Blu-ray for my troubles.  That's a whole other story not relevant to this review though, so back to the unboxing!

Everything else seemed to be present and all non-disc pieces were in excellent shape.  Unfortunately, the discs were not.  The cases the discs come in are of reasonably good quality and should not result in much, if any, damage during shipping.  Despite this, 16 of our 31 discs were scratched or discolored in some way.  Since we had two box sets in our home at the time, we were able to piece together 30 discs that had little to no damage, and one disc that was pretty scratched, but played without error.  The set we ended up returning to Amazon had 31 scratched discs.  That's a pretty atrocious rate of damage for a product marketed (and priced) at this quality level.  This is reason #2 for losing the 5th star.

Despite having this set for about 3 months now, we still haven't watched all of the extra features.  That said, the features we have watched have been very entertaining.  It's true that most (if not all) of this content can be found in other Harry Potter box sets, particularly the Ultimate Editions of the years that have such editions, but when taken as a whole this set is really a great collection.  The audio and video quality of many of the special features leaves a bit to be desired, particularly when watching on an HD TV, but that seems to be the status quo for special features these days.  Hopefully this newfangled ""HD"" craze will catch on in Hollywood soon and we'll see them give the same love to the special features as they do to the feature film itself.

Speaking of the feature films, the Blu-ray discs contain the same excellent transfers as the existing Blu-rays you could buy separately.  This set also includes UltraViolet copies (which I refuse to use on principle) and DVD copies of each feature film.  I ripped the DVDs to my PC and converted them to MP4 format so that I can put them on my iPad for long flights.  Without the DVD copies of the films, I wouldn't have been able to do this, so that's a huge plus for this collection for me as well.

This collector's set is definitely one of the nicest and most complete sets I've seen for any product.  Fans of the Harry Potter franchise would be remiss to pass this set up.",1388620800,4,4402,4.45875
5083120,5,B007FSEAHY,It's just so darn cool!  Loaded with fun stuff for Harry Potter fanatics.  Tons of behind the scenes discs and extras.,1388534400,,118,4.571428571428571
5083121,5,B007FSEAHY,I was pleasantly surprised by the incredible quality. This item was even better than I hoped. Great for any avid Harry Potter fan!,1388361600,,130,4.695652173913044
5083122,5,B007FSEAHY,The fan loved it and everything that is listed is in the box. Box sets get a special place in the home theater room.,1388361600,,116,3.875
5083123,5,B007FSEAHY,"The look and amazement on my daughter and son in laws face for CHRISTMAS was WONDERFUL!!! She has wanted this for years! And she was almost in tears, so even tho it was a little expensive to me, it was worth it to have brought so much joy to my children!
GOD BLESS EVERYONE THERE AND
HAPPY NEW YEAR",1388275200,,298,4.067796610169491
5083124,5,B007FSEAHY,Absolutely amazing! My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan and she was so happy with this! The company shipped it to me fast and it was in great shape!,1388188800,,147,3.933333333333333
5083125,5,B007FSEAHY,"I woke up Christmas morning, and there was a big wrapped package by the tree. I say by the tree because it wouldn't fit under it. Thinking it was a pod coffee maker, (because of the weight of it) which I had asked for, I unwrapped my present. I had asked my husband for this a few years ago, and completely given up hope on getting it when he said that when first released it was too expensive. So when I took it out of the wrapping paper, and the box, I ABOUT DIED!!! And I hadn't even seen the quality of the box set yet! Once I got the box set out of the packaging, I was awe-struck once I began examining it. Any TRUE Harry Potter fan will feel it was shipped straight from Hogwarts! As I told my husband, it was the next best thing to being there! It all begins with a hinged-HINGED lid on top. Once you pull that up, it has a cover that protects the front of it that comes down. And then the magic begins! There are drawers with actual handles on the front of them. Each movie collection comes in what looks like a book, with side binding and all. Then the extra bonus disc is hidden in inside back of the box. Then the are two drawers that have a ""click lock"" on them with the Slythrerin necklace horcrux in one, and a small scroll with your ultraviolet code in the other. Then in one drawer are sketches and a label book. In the other drawer, your letter of authenticity. Then in a secret compartment behind the top dvds, there is an artifact book, a tapestry of Hogwarts, and a map of hogwarts with reference numbers of when the spots were revealed in the movies!! I was amazed! I only have two complaints but they have nothing to do with quality or beauty of this amazing box set or of the Warner Bros company, as they are not the fault of either. First, part 1 of the ""Wizarding World Of Harry Potter"" at the end of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was not there. Second, there was a gouge on the side of the box set. So use some caution on what seller you buy it from. But, my husband talked with the company and they sent one out that I received the next day in perfect condition. But this is BY FAR the BEST box set I have ever, or will ever own...I am SURE of it! The packaging and quality are amazing. The extras...amazing. If true potter fans want to wait a bit longer to see if it comes down in price anymore, that is fine. But any TRUE potter fan simply has to own this! If I could, I would own two, and keep the other one in the packaging, because this WILL be worth a lot of money one day. Anyone who is not a Potter fan may want to buy one of these beauties for just that reason! It is gorgeous! I will have this treasure for the rest of my life!!!",1388188800,,2656,4.070610687022901
5083126,5,B007FSEAHY,She absolutely loved it! For her it was like unwrapping multiple presents as she explored it. She is 22 and her face lit up like a little kid as she fully opened the box. This truly the ultimate DVD collection for a fan.,1388016000,,220,4.1395348837209305
5083127,5,B007FSEAHY,"A lot of the lower star reviews I looked at said that there were pieces missing. This is false. There are secret compartments all over the collections box. For intense the Bonus disk is one of the main things people could not find, its hidden exceptionally well! Whenever you open the box the disk is hidden in the back feel around and you will feel a tab and its there! I think its quite fun to find these things! But, if you did not know where to look it would be very easy to think they were not put in the box. The DvDs work great but I feel that the only bad thing about this collection is that just about all the movies except seven are BlueRay so I cant watch 24 of the seven DvDs. But even if you do not have a BlueRay player this collection is still amazing!",1388016000,3,767,4.052631578947368
5083128,5,B007FSEAHY,"A while ago, I wrote off this set as a pipe dream. I once saw it discounted for 250 but that was still way out of my price range, especially considering the negative reviews and the fact that the box was referred to as cheap cardboard. I adore Harry Potter, but a lot of the official merchandise is just too expensive for me. But today I received this box set as a gift. I nearly cried when I realized what it was.

This is beautiful. I spent nearly an hour taking everything out, looking at it and reading.

The box is some kind of cardboard, I believe. But it's thick and sturdy, and I can't see anything happening to it unless someone is rough with it. (I got the box set of the books that come in the cardboard trunk a while back and was very disappointed by the quality of the trunk. I was worried this would be similar, but it's not.) There are magnets to help things stay closed. There are two small drawers that pop open when you pull open the sides and they actually click in and out of place. All the surfaces are decorated (including the insides of the drawers, even). For five hundred dollars, I would expect this to be made out of wood. But this set can be found for less than half the price, sometimes even under two hundred dollars. At that price point, this box is exquisite.

I understand that this is technically considered a movie box set, but I viewed it as a general collector's set. So some are angry that this set doesn't include all the extended editions and new material, but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. I'm also not interested in a digital copy, so the issues with that are irrelevant to me also. For me, the best part of this set is the presentation and the ""extras"" like the sketches, maps and books.

Each movie is its own little book of sorts, with four discs, and again, the presentation of these is lovely. This set includes artwork that I can't wait to frame and put up on my walls (prints of both sketches and color paintings), a large cloth map (also perfect for the wall), and lots of detailed goodies like a book of labels used throughout the movies and pictures of props. It also has Slytherin's locket, which looks really nice, but is also sturdy enough to wear and opens like a regular locket.

Honestly, if you are just looking for a nice set of the movies, don't buy this. Other sets are much cheaper and more practical. But if you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan (or happen to be buying for one), this is a fantastic set. (I believe some of the items here can be purchased on their own, like the locket, but I think most is exclusive to this set.) This is not something to be tucked away in a closet; this is something to be displayed. It's big and very heavy. This set would be nice for a casual fan, but I think it's only people with a special love for the series that would fully appreciate this and be okay with spending a couple hundred dollars for it. And, again, try to view this as a general collector's item, not a movie set. For the right person, this set is perfect. But I can see how it's not what some people were expecting, and I think that's why it appears to be such a hit or miss item.",1387929600,2,3158,4.256666666666667
5083129,5,B007FSEAHY,"This set is wonderful! It is magical and stunning and packaging was great by the way. The chest and everything inside was in pristine condition and the cases in witch the DVDs came were pretty cool. They came in a book like case that brings; a copy of the movie on Blu-Ray, a copy of the movie on DVD, the special features wich includes things like; a tour of Diagon Alley, a tour of Hogwarts, potion making classes, and much more! Every movie also comes with a disc called ""the making of Harry Potter""(parts 1-8). In this they show how they built almost everything that you see in the world of Harry potter. This set also brings some hidden collectibles like; a little scroll containing all of the downloadable codes for the ultraviolet copies of the movies, the Horcrox locket from the movies, in the top of the set there's a little flap that you can open an it includes: The Catilouge of Artifacts, a cloth map of Hogwarts, and a blueprint map of the Hogwarts Castle. There's also a little string in the middle back of the set that if you pull it comes out and if you turn it over it'll be a bonus disc. The outside and inside of the chest also have some stunning designs of the Hogwarts symbol, the four houses at Hogwarts, and on top of the chest there's an HP symbol(Harry Potter) with a golden snitch flying around it. So as you can see this set brings a hole lot to see and entertain yourself and your kids with. I'd recommend this to any body who's a big Harry Potter fan and has the space to put away this big and hefty set.",1387584000,,1534,4.293103448275862
5083130,5,B007FSEAHY,This is an amazing collection of Harry Potter DVD's.  What makes them so special is the beautiful and clever way in which the are displayed. Beautiful artwork on everything! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,1387584000,,224,6.466666666666667
5083131,4,B007FSEAHY,This thing is massive...had no idea how large it was until I received it.  It's a definite must for any huge Harry Potter fan.  All the films are great and this has the extended versions of the first two films and includes all the bonus features as well as ones made just for this set.  Throw in all the extras and it's simply amazing.,1387238400,,335,4.203125
5083132,5,B007FSEAHY,Love this  ultimate box set.  It is my pride possesion in my Harry Potter collectables.  This is so cool! A must have for all HP fans.,1386633600,,134,4.076923076923077
5083133,5,B007FSEAHY,It's an amazing collection!!! I'm really happy that I got this. An early Christmas gift to myself yey!! Love it!,1386288000,,112,4.65
5083134,5,B007FSEAHY,"My wife loves this box set.  Between the hidden compartments and the bits and pieces included, it is a great buy, if you have the disposable income.",1386201600,,148,4.481481481481482
5083135,5,B007FSEAHY,"Shut the front door. This is super cool and we love it.  I know we will treasure it forever.  It is big, so its hard to find a place for it, but really, its Harry Potter, it can go anywhere right?",1386201600,,196,3.7560975609756095
5083136,2,B007FSEAHY,"Open box item with manufacturing defects on discs sold as new. Shame on everyone involved, but at least Amazon was very good about taking it back for a refund. Otherwise it would have been a great item to own and enjoy.",1386028800,,219,4.365853658536586

5083138,5,B007FSEAHY,"The presentation is amazing!  I absolutely love it.  I got it on sale, which made the price more bearable, but I really like it and it has everything I need to enjoy the Harry Potter experience.",1385596800,,194,4.361111111111111
5083139,1,B007FSEAHY,"If you think that almost US$300 it's expensive, just think about how much this costs in Brazil: ~only~ almost US$1000, in real (our money), R$2000. We're all being robbed.",1385510400,,171,4.931034482758621
5083140,4,B007FSEAHY,"Its not perfect, but it is everything I wanted. I know people who own the movies would be upset buying this since it doesn't provide a whole lot extra. But I on the other hand waited the 9 years or so for this collection and hadn't owned any of the potter films before but enjoyed them in theaters. I can speak for the quality of the box, it is very well constructed and sturdy. Surely something that will stand the test of time.",1385424000,,429,4.180722891566265
5083141,1,B007FSEAHY,"I've been waiting to buy any of the Harry Potter movies until they all came out in a set. I want them on blu-ray and DVD, and I have no interest in anything ultraviolet. Finally they release a set in blu-ray but they are not all extended editions or even have any more extra's then the original releases. Finally a box set came out, and its a complete disappointment. No extended editions past movie 2, no non-released before extras, and crappy ""special collectibles"". They have it at my local Costco for 149.99. I can't believe anyone would spend $500 on this. You know who does that? Someone's rich grandparent who doesnt know anything about Harry potter and thinks this waste of the title ""wizard's collection"" is a good thing. Still waiting for a box set for a true HP fan, where or where is it WB???",1385337600,,804,4.513698630136986
5083142,5,B007FSEAHY,"This collection is absolutely amazing!  I already have many versions of all HP movies, but had never seen the extended versions (!).
The extras were neat too and make for a fantastic display item.  The architecture of the box is really intricate.
I don't know if the price warrants another purchase of the movies, but if you see this as a 'must have' (I did), it is pretty neat item.",1384992000,,383,4.457142857142857
5083143,5,B007FSEAHY,"My prized possession.  I LOVE THIS THING.  The locket that comes with it, is one of my favorite pieces to wear around.",1384992000,,118,4.318181818181818
5083144,5,B007FSEAHY,"I was lucky enough to purchase this while it was on sale, I believe I bought it for around 200 bucks? At that price it is worth it! the items that it has are amazing for any harry potter fan. The secret compartments are incredible it took me 2 days after i opened it to realize that i still had one compartment that i hadn't checked. The art work is beautiful, i can't wait to buy frames for them to show them off in my room. I would however advise that it would be best to buy it when it's on sale OR if you do have the money to spend on it full price. Again GREAT item for any true harry potter fan. You will appreciate it.",1384905600,,625,3.890625
5083145,3,B007FSEAHY,"The set is really great.  The box itself looks awesome, and the drawers and compartments all work wonderfully.  The movies and bonus video material offer hours of viewing.  Probably the best part of the whole set is the art that is included.  The blueprint sketch, the postcards, and the full color renderings are really well done and easily nice enough to hang on the wall.

Unfortunately, one of the coolest pieces, a large, color, cloth tapestry of the Hogwarts grounds, is basically garbage in the box that I got.  It looks nothing like the pictures in the product description nor does it look like pictures posted around the web by other folks who have bought the set.  Mine is extremely faded, and none of the lines are sharp.  You can't read hardly any of the words on the map because the lines are not clear.  You can see excellent photos of the map on any number of blogs around the net, including a WIRED unboxing.  They all look pretty much like the photos on the product page.  Mine looks like it's been through a washing machine a few dozen times.  Obviously, not every set has this problem, but you'd think for a limited edition set with an MSRP of $500, NONE of them would have this problem.

I contacted Amazon, but they are sold out of the set and only have it through third-party sellers now.  I suppose the fortunate thing is that I got this when it was a gold box deal for about $150, but even at that heavily discounted price, I would expect the product to be better quality controlled.

The set as a whole is awesome and easily would have gotten five stars from me.  However, the cloth map was something I was really looking forward to, and it just failed to meet my (completely reasonable) expectations in just about every way.  If I had paid $500 or even the current $260+ for it, I would have given it two or possibly one star.",1383955200,,1852,4.431952662721893
5083146,4,B007FSEAHY,"I absolutely loved the wizard collection. Opening all the hidden compartments and all the exclusive content. Until I opened one of the drawers and found it completely empty. My set is missing one of the books and the idea sketches. I also want to express my anger with Amazon themselves for NOT RESPONDING TO MY COMPLAINT!!! The DAY I received it and discovered the missing pieces i sent them a complaint and they have yet to respond to me! I received it in late July and I'm writing this review NOVEMBER 7TH!!!!

But all in all the set was worth it, especially at the sale price I purchased it for.",1383782400,,599,4.445454545454545

But this is really a cool comparative box set that complements the movies as much as the movies themselves, i would buy this as a gift for any harry potter fan, they will just love whats inside.",1383350400,,363,3.8533333333333335
5083148,5,B007FSEAHY,This box collection is one very big box filled with amazing things.  Glad I purchased this box set. Very solid and well done.,1383091200,,125,4.434782608695652

5083150,5,B007FSEAHY,"I love it! It's a must have for any Harry Potter fan. It is expensive though, but it is nearly $200 dollars cheaper if you buy it from Amazon.com.

I never would have purchased at the MSRP, but when this came on as the deal of the day for only $150, with free Prime delivery, I couldn't resist!!  How can people review something they haven't purchased?  These reviews are the ones to ignore.  It's a opinion based on nothing.  The box is amazingly sturdy, and fun, the discs are all in great condition, and all the little extras make it so much fun!  I love that it's a limited number - while that number has not yet been reached, it's still nice to have something that is in limited edition!",1382572800,,593,4.345454545454546

This set is amazing - I am an adult and am filled with childlike wonderment whenever I open this box. Full disclaimer, I only paid $209 for this set  because of some freakish and amazing sale. I do think I'd still be utterly pleased if I'd paid the full price though.

It's a beautiful boxed set, with all of the essentials and so many wonderful hidden trinkets, sketches, and prints ... I just love it.",1382400000,2,546,4.505050505050505
5083153,5,B007FSEAHY,Amazing. I framed the scene paintings and hung them up in my cinema room. They are extremely well done. The detail this collection has is awesome. I have never seen a box set put together like this one. Yes I watch and love the blue rays and all the bonus features  but the box and its extra surprises have helped me add a Harry Potter touch to the decor in my favorite place to watch movies.,1381795200,,392,4.157894736842105
5083154,1,B007FSEAHY,I am very disapointed with your product and service. You did not mention in the description of the item that the DVDs are only in english and spanish. I am French and DVDs are usless to me if I can not understand the language. I would like to return the DVDs for a refund but the shipping cost is 109.00 which is more than half the price I paid for the DVDs. Can you please help and try to find a more reasonable solution so I can get my money back and you can have your merchandise back without me having to pay such an overtly expensive shipping fee.,1381795200,,552,4.073394495412844

5083162,5,B007FSEAHY,This set was a major excitement when it arrived at the house. It was so fun to open and explore. There are so many drawers and hidden compartments that it takes over an hour to open them all and look at everything. Two of the hidden spots are pretty obvious. One was a little harder and one has probly been missed by the majority of the people who bought it. It's packaging/construction is quality is good enough that with care we will be passing this on to our kids and grand kids. It's not bulletproof but is very substantial. So many extras inside.,1381536000,,551,4.359223300970874

5083164,5,B007FSEAHY,This is an excellent collection! Very good quality and everything was just wonderful. Highly recommended. If I could change one thing I would suggest the time turner necklace instead of Voldemort's  locket but it is all very cool!,1381536000,,230,5.052631578947368

5083167,5,B007FSEAHY,So glad I saw this as Gold Box Deal. Heavy as all get out. Beautiful design. Will last through lots of use and thrill for generations. Great to share the Harry Potter Adventure with family and friends. So much content in this package.,1381536000,,234,4.465116279069767
5083168,5,B007FSEAHY,"I'd read how heavy the set was before I ordered it ... but it was still heavier than I expected.  It's almost too heavy for me to carry.

Exploring thru all the drawers and hidden places was like Christmas morning ... so much fun.  I nearly didn't find the maps though ... and was beginning to wonder if my box was missing those items ... when I finally discovered the hidden compartment they were.

Totally worth the $155 I paid for it!",1381536000,,437,4.2926829268292686

5083170,5,B007FSEAHY,"After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but the price was so good that I gave it a chance. Not sure i could have purchased the eight movies in blu ray for what I paid! I bought it as a birthday present for my 12 year old daughter. It is amazing, well built and has lots of nooks and crannies to investigate. She has a lot of Potter memorabilia but this collection had pieces she did not have. She loved the magic trunk set up and while we already have all of the movies, this is a complete set of DVD , blu ray and streaming. Even has 3D version of last movies. The box was not flimsy as mentioned in another review, although if I had paid full price, I would have expected more. It was an excellent gift at a steal of a price and I would buy it again...for me!",1381536000,,772,3.9870967741935486

5083175,5,B007FSEAHY,I bought this went it was on the Gold Box offer for $154.00.  If you are a Harry Potter fan this is a must thing to have...not only for the movie factor but as a great collectible!!!,1381536000,,182,3.918918918918919
5083176,3,B007FSEAHY,"This set is really cool. As a major Potter fan I love it but I feel WB is with holding stuff. As the ultimate collection marketed at $500, it should include everything. You get all the movies in awesome artwork printed booklets, 2 maps a book with pictures of labels and a movie prop locket. They only released the extended editions of 1-2 but not the rest. This makes the collection feel incomplete. And while the trunk it comes in is very neat and elaborate, the contents seems a bit shallow for the price. It would totally be worth it if they had real unreleased stuff like all extended versions and an extra goody or two. And they still haven't digitally fixed Lily's eyes in the last movie, which they can do at any time. For an ultimate movie collection I want every scene, because there are some they filmed that they didn't release ( like Krum showing up in DH1) and several others. It's just lame for what it's advertised as.",1381536000,,934,4.436046511627907
5083177,5,B007FSEAHY,"This is a great item for any HP fan. I do wish there were more extras included for all the films, but make no mistake...this is a wonderful set. The presentation is perfectly Harry Potter. The box - while it is cardboard - is really, really good quality. The entire thing is so heavy I was shocked to find it cardboard.

While I'm glad I didn't pay the full retail price for the set, I'm not at all disappointed in what it contained. It's a great item that will be enjoyed for years to come.",1381536000,,491,4.168421052631579

5083181,5,B007FSEAHY,"I bought this while it was on sale, which was perfect. I only owned 2 of the DVDs separately from this collection so it worked out well for me. It might not be anything new for some, but now I own all the movies in really pretty packaging, with a few extra goodies thrown in. I recommend buying this if you don't already own most of the DVDs, and whenever it goes on sale again.",1381363200,,378,4.053333333333334
5083182,5,B007FSEAHY,"Well, it was waaaay too expensive, but I bought it for my wife anyways. Harry Potter is her number 1 franchise and we didn't own any of the movies, so I thought this would be perfect for her birthday. This is definitely the most extreme and well put together collectors edition of anything I have ever bought before or will probably ever buy again. I can't give it any less than five stars simply for what it is and the thought that went into the packaging and presentation.",1381104000,,474,4.3977272727272725

5083184,5,B007FSEAHY,"I debated on purchasing this set because it is extremely expensive, but I am so happy with it. It has everything you could possibly want. Every DVD, Blue ray, 3d blue ray, special feature you could possibly want. The 8 part documentary is amazing and insightful. The extra maps, pictures, etc. are nice but not the selling point. Every dedicated Harry Potter fan must have this!",1380844800,,378,4.742424242424242

I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews.  This set is seriously mind blowing.  The quality of the materials for the set is very sturdy, the intricate compartments are so cool, and the additions besides the discs are awesome and really enhance the set!  I cannot wait to make my way through all of the discs and experience Harry Potter all over again.  I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this set.

5083190,4,B007FSEAHY,"This new limited and numbered 31-disc (17 BD, 2 BD3D, 12 DVD) collection contains all eight Harry Potter movies on Blu-ray, DVD and UltraViolet Digital Copy and more than 37 hours of special features including all previously released materials and more than 10 hours of material unique to this collection. In addition to the theatrical release of every film, the collection also includes the extended versions of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets; and the 3D versions of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2. The UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a copy but requires an Internet connection to watch the films through digital streaming. The digital copy code included with this product will expire on September 07, 2014. This is the last date that the digital code can be used to obtain a digital download.

The 8 films included: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)

Special Features: All previous content, Extended Edition of Hogwart's Last Stand, Designing the World of Harry Potter, The Harry Potters You Never Met, When Harry Left Hogwarts: Extended Version, 50 Greatest Harry Potter Moments: Definitive Version, Secrets Revealed! Quidditch, Secrets Revealed! Hagrid, Creating the World of Harry Potter, A Conversation with J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe: Extended Version (with 15 additional minutes)

[Comparison: Harry Potter Complete Collection on Blu-ray Rates 2 Stars] This is a 11-disc, 8-film set that bundles the stand-alone BDs and some of the bonus features. Note that these films are not the special editions. There are some special features but this collection is not overflowing with supplements. There's no bonus discs for the first five movies (only the last three). To add insult to injury, the first three movies have only trailers. There is also a deluxe 31-disc Harry Potter Wizard's Collection (Blu-ray / DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy) but that set isn't perfect either because it contains some of the director's cuts but not all. You are better off buying the stand-alone Blu-rays (financially and in terms of bonus supplements) until a deluxe collection with extended versions of all the films is eventually released. This set has fluctuated in price from $70 to $115 when all eight films can be purchased separately on BD for $65 (with hours of extras not included here).

Buy the Wizard's Collection. It is listed at $500, sells for $300 on Amazon but it is likely worth $250 until a new collection comes out. Amazon reviewers rate it a lowly 3 stars because extended versions for all the films are not included. A deluxe collection with director's cuts may be released in the future. If you don't own the films this is a worthwhile addition to your library. Admittedly, this is one of the most expensive Blu-ray collections for sale on Amazon! There are 50-film collections that are less expensive. You can buy the stand-alone BDs individually if you aren't interested in bonus content for much less money. This collection is probably 8 discs too large because you get a DVD copy of each film's theatrical release.",1379894400,,3466,5.033101045296167
5083191,5,B007FSEAHY,"this set had so much more than any other collection out there. It weighs almost 15 pounds, and it has so many hidden compartments.

5083192,1,B007FSEAHY,"I bought this set for my daughters' 11th birthday, who is a Harry Potter fanatic.  I was so looking forward to seeing the look on her face as she realized she got all of the movies, as well as numerous ""extras""!  Our excitement quickly turned to disappointment as we realized that we received a defective set that is missing almost all the cool extra stuff -- no Horcrux locket, or Hogwarts map, or Blueprint poster, or Catalogue of Artifacts.  We haven't tried to play any of the movies yet, so I'm unsure if they are defective as well, but it was such a let down to see her eagerly searching for all the ""extras"", that were not ultimately there. The wonderful birthday celebration ended on such a downer note, and I'm dreading the hassle of calling in the morning and trying to get a replacement set.  For the price we paid, I certainly expected the set to include every single item that is enumerated on the box.  Massive disappointment.  Buyer beware, I guess.  :(",1379808000,,968,4.528735632183908
5083193,3,B007FSEAHY,"Nothing was damaged, but 3 items that were meant to be inside are missing. They are small things, but disappointing. 1 the catalog of artefacts, 2 the blueprint poster of Hogwarts, and 3 the map of Hogwarts and surrounding area.

5083194,4,B007FSEAHY,"This boxset is the best thing that has ever happened to me - entretainment wise. Solid construction, quality materials and all the other fancy & nice things everyone has told you about this set is AB-SO-LU-TE-LY true.

Just a tiny issue... the Special Features DVD's that are included are not multi-region (mexican fan here), and that really sucks because it means that you might have problems finding a device that plays multi-region DVD's (a PC is fine, but I wanted to watch them in my PS3 and it didn't let me ). Same thing with the UltraViolet copy... the website doesn't let me collect my digital copy because my country (Mexico) is not listed in the site.

There must be a way arroud that UltraViolet thing, but other than the incompatibility with my DVD region, this thing is the most precious thing I have ever purchased.",1379548800,,830,4.678082191780822
5083195,5,B007FSEAHY,"This set is just beautiful. I love all the movie options. So many people are complaining that they aren't actually getting anything extra, seriously, is that the ONLY reason this product attracted you? I'm sure you clicked on the link when browsing HP Blu-ray and said ""eh, that looks like crap. Moving on"". Guess what, those that ACTUALLY said that, did that. I personally love everything included in this set. I'd love a bit more for the price (it's currently cheaper on the WBshop.com) but maybe in the future, when looking for new reasons to get people to buy HP movies, they'll look into what would be more enticing. A wand maybe? Just saying....",1379462400,,651,4.719298245614035
5083196,5,B007FSEAHY,"bought this before i saw any of the reviews because i got it during the Gold Box deal for $155. wasted no time in ordering and i'm SO GLAD that i did. when u do get this, u will quickly understand why they charge what they charge. the packaging design is INCREDIBLE with amazing attention to detail! materials used is not flimsy cardboard like others THINK it is. i wouldn't recommend leaving it out in the rain or sitting on it, but it's quite sturdy. (plus, don't leave it out in the rain. u just have to know better.) it's big, it's heavy, it's got lots of tiny compartments, every movie has it's own little ""book"" - just an awesome collection.
having said that, i don't know if i would pay the full $350 for this. (and definitely not $500!)  B U T  i would have a hard time parting with my hard-earned $350 for most things. i don't even pay that much for my smartphone. for the $155 though, i feel i got an amazing steal. this will be a great collection to have forever. or at least until bluray and dvd players become completely obsolete.
i think a 1 star rating seems unfair coming from those that haven't even purchased this yet. if all u want are those extended versions that don't come with this set, i would say u should STILL get this set and wait for those extended versions later. u'll miss out on something truly incredible. (but wait till it goes on Gold Box deal cuz $350 - my goodness!)",1379376000,,1403,4.290566037735849
5083197,5,B007FSEAHY,This was quite a surprise. Very heavy and substantial. I still haven't been able to watch the extra DVD footage. Winter is on the way. I look forward to watching them. It is packaged very well.,1379376000,,193,4.388888888888889

5083199,5,B007FSEAHY,"When I picked up the box sitting outside my door I was surprised by how much it weighs. The quality of the case and artifacts inside are very nice.

As I opened it up, I seriously felt all giddy inside like a very small child. Secondly, this thing is GINORMOUS. Like a troll. In the dungeon. Lastly, every single person who even remotely enjoys Harry Potter should order this box set. I realize that it comes attached with a very hefty fee, but let us be honest, what else better do you have to spend almost $400 on?",1379289600,,475,4.348314606741573

5083202,3,B007FSEAHY,"This set is massive and is simply amazing with all it includes, but there are some serious quality control issues with it, that are WB's fault. The case holding my Deathly Hallows Part II discs was completely in Spanish and as others have stated, several of the discs have freezing or glitching issues. Make sure to look over everything thoroughly when you receive your set. Amazon ended up getting me a replacement, but after checking all of the discs, FOUR of the Blu-Rays have freezing issues during playback that make them nearly unwatchable. I really wish WB would answer my emails so I could try and get some replacement discs but so far I've had no reply.",1379203200,2,662,4.666666666666667

5083204,5,B007FSEAHY,"Such a deal, thanks to Amazon's Gold Box offer. It's bigger than our dog, a Pomeranian and smaller than our daughter, a 5 year old.

Bought it as a gift for the wife and she loves it. It comes with all 8 films on Blu-Ray, DVD and all the special/extra features you could ever want. The box is made of some kind of solid cardboard/plywood. Feels like an IKEA nightstand. The films and all the goodies are stored wonderfully. It's a joy every time you go to take something out.

Disregard the reviews from non-verified purchasers, they don't count as they haven't bought it here - so why review? Would I have paid full price? No. I am however very pleased with the price I did pay and the value I received for that...",1379116800,,715,4.3283582089552235
5083205,5,B007FSEAHY,"I told my mom years ago that no matter how much I wanted to own the Harry Potter movies right then that I really wanted to wait until the last film to see if there would be a box set. When I heard about this Wizard's Collection I knew that this was what I was waiting for. I've had this page bookmarked for the last year waiting to be able to afford it. When it went on sale the other day for $155 I knew my wait was over. It was delivered today and I was on the verge of happy tears. As a huge Harry Potter fan without access to the movies it was such a treat to FINALLY own them. As I opened the outer box I got the urge to hug this huge thing, which I did hug it, many times. It's so beautiful and sturdy! I've already looked at everything multiple times and can't get enough of it.

I was prepared to save up to pay full price and after looking over everything I stand by that decision. If you are a true HP fan and don't own the movies I say go for it!

So far I've only watched The Sorcerer's Stone (Blu-ray) but plan on going through it all to make sure it works properly. I've read some reviews that say some discs skip and whatnot but so far so good.

Also, pertaining to previous reviews, I found it super easy for the download of digital copies.",1379030400,5,1256,3.9565217391304346
5083206,4,B007FSEAHY,"Contrary to a previous reviewer's statement, you can download the films on an IPad through the ultraviolet account.  I had no trouble getting the account and the download was easy, although it took some time.

I have been looking at this set for a long time and couldn't resist when it went on sale for $155.  It just arrived and is a great set for the collector at this price.",1379030400,,377,4.357142857142857

This is the ultimate collectors piece! I however did not and would not pay $500. I was fortunate enough to purchase it at a huge discount through amazon. My advice if you want this wonderful item is to have patience and wait for it to be on sale, and I mean a GREAT sale.",1379030400,,427,4.35
5083208,5,B007FSEAHY,"Seriously one of the best days of my life when I got this box set! All those who gave this a 1 star ratings were rating on mere speculation without actually having the pleasure of owning one or seeing one in person!

As everyone has stated, the quality of the materials on EVERYTHING is amazing. The detail throughout is  beautifully done, and no surface was left untouched. And it's HUGE! The only semi-negative thing about it is trying to find a place to put it, if you don't have the room to display it.

I've been holding off on purchasing the Ultimate Editions because I knew they would release a complete box set sooner or later, and here it is. The $500 is quite pricey, and I'm not sure I would have ever paid full price for it, but my patience paid off when it went on as the deal of the day for $155, no brainer! That about $20 a movie in both bluray/dvd format, and 3D for year 7 with the awesome presentation and goodies as a bonus! Totally worth it!

5083209,1,B007FSEAHY,"Going back, first movie defective... got to the first 3D movie it was scratched and skipped too. I never even checked the DVDs they were probably all scratched up too. Never buying Gold Box again. This was clearly a repackaged return made to look new if you ask me. The extras and collectible nature is great and i almost kept it, but if you can't even watch the movies in HD then what's the point? I got it for $150 but I don't care enough for the extras... I'll never wear the necklace, and the prints are about the only great thing, not worth $100 more for extra junk. I bought the first movie just to make up for the defective one in this collection, but now I'll probably return that when it arrive too. I'm turned off to Harry Potter now and Amazon sales.

This collection would be great if it worked. At about $150 standard it's worth it, otherwise it's a waste and when you can't even watch the movies... it's worthless to me.",1378944000,,934,4.306818181818182
5083210,5,B007FSEAHY,"Wow, what a collection!  I consider myself a humongous HP fan and having been to the HP Studio Tour in the UK this past summer, seeing all the goodies this collection had in store certainly brought back those wonderful and familiar memories.  This box set has a lot of things that unless you went to the UK to see it in the studio tour, you wouldn't ever see it at all, particularly in the States.  The ""Artefacts"" book is great for that end, along with the sketches, lithograph prints, and labels book.  The box arrived in perfect condition and the discs were not scratched as some users have noted, although, it'll take a while for me to view them all to verify they are in playable condition.  To bolster what some recent users have said, this really is no cheap construction job.  The case has metal hinges and drawer knobs that look pretty darn keen.

A lot of other people have noted the details, so I won't go on too much longer.  One thing I will note is that having this collection almost necessitates one to buy a Blu-Ray player.  Aside from the theatrical release films, all the other discs (including the bonus) are Blu-Ray.  Just a note.

I was fortunate enough to get it while it was on super-sale, because while I am a big fan, $500 is too rich for my blood.  That being said, purchasing this set has brought me a great deal of joy and it is now sitting as a wonderfully enormous addition to my DVD shelf.  Waiting for the right deal really worked out in my favor, but I guess I will have to buy a Blu-Ray player now (!).",1378944000,5,1536,4.328671328671328
5083211,5,B007FSEAHY,"If I had bought this set at the original price and not at the sale price Amazon had it listed for a couple days ago, then I would probably be complaining like the rest of these reviewers. But, I think $160 is a reasonable price to pay for everything you get with this set, which, contrary to what many reviewers have said, is not ""cheap cardboard."" No the box that holds this set isn't made of wood, but if it was, it would be near impossible to lift- this is a substantial set! Perhaps my review is a little biased as I waited to buy all of the movies (which was not easy, let me tell you! I consider myself to be a pretty die-hard fan!) knowing that eventually we'd get some sort of amazing box set. Well, this one arrived and all of the negative reviews, combined with the price kept me from buying it. I am glad I held off and got a pretty considerable discount, but I also think it's important to note that this set is pretty darn brilliant and not nearly as terrible as many reviewers would have you believe.",1378944000,,1014,4.205128205128205
5083212,5,B007FSEAHY,"I recommend this to all Harry Potter fans. I was worried reading some of the reviews but when I got it, I was like a kid at Christmas time I was so excited. Trust me it is worth every penny.",1378771200,2,190,3.775
5083213,1,B007FSEAHY,"SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!  Such an epic fail.
1. Only 2 movies have extended editions.
2. More importantly, you have misrepresented the Digital Editions. You cannot watch the ""digital editions"" without being online. They are ""streaming"" movies, similar to Netflix. You cannot download them to your iPad.  That's terrible decision making and it is certainly NOT a digital edition of the movie in the most common way everyone thinks of this term.
3. I see that it's marked down to $159 today. I hope you guys learned your lesson and have to eat it on this set.
4. No one wants the DVD's in a Bluray/Digital Edition. It's almost 2014. Not 2004.  When I say ""no one"", I mean probably 95% of viewers. If you don't have a bluray player by this point, you're probably not going to invest in a $300 movie box set. Your VCR tapes are suiting you just fine.",1378771200,4,841,4.519736842105263

I personally decided to order the set based on this review and the fact that I have the bare bones 1-8 set.  Not sure if it'll let me post a link so I'm going to leave off the www and (dot)com.  Blu-ray(dot)com is a great site too btw.  The best part is the price tracker that let's you see the pricing history and lets you set your own alert price.  I've saved hundreds of dollars using it. The site also has an app that interfaces with the site that keeps your blu-ray collection handy and gives you price tracking alerts.  Anyway, here's the link...

5083216,5,B007FSEAHY,"I've seen about all box-sets there are of Harry Potter, but this is definately the one every real fan should have. Therefore I really don't get people complaining about it. The box alone is already worth every penny! Great packaging in very good quality, nice booklets, artwork and beautiful memorabilia. And on the discs itself is about every footage available concerning the movies and the production of the movies. Litterally dozens of hours of fun. I've paid full price for the box when it was just released and still enjoy it every day. The only thing I find a little bit dissapointing is that it was said to be a limited, exclusive edition. And now, months later it's still widely available for a lot less money. That takes away the exclusive feeling that they pretended it'd have when releasing the box. But other then that the best buy ever within my film collection!",1378771200,4,875,4.7254901960784315

5083218,5,B007FSEAHY,"Although, as many reviewers have pointed out, you do not get extended editions of any of the later films, this is the most complete packaging of the series available. You get all of the available behind the scenes clips, deleted scenes, as well as Blu-ray, DVD, Ultraviolet and in the case of the last two films, 3D Blu-ray copies. Included are a few collectors items as well. I watched this set for a while, and was able to purchase it for about two hundred dollars, which I felt was a fair price. The packaging was quite nice, a little heavier than cigar-box grade. I love the films, of course, and was very satisfied with the extras and the design and appearance of this all inclusive boxed set. Extended editions or directors' cuts of the later films would have been nice, but since I've never seen any available anywhere, I can't really complain about their absence here.",1378598400,2,876,4.621794871794871

5083226,4,B007FSEAHY,"I absolutely love this collection. I wanted it the day it was released. I almost preordered it. But it was VERY pricey at that time. Too pricey for most Potter fans, including me. I am so glad I waited! I took advantage of the lower prices on it now that it has been around for a while. I think I would have been disappointed had I paid the original $500 price tag for it. But for $200, which is what I paid, it was worth every penny. However, I see now that I got a real steal on this item, it appears the price has gone back up somewhat. Don't know if I would have paid over $300 for this set even now that I have it. I'm glad I got it when I did.

It has all the movies in bluray, dvd, and digital, plus bonus footage, behind-the-scenes looks, and some cool extra features. Just the box itself is amazing! The dvd's are packaged beautifully in individual book-like boxes for each movie. It has all sorts of little compartments, some kind of hidden, with all sorts of movie memorabilia. The only thing it didn't have was a marauder's map. I would have liked one of those.

I will say that if you are a Harry Potter nut, you will love this set. OK, I also own a cloak, a wand, a time-turner, and a broom (I only use them on Halloween, I mean, I'm not totally nuts). That is how much I love the world of Harry Potter. If you love it just as much, then this will be the piece de resistance of your collection. And despite the fact that they didn't sell nearly as well as expected (mainly because of the cost issue, I think), they are still a limited edition and someday will no longer be available.

I will also say that if you already have all 8 movies on bluray or dvd, then you may want to wait until the price comes back down. The features and knick-knacks that come with this set are not worth the money if you already own all the movies. But if you don't, or if you still want a really nice collector's edition of the films, then this will suit you just fine.",1378080000,5,1964,4.109375
5083227,3,B007FSEAHY,"When I first heard about this set, I was way excited. I hadn't bought a single harry potter movie all these years because I was waiting for ""The Ultimate Collectors Set"". So when it finally came out and I saw a price tag of $350, I was really bummed out. I couldn't believe that they would charge that much for a set of movies and a fancy box. I could have bought all the ultimate editions for cheaper than that. I decided to wait because I had seen so many negative reviews from people complaining about the price. I figured that Amazon and warner brothers would have to give in and lower the price some day. Finally, about a year after this item was released, I saw that it was on sale for $209. I still thought that the price was too hight, but I don't think it will get any lower than that. So I jumped on the opportunity and bought it. The next day they raised the price again. When the product finally arrived, it was in a huge box and it was heavy. I pulled it out of the box and looked at it in all its glory. It is huge. The cardboard is really like wood. It is hard and durable. The drawers and little compartments are cool. The little things in it, like the locket and map are ok, but all that stuff definitely do not make this thing worth more than $200. I was lucky I saw it on sale that day. I would never have bought it otherwise.

The box sits there next to the tv since it doesn't fit on the movie shelf. I don't know where we'll put it permanently, but it is nice to have. It looks nice. It was really well done. We have watched the first two films so far. The first movie jumped and froze. I am trying to get with amazon and have them send me a replacement first disc. The second movie was fine. I hope that there aren't others that jump and freeze.

For those who already have these movies and are bummed out about the price, it's not really worth it for the price they want for it. All you'll be getting extra is a fancy box, a few little things made in china, and an extra disc. So you consider if that is worth the hefty price tag or not.",1378080000,2,2061,4.049019607843137

5083237,4,B007FSEAHY,"I managed to get this when it dropped to $209 for a bit. I started to get into the films, and found this to be a hell of a deal at that price. It's a nice set with some cool hidden items along with the easy to find ones. My issue, and the reason for one less star, is how the discs sit. Most jewel cases have a slight raise to them around the center so the disc doesn't quite sit on the case, which may scratch it up some when it moves if it did. The cases, while nice looking, have this hard plastic for the disc holders, and the discs are not raised up slightly to protect them properly, nor is the plastic given a smooth coating to prevent scratches. The Blu-Ray copy of the third film (I forget the name) had enough of a scratch in it to keep about a minute of the film unwatchable, and later on I found that the Blu-Ray disc of The Deathly Hollows part 2 is also slightly scratched enough to make about 15 to 20 seconds of a scene impossible to watch. It's the scene where Harry gets a certain someone's tears to learn of what was really going on. The discs are held firmly in place when they're in their holders, so I'm not 100% sure if that's what scratched them, but discs can be scratched if turned in place against the plastic. Scratched Blu-Ray discs, go figure. Normally they hold up quite well, so something really bad happened to them. Makes me wonder if they weren't scratched before placed in the cases.

Luckily Amazon was kind enough to refund me 40% of what I paid if I chose to keep the set, which I did, and there's a movie rental place in town that I was able to take the third movie to and they buffed up the disc so now I can watch it. I need to take Deathly Hollows over and get that worked on too. I know it removes some of the protective coating, but I take care of my discs, so it'll be alright.

I wish some of the discs had been in better shape, but maybe it was just my set. I don't know if the DVDs have unwatchable parts, I seen marks on some of them too, but I doubt I'll watch those, so who cares. I just hope all the special features work fine when I get around to watching them.",1377734400,,2115,4.033333333333333
5083238,5,B007FSEAHY,"I received this box set for my birthday a few months ago, which saved me the cost. But when it comes to this set I would have (with my own cash) easily and very happily paid twice as much.
The box itself is a treasure. With incredible craftsmanship and all sorts of neat features it is a site to behold.
Then you have the discs hidden in drawers and secret cubbies. Sure you end up with a couple copies of the same movie but who cares, you would buy the blu-ray/DVD copy in stores and wouldn't get even half of the incredible special features that comes with this set. I've watched over 10 hours of special features without even starting to fall into the realm of ""bored"". And guess what, im not even halfway done!
Now onto all the extras. INCREDIBLE! Absolutely love the high quality maps, blueprints, and special art that accompanies the films. And to top it off a replica horcrux. That's just awesome.

It would be nice to see other sets as well thought out, that hit a bit of everything that's possible to try and please everyone which we all know is impossible. I would love to see a Star Trek, Star Wars, and many others, set up in this way. The mission impossible was great as well as was man from uncle. We all know anyway that these movie studios are set up to make as much money as they can if you don't believe that check ticket prices at the movie theaters. My advice to those of you who have all these major complaints with this set. First of all Purchase the set then take a hard look at all you get with it. Second, the next time a muti movie is starting up be more choosey about what you purchase. Once again if you didn't purchase do not comment. This set is fabulous. Harvey.

5083242,5,B007FSEAHY,"From the moment this was announced, I looked forward to the day I could own this set. As a fan of the series, a complete, deluxe collection is something I'd be more than happy to display on my shelf. Without having my hands on it, when it was originally for sale, the $350 was outside of my price range and I didn't see how it could possibly be worth the $350 they were charging for it.

Once it was on sale for around $200, I felt it was a more reasonable amount to purchase. And when it arrived the other day, I could not have been more impressed, with few exceptions. Weighing in at around 20 lbs., this set is truly massive. Displaying it in its boxed form takes a lot of space. I'd love to find a way to display it completely open, but frankly, I don't know if I would be able to find the space anywhere in my house for something like that. At any rate, I was very surprised at how well it was put together.

The box has a false leather sort of feel, making it feel far more professional than I would have expected. Each drawer is lined with a soft felt material that keeps each piece of memorabilia and the disc sets very snugly. The whole thing seems very well put together. All of the included memorabilia was definitely solid, with the best piece clearly being the horcrux locket. Direct from The Noble Collection, one of the premiere suppliers of Harry Potter merchandise, this costs like $50 on its own to purchase from Noble (that is if it's the exact same part, which I have yet to confirm.) At any rate, it's a fantastic locket, and if you want to walk around with a Slitherin locket on, well, it's there for you to try.

I've yet to go through all the special features, but it contains every special feature from every previous release of these discs, making this the most comprehensive special feature set that you'll find probably for several years. Most of the new stuff is included on Blu-Ray discs and there are several old documentaries on DVDs. I would have preferred to have everything in HD, but the stuff that is in HD is completely worth it.

As for the complaints about extended editions, I believe those to be unfounded. None of the movies were planned for extended editions. The first two happened to have more stuff available, possibly because Chris Columbus was so intent on following the blueprint of the books. The following directors streamlined the books far more, often times out of necessity. But unfortunately, this was not like Lord of the Rings in which Jackson prepared for all the extra material. So I would honestly be shocked if we got true extended editions ever.

If there is one complaint I have, the cloth map of Hogwarts is almost completely faded and nearly incapable of having the words read. The cloth looks like you're looking at it from the back and light is shining through, but it is in fact the front. This was incredibly disappointing because I was hoping to hang up this cloth, but in its current condition it does not seem like something I'd like to do. I've seen a couple of other reports that this is the case, so instead of replacing the entire set in which the rest of the materials were in perfect condition, I opted to keep the entire set instead of returning it potentially multiple times. It's unfortunate that I'm unable to check it out but I guess with everything else this set contained, it's one small mark on an otherwise fantastic set. But if that's what you're primarily excited about, I'd say buyer beware.

When all is said and done, if you consider yourself a huge Harry Potter fan, $200 is definitely money well spent, even with the cloth map issue. In fact, even the $350 would have been worth it now that I actually have it in my possession. I can't wait to keep it on my shelf for years and years to come.",1376006400,2,3787,4.441726618705036

That being said, I've gone through 7 sets, and still have 2 discs with errors.  Am about to order another and go through and return, hoping to get a full set that works.

5083245,5,B007FSEAHY,"Like most other Potterheads, I was waiting in rapt anticipation for the release of this box set. Then the reviews from fans started pouring in and it seemed like everyone was giving the set the most negative reviews I have ever seen about a Potter product or a box set for that matter. So I waited and waited until the price finally dropped on Harry/JK's birthday (July 31st, duh)! Let me tell you something; DON'T BE FOOLED, THIS IS AN AMAZING BOXSET!!!!

First off to all the haters (Muggles) that griped about how there is not enough behind the scenes footage, extras and deleted scenes:
1. Warner Brothers is NEVER going to release all 50,000 hours of footage they have from the 8 films.
2. When has there ever been a box set where the studio released as much extras/footage as this box set has?
3. These mythical ""alternate endings"" and ""extended cuts"" DO NOT EXIST! These movies cost a kagillion dollars to produce and they were working with over 10,000 pages from the books. Things got cut, the story was whittled down to its essential core (this is an endless debate among Potterheads so I won't go into that). That being said the screenwriter only wrote certain scenes and those were the scenes that made it into the films! This so called plethora of extra scenes and alternate endings are mythical unicorns. What was in the screenplay got shot and most of it made it into the films. There are definitely deleted scenes, and you get all of them in this set. Seriously (Siriusly), people you aren't going to get all those scenes you miss from the books: just let it go!!!

Second, people were saying the box set had flimsy packaging and was cheaply made. NOT TRUE!
1. I am a graphic designer and have made my own packaging; this set was not cheap to design or produce. You are getting your money's worth and in fact, I bet WB is losing money hand over fist because the sets cost so much. I mean the MSRP is $500, and the packaging is well worth that.
2. This set is huge and weighs a ton. It came triple boxed and once I finally got the set out it weighed about 35lbs. This is not flimsy packaging my friends. Yes, it is a cardboard composite, but what were you expecting a metal (Hogwarts) trunk! The pictures on the website do not do it justice, it is over 2' tall and 1.5' wide.
3. The overall design of the set is beautiful and ingenious. I guess most people just don't understand all the work that goes into designing a package like this. There are lots of drawers to pull out and they have pop open hinges that lock the drawers in place and then they pop out when you push them. Each drawer of various sizes contains 2-3 ""books"" with each movie inside and 3-4 discs per movie. The graphic design for each of the movie books is different for each one and very beautiful. Contrary to what people have said the books that the discs are in are not flimsy and have good clasps and each disc has its own (1/4"" thick) page. There are also truly hidden compartments (nearly invisibility cloak level) where some of the merchandise (books/posters) and bonus secret discs are. Overall it is an amazing piece of package design!

Thirdly, the complaints that there are not enough extras.
1. See the product description for full details of everything that is in the set, but I can tell you it's a lot and it's mostly things that Potterheads have not seen before. Granted, the Slytherin necklace has been available but the set has the actual chain metal one (not the plastic toy one). There are books with tons of rare photos. There's a booklet of all the graphics for products that you never saw or never even knew where in the movies. But, my favorite is a poster of set designer Stuart Craig's plot of Hogwarts and the evolution of the castle's architecture through all the movies (wicked)!!
2. The hidden bonus disc for the 7th movie is great and has amazing behind the scenes footage.
3. Yes, the 8 part series ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" was on all the Ultimate Edition sets, but come on they're great and that's where all your bonus footage is! If you were one of the people that bought all 7 Ultimate Editions, why are you re-buying this set and then griping that it has the same DVDs and features? Warner Brothers isn't going to reinvent the wheel for you.
4. There are also great behind the scenes specials from Britain and you get 3D versions of 7.1 and 7.2 (I think they should have thrown in some 3D Spectroscopes but really you get so much stuff already).
5. If you add up all the bonus features and footage there is probably at least 20 hours.

To make a long review short (too late)...Get over it people! I mean Merlin's Beard, this is a great box set that any true Harry Potter fan should love to own. It is by no means worthy of 1-3 stars. No, it's not perfect but just go have a chocolate frog and enjoy your awesome box set.

5083246,5,B007FSEAHY,"When I first saw how low of a rating this product had, I was dismayed. How could a collection with such potential be so poorly received by fans? This product was designed by MinaLima, the god and goddess of all things graphically wondrous in HP! My heroes!

So, I began digging around in the comments to learn where this set had gone wrong. Right away, I discovered the rating was not an accurate representation of the product at all, but rather the unfortunate and annoying result of non-reviews and other things that don't belong here. If you don't own a product or haven't used it, you have no business leaving a review for it. If you want to speculate, complain or otherwise air grievances, use a suitable forum for that - or better yet, write to the offending company and tell them yourself. People who visit this page want to learn about the PRODUCT (good or bad), not wade through a bunch of unrelated noise.

Anyway, pet peeve. Moving on. Time for a review!

IN A NUTSHELL
This set is essentially all seven Ultimate Editions repackaged in a limited-edition box, with a new bonus disc of extras (interviews, behind the scenes) that can only be found with this collection. It also comes with a handful of knick-knacks and printed materials, including a replica of the Slytherin locket (a piece from the Noble Collection) and a certificate of numbering and authenticity.

DO YOU NEED THIS?
If you already own the movies on DVD, Blu-ray or as Ultimate Editions and you're perfectly happy with those, then no, you don't ""need"" this set. Aside from the one bonus disc of extras, everything else on the rest of the discs is available elsewhere.

One thing to note, as I've seen this in several reviews: only movies 1 and 2 have extended editions. This is true no matter what set you buy. The ""extended"" movies shown on TV are just the films with the deleted scenes included, not some special version somewhere you're missing out on. And while it's inevitable that another box set (or twelve) will make its way into stores in the years to come, possibly with some remastered or additional things, I can't imagine it would be worth waiting for since it's not like there is any new footage to dig up and use at this point. I think what they planned to release has all been released.

WHY I BOUGHT THIS
As a fan of the books and movies (and the set tours and exhibitions) the one thing that never fails to amaze me is the attention to detail the artisans have put into crafting this world. And as a fan, what more could I want except to be a part of that world; to experience it and live it? That was the reason I wanted to add this set to my permanent collection. This feels exactly like something you'd find in Harry's world -- in some ways, it's very Weasley-ish, with its sneaky hiding places, charming contraptions and unexpected delights.  It's a collectible, plain and simple.

Sure, the price tag on this doesn't make it a spontaneous purchase for most people, nor will it be accessible to all fans because of it. But that's true of any high-end collectible. At the time I got this, the price was just over $200 -- that's a steal considering all seven Ultimate Editions together average $250, and there I wouldn't get the rest of the objects (or the box itself) that come with this set. So, at the end of the day, it's really about what you value most in HP merchandise that will decide if this is for you or not.

THINGS TO NOTE
1. It's HUGE. And heavy! I've never had a reason to pay attention to the dimensions of a box set of DVDs before, because normally they just fit on a regular shelf alongside all the other plastic movie cases. Not this one. The photo doesn't provide any real context, but the actual size is 12"" W x 12"" D x 14"" H. I'm sure that won't help you picture it any better, but suffice to say, it's a beast, and it may cause you to improvise or change where you had planned to store it.

2. It ships in custom packaging. The set itself is wrapped with tissue and packed with styrofoam inside a product box with full-color artwork, and then that's packed snug inside a plain cardboard box for shipping. (I suppose I should disclaim this by saying yours may differ, but this is how mine arrived.) Yet another detail someone thought to consider: getting it to you undisturbed and in pristine condition. An important thing for collectors!

3. The quality overall is very nice and the box is absolutely gorgeous. It has a luscious, suede-like texture and was very cleverly planned and executed.

4. It looks amazing on display. Sometimes I just have to walk by the shelf where I keep it so I can admire how it looks. Trust me, you will do this, too.",1375747200,8,4680,4.459649122807018
5083247,5,B007FSEAHY,"Wait for this to go down in price. Thank god I share my b-day with jo and harry because it was marked down to 209.99. I bit the bullet even though I have the blurays and dvds, for my collection. This thing is huge. Insanely bigger than I ever thought. Big as a coffee maker. The casing is well constructed. As by looking at the picture you see the drawers, the walls that slide out and 2 hidden drawers with spring locks. I don't care what the other 1 star reviews wrote. This is a must have and at 209.99.this cant be beat. Look for review videos inyoutube for a better look.",1375747200,4,576,4.151785714285714
5083248,1,B007FSEAHY,Not a chance WB.  Your discs give nothing new.  Your digital copy is ultraviolet crap.  Not worth the money.  Ultraviolet is what forces owners to use backup programs for true digital copies.,1375228800,2,191,4.875
5083249,5,B007FSEAHY,"Let's get a couple things out of the way:

1. Extended editions only exist for Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets.  All the people complaining that they won't buy anything until they see extended editions for the other 6 movies don't seem to understand that what they want does not, and will never, exist.  ABC Family has spliced in the deleted scenes to their TV broadcasts to give the appearance of extended editions for the other movies.

2. Nearly all of the bonus footage and extra documentaries etc. is identical to what is contained in the Ultimate Editions.  There is one bonus disc with a limited amount of unique special features in this product.

Now that we've cleared that up, here's what you need to know if you are considering buying this.  If you want all of the special features that exist you need to either buy this Wizard's Collection or buy the 7 Ultimate Editions individually.  If you buy the Wizard's Collection you get the awesome display box that looks like a Weasley's Skiving Snackbox.  It comes with the secret compartments and all the special knick knacks that are only available through this product.  If you buy the Ultimate Editions you will get 7 seperate movie cases that will all fit onto the shelf with your other DVDs/BRs.

So you need to ask yourself, ""Is the price difference between the Wizard's Collection and the Ultimate Editions worth it to get the knick knacks and display box?""  I answered yes and bought the Wizard's Collection and am very happy that I did.

As of today, the Ultimate Editions are selling on Amazon for about $38 each.  7 X $38 = $266.  If you're going to spend $266 to buy all 7 Ultimate Editions, is it worth it to you to spend (insert todays price for the Wizard's Collection) to get the same footage plus the knick knacks and display box?

PS--Happy Birthday Harry!  Happy Birthday JK!",1375228800,27,1859,4.653374233128834
5083250,1,B007FSEAHY,"I already own half the stuff in this collectors edition, and I'm not about to pay hundreds of dollars for the rest of it.  Much as I would love to own some of the things in this set, like the map and blueprint of Hogwarts I don't want to have double copies of all the things I already own.  I think that WB should sell the bonus items seperately and for a much more reasonable price so that Harry Potter fans (who are the only people that would even consider buying this) can get what they want without having to pay an outrageous ammount for items that they already have.",1375056000,2,572,4.1909090909090905
5083251,1,B007FSEAHY,"Well, yet another box set with nothing new. It is the same DVD Blu-Ray quality as the 8 film collection. No 4000 conversion, not even cleaned up. Same length movies,no new scenes, no extra footage, just more of people you don't care about rambling on and on. There is way cooler and more comprehensible info and tid-bits in Pottermore. This is a clunky, poorly designed, box that takes up space, is not child friendly, and will eventually fall apart.

Overall this is a pathetic cash grab wrapped in a shiny box to make collectors look twice and make children tug on their parents sleeves and say ""WANT""!",1375056000,2,604,4.644859813084112
5083252,5,B007FSEAHY,"What do I think about this collection- I love it! I actually bought it, unlike the negative reviews posted BEFORE the release date by people who have no clue.  This set is fantastic.  The hidden compartments with all the extras is what makes the price amazing.
Plus, do the math on EIGHT blu-ray movies (all in cases with creative artwork you can display like book) and the extras.  Just $25 a blu-ray DVD for each of the eight DVDs is $200.
SPOILER:
You get a Slytherin Locket which sells for around $60
A tapestry of the Hogwarts Grounds to hang on a wall
Artwork for each movie
A label book

All kinds of other hidden extras.

This is the best collectors set & was obviously created by people who know the Harry Potter fans, wanted to create something unique & special, and infused magic into a collection box complete with hidden compartments.  If you just want the movies, go buy the movies- of course you'll pay less, but that is not the point of the collection!!!

And to all the people complaining about not getting extra footage, stop. The films themselves are a good enough reason to get the collection!",1375056000,8,434,4.37037037037037
5083254,5,B007FSEAHY,I don't think I can actually say all the things that I like about this set. I did buy it when it was half off and am not sure it is quite worth the original price but I feel I got my money's worth. The first thing I noticed was how heavy it was. The case is very sturdy. And we had so much fun finding all the little hidey holes.  We watch these movies over and over and are geeky HP fans. LOVE THIS!,1374710400,11,400,3.7058823529411766
5083255,5,B007FSEAHY,"This collection had every bonus feature that the original dvd releases included, plus every tv spot, trailer, tv special and tons more material. Interviews, goofy footage, a documentary about the woman herself, j.k.
There is also lots of great little trinkets that come in the fantastically crafted box. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you will enjoy this.",1374710400,8,358,4.983333333333333
5083256,5,B007FSEAHY,"Let me start by saying I purchased this item. I spent the money, got it , and have it in my possesion. If you are thinking about getting this collection and are reading reviews be weary of those who post a review and haven't purchased one. That being said here you go...

If you are a Harry Potter fan this is the collection for you. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worht it? Yes, if you are a collector. The thing to bear in mind is that this is a collectable, not just a dvd set. When you open the box you are amazed at the size and scope of the set. THis is a piece of art from the Noble collection that just happpens to contain all the Blue ray's DVD's and Ultraviolet copies of the movies. Any HP geek weill smile from ear to ear as you open each compartment and enjoy the contents. Everything included feels like an heirloom you'll want to protect and feature. If there is any issue with this collection it is trying to decide how to display it all. If you love HP and want to have something you will cherish then BUY THIS! If you want all of the movies and are just looking for a good collection this is probably not for you.

-----UPDATE-------

After having owned this beautiful set for several months I would like to say that my appreciation for it has grown. I really like having it sittign out for all to see and wish that I had a better place to feature it so that it could be displayed in its full glory. I am amazed that so amnt continue to write negative comments about his set, NEVER having seen it! Like my origianal review stated, is this set for everyone? No. Is it for you? Well if you're like me and you keep coming back to it like a kid staring through the window at a Nimbus 2000, then YES buy this set! I would reccommend putting it in your cart and waiting untill the price is right for your budget. That's what I did and waited, and wiated, and waited untill I was able to get it for around half of retail.",1373846400,10,1926,4.103448275862069
5083257,5,B007FSEAHY,"I don't often write reviews on Amazon, but this one warranted it.

I was cautious buying this set, given the number of poor reviews it had. I was also collecting the ""ultimate"" sets and didn't know if it was worth the switch. It certainly was.

First, the packaging is amazing. Very high quality. Absolutely astounding for a Blu Ray set. Each movie has its own ""book"", which looks equally great, and even works well on my movie self. All the artwork is perfect down to the finest detail. The extras the set comes with are also phenomenal. The locket is very high quality, the stills and pictures are frame worthy, and the cloth map of Hogwarts is probably my favorite bit of Harry Potter merchandise i have (and i have quite a lot). It also contains a bonus disc, not present in the ultimate sets, a few extra features to enjoy.

Most negative reviews seem to focus on what the set doesn't have. Including extended edition of movies 3-8. I would be bothered by there absence if they existed in another release. But they dont. I'm doubtful they will ever exist, and if they do, it probably won't be on blu-ray. Until say the ""25th Anniversary Collection"" or whatever eventually comes out, this is the definitive collection. I am proud to have it. Worth full price.",1373414400,21,1263,4.579646017699115
5083258,4,B007FSEAHY,"This is a nice gift for the serious fan. The little trinkets it includes isn't great, but the box is an interesting conversation piece. All of the films are on blu-ray and it does include 3d versions of the last two films. There is a little overload with the different versions of the same film, especially when there's a DVD and blu-ray for a lot of them. This is where the HD-DVD format really worked out better with the HD version on one side and the standard format on the other.",1373068800,4,483,4.318681318681318

5083260,5,B007FSEAHY,"My husband got this for me for my birthday when it was the amazon deal of the day. Most people would think that $250 for 8 movies is crazy but I think it was worth every penny! When it arrived at the door I was shocked at the size of it. It is a lot larger an I thought it would be.opening it was an exciting experience for me and would be for any potter fan. Heavy duty and sturdy, the materials are top notch. There are even real hinges on the lid. Each movie comes in its own ""book"" that includes a DVD of the movie, a blu-ray of the movie and s disc with special features that were in the regular DVD package as well as a part (there are 8 parts total) of the making of all 8 films. The last two films of the series both have a 3d version of the movies as well.
What makes this even better is the extra goodies hidden in different compartments all over the box. You can read the product description and other reviews for the actual extras since i do not want to repeat what has already been said.
One of the better extras is that you also get a code for the ultraviolet copies of all eight films which is great for me because I have an iPad and can watch these movies anywhere I please.
I would not have bought this for myself as it is pretty cost prohibited but just absolutely love this set. I know there a reviewers who complain about buying another set of what they already purchased individually but I am the type of person who waits until a series I love ends and then I purchase the complete set.  The only exception to that rule is doctor who. I just had to have the David tennant collection ( but who could blame me on that one).",1371081600,12,1642,4.052307692307692
5083261,1,B007FSEAHY,"I keep wondering about those 5-star reviews, and whom are they coming from? It's ridiculous that people actually think this box set is worth the money. WB has screwed over Harry Potter fans over and over again with their re-re-releases of Special and Ultimate Editions (not to mention, they never released HP7 Ultimate DVD, just the Blu-Ray), and now this--with NO new material, except for the bonus disc which could have just been sold separately as a DVD. The inserts and books that came with this box set are mere, cheap toys that only a child of 8 would want. And like all the other reviews said, there are no extended versions of Movies 3-8. If you're a big HP fan, you know there are PLENTY of deleted scenes that never made it to the discs in the Ultimate, Special, and Wizards Collection. They have been released as raw footages by HP websites in the past, and yet we have never seen them officially released in DVD. I know, for a fact, that Order of the Phoenix--for example--have a lot more scenes with the young Marauders, Snape, and Lily... and yet, those clips have never seen the light of day. Not in the Ultimate Edition, not in the 2-disc Special Editions, not in the Blu-Ray Editions, not in the Steelbook Editions, and not in the Wizards Collection!

I hate WB. They do not care about HP fans. They only care about profit.

Not that's a bad thing but when I expected something just larger than the disks itself and was given a box exceeding at least 20lbs I was a bit surprised. That said the detail, uniqueness and just overall technical execution of this collectors piece is fantastic and worth the buy.

THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER. Yes, it is a lot of money... But I am an HP geek and this makes me so f***ing happy!!!

The box is heavy, sturdy, and definitely not cheap. Every new compartment lead to a new squee of delight... Seriously I just kept giggling like a little girl.

With the packaging, the extras, and all the special features... This is definitely something every die hard HP fan needs to have. It is well worth the money in my opinion. Just to be able to own this magical (pun intented) collection is making me so happy, and was some of the best money I've spent in a long time.

There's a  cloth canvas map. A letter of acceptance, a metal Salazar Slitheren locket, cert. of Auth.

Plus it's more expensive then here on Amazon. The UK Amazon would not allow me to ship here to America, I tried a few different family address no luck ( I wanted the big black harry potter box, then I found this one).  Also the separate HP deathly hallows complete ultimate edition does not have the last 2 ultimate segments  7 or 8 of the whole ""the magic begins"" series. It is only in here in this set.

One of the few movies I will still buy/own on Bluray a disc. I more of a streaming person but my wife & I enjoy the HP series a lot.",1367107200,2,286,3.629032258064516

5083285,5,B007FSEAHY,"I really like this set as it has almost everything I could want in it. the map in the set is not in fact a marauders map as some have said, but rather it is a cloth map of Hogwarts ground unfortunately the detail are better seen in the picture presented on the box than on the map as the actual map is dark in color and rather blurry so it hard to read and decipher.",1367107200,,366,3.8289473684210527
5083286,5,B007FSEAHY,"Bought it for my daugher's 12 BD.  She was stunned and amazed.  Comes in it's own heavy case made like furniture.  She's a serious Potterhead and really enjoyed the extra scenes and interviews in the previous CDs so, this was over the top for her.  She emersed herself so deep into the behind the scenes CDs we had to pull her out to give herself a rest!  All the material in this set is first rate, includes many scenes selected and added by the director just for this set than what was in the theatrical releases increasing the detail of the films.  EXPENSIVE but well worth it, if you are that much into HP.  Our whole famiy loves this franchise so it was a good investment we all enjoy over and over. The ""horcrux pendant"" is a really nice touch and is well made prop, not toy junk. When played on a big screen HD w/3D TV and blue ray you'll see things in such detail it's like a whole new movie, plus you get the standard edition CDs so the kids can watch on the car DVD player or a non-blue ray computer for away from home watching.  The printed materials, CDs + accessories made this a really good deal, if you really love movies and HP in particular, I recommend you get one while you can.",1366588800,3,1197,4.219298245614035
5083287,4,B007FSEAHY,"My girlfriend, for whom this was a gift, didn't have too much of this content but she is quite the Potter fan. The box itself was a lot of fun to find all the hidden content. Overall it worked out great. Don't worry Amazon, my father will hear of this.",1365897600,,252,4.06
5083288,4,B007FSEAHY,"This is the one thing that my girlfriend didn't have when it came to Harry Potter. With no dvd previous, this was an excellent buy. But then again, I got this at half price. The 500 dollar price tag was the one thing that kept me from buying this in the first place.",1365724800,,266,4.037735849056604
5083289,5,B007FSEAHY,"I understand where a lot of people come from with disliking this product. BUT the majority of the reasons are because they already own all of the movies and don't want to spend that kind of money re buying them. I completely understand that. I fall into a unique situation where I grew up with these movies and my family owned all of them. But when I moved out to go to college I no longer owned any of them so this box set was perfect for me. You get anything and everything that has been produced over the last decade for Harry Potter.

Most people complain that they already own all of the ultimate editions and they have seen all of those special features but I didn't fall into that category. So I have no complaints at all about this set. I would go into detail about the quality of everything and the extras that you get but if you don't already know that stuff then there are plenty of other ways to get that information. YouTube is a good start. Perfect for all HP fans. Now my kids can grow up with Harry Potter as I did.",1365379200,5,1031,4.180904522613066
5083290,5,B007FSEAHY,"First let me say I never write reviews. But I felt compelled to in this case due to all of the ridiculous reviews of this product which truly serve to misrepresent this amazing set. To sum up in one word, this set is fantastic. Absolutely, 100% fantastic! Please note that if you read the reviews bashing this set that NONE of those people actually own this set and have probably never even laid eyes on it in person.

To clear up a few things they lie about...

1. This is not made cheaply. At. All. This set is wonderfully crafted using very sturdy materials that totally keep in harmony with the style of the Harry Potter world. I knew it was a nice set when I ordered it, but when it arrived I was stunned by just how nice it is. Nothing flimsy or cheap about it. I was like a little kid on Christmas and took a couple hours exploring it and all the amazing extra goodies that are included.

2. The Ultra Violet copies can most certainly, definitely be DOWNLOADED TO A DEVICE. Let me repeat, you do not have to stream these copies. Using the Flixster app or website, you can download the movies to an iPad, iPhone, Android, or PC and watch them while offline. Going to Hong Kong? You can have a marathon on the plane without using wifi. Again, these people who are saying you can't obviously haven't purchased the set and don't know what they're talking about.

3. This set contains every version of the films and every special feature available in the Potterverse, including a bonus disc only available in this set. It is essentially all the contents of the Ultimate Editions, including the Extended Editions of movies 1 and 2 and the 3D versions of Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2. In regards to the Extended Editions for all films, here is my opinion. First, I am not a huge fan of Extended Editions. The version of a film the director feels comfortable releasing to the public in the first place is obviously what he/she feels is the most superior version. To go back and simply add in scenes that were originally considered unnecessary just seems silly to me. But, to each their own. In this set we have the Extended Editions of movies 1 and 2. Since Movie 7 was split into two movies, it seems highly unlikely that Extended Editions will ever be made (or needed) for these two. Alfonso Cuaron wants nothing more to do with Potter ever, so getting a new edition of Film 3 seems very unlikely. That leaves a slim possibility of getting an edition for movies 4-6. WB has not shown much interest in doing any more extended cuts and truthfully they would have done them for the Ultimate Editions if they were going to do them at all. Bottom line, this is THE definitive set for the Potter films. Sure, WB is going to milk it at some point and release anniversary editions, etc. but these will more than likely just be repackaged editions of this existing material.

4. The price. Yes, it's expensive. When the set was originally announced I was totally stoked until I saw the $500 list price. Then I laughed! Even the normal Amazon price of around $350 was off-putting enough for me to wait and keep my nose pressed against the glass wanting this set but not buying it. Then, it was the deal of the day for $250 last week and it was a no-brainer for me. After selling my existing DVD and Blu-ray copies which then became redundant, I got this set for under $200. An amazing bargain for such an amazing collector's set. In retrospect after seeing the set in person, I would pay the $350 for it. It is a stunning, amazing set that is a must for any true Potter fan.

Bottom line, don't listen to the haters who don't know what they're talking about. This set is an incredible purchase and you most certainly won't be disappointed in the quality and content of the product.",1365206400,15,3773,4.437229437229437
5083291,5,B007FSEAHY,"I purchased this, on a gold box amazon deal a week or so ago.  So I paid $250, not full price.  I felt compelled to write a review (something I rarely do on here), because of the amount of bad reviews this set got prior to the release of this set.  I am a pretty big fan of HP, and only owned the DVDS prior.  This set was MADE for me!  I can't explain the craftsmanship that went into creating this boxed set.  My wife and I are simply in love with it.  The box alone is HEAVY, and made of what appears to be some form of wood covered by faux leather.  The design, does have a magical feel to it, and each indidivual movie 'book' has fantastic artwork.  I just genuinely am giddy when I think of the set WB released.  If you don't own the movies on Blu Ray, and want the definitive versions, with all the bells and whistles, as well as some swanky artwork, and other goodies, look no further!",1364947200,8,893,4.051428571428572
5083292,5,B007FSEAHY,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this product and most of those were done before the product even came out. So you should pay no attention to any of those.

I had been considering this item for a while since my wife and I are huge Potter fans and when it was a Deal of the Day I knew I couldn't pass it up.

We were not disappointed. The display case goes great with our decor in our living room. The extras are fun and add to any Potter collection. We were also happy to get extended versions of movies that we only had the theatrical releases for previously.

It is pricey and rather robust, but if you are a Potter Geek then I think you would find value in this item. I know I did.",1364947200,9,691,3.9927536231884058
5083293,5,B007FSEAHY,"Alright, let's end some of the misconceptions about this product. You can choose to be angry at Warner Bros. for not releasing the extended versions of the later films. From what I've heard, they're not going to be released, let alone included in a set. That's no reason to rate this product so low. I've also noticed many have impugned this collection's quality without having seen it, saying the price is too much for some paltry, cardboard box and a few trinkets. I would posit that none of these posters have any idea what they're talking about. First of all, the chest these movies come in is huge. It is so much bigger than what the picture would have you believe, you will likely think your order was mixed up with somebody's purchase of a nightstand or a crate of oranges, perhaps. This thing is BIG. Secondly, it is SO friggin' heavy. I would lift this set to build muscle mass on a daily basis if I cared at all about not looking like a shapeless fatty magoo. Oh, and cardboard? Nuh-uh. This thing is made with some high-quality stuff. I won't speak to what kind exactly, since I failed my random materials 101 course, but I would place the outside of the chest's construction as much closer to wood than cardboard on a scale of thickness and durability. Finally, the presentation. Oh sweet gravy-soaked giblets, the presentation. This set blows every other set I've purchased completely out of the water in terms of presentation. As I pulled the chest's wings apart to expose its inner workings for the first time, a thought occurred to me: ""This chest will be a family heirloom. My children will proudly present my Harry Potter collection to their children and relate some anecdote about how much this meant to them or why this set was super important to me."" I'm having difficulty even now in believing this set was not itself crafted by actual wizards. As for the movies and the goodies inside, the Amazon description makes it clear enough what to expect. However, if you are waffling on this purchase because of all the disparaging comments made about its presentation and construction, DON'T. This is the coolest, biggest, most gorgeous collection of movies you or I could ever hope to possess in our lifetimes. Don't let cynicism ruin your opportunity to own something as cool as this set. Don't let your dying regret be that you didn't buy it.",1364860800,848,2361,4.677884615384615
5083294,5,B007FSEAHY,"I am so thrilled to have been gifted this amazing Harry Potter Wizard's Collection.  I want to start out saying that over the years I have resisted purchasing anything other than the DVD's for all of the Harry Potter films in the hopes that an ultimate collection would be offered.  Also thanks to Amazon for offering it as on of the special deal last week.  We decided this was the time to take the plunge and get an Amazon account also because it saved us an extra 30.00.  Thanks to all of this we got our set for a very reasonable price of 219.00 with free shipping and handling, what an amazing price for all that is included.  I love every thing that is in this well constructed set, from the box design to the hidden treasures.  The cases for each year have wonderful design elements that are themed to that particular book and are very sturdy and well constructed also.  I don't feel that I will ever have to worry about excessive wear and tear because it is so well put together.  The Certificate of Authenticity is a super nice touch and I was very surprised that our set was # 4,320 out of 63,000.  What a shock that we got such a low production number.  As for the quality of the picture and sound I am amazed at the difference between my little old DVD vs. the Blu Ray, they have come such a long way with this technology and even on my little 20"" flat screen the picture is AMAZING.  Thanks so much to everyone who helped put this together for those of us who are over the top Harry Potter fans.",1364860800,10,1508,4.256140350877193
5083295,5,B007FSEAHY,"Oh my good lord.... I absolutely loooooove this collection!! I bought it the other day when this item was amazons ""deal of the day"". $250 was still pretty pricey, but I figured I would never see it any lower than that and bought it. It arrived promptly and in great condition. I 'ohh'ed and 'ahh'ed the entire time I spent looking through all the compartments. :) Now I'm all set to have a harry potter marathon next week. :)",1364860800,8,425,4.3924050632911396

When it arrived at my door it was a 15 lb box, minimum!  It is made of great materials and in the most detailed presentation any boxed set of anything I have purchased.
I am a great fan of Harry Potter, not a die hard fan, but I can tell you I've read each book, heard each book on audio at least 20 times and seen each movie dozens of times.  When I opened this box set, this man felt like a kid on Christmas Morning.  If you enjoy the movies, like behind the scenes materials (albeit not all new) then this is a great addition to your DVD collection - just be prepared to receive a set around the size of a small, tall footstool.
Amazon should enter dimensions, weight and materials if they have not already because it was a surprise to me.",1364601600,9,995,4.226315789473684

5083298,5,B007FSEAHY,"**UPDATED 6/17/13**
I've been slowly plodding through all 31 discs and finally hit a snag with DH1.  It seems like those nasty ""damaged movie"" rumors are true, at least in part.  Although the disc doesn't appear to be wholly damaged (I did check them all for scratches and found nothing out of the ordinary) this movie is unplayable in at least two parts, and it skips over a couple of scenes (it stops right when Ron is about to destroy the horcrux locket....effffff).  I did attempt to call Amazon customer service but as the collection is no longer for sale through them, the most they were willing to offer me was a refund, despite it being past the return date.  That doesn't work for me as I purchased this on a gold box deal and I'm not guaranteed that by spending more the quality control issue would even be fixed.  So alas, it appears I am stuck with at least one damaged movie.  I guess it's a good thing I didn't get rid of my old ultimate editions yet, so I still have at least one playable copy of DH. Just be aware that the QC issues haven't necessarily been rectified.

Let me preface this review by stating I bought this set during the Amazon lightning deal last week, so I paid $100 less than what it's going for now.  I've wanted this since I heard it was being released last year, despite already owning (at that time) the Ultimate Editions of movies 1-6.  I wasn't willing to pay $350 for it then, mostly because I just wasn't in a position to spend that kind of money.  Despite buying DH 1&2 ultimate edition, I jumped on this lightning deal when I saw it because I wasn't sure I was ever going to see it for less.  I am VERY glad I did.

This is not going to be a review full of whining about how expensive it is (though it is, quite obviously, expensive), or how it's cheap and Warner Brothers is just a bunch of greedy goblins for thinking any self-respecting Potter fan would dare be expected to pay this much for something that is not worth it.  Those reviews were either A) written by Muggles (the worst sort imaginable) or B) written by people who don't even own this set.

I can say with full confidence that this set was most definitely worth the $250 price tag.  It's actually probably worth the $350 Amazon normally charges, though not the $500 retail price (which I think most people know is a joke).  I'm very thankful for having the opportunity to snag this for the lightning deal price, but I probably would have bought it for $350, I just would have waited and saved up a little longer for it.  The detail on this set is ridiculous (or riddikulus), and I think Potter fans should be straight-up honored at the attention and care that went in to putting this together.  Most complete movie collections out there come in some stupid slipcase, and maybe you'll get a dumb bust or action figure to go with it.  Not so here.  I'm not much for buying these collector thingies, mostly because they take up lots of room, but this is reminiscent of what I've seen of the super delux Lost set, or maybe even the Alias one that came in the Rambaldi box.

The box this thing comes in is MASSIVE, Hagrid-sized almost.  It is NOT cheap cardboard, as others have noted, but a nice, thick, solid-feeling cardboard that is embossed with a pebbled-leather texture.  There are metal handles and drawer pulls, and overall it has a nice, solid, sturdy feel.  It's heavy too.  So no cheap pacakaging or slipcases.  The artwork is just lovely, and I think any real Potter fan will appreciate it.  Each of the 8 movies comes in its own little cardboard book (like some kids books are made of), outfitted with its own coordinating color scheme that plays off the theme/color scheme of each movie.  The discs included are the exact same things you'll find in the already released Ultimate Editions.  What I will say is that the ""extras"" that came with the UE's (lenticular cards, collectible books, and character trading cards) are NOT included here, so the only thing that repeats is the actual disc-content.  If you're a completist/super HP mega fan like me, you might want to hold on to whatever ultimate editions you have for this reason.  I did not appear to receive any scratched discs like some others have, nor did any of my movies come out the cases.  I haven't watched anything yet, but by the looks of it it's all perfect so it should be fine.  No missing content either, so it appears they've sorted out their manufacturing issues.

The new content includes two books of graphic art, the Horcrux locket (metal Noble Collection version), a blue print poster map thing of Hogwarts, an EXTREMELY nice fabric tapestry wall hanging of the Hogwarts grounds, some sketches by Stuart Craig (very nice cardboard, all ready for framing) and some lithographs of art from each movie, also sutiable for framing.  You also get a disc of exclusive-to-this-set bonus content; I have yet to watch that so I can't say if it's worth it or not, but it sure looks fun.  You also get a little scroll with a code that enables you to download digital copies of all movies.  Yes, I said download.  You have to download the Flixster app (for your computer/smartphone/tablet), as I believe you do for all WB movies, but yes, you CAN download the movies to your device and watch them without needing to be online.  You just need the Flixter app to do it, which IMO is not a huge deal, because it's not like they're going to be any better or worse watching through Windows Media Player or anything.  So I call bollocks on anyone saying you can't download these and can only stream them.  Lies.  And we must not tell lies.

I'll wrap this up by saying that this set is marketed very specifically to collectors and mega-fans.  If all you want is the movies, then this is not for you.  If that's all you wanted, you have no right to go out there and complain that they're charging too much, because nobody's forcing you to buy it.  It's a collector's set.  You have the opportunity to go out there and buy the Ultimate Editions, thus obtaining almost the same amount of disc content you get here, plus they all have coordinated packaging that looks nice on a shelf together if you like that sort of thing.  So what if you can't buy them all in one box?  Does that really matter if you just want the movies?  Probably not, so shut up if that's all your after.

If you don't already own any of the UE's, this set is a wonderful investment, even at the $350 price tag.  If you consider you'll be paying around $30-$40 on average for each UE (depending on whether you're getting DVD or bluray, and depending on where you're buying it) you're paying a fair amount of extra money for the EXTREMELY nice presentation and extra collectibles and content.  $350 is a fair price for this set.  $500 is not, but nobody is going to be paying full price for this.

In closing, if you're a big HP fan, you CAN'T pass this up.  You just can't.  I know it's a lot of money, but the real HP fans out there (books and movies) are going to find so much to appreciate here.  If you're scared of the price, it might be a good idea to get an Amazon card when you buy it.  You'll get some money off and earn some points on it (not shilling for the card here, just offerring suggestions on taking the price down for those that might be concerned about it).  If you just liked the movies and want maybe a handful of extras, you are much better off buying the individual UE's or waiting for a possible mid-priced set (which may never come).  If you just want the movies with no frills, get the $50 box set that's out there.  If you're one of those weirdos that has some odd sense of entitlement that, as a fan, you should be automatically entitled to the biggest bestest set on the planet, with loads of extras, for a ridiculously low price, then I suggest you either be quiet or stand in front of a mirror and cast a crucio curse on yourself.  It's not going to happen.  You get a lot of bang for your buck here, and while it might not suit a lot of fans, the people it IS marketed towards are going to LOVE it.  It's obvious a lot of thought was put into this set, and it is definitely on the same level as some of the other similar mega collection sets out there.  It's not like WB got together with some Death Eaters and purposely conspired to charge a lot just to HP fans.  Members of other fandoms have been subjected to the same pricing system as us Potterheads, so we are definitely not alone.

I daresay after opening this box that I would be able to cast quite the formidable patronus.  It's THAT awesome.",1364515200,33,8580,4.407878017789073
5083299,5,B007FSEAHY,"This is the best box set that I have ever had. First off, the quality of the box is very good and looks amazing, as if it was pulled right from Hogwarts. Everything included is very well made, from the disc cases designed as books, to the Hogwarts blueprints, the high resolution glossy set photos, the tapestry, and even the horcrux Slytherin locket that is included, nothing looks or feels cheaply done. There are so many goodies that are hidden away in this set that I'm not even sure that I've found them all yet. All of the bonus features included look very entertaining and I'm looking forward to getting the chance to watch everything. This is the ideal gift set for any Harry Potter fan and I'm very happy with my purchase. The price may seem prohibitive, but after pulling the trigger and buying it, I can say that it was worth it.",1364515200,9,840,4.461038961038961
5083300,5,B007FSEAHY,"Im sorry but iignore the one star reviews of people whinning about this set not having extended cuts of the films (except for parts 1&2). The set is brilliant filled with hours of bonus material and all kinds of art, maps,and fun little chotchkys. The picture quality  on the films is wonderful and if you own a 3D TV Deathly Hollows parts 1&2 get a great 3D transfer.
 A lot of the one star reviews seem to be based on complaints that the set looks cheap. Belive me it is gorgeouse the screen shots do not do it justice. My wife was sceptical about the set due too price but after it got here and we saw the attention to detail in the packaging and extras we were b9oth convinced it was well worth the price.
 The other big complaint is lack of extended editions for flms 3-8. From tghe research ive done those versions of the movies will probably never exist. Warner seems to have lost intrest in doing them and this set will probably be the final word on Ultimate Editions of Harry Potter movies.
 If your a Harry Potter fan this set is great. Its that simple.",1364428800,5,1063,4.3
5083301,1,B007FSEAHY,"In looking at just the package, the total retail cost, the number of actual movies in it; this comes out to be $62.50 per movie... ignoring all the fluff.  At that price, I don't see a magical broom, a wand, photo cards of the actors/actresses, and some collectors statue of some actress (or actor)

Gotta keep milking that shrinking phat cow!",1364342400,2,343,4.60655737704918
5083302,5,B007FSEAHY,"So, I finally took the dive yesterday and bought the Harry Potter Wizard's Collection. I wanted to give a fair, reasoned review why and to advise customers who may be interested in this set, but may be on the fence about whether to make the leap or not.

I won't go over the countless individual features included in the 31 discs in this set, for they've been well documented by others. I will also ignore the Ultraviolet police who seem to stalk Amazon movie pages endlessly. They may have a point, but the issue is mute to me anyway. I bought my collection for the discs. And that brings me to the heart of the matter. Was buying the set worth it? For me, yes. And here's why: First of all, I'm a Blu-ray/DVD completist. This set carries over virtually every special feature ever released for Harry Potter on disc, whether on the previous wide-release DVDs, or on Best Buy/Target exclusive releases (i.e. the documentary When Harry Left Hogwarts, which is extended here). It also adds multiple TV specials and featurettes never released before. If you want all of the content that has or will be released on Harry Potter for some time, this is the set for you.

Second of all, I'm a Harry Potter nut. If you're a fan and don't own the eight movie soundtracks, you should. I also highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-Page-to-Screen-The-Complete-Filmmaking-Journey/dp/0062101897/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey</a>&nbsp;for its vast look into making the films. It's worth every penny. Let's not forget about the films themselves. Eight movies of this consistency and this quality in ten years is incredible. Like never-will-be-repeated incredible. Like movie history incredible. Plus, the cast and crew seem like brilliant and genuinely nice people. That's rare and worth supporting.

My recommendation to prospective buyers? Do your homework. There are multiple, detailed reviews and ""unboxings"" on YouTube that give you a good look at the boxset, both physically and feature-wise. Blu-ray.com is also a great source for seeing the content that you'll be buying, giving reviews and scores for both the Ultimate Editions and Wizard's Collection. There's no excuse to not know what you'll be getting in the mail. Is this collection padded with DVD copies that I probably won't use? Absolutely, but again I'm being fair, and this is a small negative versus many positives. These extended editions that people are clamoring for on films 3-7.2 simply don't exist, and adding deleted scenes into the movies doesn't make them any more special. Most of the deleted scenes we have on previous Harry Potter releases stink. Even the scenes added for the Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets extended editions here aren't that good. They're simply ABC Family editions.

Also, weigh what you own already versus the cost of buying this new collection. I already needed a substantial upgrade from my DVD copies of films 1-5, and the new content for films 6, 7.1, and 7.2 was more than enough to justify replacing the bare-bones Blu-ray copies of those I already owned. Plus, I was patient enough not to buy any Ultimate Editions in anticipation of an inevitable all-in-one release like this. Also, I had to be patient for a fair price. $350 is a bit too much for me. $250? That's much better, and part of why I sprung on yesterday's offer. Buying all 7 Ultimate Editions on Blu-ray individually at an average cost of $35 each equates to about $250 anyway, and that's not even including all of the neat extras you get in addition to the discs in this boxset.

The makers of this boxset certainly didn't skimp on quality or quantity, and as a fan, you have to be appreciative of that, despite the large asking price. Here's the verdict: If you're a fan of the films, love special features, and don't already own the Ultimate Editions, this set is totally worth a good sale price. It's even better when you need a Blu-ray upgrade for most of the films and like all of the movies in one neat, organized package. And I don't think this set will be around for many more years.

That being said, WB must be smoking crack to think that even a die hard fan like me would be willing to hand them $500 for this. I had the gold box deal come up offering it for $250 and I would not pay THAT for this set. As cool as this thing looks, it certainly is not worth the price they are asking, not in a million years.

5083305,1,B007FSEAHY,"Money. That's what this lame attempt at producing a HP boxed set is all about--a studio trying to rake in dollars from HP fans who are too impatient to wait for something better.

Think about it: even if you bought all eight movies individually it wouldn't cost you more than $100, even if you bought the stripped-down, bare-boned movie collection at amazon's $67.70 price. So what in the name of everything that's pure and holy am I getting with my additional $300? Special features? Even as much of a special features nut as I am there is no justification for spending that much money for making of features, bloopers, commentaries, and etc. These additions cost a studio pennies to produce, so the immensely inflated cost here is pointless. Even if purchased at the %50 discount price, you're still spending more on special features and fancy packaging then you are on the actual movies.

This is a COMPLETE RIP-OFF!

I'm with you, HP Fans. I empathize with your impatience. But WAIT! A better, extended, cheaper, and more worthy HP boxed set will arrive some day. Don't waste your money on this! We need to send WB the message that this hair-brained attempt to give us a special HP boxed set is unacceptable. We want more! We want better! We deserve better!",1364342400,13,1261,4.722727272727273

Too bad it is tainted by the fact that the films themselves (honestly, Warner Bros., that's what people really want from this) are not the director's cuts or extended versions, save for the first two movies. Yes, there are features galore - and again, some fans might want that stuff but most people aren't really interested in how stuff was done or made - we fans really want the extended versions.  It isn't the same as viewing the deleted scenes AFTER you've viewed the movie,  we want those scenes and any others pending to be added back in and offered in BluRay.  As incredible as this set seems, without those additions and, no matter how many times Amazon drops the price (the 50% off offer is bogus, they've been selling this thing for about 25% of the alleged price for over a year now) many of us won't buy this set because we know the extended versions will be release someday.

I doubt that it would've happened in shipping, as I just don't see how that could happen.

I say this because the dimensions in the description did not give me enough of an idea as to how huge this is. I love all of the artwork that I can frame and put up around my home. The necklace is a different one than the one you can get from Barns and Noble (I got it) and better quality too. I love the style of the box, however it can become annoying to have to completely open the box to get to one disk. It is made of quality paper and there are designs on every inch of it. You could easily take out the disks and use the box to hold other Harry Potter items. The hidden compartments were not hard for me to find, however it is fun knowing they are there.

As far as the disks go, this is basically a compilation of everything that has already come out. For those of us who didn't buy the Ultimate editions of Harry Potter hoping that someone would come out with something better, here it is. I admit, I do have a couple of the Ulimates but didn't have the money to buy them all. Also, other than the name cards and artwork books, there wasn't much extra offered in the Ultimate editions that isn't included in this box set. Keep in mind that you could have taken those same pictures and made the cards yourself and you can't frame the books. So in comparison, in my mind, the Ultimate editions come up short.

I looked at what this collection has and definitely, you should get the 11 discs version of the movies. Much cheaper and has the same special features without the bunch of booklets and stuff, which you are gonna watch once, and never see again (they are totally useless).

5083357,1,B007FSEAHY,"My husband is a HUGE Harry Potter fan.  He has read every single book, and seen every single movie. He absolutely refused to own a single Harry Potter DVD until all the movies were finished.  Why?  Because as he kept saying ""I bet they are going to release an AMAZING box set!""  Well. Last year the final movie came out.  And I waited and waited and waited to see ""the amazing box set""  that was going to come out- because every year I saw ""amazing box sets"" (remember the ones that came with the bookends? or the chess set one? didn't the UK get one with an elder wand?) I mean there were some really cool sets.  But it wasn't all the movies. So why bother.

Then they released all the movies.  But JUST the movies. No amazing box set with a wand or a chess set or fancy packaging like my husband had hoped.  So I bought it last year.  And don't get me wrong my husband was super happy and loved it, but we were just surprised.

Well. Then I see THIS! WOW!  This is the box set that I was looking for LAST year. you know, when the movies ended and all the movies came out on dvd.  But that's ok because for a TRIPLE DIGIT PRICE TAG THAT IS ALMOST AS MUCH AS MY MONTHLY ELECTRIC BILL this is going to have some AMAZING special features.  Movie wise. not just the box.

But no. No special anything really. I have read and re-read the list of what is included and just can't find anything.  Ultra-violet digital download? How does this help me?  I don't have ultra violet and when I want a digital download the whole point is that I want it on my device, I don't want to have to be connected to the internet. It completely misses the whole point.  Only extended version of one and two? My cable service runs extended versions of all the movies. How was this not able to happen?  Behind the scenes/making of? Are you joking?  You can find that anywhere - for free.  OOOOOOOO - a 3-D copy of the LAST MOVIE only. Even if I owned a 3-D capable device this would suck.

No special collectable. You can buy a Horocrux locket anywhere on the internet a lot cheaper then this box set.  A map of hogwarts? Again - can be bought for cheaper.  And I can buy the artifact boxes for each of the characters for less at the noble collection and get a lot more then a booklet. I would get the actual artifacts.

This collection is such an utter disappointment overall. For 300-500 dollars (depending on sale price that day) I would expect AT LEAST several hours of never before seen material, extended versions of ALL the movies and some sort of EXCLUSIVE collectable.",1353542400,15,2551,4.2625

It's a great collection, the special features are so interesting to watch, and the extra goodies are great to have!  Very good quality and it was fun to hunt for all the pieces.  It is expensive, but if you have the extra money to spend on this, you won't regret it.

The only thing that would make it better would be to have all the books included. (and maybe a place to stash your wand) Of course that would make it bigger and more expensive, but it would have everything a die hard fan could ever want.",1353283200,3,701,4.2406015037593985

5083362,5,B007FSEAHY,"Okay, I read a lot of reviews about this box set and it honestly made me really wary and ambivalent about buying it. But I realized that most of the people who wrote reviews about how terrible this box set was had already bought the movies when they came out. I, however, stopped buying the movies because I knew that something like this would come out eventually. And besides, the first two movies I had were on VHS. Old school, I know.

For someone who never had all the movies to begin with or who never bought them as they came out, this box set is absolutely fantastic. Not only did it come with all of the movies in regular DVD and Blu-ray, it also came with a cloth map of Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin's horcrux locket (which is an actual locket you can put things in), a book of Harry Potter artefacts, artwork, and a certificate telling you what number copy you have. Each movie has its own disk for special effects and the ""Creation of Harry Potter"", and there's a slip of paper hidden in the box set that gives you directions on how to download all of the movies onto your computer when you aren't able to bring the disks everywhere. I love the quality of the box set as well.

Nothing inside is made of crappy material whatsoever. I love this product and I'm going to make it a family heirloom. I would DEFINITELY recommend it to people who don't have the movies.",1352505600,19,1374,4.36328125

So far, I have made it through the first 4 films, watching ALLLLL The material that is included in each little ""book"" for each film. Each movie is packaged in it's own little book, which has a disc on each page. And I have not been disappointed. There are some real gems in there, and it has been amazing to watch! Basically, anything that's ever been aired on tv having to do with Harry Potter, plus tons of behind the scenes footage, interviews with cast, specials on how they trained the animals, made the musical scores, filmed the underwater scenes in the second task of the triwizard tournament, created the magical creatures, made the sets and costumes...I could go on. It's really very educational and VERY COOL.
The packaging is very well put together, and I literally squealed with joy upon opening all the little nooks and crannies in this sucker. There is soooo much cool collectible stuff in it. And it's all very high quality.  The box itself is quite hefty. It's bigger than it looks in the pictures you see on amazon. It's definitely something you'll have to make room for on your shelf, otherwise put in it's own place to be displayed, which is what I did.

5083369,4,B007FSEAHY,"This is a counterpoint to the reviewers who criticized the Harry Potter Wizard's Collection without actually buying one. I did buy the set.

Bottom line: It is a quality product. The box is sturdy and not as cheaply made as some reviewers claim. The ""collectibles"" do include some nice items, such as the cloth map of Hogwarts, the Noble Collection Horcrux Locket, concept art prints, and the catalogs of props and posters. There are several featurettes on the bonus discs that have not yet been released in other sets. Overall, it is a pretty comprehensive video collection and has some nice extras. Would I have liked to see something like the two wonderful collections sold on Amazon France with wooden cabinets and real collectibles? Of course, but both of those (the one with the Hogwarts Castle model and the other with the Elder Wand Display) are $350 EUROS (more than $450 dollars) and don't include a third of the disks you find in this collection. One of the French sets only comes with the first 6 films.

The Down Side: $350.00 is a bit steep for most buyers, but when you add up the value of everything it is a reasonable retail price. It would be a better value priced at $300 when compared to buying individual blu-ray sets of the films, and would probably get a lot more rave reviews instead of criticisms. The disks themselves are comprehensive and have all the film versions available elsewhere. There are no extended versions beyond the first two films, so that is not a valid point of criticism as the Directors and Producers never saw commercial value in that. Maybe they'll change their minds later, but considering how long ago HP3 was made, I wouldn't get my hopes up. The UltraViolet Digital Copy versions of the films is a straight up con-job/load of garbage from WB. It is a worthless system and other big filmakers like Disney opt for iTunes and other true downloaded copies for a reason. You need a fast internet streaming connection for the UV films and you can't take them with you. Most public WiFi is inadequate and you sure don't want to use cell networks to try and watch films like these on the road.

I certainly don't regret buying this set, and it got a lot of oooohs and aaaahs from everyone that saw it. If it were $50 cheaper and had true digital downloads of the films I would have given it 5 stars. As it is, the hard core Harry Potter fan does get good value for their investment.",1351382400,15,2425,4.570114942528735
5083370,4,B007FSEAHY,"I received the Harry Potter Wizard's Collection today and am already glad I made the purchase. After much thought, I finally decided to buy the set even though I already own all of the movies (only the last two on Blu-ray). There is no doubt that this set is expensive, but for hardcore fans of Harry Potter it is well worth the price tag. For what you are receiving, (including 31 disks, memorabilia, digital copies, and a beautiful case that holds it all)you really can't argue against the value. Additionally, since I was looking to upgrade my Potter movie collection to completely Blu-ray, this set was a no-brainer. Also, if you are considering buying this collection, don't be swayed by the people complaining about the price tag who haven't even purchased the item. Of course, not everyone can afford this high quality set, but if you can I would definitely recommend purchasing it.

Update: Experienced several skips while watching one of the films on Blu-ray. Proceeded to examine the disk and found a noticeable scratch which seemed to be the cause of the skips. Unfortunately, I found scratches on several more of the disks, prompting me to exchange the entire set. Hoping the new set will be free of scratches.

Update 2: I received my exchanged set in the mail yesterday. Of course, the first thing I did was check to see if any disks had scratches on them. Unfortunately, some disks did once again appear to have some scratches. However, these scratches were on fewer disks and don't seem to be as severe. So far, I have only tried watching one of the disks that had the most scratches on it and thankfully it did not experience any skips during it's play. Just wanted to warn people that if you purchase the set you are most likely going to get at least a couple of disks that are slightly damaged. Hope that this damage does not lead to any problems while watching the films.",1351123200,3,1891,4.641791044776119
5083371,1,B007FSEAHY,"Why spend $344 on a box set that includes discs we already own? A true wizard's collection would be in line with The Lord of the Rings.

5083372,4,B007FSEAHY,"Why are over 100 people reviewing the product if they don't actually have it? It is expensive yes but that's the appeal. If EVERYONE could afford it, every Potter fan would buy it, making it less special imo. I have this product and it is worth every penny.
If you break it down its actually not that bad. 20$ for each blu-Ray plus 10$ for each DVD, that's 240$. Plus the bonus disc for 20$ Plus the box for say 50$ (and the box is amazing with all it's compartments, looks beautiful displayed and good quality.) So far that's 310$ Add another say 50$ for all the extra little goodies and you are up to 360$ All of this packaged as a set with a limited amount made.
I will tell you that this is worth it if you are a fan. Sometimes you just gotta splurge on yourself once in a while if u really want something. If you cannot justify the price there are other smaller box sets out there. But it's getting tiring seeing all these ""reviews"" from people who are really just complaining about the price. Do that in a discussion forum.

My Review:
This is amazing! I was going back and forth about buying this for a while and I am so glad I did. The Box is amazing, The maps, booklets and horcrux are so great. I DO think it's a little crazy that they include the DVD and BluRay. I think They could have made it a tad cheaper if they split it up. But I can see some reasoning here. Many people still do not have BluRay so it makes sense to have DVD, but I can see in the near future BluRay taking over DVD the way DVD took over VHS... Who wants to pay hundreds on an item that will soon be obsolete. This way if you are one of the many people who still do not own a BluRay player you can still enjoy it now, and many years down the road when you are forced to get with the times. For Myself it's great as I have one TV with a DVD player and another TV with a PS3 for my BluRays.
The reason this item lost a star for me is because ALL of my discs had light scratches on them. Not enough to effect play but they should not have been there. Amazon.ca was wonderful at helping me out there and compensated me right away. Although, I was one of the Canadians that had a problem with the first disc. The disc plays as soon as you put it in the player and I have no menu options. I contacted WB quite a while ago and they told me when they have the correct first disc ready they will ship it to me. It has been weeks and I have heard nothing. Besides these problems I am pretty happy with my purchase.",1350950400,7,2488,4.016129032258065
5083373,5,B007FSEAHY,"If you're a hard-core HP fan, this deluxe box set is a must.  When I opened the outer box and pulled off the tissue paper, I was immediately taken by the graphics on the outside of the box.  Then I started opening it and was blown away by the attention paid to the overall design.  This box is sturdy and a joy to investigate, with all it's little drawers and secret compartments.  Instead of jewel cases or even paper sleeves, this set presents each movie in a case that resembles a book.  Each ""book"" contains the blu-ray, the dvd, the special features for that film, and a forth disc with extra goodies.  In all, there are 8 ""books"" in this set, as well as one additional hidden disc.  Among the other drawers and hidden compartments you'll find a fantastic collection of merchandise that you'll be excited to show off to friends.

The cases that the dvd's and Blu rays are in are very high quality and decorated really well with different movie scenes.
The separate compartments are a great way to store all the discs that you actually get - and you get heaps- I was most impressed with the certificate as it has the number on there and you feel pretty cool about knowing that you are 1 of 63 000 people in the world that possesses this amazing package.
I had read a lot of negative reviews before this set even came out and now that I have one all I can say is that if you are a collector of boxed sets you will know that they usually come out with only the dvd'd or blu rays - the fact that this set has all the extra things is a bonus and they are truly awesome from the sketches, the fabric map to the horcrux locket.

the set itself is really quite amazing to me. There is a top flap that layers over the corners that stays open when flipped up. exposing the first two movies. the movies are contained in a book-like container with lovely labels on it. the only flaw is that i wouldve liked if they had one of the push buttons to release the movie out of the book, inside you have to pop it out and it somewhat makes me nervous that it might break.
after the front face that is connected to the box by magnets is lowered, the box can be spread open to expose drawers containing more movies, along with three other compartments with bonus items inside. Three remaining drawers are at the bottom, might i add that the latches to the drawers are quite cute and despite being thin are pretty stable.
there is a bunch of other papers and booklets inside the drawers, one booklet being a catalogue for more harry potter items. the cool thing about this is that there is a list of the wands that shows you what they all look like. even if you weren't planning on buying some, it's cool to see.

I waited until the very end to buy the ultimate collections, hoping they would have a complete collection like this with all 8 parts to the ""Making of Harry Potter World"" series.  Unfortunatley, after watching the entire series, the 2nd disk (Characters), which comes in the ""Chamber of Secrets"" booklet is defective, with the sound cutting out throughout the disk. Amazon has been fantastic about sending me a replacement set, TWICE!  All three of the disk have had the exact same sound defect in the same places.  The manufacturing of this one disc is bad.  I think Amazon got a bad batch from Warner Brothers.  Amazon is aware of this, and looking into it. I LOVE the set, I just need a non-defective copy of this one disc.  Check your disk as well before your 30-day return time is up.  This would be a solid 5-stars if not for this defect.

5083394,4,B007FSEAHY,"First off, I LOVE this collection! The box is SUPER HUGE! It's almost as big as my 3 year old daughter NO JOKE! Second, I advise paying attention to reviews that were posted AFTER the set was released (September onward reviews). Also take note that people who actually PURCHASED It for the most par have fallen in love with this collection.

For those of you like me that have a blu ray player (all the bonus features are  on the blu ray discs), who have no use for the DVD versions ( I bought the DVDs every year), and who object to the price of this set ( I was surprised too): ""hop across the pond"" to amazon uk and buy it direct from Amazon there! Their discs have been fixed while Amazon US is currently under review.  Save yourself $100 bucks! You get the same set as the US release for much cheaper. The only caveat is  the DVD's ( which I don't need) will NOT work since they are region 2. The Blu rays are region free so those will work. If you HAVE to have the DVDs as well, then buy a region free DVD player with the $100 bucks you just saved  and still have leftovers in your wallet ; )

 Last but not least, I agree whole heartedly that NO ONE should review an item BEFORE its release. I hope my suggestions help some of you, if not I tried. I paid $250 USD and quite frankly, When I purchased this set the amazon price was 177 pounds. After adding item to my basket and going through checkout the price dropped to 148.13 pounds. Upon conversion of currency I paid $252.00 USD. Hope this helps!

Update one: 10-16-2012 defective disc deathly hallows part 2 blu ray

I'm watching Deathly Hallows part 2 blu ray and the quality SUCKS. You can barely see anything! It's too dark and full of pixels galore! The 3D discs are the ONLY ones that give you the same viewing quality I experienced at the theater.",1349740800,4,1815,4.23768115942029

I almost wonder if this set was priced by the pound. The box is huge.  When you consider you're getting all 8 movies.

I am so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews,  I  was almost startled when I opened the packaging....it is much bigger and impressive than it it looks in the pictures.  I could be wrong...but I thought this new packaging came out in Septmber..so reviews in March didn't make sense to me.  If you love the visuals of the movie..the feasts in the great hall, the quidditch matches and Diagon Alley, then you will love this.  It looks like (packaging wise) you walked into a shop in Diagon Alley to make the purchase.  The set is extraordinarily well made, with thoughtful and whimsical openings and drawers..well it's just visually stunning.  I loved the movies so much that I don't really care if there are multiple formats etc.  If you are looking for a spectacular way to have this classic in your home, then this is it.

5083406,3,B007FSEAHY,"This set is impressive - perhaps the nicest boxed set that I have seen for a movie series in a long time.  Unless you have just bought the bare-essential versions of the prior films, or none at all, it is also largely redundant. As someone who has bought the ultimate editions of these films (now, thankfully, Year 7 has now appeared) there is really no reason to buy this Wizards Set. The majority of the extras have already been released - at least, the ones that interest me have - and as others have noted, there are no extended versions to be found.

At this point, it seems pretty clear that there are no extended versions to release.  Adding in a bunch of deleted scenes, as was done essentially for the first two films, is not an extended version - it is an inferior version.  Absent a similar approach taken for Lord of the Rings, where extended versions were envisionned at the time of filming, the theatrical versions are all we will get. Those parts of the books that were dropped, were done so prior to the final script, so there aren't any substantial scenes (as far as I know) to add back in.

I didn't really know how to rate this set.  If it were the first deluxe set to appear, I'd have given it five stars; but it isn't. So, if you have bought the prior ultimate sets, no reason to also buy this one, and it gets one star.",1349136000,6,1341,4.301587301587301
5083407,5,B007FSEAHY,Best ever Harry Potter Collections although i really think WB should throw away 1 wand as well. For me it is worth it.,1349136000,5,118,4.173913043478261
5083408,5,B007FSEAHY,"Ok, forget all the negative reviews from people who have never seen this set or who have no plans to ever purchase it.  That's one of my pet peeves, is people who write a review about something they've not actually seen.

I just got this mammoth set in the mail last week, and let me tell you.........This is the MOST elaborate collection I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few as a movie collector over the years.  I must admit that I held off ordering this because of all the negative ""reviews"", but finally decided to sell all of my ultimate editions and then bite the bullet and get the Wizards collection.  The first thing you'll notice is that this is one solid piece of artwork.  After I cleared off my coffee table and got it out of the box, I just sat and admired the detail on the outer box, which is truly astounding.  Raised lettering, with gold gilding, and a feel of solid quality.  I raised the metal hinged top door which reveals the first year disc set.  Now these discs are housed in specially commissioned holders that were created just for this set.  They are quite unlike anything I've seen before.  You cold take all 8 out of the box and put them on a book shelf and they would look great.  Each one has its own design, which ties directly into the film.  The pages are of the thick foam type as seen in Alien Anthology, with the exception of the disc holders.  Each disc is attached to a specialized plastic hub that is recessed into the foam page, which means that when it's closed, you don't see any plastic edges, but instead it looks simply like a book that could be placed on a shelf.

After looking over the beautiful disc holder, I pulled on the front of the box, which is held closed with hidden magnets.  The front of the box then folds down and reveals what looks like an ornate travel trunk.  You then slide two sides out which then reveals several drawers with metal pulls on the front.  Each drawer holds more of the gorgeous books containing the discs, along with a lot of extra memorabilia.  After looking through all of the different goodies that are in each drawer, I was then left to start pushing and pulling on a few ""hidden"" compartments in the box.  I found a total of four secret areas housing; a scroll with UV codes for each film, a really pretty locket as is found in pt. one of the Deathly Hollows, a bonus blu-ray disc with over 3 hours of extra bonus features, and the final one containing a very nice cloth map, a paper map, and a hardcover art book.

One other note of interest, both parts of the Deathly Hollows include a 3D Blu-ray disc.  While I have to admit that pt. 1 practically has no real 3D effects, pt. 2 is much better in 3D.

OK, now I know this has a hefty price tag, but when you consider what you get in it, I think that what you get is well worth the cost.  This is a high quality set unlike anything I've seen before.  I think it's mainly cardboard, but this stuff could practically be used in construction it's so tough.  It is heavy, but it's also an item that has found a prominent place of display in my living room.  It truly is gorgeous, and well constructed.  Don't let all the negative ""reviews"" dissuade you as I did.  If you are able to lay down the money, I know you will NOT be disappointed with this set.  There is no need to ever have another release in the future, because this one is IT.  I just don't see how it could be any better.",1349049600,65,3424,4.263565891472868

5083415,1,B007FSEAHY,"This is a case of the studio milking the franchise and ripping off fans for every last cent they can get.... especially when you consider the age of some of these movies (the first Harry Potter movie was released 10 years ago in 2002) and the amount of revenue they have already generated.

Their business models show them that collectors will pay a premium for collectable editions.
And they are right; however, they have missed the mark on this one.

Look at the number of angry reviews relating to price. Also look at the fact that people are offended by a bloated dvd & blu ray presentation containing 31(!) discs, much of it duplicate material.

I have bought quite a bit from Amazon lately, and they have been excellent to deal with.
It is Warner Studios who is to blame here. A half price box set divided into separate blu ray and DVD editions would have won fans over in a heartbeat.

Shame on Warner for showing so much sheer contempt for their customers.
At this price, I would have expected all the major actors to have personally signed each and every box set.
And I would have expected a carved metal or wood box with real drawers.

After being so underwhelmed by this cheesy looking cardboard display, I went ahead and bought the used theatrical blu-ray versions of all these movies. They were in the clearance bin at a local store and cost me around $50 (less than one sixth of the price of this so-called collectors set).

Money talks. Buy this set and you encourage the type of predatory business practices that have screwed up our entire economy.
Stay away and the Warner studio executives will be forced to rethink what they are selling and come up with a superior product.
That is the way business works.

I will save my money and spend it elsewhere. The James Bond blu-ray set looks very tempting. So does the Alfred Hitchcock blu-ray set. They are older movies, but at least they have been remastered and restored properly.
Together, they add up to about the same price as this one unmagical Wizard Set.",1348790400,5,2025,4.577348066298343
5083416,1,B007FSEAHY,"My aunt showed me this awesome set and i was amazed. i asked my mum immediately and she then asked the price and i told her $350, she instantly said no as we are very strapped for cash. A month or two later i wrote up a contract stating i will do many chores around the house for a year on top of my other already existing chores as well as this being my birthday presents and Christmas presents for two years. I have been doing all these things just for this box set as i am an absolute potter head (a mega fan of harry potter). When my mother ordered this i cried (i usually don't cry about things). When it arrived i cried while opening it. I almost broke the packaging and box itself i was so excited. i looked through it all ecstatically and was so happy... that is until i came to the last bit. I found everything in order apart from the deathly hallows part 1 and 2 dvd's, blu-rays and extended cuts discs which in the drawer the discs should have been in there was nothing but a silicon packet to avoid moisture. Since there was no other packets of the sort i think amazon has made quite a big mistake. Seeing as i have anxiety you could imagine how stressful this was for me and my mother. When this was found my mother got straight on amazon as i told her i read another review that a lady received her box set and the map was missing so she sent it back and got a brand new one in days,(All expenses paid). Mum was on amazon and a rude unhelpful man was speaking to her expecting her to pay for AMAZON'S error. No fault of ours was the mistake yet he expected us to buy a whole new box set AND send back the set, why would we pay for TWO sets AND have to send one back, have we not bought the first one? We then have to pay shipping and which was over $220 so my mother who is a very reasonable woman then asked for his manager. Upon speaking to this man he told her that nothing could be done we would have to send the set back for a refund AND we had to pay shipping. As i said before we are very strapped for cash this is NOT good enough. We spoke to a few other people saying the same thing. My mum then emailed Warner brothers in Australia and instead of sending the missing discs (which they could not do) they apologized for AMAZON's mistake and sent some other special edition discs and documentaries of harry potter. We were pleased with the understanding Warner brothers showed and APPALLED by amazon and are never ever using amazon's service again. I am absolutely disgusted.",1348704000,7,2497,4.150515463917526

If you're paying this much money for a gift at least have the decency to provide full copies.

secondly, the ultraviolets are not available to anyone in australia! what a crock!

Also having read above comments, if you need a live stream, dvds can be converted anyway to be able to be watched on Ipad/ipod but don't advertise false material!

I love Harry potter movies but please at least be honest , all the other extras are great! but they blatently lied about the content and extra footage etc.

5083418,3,B007FSEAHY,"If you own the Blu-Ray ""Ultimate Editions"" for the first 6 films, all of the features and inclusions will be exactly the same.  The differences between the ""Ultimate Editions"" and this complete ""Wizards Collection"" is: the Wizards collection will have

1) 3-D copies of The Deathly Hallows, parts 1 & 2
2) A bonus disc with 4 hours of footage = ""Disc 31: Wizard's Collection Exclusive Bonus Disc (Blu-ray)""
3) Franchise memorabilia = a cloth map, blueprint of the Hogwarts castle, the Slytherin Horcrux Locket (worth $49 retail), miscellaneous artwork, potion & wizard product prop labels and Hogwarts Express ticket

This comes at price tag $100 higher than buying the Blu-Ray Ultimate Editions separately BUT if the things listed above are worth the extra hundred bucks, this will be worth it.

If you already own the first six Ultimate Editions (like I do!), you're going to spending a lot more overall...maybe reselling your Ultimate Edition copies will slightly offset the total cost??",1348272000,2,990,5.092592592592593
5083419,5,B007FSEAHY,"... I adore the packaging. I don't know why everyone complains about it. There is no deception in the description. If you thought you were getting extended editions of the other movies, or significantly more footage than found on the ultimate editions, you were delusional - no description promised that.

The only thing that would have been more awesome is the same set in actual wood. It's a slick design of folding sides, drawers with handles, secret compartments latched with magnets, etc. It's great fun. All my stuff was intact and shipped well, though I bought from wbshop, not amazon, which saved me all of $5, I think, after ebates and other discounts. woo-pee.

Did I already own all the blu-ray discs, 2 of which were the 'ultimate' editions of 1 & 2 with the extended scenes? Yes. So did I need to spend this much money on essentially re-buying all movies as ultimate editions? Of course not. But was it worth it? Totally. If you include having all the discs in one impressive package plus extras like the locket and cloth map etc. it was even or cheaper price-wise + the added bits and the collectors box make it worth 350 for fans. I love having packaging (inside and out) that is so fun - makes me feel like a kid again - and I appreciate the effort. How many other movies go this far? LoTR had some small statues, but that is about it. It's marketing, but it's good marketing.

Regarding re-buying discs / studios re-releases better sets every few years: I'll live. All studios release extra versions and I try to wait until the extended discs are out to save money on them... I had to re-buy most discs in blu-ray (since originally they were DVD), but that is my fault for not waiting. This is more of a collector's item as well, so I don't regret it. I am sort of waiting to buy LoTR on blu-ray for the same collector's box set... The truth is that going forward most of us will only buy digital and it will take awesome packages like this for us to bother even buying the hard-copy.",1348185600,5,2001,4.461748633879782

I figured I'd buy whatever Harry Potter set that came out, despite the fact that I already own all the films and bought them knowing there would be an ""ultimate"" set.

Now?  Forget it.  Tell ya what, knock 25% of the cost off and take out the normal DVD copies I have absolutely no need for, and I'll re-consider buying it.  Until then, Warner Bros can take their corporate greed and shove it.",1348099200,3,847,4.121951219512195

I know that one day this is going to be worth MUCH, MUCH more than what I paid for it!

5083424,1,B007FSEAHY,"When I pre-ordered this back in April, I was excited to get 31 discs of, in my opinion, the greatest film series of all time. But, when September came, I was crossing my fingers that I would get my copy, and on Tuesday, September 11th, I got it. Now, I have a habit on seeing the quality of the discs, so when I check all the discs, they were all scratched. So, I thought that I may of been the shipping that caused this, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement copy. When the replacement copy came yesterday, September 18th, I checked all the discs again, and they were scratched. So, I filled out another return request, and said that I wanted a refund for this flawed product. I was so enraged about this product, and when I checked back on Amazon about it, it went under review due to the number of complaints about the discs being scratched. I'm not going to try to get this a third time, because it's not worth it. All I'm going to do now is send the flawed replacement copy back, and hopefully get a full refund because I didn't spend over $350 for a failed product.",1348012800,5,1079,4.217391304347826
5083425,5,B007FSEAHY,"This product is highly expensive and some people think whether its worth it... when they have most or all of the movies on dvd anyway.
My recommendation is that people that haven't got all the movies or people that want these extra pieces of memorabilia such as the locket, huge map of hogwarts, huge blue prints, production sketches, art prints, new bonus material
and the never before released parts of making the world of harry potter.... that they should buy it. I mean... its worth it. I have movies 1-6 on dvd... and i'd like to have the full set with extra pieces here and there.
People that are just waiting for the ultimate editions as they already own enough of the editions... well it may or not come out... but in that case i suggest you don't get this if you don't want all of the exclusive memorabilia mentioned above.

Once again. It's worth it if you're a fan that wants more than the average fan, or if you don't all the movies/special features etc.
Not worth it if you've bought other editions and are just waiting for the last few.",1347926400,3,1050,4.46875
5083426,5,B007FSEAHY,"First of all, for the sake of full disclosure, the first set I received didn't include the cloth map or the Hogwarts blueprint poster.  I double checked with other online customers to make sure I wasn't missing a secret compartment somewhere, but they were well and truly missing.  Amazon was fantastic and made it super easy to return and replaced the set right away.  I got the replacement today with all of the items included, and it's perfect.

Now, for the reason I believe it's worth the price.  I became a Harry Potter fan kind of late, and I never bought any of the Ultimate Editions.  At that point, I decided to hold off because I knew that Warner Bros. would release a box set because that's what always happens.  The discs included in the Wizard's Collection are essentially the Ultimate Editions packaged together.  If you look at the prices for the Ultimate Edition Blu-rays, they run between $32 - $39 each (except for Deathly Hallows parts 1 & 2, which haven't been released yet).  If you bought each of them individually, it would be at least $285.

Then, you have the Noble Collection Slytherin locket which retails for $49.  Already, the total is at $334.

Once the other extras are added in -- the gorgeous cloth map, the blueprint poster, the Stuart Craig art and concept paintings (both which are stunning and begging to be framed and displayed), the book of labels, and the Catalogue of Artefacts -- they all add up really fast.  And the packaging is top notch.

I know it's a lot to shell out at one time, and not everyone has it.  I do sympathize with that because there have been plenty of times in my life when I've not been able to indulge.  But no one can say it's not worth that much because if each of these things were bought separately, it would actually add up to costing more.",1347840000,8,1811,4.50920245398773
5083427,3,B007FSEAHY,"I ordered this set about 10 days ago. I was extremely excited when it came in, despite the fact that the box it came in was severely damaged. Luckily it was just the outer box that was messed up and not any of the other packaging it came in. I could care less about the DVDs since I only like to watch blu-ray, but all my DVDs were scratched when I got them and some of the Blu-rays were smudged. I expected the movies to have perfect HD picture and sound, of course this wasn't the case. A lot of them looked as if they were DVD quality put onto a blu-ray disc with no HD conversion whatsoever. As for the final film in the collection, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2,"" I got to the scene where Harry is back at Hogwarts, facing professor Snape in the Great Hall. As Snape pulls out his wand Professor McGonagall steps in front of Harry and starts casting spells at Snape, right after she casts the spell for a second time the movie skips to where everyone is all standing around cheering and Snape is no where to be found. What happened to the rest of the scene? Was it cut out? It didn't appear to be, it looked like the disc was scratched or needed to be cleaned, so I took the disc out, wiped it down and tried it again. I ran into the same issue! I then turned on the display to see how much time had be lost, during the playback, if it was just a couple of seconds or if a big chunk of minutes were missing. The display said I was 37 minutes and 26 seconds into the film, I left the display on and played from the scene I mentioned above, it skipped and the display read 37 minutes and 27 seconds. How could this be? I assumed it was an issue Warner Brothers had copying the film to the disc. So I immediately contacted Amazon that the disc was defective and they offered to replace the whole set. I don't know if this was such a good idea because other than the video quality issue, I had no other problems with any of the other blu-ray discs. I should have just contacted Warner Bros and asked them to replace the one faulty disc. Oh well, a bit late for that, we shall see what happens when the new set comes in. All in all I would give this a 3 star rating simply because it had its ups and downs. If like me, you waited until all the films were complete to purchase a huge box set (which everyone knew would happen one day) it is worth the price, yes the video quality wasn't the best, but I don't see it getting better any time soon. The digital copy thing was another issue that upset me, but I'll live, it's not a necessity in my eyes. If you had the money to spend on this collection, and you don't previously own any of the films I would recommend buying this set, and if you run into any issues as I did, GET WARNER BROTHERS TO RESOLVE THEM A.S.A.P.!!!",1347840000,8,2783,4.0989010989010985
5083428,5,B007FSEAHY,"As one of the people reviewing the product after actually RECEIVING IT [unlike those who have reviewed it before its release!], I have to say that this is a positively GORGEOUS blu ray collector's set !!!

As it was I could view less than half of the discs.  Had I been aware of this I would not have purchased the collection.  Amazon is very good about returns but I decided to give the collection to friends.,1347753600,,350,4.257575757575758

5083431,2,B007FSEAHY,"I was so terribly excited to get this! I opened the box and it was so wonderfully put together that I got excited! Then I started watching everything. The first six movie sets are really just the six special sets they have put out in the past. Really nothing new there. Then came the last two movies. They finished the ""special set"" with the rest of the information they have always said they would have. However, there is so much repeat information it's disgusting! Over and over they will discuss the same exact thing, topic, or situation. It's not even presented in a different way. Just the same material three and four times repeated.
  Then there's the TV shows that we have seen on TV over the years. They didn't even bother to cut out the ""when we return"" prior to a commercial on TV, quickly followed by the ""now that we have returned"" beginning following the commercials. Really? You couldn't take the two extra seconds to cut those out? It was ridiculous watching them pop up over and over.
  Now let's talk about mistakes! There are a few in there. A perfect example is during the top 50 series on the bonus disc. When you get to the Quidditch section they show a series of scenes that show Harry and Draco filming and fighting for the snitch. However, the label under the section says it's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone. Any Potter fan willing to pay this money is going to know that it is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This is simple double checking folks. Really, it's a matter of professionalism.
  The digital copy is a complete joke. When I here ""digital copy"" that means to me there is a way for me to put these movies on my tablet, laptop, whatever, that I can take anywhere with me to watch with my children. Not what I got! This is a web location I have to go on the internet, sign up for a new service (have to, no choice! If you don't, you won't get the movies!), and watch via the internet in a live feed. What happens when I move out of internet range in my ""remote area""? No movies! Ridiculous! Warner Brother's, shame on you! This was just a way to sneak my money!
  Let's talk one last topic. The certificates. It clearly states that mine is 17,242 of 63,000. What does that truly mean? I ask because I have friends that have them across the world. One has # 47,463. He ordered his back in May/June (mine was March). Now, just following simple math, there is no way possible that there should be any of the 63,000 left to sell currently! How is it possible these are still on sale? Carrying this further, there are MILLIONS of Potter fans. Do you mean to tell me there are only 63,000 worldwide and they haven't sold out already???? Really? Does this mean there are 63,000 per country/group? I can't even believe there would be any left of that total in the United States, let along in the world. Can you, JK Rowling, really stand by and know that there is no way possible for this to happen, yet allow it anyway? I thought better of you! I have loved how you have stood your ground and insisted these books (and after products) have stayed true. Is it staying true to allow this particular lie? I am appalled! Just how many of these box sets are there really?
  In closing, while I am not willing to return this set, I am also so very disappointed that I bought the set. It was a wedding anniversary from my husband, so not a returnable item. I just wish that the spirit in which he gave to me was even closely met by this set. It is nothing more than a complete repeat of already purchased material. The ""new"" things are even mostly repeat information from somewhere else in the set. I watched these nonstop over the last week so I had lots of immediate comparisons to make. How sad! I have lost a great deal of respect for JK Rowling and Warner Brothers. Is that bonus disc and the last two movies of the ""special set"" really worth this price? No. Unless the extra items are hand signed or some how otherwise special, are they worth the price? No. If I was some one reading this, I would wait for the price to drop. It is sure to once people realize what this set really is- just more money.",1347753600,6,4158,4.3604651162790695

Today I decided to watch the first part of the 8-part documentary.
I put the disc to play on my blu-ray disc player and...""Disc Error"".
I take it off, put it in again, and...""Disc Error"".
Starting to get nervous, I try the blu-ray disc of the first movie, and it works just fine.
Looking at the recording side of the disc, I noticed that all the documentary discs (except for the last one)and the bonus disc didn't have anything marked, while the discs of the movies (the ones that worked, I mean) showed that characteristical coloured pattern when under the light.
Apparently, the documentary discs came empty.
I'll try to contact Warner Bros. and ask for a replacement.
I really hope they solve this problem as quickly as possible.

Sicerely,

A disappointed fan

I just realized I never posted the resolution of my problem, so...
Amazon sent me a whole new collection, the discs worked fine and I returned the first box back to them. They were really nice at trying to solve this whole situation.
I contacted Warner Bros. too, when I was still trying to find a way to solve everything, and they sent me a set of the discs that weren't working, so now I actually have extra copies :P

So, in the end, everything is fine, I'm happy with my collection and both companies (Amazon and Warner) were really helpful and effective in fixing the problem :)",1347580800,2,1618,5.067669172932331
5083435,5,B007FSEAHY,"I'm a movie collector, and I own some of the greatest box sets available.  The BestBuy Exclusive Ben-Hur set, Alien Anthology Egg Edition, LOST Complete Series, Walking Dead Season 2 Limited Edition, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Limited Edition, and even the Scarface Humidor Edition.  And I can say this with no reservation at all: Harry Potter: Wizard's Collection is by far the nicest box set I've ever seen.  Nothing else even touches it.  The only ones that even come close are LOST (in terms of cool packaging) and Scarface (in terms of quality).  And honestly, even those aren't really a contest.

It's all been said already.  This set is gigantic, weighs a ton, and is unbelievably nice.  The quality of the box is unmatched.  Super-heavy-duty cardboard material covered in some kind of faux leather.  I was blown away by how solid the construction is.  The books that hold the discs are extremely nice.  The locket is really cool, as are the booklets, and pictures.  The ONLY thing I was slightly disappointed in was the cloth map.  The image seems kinda washed out and faded; I feel like they could have done it better.

I know there is a lot of controversy about the price, and I understand that, as I had to shuffle some things around to be able to afford this.  But I disagree with everyone out there that gave this set a bad review based on the price, for two reasons.  1) If you can't afford it... don't buy it.  2) Quality-wise, this set really is worth every penny.

If it's within your means to buy this set (and you have room in your house for it, haha), you really should.  You will be thrilled with it.",1347580800,5,1626,4.52233676975945
5083436,4,B007FSEAHY,"12-03-12: Update - **Caution**  Please note that this collection only has a 30-day return policy!  That means if one of your Blu-ray discs or DVDs is defective, you can't get a replacement after 30 days.  (If you ask me, it's pretty unreasonable to expect a buyer to watch 30 discs that quickly!)

Despite all the negative reviews (by people who hadn't actually seen the collection ""in person,"" by the way), I decided I had to have one of these.  I'm very pleased with it.  Yes, the box isn't wood - but it's extremely heavy, multi-layered cardboard.  The packaging for each year's videos is particularly nice, with very heavy multi-layered fiberboard 'pages' between the media discs (think of a child's board-book, but with quite thick pages).  The box, itself, is quite large, and nicely done.  Overall, it's a high-quality product.

My main disappointment was the label collection.  When the description said it was a 'label collection,' silly me, I expected a collection of labels (like actual labels).  Instead, it's a pamphlet containing photographs of the various labels.  Interesting, but not as much fun as if they'd actually been labels.

Nevertheless, I'm happy I added this collection to my Harry Potter memorabilia.  Having seen it, I would order it again.",1347580800,3,1269,5.033653846153846

I love the documentary, the bonus disc, the cloth map, and the necklace! Is it worth $350? Maybe not, depends on how big a fan you are. Didn't stop me from dropping the money.",1347494400,3,336,4.349206349206349
5083438,3,B007FSEAHY,"I didn't realize just what I was ordering when I put in for this thing, over $340 for yet another set of DVD,'s- who among us needs that?  I'm after the blu-ray copies and, hopefully some new extras ( over the years like so many others I've bought the "" better"" 2 disc DVD sets all along). Yet another DVD collection very few will need, a fancy display case and several knick knacks along with the blu rays, what a way to drive up the price!
If I could really be sure that 6-8 months from now this set would be 50% off I'd have waited, but what if if it sells out quickly in spite of the cost? I think a lot of people won't take that chance and will spend a lot of wasted money.
What the Potter fans really need is a bare bones Blu ray set, too bad gouging rules all. The movies were pretty good even if they didn't always follow the books, I for one would sure appreciate getting what I really want without useless extra DVD's and other, probably Chinese made, toys.",1347494400,,967,4.116402116402116

5083442,5,B007FSEAHY,"This is NOT a ""cardboard box."" The packaging is absolutely beautiful, designed by MinaLima (the graphic artists who did all eight movies). Besides the 31 discs, there are lots of great little extras inside. My favorites:

 - A Noble Collection Slytherin locket, which by itself retails for $50.

 - A map of the Hogwarts castle and grounds, which is painted onto a thick fabric, and has hanging hooks on the back. When hung on a wall, it looks like a tapestry. Very cool.

 - I know all those Ultimate Editions contain what they call ""frameable artwork,"" but it's usually sketches of dragons or something that no one over the age of eighteen would ever want to hang on a wall. But this package did in fact include stunning, full-color artwork of things that the average Potterhead would actually WANT to frame, such as the Hogwarts castle from several different views. There were also gorgeous sketches by Stuart Craig of the castle, the graveyard, and Diagon Alley that are just begging to be framed; I don't have enough wall space to hang it all! This is the first time I've seen any ""artwork"" that I would truly consider ""art"" and not just ""movie promotional stuff.""

 - The box is outstanding. There are lots of weird little drawers and hidden compartments. Some of the drawers have little gold handles, others don't. To open the ones without the handles you press in, and some device behind the drawer makes it pop out. I was not at all expecting that type of quality, since some of the other reviewers said this was just ""a cardboard box."" It isn't. Cardboard couldn't hold this thing, as it weighs a ton, and I had trouble lifting the box. No, it isn't wood, but it's certainly not a crappy piece of cardboard.

 - A book of labels full of potions and Weasley products that is really beautiful and full of detail. They were selling sticker books last Xmas for $30 that weren't half as beautiful as this.

There were, of course, other books, posters, and cool things, not to mention the discs themselves, but I just really didn't expect it to be quite this well done, especially after reading so many of the bad reviews. I felt that it was well worth the price. I suppose if you already own all the Ultimate Edition Blu-Rays then you may not want to repurchase them just to get this box, but I absolutely LOVED this packaging and thought it was gorgeous.

5083447,5,B007FSEAHY,"I see a lot of negative reviews on here none of which appear to be from people who have acually purchased this product. I did purchase it, it arrived today and I am one VERY happy customer.

I have only two complaints but I'm still giving the product 5 stars because in all fairness they aren't that big of a deal and easy to solve. 1) a lot of the extra content as well as the two 3D movies (7 part 1 and 7 part 2) are on blu-ray only and I don't have a blu-ray player... no big deal it's time I catch up to the rest of the movie watching world and go get one. 2) It does not come with 3D glasses... again no big deal those are easy to come by.

Now for all the MANY positives the box itself is a super cool box very nice to have on display with puzzle like drawers and compartments hiding all sorts of trinkets and treasures. The scetches and artwork that comes with the set are frame worthy and I would easily pay 30-50 for those alone. Slythern's locket is super cool and looks just like it does in the movie. It has complete DVD, Blu-Ray, and special features disks for all 8 movies as well as 3D of both Deathly Hallows movies.

As another review stated if you bought just the complete set of movies with special features and blu-ray alone you would spend maybe 50-100 dollars less add in all the other collector items included and try to put the set together for less than $350 and I doubt you could do it. I agonized over the decision to buy this, several years ago I bought the collectors edition 7th book in a fancy box that was supposed to have cool added illustrations and was sorely dissapointed. However I had stopped buying the movies after the 4th one knowing one day something like this would come and I'd want them all together in a complete set. Not only am I not the least bit dissapointed in this set but it is even cooler than I expected it to be and my wife (who is NOT a Harry Potter fan at all) says she too is seriously impressed and does not regret us agreeing to make this investment.

As for the complaints on the digital copy (again from someone who does not appear to have purchased this at all) everything appears to be in order on that I have not tried it yet and will ammend this review if I'm wrong but it looks like any other digital copy download I have gotten in the past from movies.",1347235200,9,2322,4.14190687361419
5083448,5,B007FSEAHY,"This set is absolutely awesome. If you're a huge fan like I am, especially if you haven't bought any of the ultimate editions yet, this set is absolutely worth the money.

The box itself is beautiful and super fun to try to find all the hidden crevices. Like someone else said in their review, at first I was worried that I did not receive a few of the included items, but it just turns out that they were very well hidden inside this amazing box.

The horcrux locket included is fabulous, as are all the other goodies included. It's all beautiful and very well done.

Seriously, if you have the money and you want a really nice, complete set. Buy this. It won't disappoint.

Edit: I've now had this set for a while and I'm still just as glad that I bought it. All the special features, especially the eight-part documentary are excellent and fascinating.",1347235200,9,855,4.496774193548387
5083449,5,B007FSEAHY,"Super artistic and creative presentation of a very fine movie series for all ages. This  product represents the hard work of the graphic designers, engineers, printer, the patience of workers assembling 63000 of these sets all for Harry Potter fans ! Anyone would be proud to show this wonderful product from Warner Brothers to their friends and fellow HP fans. It's an incredible product and hope those interested manage to purchase there own  before there all gone.",1347235200,7,467,5.0519480519480515
5083450,5,B007FSEAHY,"I received the Wizard's edition today. It was everything I hoped for and needed. We only had purchased the regular Harry Potter dvds,and none of the special editions up to this point. I realized a long time ago, when the first movie was in the theater, that this would be coming in the future and waited for it ( I feel the same will be coming with the two Hobbit movies and the Lords of the Ring trilogy are put together in a boxed set). The Harry Potter Wizard's set was very nicely packaged for post. The cabinet itself, is just like others have written,just a beautiful artistically engineered wonder to hold the dvds and the special contents within.  This will be a great addition to all my Harry Potter,first printing books, signed books,dolls and artwork.

Thanks J.K.Rowling, all the great actors in all of the Harry Potter movies, Mary Grandpre and Warner Brothers for this total package of entertainment. I wll certainly enjoy the Harry Potter movies and this boxed set for the rest of my life.",1347235200,7,1004,4.634831460674158
5083451,5,B007FSEAHY,"Worth every penny!  Keep in mind, I never bought the DVDs.  I knew eventually there would be a massive set so that I didn't have to re-buy anything. The packaging is amazing and very well-constructed.  In my opinion, the best-part of the set is the cloth map.",1347235200,8,259,4.468085106382978
5083452,5,B007FSEAHY,"When reading the reviews here, I almost didn't buy it.  That said, I would guess many who reviewed it here haven't purchased the collection.  Watching the video about it caused me to change my mind, and my huge, heavy box arrived today.  The box design is great.  The included items are treasures for HP collectors.  That said, I know not everyone can afford such a purchase.  Those who can may not make it a priority.  Still, for those who can afford it, watch the You Tube video about it with cast members.",1347235200,8,508,4.456521739130435
5083453,4,B007FSEAHY,"I'll not waste your time with what's included in this set and what is not.  Other reviewers have listed it all out, and very nicely at that.  I'll also not waste your time bemoaning the price.  It is what it is, and you're going to know whether or not you can afford it.  What I will do is give you the three-point twist of a true Harry Potter geek.

1.  The cardboard case.  It is covered boxboard, a paper product.  It's pretty sturdy.  An adult geek/collector will not have a problem keeping this in great shape.  If you got this to play the discs over and over, you should have gotten the 8 disc Ultimates set.

Also to note - this is a big, big box.  While it's box-shaped, making it easier to store, it's not going to fit on your Blu-Ray shelf.  It may not fit in your entertainment center either.

2. Extras.  The extras are everything here, and I don't mean the extra scenes/documentaries.  The map is nice, but no better than you can find on several web sites.  The production sketches are beautiful, and great quality.  The label portfolio is so fun! I love it, even though it's not a high-quality item.  Best of all is the Horcrux locket.  It's gorgeous.  I wish it was made of silver, rather than a base metal, but this was the piece that put me in the pre-order category.  This piece meets my expectations (even at a limited edition this is a mass-produced item), where the sketches exceeded my expectations.

3. Digital copy.  The digital copy is available through UltraViolet, which kind of makes me mad.  I think I'll download it and save to my PC, but I hate having to sign up for UV to do it.

I'm happy with this overall, and I would pay the sale price again if I had to do it all over.  I am a HUGE HP geek, so your mileage may vary.",1347235200,5,1753,4.249240121580547
5083454,1,B007FSEAHY,I was so excited for this as I thought WB was finally releasing the set that we've all been waiting for. TONS of extra footage! ALL the extended editions! Then I get on here to read reviews certain to see at least 4.5 stars and see that it's got nothing new but a bunch of junk in it?? I'm severely disappointed. And the price is just LAUGHABLE. Utter FAILURE.,1347235200,3,360,4.231884057971015
5083455,5,B007FSEAHY,"I was hesitant to purchase this due to the price, but am glad I did. I did not purchase any of the movies on blu-ray previously because I knew there would be a collector's edition eventually. So for me, this was a good purchase. I get all the movies on blu-ray plus there's lots of extras all in a good quality box. If you've previously bought the movies on blu-ray, then just wait a month or two and they plan on releasing the last two movies as ultimate editions so you can round out your set.",1347235200,5,495,4.166666666666667
5083456,5,B007FSEAHY,"Both my wife and I are big Potter fans. And we agree that this comprehensive set is great, even thought it won't fit on our video shelves. The box itself is an excellent piece: well constructed and interestingly designed. And wile we've only watched 6 disks so far, we are very happy that we got it. The disks are well done and the extras are quite nice also. My recommendation: get one if you still can!",1347235200,8,404,4.328947368421052
5083457,5,B007FSEAHY,"Just received my package today. Wow! This thing is huge and heavy. When I pulled it out of the box, I was seriously impressed by the quality. It looks and feels, like a leather bound case. Very thick and sturdy. Metal hinges and metal drawer pulls. Extremely well built and impressive. The discs are in thick book like containers, in pull out drawers, lined with black velvet linings. I was trying to be so gentle and careful as I explored this beautiful set. At first I was so excited but then noticed I had not found all of the items yet. Where are the maps, book and special bonus disc at? But I then realized that this beautiful case holds secrets of its own. Magical secret compartments. Oooohhhh! The first secret compartment wasn't too difficult to find. It contained the maps, and book. But where is the bonus disc hidden? I started emptying the drawers, looking under the black velvet linings. Nope, not there. Examined the lid, nope, examined the front lid that lays flat, nope. Under case, nope. But then I found it! Brilliantly hidden! I pulled it out and there was the bonus disc. Finding and exploring this case to find the hidden compartments was just brilliant. I'm not going to tell you, just where, exactly they're hidden. That's for you to find out for yourself and have fun doing so. I waited all these years, because I just knew a massive collection would be released. And now I finally have it. Any Harry Potter fan would be thrilled to own this. Glad I waited, it was totally worth it. 50 points to Gryffindor!",1347062400,58,1533,4.557971014492754
5083458,5,B007FSEAHY,"There is a lot of controversy surrounding the Wizard's Collection from the Harry Potter fan community. The facts that every buyer should know before buying is that this set collects the previous 6 Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray releases of the films. New content in this set are the final 2 Ultimate Editions (which have yet to be released separately) and an exclusive bonus disc (this amounts to 10 new hours of content). Eventually, the only disc that will be exclusive to this set is that 4-hour bonus disc. All other content either has been or will be released separately. The disc breakdown is all 8 Blu-Ray discs of the films, 8 DVD discs of the films, 2 Blu-Ray 3D discs of Deathly Hallows, 4 discs of bonus features exclusive to DVD, and 9 discs of bonus features exclusive to Blu-Ray.

All of the contents are housed in one of the most beautiful boxes you have ever seen, which is very sturdy and well themed (even the inside of the drawers are themed). The discs are all housed in sturdy books with plastic treys for each disc. The art of each book is designed after some of the text books Hogwarts students use in each film. These are housed in the bigger drawers, except for the bonus disc which is hidden in the back of the box. A compartment lifts up on top to reveal a book called Catalogue of Artifacts, which presents some of the best props in the film in photo detail. A blu-print of the layout of Hogwarts as seen in the final film is in this compartment, as well as a beautiful cloth map of Hogwarts and the surrounding areas (it comes with care instructions in case you want to hang it). A drawer towards the bottom of the set holds 5 sketches by Stuart Craig and another book called The Label Collection, which is full of graphics designed for Wizarding World products such as Pumpkin Juice and potion bottles. The bottom drawer contains an individually numbered certificate of authenticity, 8 concept art prints (1 from each film) a catalogue for the Noble Collection's Harry Potter products, and a brochure for the Harry Potter Studio Tour in London. Two spring-loaded drawers contain a roll of parchment containing a code to claim your Ultra-Violet streaming copies and the other contains the horcrux locket replica.

Pros: The set gorgeously collects all 8 films and rounds up every bonus feature ever made for these films. The package is beautiful and the quality of the extra goodies are well made. This set truly feels like something special that you will cherish for a long time.

Cons: The price is high, but if you are a diehard fan and want all of the content/goodies, it's worth it. If not, there are cheaper ways to own all 8 films and that is the route I would recommend to anyone who isn't an extreme Harry Potter fan.",1347062400,18,2749,4.583333333333333
5083459,5,B007FSEAHY,"I'm so sad!  I ordered this with great expectation and eagerly opened it when it arrived to find that the map of hogwarts and surrounding areas, the artifact book and the blue print of hogwarts were not inside.  I immediately contacted Amazon and they called me and resent the item YAY!  BUT alas!!! the set again did not include the map, blueprint and artifacts book....WB is sold out and the customer service rep said that it is out of stock for Amazon; that the whole batch is missing these items....I hope this problem can be fixed and i can have the *complete* set I paid for...now I have to return 2 HP sets.

5083460,5,B007FSEAHY,"The Harry Potter Wizard's Collection is amazing. It seemed kind of pricey to me at first, but upon arrival I realized that it is worth it! The case itself is huge and has a leather feel on the outside. It is modeled like a trunk from HP. There are five drawers and three other cleverly concealed openings inside. Each movie and beautiful design on each book like case. I also like that there is a bonus DVD as well. There is a cute scroll with a code to get digital copies of each movie. I did not realize this upon ordering, but you also receive a Noble Collection horcrux necklace. The necklace alone sells for fifty bucks at noblecollection.com. Basically this set is amazing! There are the movies in blu-ray and DVD as well as hours of special features and behind the scenes. I like the extras as well. The labels book and prop book are very interesting and nice quality. I loved the large cloth map of Hogwarts and surrounding areas and the sketches/art prints. I recommend this set as it is unique and limited edition. (You can ignore reviews for this from before September 7th since that is when the collection was released. I preordered and received my set on September 7th).",1347062400,44,1183,4.5327102803738315
5083461,5,B007FSEAHY,"**UPDATE #3** Amazon came through and the new collection was on my doorstep in only a couple of days. I checked all the discs and while a few had minor hairline scratches, there was none of the extreme damage seen on the original set. The second set they sent is in better condition and not at all dirty, dusty, and damaged like the first one. (Maybe the first one we received was made on a Monday by a Muggle who was tired of make thousands of these collections.) We've had an opportunity to watch the first two films in the Extended Edition presentation, as well as view portions of the extras included. So far we are very impressed and delighted we invested in this Collection. Again, other than the issue with the quality control on our first set, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone that is a die hard Harry Potter fan. After seeing this collection, and watching the first part of the 'Making of' series it is apparent that all those involved in bringing these wonderful books to life are truly passionate artists who deserve to be rewarded for their efforts. People complaining about the cost of this set need to understand the level of complexity and attention to detail involved. In reality it breaks down to around $34 a movie, and given the extras and the box itself - I consider it well worth it! I'd have paid ten Galleons more!

**UPDATE #2*** Amazon was quick to dispatch a replacement set. It is slated to be shipped via 1 day delivery. I will update again once the new Collection is here to see if the damage is limited to only a few sets. Thanks Amazon for responding so quickly and getting a replacement out ASAP. NOTE: I highly recommend anyone who owns this set to CHECK EVERY DISC NOW!

Placing score at Three Stars, and will return to Five Stars once the new set arrives and the condition of the discs is acceptable.

***UPDATE*** Lowered Review to 1 Star due to Quality Issues with Discs - All my discs are damaged and based on other reviews, this is not an isolated incident.

***Original Review***
Owl Post just delivered the 24 pounds of Harry Potter goodness to my front steps. After lugging it indoors,(my wand was not at the ready, or I would have used 'Wingardium Leviosa')and upon opening the box, I was immediately taken aback by the sheer size of it. The quality of the materials used was far greater than anything you would expect, given all the horrible reviews by people who have never even seen this set. It was an intoxicating combination of the texture, feel, and smell of the collection that overwhelmed us. We took our time and slowly explored each door, panel, and secret compartment. As each new object was discovered, and passed around to be admired, the room was filled with 'OOoos and Aaahhhs'. I'll admit after being very excited initially upon ordering the Collection, I did get concerned when I started reading all the negative reviews. While it is true, this set is expensive, I will have to say anyone who purchases it will not be disappointed. We have been blown away at the level of quality and attention to detail. And we haven't even begun to enjoy the movies and all the extra content, but I wanted to login and leave a review. I'll update this later with more information as we explore deeper in the collection. We are looking forward to taking our time and enjoying every ounce and every minute of this Collection. Please do not let the negative reviews, written by Muggles who've never even seen the Collection, dissuade you from purchasing it. Cheers!",1347062400,10,3524,4.606687898089172
5083462,5,B007FSEAHY,"I pre-ordered this because, despite being a massive Potter fan, I realized I didn't own any of the films, and hadn't even seen the last 2 films when they were in theaters. There were a few things that tipped this product into my favor:

- Multiple formats including Bluray and Digital Download which is very important to me.
- Extended versions with extra scenes.
- Cohesive look through the whole set.

Now, I fretted a bit when I was afraid that it would be a cheap, flimsy box, that I was paying extra just for the ""novelty"". I received my set yesterday but didn't open it til this morning and let me reassure you, it was worth every penny!

It comes packaged very safely - the brown inner box is tucked into an outer case and buffered with styrofoam - the outer case itself is nice though of a thinner cardboard, has very nice poster-art type pictures on it and states the included features.

The real show stopper is the box set itself. It's made of a thick, durable cardboard with a nice faux-leather effect on the outside. This is a set I am already proudly displaying on a shelf.

Inside, the attention to detail is very impressive - the items are all in plastic trays inside the individual drawers, but if you take out the tray, each drawer even has decorative illustrations so no part of the box ""looks ugly"" - even the parts you are unlikely to see!

The small cases that each hold one film (1,2,3,4,5,6, 7 Part I and 7 Part II) are thick cardboard ""books"" - think baby picture books. The discs have art on them that matches each of their ""book"" cases, and each ""book"" has an individual style that complements the tone of that film. They include stills from each film as well, overall presenting a very nice container, much nicer than any set I've looked at before now.

There are also included the bonus feature discs, and a Documentary about the making of the film series. Having never seen any of this content I am very excited and look forward to over 40 hours (including the films) of entertainment. I'm even planning a viewing party with my friends!

All of the extras are lovely, things I will treasure and enjoy. My favorite out of all is the sturdy fabric ""tapestry"" that shows notable locations. I already want to frame it and hang it on the wall! It even includes care instructions so you are sure to care and cherish this item for many years.

Overall, I am exceedingly thrilled with this purchase and I encourage you to get your own before they run out! It's a limited run of 64,000. My number was around the 13,500 range and I pre-ordered only 2 days before it was released.",1347062400,22,2599,4.454736842105263
5083463,5,B007FSEAHY,"I have always loved the Harry Potter series (both the books and the films) but I had never owned any of the movies. When this was announced, even despite the seemingly absurd price, I thought I would go for it, as I wanted to own the entire series and thought the extra stuff might be neat. I was not prepared for how this set would turn out.

When it arrived at my house I was taken aback by how massive the box was. I was expecting a large collection, but nothing I had imagined came close to the sheer size of this thing! The way the collection is designed is almost like a pop-up book in that as you open the box more elements fold out, pop up, or otherwise reveal themselves. Half the fun of this set is simply exploring all the nooks and crannies of this cavernous set. And the exploration is definitely rewarding. Obviously you have the 31-Discs of the set, containing the films, all previously released bonus features, and some brand new content; but the set also contains some cool artwork from the films including a couple books featuring pictures of many of the props and labels from the film series, a set of 5""x7"" concept sketches, and 8 framable lithographs. Not to mention the cloth map of Hogwarts and its surroundings, a blueprint of Hogwarts Castle as used in the films, and, my personal favorite, a replica of the Slytherin Locket courtesy of The Noble Collection.

At a glance the price seems to be outrageous, but after getting my hands on this set, I can say it is well worth the cost. It's solidly made, and contains an impressive amount of extras. I was skeptical about the set, but it completely blew me away. If you're a die-hard fan of the series and/or you don't own any or most of the movies, I'd say this is definitely worth a look.",1346976000,26,1762,4.418461538461538
5083464,5,B007FSEAHY,"Despite many of the reviews claiming this set does not have the extended Blu-Rays ... this set does, in fact, have the extended version on the Blu-Rays. It's honestly an amazing set in an incredible package.  But be warned, it's a HUGE box. It's about 16-18"" high and 12"" square at the base. It opens at the top and then folds down to reveal several drawers. Each movie has a Blu-Ray, a DVD, a special features and a Making the Magic of Blu-Ray. (Well, there's 31 discs, so one only has Blu-Ray, DVD and Making the Magic of.) There's a tapestry, the Slytherin necklace, a map and tons more, including ""secret"" drawers.

This set was released in September of 2012 - reviews older than that should be looked upon skeptically. I've just started watching the extended versions - so far it's quite enjoyable.

GREAT set!",1346976000,8,815,4.606896551724138
5083465,5,B007FSEAHY,"Not only is this set absolutely a delightful pain to carry, but it has so many bells and whistles that it's practically the room of requirement! I redeemed my UV digital copy, and it's SD on Flixster. However, if you have a VUDU account, it is in HDX!

Oh, and even though I just ordered it on Sunday, it got #7,881 out of 63K! I was freaking out!

I haven't even gone through the extras yet, but I'm sure I will be satisfied. Of course it's not PERFECT, but nothing WB puts out will be if they can milk it a little more later. I don't think we'll ever see and extended edition of the other six films, but in terms of getting the dream set I have been waiting for (and not buying the Ultimate Editions because of), THIS IS IT.

Notes:
I would have preferred a Time Turner over a Horcrux locket, but now I have the perfect excuse any time I just feel like being a grump!
People have complained about the set being made of cardboard, but unless you really abuse it, it won't look like cardboard. It's very attractive.
Some people have complained about the price. Yes, it is VERY expensive. But, if you are a die-hard fan that has been waiting for years for this set like I have, it is worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY.

Enjoy the set, Harry Potter fans!",1346976000,6,1243,4.232067510548523
5083466,5,B007FSEAHY,"Got the set today in the mail and it is awesome. The box is really well made and the extras are very high quality. I was most impressed with the book(lets?) that the discs are packaged in. Not only are they very sturdy but they are beautiful; the new artwork fits the HP universe nicely. Obviously this set obviously has a ton of creative input from those who actually worked on the movies.

But is it worth it?

-If you are a collector and a huge HP fan that has not bought the movies (waiting for something like this), then yes absolutely.

-If you already have the ultimate editions for years 1-6, then get the year 7 editions that will be out in October. You only are missing the extra pack ins, the amazing packaging, and maybe the extra bonus features (but I have a feeling they will find there way into the ultimate editions as well).

-If you have no need for bonus features then get the regular 8 disc blu ray that is still for sale for a very reasonable price (and really why complain about this set if there is already a cheaper product that fits your needs?).

-If you are waiting for additional extended additions, then keep waiting... forever. Or watch ABC family so you can see a few deleted scenes cut back in without director approval...

So in the end I rate this set 5 Stars because it really is epic. And for anyone out there that feels it is too much money and WB is screwing you, then this is not for you. WB provides MANY other ways to buy all the movies and I am sure you can find a set that fits your needs. This is not meant to be the budget version. There is only 63K of them and really that is not too many when you consider how many HP fans there are, so WB was never planning on selling too many of them.",1346976000,24,1734,4.176646706586826
5083467,5,B007FSEAHY,Today is September 7 the release date for this collection. I Pre ordered in August and received my set at about 10 am this morning. I am thrilled. I had a lot of thoughts about spending 360 bucks on a blu ray set but this one is worth it! First off ...most all of the bad reviews on this set were written before it was even released and secondly a lot of idiots are writing reviews on the years 1-7 set or 1-8 set. The box is not cheap cardboard like everyone says. It is more than likely card board but wrapped in leather and pieced together with metal hinges and knobs. It is made well. It includes 2 automatic opening drawers. That hold some suprises. Also the map is made of cloth not cheap paper and the artwork is all high quality non rip parchment. The horcrux locket is not cheap plastic like I was afraid of but a very well designed metal version. Also the discs are not housed in cheap sleeves! They are all very well protected in there own booklets. The book of artifacts included in the set is a hardback version and there is nothing cheap or rip off..ish about this set. It is definitely worth the money. You get what you pay for! I would also like to add that for those who are crying about not having every single extended version of all 8 films included.all of the deleted scenes and material are included so piece it together yourself. THIS SET ROCKS!!!!,1346976000,44,1371,4.297297297297297
5083468,1,B007FSEAHY,"Ok, this is a review for the Harry Potter Wizards Collection.  The thing is HUGE.  All the DVDs, blu rays and other discs are packaged very well.  It is like standard movie cases, which you sit the disc on the little tab.  I was happy with that.  That being said, almost off the the discs have scratches ALL over them.  I was so upset when I saw this.  It had to happen as the discs were put into the set, because they don't move once locked in.  I do not blame Amazon for this at all.  Now, I have to get the scratched movies mailed to me.  I will not send the set back because of the rarity of it.  I have not contacted amazon yet, I decided to let the buyers now first.  If you get this, be sure to check out each disc once you get it.  Good luck fellow Potter fans.  All that aside, the set is cool.  You get a book and some cool pictures and you get a certificate.  Each movie comes in a book that is very sturdy.  It has the DVD, blu ray, digital and special features.  It is very cool.  The case is built sturdy.  Everything is really neat.  I just have to get better discs.

Update:
Good old Amazon.  They had me a new copy ready to ship while we were talking.  So, I easily had that taken care of.  I'm sure the new set I get will be as good as new.

More stuff:
Well, in this set there are a couple more things I did not even see.  There are two little parts you can push and they pop out.  One has the digital codes to download all of the Potter films and the other I think has some sort of candy in a little black bag.  I found this when I was looking for the digital codes.  I wanted to make sure I got them.  When I get the new set, I will delete these and download using the new codes I get.

I don't think this is Amazons fault.  I'm not even sure if it is the company that makes it's fault.  What if during the shipping process, the boxes got bumped around?  When you think about it, while it may be annoying to pay almost $400 for something and have it be unable to play, the company is the one loosing the money.  Now that I and we have gotten the sets, no matter how many we get that are damaged, we will get new sets.  So at least we are good there.

More thoughts:
I just wanted to defend ultraviolet.  Now, I like Apple.  I will always choose Apple over any other company.  But ultraviolet isn't that bad.  They have so much you can get from them.  They are set up very well.  You have one code in the Harry Potter Wizards Collection.  It lets you download ALL the movies.  They could have given 8 codes.  But they saved us time and gave us one.  Now as for those who say you can not download the movies on your computer, that simply is not true.  I have gotten two or three movies with ultraviolet digital copy, downloaded them on my UV account, then to my PC.  With Potter and ALL the other movies I've gotten from them, it says I will be able to download them on I believe December 20th.  So, you CAN download the movies onto your computer.  You may just have to wait a short time to do them all.

Mad hatter hat is now on!!!!
See, now I'm mad.  I arrived home today and saw a box sitting on the bottom of our stairs.  I took out the new Harry Potter set and looked at the first blu ray and DVD.  COMPLETELY destroyed.  Scratches and marks ALL over the DVD.  I am going to tell Amazon they need to discontinue the set until the company that is making them can check each disc in the set.  It really upsets me.  How can a company put merchandise out that is so badly damaged?  Do they do it in a country that's workers are rabbits?  It is ridiculous.

Update:
Ok, this review is getting kind of long, but I will keep updating as I get new sets.  Today I got my third set, opened it, checked the discs, damaged.  I have a feeling that I will keep getting damaged sets, but I already paid for it, so I will just keep getting them until one is not damaged.

Fourth set, damaged.  Fifth set, damaged.  Sixth set, damaged.  BUT, now Amazon has taken it off their site.  You can no longer buy it.  Good for them.  I would have to assume that others told them they had problems as well.  Now I'm worried that I will not know when they put the set back on for sale.  I have one here that is number 14,000 something and the one I got today is number 50,000 something.  I can not see Amazon selling out of the set.  It is rather expensive.  Man, I had mine of the day it was released.  I think it was the first time I've paid for one day shipping.  I guess that shows me.

Seventh set, damaged.  That was it.  I told myself that I would keep getting new sets until I got a good one.  But, I am sick of being let down every other day.  I have no confidence that I will EVER get an undamaged set.  So, I told Amazon I want a refund.  I have already added the ultimate edition blu rays to my shopping cart.  Now, when Amazon sees that I sent the set back and I get my $350 some dollars back, I will get the first 6 movies.  Then, when the last two come out on the blu ray ultimate editions, I will get them.  I already feel better.  The set seems so cool, but time after time they let me down.  Not Amazon, Amazon is always great, but the company that makes the discs.  So, now I will get some credit back that I can put towards the movies and Christmas stuff.  I pre ordered a Wii U from Kmart, maybe I will pre order a Wii U game.  If anyone wants this set, I would have to say it's not worth it.  But, buy at your own risk.  Good shopping Amazon shoppers and have a great holiday!!!!

Last night After Amazon had gotten all eight of my sets back, they gave me the credit back.  It was about $350.  I was going to just order the movies on blu ray.  But, while looking on Amazon (which is one of my favorite things to do) I found the Harry Potter Ultimate Editions.  Years 1 - 6 were out and I got them for good prices.  Today I looked and found that years 7-8 were coming out in one set.  Today I got years 1 and 3 in the mail.  Both have the original and extended cut versions of the film, as well as digital copies and bonus features.  Year 3 has like 3 hours of extras!!!!  Also, the boxes are really big.  I think all 8 movies could be stacked up and be the size of two of the extended cut boxes.  If you are having problems with the set as I did, do your self a favor and get the extended editions.  They have all the great extras and both versions of the film (when available) and best of all, they arrived damage free.  Actually, when I looked at year 3 I saw scratches.  It was like a horror movie.  But, I wiped gently and it was just dust.  So everything is great!!!!  I just pre ordered the final two movies in the extended edition.  I am 100% happy now.  The only thing you will not get is the cool box, I am sure some of the extras and all the problems that I and many others have and are having with the set.  Ok, that is all.  This will probably be the final thing I write about this set.  Now I'm of to eat then later read The Casual Vacancy on my iPad.  LOL",1346976000,19,6988,3.963150289017341

The memorabilia is awesome too, they have a limited edition blueprint of Hogwarts, a tapestry style print of the Hogwarts layout, a book of ""artifacts"" from production, a book of labels, a scroll style listing for all the DVDS with a code for the UltraViolet versions. The DVD covers themselves are amazing, each one has it's own individual color scheme that matches the feeling of the movie and each disc matches the box it comes in. My edition was the limited numbered edition because I pre-ordered, not sure if those are available still, but my edition also came with a Horcrux recreation, which was awesome, it's the Slytherin locket, and all the compartments are secret because I had to have my husband help me find some of the stuff which is awesome the way they put it together. Only thing is it's HEAVY like 20 pounds and won't fit on a shelf, but I think it's totally worth it.

What you are paying for here is just the super big & really nice display box that it comes in. It's not wood (like another reviewer suggested). It's some kind of very sturdy cardboardy type stuff, but it is just beautiful looking. All the little drawers & compartments that pop out are so cute.

Not some huge trunk like its advertised by idiots and Warner bros alike. 2nd it was marked down from the price here on amazon and it still wasn't even worth the marked down price.

All the detail in each of the movie cases is incredible, as well the detail in all of the items that come in the box, such as the map (which can be hung on the built-in hardware), blueprint, pendant, and artifact/label catalogues.

5083478,1,B007FSEAHY,"Dear WB, I love HP. I went to the park. I have seen all the movies. I haven't bought them because I was waiting for a collection somewhat like this one. Here's why I won't buy it.

1. Price. No matter how much I love HP, I will not spend 350 dollars on the movies.

2. 31 discs. Who are you trying to fool? I don't need each movie twice. I just need them on blu ray. If people still buy DVD then you should sell a separate set for it.

3. Ultra violet. I have no interest in Ultra Violet. Give me a real digital copy.

4. No extended cuts of the last movies. What are you waiting for? You won't get my money until I feel I'm getting my money's worth.

So until then, I will just re-read my books. I'm in no hurry to own them or give you my money. When you do right by the fans, the fans will happily buy your product. Everyone knows this is just greedy cash grab. BTW, the collector's edition in France is so much prettier. I'd rather have that one.",1346803200,12,949,3.9476439790575917
5083479,1,B007FSEAHY,"Update:  Okay, things are a little better now as far as Ultraviolet is concerned.  Now, with the updated Flixter app (available in the Amazon app store) you can download movies directly onto your Kindle Fire HD (or you can use VUDU on your pc), and you can watch them even without Wi-Fi.

Since my first review, the final two movies have come out in 1 ultimate edition boxed set, but I still say if you have a Blu-ray player, you do not need DVDs!

Original review posted on Sept. 5, 2012:
I have been waiting for a boxed set like this to come out for years.  What a disappointment to learn that only the first 2 movies have the extended versions.  Not only that, it's way overpriced!

Also, you don't get a true digital copy.  Ultraviolet is not a true digital copy, and requires you to log on to the internet in order to watch your movie.  This its truly inconvenient for many people, including myself, because I live in the Sierra Nevada, which while it's BEAUTIFUL here, the power goes out at least 3 times a season on average, and therefore, my Wi-Fi becomes useless.  It's been really nice for the last 3 years or so to be able to still watch movies on my phone without using too much power, but I guess now Harry Potter will not be able to help me pass the time.  Luckily, I still have the books.

I also don't understand why DVDs have to be included with Blu-ray discs.  If you have a Blu-ray player, why do you need DVDs?  You don't.  If both were not included the price wouldn't be nearly as high.  Although I'm sure Warner Bros. would still charge the same price!

If Warner Bros. comes out with an Ultimate set, I will snatch that up in a heartbeat.  I'm not sure why the last Ultimate editions haven't been released for the last 2 films, but hopefully they are on their way!",1346803200,9,1787,4.315315315315315

That would have meant something and really made me buy this.  I already have all that they are offering in this set, for the most part.  So there's nothing making me want to get this.  And, for the price and what you get, it's just way too much.  I'd rather wait a few more years for the directors cut versions to be released (if hopefully ever), and just get those.  You figure 8 movies at about $20 each is $160 for all the films, vs. what WB is charging for this.  $160 is far more appealing.

5083490,5,B007FSEAHY,"HP fans, read this very, very...VERY carefully...

There. Won't. Be. Extended. Editions. Of. All. Eight. Films.

Period.

This isn't like The Lord of the Rings or Titanic where they filmed an enormous amount of film that wasn't used. LOTR created their extended editions, and Titanic created Titanic Explorer, which utilized many historical scenes filmed by James Cameron that he couldn't fit into the film.

The first two films were narrowed down to 2-hour movies, because they thought that these films were only going to be enjoyed by children (note the playful, almost whimsical qualities in many of the scenes, the ""and-they-all-learned-a-valuable-lesson"" kind of mentality). It wasn't until after those movies were successes that they realized that everyone from young child to adult would get enjoyment out of these films. Therefore, Chris Columbus authorized extended ""director's"" cuts of the first 2 films, because they had cut scenes that could advance the plot.

The directors for subsequent films stated that they created exactly what they wanted - no more, no less. They are very unlikely to create extended editions for them. There are several reasons why a scene could be cut - pacing, not adding to the plot, etc. Adding them in interrupts the flow of the film and can detract from the plot. It wasn't that way with the first two films, so they added in scenes that added to the film itself.

This is the comprehensive set of all eight films as they *SHOULD* appear. I'm truly sorry, folks. But that's all that there ever will be. So get this set and stop lamenting that which you can't have. Otherwise...Voldemort has won.",1345507200,12,1638,5.0036764705882355

I have all the books, I attended the midnight showing of 3-8 and even have my own robes and wand I wore to the final movie. Not owning the movies was tough to handle at first but I rented the dvds and watched the movies on cable and waited. It was worth it. This set is amazing, a true collectors items aimed at people like me who are the ultimate fans. $349 is a little steep for me but being able to buy things that means so much is the reason I get up and go to work each day. Whats the point of living and working if you can't blow a little money now and then. It will end up a combined Christmas and Birthday present but that's ok, my official universal robes were too.. I am the 47yr old nerd who dressed up when she went to the Deathly Hallows first showing and when I went to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. When I walked under the archway into Hogsmeade at Universal studios I just wanted to cry.. It was so real and so there and so amazing and so magical, so yeah I pre-ordered this set. I posted my pic on the website gallery of people who also pre-ordered and I anxiously await the arrival.

Those who can't justify the expense or just don't want to spend that much money do have the choice of not buying.

The directors of these movies make this choice, and if they say no, there is nothing that Warner Brothers can do to add them to this package. For the people who are complaining about the Ultraviolet copy included instead of a digital copy, you are still able to view the movies offline. Within the app, there is a button to download the movies to your device, so it is just like having a digital copy.

IF you factor these extras in however, you have INCREDIBLE value on this set.  The horcrux pendant can be bought at noblecollection.com (where I buy all of my HP replicas) for $50 alone.  This, in addition to buying the ultimate editions of all the movies available right now is more expensive than the $350 paid for this.  Now keep in mind that they have all sorts of other collector's items in one package, and the price to buy them all individually (although some pieces cannot be bought separately) really means this package is a screaming deal.  You are getting a true and VERY limited item, for true HP fans like myself!  Keep in mind they are only making 63,000 of these, for the entire world, might sound like a lot but it really isn't.

I have many collectible items but this is insane. I am very upset about WB setting this at such a huge price. There is no way i would ever be able to pay for this. Yes it does come with a few great features but having blu ray discs when some fans don't have a blu ray player to begin with is ridiculous. On top of that having one of the best features be an ultra violet disc is not fair. I am disgusted that WB would try to pull one over on us harry potter fans. I for one think its an insult. I've been waiting for this box set since i saw the first movie and read the books but had no idea that this is what i would get. I personally don't understand. My generation that grew up with these characters are at the age now where we are starting our own families and getting out on our own so how are we expected to dish out $350 for something we have waited so long for. i can't even describe how disappointed i am.,1343779200,14,1054,3.9069767441860463

A less greedy consumer waits before buying them.  Anyone who is a fan of series movies knows not to buy the movies until all are released. There is always going to be something bigger and better and this looks amazing!  I LOVE Harry Potter and I can't wait until my kids are old enough for me to share the books and this set with them.

The dvds are not region free but will play in any computer dvd drive with free dvd playback software. I picked up 2 of them for 300.71 pounds which is only $471 bucks. Thats only $121 more than getting just one on the US amazon site. The list price on Amazon UK is 177.99 pounds but when you add it to your cart it and check out it drops down to 148.33 pounds.

It makes me cringe to think about how greedy WB is being with this franchise, one that seems to have no end with Harry Potter spanning generations. As a fan base we shouldn't stand for it. We don't need another wave of discs that we have already bought time and time again. WB has already made billions from Harry Potter and they will continue to make money off of it if they would give us what we want: more bonus material! That's all we want. I am speaking for myself now, but I don't really want any more trinkets, any more swag, I. Want. Stuff. I. Haven't. Seen. Nothing less.

5083518,5,B007FSEAHY,"Hi guys..
I'm not here to really review but to tell you to check out the UK amazon.
Jason has already posted a through review and you can get information there.
So he said it'd be worthy if it's $250.
inspired by the fact that ""UK gets everything that's best about HP,"" I went on the UK amazon.
the listed price is 177.99 pounds, which, if you use a currency converter, is considerably cheaper than the US/Canada one.
Note: if you are worried about the play regions, it's marked as region free. and obviously the box contains the same thing as is in US/Canada. And, the release date for UK is slightly different from North America, it is Sept. 10 instead of Sept. 7.
I have to address another thing: the digital copy. the US one is clearly UV digital, but some one said the Canadian one is actual disc. I checked Amazon.ca but this issue is not specified. Now the UK one, is UV digital, same as in the US.
About shipment: I honestly don't know how it works, but when i tried to proceed to check out and have it shipped to Canada(my home), the shipment (standard 6-10 business days) it self costs roughly 3 pounds, but it comes to a TOTAL OF 151 POUNDS.
I am confused as you are right now about why the price would drop from 177.99 to 148 pounds for the set.
But that's a good thing isn't it? =)
I realized this review is kinda tedious... but for HP fans like me(who doesn't have a lot of money) this is noteworthy information.
=)

Just google amazon uk for the uk amazon. the add is amazon.co.uk  just so you know.",1343692800,4,1514,4.2717770034843205
5083519,1,B007FSEAHY,"I've been waiting since the watered down hp blu ray collection came out last year to buy all the harry potter movies on Blu Ray because I heard there was going to be a new version in a year with all sorts of special features.  I have all the movies on DVD so I don't need those for starters like I assume every other person in the target market for this product.  I got more cool trinkets in a book my sister bought at her college book store for me that I assure you cost less than a 10th of this product so essentially you're asking Harry potter fans to pay $350 for 8 movies on Blu Ray and 5 hours of bonus content.  ABSURD!  Here's a comparison of what you can get for that price (though admittedly I haven't checked the prices on these products in awhile) The Entire Super Blu Ray Box Set of Lost (All 6 Seasons!), The Star Wars Blu Ray Collection (All Six movies!), and the Entire Set of FireFly and its Movie on Blu Ray!

So I'm just going to hold out and wait until Warner releases 7.1 and 7.2 as separate Ultimate Editions.

We have all seen the movies, and many of us if not ALL Harry Potter fans have every single DVD or Blu-Ray that has been released. Please, don't try to tell me there is 5 hours of never before seen blah blah blah, we've seen it you just want to rip us off by having us HP fans think we're getting something brand new.

I'm personally upset that WB wouldn't have the foresight to just release it like this instead of making me pay on the side of $40 a Blu-Ray, which didn't include the UltraViolet copy, or the DVD. So now, already half-way through buying the series, I find that they've decided to release a box set. Really freaking cool, WB.

Maybe, instead of trying to milk Harry Potter fans for all that they're worth, you can save them money by doing one big release instead of a bunch of individuals.

All of these negative responses to something that hasn't even been released yet is pretty silly. If you're upset, don't buy it, it's that simple. But there most definitely ARE people that will want to purchase this. Anyone with the films already doesn't need to buy this, but i'm going to, since I grew up watching these movies at a young age without a job or parents who could afford the films, and now i'm old enough to get it for myself, so I'll be choosing this.",1343692800,5,691,4.282442748091603

Yet, we have this collection, with only 8 MOVIES and exclusive items, and this is double the price?  Where is the logic in that?

Even if this was the penultimate box set, that $350.00 price tag is astronomical.  I only have this pre-ordered because I'm hoping they come to their senses and lower this ridiculous price.  If they don't, they can kiss my pre-order goodbye because I'm not spending double the funds on less than half the entertainment of the Bond set.

Now, moving on to the rest of the product:

No new extended editions.

Most features are not new, they've just been scattered and are now brought together. The price is way too out of this world for the features it includes.

31 discs, half of which are a waste of space and resources.

The box is an eye-opener but it's contents will make a true fan cringe. The pre-orders are apparently up, but I'm more than certain that the people who've made the orders are just doing it because they see a pretty box and huge number of discs and jump at the scam...I mean offer. True fans have reviewed this as only true fans can.

We deserve a box set that includes an extended edition of all the movies, special features that we haven't seen before, collectibles we can't get anywhere else, etc. We've waited a long time, but if this is what you're offering, we can wait a little longer.

True fans please do not waste your money. The more people that buy it the less chance we'll have to get a better product, one worth our praise.

To be fair, the movies themselves all warrant 5-stars.  This package and extra labels and all look very nice and would make a great addition to any collection.  But not for the outrageous price they are offering!!  Come on, give the fans a break!  I would be willing to pay roughly half what they are expecting to charge.

But it would have to be for the EXTENDED versions... for all of them!  Fans do not want piece-meal versions or just years 1/2 two extended.  Give us the additional scenes, give us the deleted material included.  Give us Hogwarts the way it was meant to be!!

I wouldn't even mind if they did it the way Lord of the Rings did... a normal boxed-set and an extended version boxed-set.  At least there we got what we wanted, just had to wait longer for it.

As much as I was looking forward to this, I cannot justify buying this at the current price.  Especially for a product that, in my opinion, is still incomplete.

This is not the final, definitive collection because that would mean this contains every single possible feature that will ever be released and thats not even close to true. Where are the extended editions for all films (this does not include versions with the deleted scenes put in)?
Where are the Ultimate Editions that are purposly being delayed to try and sell this instead. The Ultimate Editions were supposed to be the final collection.

All of these documentaries and extra footage (which I hoped they would release the extended versions of Year 5 to Year 7 part 2) that have never been seen before. I would love to have this one day when the price is really low even though its limited but with a price of almost 400 dollars i doubt they will sell quickly. I love Harry Potter sooooo much but Warner Bros. should release a set that is affordable to the fans!!!!!!,1341187200,4,575,4.142857142857143
5083544,1,B007FSEAHY,"Wow, what a fantastic box set this is. All the movies which I already have, on dvd AND on blu-ray! How about giving us the choice, dvd OR blu-ray? But then again, no one would buy it because every Harry Potter fan already HAS the dvds/blu-rays! @WB, do you honestly think people are going to buy this?

Things that should be here but are not included in this 'magical' box set:
1. The new features on DVD: has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that not all people have Blu-Ray Players? And for heaven's sake, those new features can't be good enough to release in HD! They will have normal 2.0 audio for a start...
2. All the extended movies! I'm not even asking for new scenes, just all the movies with the deleted scnes would be a marvellous box set already.
3. A re-make of the first three dvds with audio description ffor the blind.
4. 3D versions of all the movies.

There are so many things Warner Bros can still release but refuse to give us, like:

a. Complete versions of the soundtracks: all the recording sessions for the eight movies, Iwould do anything in the world to have these!!! PLEASE, WB, READ THIS!
b. Extended editions of all the movies.
c. The bloopers.
And so on.

Conclusion: Warner Bros, you are the most idiotic company on the globe. People on websites like the Final Fantasy Shrine forums are literally craving for all the Harry Potter music ever recorded, but you refuse pointblank to consider releasing them (beats me why), not to mention that you fool your customers with 'exclusive 5.1 surround downloads of the music' while you just put stereo files on your website which I would have to decode with some programme that doesn't change the sound whatsoever. If I write to you about this, you answer in an irritated way or completely ignore me.

5083545,1,B007FSEAHY,"To all of the people complaining about price, I'm right there with you. I will say, however that this set is a combination of the Bluray and DVD versions of the Ultimate Editions: Bluray sets are around $35, DVD sets are around $30. 35x8 films + 30x8 films = $520. This includes the expensive 3D copies of DH 1 and 2, though the DVD extended editions of 1 and 2 didn't make it to the set. Ultimately, with that in mind, the set IS fairly priced. But it was a VERY bad choice to only release a COMPLETE BLURAY and DVD set. They should have had 1 Bluray Set, 1 DVD Set, and 1 Combo set... they've ticked off a LOT of the fan base by doing it this way...

BUT my main complaint is this: WHERE ARE THE ULTIMATE EDITIONS OF DEATHLY HALLOWS 1 and 2???!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything that will be included in them is in THIS set, but is NOT being released simultaneously. So many big fans have collected these ultimate editions, which have gotten cheaper-made and less ""Ultimate"" with each pair of releases. Removal of magnets and extended editions after the first two, removal of the 3rd disc and differently sized cases after the first 4... You're lucky we as fans still want to buy these at all, but we do so that we can complete our collections. RELEASE THEM PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Until then, I will advise everyone I know to stay away from this big set, because you are slighting the fans that have been investing in your set.",1341014400,8,1418,4.432950191570881

So I guess I'll buy the normal blue rays and be done with it.  A pretty box is not enough.  The only series I'm buying for the box is The Walking Dead Season 2 and believe me the Box is worth it, way better than this and only costed me $70.  This doesn't even come close to the Lord of the Ring Extended Edition Boxed set, which where 50 each, but with TONS of stuff to watch, more hours to enjoy.

I've payed $250 for the Blu-ray Ultimate Editions over the past 3 years, and now Warner Brothers decides to not come out with Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2 with the Ultimate Editions, but this stupid ""Wizard's Collection"" which is simply a box set of the Ultimate Editions. $500 for the whole set is ridiculous, so thank God it's only $350 with pre-order. But the only way I would even pay that is if Warner Brothers will take back the 6 Ultimate Editions I already own and knock off $250 from the $350 price (which would amount to the retail value of all 6 Ultimate Editions). I would gladly trade in my 1-6 Ultimate Editions to get this for $100. I think we loyal fans deserve at least that, and not the company taking a massive dump on us.

UPDATE:

Warner Bros. did in fact release Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2 in a single Ultimate Edition box set shortly after the Wizard's Collection came out, so I'm glad they heard our cries about that.

Also, I ended up receiving the Wizard's Collection as a gift from someone, and am ultimately happy with it. I was able to trade in my Ultimate Editions for some (though less than $90) Amazon credit, and the Wizard's Collection includes some very nice features, exclusive bonus content, and collectibles.

I only wish that I had not purchased the Ultimate Editions to begin with, and am still a little sore about the $250+ that was spent on them. Warner Bros. should not have sold individual collector's editions if they knew they were going to make a giant collector's box set in the end. Really, it was their way of milking more money than necessary by taking advantage of die hard fans of the series, which is why I still won't give it 5-stars.

The real issue here is the price WB is asking for the WC.

Considering this set is really just a re-packaging of the Ultimate Editions, I think it's fair to compare them.  I routinely see the Ultimate Edition Blu-ray's selling for $25 each.  Assuming that films 7 and 8 will be released and also be found at $25, that would bring a complete Ultimate Edition collection up to $200.  Does Warner Bros. really believe that the Wizards Collection Box Set packaging and minimal additional extras are worth an additional $150?  Even with needlessly extended films included, $350 is WAY to expensive since you'd have 90% of what this set offers with the Ultimate Editions. And remember $350 is the discounted Amazon price.  WB is really charging $500 for what fans can get right now for only $200.  Reprehensible!

WB needs to lower the WC price to $250 tops and release the stand alone Ultimate Editions of films 7 and 8 right along side it. Stop trying to gouge the fans WB!",1337040000,2,1281,4.554585152838428

If you buy this your just encouraging Warner to ignore customer damand and steal our money.",1336521600,,369,4.522388059701493
5083585,1,B007FSEAHY,"This is overpriced for what you get, considering most of us already have it.

I bought the first five films on DVD, but then stopped because I wanted to wait to get the Blu-Ray Box Set of the entire series. I can't believe that Warner Bros is not including the extended versions of the last six films and the cost is astronomical. I bet Warner Bros is going to release ANOTHER Box Set of the HP movies at a later date with the extended movie versions. I've noticed that in other movies that have sequels. The movie studios tend to re-release the films over and over again (with a little ""extra"" special features or extended versions to justify the re-releases). I just wish that the movie studios would stop being so greedy and release the Film Box Sets ONCE (with ALL special features, digital copies and extended versions). It's not fair to the fans who are anxiously awaiting for the DVD release. It's not right and it's very upsetting.",1336435200,8,923,4.532934131736527

5083589,1,B007FSEAHY,"Warner Brothers have been doing nothing but re-releasing the same content in different packages over and over again. They didn't even finish releasing all the Ultimate Editions. How upsetting is that for fans who bought the previous 6 but can now no longer finish that collection? The two discs that should have been in the last two UEs are available in this wizard collection. I'm sure these two discs are counted towards the ""5 hours of new features"" they promise. It's sickening to hold out material to put in a $350 collection just so it has a selling point. The rumor that I had heard for HP not releasing the ""extended"" cuts of their films was that the directors didn't want to. Well, as easily shown by most of the reviews on here and all the UEs past one and two, fans want the extended cuts! Why should the directors of a film with such a large fan base ignore us? Until they say it's okay to release the extended editions, all the fans are going to get are re-packaged versions of the same two dvds + one blu-ray along with a small amount of new features on a DVD over and over again, so that by the time we get to see all the features, we'll have 8 copies of the same movie.

5083591,1,B007FSEAHY,This is $350 and won't even be the last release. WHY IS THERE NO EXTENDED VERSIONS OF THE MOVIES WITH THE EXTRA SCENES APART FROM THE 1ST TWO? HOW LAZY ARE YOU WB?! A RELEASE OF THIS LOW QUALITY IS JUST INSULTING,1336348800,2,212,4.071428571428571
5083592,1,B007FSEAHY,"If anyone at WB thought that this was going to be a hit with the fans then they are deranged! Offering people lots of old content that most people already have with some new extras is NOT WORTH that much money.

6/8 'Creating The World' documentaries have already been on sale;
8/8 Theatrical versions have already been on sale;
4/4 'Disk 2' disks have already been on sale;
2/2 3D versions have already been on sale;

And it's dissapointing that extended editions of the later movies won't be released. Is that how a company rewards it's customers? By starting a massive DVD collection for the entire series and then not finish it? I'm sorry but I won't be spending any more of my money on HP DVDs.,1336348800,4,507,4.347368421052631

WB already released the first six movies as 'Ultimate Editions' and from the looks of it, the last two Ultimate Editions are going to be in THIS set instead of finishing off the previous set. I've already wasted money on these Ultimate Editions and I want a full set. Further more, I do not see anything particularly new to stuff already on the Ultimate Editions. And no uncut/director's cut of the last six films? C'mon WB! What's the point of having an uncut version of the first two but not the last SIX!? Had I not already wasted my money on buying the Ultimate Editions that are already out, I'd be more than okay with this (except for the price, holy s***). The only things I would be interested in is the other memorabilia that come with it, but I'm not fishing out about $400 just for that, and again, for most of the stuff I already have. While I do want a blu-ray set in the future, this product just isn't worth it. I could say more but I think the other comments have covered far more than I have.",1336348800,4,1044,4.304568527918781

You open it and there's another smaller box inside. I measured. Once everything is unpacked and you are looking at the actual wizard box, it is almost 12"" high, 9"" wide, and 10 in diameter. The box is really hard... I would say it is wood, but I'm not sure because I've never seen this type of material before. It is very heavy. almost 30 pounds in shipping weight. But very very pleased with this product. Great for any harry potter fan.

I've waited my whole fan life for two things:

1.  The Stephen Fry audiobooks in the US
2.  The Ultimate - all inclusive - Harry Potter box set with all set documentaries, extended versions and extra footage.

The Lord of the Rings did it.  I'm pretty sure they still made buckets of money.

I thought this was going to be awesome.  I was wrong.",1336262400,5,569,4.436893203883495
5083601,1,B007FSEAHY,"apart from everything every other single person is saying on here, which (for the most part) i agree with, i would like to add my thoughts.

1. ultraviolet digital copy is a bunch of crap. no matter how you try to defend it, it is a steamy pile of crap.
2. if they're going to market this as a nice organized box, make it out of wood, a hard plastic, or something that is actually durable... not cardboard. if you can stack something else on top of it without any problems, then it's good.
3. there are only a few things (i believe i counted like 5?) included in this collection that hasn't been seen before.  i mean really? we're supposed to spend $500 bucks to get 5 new things?
4. I bought all of the films at Walmart in December for $30... this included DVD/BluRay copies of each movie with a bonus features disc, as well as the ultraviolet digital copy of both DH films.  this was a total steal, yes, and probably won't ever be repeated, but how on earth is THIS worth over ten times that amount?! (when considering WB's price... NOT Amazons). oh and these films all came in hard plastic cases, not cardboard or a paper sleeve.
5. even if you hadn't purchased a single copy of any HP film in the past and you now want the full deal, I would never buy this.  Get creative people, look at garage sales, ebay, craigslist, and your local thrift/buyback store.  I've seen the ultimate editions priced at $20 each on amazon just this week, and even cheaper at my local video and music thrift store.  no matter how you spin it, this is not worth this much money, especially considering you can purchase the 6 ultimate editions for about $120 (assuming the $20 per pricing) and the only additional stuff counts up to 5! one of which is an EXTENDED version of the convo between Dan and Jo... making me expect about 10-20 extra minutes.

worth the extra money?? i think not, even if you've never owned a single HP ANYTHING. it simply is not worth it.",1336262400,3,1945,4.371191135734072

I have not bought any of the Harry Potter movies because I was waiting for a really cool box set that contained everything. This box set, at first glance, looks really neat, and it is actually kind of cool, but it is way too expensive and I was really expecting better from them. I think it is pointless to have both the DVD versions and Blue Ray versions together in the same set. I just want one ultimate version of each movie that has everything I need with all of the extras, not three different discs of the same movie again and again. This is one of the reasons why this box set is so expensive and I don't want to be paying more for things I don't need or already have. The ultimate box sets released in other countries were a lot better than this.

Label Collection
This 32 page, 5"" x 7"" perfect-bound collection of prop labels from the films was designed exclusively for this collection by MinaLima Design. The book includes labels from potions, memory vials, Honeydukes and Wheasley's Wheezes.

Harry Potter Catalogue of Artefacts
This 48 page rigid book was created by MinaLima Design: Eduardo Lima, Miraphora Mina and Lauren Wakefield, former graphic designers on the Harry Potter films. Filled with their favorite props from the films designed in ""shadow boxes,"" this stunning catalogue can only be found in the Harry Potter Wizard's Collection.

Also Includes: UltraViolet Copies of all 8 films, Marauder's Map, and other memorabilia from the films!

Pros:
Films - All 8 films are included in this set in Blu-Ray, DVD, and UltraViolet forms. The 1st two films have the extended editions included and the final 2 have a 3D version included. Overall, if you're a fan of the series, this is a great set to see exclusive versions of all the films.
Features - There is 13 discs that contain only bonus features. I believe that it is great to have every single bonus feature created for the Harry Potter series to be located in one set. There is also new features being released on a few of the discs that have never been seen before. This includes a documentary about stunts and the final two parts of the ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary. One of the features I'm anticipating the most, is the Maximum Movie mode of the films. Sure, most of these features were already released, but what did you expect? People should have been expecting a rerelease from the moment they heard an entire Harry Potter series was being created.
Packaging - The packaging in the set looks amazing. I haven't been able to see the packaging in front of me, so I don't know how sturdy it is, but I love how it's set up. It's like we have our case packed with everything needed for our trip into the Potter universe.

Cons:
Extended Editions - I'll start with the most obvious con. The first two films are the only ones that include extended versions of the films. As sad as it sounds, it would be pretty difficult to ever get the ABC Family cuts of all films on DVD. For the 1st 2 films, Chris Columbus made his own cut of the movies to be shown on DVD, so they were authorized extended/director's cuts. For the rest of the films, ABC simply placed all of the deleted scenes back in the film to make the movie to the right length to fill up the time slot. These aren't authorized and were exclusively made for the TV. David Yates has stated that it would even be hard to create an Extended Edition of the last few films because he used as much footage as he could possibly used with ""every reel of film"" being used when producing it.
Price - I know I stated that the price makes sense above, but I still think its a little pricy. I believe $200 may be a great release price, and this price isn't set in stone, so it's likely to change before the release date.

Overall, I can't wait for this set and I'm likely to order it so it's delivered on my doorstep the day it was released. I will update this as more features are released.",1335052800,16,17524,4.936271186440678
5083616,1,B007FSEAHY,I haven't bought a single bluray waiting for this big set and this is it?!? so you pay 280 dollars on packaging. nice one duba-duba--duba-duba--WB. O_O,1334966400,3,151,4.846153846153846

5083618,5,B007FSEAHY,"People no matter how much you moan and groan it's not going to change. Here's a fun thing: if you don't like it and don't want it then MOVE THE FREAK ON. DON'T BASH THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE. And be honest with yourselves, if this set included everything that you are complaining about it would be well over $1000. So be happy with what your getting. If you don't like it and feel that the other set is a better buy for you then by all means go get that one but don't complain for things that just aren't going to happen.

I personally can't wait to get this set, not only does it look cool but it also has tons of stuff in it. Pre-ordered mine and I can't wait.",1334707200,6,686,4.007299270072993
5083619,1,B007FSEAHY,"You have got to be kidding me. I don't need 31 discs. Why not just make a collection with the special packaging with Blu-ray movies, extended editions and special extras only. I don't need the DVD versions of each. I can't believe there's not an extended version of all the movies... And the price WTF? I'm a big fan but this is such a disappointment.",1334534400,5,351,4.415384615384616
5083620,1,B007FSEAHY,"My title says it all.  This ""ultimate"" boxed set does NOT include extended editions of all 8 films.  I already got burned buying the collection of all 8 blu-rays only to discover they weren't the extended editions.  I was hoping that this set would be the one...but it isn't.  For that price I might as well purchase each extended edition individually.  What a rip-off.",1334534400,5,369,4.703125
5083621,5,B007FSEAHY,"Well, I can see most of the reviews on here are very negative. I can't really blame anybody for it if you already own all of the previous editions that have been released. Who would want to pay $350 just for material they already have and then only a little bit of extra content that won't be on any other release? Well, fortunately I won't be having that problem, because the simple fact is that, I don't own any of the films yet. I never actually got around to buy them for myself. I saw all the films in the theaters except for the first one. Everytime another one was released on dvd, I would already know someone who had bought it and I would just go watch it with them. And I've only had brief glimpses of some of the special featurs on some of them, too. So, I am definately pleased to see this ultimate box set being released. It's the one I've been waiting for for a long time. I think it's the only box set worth getting if you don't own any of the films already. So, I can't complain about rebuying something I don't have. I will definately be buying this set when it's released, which will be a treat for me becaue it will be my first time watching them all in chronological order and watching the special features for all the films. As for extended versions of the films, it would've been nice to have those for all eight movies. But, as of right now, your best bet would be to either record the versions that air on ABC Family, or search around online for fan edits of the films that have had everything put back into them.",1334534400,11,1537,4.213559322033898
5083622,1,B007FSEAHY,"OK, we could talk about the price, or the Ultraviolet digital copy, and the lack of extended editions. But, I think I will rant about them all. I have waited for this set for so long only to find it sorely lacking in almost every way imaginable. I will break them down by importance to me.

1. No extended edition of all but the first 2 movies.
WHAT! Are you F'n kidding me? There have been so many sets thrown together by Warner Brothers that I have lost count. After every single movie there has been a ""collectors edition set"" that ""every Harry Potter Fan must own"". Every time I forgo them because I am waiting for the complete set that, (in theory) will have everything I want in one box set. I guess that we have debunked that theory. I will say that I WOULD pay this obscene amount of money IF the extended editions of all of the movies were in it.

2. The price
$499.99? Are you serious? I mean even with the ""price cut"" that Amazon has put on this, shelling out $350 is no small task. And basically, here is what you're paying for. The movies are $90.37 (I know, I just added all of them up at Amazons prices) that makes the ""nice and pretty"" package $259.62 ($349.99 - 90.37 = 259.62). I should also mention that they putting the same Blu-Rays and DVDs you get in the regular editions in the ""nice and pretty"" package, so there isn't even any new artwork. This isn't much of a deal.

3. Lack of I-tunes digital copy.
OK, this isn't a deal breaker for me. I would still buy the set if it had what I wanted in it. I think that digital copy is a good idea, and I own several. But this UltraViolet digital copy is crap. Contrary to what other people have said, yes, you can download the movie to a computer or handheld device...3 times maximum. So, if your like me and have several devices (more than 3) then, you are out of luck. Now you can stream the movie! YAY! IF you have an internet connection and IF you have a ton of bandwidth available. Most of the time I don't have either. You can't do anything on a simple 2 hour flight, or in a run down hotel that doesn't even have Wi/Fi. Sorry for you.

4. The case or box set
I will give you this, it is pretty nice. I like the look of it, and it fits very well with the movie. I can tell a lot of thought went into it. And it looks great. I will not say how durable it is for the obvious reason I haven't held it yet (and may never considering). I am sure that it is made out of cardboard so, you make your own guesses here.

In summary, I understand the longer than average wait. I know that there is an attempt to get it right. But, if Warner Brothers thinks that anyone will buy this set, they are going to be really surprised. The casual fans will not buy it because it is way too expensive. And the hardcore fans will not buy it because it doesn't have anything new in it except for the package. Now who exactly does that leave? Nobody.

A note to Warner Brothers, the most basic rule of business is a very simple one. Supply and Demand. You have the demand (in spades), but if your not willing to supply what the fans want, then you will miss out on an unprecedented opportunity to make a ton of money. But, that is up to you.",1334448000,7,3189,4.118971061093248
5083623,4,B007FSEAHY,"I hope this inflated set is not to replace the Ultimate Edition (UE) for movies seven and eight.  What kind of reputable company, makes a series of movies and not complete the set. What if I wanted to go somewhere and only take the info for movie seven or eight, I'd have to take the whole boxed collection; not to mention that when I set them on my shelf (If I had decided to buy it, which I don't at that price) there's editions one through six then there's no seven and eight. WB is being illogical.

Even if I did buy the high priced set and put it at the end of the shelf, people would look at it and see proof of WB's low moral ethics. Are they doing this intentionally so they can make us buy what we've already bought? I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the outrageous price of basically $350.00. This is greedy. Even to calculate each DVD at $11.30 a piece is expensive as the movies may be worth that much but not the extras. With a price like $350.00 I'd expect the box to be made of attractive wood, ceramic, metal, etc - not cardboard. A little too much sun or water and that's it for the fancy cardboard box.

From what I've found out so far from the UK site about the extra Exclusive memorabilia it includes a Map of Hogwarts, concept art prints, catalogs of props and posters, all designed by the graphic designers from the films. For the price they're asking I'd expect to see something like a mini replica of Dobby standing on top of a hospital bed with HP in it, a drawer containing all seven horcruxes and a real Hogwarts patch.

I would like to have my UE for movies seven and eight so I can have a complete set. I've already bought UEs one through six. It's very insensitive and unfair not to care that some of us have already paid lots of money to have this material already, only to insist that we rebuy it again.

UPDATE ON MY REVIEW  12-08-12

Ok so I took out my credit card and bought- I'll have to really budget my money for a while. I still feel that it is too expensive. The first thing I noticed is how heavy the box was. I opened the box and saw a beautiful burgundy sturdy cardboard square box with gold writing and design on it. What you see in the advertisement is just what you get. The sturdiness is hard like the backing on the bookshelves that they make today.
 I won't go over what you get inside in terms of what cd's you get, because it's been listed in the product information.

You lift up the top and see the first hp CD encased in what looks like a book.  the top inside of the box has a nice design. You can now pull both  right and left sides out as the front flap goes out to reveal the drawers containing the remaining CD'S also in the form of a book.

Behind the first CD of HPSS is a flap the lifts up to  reveal a thin hardback book called HP-catalogue of Artefacts (spelled with an ""e""). It shows different pictures of things used on the HP set. There is also a map showing the layout of the Hogwarts grounds showing where some things took place. This is on quality paper. My favorite is the canvas map of the Hogwarts grounds and smaller side pictures of various places in the series.

 There is a small rectangular drawer containing a rolled up scroll tied in black ribbon that has the access code to the ultra violet movies. You access  the drawer by pushing the drawer in and it pops out.

 The larger pop out drawer contains an authentic Horcrux necklace in a nice black box with the name HP on it from noble collection with an authentic certificate. The locket does not open. The chain is not cheap but I wouldn't say sturdy either but I'm not disappointed. A sponge is placed inside of the pop up box, behind the horcrux box.

A thin wide drawer reveals 29 pg booklet of labels used in the HP series. Some examples used would be labels used in potions, Honeydukes , Hogwarts Trolley, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and vail labels from Dumbledore's memory cabinet.  They don't come out it's a booklet of labels; which is fine with me because if you could take them out I wouldn't any way. Also in the drawer is an envelope of 5 black and white drawings on heavy cards. I really like the two drawings of the castles. The front of the envelope has a picture of shell cottage but inside does not have the picture.

Another feature that I like about it is that when you lift anything to its bottom, the bottom has a nice design. The box is so heavy I basically have to slide or preferably wheel it around to different areas from one room to the next. I just like handling it. You could just find one place to put it and leave it.
  I'm glad to see that this is not replacing the ultimate Editions because it really wouldn't make any sense. I'm glad to see the Ultimate Editions out. I plan to get the last on. They have combined the two movies 7 and 8 together for the ultimate edition. This may be an alternative for those who can't afford this item. On the whole I like mine but wouldn't mind it being a little less expensive so that more people could afford it without having to go into debt to have it.

I changed the rating to from a 1 to a 4 because I do like it but not a five because it's too expensive. I think with the number of people who would want to buy it they could have made a good deal of money without having an inflated price.",1334361600,5,5305,4.193706981317601

5083625,1,B007FSEAHY,"I am a huge HP fan, and WB is spitting in all of the fans faces. I see no reason to buy this, there are no new deleted or extended scenes, no extended versions of the last 6 films (which going over all of the released deleted or extended scenes, 7 part 1, and part 2's could have easily been put back in for extended versions of the films), and all of the bonus content from the Ultimate Editions of 1-6 with nothing added it seems. I am clearly disappointed at not just the content but the OUTRAGEOUS price. Nice try WB but you won't be robbing me (or a lot of other fans) blind with this set.",1333929600,5,594,4.0423728813559325

5083627,1,B007FSEAHY,One of the most annoying parts of this lazy box set release is they're simply repackaging the dvd extra's that came with each of the movies.  Each movie release had different menus and styles for their extras.  All of these extras should have been pulled into 2-3 blu-rays for ease of navigation and upgraded to HD.  I can't even imagine how much of a pain it's going to be to switch between 12 extra disks and try to dig through different menu types in each on to find extras.,1333584000,5,477,4.337078651685394
5083628,1,B007FSEAHY,"I too own all of the movies in this collection already and in extended format, as well as quite  bit of the collectibles from the thenoblecollection.com . I also signed up for the harrypotterswizzardcollection.com and as to the site itself, well, I am not impressed. Why would I now go out and buy simple duplicates of what I already own simply for a few hours of commentary which is all the difference this collection makes so far as I can see. I am still not certain which collectibles may come with the set, but I own the map which has already been described as part of the attending collection and can see no reason to duplicate that either. I was very affronted to find out when this movie series came out, that Ms. Rowlings made part of the contract so that ONLY English actors could be in the movies. Although i love all of the actors in the movies, I don't see where it would have hurt to have a few American or other nationality actors star in the films as well. Especially given the fact that Americans are the biggest buyers of this whole series from books to memorabilia! VERY unworthy of Ms. Rowlings in that sense. Also, the fact that Ms. Rowlings, a former government aide/welfare recipient herself, would set her approval to such a rip-off, knowing that most all of her fans are children (which would make a large portion of her fans poor children who can ill afford such extravagant rip-off rubbish as this) of similar circumstances as she used to be, is not only a poor example but simple outright greed on her part. And, lest we forget, Warner Bros. is also  duplictous in this newest fiasco. I have spent many years (I am a grandma now) buying and re-buying my favorite movies from the original laser disc, to beta to VHS to DVD (and refuse to buy into the overpriced Blue Ray scheme of today) formats over the years which have costs me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I simply refuse to continue to waste money on more and more technology at this point. I have over 5,000 discs in my DVD collection and believe me, I am not rich. I just do not see any point to being further ripped off buy Ms. Rowlings or Warner Brothers. Enough is enough! It is time we ALL let them know it too!.

5083631,5,B007FSEAHY,"***update*** for those of you looking for the Ultimate edition 7&8, they are in one box set out now exclusive to Target until January 2013

Ok folks. We can go on and on about big bad Warner Bros. and how they are screwing us over with rehashes of the same content. First off, they aren't doing anything different than any of the other studios are doing. Every studio re-releases their movies in different formats all the time. No one is holding a gun to your head and making you buy it.

This is a box set collection. Box sets gather up all the previous material that has been issued before and collects it in a box. Hince the name ""BOX SET COLLECTION"". It is intended for the person that has not already bought all the movies separately to get them in one purchase. If you have already purchased these movies, which most of you have because you are Harry Potter fans, then don't buy this. You don't have to purchase every item that comes out with the Harry Potter name.

Regarding the Ultraviolet copies, what do you need those for if you are buying the blu rays of the movies?  If you want digital, go buy the digital versions from Amazon or Itunes. This is the lamest reason to not buy a box set I have ever heard.

As for the Ultimate Editions, Warner has already stated there will be announcements later this year for more releases. 7&8 will be coming out after September. The material is included here because 1) its a ""BOX SET COLLECTION"" and 2) as a reward to get the material a little early for spending $350 (which you know Amazon will lower the price closer to release, they always do. I'm thinking probably around $289.99). If you buy the Ultimate editions in Blu ray, that is $40 x 8 movies = $320. If they drop the price below $300 its actually a pretty good deal for what you get. And don't forget, there is a bonus disc in this set of content that is not on any other release (however they have not released the details on it yet).

Finally, to the people looking for the extended editions of movies 3-8, they are probably not going to come out on dvd/blu ray any time soon, as long as Warner Bros owns the rights to distribute these movies. Directors cuts of 6-8 were never even created, and the directors have stated that the original versions of 3-5 are their vision and how they want those movies to be seen. Warner Bros. is respecting the wishes of their directors. The only reason ABC family has extended versions is because it was part of the contract to get those movies on air. Warner Bros gave them exclusive rights to the deleted scenes and those versions were created by ABC family on their own. ABC family can not release those versions because they do not own the rights to distribute the movies, only to show them on their stations.

Bottom line, the material out is what you get. If you don't like the material included in this box, or already own most of it, then don't buy it. Warner Bros. isn't going to listen to your complaints. They listen to your wallets. For those of you who have not purchased the movies and want all the material out there collected in one package, this is the perfect release for you.",1333411200,22,3145,4.402753872633391

spend the extra money on something i really want but even i have my limits and its $349.99

5083643,3,B007FSEAHY,"I am very interested in a Complete boxed set including all the original theatrical and extended version releases, and I would LOVE for it to be Blue Ray, but realistically The Complete version of all the Harry Potter movies will not come out for at least two years when 4K resolution ""DVD's"" will be released along with 4K players and TV's, and then about four years later will be the ultimate ""video"" versions in 8K (the resolution that Digital ""films"" are projected in theatres today.)

So, do I WANT this boxed set?  Hell, yes!  Can I afford it? Actually, yes I can. Will I buy it? Well, since I am almost 60 and my hearing is crap and my eye sight getting blurry, what's the point in holding out for 4K or even 8K?

Is this a perfect boxed set? Of course not, and WB should NOT even mention the Ultraviolet Digital copy because it is a rip off...

If this boxed set were to include all the extended versions that have been shown on TV it would be worth ten stars, but it doesn't (Why???) so I would give it three stars, but I haven't even seen it yet!

And since I have sworn that I will not see HP IV-VII until I've read those books, it will be a long time...",1333152000,3,1164,4.197309417040358
5083644,5,B007FSEAHY,"First off I'd like to say, like everybody else that has reviewed this item so far, I have not actually purchased it, so, like everybody else, I'm not qualified to praise or criticize this item for any quality it ACTUALLY has. But from what I've seen in others' reviews, and from the details in the product description, I WOULD like to offer up some thoughts for consideration.

1. Has it never occurred to anyone that extended editions only exist for the first two films because those versions were sanctioned by the director/producers, and the others weren't? Who's to say that Prisoner of Azkaban or Order of the Phoenix, for which deleted scenes certainly do exist, weren't left the way they were because Cauron or Yates decided that they just didn't need them? Or that the ""extended"" editions you see on TV weren't actually put together by the WB, but by the TV station, by just inserting the deleted scenes in where they thought they fit best? (As in, NOT sanctioned by the director/producers?)

As long as these films are presented in the version that best represents the vision of the filmmakers, I'm all for it. That's why I can choose to pursue the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings or Blade Runner, AND be perfectly satisfied with the theatrical cuts presented here, and NOT be a hypocrite. :P

2. The set costs approx. $350 on Amazon. There are 31 discs, a mixture of Blu-Rays and DVDs (who needs Digital Copy when you've got the DVD, for crying out loud). When you do the math, that's about $11.30 per disc. Now, I regularly collect Japanese films from overseas (up to 120 films so far), and I know a steal when I see one, and THIS, my friends, is a STEAL.

And this is AFTER Amazon marked it down $150 from the list price. WB may not be your friend, but Amazon certainly is. :)

If you still think this is too expensive, here's a dose of reality for you: you can't expect the definitive collection of a 10-year-old, 8-film franchise to be cheap. It sucks, but there ya go.

In conclusion, after all is said and done, I will probably purchase this set for the memories and good times, and so I can be ACTUALLY qualified to review it. I just don't know if I'll pre-order it or wait for the release date...depends on how many angry rabid HP fans stay away from it (it is a limited edition, after all).",1333152000,9,2320,4.485781990521327
5083645,5,B007FSEAHY,"First, I cannot understand why Amazon would allow people to rate an item that has not even been released yet.
Second, I have to believe people submitting ratings here have yet to even see one of these for themselves and are therefor doing nothing but speculating on whether this is a good product. Seems to me most of the poor ratings come from people who are complaining about the high price.
Thank you Amazon and idiotic shoppers for verifying for me that the majority of customer reviews are completely worthless.
So, because I feel just as entitled as the next person to submit a nonsensical review on something I can't even get my hands on for another 5 months, I will give this product five stars.",1333152000,4,703,4.587301587301587

Does WB think the fans of this franchise are completely stupid? Please, spare me the retorts of ""that's just capitalism"": I present to you the Lord Of The Rings. Was this a ridiculously successful franchise? Yes. Was there a lot of gimmicky merchandise? Yes. BUT: did they release dozens of box sets, each containing only one or two extended cuts? No! They released the theatrical versions, the extended cuts, and the only real re-release was for Blu Ray, which was completely worthwhile for fans of the franchise.

I'm not going to waste another 2-5 years waiting for all extended cuts and THEN only buy the blu-ray for him. So what I did was I bought the normal blu-ray editions recently (just before you recall all them back), and having bought that, I have decided not to wait for any extended cuts and will never buy another Harry Potter box in ANY WAY!

I can survive without the extended cuts since I have the books. But that is really silly. If you have released all the extended cuts by now I would have bought it. LOTR released their extended cuts WAY FASTER THAN YOU :P

Come on WB, you can definitely do much better than this.
I like most HP fans have all the regular DVD's already, so by bumping the disc count on this set is just ridiculous. I think all HP fans should unite and boycott this cheap and poor excuse of a 'Box Set' attempt by WB just to make more money.

Just because the fans of Harry Potter shell out money for seeing each film multiple times, buy all the other merchandise, dvds, bluray, ultimate editions, tickets to the theme park and exhibitions... does not mean you can make whatever crappy quality set you want and put a huge price tag on it. You should have hired an amazing design team to make something that was worth the quality of what the Harry Potter sets look like instead of this oversized shoe box. And give us real extended editions instead of holding out for more money in years to come. Those ultraviolet ""copies"" are a joke. If I can't put it on my ipad and use it on the plane or road trip without internet that is just a ripoff. The first few in the ultimate editions were actual copies then you started ripping us off. I think we have waited long enough thanks.

I am willing to pay good money for good quality. I have been a loyal fan and customer. I have all the dvds, ultimate editions, artwork books, soundtracks, tshirts, went to the Universal theme park, saw the exhibition in Boston and NY, and I am planning on going to see the studios in London.

I don't know about any of the movies being shown or actually existing in extended editions on cable other than the first two, so I'm not upset by only getting the theatrical release that I am familiar with for the other films. This release should consist of 8 Blu Ray discs of movies in their absolute best quality/version with an option to watch the theatrical or extended version for movies 1 and 2 and 8-10 Blu Ray discs for the special features. That's still 26 discs which is a lot but at least they are all Blu Ray and maybe charge $200.",1332720000,6,1015,4.291666666666667

Drop the DVD versions because no one's going to use them since they're buying the collection for the Blu-Ray versions. I understand this is just a way for WB to get out from under all the inventory they've got left of the DVD's, but it's useless to the fans. Create a DVD only version for those who only have a DVD player. And of course, where in the world are the extended editions of the other 6 movies?!

I am the Harry Potter nerd of my friends group, I own the books and I've purchased every DVD minus the Deathly Hallow  DVDs because I assumed they would be releasing a full box set and I would be looking at a $200-$250 price tag. I would be willing to pay that or higher for ""that limited edition box set"" but this thing seems to be a rip off more so when you see the French releases of the resin Hogwarts and the deathstick.  There's a review of I think 4stars right in the beginning part of the reviews section by Jason where he breaks down the entire set and it's worth. He seems to take his Harry Potter very seriously like most of us do and makes a very valid point.

LIKELY this whole pre-order idea is a way to test the waters and see how many people will buy it, after all the inventiveness behind the box is ingenious the problems being, it looks incredibly cheap and wouldn't surprise me one bit if only a few of the compartments actually opened. My reasoning for the 5 star review is that I am thankful that this story is getting the attention to attempt such an extravagant set because the fans want it. Harry Potter wasn't just another book to people it was bigger than that. Personally I would want something that stands these DVDs out amongst my other DVDs because of my love for the series and if I'm spending $350 it better be pretty damn awesome.

So to conclude my mad ramblings, Warner Brothers, step your game up and your going to sell plenty,but if you don't all of those 1star folks (who I'm guessing are here because like me they have ordered from you and were given the early heads up about this because they are willing to collect.)

However, upon reading all the other reviews, I realised how true their comments are. I wouldn't mind spending that much money if it's actually worth it, but truthfully, it's not. Why are there only extended cuts for the first 2 movies, instead for all of them? Because that is what we Harry Potter fans actually WANT. The series is over, so just GIVE us the most complete set ever to be made instead of gradually making different sets to rip us all off. All I'm saying is, just make another limited and numbered edition, with a beautiful design like this one, complete with all the extended cuts and special editions ever made on the Harry Potter movies (and I mean ALL of them!) and of course, the collectibles wouldn't hurt either.

For more casual fans who just want to own all the movies, there is already a box set that's about $300 cheaper than this!

5083729,1,B007FSEAHY,"I am with everyone and advise all HP fans to stear clear of this box set. A similar consumer Amazon protest happened when the Lord of the Rings was originally released on Blu-ray - the theatrical versions were released first in a box set, followed by the extended editions + digital copies about a year later. Needless to say, the theatrical editions were rallied against because there was no point in releasing a theatrical edition first and no extended edition, as it was an obvious attempt to make money off of fans only to have them purchase ANOTHER box set later on.

The same goes for this series. While the box is gorgeous, and it's pretty overwhelming to get 13 discs of special features, you KNOW that extended versions exist for all HP films, not just the first two. So why only release extended editions of the first 2 films? If these extended versions were aired and watched my millions on the ABC Family channel, what is keeping them from being released on this box set? Not only that, but what is with the Ultraviolet ""digital"" copies, which aren't digital copies at all that can be saved on Itunes and in a harddrive folder, but instead a streaming service that has a time limit of 3 years before it's deleted. Gimme a break. I'd rather have NO digital copies than this Ultraviolet rip-off.

I for one will not be spending $350 for only 5 hours of new bonus features (give me a break). Actually, Warner Bros. should be held accountable for misleading the public over the fact that they said & advertised that they would be releasing the ultimate editions of all of the movies with extended cuts, but in reality they only released the first six films and only the first 2 had extended cuts.

I have read where the may be legal issues preventing the  extended releases of all the films after Chamber... Admittedly, I'am no legal expert, but if the extended versions can't be released on home video, how can they be shown on ABC Family?!? I don't understand that. So despite the fancy packaging, and all the bonus extras, this advertises, unless the details change between now and the release date, and the extended versions are in fact included (which I guess could happen, but I won't be holding my breath), I will skip this set, and continue to wait, and hold out hope that the extended versions will someday be released.",1331424000,111,1245,4.684931506849315

Another reviewer has a link for Amazon.fr which shows the French collection in an awesome glass in silver box with hogwart's seal & the Elder Wand atop the case. A past Harry Potter collection was in the base of a Full Replica of the entire Hogwart's castle! But in the great USA we get a painted box with repackaged movies, most of which I already own.

5083739,5,B007FSEAHY,"Ok, I get it.  It is a very very high price especially if you have already bought the ultimate editions of the 6 movies and the best possible editions of 7 and 8. For those who did that, that was your choice. You have already invested 220 to 300+ dollars knowing they would come out with a collector's edition someday. Surely you did not think this edition, with 5 hours of new material would be priced close to or lower than all of the Ultimate editions combined!? But you had the pleasure of seeing them right away as they came out.  It would have driven you crazy to wait. Think of the joy and anticipation you would have missed as you opened your ultimate editions and popped them in your Blu-ray Players. Personally, I only have blu-rays for 6, 7, and 8, and not the ultimate blu-ray for 6. I did get the 2 volume special editions of the DVDs before I got my blu-ray player and I had to get one of them from the U.K. because it was out of print in the U.S.  Quite Simply, I absolutely adore extras and I can't wait to see the first 5 movies in Blu-Ray. I can't wait to see the 5 hours of new material + all of the extras I didn't get by not buying the ultimate editions. I love the box. I really do not understand all of the weeping and wailing over the lack of extended versions of movies 3 through 8. The extended versions of the first 2 only added 7 minutes and 13 minutes to the movies. Big deal. The only thing I am ""worried"" about is if someday they come out with the movies with even more extras like the devoutly to be wished director's/actors commentaries.  But who knows when that might be, if ever?  I locked my price in yesterday at 350.00. Who knows? I still might cancel depending on what I find out later. I don't spend that kind of money lightly. But it looks like they must be getting a lot of pre-orders if they have since raised the price $100.00.

I wasn't expecting something for nothing. But I was expecting something. SOMEthing. The only way this set seems like a good idea is if you don't already OWN the movies AND it ends up being cheaper than buying the movies individually (it's currently about 4.5 times more than all 8 movies, alone).

First we got the heads up for the ULTIMATE editions of eight movies in the period of time, but this period of time showed us no mercy and proved that the ""ULTIMATE"" word goes only for the first and the second movie!

Second; the unbelievable release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-The-Complete-8-Film-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005OCFHHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection [Blu-ray</a>] was announced with nothing more but movies; but we thought, ""OK!... This is just a little THEATRICAL COLLECTION for those who have not owned them, YET!""

Third; WB released ""Harry Potter: The Definitive collection"" Teaser, and we started dreaming of an unbelievable magic would appear through that thrilling light, of course after the OSCARs!

Then Academy Awards excludes Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows Part2 from all those nominees, including ""Best Picture"" and I went to bed in tears after the show ended in that cursed night! (No offense to other motion pictures.)

And now this...
Wizards collection.
I admire all your efforts, WB, for giving us the most lovely series of the decade and for that alongside the books, this is us calling ourselves ""Harry Potter Generations""! But this pack is just a recollection for Ultimate Editions and other merchants over the time the epic was released! We over-watched the movies we own on DVD/BD and we were expecting a pack could get us with EXTENDED CUTs sitting more in front of the screen.

""Creating the world of Harry Potter"" attached in the Harry Potter Ultimate Editions are the special features I enjoyed to watch and I don't think I'm gonna pay more for another ridiculous pack including them, again!

Adjective:
Being or happening at the end of a process; final: ""their ultimate aim was to force his resignation"".
Noun:
The best achievable or imaginable of its kind: ""the ultimate in decorative luxury"".

BTW - I am quite sure  that any ""extra unseen"" material will hit the internet one way or another, so no need to buy this over-priced item just to get it.

I might as well add, if someone has younger kids and has NOT yet bought all or most of the Harry Potter films on DVD or Blueray...this might be a great item to get for them. But I suspect most folks either can't afford to shell out a wad of money to buy all the films at once, or, like myself, have already invested too much money in the Ultimate Editions to blithely replace them with this box set.

I do believe the price is on the high side thus loosing a star.
The editions included do appear to be the best available anywhere at any price. A proper disk for disk comparison reveals a significant premium on this package, but here's what I have found:
1. The extended cuts aren't generally available new.
2. The extended cuts aren't available on bluray at any price/anywhere. (Not even though ""alternate"" illegal markets, Is this their first release?)
3. The 3d versions aren't in the ""complete"" bluray sets that are out there. (Yes I have a 3d home theater.)
4. I have not had problems with other UV downloads before.
5. I think it's a strong chance that there are actual digital copy codes included, that's not explicit, but it does say ""digital copy"" in the primary titling.
6. I kind of hope they didn't bother with digital copy disks, they are junk after install, I'd rather save the trash and just download the movies with the code.
7. There are likely to be extended cuts of the other movies out someday, I'm not waiting forever though. (They are not available at any price/anywhere contrary to what some reviews have implied on here, ""ultimate editions are packaging, not extended versions.)
8. I like the collectors packaging.

First, off, don't be fooled by 31 discs.  It pisses me off when studios advertise the amount of discs, as if that means anything.  Remember, half those disc are dvd and half are blu ray.  Which means that half of them are completely useless to you, because you have either replaced all your dvd players with blu ray by now or you are one of the two percent of people that are still stuck in the primitive age.

The only reason this collection should be is 31 discs is if half were blu ray theater cuts and half were blu ray extended cuts. Yet we are disappointed once again, because only the first two movies have the extended cuts included.  wtf. What is possibly holding them back besides money grubbing and the good ole double dip bull crap studios pull.

Any one else reminded of the infamous Lord of the Rings Blue ray set double dip? Looks like Warner Brothers wants to follow in the footsteps of New Line Cinemas.

I'm not even going to mention the price tag..... Guys, do yourself a favor and don't buy this. You KNOW this isn't the best Warner Brothers can do.  Later down the road they are going to release a complete set with all extended cuts and hopefully more special features. Don't let them scam you out of your money twice.

Far too often have I purchased ""limited edition"" collector box sets, only to find they are made of cheap plastic or cardboard.
Hopefully, Warner will put the effort and time into this set, and make it of a more durable and LONG-LASTING material, like OH, I dunno....WOOD.
Also, I hope a lot of thought goes into how the discs are stored/packaged, because again, most of these releases usually fail epically when it
comes to disc storage.

5083787,1,B007FSEAHY,"THIS ... IS ... A ... LIE !!!!!! Not all will be revealed, in fact, I wouldn't even bother marketing this useless box at all. This product is the result of an 8 BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT; so I think it is quite fair to say that this collection is an outright INSULT to every Harry Potter fan in the world.

Let's start with the books which are amazing and probably because it was only JK Rowling who pieced together this story and had nothing to do with WB. Now let's move to the movie adaptations, the director's did a great job for 1 - 4 ... the director for 5 - 8 did a terrible job (and I mean PATHETIC job) on the films, not to mention making the longest book (OOTP) into the shortest movie with 45 minutes cut, and then making the final book into 2 parts, without really giving us real action. Like that wasn't punishment enough?! WB started releasing many versions of each movie (1 disc edition, 2 disc edition, ultimate edition etc), and multiple editions of box sets (1-3 set; 1-5 set; the 1-5 trunk; 1-8 set etc); which okay, if you've purchased all these movie's already, really there is no need to buy the Wizard's Collection ... but in the meantime WB have profited PLENTY of money from those who actually bought the movies previously... so now to come out with one final box set known as the Wizard's Collection, you'd think it would be one-tenth decent.

Don't be silly ... keep milking the consumer's; double ... triple ... quadruple dipping into our wallets. The fact that this set has memorabilia in it, is enough for me to want to buy this; but come on, why don't WB give the fans what we're asking for and what we really want to have?! Most people I'm sure would be happy to fork out half a grand if you knew WB was really giving you everything. But they're not. Why can't WB thank their HP fans for making Harry Potter the biggest grossing franchise ever, by releasing these movies with extended versions? I have read other comments / reviews where people have said something along the lines of: ""stop complaining!"" or ""don't get it if you have the movies already"" or ""you knew WB would release an ultimate box set eventually"" ... like saying this in your review means you should be giving this product 5 stars - how is that justified?! Why are you giving the product 5 stars??? And you know what '5 star reviewers'; people have every right to complain as much as they want about a product that my great-great-great-unborn-grandchild could have made with their hands tied behind their backs and their eyes sealed shut. We're going to be paying HALF A GRAND for this box set ... we should be complaining!

Now let's talk about the mixture of DVD, Blu-ray and ultra-violet :s :S :s THIS MAKE'S NO SENSE!
Let's take Movie 3 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as an example:
Four discs include:
1) Theatrical version on Blu-ray
2) Theatrical version on DVD
3) Special Features on DVD
4) Creating the World of Harry Potter - Part 3: Creatures on Blu-ray

According to this description, there are no special features on Blu-ray. And `Creating the World of Harry Potter' documentary isn't playable on DVD ... WTH?! I know this may be a very little thing, but its things like this that are meant to make the WIZARD'S COLLECTION the best Harry Potter box set ever! Someone who is paying this amount of money would want to watch the extra's, but are limited to what content they can watch based on their home entertainment player. Also no extended edition. I don't believe that the biggest grossing franchise of all time really can't make this happen. Thousands of people have waited the 10 years for this kind of set (whether you bought the movies previously or not) and are still getting a SLAP ON THE FACE - FREE OF CHARGE WITH THIS PRODUCT. Going back to the mixture of discs, release 2 editions - one with only DVDs and one with only Blu-rays. DVD discs cost nearly nothing to make so why this is overpriced is beyond me. Extend those movies and WB will notice more people actually buying this. It's a necessary change.

Let's go back to my title ... ""all that has been hidden is now destined to be revealed"" OH PLEASE x10000. What a massive marketing fib. The extended cuts of 3 - 8 are still hidden!

`Bonus Disc' exclusive to the Wizard's Collection.
What a SNOOZE-FEST, like one disc of unseen content justifies the price-tag and the pretty cardboard box and the other discs' already seen content ranging from 6 months to 10 years old.

Exclusive memorabilia... The `Label Collection' and the `Catalogue of Artefacts'. I know these collector books are exclusive to the set, but exclusive content? ... I don't think so. If you have Film Wizardry and Page to Screen, you'll know that most of what is inside these already owned books will re-appear in the Label Collection and Catalogue of Artefacts. These two books can be a bit of a joke and are useless to the buyer. I'm not sure how this is good?

If i were JK.R, I'd be absolutely EMBARASSED at how WB has insulted fans with this pathetic box. JK gave the fans Pottermore FOR FREE... she truly wanted to thank her fans for where she is today. WB have profited BILLIONS and while I understand you've got to pay something for this box set... give us SOMETHING WORTH IT, or is this how WB want to thank their fan base?
The only information we don't know about this box, is what the remaining 4 or 5 exclusive movie memorabilia items are. I'm finding it very hard to justify spending this amount of money on these exclusive extras, which I'm sure, did not cost much to make to begin with.

I also know for a FACT that WB are listening and reading our comments; cause when the box first came out the house colours were incorrect and mixed up on the inside lid, and since a lot of people noticed and pointed it out, it has since been fixed up to represent the correct house colours. NOW YOU HEAR US ALL LOUD AND MAGICALLY CLEAR - GIVE US EXTENDED CUTS. Not just deleted scenes added in, but actual unseen footage and we know you have heaps of it.

One other thing is the price, from the first movie 10 years ago, to the last about 6 months ago now (since its DVD/Blu-ray release), $349 does not justify the cost at all - and that's a sale price! If you were to buy the oldest movie to the most current, in total you would be looking at $140 tops, even in a `normal' box set. So really you're looking at about $210 (or $360 when not on sale) for the extra exclusive memorabilia (which so far has not grabbed my attention in the slightest), and an extra 5 hours of new footage in a pretty looking box. That's disgusting. This set should be $300 at full price (a fair price tag I think, with WB still making a extra for their pockets).

Based on all that I've said, what do I rate this?! Zero? No ...less than zero. I've been a bit nice, and will rate this item a 1 star because I can't rate this product lower than that here.

Here is a Summary:
* This Collection contains all of the Ultimate Blu-ray sets plus 8 DVD movies. That's 31 disks total.
* The ""5 hours of unreleased extra features"" are the 2 extra features disks that would be in the Ultimate sets for movie 7 part 1 and 2. Those haven't been released yet so the statement is technically correct.
[UPDATE]
WB.com lists the new features as being:
""The Harry Potters You Never Met"" tricks behind the major stunts in the series.
Deathly Hallows Part 1 Bonus Disc""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Pt. 7: Story""
Deathly Hallows Part 2 Bonus Disc ""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Pt. 8: Growing Up"" and
Extended ""A Conversation with JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe"" with 15 minutes of new footage

* The first two movies are extended (by 7 and 13 minutes) and the last two come in 3D. Everything else is the standard Blu-ray release of the films.
* There is an 8 part documentary created by WB that you can get one part at a time in the Ultimate sets or in it's entirety in this Wizards Collection. That's the bulk of the new extra features.
* The box appears to be cardboard. Really cool and fancy cardboard. They are trying to make it collectible by making it a ""limited and numbered edition"". As far as I can tell, there is nothing offered (the box or the special contents) that actually makes the set a collectible. It says you get a map too, but you can already buy those.
* If you REALLY like extra features, little picture books, 3D, and don't own any of the Ultimate sets then you will find the value of this collection to be... Okay.
* It's about $50 more than buying all the Ultimate sets individually.
* Look at the box sets released in France and you will either want to cry or punch someone when you realize how much better they are. I am not joking. ([...])
* WB states: ""Check back to this product detail page for further details."" -- [UPDATE] the WBshop just posted the same set with a new picture. It shows and bunch of cards and books and paper things as the collectible memorabilia, but doesn't list it out by in detail. [...]

If you are sitting there with money in hand and want to know what you are getting, read on. The rest of you can probably stop here unless you are a real Potter movie geek. I hate spending money and not knowing what I will get. This review is intended to answer that with a detailed analysis as the title suggests. I might be wrong in some places, but until WB releases more information, this is the best I can offer.

********************************************

I'll admit, I have been waiting for this set to be released. I bought the Harry Potter 7 book set when all of the books were printed and I intended to do the same thing when all the movies had been released. I do already own the movies. It's a hodge-podge set that inclused mostly DVD's and some Blu-ray that I purchased as each movie came out. There are even a few pre-viewed ones in there from the local video store. I think like most people looking at this set, I already own the movies on DVD.

I don't mind repurchasing them as, like I mentioned, I intended to get a nicely done complete set. The ""all 8 movie complete set"" released in 2011 didn't cut it though, those were just the movies and I have been waiting for the ""ultimate edition box set"" with all the extras and extended cuts. If you want all 8 movies on blu-ray, it can be had for $80 right now. The DVD set is $50. You only get 8 discs, just the movies. You won't get any all the extras and no extended editions with those sets. The general consensus when they were released was, ""don't bother, there is a better set coming"".

The information on the contents of the discs in the ultimate ""Wizard's Set"" here is sparse, but lets take a closer look. The content description says, ""Contains 31 discs, inclusive of all content ever previously released"" and I can only assume it is basically the combined box set of all the previous ultimate sets.

(As far as I can tell though, that doesn't mean the Full screen versions, thank goodness.)

I'll break down what was previously released and I think some logical conclusions will arise about what is in this box set. It appears that this compiles all of the Ultimate Edition Blu-ray sets you can currently buy plus some new extra features.

Disc 4 - Original DVD release

The first two movies have extended versions, though it doesn't sound extrememly notable like the extended LOTR. Sorcerer's Stone gets 7 extra minutes and Chamber of Secrets gets 13 extra minutes.

The last two movies Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2 are the only movies with 3-D versions.

From what I have read, the original WB press release on the individual ""ultimate"" sets claimed that each film was going to get extended cuts, but only Chris Columbus added these. Plans to extend the rest seemed to have been cut due to director interference and budget issues. I wouldn't look for this any time soon (ever?). Which is a shame.

There seems to be an 8-part documentary series called ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" that was released one section at a time with each ultimate set. The last two ultimate sets haven't been released. I can only assume the last two parts of the documentary would be in this Wizards Collection.

Unfortunately, unlike the UK release, this does not contain a digital copy. It is an ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"". You can find more information on this online, but basically it is a streaming service you sign up for and add the movies to using a code. It requires an internet connection to use.

For extra features, as far as I can tell, movies 1-5 went to DVD first, the Blu-ray versions were introduced years later. The ultimate sets included a new BD with new extra features and then included the original DVD ""disc 2"" with the old extra features. Starting with movie 6, Half-Blood Prince, the extras were on BD and DVD. However, compare the ""2 disc Blu-ray"" and ""3 disc DVD"" sets. The Blu-ray set combined both the old DVD extras and the new BD extras into a single BD disc. That will be important below.

This new box set ""Contains 31 discs, inclusive of all content ever previously released, in addition to over 5 hours of never before seen special features. 18 movie discs""

Assuming they release the same discs as were used in the previous ultimate releases:
2 - BD with movie and extended cuts
6 - BD with movie
2 - BD 3-D print for the last two movies
Then add:
8 - Original DVD movies
= 18 movie discs

Now that leaves 13 discs for the extra features.
I count 13 extra features discs in the sets above. That's 8 BD and 5 DVD.

Remember, this new wizard set is boasting ""over 5 hours of never before seen special features"". That will likely be composed of a few hours of the last two parts of the 8 part documentary series plus something else. I had though the extra 5 hours would just be a new disc for the Wizard Collection. After looking closely at what WB did with the Half-Blood Prince Ultimate 2 disc set, I changed my mind.

It just says ""5 hours"" of new unreleased special features. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 ultimate sets have not been released, but I think they already have the new special features Blu-ray disc produced that would appear in the ultimate sets and just like with movie 6, it would combine all the extras into a single disc. This disc will replace the old BD disc released with the previous Blu-ray sets for movie 7 and would have new material. Namely Parts 7 and 8 of the documentary series they had been releasing. Those two discs together will contain the 5 extra hours of new features in this Wizard Collection. That still adds up to 13 discs so the math works out as well.

[update]
WB.com lists this info: (direct quote)
Nearly 4 hours of features including: All New! ""The Harry Potters You Never Met"" - Watch how thrilling stunts from the films were performed, and learn about the tricks behind the major stunts in the series.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 Bonus Disc o Over 2 hours of features including: All New! ""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Pt. 7: Story""  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 Bonus Disc o Over 4 hours of features including: All New! ""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Pt. 8: Growing Up"" and All New! Extended ""A Conversation with JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe"" with 15 minutes of new footage.

The digital copy won't be on a disc. That appears to be all contained within the Ultraviolet streaming service.

Extras:
The ultimate sets already released had a series of small 44-48 page books that coordinated with the part of the extra features documentary released with each movie.

The Wizard Collection information set currently says, ""Includes multiple specially-produced, collectable [their typo] memorabilia items, including concept art, a Map of Hogwarts and much more! Check back to this product detail page for further details.""
[UPDATE]
The WBshop posted the same set with a new picture showing the extras. It looks like books, postcards, and other flat printed material. There are no detailed descriptions.

I'll assume that will contain the books. Possibly the cards from the above ultimate sets. Plus a ""map of hogwarts"" which could really only be a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-Marauder-s-Map/dp/B0026PW67W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter Marauder's Map</a>. But it might not be as large as the ones on amazon and thinkgeek, who knows? warnerbros.com has no Marauder's Map for sale on their site any more, I can only assume they pulled all of their stock because it went to this box set release?

You do get the neat fold-out box to contain everything. As far as I can tell, this is high quality printed cardboard/paperboard. I have two issues with it: 1) you can't get to the movies if there is anything around the box, such as other movies on a shelf. 2) from the pictures, it looks like the drawers are much too wide for the DVD's contained within and I expect to see lots of wasted space.

===============================

Having said all that, do I think it is worth the money? Well $350 is a lot for this set. The $500 list price is a joke, it is set that high so they can mark it down.

WB has previsouly released some of these movies over a dozen times in different forms and I think 99% of the people looking at this set already have some or all of the movies, probably the early ones on DVD. Unlike when Star Wars was released on Blu-ray, all of these have already been out on Blue-ray and in 3D and the two extended editions can be found individually. There needs to be enough new value to make the set worth it.

If I wanted to buy all 6 of the ultimate sets plus the two 4 disc with 3-D sets of movie 7 that I linked at above, right now today (March 2, 2012) from Amazon, it would cost me $312. They range from $35-$50 a set. If the last two 3D versions dropped in price from about $50 to $35 to match the rest of them, then you are looking at about $280. Used sets and shopping around might lower that more. This could be even cheaper if you don't want 3D, and a lot of people don't judging on 3D TV sales.

That $312 is almost the price of this ultimate wizards set. The wizards set adds value with the fancy storage box, the 5 hours of new extra features, and a map (plus possibly something they haven't announced).

If you just want the movies, you can get all 8 for $80 on Blu-ray or $50 on DVD.

If you just want the extended movies, you can buy the ultimate sets of movies 1 and 2 for less than $40 each.

The digital copies (ultraviolet streaming service) are a joke and I don't consider them to be adding any value at all.

The lack of extended versions really hurts the value of this box set in my mind. The only real added value are the new BD extra features and the fancy box.

If you really like extra features, I am going to have to say that despite the really high price, it is about the same as buying all the ultimate sets up individually and might be worth the money. The Ultimate sets and Wizards Collection will have 8 BD worth of extra features not seen on the 2 disc DVD and BD releases (assuming they release the ultimate sets for the last two movies). However, I am not seeing a lot of value added over what I already own. I have the last two movies in Blu-Ray and could get the first 6 ultimate sets for $210 and be pretty happy. I would only be missing out on 5 hours of extra features, a box, the map, and 3D version of the last two movies. I would be paying $140 less than the current pre-order price for this Wizard Set.

If you don't like extras, but want Blu-Ray, you can get those movies for $80 and if you have all of the 2 disc DVD collections you will have 20 of the 31 discs contained in this set.

At $350 for the Wizard set, you are paying $43 for each ultimate set. Or to put that another way, if you could find each ultimate set for $35 and bought 8 of them, you would be paying the extra $70 for the fancy box and map contained in this Wizard Collection.

Realistically, if this new wizards set was around $250 I would consider it a good value (that would be like getting each ultimate set for $31 and a free extra storage box). Box sets like these are generally expected to have some bulk savings over buying everything individually, but I think WB is looking to create a collectors item and raise the price, even though the contents don't warrant that treatment. To make it a real collectors item, there needs to be something here besides the cardboard storage box that you can't get anywhere else. In the current announcement, there isn't.

At the $350 price I am more wary about the purchase. At $500 I wouldn't even consider the purchase.  Even though I waited to buy this set, I don't know if I will. Perhaps a more detailed official announcement with details making it sound like an actual collectible item will sway my decision.

==============================

One last thing. They really could have made the box nicer. I don't mean that as wishful thinking. Check out what was ALREADY released in France (for about $250 USD). Both of these, even now, can be found second hand for around $500USD plus import shipping.

A wooden box with a drawer on front to hold the movies (no folding out sides) and a stand for holding the Elder wand (included). Also all 8 films in Blu-ray and 3 bonus discs. This set is classy and I really wish I could have one.

3) Director's cut of Order of the Phoenix.  Sorry- I'm not buying another Harry Potter disc until I see this.

4) Digital Copy.  The description promises ""UltraViolet Digital Copy"" which is a misrepresentation and WB should be sued for it.  There is no COPY.  There is a digital stream which requires signing up for another service (UltraViolet) and you cannot watch it without an internet connection.  It is not a digital copy.

The above is what it would take for me to buy any new HP sets.  Certainly no less.  They have padded this with both Blu-ray and DVD copies to add more discs, plus 3-D version of DH2, and the only new content is some special features.  Basically, you probably own everything in this box already except the 5 hours of new features.
