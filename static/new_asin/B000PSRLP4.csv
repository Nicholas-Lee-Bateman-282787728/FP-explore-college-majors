8193150,3,B000PSRLP4,"Over all Prior to The I Am has a few good things to impart, but it is very repetitious and slightly annoying - at least to me. The video could be summed up as: anything we can conceptualize, imagine, dream up, or in any way think of, is not the real. Even the Witness, the I AM is bound within the confines of dichotomy, and so, cannot be the Ultimate Truth.

While Stephen attempts to conceptually grasp that Real, that Prior to the I AM business, what we end up getting is two hours of constant bombardment against other systems with classical clichs such as time before time, what self existed before the self arose, what hearing is there before ears evolved, seeing before the eyes, and so forth. Of course there is no self before the self, no thing before no-thing. Could thought exist before the thinking apparatus (brain, nerves, microchip, etc...) existed: chicken and the egg.

The simple answer to Stephen's incessant question, ""who are we prior to the I AM"" is no-one, or two, three, four, mind/body, consciousness, space, time, energy, matter, emptiness, idea, concept, etc... We couldn't even be nothing, for nothing implies something as our minds so eloquently conceives it.

While I agree with Sri Nisargadatta's teachings as I understand them, I personally feel Stephen overly intellectualizing them, which feels more like selling us snake oil rather than imparting a genuine understanding of Nisargadatta's teachings.

If you can get the video via the library, online, or borrow it from a friend, it is worth the watch. Otherwise, don't waste your money on it. Visit my website for further notes and thoughts on video.

8193152,5,B000PSRLP4,"Rare is it indeed in my experience that I find a topic so well covered as this one is.  Wolinsky's discourses are a very thorough, detailed presentation of Advaita as best as you're apt to find anywhere.  The meditations are effective but I had acquired them on a CD prior to getting this DVD(the only new here is the twenty minute dichotomy presentation).

I also own DVD4 and it too is such a thorough exposition of the topic.",1224374400,2,428,4.461538461538462
8193153,5,B000PSRLP4,"This video features Stephen Wolinsky serving up his understanding of Nisargadatta Maharaj's most profound teachings. Two points of power are noted in this DVD. One is Nisargadatta Maharaj's confession of the primordial advaita. The other is 9 minutes of footage of Nisargadatta speaking to a group of people in his home.

POINT OF POWER 1 - THE PRIMORDIAL ADVAITA

In this video teacher Stephen Wolinsky says that Nisargadatta called ""prior to the I Am"" the primordial advaita. Stephen says, ""Even the sense of beingness as well as presence, and witnessing, awaring, is part of the I Am and an illusion. Prior to the I am, in the primordial advaita, they are not.""

The primordial advaita is a power point because there's nowhere else to go from there. It is ""prior to."" Today's teachings that are classified as neo-advaita speak from ""prior to."" Primordial advaita is Nisargadatta's version of neo-advaita.

""My words, if planted in you, will remove all other words and concepts,"" Nisargadatta said. That's all neo-advaita confessions or the confessions of ""prior to,"" of primordial advaita, can do. And they can do it. This DVD can do it.

Primordial advaita is a power point within this production. Through Wolinsky's explanations and meditations, you are brought to where you can confess the primordial advaita yourself, if you are inclined to.

If Nisargadatta's words can become planted in you, or have become planted in you, then Wolinsky is like a growth stimulator of planted words, whether the gardener was Nisargadatta, Tony Parsons, Bob Adamson, or anyone. Any guru. We learn from Nisargadatta in his own words that, ""Gurus are like milestones. It is natural to move from one to another.""

Primordial advaita, or ""prior to the I Am,"" is one thematic power point.

POWER POINT 2 - FILM OF NISARGADATTA MAHARAJ:

The other notable power point consists of nine minutes of footage of Nisargadatta Maharaj speaking to a group of men and women. This film takes the DVD out of the hands of Wolinsky and leaves you with Nisargadatta himself.

I thought the 9 minutes with Nisargadatta was very much like being with him. He was speaking to a roomful of Indian men and women. There was no translator, so the interaction seemed more direct, relaxed, and naturally paced. The natural sounds within the room, Nisargadatta's voice, the noises from busy street outside added to the reality and intimacy. The subtitles are very good. I love how Nisargadatta laughed with the people as though something common was shared about being human. I sensed that in his laughter Nisargadatta revealed all ""this"" as a humor-evoking magic trick.

OTHER POINTS OF POWER:

--Wolinsky addresses these comments by Nisargadatta which we see him speaking in authentic footage: ""You have faith that you are. On what does it depend on? The faith that you are ... nobody investigates on these lengths. Why is there beingness? How am I? Why am I? On what does it depend on?""

--You may have sudden insights, as when Wolinsky tells you, ""Even the space between two thoughts is not it. Actually, the space between two thoughts and the thoughts themselves are made of the same substance.""

--I enjoyed the discourse on truthiness: ""Truthiness is a satirical term coined by Stephen Colbert in reference to the quality by which a person claims to know something intuitively, instinctively, or `from the gut' without regard to evidence, logic, facts, or intellectual examination. Truthiness is used as an appeal to emotion and comfort."" (Wikipedia). Wolinsky says, ""What gurus say feels good but you need to differentiate between what they're saying and what you're feeling. First, is the information accurate? Faith is not enough."" Later on, he says, ""People fall in love with their perception of the personality. Most people don't know the teacher and the teacher doesn't know them. They don't know what's going on in the guru's life. You're missing the point by attracting to the teacher, the sadhana, the practices.""

--Deconstructing Deconstruction: Wolinsky teaches, ""Witnessing, beingness, awareness, and presence are all functions of the I Am; they either happen or they do not. They are not you. The are `states' which are I Am dependent, and hence illusions to be discarded.""

--Meditations. There are a few meditations through which you are led by Wolinsky. Here is a fragment of one on deconstructing deconstruction:

""Without using your thoughts, your memory, your emotions, your associations, your perceptions, is there a logos, no logos or neither? Notice the knower or awarer or the witness of the logos/no logos, source/no source dichotomy, and the witness. What happens if the witness or the knower of the logos/no logos dichotomy, and the dichotomy itself happen through a biochemical reaction in the abstraction process, but there are no chemicals?"" He repeats this meditation with several other dichotomies, such as path, plan, purpose, self, emptiness, void. At end he says, to ""keep part of your awareness `back there' beyond knowing, beyond yes and no. When you open your eyes part of your awareness can be here.""

CONCLUSION:

Stephen Wolinsky is brilliant in two ways in this DVD. First, he goes as far as any teaching can go, it seems, by deconstructing deconstruction. Second, he's not simply confessing the ""state"" of primordial advaita, as neo-advaitins do, or as the Avadhuta Gita does, a scripture he refers to at the end of the video; he's explaining the primordial advaita very, very carefully, repetitively, clearly, borrowing seriously from Nagarjuna's eight negations. He's leading you to the experience of primordial advaita through meditations. There is no state and no experience of primordial advaita, but those words are used.

There are four DVDs in the Nisargadatta/Wolinsky series. If you are comfortable with the teachings of the Avadhuta Gita and you don't mind hearing that the witness, the `source', the I Am are illusions to be discarded, then start with this DVD. Watch all four if you want a penetrating course in nonduality, the essence of advaita, and the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj.

8193154,2,B000PSRLP4,"Howdy....the short footage of Sri Sri Nityananda [approx 2 minutes] although of poor quality, is priceless. The footage of Nisargadata Maharaj if fabulous.

The actual discourse by Dr. Wolinsky, for me, is just a bunch of blah, blah, blah. The words of the great beings cannot be improved upon in a discourse.

For me, all I want is to see and hear the Great Beings and there's not enough of that here for my money.",1219190400,2,415,4.52
8193155,5,B000PSRLP4,"Prior To The I Am is part 3 of the series ""I Am That I Am"".  This is yet another rich and generous 2.5 hour program on Non Duality from NETI NETI FILMS. The packaging is in gorgeous color beholding the image of a Buddha.  This series has been praised by three of Nisargadata Maharaj's translators and even his film maker. Maharaj referred to the Prior to the I Am as ""The Primordial Advaita"". This presentation has 13 new lectures, 20 minutes of meditation, and newly discovered film footage of Nityananda and S.N.Maharaj.  Stephen Wolinsky addresses many issues, such as the traps of techniques, gurus, belief systems, and yes/no teachings and Nargajuna's Eight Negations, & subtle nuances of esoterica.  The DVD owner has this opportunity to support a truly independent film maker.  Ultimately, even Deconstruction is to be discarded.  And there is NO VOID.  We are to focus on and absorb the message, not the messenger.  Maharaj was a unique and opposite personality of R.Maharshi having unpredictable moods. I think of him as the fierce tiger of Advaita.  His outbursts could shock or bring joy, he could be angry or blissful to his own reactions to the  questioners. He lived in pain, was a chain smoker, owned tobacco shops and almost became a wanderer but responded to the pleas to remain and teach which he did.  So there, a great Master who lived in our own times.",1187481600,13,1373,4.751054852320675
