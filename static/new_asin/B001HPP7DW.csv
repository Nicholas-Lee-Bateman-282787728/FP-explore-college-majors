8309282,3,B001HPP7DW,"Eagle Pennell was a young independent film maker in the late '70s in Austin Texas.  He died young, but left some great promise behind  This is a nicely done package of his films and accompanying music.  The films aren't great, but they're fun to watch, and you can imagine what Eagle could have done with a little money and professional support.  Lou Perryman and Sonny Carl Davis just can't help themselves, and you can't help smiling as they bring these Texas goofballs to life.",1344902400,,480,4.678571428571429
8309283,4,B001HPP7DW,"The Whole Shootin' Match by filmmaker Eagle Pennell is a movie that is both lighthearted and insightful at the same time. Being a movie filmed in Texas and about Texans, I was interested to see how the characters would be portrayed. The characters Frank and Lloyd are not the stereotypical ""cowboy"" prevalent in most films about Texas. They are just ""good ol' boys."" I really enjoyed the humor in this film because it was like the characters were just joking around. Because the film had a lot of improvised lines, it was very lighthearted and fun. However, there were parts of the film that were heartbreaking. The way that Frank treated his wife was very sad. He was not a good husband to her and watching him cheat on her was difficult. However, I do like that this film seemed authentic. People's lives are not perfect, so seeing a film that had the main characters be lovably funny as well as inconsiderate of others was good. I really liked the character of Frank because he was so funny. When he and Lloyd got together, they really made me laugh. Even when they were just doing things like working for a woman trying to fix her windows, the way that they interacted with one another was really funny. I also liked Frank's wife. She seemed to be the glue that held the film together. Without her, we may not have seen the other side of Frank. She brought a seriousness to the film that made it worth watching. By the end of the film, I was unsure how it would turn out for the characters. I love that it ended somewhat simply. After a failed attempt at finding treasure and at suicide, Frank joins Lloyd on their trek back to their normal lives.",1305072000,,1651,4.470198675496689
8309284,4,B001HPP7DW,"The Whole Shootin' Match is a phenomenal indie regional film. The film is clearly done with a very limited budget but this is what makes the film. The film is centered on the lives of two men, Lloyd and Frank. The charisma and chemistry the characters share translates poignantly in film. Pennell does well to illustrate the every day life and the every day man in this film; the relationship between characters is so intimate and real. Perhaps the most touching element in the film is the chance of great career potential as Lloyd invented a mop, but sadly, the men sign their own death sentence and lose millions. The way in which the two characters deal with this situation resonates well with the audience in that people must persevere and will. Pennell captures a small Texas town perfectly and the characters are so believable and relatable (to Texans). The acting, directing, cinematography and script are superb. This film is quite an experience for viewers. This is regional film at its best--it is, in essence, the pioneer of regional film. Capturing a small Texas town and the people therein, grants the film great credibility. For viewers outside of Texas they could view this film and, without question, get a real taste and sense of what remote Texas towns are like. Troubled relationships and troubled lives are illustrated in this film through great illustration via script, acting and directing. The friendship among the full cast is evident and really makes the film. For just over an hour and thirty minutes, this film really is a must-see. For film lovers out there, this film will ignite a love for regional and indie film. It's too bad that Pennell isn't here anymore to make more films like this. After viewing this film, I recommend viewing all of Pennell's films. A great film and a great film to study again and again!",1304899200,,1844,4.80188679245283
8309285,5,B001HPP7DW,"Eagle Pennel's The Whole Shootin' Match was the second movie the Austin-based filmmaker made. He submitted it to the U.S.-Utah film festival and Robert Redford happened to see it while he was there. The movie inspired him to start the Sundance Film Institute, leading eventually to the current Independent Cinema scene. The movie is about two pals, Frank and Lloyd, who are living in poverty yet keep their chins up against the odds. Their constant frustrations however wear them down, the inability to strike it rich no matter what they try, remedied only by a night on the town. Frank is the more dynamic of the two, a man with a bit of an ego and an insatiable desire to live beyond his means. He is incompetent in almost every meaning of the word and when the two finally lose out on a truly huge money making deal (Lou invents what is the 70s equivalent of a Swiffer, but signs away the rights by accident for just 1000 dollars), he is the one who tries to kill himself. The movie is extremely well written and is an excellent example of regional cinema. I would recommend this to just about anyone.",1303948800,,1104,4.525
8309286,5,B001HPP7DW,"Made in 1978 on a very limited budget, raised by the filmmakers themselves, Eagle Pennell's Texan buddy comedy was instrumental in demonstrating what could be done outside the Hollywood studio system by a director of vision and talent, inspiring Robert Redford to set up the Sundance Institute to support and encourage other filmmakers with a more intimate, personal vision more closely related to how real people live, the film thus leading the way towards the modern US independent movie scene. Almost forgotten and up until now virtually impossible to see, Watchmaker's laudable efforts to restore the film, releasing it in a lavish 3-disc DVD package with numerous supporting features and commentaries, show however that the film is more than of just historical interest, and that despite the limitations of the production, the weaknesses in the non-professional acting and the rough-and-ready direction, there's a heart-warming honesty to its depiction of the people of the American South that a more polished film could never match.

Appropriately in a way then, the film is about two Texan men, Frank and Loyd, small-timers operating off the beaten track, working with imperfect equipment, knowing they can't compete with big business and unwilling to work within its rules. Their small-time business ventures inevitably founder, and they as often find themselves out of work and out of pocket, but they have an unshakable belief in their abilities and a determination to succeed, and are convinced that one day the invention of the right product or service is going to make them rich men. In the meantime, failures are shrugged off with a night-out on the town enjoying the music, companionship and the women that the local bars have to offer. The men's carefree outlook however isn't shared by Frank's wife Paulette or their son, who are increasingly finding Frank's lack of responsibility difficult to endure, but will the two men wake up to reality before it's too late, or will they continue to cling to their dreams?

In a way then, the situation of characters with talent and ability to succeed but with the capability of throwing it all away reflects the reality known by the director, and mirror the sad decline that would follow in his own personal life. It's this truthful honesty about the character flaws in these Texan men that make The Whole Shootin' Match compelling, entertaining and heartbreaking viewing, drawn directly from reality rather than trying to soften the approach to appeal to a wider mainstream audience. The characters may be flawed certainly, and act against their own best interests out of stupidity or pride, but what shines through it all and redeems their faults is the strength of the friendship between Frank and Loyd that is mutually supportive, completely trusting, enduring and ultimately touching. It's one of the greatest friendships ever depicted on the screen. The truth and sincerity of that vision - assisted in no small part from a gorgeous country-inflected guitar score by the director's brother Chuck Pennell - shines through and helps the film overcome the limitations of the budget and sometimes primitive shooting and acting techniques.

This is what independent cinema is all about and The Whole Shootin' Match consequently comes across as a kind of missing link between early Cassavetes and the more modern US indie of Kelly Reichardt (Old Joy), informing the slacker ethos of fellow Texans Richard Linklater (Slacker) or the Kentucker Audley (Team Picture), with a genuine feel for characters living outside the mainstream, trying to find their place in the world. More than a historical curiosity then, the personal commitment and uncompromising stance of all those involved in making The Whole Shootin' Match ensures that the qualities that made it inspirational to a whole new generation of filmmakers are still evident and still very much relevant. The outstanding presentation of the restored 16mm film elements is supported with a full set of extra features that include Pennell's first short film, a feature length documentary on the director, a CD of the soundtrack, and additional interviews, articles and commentaries.",1266019200,4,4193,5.208888888888889
8309287,5,B001HPP7DW,"Kudos to Watchmaker Films for their better-than-Criterion-quality restoration.  They have treated this little picture with the reverence usually reserved for lost classics and, indeed, after watching it again after 30 years, I have to agree that it is a lost classic.

The packaging is great, the doc is great, all the extras are great, everything about the product is great.  Can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.  Thanks for giving ""Shootin' Match"" the place in history that it deserves.

""The Whole Shootin' Match"" is an affectionate and funny look at two hapless blue collar losers who refuse to give up on their dreams of striking it rich. Pennell and cast worked for free and shot on weekends using short ends b&w film stock and borrowed equipment. The film was a sensation on the festival circuit, and by all accounts was the inspiration for Robert Redford to found The Sundance Institute.",1241654400,3,896,4.9072847682119205
8309288,5,B001HPP7DW,"Directed by the late Eagle Pennell, THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH is more than a independent film landmark. It's a great, low-key character study featuring wonderfully naturalistic acting from Lou Perryman (best known as LG in THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and who was recently murdered in Austin, Texas) and Sonny Carl Davis (the irate customer who gets Judge Reinhold fired from his burger bitch job in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH) as a pair of working class stiffs in Texas with big dreams and empty pockets. Pennell would go on to direct one more notable film, LAST NIGHT AT THE ALAMO, and a few forgettable films before passing away in 2002. THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH is a minor masterwork to be sought out and treasured.",1240704000,4,719,4.806451612903226
