2762522,4,B000NA1WH2,"I think pretty much all the previous reviewers, as well as myself, agree that both these movies are great war flicks. I saw them both when they were originally released in the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed them. For whatever reason I had never gotten around to buying the movies when they were released on DVD. So when my daughter gave this ""Double-Feature"" set to me for Christmas I was thrilled.

These are basic DVDs of the films. There are very little ""special features"" included. Both films have the trailers and the Dirty Dozen has a short featurette on the film. That's pretty much it. But since I'm not a big fan of film commentaries that is fine with me. Most of the time I find the commentaries to be the ramblings of people too darn old to quite remember what they were thinking while they were filming anyway. Just check out the commentaries for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Seven-Special-Edition/dp/B000059TFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)</a>. Eli Wallach, James Colburn, and two production managers talking over the top of each other. Drove me nuts!

The big advantage here is that you get both movies, on opposite sides of the same disk, for a great price. Both are uncut so you don't get the ""Edited for television and formatted to fit your screen"" versions. If you are like me and buy DVDs mostly to watch the movies, and the special features aren't that important to you, then don't hesitate. It will cost you more when purchased separately.",1231113600,8,1560,5.211155378486056

2762524,2,B000NA1WH2,"These are both EXCELLENT movies. However, for some reason (mere incompetence, I'd bet) the dvd's packaging states that The Dirty Dozen is presented in 16x9 (anamorphic) format and also includes audio commentary by cast and crew. This is NOT TRUE--neither of these features exist on the disc. If you're thinking of buying this as an upgrade from your standard single-disc version of Dirty Dozen, don't bother. The DD side of this flipper disc is the same as the budget single-disc, non-anamorphic version that's been available for years.
Warner's should either fix the packaging, or upgrade the content of the disc. SO ANNOYING!",1201737600,13,627,5.1568627450980395

2762527,4,B000NA1WH2,The double feature is a good value and plenty of action for any excitement addict.  These are two movies with a twist and tongue in cheek.  That is until the shooting begins.  The action comes fast and furious against the dreaded Germans.  One is a treasure hunt and the other a suicide mission.  You have to be a little patriotic to care what happens to these misfits.  But the plots are agreeable and the acting passable.  It takes a leap of faith to think these things could really happen.  But once you suspend disbelief you can sit back and enjoy yourself.  From the grit to the graft you get every possible angle in this double feature.  If you are a war buff this is a good addition to your collection.,1189814400,4,709,4.384615384615385
2762528,2,B000NA1WH2,"Both of these movies are great, fun and classics. I have no problem with either. They still hold up as good movies. I agree with the other reviewer who made comments about the packaging and the 'double feature' sales gimmick. It is a good idea. Two great old movies back to back for a modest price. When I saw the Turner Classic opening for Dirty Dozen I thought, ""what did they do? Just copy this off of TV?""

The movies rock? The double feature concept is cool. Just wish they would have put a little more into it and gave us something extra like a 'making of' or maybe some new interviews.",1188172800,2,592,4.285714285714286
2762529,5,B000NA1WH2,"2 of my favorite ""war ain't so bad flick's"". If you want realism look else where. If you just want good adventure this is it. A full evenings entertainment on 1 disc.",1187913600,,166,4.21875
2762530,1,B000NA1WH2,"I already own both films but purchased this as the case described ""Dirty Dozen"" as being a 16x9 transfer. It is not. Further, special features are listed for this film that are not actually on the disc. I knew I was in trouble when the film began with the Turner logo. Old transfer. ""Kelly's Heroes"" IS 16x9 as it was on the single feature release.

In addition, it appears the newly repackaged ""How the West Was Won"" suffers from the same deceptive packaging by being labeled ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" when it is not and is also an old Turner master.

People are bound to complain so it's hard to believe Warner Home Video, previously very reliable, would do this intentionally. Something is defintely wrong in their QC department these days.",1180915200,51,747,4.694656488549619

I was delighted to find it on DVD. Dirty Dozen is a CLASSIC and features the authentic WWII veteran and hero Lee Marvin. BOTH movies have Donald Sutherland, of whom I have been a fan since before Keifer (who is wonderful in his own right) was not even a glimmer in Mr Sutherland the elder's eye.",1412812800,,470,4.175824175824176

2762634,5,B000NA1WH2,"WHERE EAGLES DARE and THE DIRTY DOZEN have come and gone many years ago, but their legacy lives on. These are classic films. These are ground breaking films. These are endearing films. The sounds of screeching steel along dirt roads and snow covered terrain and the distant sound of the daring heroics smashing their way to freedom, victory and more have long been silent, but the legends of these extraordinary and endearing films lingers on in our memory and give us hope that evil shall always be vanquished with a bit of tongue in cheek along the way. They just don't make them like this any more. The scripting, the rousing and memorable moving scores, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche and the best part of our youth.
I often have fleeting thoughts of these films, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from these WWII legends. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war.",1381795200,,1255,4.95260663507109

Kelly's Heroes is the ultimate ""oddball"" movie about an unlikely bunch of Soldiers going the extra mile to complete their mission... in this case it happens to be the liberation of several million dollars worth of Nazi gold!

The Dirty Dozen is about another group of unlikely Soldiers... in this case criminals who are given a choice between a mission which is almost certain to kill them or their sentences. Led by an Army major who is not exactly favored by the general staff these men (for the most part) prove themselves to be heroes in their own right.
