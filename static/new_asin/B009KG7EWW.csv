5344272,5,B009KG7EWW,This is working perfectly for our small group Bible Study.  I recommend it to everyone.  It's really great!  Thank you.,1373068800,2,119,4.85

5344276,5,B009KG7EWW,"This is a great study for anyone who wants to purge idols from your life. Many young adults in the church have no working knowledge about this subject and we have been able to discuss introduce this concept and get them thinking about what a walk with Jesus is really about. This is the second study that our single adult group has gone thru by Kyle Idleman. The first was the ""Not a Fan"" study and we purchased wristbands and t-shirts for it. He has an insight that relates to the college age adults and that helps us bring it to our study group. My wife and I are just over 50 but we like rockin' music and travel around the world for business.",1425859200,,646,4.217741935483871
5344277,5,B009KG7EWW,All of the Kyle Idleman series by City On A Hill Productions are very well done and relevant.  I use this for my grandchildren and my study class at church.  I have had an excellent response for the members.,1424908800,,207,4.282051282051282
5344278,5,B009KG7EWW,Great study,1418601600,,11,5.0
5344279,4,B009KG7EWW,This is a good small group study. It's a little intense because people are expected to share their personal struggles with idols.,1416614400,,129,4.909090909090909
5344280,5,B009KG7EWW,Very insightful....I am looking forward to sharing this with our Men's Fellowship Breakfast.,1415836800,,92,6.153846153846154
5344281,5,B009KG7EWW,Excellent small group study. The videos add to what is read in the book. Kyle does however repeat a lot of what is said in the book in the movies. The stories from the individuals directly from their mouths are amazing. Glad I chose this book and small group study to lead a bible study.,1414195200,,287,4.236363636363636
5344282,5,B009KG7EWW,Great series. God is good,1414022400,,25,4.2
5344283,5,B009KG7EWW,Powerful and transforming.,1413590400,,26,8.0
5344284,3,B009KG7EWW,"Love, love, love the book. The study is okay and did not match up well to the chapters of the book. I think we could have done a better job just following the book.",1413244800,,164,3.8529411764705883
5344285,5,B009KG7EWW,Only on the second video and it's a really amazing study and amazingly easy to lead. I definitely will try another City on a Hill study next session.,1411689600,,149,4.357142857142857

5344288,3,B009KG7EWW,"I bought the series for my Sunday School class study.  The message of the series is the right message....that we focus our time and resources and devotion to ""gods"" in many forms, rather than making The God the only God in our lives.  The class got to feeling pretty beat up with the message that if we do not commit fully to God, that we are less than we should be.  From the Bible, we know that is true...just that this series seemed to deliver that message in a ""do it or else"" attitude.  Maybe we were just too sensitive.",1407974400,9,525,4.22
5344289,5,B009KG7EWW,This is a book that everyone should read.  A potential life changer.,1404086400,,68,4.666666666666667
5344290,4,B009KG7EWW,"I used this as a small group study at my church.  It seemed to be more fitting for a men's study in that the characters were mostly dealing with men issues (pornography, getting ahead in business, etc.).  All in all, it was a good study and worked well.",1400112000,4,253,4.25
5344291,5,B009KG7EWW,Want to be challenged and to grow in the Spirit of the Lord.  This is an excellent series developed by Kyle Idleman.  I did this with my men's bible study and each of the gentlemen were challenged.  The study was so amazing that each of these gentlemen went back to their respective home churches and started the study in classes there.  Would highly recommend this study to anyone wishing to grow in their spiritual maturity.,1400112000,,426,4.64
5344292,5,B009KG7EWW,"Kyle does a great job of getting us to think about where the idols are in our lives, he needs to add one more lesson on the study though .... to include hobbies and sports!",1399075200,,172,3.942857142857143
5344293,5,B009KG7EWW,"I had the privilege of editing the leader's guide and ""combat journal"" for ""gods at war,"" a new DVD-based study from City On A Hill Productions, narrated by Kyle Idleman. The small group material was written by Ross Brodfuehrer, who did an incredible job developing this curriculum.

From the City on a Hill website: ""In a new twist to the cinematic style City on a Hill has become known for, this 6 episode series was filmed in a docudrama style  ... featuring the late Chuck Colson (Prison Fellowship), Chuck Bentley (Crown Financial Ministries) and others telling their true stories. In these compelling stories, we will see some reflection of ourselves, and recognize the true battle that lies at the heart of all our sin struggles. These stories also point the way to victory, as we see the kind of life-transforming power that Christ is ready to pour out in our lives as well.""

I believe God will use this study to change lives, if group members fully engage with the material, which is easy to do with these dramatic videos and well-written discussion guides. If your group used and grew through ""Not a Fan,"" you'll love this study as well. I'm highly recommending it!",1392681600,4,1176,4.754901960784314
5344294,5,B009KG7EWW,This video series uses everyday people to make the points. Kyle is only a small part of the videos. They are put together well. I wish each video was longer. I wish there was more reference to Scripture and not just what life was like before Jesus but more on how Jesus helps to get past momentary hurdles. But over all I was very impressed with the series.,1389139200,6,357,4.264705882352941
5344295,5,B009KG7EWW,This is a Great study that helps learn how to adjust our priorities that Kyle helps us walk threw together.,1387152000,3,107,4.4
5344296,5,B009KG7EWW,The DVD lessons are very well done.  I believe this is a must read for every believer.  The book is an easy read that packs a punch.  I have taken steps in my life as a result of this program.,1386633600,3,192,3.75
5344297,5,B009KG7EWW,"Gods at War is a deep, reflective study on discovering your true priorities. I highly recommend this study for personal or small group development.",1384041600,,147,5.166666666666667
5344298,5,B009KG7EWW,"We used in small groups, and even with teens in youth group, great teaching for todays issues. Would buy any videos with kyle idleman. Also appreciated seller, good price, fast shipping and in good shape. Thx",1379980800,,208,4.805555555555555
5344299,5,B009KG7EWW,"This small group study is very easy to use, featuring a 30 minute video for each meeting.  The content is challenging and very relevant.  We decided to combine kids, teens and adults of various ages, and everyone regardless of age is finding valuable help in the study.",1378512000,,269,4.702127659574468
5344300,5,B009KG7EWW,I bought the book and i loved it. It tells you all the things you need to do to keep your mind on the lord.,1377216000,,107,3.32
5344301,5,B009KG7EWW,Used this study in my young marrieds Sunday school class. The response was terrific and made a lasting impression. Kyle's presentation is an excellent springboard to meaningful discussion and application.,1376784000,,204,5.833333333333333
5344302,5,B009KG7EWW,This book has proven itself very helpful in my teaching and ministry.  It is very thought provoking and practical.  RECOMMEND!,1373587200,2,126,5.25
8542451,5,B009KG7EWW,Great series,1475712000,,12,5.5
8542452,5,B009KG7EWW,Great series! Our small group loves Kyle's approach. He is very easy to understand and learn from and his videos are engaging.,1468886400,,126,4.7727272727272725
8542453,3,B009KG7EWW,"I was really disappointed in this Small Group study. I absolutely LOVED the book, but this study just did not seem the same as the book. Some of these sessions made many people feel awkward, I am glad this was used in a small group study and not in a Sunday School class. It is definitely not for everyone as it focused WAY too much on sexual sins. People in my group got really sick of hearing it over and over again. I was really disappointed. Again I loved the book.

You will have better luck just using the book.",1467676800,4,517,4.17
8542454,5,B009KG7EWW,"This is a life changing book. I recommend it to all who desire to turn from ""idols"" to a true love of God.",1465689600,,106,3.652173913043478
8542455,5,B009KG7EWW,Great book.  Kyle does a great job showing us how gifts from God's can be made into idols.  This book makes you take a deep look into the things you put before God.,1459036800,,164,3.9393939393939394
8542456,5,B009KG7EWW,"Great Bible study that touches upon unpleasant topics, but it needed to be done. I have done several Kyle Idleman's Bible Studies and it is near impossible to not be challenged, enlightened, convicted in some way, etc... We say we believe in God or that we follow Jesus but then Kyle poses seven diagnostic questions that determine who or what our God or gods really are. This study incorporates real life testimonies that everyone can relate to. If you are a believer of Christ and want to grow in the Word and build a stronger relationship with God, this is the study for you.",1456358400,,578,4.5673076923076925
8542457,5,B009KG7EWW,See previous.  Great study.,1453161600,,27,5.75
8542458,5,B009KG7EWW,"This was an excellent addition to our small group. We went through this study and everyone got a LOT out of it. It is very challenging and makes you examine what in your life you are placing above God. The videos are extraordinarily well done...not cheesy like other clips but well-produced, poignant, and challenging. We all saw something in the videos that reminded us of ourselves that we needed to work on. Give this study a try...you won't regret it.",1451260800,,455,4.7
8542459,5,B009KG7EWW,Awesome study. It deals with the idols in our lives and how God being all faithful never leaves us and can rescue us from these things.,1449619200,,135,4.230769230769231
8542460,5,B009KG7EWW,participants report life-changing results,1448064000,,41,9.5
