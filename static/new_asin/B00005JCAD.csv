8646557,5,B00005JCAD,I love this video!  It's straight up strength training without the dancing that you usually get in workout videos.  This is a great video for beginners becuase he moves at a pace that is easy to follow but you still feel that burn you are craving.,1144108800,,247,4.3478260869565215
8646558,1,B00005JCAD,"I just purchaed this video and it is a huge disappointment and a waste of money.  It's not worth the $14.99, your better off setting aside some time and doing some crunches, push-ups and lunges on your own.  It's not even close to a military type workout.  A better bootcamp work out is the Crunch BootCamp Workout, at least this one challenges you and is more like boot camp.",1107216000,3,376,4.420289855072464
8646559,1,B00005JCAD,Do not buy this video or book.  I was really disappointed in the contents.  Anyone with a physical fitness background could have done better than this.  My three year old could put together a better excercise program than this.  Don't waste your money.  High school PE never looked so good.,1092096000,4,290,4.72
8646560,4,B00005JCAD,"i have been working with weights for 4 years.  trying diversity i was told will increase your muscle tone.  this is true. when i did the bootcamp videos this week, i felt muscles worked at a different angle was much more intense.  it was good to feel the musles work.  it was an excellent team of three that complimented eachother.  they are fun and i loved the little comments througout the video (lois lanes and supermans).  it was a workout at a great pace for beginners and advanced people.  the pace was perfect. thanks again",1078272000,2,530,4.515789473684211
8646561,1,B00005JCAD,"Another waste of money, why did i open both boot camp video, now i can't return them. Again poor quality, really bland, useless high school PE exercises. If you want good quality Video for excercise and fitness just got the personal training sites. This is just garbage. Someone at amazon should review all this Military Type excerise videos for content.
I wouldn't even waste time on a free copy of anything with Navy Seal or Booth Camp. Just a Marketing Tag to get you to buy useless Junk.",1064966400,8,491,4.590909090909091
8646562,1,B00005JCAD,"This Video is a waste. a real rip off. Don't buy it, I don't recommend it to anyone. poor quality, useless information. they are basically doing exercise from high school PE class.",1064966400,5,180,4.65625
