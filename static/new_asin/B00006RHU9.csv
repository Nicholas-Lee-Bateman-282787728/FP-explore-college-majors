Love the accents.",1478390400,,115,5.444444444444445
7972831,4,B00006RHU9,"I loved this series when I watched it years ago and loved it just as much second time around. Quality of DVD is terrific and speed of delivery was great. Jimmy Nail, Bill Nighy, Kevin Whateley and all the lads were a great combination in this show and most have gone onto great acting careers. Love the humour and accents.",1314057600,4,322,4.383333333333334
