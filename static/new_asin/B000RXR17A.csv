8202871,5,B000RXR17A,"This is the genuine article - the first Ali-Frazier fight, March 7th, 1971.  Called ""The Fight of the Century"", it pitted for the first time in boxing history, two undefeated heavyweight champions slugging it out for the undisputed title.  In my opinion, this was by far the best of the trilogy of fights these two champions had.  The pace was torrid, the punches were wicked, and the fighting intense.

The introduction section lays the background for the fight and the controversy which explains why this fight was truly the ""Fight of the Century"".

This is a MUST for any serious fight fan - perhaps the greatest fight in the heavyweight division.

8202872,5,B000RXR17A,"For the first 1 minute and 10 seconds of this section, this piece does have a credits opening much like a movie (director, music composer, editor, etc). The credits are small and in behind the Credits there is footage of Ali walking behind a Young Don King, boasting about how he just signed the contract and how he's going to handle Joe Frazier.... Then you see clips of Muhammed and Joe getting aggressive at a press conference.... Then footage goes into people of all walks of life talking about the fight of the century, each of the fighters, and one person calling Ali a draft dodger and saying how ""Unamerican"" Ali is, and it being a disgrace that people would pay to see him fight. Then you see a great Muhammed Ali speech, first talking about how people want to see him beat because of Religion, Race, and the Draft - then all the sudden he cracks a joke and the whole audience is lasting. This is just the Opening Titles section.
