7911339,2,B00000IQ4M,ok so the movie wasn't all that bad plot wise (as far as hentai goes) but the animation was the most deplorable thing i have ever seen the people who were supposed to be normal looked more freakish than the demons half the  time so if you don't have a problem with junky animation than by all means  take a look but isn't animation really the whole point of anime in the first  place?,953251200,,384,4.162162162162162
7911340,4,B00000IQ4M,I want to say that this movie is great for those fans that love hardcare deep action.  Even with the sex I must agree with the earlier custmer reviews by saying that the story line is superb.  However I do have too warn that like earlier reviews have said this movie does not have the final  ending of the 5 series videos.  The movie only covers in 110 minutes the  first four videos of the 5 video series.  So if the reader of this gets the  movie be warned it does not have the final ending of the saga.  I beleive  video five of the five part series is the ending although I won't guarantee  it because I haven't received it yet but I'll review that when I do get it  and watch it.,945907200,,684,4.029850746268656
7911341,4,B00000IQ4M,"A hodgepodge of demons,sex,violence,and camp. The art and animation varies,and is generally better near the end. Similar plotwise to Overfiend,except the sex scenes are alot more graphic. The amount of sex  scenes is a bit light for it's 110 minute duration,but there's an extra 11  minutes at the end of just sex scenes from the OAV's that they didn't put  in the movie (IMHO these are better than the ones they left in the  movie).This little bonus is above and beyond the call of duty. Also there's  a 5 minute history lesson of anime at the beginning of the tape,and a 5  minute preview at the end of other Anime 18 releases. They really gave this  package the works.",944092800,9,671,4.588235294117647
