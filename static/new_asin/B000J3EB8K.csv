2666722,5,B000J3EB8K,"I just found out about this set last night and I am just absolutely stunned.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think Match Game would make it to DVD.  From what I've read at GSN's ""Classics"" forum, this set is supposed to consist of 30 of the best episodes from 1973 to 1982, and likely will be uncut, meaning that the ticket and fee plugs should also be left in tact!  It sure will be great to watch these episodes without those annoying speed-ups and credit crunches that we always see on GSN.  Though I'm aware of the Jeopardy DVD which only contains a handful of episodes, one only being a vintage episode (the pilot), I'm hoping that the Match Game set will open the doors and pave the way for many other classic game shows on DVD.

This will definitely be a must-have for any hardcore Match Game, or game shows in general, fan.",1162684800,35,833,4.314102564102564

2666725,5,B000J3EB8K,This should be a fun and enjoyable set.  There were a lot of funny and witty moments from this show.  Hope it sells well and that there might be other sets released as well.,1161043200,8,173,4.0588235294117645
2666726,4,B000J3EB8K,"the inevitable question is, just who's to say that this random sampling is indeed the ""best"" of Match Game? the initiated will inevitably remember at least one bit of inspired mischief they'll be sorry to see not included. basically, it's like a musical artist's greatest-hits package: there is inevitably more emphasis on the tangible ""hits"" part than on the more ethereal ""greatest.""
much is made, for instance, of the fact that Kirstie Allie's television debut was as a Match Game contestant. an interesting piece of history, certainly, but how much, really, does it have to do with how the game goes that particular week? (do we really need all three of her episodes?) personally, i found it pretty cool at first as i recalled that Allie was in Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan, but ceased to be particularly impressed upon remembering that she also somehow ended up on the very worst (not to mention most overrated) sitcom of the coming decade, Cheers.
so basically, the inevitable room for debate concerning what constitutes ""best"" will cast it's own shadow on the selection presented. but that being said, there's good laughs awaiting you here. i personally don't really think of Match Game as a game-show so much as an off-the-cuff comic free-for-all a' la Whose Line Is It Anyway?, and there's certainly no shortage of that element herein.
one particularly pleasant surprise is that significant (of not quite equal) time is given to the last couple of years. you hear so much about Richard Dawson's contribution that i was frankly half afraid the post-Dawson era would get the cold shoulder. don't get me wrong. i'm not trying to downplay Dawson's appeal and or contribution. it's just that when ya get right down to it, ""Dickie"" Dawson is to Match Game what Davy Jones was to The Monkees: no one's denying that he was a significant contributor, but he was hardly (as some would have you think) the whole damn show.
the most famous incident featured is probably the infamous ""Dumb Dora's cultured pearls"" incident. the contestant's answer was school, and when the show is running smoothly any sort of school would be considered close enough to match. but in this case the judges get all high-hat and reject such usually admissible embellishments as Finishing School and Scuba Diving School.
my favorite bit here is probably when the ""lower tier"" decides to clone the upper. Richard Dawson adopts the flibbertigibbet urbanity of Brett Somers, and Fannie Flagg the campy arrogance of Charles Nelson Reilly.
the special features are a similarly mixed bag. the interviews with Brett Somers are a fun look behind the scenes, but I was a little saddened to note how much emphasis is placed on the featured episodes. that sounds logical, but the result is that all the featured clips are things you've just seen rather than the honorable mention at least some could've been for the episodes that didn't quite make the cut.
well, the heartfelt tribute to the memory of host Gene Rayburn at least partly makes up for that.
also interesting is the original black-&-white pilot produced in 1962. about the only thing the two approaches have in common is host Gene Rayburn. this original prosaic version of the game wasn't exactly the 11:00 news, but it's still played less broadly and so seems positively somber by comparison.
so you won't regret the purchase, even if you do regret that quite a few highlights fell short of the standards of whoever was in charge of the compilation. there's room and then some for The Best Of Match Game Vol. 2, and i'm pretty sure there's demand as well.
meantime, thank God the reruns are still running GSN.",1397088000,3,3640,4.853697749196141

2666737,5,B000J3EB8K,"I purchased this set when if first came out and have recently watched it again. This set still delivers great laughs and fun but it leaves you wanting more. Sadly, the company (BCI) went out of business and the proposed second volume never happened.

Additionally, Match Game seems to be on the decline on GSN. They are currently only airing a handful of episodes from 1974-75. In the next year or so I expect Match Game to vanish from GSN completley. Before that happens, I hope someone picks up the show for future DVD releases. I'd really love to see a best of volume for 73-74, 75-76, 77-78, 79 and PM. I think 25-30 episodes per set (4 more sets total) would really be great. If sales dictated it, then one final volume of 25-30 episodes from the syndicated 79-82 run could be done. That would be well over 100 of the best of the best episodes. If GSN takes the show off the aire, then I seriously doubt that we will ever see it again.

Overall, the DVD set is great. The picture quality is better than what has aired on GSN. Not to mention the episodes are uncut.

My only real complaint is that the set doesn't include more episodes from the best years (73-77). If another company picks up the DVD releases that could be corrected.

All in all a great release. I'm still wanting more.",1304899200,3,1291,4.389121338912134

2666739,5,B000J3EB8K,"I grew up watching these originally, so lots of nostalgia.  Also, I was concerned in how the show was presented.  But, except for a few rough edges (like the the Brett interviews and associated clips being a little jarring in the way they were edited together) this presentation from BCI is first rate.  The episodes those chose to represent the show had to be among the best.  I've watched a few from the similar Price is Right set and those aren't nearly as good, or addicting as the ones here.  It's hard to stop watching...and I'm sure I'll turn around when I'm done and watch the whole thing from the beginning since there is no Volume 2.  :(  I also REALLY wanted a Lets Make a Deal set like this one.  Tic Tak Dough, Joker's Wild, Card Sharks and Gong Show (to name a few) would also be welcome.

2666742,4,B000J3EB8K,"I just received my copy of the 4-Disc DVD set of ""The Best of Match Game"" a few days ago and have been having fun with it every since.  I jumped between all 4 discs, watching certain episodes, just to see what is on this set.  Yes, there is a slight defect on disc 1 where it tends to skip 2 scenes over, rather than to the next scene after the original commercial breaks.  Don't know why it is doing that, but other than that, all the other discs seem fine.  Also, the main menu could have been more readable, so to better understand where you want to go next while viewing different episodes.

Even if you are not into game shows, this DVD set is a must for any fan of crazy, late 70's/early 80's television comedies because Match Game always featured some of the best celebrities that were big in this genre at the time the show was in production---Vickie Lawrence, Arte Johnson, Betty White, Fannie Flagg and Jack Klugman to name a few, plus the incredible comedic talents of the show's regulars, Brett Sommers (Jack's wife), Richard Dawson, Charles Nelson Riley and of course, the show's host, Gene Rayburn.  With the exception of Betty White and Richard Dawson, most of the other key Match Game celebs including its host, have passsed on.

It is such a pleasure to see these vintage episodes again (now on DVD) after so many years, even though they have been around for many years on GSN (Game Show Network).  The famous Match Game set, complete with orange shag carpet and plastered/glittery wall designs seems like a blast from the 70's past all over again and that memorable, funky, disco-fied theme music will most definitely get you humming to the Match Game beat all over again.  But somehow the show still looks somewhat fresh, even by today's high-tech television standards.  For anyone who is into television trivia, the 70's/80's version of Match Game was taped at the famous Stage 33 (now the Bob Barker Studio) at CBS Television City in Hollywood, which was also home to The Carol Burnett Show and The Price Is Right (still to this day) at the same time Match Game was in production, sharing the same CBS stage with 2 other CBS classics.",1267747200,3,2155,4.574025974025974

2666744,5,B000J3EB8K,"""Match Game"" stands as one of the simultaneously cleverest and simplest game shows of all time, and this four DVD set is a treasure. Hosted by the great Gene Rayburn, the show went through some changes over the years, but always retained its sense of fun and good humor.

This set contains hand-picked episodes that are among the best aired, and features some of the greatest and funniest moments in the history of the show. The six celebrity panelists changed weekly, although regulars Richard Dawson, Charles Nelson Reilly, and Brett Somers appear far more than other rotating panelists. It was fun to watch the changes over the years, and was especially fun to watch the ever-escalating antics of Brett and Charles. It was truly amusing to see the great consolation prizes (including many variations on the theme of car waxing, and some truly ghastly food products and gaudy kitchen countertop laminate to serve the food upon) and hear the ever present voice of announcer Johnny Olson again.

The DVD has numerous episodes on every disc, and each disc has a special interview segment with Brett Somers. The interviews are interesting and informative and Brett comes through with the same sense of humor that made her so loveable on the show. Also included are ""A Tribute to Gene Rayburn"", which is informative and made me respect and appreciate him even more than I previously had, the Original 1962 pilot of ""The Match Game"", which is not only in black and white, but is a completely different (and much more sedate) format than the show we remember from the 1970's, as well as a still gallery of photos.

My only complaint is that there haven't been more sets released of this timeless comic game show. I hope to see more of this historical and hilarious gem in the future.",1265760000,4,1778,4.785016286644951

2666749,4,B000J3EB8K,"Great for nostalgia. Leaves you wanting more.

Watch the shows on each disc before you watch the interviews/flash backs with Brett Sommers. The show clips are pulled from the shows on the discs, rather than from single clip on the disc, and it gets pretty choppy and disjointed while your DVD player hunts around for the clips. This might have been a good idea to save space on the discs but it makes the interviews tedious. Rather than 30 second blips of a real highlight you get 4 minutes of show you've already watched.

My only complaint is that there should have been more variety in the episodes (as in not two episodes of the same panelists, and also more CBS daytime episodes from 1974 thru 1976.)  I also wish that they had the last ""Match Game PM"" ep, as well as the first one, and that they showed the first daytime syndicated ep in 1979, along with the ad that started it.

1.  Bad Disc 4!!  I am in the process of returning my first set for this reason.

2.  Episodes should have been chronological and not all mixed up.  You could really tell when the game started to pick up steam, but then you get thrown back to the 73-75 era which was just so-so.

3.  They could have picked better episodes, in my opinion.  Some of the episodes could NOT have been the ""best"" of the Match Game.  I remember screaming out loud in laughter at some of the episodes and they are not on this set.

I was determined to get a working set but after 3 tries I gave up.  I purchased my copies in late December of '06.  I'll wait until the problem is corrected and buy a fourth copy.

As mentioned in several Amazon reviews, true fans of Matchgame favor the 1973-1977 years over any others.  This is the only real problem with the content.  Unfortunatley, half the episodes from this set are from 1978-1982 when the show had lost a little of the spontenaiety and humor along with several top notch celebrity guests (Maclean Stevenson is no Richard Dawson).  They should have given fans a broader selection of celebrity guests instead of showing too much of the same guest panel.  Furthermore, I would have rather seen a 70's episode than the 1962 pilot which added little to the overall package.

2666766,4,B000J3EB8K,"After years of success on CBS, then well-deserved recognition on the Game Show Network, the Match Game has been given the release for new and old fans alike: a box set edition featuring 30 of the most unique and hilarious episodes from various seasons (1973 - 1980). We all know how hilarious and improv the regulars were (Richard Dawson, Charles and Brett), but the nostalgic rewind of show guests such as KUKLA FRAN & OLLIE (hand puppets that you may have forgotten about), Don Sutton (MLB), and even Joan Collins are an exceptional welcome to this four-disc set.

As far as box-sets go, this catalog is pretty good, yet my center snaps in the box interior were all broken when it arrived from Amazon, which as a collector of '70s / '80s nostalgia, I found disappointing. I could have returned the set, but it is too funny to give up; night after night, my wife and I enjoy a different episode (30 total, with lots of clip samples and commentary from Brett Somers).  There have been complants regarding the cd coding and the inability to read in some players. This may be, in fact, a problem as my player too (which reads all formats incl. regions 0, 1, and so on) has 'frozen' a few frames here and there, but overall satisfying my watching pleasure.

My only concern with the box-set is that the bonus clips are from episodes featured on the collection that you'll see already once you watch the episodes. I imagine that copyrights were only granted to some of the episodes (or those that the distributor chose to 'buy' rights too) and the distributor made the most out of those episodes, including adding commentary as aforementioned by regular Brett Somers.

Overall, this is a nice set and one you will enjoy over and over again. It makes a great party set for company and you can even play along if you use your pause button and score points by matching everyone, including the panelists.",1168819200,5,1896,4.617210682492582

....now before I mention why I love it, I have to agree with some others about the defective DVD's....mine is too, and I have 3 different DVD machines in my home, ranging from cheap to expensive...all 3 machines won't let me view most of the 4th disc, and I still haven't been able to watch the pilot episode! Grrrrrrrr.  and of course I can't return it, it was a gift!

o.k. now, I LOVE Bret Sommers, I LOVE Charles Nelson Reilly, I LOVE Fannie Flagg and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Gene Rayburn....he is absolutely, hands down, the funniest, most layed-back, bestest game show host EVER!!!!

Richard Dawson, although a great answer giver, always comes across as smug and stuck-up, which I never noticed until now.  Which is another reason to get this set, it's great seeing how different these people are in your memory and how they come across now, when you're older!

I hope that high schoolers and college kids will pick up on this show and make a hit again.

I would encourage those of you that secured working copies let us know where you got your copies, since obviously Amazon is not the place to find them at this time.  I am sure many of us were excited that the DVD featured a 1962 pilot, which is the most defective part of the DVD.

The packaging was very attractive; it caught my eye.  The video and audio qualities are decent, but there are inconsistencies with the volume as there are on GSN.  Some of the tickets plugs are missing, mostly from the shows prior to 1979, which I did find disappointing.  Seeing the consulation prizes--thirty second inserts showing members of the studio audience, brought back a lot of memories.  I have tons of episodes taped off of GSN over the years, but I am missing a lot from MATCH GAME '75 & '76, so like a lot have said, it would have been nice to see more shows from those great years.  The B&W kinescope of the 1962 NBC pilot was nice to see, showing how it all started with Gene Rayburn and Johnny Olson.  Brett Somers' moments on the discs were quite nice; better than not having anyone from the show at all sharing memories, right?  Some shows I would not have selected as the best shows, but there are a lot of great ones, especially the school riot.  In any event, MATCH GAME will always be a true classic.  Hopefully more ""Best of..."" volumes will be released and maybe eventually complete years, since most of the shows are available, as they have been airing on GSN for quite some time.",1168300800,2,1353,4.522633744855967

2666777,4,B000J3EB8K,"I am a huge Match Game fan and love any version of the show.  That being said, I totally agree with some of the other reviewers that the set should have included more shows from the '74 to '77 era.  There was really alot of zany stuff that went on in the panel during those shows, making them the best ones in my opinion.  The later episodes '78-'81 which alot of the shows are from on this set, are way too edited and you don't get the interaction within the panel like you do in the older episodes.  Honestly, that's what made MG good.  The fact that the panel interactions were edited in the later years make those shows slightly less than great.  Really, I watch MG to hear the ""arguments"" between Brett and Charles or Brett and Fannie or Betty.  That's what makes for good tv.

That being said, I was also a little disappointed in the fact that none of the episodes featuring Fannie Flagg, my personal favorite semi-regular, featured any of her signature wacky shirts.  I would have liked to see at least one episode with one of her shirts that I have come to love her for wearing.  Or, since none of the episodes featured any of those shirts, they could have included in the extras either a photo gallery or a montage of different shirts she wore over the years.

Don't get me wrong, I am glad that I got the set and truly hope that they come out with ""The Best of Match Game: Volume 2"" and more, but as others have said, the quality could have been better and really as far as I am concerned they could have chosen better episodes to include in the set.  I didn't really need to see all five shows from the week Kirstie Alley was on, and for that matter didn't care for the episodes with her in them.

Overall, I would recommend this to all fans of MG and recommend that if they do come out with a 2nd volume that they take our suggestions and complaints into consideration.",1164844800,5,1881,4.279661016949152
2666778,5,B000J3EB8K,"These days, game shows are making their way onto DVD much more frequently, but not in the actual way some video owners have wanted. More games like Price Is Right, Family Feud and Let's Make A Deal are being made into DVD video games, not as home video. It is difficult for it to be equally mastered. Last year, Jeopardy tried to make it onto DVD video in good fashion. Sadly, it seemed more like it was about contestant Ken Jennings, and his reign as champion rather than the other recognized champions like blind champion Eddie Timanus, or others. Now, another game show classic has tried to make it happen, and this time it really is no blank at all, Match Game.

The Best Of Match Game is a 4 disc DVD reflection of one of the most legendary game shows of the 70's and early 80's. See some of the classics that legendary wild host Gene rayburn, and his band of merry blanking panelists, as they bring out the best in humor from the legendary classic CBS game show. The shows popularity within the past years has been extraordinary in the past few years on Game Show Network, later called GSN. Earlier this year, GSN named Match Game as the greatest game show of all time, according to their countdown of the 50 greatest game shows of all time, outranking longer-running shows like Jeopardy and Wheel Of Fortune. This DVD collection 30 episodes from this classic show in its 3 formats, the syndicated late 70's edtion, the CBS daytime version, and Match Game's nightime version, Match Game P.M.

There are many great episodes here that feature classic panelists Brett Sommers, Charles Nelson Reilly, and Richard Dawson, yes Richard Dawson before and while he began his reign as the original host of Family Feud, including a episode where Richard helps the audience start a riot, where he felt a ruling from a judge was improperly given, to a episode where Gene starts a fight, where he is playing tug of war with a cameraman for giving a improper shot. The set also features episodes with favorites including Kirstie Alley from the recent Jenny craig ads, when she was originally appearing just as a contestant who had won $6,000, and Michael Landon who was the first celebrity announced on the CBS daytime version in 1973. There also as extras from a tribute to the late Gene Rayburn, andd reflection from Brett Sommers herself, on some of her all time favorite moments from the show, from her point of view.

All in all, I just absolutely wish that there could've been more episodes of Match Game that were highlighted, but hopefully there will be. All in all, The Best Of Match Game is still a much better purchase for anybody who is into game shows like this classic blank. I definitely love watching this wonderful classic game show on GSN, and it is all new, fresh and exciting to me. If you haven't seen this classic game show at all, you really don't know how much fun you're missing. I love this show a lot, and I really recommend The Best Of Match Game on DVD. Dumb Dora really isn't so dumb after all.

2666779,4,B000J3EB8K,"I am a HUGE Match Game fan, and when I found out they were releasing it on DVD, I was ecstatic.  Having bought it and ran through some of the episodes (I'm currently on Disc 2) I decided to write this little review.

First off, let me say that this set IS NOT Digitally REMASTERED.  It is merely Digitally TRANSFERRED, meaning taking an analog VHS tape and transferring its contents to a Digital source- i.e. DVD.  There was no clean up of any video or audio of any kind, wich is disappointing.  Audio is presented in a mono format, which is fine for audio purists, but I expected more.  I wanted so much to hear Johnny Olsen say, ""Get Ready to Match the Stars!"" in surround sound! :)

In this set, you get 30 episodes of the ""Best"" of Match Game.  Some of the ticket plugs are kept in the episodes, and others are not.  Keeping the original product placements at the end was a nice touch.  However, there is no Play All function; that means that after every episode, it goes back to the menu after running through a couple title sequences- EVERY TIME!  It gets kind of annoying after a while.  One big disppointment is the fact that probably the most famous moment of Match Game was not included in this set: the hilarious Karen Lesko ""nipple"" incident from 1973!  If anything, a clip could have been included as part of the Best of Match Game special feature.

Be warned: On Disc 1, episode: 10/2/76. There is a major audio/vidoe sync error starting from 13:01 min to 14:34 min.  Several seconds of video is missing and caused the a/v to go out of sync.  This is corrected when the show comes back from commercial black.  Disappointing and unfortunate that this has happened in this day and age.  It should have been corrected.

Also the episode labled as the pilot is not actually the pilot; instead, it's the premiere episode from July '73.  The pilot featured a different ""Jackpot Round"" and had a few cosmetic changes.  The pilot has aired on tv, so this error shouldn't have been made, either.

One minor personal nitpick: many of the episodes (over half) are from 1978 or later, which doesn't make much sense, seeing as how Match Game's best years are generally considered to be from '74-'77.  That's when the panelists were at their zaniest, that's for sure!

The special features are pretty good.  Match Game regular celebrity panelist Brett Somers is interviewed and hosts a little special ""The Best of Match Game"" on every disc.  While it's great to see her, she's clearly reading from cue cards, and looks more than a little distracted.  In my opinion, there could have been more interviews with other celebrity panelists that have been on the show.  Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly were both on for 9 years, so they are the logical two, but where are the other fan favorites like Betty White, Marcia Wallace, Richard Dawson, and Fannie Flagg?  They all could have shared some fond memories on Match Game and, indeed, host Gene Rayburn.  And as a fan, I would have liked to have seen the GSN documentary, ""Match Game: Behind the Blank"" added to the set.  It would have been a nice addition and certainly shines a lot of information about Match Game and some of the panelists.

The packaging is awesome, I must say.  It's so '70s retro, it's almost ridiculous!  But that's the way it should be: tongue-firmly-in-cheek, the way Match Game was.  It even has some questions on it like, ""Dumb Dora is so dumb!  She tried to BLANK her birthday suit!""

All in all, it's a fantastic DVD collection that could have been made even better had the episodes simply been Digitally Remastered.  I don't necessarily mean HD quality picture and sound, but DVD quality.  Really, the monaural soundtrack has to go.  As for the collection of episodes, it's all a matter of opinion, but this collection is a pretty good one.  It's not definitive, that's for sure.  I would love to see another collection or two with all these problems fixed.  The Best of Match Game Volume 2, anyone?

You will also get to see the ""Match Game 7x will return in one minute"" plug in some of the episodes. In addition, they include the consolations prizes from sponsors. I have noticed with the Match Game PM there was some poor editing/cutting going on, but this may have been the way they were originally aired... since at the end of those episodes Johnny Olson says ""this program was edited for broadcast"". However, the earlier daytime 70s episodes are not edited so poorly. The eposides in the package were chosen well. Each episode has some sort of 'classic Match Game moment'. The episodes are hysterical!",1164585600,,841,4.727891156462585
2666782,4,B000J3EB8K,"Okay, that is my whine.  My one and only whine.

I never expected the day when Match Game would be out on DVD.  I am quite overjoyed.  The outfits, the smoking, the drinking, the risque (BLANK) questions, the era, all of it.  Great stuff!  Nice piece of tv history from a more civilized time.  :)

But the amount of material from 1978 onward makes up half the set.  MG (and Match Game PM) hit their most confident stride in 1975-1977.  Not that the latter-day episodes were bad, but there was some toning down and repetition of the questions.

Still, if this set sells well I can't see why another would be released.  And with over 1000 episodes taped, they could do this for years...

Few game shows transcend the ""Wanna win money"" theme.  Match Game was always entertaining and about the absurdity of the questions and, more importantly, coming up with clean answers to PG-rated questions.  (one can only fathom if a remade were to be made today; the censors would probably allow anything requiring a bleep to be said unbleeped.  The comedy isn't in being overtly lewd.  It's about being cute and poking innocent fun at folks who want to censor pretty much anything.  And that's what Match Game is; poking fun at overzealous censors.  Not being crude for the sake of being funny; this isn't about laughing at people passing gas.)

The extras were a TERRIFIC touch as well.  it's great to listen to Brett Somers reminiscing.  Her input, along with the other extras (Gene Rayburn's tribute, et al) are alone worthy of the price.

The restoration of these episodes is very good.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The video looks very clean as well.  There are some periodic tape dropout and other artifacts due to being stored for all these years, but they are few and far between and the quality of the basic remastering reveals very crisp and solid video.  And being on 4 single-sided discs is also a plus.

Definitely a must-have for fans, and a good rental for most anybody.",1164499200,7,1975,4.6138328530259365

2666784,3,B000J3EB8K,"Given that I love the Match Game, why only a 3-star rating?  Well, the most disappointing aspect of this set is that the episodes are NOT unedited -- contrary to the information on the box cover itself.  I haven't watched every episode yet, but the longest one I've watched so far ran only about 23 minutes.  That's about how long a TV show runs today, but TV shows had far fewer commercials during the 1970s so it's obvious that portions of the shows as they originally aired are missing from this dvd set.  Some of the edits are obvious as well:  jumps during the background music while the stars write their answers as well as periods of time so short that you know the stars could not actually have written their answers in that little time.  Basically these are the same chopped up versions running on GSN; the only difference is that none of it is sped up and the closing credits are intact.

As to the extras, I must admit to being quite disappointed with much of it.  The Q&A with Brett Somers was interesting to watch once.  The tribute to Gene Rayburn is okay but perfunctory.  The alleged best of Match Game moments feature is actually just clips from episodes on that disc itself with a couple of introdutions by Brett; unfortunately most of the clips are far from what I would call the best of the Match Game.  And while it was interesting to watch how the Match Game began in the 1960s, that episode was pretty dull.  Speaking of which, it's amazing to see some of the earliest episodes from the 1970s and to realize that without Brett, Charles, and some of the other zanier semi-regulars, this show would never have caught on.  Kudos to those involved at the time who realized that this show needed to be spiced up to be fun.

Video quality is very good but the audio suffers from inconsistent volume.

If you can get this set at a bargain price and love the Match Game (as I do), I think that this set is worth having despite all of my criticisms outlined above.  The Match Game is still my all-time favorite game show.

EDIT added 11/26/06:

After discussing this issue with another friend and people at another website, I've come to the conclusion that I am probably wrong and that the episodes on this box set are, indeed, the length of their original broadcasts.  I had assumed that daytime shows were similar in length to nighttime shows and I have learned that that was frequently not the case (daytime shows frequently had more commercials).  I would now upgrade my rating to 4 stars if I could.",1164412800,9,2518,4.492307692307692

We have delighted in the horror of smoking on television (no, we don't smoke, but it's so funny that blowing smoke all over the contestants was treated as normal back then), and even laughed ourselves ill at the outdated answers (they didn't even have pagers back then!). And don't forget -- best theme song ever! Great DVD to host a party to -- the possibilities are endless!",1421798400,,398,4.619718309859155

BEWARE: Discs 1-3 played flawlessly but I am having big problems with Disc 4. Out of the 10 selections on Disc 4, SIX are defective...1973 vol 6, July 28, 1975, August 4, 1979, September 8, 1979, 1962 pilot and the photo gallery do not either play or fully play. Some start off O.K. and then get garbled and are unwatchable. I tried different players, same problem. The Seller mentioned that the discs play fine, and for the most part they do, but the Seller obviously did not fully play Disc 4.

My suggestion, before making a purchase, contact a few sellers and ask if they have played all four disks without a hitch. I paid very little for this set and got them used, so am not angry but would be unhappy if I paid full price for new disks and encountered these problems.

Also, the show was best in the mid 70s when Richard Dawson was a guest. The later shows lost some punch to them. I only wish they had more shows between 1973 and 1975. I absolutely love seeing the people from this era, their hair styles, their clothing, it is like going back in a time warp and being there.",1407888000,,1245,4.271186440677966
