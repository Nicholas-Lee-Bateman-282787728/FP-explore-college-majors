8285348,5,B001BZGXUO,"Very cool item with some nostalgic footage from a time gone by. I am from Oregon and rent a cabin in the Central Cascade mountains that belongs to two retired USFS Rangers I know. The cabin has a nice collection of forestry dcor and memorabilia, including books, and some old movies to watch on DVD celebrating the outdoors. I bought this as a gift for their cabin and it makes a perfect addition.",1439856000,,397,4.4520547945205475
