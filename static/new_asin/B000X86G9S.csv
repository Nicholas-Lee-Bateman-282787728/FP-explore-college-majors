8227229,5,B000X86G9S,"I grew up in Germany reading Enid Blyton books. I loved the Famous Five (21 volumes) and the Adventure series which consists of 8 volumes. ""The Island of Adventure"" is the first of these 8 volumes and fortunately ""The Castle of Adventure"" was also made into a British movie way back then. Both are such a pleasure to watch.

Some 15 years later a TV production company from New Zealand made a TV series about Blyton's Adventure books and that one just doesn't have the right locations nor does it have the right feel to it. There simply are no castles in New Zealand, no Austrian Alps (The Valley of Adventure) etc.
The other issue about the TV series that bothers me is the fact that the stories have been modernized. That does not have to be the case. The remake of the Famous Five TV series from the mid 90's sets a good example how you can film a series of books which were written and set in the 40's and yet make them forties looking without being old-fashioned.

So enjoy these two films, but don't waste your time with the later Adventure TV series.",1401926400,,1196,5.060913705583756
8227230,5,B000X86G9S,"After a month of searching the net for this title which i loved as a child,i managed to buy a copy on VHS NTSC ex-rental from the states.
Interestingly enough the film was made in 1982 by Ebefilms (Enid Blyton's company), a british company and shot nearly entirely in cornwall.
Ebefilms were not interested in helping me find it, nor the distribution company. Shame Ebefilms doesnt remaster this movie and re-release it, as its a good childrens adventure film and also has the chap that played ""Frank Tate"" in Emmerdale in it as a british bondesque spy.",1232150400,,553,4.711340206185567
