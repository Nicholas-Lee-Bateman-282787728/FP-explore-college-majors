Blues (Double Feature)</a>The two films were great, especially KING CREOLE (which must rank as the greatest openings of any Elvis Presley movie), however, I was disappointed by Amazon's Product Review that the movie was 2.35.1 widescreen. At the top of the back cover it states that the two-disc package are both a ""WIDESCREEN VERSION ENHANCED FOR 16.9 TVs"", while at the bottom of the back cover it states that ""THESE FILMS ARE PRESENTED IN 'WIDESCREEN' FORMAT. THE BLACK BARS ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ARE NORMAL"" (which refers to 14.3 format TVs). I realise that the term ""widescreen"" is confusing as it can either refer to a widescreen movie (2.35.1) or a movie designed for a widescreen TV (1.33.1 or 16.9), but Amazon definitely states that the movies are 2.35.1. A few days later, today, I received another order from Amazon, the HERCULES COLLECTION box set, and of the 8 movies included 2 of them state ""WIDESCREEN EDITION"" which they are (2.35.1). One of these is HERCULES, starring Steve Reeves, and since I already had an Italian version from Cristaldi Films I was able to compare the two and they are both 2.35.1 originals. Back to Elvis Presley, I already had both KING CREOLE and G.I. BLUES in 1.78.1 (16.9) and was hoping to receive the widescreen (2.35.1) versions but was badly let down by Amazon and in disgust I crumpled-up the cover. Now I am not looking forward to receiving the two more Elvis Presley DVDs I have on order and must decide whether to return them without playing them as I will not know if they are 2.35.1 versions or not, unless they specifically state 2.35.1. Amazon is not alone in this deception (?) because I have 8 Elvis Presley movies in Paramount's WIDESCREEN COLLECTION, but some are 2.35.1 while others are 1.78.1, and so it goes on. The funny thing is that only a few months ago I didn't like the black bars at the top and bottom of the TV screen when playing 2.35.1 format movies, but I now have 46 and now they are my preferred format. I even went to my local electrical store to see if they had TVs that had a 2.35.1 format screen but was told they do not exist only as a laptop computer.",1347408000,,2315,4.878172588832487
8234850,5,B000Z6GT1S,"Ken' first review of G.I Blues which Elvis Preley plays a troubled teen who can't get along with his old man. He gets a job singing at a night club but the local mob boss,(played by Walter Matthau)Great singing & dancing in this movie. what can about King Creole except it is one of my wife's Kathy's Favorite movies & she has the whole set. Great theme, singing dancing and music. Great double collector Elvis Presley movies.",1256342400,3,426,4.545454545454546
8234851,5,B000Z6GT1S,"Pop some corn and settle in to watch this Double Pleaser. The first movie,King Creole, (Blk/Wht), is just Elvis' fourth film. He plays a troubled teen who can't get along with his old man.  He gets a job singing at a night club but the local mob boss,(played by Walter Matthau)
who owns the biggest club in the Big Easy, wants him for himself and always gets what he wants. Hot for Elvis is the Kingpins' own battered and lonely woman(Carolyn Jones) and naturally trouble ensues. Add some great dixeland rock  and a pretty descent performance by Elvis and we've got us a fine  pic. Hold on! Shows not over. Next, we have Elvis in  G.I. Blues, his first film after a two year stint in the Army. He plays guess what?, a G.I. who sings and swoons a night club dancer (Juliet Prowse), a cold fish his army buddies bet big bucks Elvis can't warm over. Will he succeed in getting the girl? Humorous situations and misunderstandings come along with a subplot that will keep you in your seat but wishing you hadn't drank all that soda along with your big bowl of popcorn! This is a Double Pleasing Double Feature well worth your hard earned money.",1244678400,6,1139,4.461538461538462
8234852,5,B000Z6GT1S,Great old films from The King's early career. A must-have for any Elvis enthusiast or just someone curious about Elvis' charisma and sense of humor.,1241827200,3,148,4.96
