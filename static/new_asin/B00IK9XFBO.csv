8642974,5,B00IK9XFBO,"The product came in on time (I think even early) and I appreciate the speedy delivery by the vendor (I highly recommend this vendor). GTB contains about 10-11 episodes and it's the start of the series. I wish Star Home Televideo squeezed in more, but I get that they will try to get more money by laying it all out on 20 billion dvds.

It's a feel good tv series and if you have a stressful day, watch some GTB to get some ""magic"" and positive energy.",1394496000,2,451,4.183908045977011
