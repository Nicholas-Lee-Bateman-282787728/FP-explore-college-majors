8354705,5,B0027HOBKE,We have several Thomas The Tank DVD's and we love them all. My grandson likes these better than any other DVD's he has. He will set entranced by the action and story line. And the songs - - - he plays and hums along.,1318291200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8354706,4,B0027HOBKE,"This is one of my favorites!  Whenever my 2-year old puts it in the DVD player, I have to sit down and watch it.

This was the first Thomas DVD I watched in CGI.  It was creepy at first, but after a while I warmed up to it.  It didn't seem to bother my son, and held his attention.

It was interesting to see the inside of the Locker Room at Knapford.  I had seen it in the minatures in the older shows, and often wondered what the inside of the buildings looked like.  Now I know!  It would be nice if we saw the inside of more offices.

I was quite surprised to see a live-action human in the show: Engine Driver Arkwright.  He brings an energy to the interludes.  He is very believable and engaging.  My son's favorite part is when he makes his ""sandwich with smelly Sodor cheese!""  Hope they will use the Arkwright character in more shows.  Maybe they could even bring a live-action Lady Hatt, or Sir Topham Hatt himself!

This is a good DVD for a rainy afternoon.  Recommended!",1272153600,3,982,4.227027027027027
8354707,5,B0027HOBKE,"Our 3 y/o grandson is really into Trains. Big trains, model trains and toy trains. All Thomas purchases we have made have been enjoyed and offered hours of entertainment for him. Thomas is not only entertaining but softly presents good lessons for getting along in life.
