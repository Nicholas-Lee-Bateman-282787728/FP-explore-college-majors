I am a sucker for romance, but I was very, very glad that there was no romance but a budding friendship. Don't pass this movie by.",1393804800,,307,4.310344827586207
8448311,4,B004YHN13I,"A similarity between Chalo Dilli and Plans, Trains and Automobiles is brief and unimportant. Vinay Pathak and Lara Dutta are excellent in this film that embraces rural India and different personality types. We like more music and dancing than there is in Chalo Dilli but the songs and a little dancing are good and fit nicely into the film.",1330732800,,340,4.779661016949152
8448312,5,B004YHN13I,"Ghalo dilli: this is not a romance movie, this is a funny movie with two different people who had to depend each other in order to get to their destination. Its funny because she is from a high class working women with all the gadget to surfive, his a peddler, I will not say what happens in the end...but I will say it's an entertainning movie.",1319587200,3,345,4.242424242424242
8448313,4,B004YHN13I,"Challo Dilli is the maiden venture of Lara Dutta's production company Bheegi Basanti.  An attempt at serious cinema, this film borrows heavily from ` Planes , Trains, and Automobiles and ` Due Date', about two individuals as different from chalk and cheese, are thrown together on a road trip. The couple consists of Vinay Pathak and Lara Dutta, he a a crass, gutkha chewing, gassy, man from Karol Bagh, New Delhi and she a top boss in a multinational company, full of sophistication and glamor. On this trip, from Jaipur to Delhi they meet a host of characters and after initial hesitation they start to form a friendship.
Vinay Pathak, is in terrific form as the lovable commoner and Lara Dutta, manages to spring an acting surprise. There is a twist at the end which is emotional as well as a surprising appearance by Akshay Kumar. A good watch. 4 stars. 9/15/2011",1317081600,3,867,4.703947368421052
