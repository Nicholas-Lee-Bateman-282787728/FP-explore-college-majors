8726965,1,B0133RPSJO,"The stage setting is interesting at the very beginning - Puccini opens a music box and ""time traveled"" to ancient China - and transformed to Calaf.  And that's the beginning of an awkward, chaos and coarse mashup without basic visual consistency.

You can see costumes from different generations, both eastern and western smashed on the same stage: 1960's Chinese fashion for Popolo di Pechino and later with some random martial art performer wearing cloth looks relatively recent. The guards are giving the impression of WWII Germany. Ping, Pang and Pong are wearing some cheap made cape with western suit underneath it. The butchers with knife look like someone coming out of a Japanese Samurai movie...

On the background we have Great Wall with Terracotta Army which has nothing to do with the story - the backdrop for emperor appearance is a sun glowing pattern commonly used extensively during cultural revolution in China from the 60's...

And Liu is wearing a funny hat which is very common in Chinese 60's, and his prince Calaf is dress up in a total western suit. His father Timur, the deposed king of Tartary is probably the only person who's wearing something relevant...

I tried to relate to the director's intention - a magical l time travel journey that different elements all come together in a totally random way, which could be very magical if it's done right...but unfortunately the whole opera is poorly produced.",1473724800,3,1434,4.958333333333333
8726966,3,B0133RPSJO,"I don't like ""modern"" staging.",1455667200,,30,5.2
8726967,5,B0133RPSJO,"Reviews of this performance are quite good.  I was captivated through the entire performance.  Video, surround sound, and production were all excellent.  The chorus and orchestra fills your room with delicious sound.  If you enjoy opera and want to experience it in your home, this is the blu-ray to purchase.",1452297600,2,309,5.12
