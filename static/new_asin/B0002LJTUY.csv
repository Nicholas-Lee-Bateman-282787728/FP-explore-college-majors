2103268,5,B0002LJTUY,"My 9 month old has already fallen in love with Yo Gabba Gabba so when I saw this movie, I had to get it.  She dances and sings along.  It cheers her up when she's cranky and keeps her occupied for a while so I can catch up around the house.  To adults, this may be a little weird but kids really seem to like it and the lessons it teaches are great.",1253664000,8,349,3.7534246575342465

2103287,4,B0002LJTUY,"Subject is pretty much it. If you're looking at this, you already know what they're about and some of the coolest episodes can be found here, even with the really odd film speed thing still in effect. If you don't know about YGG, this actually would serve as a pretty decent introduction to the lovable quirkiness of the show and characters.",1380240000,,341,4.60655737704918

2103292,2,B0002LJTUY,"one of the episodes on this disc constantly skipped the whole way through the episode, the rest of the episodes were fine, but that constant skipping....thats very surprising and totally unacceptable for any purchased item ESPECIALLY brand new and still wrapped in plastic! it was probably the shipping, but it couldve also been the manner it was stored n moved, people rush so much now days they aren't careful at all",1374710400,,418,4.901408450704225
2103293,1,B0002LJTUY,"Warning about the DVD's and not the show:

The episode ""Fun"" is on this one as well as the ""Circus"" DVD.

As if it weren't lame enough that Yo Gabba Gabba must be the only series in existence that does not have full seasons for sale on DVD, they goofed and released the same episode on two different DVD's. My son LOVES Yo Gabba Gabba and playing the show on Netflix was the only way I could keep him occupied while I cooked dinner, haha. It stinks to have what was already a shallow pool of episodes to watch diminished further.",1372118400,,529,4.227722772277228

2103304,5,B0002LJTUY,"We have and continue to purchase all the Yo Gabba Gabba books, DVD'S and other products and highly recommend them.
Halloween is one of our favorites and we were excited that we were able to purchase it on DVD.
Our Granddaughter is now 19 months old and has been watching Yo Gabba Gabba for the past year. I could not believe how early and quickly she tuned in to this program and how much she has learned and continues to learn. She loves dancey, dance and cool tricks and wants everyone to sing and dance along during the show. We have found that the lessons she learns stick with her and have been a great teaching tool for us. She has learned to shake off small hurts like falling when she runs to fast without tears. She just shakes, shakes, shakes it off. She learned about germs so we just have to remind her about the dirty, icky germs that will make her sick so she stops and does not put everything in her mouth.
Halloween was very helpful learning about costumes and made her more curious and less fearful of situations where people are in costume.

2103307,5,B0002LJTUY,"Our 2 year old LOVES this DVD so much, that I had to order another Yo Gabba Gabba DVD, just so I didn't have to keep hearing the songs from the first one!! ;)  My son watches it over, and over, and over again.  Great songs, that he has learned, and sings along with.  Highly recommend, to children that love music, and being entertained by DVD's (good for parents that need to get a chore done, while they watch, too ;)",1271808000,10,419,4.148148148148148
2103308,4,B0002LJTUY,"My daughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba! - I mean, LOVES the show.  However, my husband and I realized that the first animated sequence/song in the ""Halloween"" episode, which has spooky images and music in a minor key, would scare our 21-month-old daughter.  She'd start to cry when it came on and ran away from the TV and towards us to be picked up.  Hours later, it would take extra long to put her to sleep because she would not want to be alone in her room.  Unfortunately, it took two showings to figure this out ... After that, we'd have to skip the episode.

Yes, I know that kids shouldn't really be watching TV when they're under 2, but I'm surely not the only one to let my kid watch a little Nick Jr. - and who would expect a show on the network to freak out their kid? We've never had a problem with any other episode, though, and still love and recommend this show on the whole.",1264204800,2,884,4.207100591715976
