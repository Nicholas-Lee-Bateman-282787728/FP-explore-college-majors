834223,4,6304286503,Death Warrant is a highly entertaining Van Damme flick. Its very well done and this is one of Van Damme's better performances. Patrick Kilpatrick is aces as the great villain the sandman and the movie is intense. The supporting cast give solid performances as well especially the underrated and underused Joshua Miller as a fun computer whiz or should I say computer cowboy Lol. Also the underrated and extremely cute Cynthia Gibb is good as well. I just wish it had been a little longer with more development in the beginning with the sandman. Otherwise its a very entertaining prison flick.,1473033600,,592,4.871287128712871

And nobody comments, nobody explains, nothing. Pretty much sums up the movie- everyone is so wrapped up in late 80's-early 90's musclehead cheesiness that they don't really seem to pay attention much.

Bottom of the cover shows Van Damme kicking Attila from ""Lionheart"". Not the Sandman. Attila.

How could they mess that up? To put a bad guy from a previous Van Damme on this is a slip.

Still classic Van Damme",1363046400,,335,4.123076923076923
834412,3,6304286503,"It seems that Double Impact was the movie that made Van-Damme a star, while the martial arts-based B-movies that preceded it merely built his fame ever-so-gradually. Death Warrant is the odd-one-out in that regard as it is neither a Kickboxing tournament flick nor laughably awful. It seems to be set in some semblance of reality though the story never seems to be quite sure of what it wants to be or where to go.

Lewis Burke is a kickboxing Canadian Mountie (there's a sequence of words you never thought you'd read) who, in the opening moments of the film, guns down and kills demented serial killer The Sandman at point blank range with a .357 Magnum. Some time later he is sent undercover in an extremely corrupt prison to find out who has been serial-killing the inmates. Helping him out is Amanda Beckett (Cynthia Gibb, looking exactly like Emma Watson...only prettier) a lawyer who poses as his wife and feeds him information from the outside. Meanwhile, it turns out that The Sandman ain't quite dead (despite being shot many times with a .357 Magnum) and is seeking revenge. There goes Burke's cover.

Death Warrant (meaningless title, btw) was the first screenplay by acclaimed writer David S. Goyer (The Invisible, The Dark Knight trilogy) and you can identify his surreal trademark even at this early stage. However, the film builds and develops like a supernatural horror, yet is firmly grounded in the 'prison thriller' genre. The eventual revelation is very weak, and belongs in a totally different movie. If it had the nerve go all the way with the supernatural element it would have been much better. I would rather a movie aim for something higher, and fail, that aim for something low-wattage and dull (which Death Warrant unfortunately does) and 'succeed'. Patrick Kilpatrick (an edgy, nervous actor who you might recognize as Finn in Last Man Standing, or as the mercenary who unwisely challenges Penn's authority in Under Siege 2) is brilliant as the Sandman but he's given little to do. His presence in the movie feels out of place.

Deran Sarafian's slick direction makes a lot of use of light, shadow, and creepy cinematography, but with such a schizo script there's only so much he can do with it. A disappointment, but decent entertainment nonetheless.

MGM presents the movie in great-looking 1.85:1 1080p with decent DTS HD-MA 2.0 sound. The only extra is a trailer. While the movie is squarely average, the Blu-ray is certainly worth the money for fans.",1359244800,2,2485,4.895486935866983

834414,4,6304286503,Classic B movie action. A good transfer to blu-ray  but did anybody notice that the new cover has a scene from lion heart on it. seems like a pretty big mistake i mean come on its an entirely different movie.,1353888000,2,208,4.2
834415,3,6304286503,"Has Jean-Claude Van Damme ever made a movie where the plot is likable? Well the answer is yes. Lionheart, is among one of my favorite storyline by JCVD. Unfortunately he rarely makes movie that deviates from his bread and butter plot: he's trying to get home (or get his family back together) and something or someone is preventing that. He usually does strange kicks and other moves to get his stuff back together.

Death Warrant is a bit different from JCVD usual plot. At first the movie is very interesting. It actually hooks you in and draws your attention until some point near the end. JCVD is a Canadian police who pretends to go to prison in an attempt to find out why inmates are being killed. It gets interesting as JCVD tries to figure it out and it sounds like a macabre plot where organs are being black marketed after killing inmates in their sleep.

Unfortunately, the story deteriorates to a point where sense is no longer made. It turns out the very people that sent him to prison to uncover the mystery are the very people who are doing it (ignore sense for a while, here). Not only that, now they want JCVD and his lovely assistant dead and they send another inmate, Sandman, who is going to kill JCVD but is also his nemesis who was shot multiple times at the start of the movie but somehow lived.

Eventually the movie comes down to a question: is the action good enough? The answer is yes and no. The final fight of the movie is just ridiculous. It ends nearly the same as all his movies. JCVD getting some good moves in, everyone cheering for the bad guy - even hitting or saying harsh things to JCVD - then suddenly JCVD gets badly injured where he's holding his sides like he's badly wounded. Everyone is cheering wildly for the bad guy at this point and suddenly, JCVD musters up his last strength and starts doing flying kicks ignoring the injury to his side, and starts going on a rampage. Suddenly everyone starts feeling pity and remorse and actually starts cheering for JCVD and after he makes one final desperate flying kick, the bad guy goes down and everyone is cheering wildly for JCVD and pats him on the back like they were with him all along.

So in the end, the movie fails badly not because it's bad but because it's the same dang thing as all of his movies but with worser plot line.",1303776000,,2325,4.437939110070258
834416,3,6304286503,"The Sept. 14th./90 release of Jean Claude Van Damme's film Death Warrant,did well at the box office. Van Damme at the time was the up and coming new kid on the block and this fresh faced guy with the good physique and great martial moves caught movie goers attention pretty quick. He squeezed his way into the pack which included such established action stars as Chuck Norris,Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.
Death Warrant sees Van Damme as Louis Burke,an RCMP officer out of Quebec(I get a kick out of how the writers of his many films have come up with unique or funny ways to explain his Belgian accent!).The film opens as he is on a stake out and he is confronted by the Sandman played by Patrick Kilpatrick. In the canon of Van Damme films this character rates high as one of Van Damme's most evil and twisted nemeses. He fires several shots into the Sandman and he presumably goes down for the final count.
We next find Van Damme attending a meeting chaired by the Governor's assistant Tom Vogler(George Dickerson).It seems there have been a number of killings in the local pen and they want Burke to go into mole mode to find out the dope on what's going down. They cook up a phony rap sheet and plunk him into the slammer post haste and he's off,feet running. Being the new fish he's challenged quite frequently but the info he seeks starts trickling in.
With the help of two inmates,the Priest(Abdul Salaam El Razzac)and Hawkins(Robert Guillaume),Burke slowly finds out the truth. It seems the killings are not only a deadly secret amongst the guards but they are being orchestrated with outside help. They are deliberate killings of newer inmates to harvest their vital organs. On the outside Burke has the assistance of lawyer Amanda Beckett(Cynthia Gibb),who is his liaison and is posing as his wife. Both pool their info and when Amanda finally returns to let Vogler know of what they have discovered,she is confronted with a gun and the ugly truth. It seems Vogler himself deliberately orchestrated the killings initially so he could obtain a liver for his then dying wife. Since then the rest have been for profit. The only thing that saves Amanda from getting silenced permanently by Vogler is the interruption of the tete a'tete by Vogler's wife.
Meanwhile in order to silence Burke Vogler has had a notorious inmate transferred into the prison;none other than the man Burke thought he had killed at the beginning of the film,the Sandman!? In front of the inmates Burke and the Sandman go at it toe to toe. Burke at one point even kicks the Sandman into a fiery furnace,only to see him pop back out shorty after in flames. Getting back up for another go the Sandman is finally finished off for good. Burke leaves the prison,bloodied and into the arms of his new love Amanda.
The plot here while mundane is saved over and over by the solid acting of the cast. Stand outs include one eyed Robert Guillaume as Hawkins,the scary pop-eyed Priest,played wonderfully by Abdul Salaam El Razzac and Sgt Degraf played dog-mean and tough by Art Lafleur. It is the characterizations over plot that dominate the entire film and bring the grittiness of the prison environment to life. The film loses its' impact because it gets off to a shaky and rather slow start. The opening scenes while establishing a raison d'etre for events to transpire later are left to hang with absolutely no thread to join the rest of the plot to,until near the end of the film. And when we finally get that the connecting thread is the Sandman,our credulity is stretched to the max. Burke had pumped enough lead into that creep to fill a 45 gallon drum in the opening but yet near the end he's up and walking around no worse for wear. The Sandman's taunt that he""can't be killed"" still doesn't get us totally past this imagination stretch. Is he supernatural? Not likely as Burke does eventually dispatch him to his maker. We're just left to wonder how.
Technically this film DVD release of 2001 while clear could use a proper remastering as it can get a bit too grainy. It is however in in its' original a/r of 1:85:1. It comes with no special features to speak of,is on a one sided disc and is in a thick keepcase.
In conclusion Death Warrant is short on plot but long on memorable characterizations due to its' solid cast. The plot meanders for the first while until settling into a nice groove about 20 minutes in. It is one of his earlier efforts and just an average film. I find it funny that a later and far more outstanding film of Van Damme's like Legionaire(and several others)wouldn't do the box office that this film did. Don't ya just love Hollywood!",1294272000,,4658,4.654126213592233
834417,3,6304286503,"""Death Warrant"" is one of the least popular of Van Damme's films from this era. Its obscurity is not due to lack of distribution like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;or lack of quality like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Eagle/dp/6305232768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Eagle</a>&nbsp;- it simply just doesn't stand out inbetween the other stuff he did during this time. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good offering from the Muscles from Brussels before he went entirely mainstream, but it has a definite throwaway feel to it: the story's been done before, the fight scenes aren't anything out of the ordinary, and the characters aren't fun enough to care much about. ""Death Warrant"" doesn't have anything wrong with it other than how generic it is, but coming from a time when Van Damme's flicks were at least moderately creative, this hurts the film more than it would have otherwise.

The story: Canadian policeman Louis Burke (Van Damme) - a hero after catching a vicious serial killer called 'the Sandman' (Patrick Kilpatrick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>) - goes undercover in prison to investigate a series of slayings among inmates. Reluctantly aided by a weathered convict (Robert Guillaume,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benson/dp/B000Q6GUJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benson</a>) and a feisty attorney posing as his wife (Cynthia Gibb,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gypsy/dp/B00079HZTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gypsy</a>), he uncovers a heinous trafficking scheme of the deadliest sort.

Thirteen years after the theatrical release of this one, Van Damme would revisit the prison subgenre via the direct-to-video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Hell/dp/B0000DBJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Hell</a>. While the DTV flick was a gritty, unsettling spectacle that emphasized realism of incarceration, ""Death Warrant"" is a fairly easy-to-digest macho yarn devoid of rape and a sense of despair and hopelessness. Sure, you have the given unpleasantries of the sadistic warden (Art LaFleur,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Clause-2/dp/B00005JLQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa Clause 2</a>) and racial/gang tensions, but the realism ends there: it seems the only time the prisoners are not milling around the entire facility at their leisure is when it's inconvenient to the plot, and a dealer/pimp character played by Abdul Salaam El Razzac is not only allowed to have the entire basement of the prison to himself but is somehow also in possession of a cell phone which Burke can use to call the outside. I'm not a stickler for realism, but I think that last bit is pushing it.

For a Van Damme movie, this one really doesn't have a lot of action. Forget about gunfights and car chases entirely, but don't count too much on the martial arts content either. Amidst a meager smattering of token roundhouse kicks, Van Damme only has two real one-on-one encounters: the first one against Hollywood's premier Asian enforcer Al Leong is decent but forgettable even though the two of them wield a chain and mop handle to painful effect, whereas the second one - the showdown with the Sandman - is memorable for Kilpatrick's truly threatening presence as the killer but is more of a brawl than a karate fight. This overall lack of martial thrills is disappointing but the film still feels complete thanks to rounded script by Hollywood heavyweight David Goyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins/dp/B000BUYP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins</a>) and the endearing performance of Robert Guillaume as Burke's ally. It actually feels less like an action outing than a genuine thriller...though one with very little character development and plot implausibility out the butt.

Cumulatively, what we have here is a fairly by-the-numbers Van Damme outing wherein he gets the girl, shouts a lot, and gets to deliver a slow-motion flying kick. This ought to be enough for fans, but what with it being bookended by films more significantly defining to his career, I'd be surprised to find many people who claim this as their favorite. There's no reason not to pick it up other than using it to represent Van Damme's filmography as a whole: again, this one's good, but it's not nearly his best work.",1278720000,,4759,6.41965678627145
834508,5,6304286503,"What a great Van Damme film! Here, JCVD is Louis Burke, a detective who goes undercover trying to find who's behind the mysterious murders happening in a prison. I didn't go into this movie expecting too much, usually I feel that prison movies are a bit too confining and a bit tired but I was really surprised.

 The characters really make this worth seeing. Pat Kilpatrick is creepy and awesome as sandman. Cynthia Gibb does a great job as the attorney helping JC from the outside,she's smart and every bit as compelling as Van Damme,which is kinda rare for these 90's action movies. Robert Guillaume and Abdul Razzac are pitch perfect supporting actors as well as Art LaFleur as the racist prison warden rounding out a terrific cast of characters that really draw you into the story. The action featured here was very good and the mystery aspect was done very well with each of the actors really adding something to the plate drawing me into the story as they uncover more and more clues.

 Towards the end, the tension really ramps up when a serial killer named the Sandman resurfaces to make his life hell. At that point you just know things are going to get crazy and the resultant brawl between the two has got to be one of the best I've seen. The sheer brutality and pacing of it is fantastic but this isn't just a Van Damme movie, this is a great 90's action film with a wonderful cast that makes sure that the martial arts doesn't completly steal the show. Whether you're a JCVD fan or not, this is a very suspensful little action gem that you should see.",1257724800,4,1565,4.5
834509,3,6304286503,"Jean-Claude Van Damme's martial arts extravaganza is bolstered by some fine editing, a dark, scary soundtrack, and some mighty fine camera work.  Despite some B-level acting (except for Robert Guillaume as a supply doling inmate) director, Deran Sarafian, keeps the whole affair rolling along well enough to provide some key suspenseful moments.  The plot involves police investigator, Louis Burke (Van Damme), who becomes a mole in prison while investigating a deadly crime ring while the elusive ""Sandman"" lurks in the background with nine-lives more reminiscent of Michael Myers than a super criminal.  Although this element breaks up the film's credibility somewhat, it ups the tension as well.  In the end 'Death Warrant' is a lively hour and a half movie that has enough going for it to make you forget its weaknesses.

1.  Who is he? He's Detective Louis Burke, who goes undercover as a prisoner in a penitentiary with a lot of unexplained deaths.
2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged? His partner was murdered by a maniac named Sandman.
3.  Does he take his shirt off?  Not only does the Sandman homoerotically remove Louis' shirt in the shower, but in the climactic final battle, Louis is pressed up against an iron furnace door.  Naturally, this singes the shirt to smithereens, and Sandman kindly removes the rest.  Sandman has clearly been in prison too long.
4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  Unless there was a deleted scene with his cellmate, I don't think so.
5.  Is there a tournament?  As far as I'm concerned, being in general pop. at a penitentiary IS a tournament.
6.  Is training needed for this tournament? The only training needed was in regards to a firm grip on the soap when showering.
7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? Only in the shower room.
8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  No.  I don't think he wants to insinuate anything to the larger prisoners.
9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  There are approximately 78 spin kicks in this movie; Louis only receives about 3 of them.
10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  He may be the most unstoppable force JCVD has ever met.  Let's put it this way: Louis shoots the Sandman five times early in the movie, and the Sandman survives.  Later, the Sandman gets kicked into a 1500 degree Celsius blast furnace, gets out, does a little stop-drop-and-roll, and is ready to fight some more.
11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Early in his fight with Sandman, Louis gets hit in the face with a two foot wrench.  So, I guess that counts.
12.  Does he win? After impaling the Sandman on a bolt sticking out of some piping, and getting taunted, Louis calmly walks over scrambles the Sandman's brains - just picture the process by which McFlurries are made at McDonald's and you have a good idea.

With grunting and mono-syllabic lines galore, the true genius of everyone's favorite Belgian homunculus is in full force with Death Warrant.  Not only that, but the sound effects are incredibly trumped up for this one, with every kick and punch accompanying a swoosh through the air and finishing with a thud into raw meat.  The ""organ harvesting with the help of corrupt police""-angle is also an oddly interesting one for a JCVD movie.  Overall, this isn't the best of his oeuvre, but it's got a few hardcore battles that will have you air-punching to get in on the action.  This is solid JCVD gold.",1220400000,20,2662,4.578389830508475

834513,4,6304286503,"I want to go with 3 stars on this film, but some part of me says there is enough fun in Death Warrant to go with 4 stars.  You can't expect more than a typical prison movie with this one - the crazy inmates, the corrupt guards, the big prison villain, and the undercover cop - played by Van Damme.  Unlike the movies that Van Damme continues to make today, this is one of his older titles, which means a younger and more skilled Van Damme.  Although there are not an abundance of fights in this film, Death Warrant displays the powerful moves of the great Van Damme we once knew.

Fun is the name of the game, although it weird to say the word ""fun"" when referring to a prison movie.  Well, its the kind of fun entertainment that pits an undercover cop named Louis Burke into a prison, simply to investigate the numerous deaths that have been occuring there.  We get to see hundreds of weird, insane, and crazy inmates - many of whom get a bit too close to Van Damme's face, thus creating your typical prison fights and what not.  There are the usual corrupt guards as well, once again stirring up some havoc on the side.  And then there's the one guy that forms an allegiance to help out our investigator, who is played by Robert Guillaume.

As usual, its all about the action.  As mentioned, I had hoped for more fight scenes, but when there is one, boy they are tough and hard hitting.  The best obviously is going to be the last fight of the movie, against a really weird guy named ""The Sandman"".  He appears in the beginning of the film, and we assume he is killed by Burke.  Closer to the end of the film, he is alive and well, and enters the prison, with his eyes set on Burke for revenge.  Their fight is at least 5 minutes, and is accompanied by an audience of screaming inmates watching from all corners.  Its an evenly matched fight, as both guys get to do some serious damage.

Death Warrant is probably one of my lesser favorites from the early Van Damme movies which include Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Lionheart, Double Impact and Hard Target.  But compared to his more recent films, you won't find this kind of action in them.  Pick it up to complete the classic Van Damme collection.  Though the movie might be a bit cliche, its a chance to add some more great Van Damme action to the pot.",1184803200,4,2301,4.33411214953271
834514,5,6304286503,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Death Warrant was filled with supense and action.

Eventually officer Burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars.

I did not lose interest with the nonstop suspense and action.

Sincerely,

834515,4,6304286503,"Plot: There has been a string of unsolved murders at Harrison Penitentiary. Detective Louis Burke (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is sent undercover as an inmate to investigate. With the help of his assigned ""wife"" (charatcer Amanda Beckett, played by Cynthia Gibb), he manages to uncover a few dirty secrets about the place. Once he truly gets into the heat of the situation, he discovers that the guards and prison officials themselves might even be involved. The whole scheme is starting to make sense, and that doesn't stay a good thing for long. His presence at the prison is becoming too much of a danger for the conspirors, and he becomes next on the hitlist. But Burke isn't going down easy. At least that's what we think, until an old enemy -- Christian ""The Sandman"" Naylor (Patrick Kilpatrick) -- is transferred to the prison to finish him off for good. The fight to solve the murder mystery is over, yet the fight for Burkes life is only beginning.

Death Warrant is an action flick. Period. Although the story can be interesting to follow, the true reason anyone would watch this would be for the down'n'dirty mayhem with Van Damme in his usual kick-butt mode. The prison conspiracy is not a huge government cover up, but rather a small ring of corruption hidden from higher officials. So instead of a thriller with a bunch of different suspicious characters involved, we've got Van Damme stuck all alone in the deadly prison without a prayer! That's where the action comes in. This isn't the kind of ""blow stuff up"" or ""shoot em down"" popcorn movie, this is hand-to-hand combat with girtty intensity. And the best example for that would be the grand finale: the final fight between The Sandman and Burke (definitely my favorite part). That's where anything goes, and barbaric brawling to the death is the only way out. And on that note, I was particularly fond of Patrick Kilpatrick as The Sandman. He often can be seen in villain-type roles, but this just hits the nail on the head. The only slight complaint I have (and the reason it only hits four stars) is that The Sandman doesn't have enough screen time. I don't want to spoil the storyline, but you can assume that because of his late arrival in the film, he's not the mystery murderer. He's more like an executioner sent to do Burke in. For the parts he does get in the last half of the film -- as well as the first scene in which we see an encounter between Naylor and Burke when Naylor is a free man -- are satisfying, but let's face it, he's one hell of a villain and he needed more show. Regardless, Death Warrant is just what you need if you like a simple yet engaging fight flick. And although the only special feature is a theatrical trailer, the only reason you need to purchase this DVD is the film itself. It's quite impressive, and leaves you with some fond memories of both Van Damme and Kilpatrick. Pick it up!",1133827200,,2887,4.584139264990329

The only question is how did this film get released? It's the greatest comedy I've ever seen and it's meant to be an action film.

The film heats up when Van Damme's arch-rival, a psychopathic killer who for some reason, which is never explained, can withstand bullets and other fatal moves, shows up at the prison and exposes him as an undercover cop.
If you're in for Van Damme, you know what to expect though this is a lot slower and less action-filled than a lot of his other features.",1059350400,2,501,4.5777777777777775

He encounters ""The Sandman"" and fights him in front of the whole ward. ""The Sandman"" thought he was smooth by breaking a lightbulb and trying to hurt Van Damme with it. He didn't succeed and Van Damme kicked him with his trademark noise and facial expression. Ultimate appreciation for that lord.

The Sandman was pretty clever by breaking a lightbulb over Van Damme's face, but Van Damme jumpkicked him into a furnace, yes! But wait, the Sandman jumped out of the furnace on fire, pure hilarity!

834655,4,6304286503,"As a longtime afficianado of the Van Damme oeuvre, I can honestly say that this film does right by the requisite cliches (where prison movies are concerned), and is actually not bad for repeated viewings.
Similar in pace to Stallone's ""Lock-Up"" and slightly less entertaining, but still pretty good, ""Death Warrant"" gets higher marks than it should because of the action (well-choreographed until the climax, which is stricly by-the-numbers Van Damme signature moves), the moody lighting and production accuracy, and Robert Guillaume and Patrick Kilpatrick as the veteran inmate and omnipotent nemesis, respectively.
Van Damme still had a few films to go before he reached his peak, but this was a step in the right direction.",1005782400,,726,5.267241379310345
