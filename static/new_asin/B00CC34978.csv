5713578,1,B00CC34978,"It feels like we just had this conversation, so for those of you that didn't make it to the Burt Wonderstone review, it went something along the lines of:  some television stars don't always translate very well to the big screen.  Well, much like Steve Carrell in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, here we are again with big time, little screen actress, Tina Fey (she masters her television craft on NBC's 30 Rock).  A few years back, Tina Fey and Steve Carrell took to the big screen in a film called, Date Night, which you might have safely assumed would translate to a rivetingly funny film experience.  There's only one little problem with that:  it wasn't funny and more importantly, she wasn't funny.  The point is (and yes, we've gotten a little off base here) just because Tiny Fey has a boatload of television awards doesn't mean she has what it takes to make it on the big screen.  Although, in her defense, she hasn't really taken on an overpowering film role as she does in the quaint little comedy, Admission.

Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie & Little Fockers), Admission stars Tina Fey as Portia Nathan, an ambitious Princeton University admissions officer that stumbles upon a high school prodigy student, Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff), in a back woods high school run by the free spirited John Pressman (Paul Rudd).  After her initial visit to the high school, Portia is caught off guard when Pressman tells her that she is the mother of the prodigy (the child she gave up for adoption).  Pressman informs Portia that Jeremiah desperately wants to attend Princeton, but doesn't have the credentials that are typically required to get into Princeton - thus seeking her help to get him admitted.  Michael Sheen, Lily Tomlin, and Wallace Shawn also star in supporting roles.

It should be no surprise to hear that this is Tina Fey's best performance to date on the big screen - since she obviously doesn't have an extensive resume in that department just yet.  However, her character is a bit of a scatter-brained elitist that is difficult to sympathize with or relate to at any point of the story.  Upon first meeting her character, she's in a direct competition to become the next dean of admissions for Princeton, and the next thing you know, she goes to a random high school, meets its random supervisor, culminating in him telling her (randomly) that he has found her son - and naturally her next reaction is to make out with him.  By any definition, that's either a pretty unorthodox trip - or really bad storytelling.

In any event, Admission is a comedy with the best of intentions at heart.  It's certainly an interesting story as it unfolds (depicting an extremely bothersome college admission process), but at the end of the day, it's still a comedy, and comedies are supposed to be funny.  The film has a few of those embarrassing ""I just can't look"" moments, but for the most part, the humorous moments come from Lily Tomlin in her portrayal of Portia's uptight mother.  Straight out of a high school student's worst nightmare, one scene has Tomlin firing a shotgun at Paul Rudd as he drops Portia off at her mother's house - a scene in which Tomlin's character humorously misinterprets as an unwanted romantic advance on her daughter.

Other ""comedic"" scenes, however, do not work so well in the film.  One particular scene is meant to depict the prodigy student as ""too smart for the rest of us"" as he does a ventriloquist act at a birthday party.  Elitist jokes are all fine and dandy - if they work for the scene.  Yet, just because a kid displays a great deal of charisma and rattles off the names of a bunch of classic authors that most people have never heard of doesn't necessarily entitle him admittance to Princeton.  It's truly unfortunate that scenes like this try so hard to be smart, only to miss the mark and land right on their face - thus severely handicapping the quality of the film.

Overall, the premise of Admission is sound, yet the dialogue and whacky plot are too ambitious for their own good.  A few cheap laughs every now and then can't overshadow a plot that's unsustainably choppy and unemotional.  Fey and Rudd get average marks for chemistry, but in the end, there's very little value to be seen here.

5713579,3,B00CC34978,"Towards the end of Admission, an English professor describes a performance he had just witnessed as, ""Weird...but I liked it."" The same can be said about the film, Admission. While it's probably not the movie you expected to see, it inspires some genuine curiosity as it moves along.

Tina Fey plays Portia Nathan, an admissions officer for Princeton University. Daily, Portia avoids the wonton glare of prospective students who seek the secret to ""getting in."" She spends most of her time weeding through application files with the hefty task of personally deciding which students are admitted and which students are denied. It's a cute premise, but hardly one that can keep a film narrative afloat for long. Enter Paul Rudd as John Pressman. Pressman runs an unorthodox school that would rarely attract the attention of the likes of Princeton, except Pressman believes one of his students could be the son Portia gave up years ago. This news arrives precisely at the time when Portia finds out her boyfriend (Michael Sheen) has impregnated another woman and is leaving her.  To make matters more stressful, Portia learns that the Dean of Admissions (Wallace Shawn) is retiring and is considering either Portia or her rival admissions officer Corinne (Gloria Reuben) as his replacement.

These complications allow Admission to explore some more interesting territory. The movie does have a bit of an uneven tone, however. On one hand, there is Rudd and Fey, two comedic talents working hard to downplay their goofy personas into something more serious, with mixed results. On the other hand, there is a drama trying to downplay its serious tone for something more comedic and romantic, with mixed results. What we end up with is something, for lack of a better term, ""weird."" Lilly Tomlin works very well as Portia's mother who raised her with tough love, but perhaps too tough, and it is charming to see a film bold enough to partially set its climax in an Office of Admissions meeting. However, the film does try to bite off a bit more than it can chew, especially in its commentary on how to live one's life. Portia is constantly berated throughout the film for enjoying a simple life while Pressman is a firm believer that one should never stay too long in one place. Both philosophies are hollowed out and filled with stereotypes leaving director, Paul Weitz with little hope of giving the audience a satisfactory answer.

Admission is a surprisingly odd movie. It takes a few risks with its tone, style, and story, and not all of them pay off, but overall, Admission is worth the price of admission. B",1364774400,5,2608,4.893665158371041
5713580,3,B00CC34978,"I couldn't wait to see ""Admission"" after seeing the trailer for it weeks ago, and was there on opening night to show support for it and as a fan of the three leads, Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, and Lily Tomlin.  The film started off promisingly enough, but somewhere midway through it started to sag, and at times became painful to watch.  At this moment I'm thinking of a spectacularly unfunny scene where Tina and Paul are helping a cow give birth, and Tina's character's ""improvised"" jokes about soothing the cow are like a bad, bland sitcom.  Frankly, it's hard to believe this film made it through any test screenings well, and I'm surprised it made it all the way to a major nationwide release.  It really is a straight-to-DVD release overall.  The one person who saves it when she shows up onscreen is Lily Tomlin--this won't hurt her career at all, and will likely serve her well in getting her cast in even more roles in the future (not that she needs any help--she's almost always magic onscreen).  This film won't hurt Tina or Paul, either, because of their past successes--I'd still jump to see anything they do in the future as well (separately or together)--but neither is served well by the screenplay or director here (or editor, for that matter).  And Paul, if you're trying to transition to more ""serious"" roles (read older, blander Dad roles) now that you're older, please don't--you'll be just fine playing your trademark off-kilter characters for many, many years to come.  Don't let your forty-something self worry about such things.  I only gave this film 3 stars because it's still a pleasure to watch Tina, Paul & Lily in pretty much anything (and when this film works, you find yourself forgiving the really bad parts), and Amazon's rating system says 3 stars equals an ""It's OK"" rating.  And yep, this film is just...OK.",1364688000,,1839,4.736677115987461
5713581,3,B00CC34978,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  This seriocomic movie somewhat confounded me.  Like many others, I suspect, I expected an uproarious laugh-a-minute satire of the capricious college admissions process, somewhat in the vein of ""Back of School"", especially with the supremely talented Tina Fey in the lead.  Instead, ""Admissions"" is a lower-key, Woody Allenesque observation of frustrated, unfulfilled lives and misplaced good intentions.  Mind you, the movie has its incisive, accurate humor (especially about college decision dynamics) and an agreeable if turbulent relationship between Fey's and Paul Rudd's characters, and I generally enjoyed it, but it feels just a little bit ephemeral and insubstantial.

  Then again, Fey's character Portia Nathan (who reminded me of Diane Keaton, especially in ""Baby Boom"") is a bit insubstantial and tentative.  Portia has a job suited to her personality - one of Princeton's admissions officers.  Even though being an admissions officer is not your conventional prestigious position, it is nevertheless an influential one because it can affect the academic and professional futures of so many college applicants.  The job is an ideal combination of safe, respectable and empowering, apparently perfect for Portia, since she's been doing it for 16 years.  Besides a comfortable job, she also has a comfortable relationship with a literature (I think) professor Mark (Michael Sheen).  Of course, comfort zones like this seldom last long in the movies.

  During one of her college recruitment jaunts in New Hampshire (part of the Northeastern territory), Portia locates a very remote experimental farm-like, self-sustaining, rural high school run by the affable, down-to-earth, and globally-minded John Pressman (Paul Rudd) who may be a potential love interest.  At the school, she also meets lanky, soft-spoken, but talented auto-didact (self-tutored) Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff).  Naturally, at first, Portia doesn't notice anything particularly special about either one of them.  But when John produces a birth certificate suggesting Jeremiah may be the son Portia gave up for adoption years ago, it seems to awaken a dormant maternal instinct within Portia.  Jeremiah rises in her estimation, especially when she learns that despite an undistinguished school record, Jeremiah has aced his SATs and Achievement Tests without any test preparation classes. John begins to look better to her, too, since he has helped nurture Jeremiah's future.  Furthermore, the patronizing Mark has dumped Portia for some dismissive East European.  Portia thinks she has found a way to enhance her status at Princeton, her social life, AND her family life in one fell swoop.  She'll do it by fighting tooth and nail to achieve Jeremiah's dream of getting into Princeton AND maybe even impressing the available John in the process. She'll make Jeremiah and John as well as herself happy and fulfilled. But, in this case, Portia (and perhaps others) may have cared not wisely but too well. You know what good intentions pave.....

  Again, ""Admissions"" is an enjoyable, if low-profile comedy that does manage to examine the meaning of ""admissions"" in both an academic AND life sense.  For me, the movie did a better job with the academic admissions angle, by exposing the imposing, intricate, agonizing, and seemingly arbitrary college student admissions process.  I especially liked the trite but still funny fantasy visualization of what happened to students who were denied admission.  I also liked seeing the office blackboard filled with colorful responses from parents who called Princeton to demand why their kid did not get in.  I think the movie got it right there, and I wish ""Admissions"" had devoted more time to it.  As for the personal admissions angle, I found it murky, uncertain but still interesting because it showed, in Portia's case, that admitting the truth may make you miserable, but it will set you free to start anew.

P.S.:  For the record, Lily Tomlin plays Portia's assertive, free-spirited mother Susannah, who also has admissions to make.  Wallace Shawn (""My Dinner with Andre"", ""The Princess Bride"") plays the officious, publicity-conscious Clarence, Princeton Dean of Admissions.  Finally, Travaris Spears plays the superfluous but vibrant and independent-minded Nelson, John's adopted son. One other thought, I commend the movie, and ""Princeton"", for its courage in showcasing the matriculation process of a real school, as opposed to the fabricated universities we see too often in the movies.",1364169600,5,4562,5.457917261055635
5713582,3,B00CC34978,"Very engaging first half or so, with some very funny situations; bright, intelligent script; snappy direction; groovy locale shooting. (Sure *looked* like Princeton...why no scene at the Princeton Record Exchange? no plug).

I don't want to give away the plot...though the director seems to have THROWN IT AWAY at about midpoint, I say redundantly. But talk about taking a really interesting, relatable idea and making it as complicated as possible! As complicated as the characters are: Lily Tomlin plays Tina's Mother..still the hippie...but completely without the love and the peace. She tells Tina that she is child of lust...then jumps into the sack on her first half-date with a longtime, secret admirer (she was an activist in the '70s and he was a hippie sympathizer/male feminist - who happens to be involved in the admissions process of a gifted guy who lacks the creds but has made it on a ridiculously high IQ. And who too just might be the fruit of some labor of lust?).

While Tina is trying to sort all of that out....she reluctantly restarts a relationship with a guy from the past - who is the self-appointed mentor/promoter of the afore-mentioned child-genius.

How did this woman ever get hired at Princeton, 16 years before? Maybe then she had some respect for the institution and its' recruitment process?

Enough! Go see it please for Tina and Lily and guess who? Wallace Shawn! - the dude from a Taxi episode and My Dinner With Andre! - and let all reality be...... ""denied"".

5713583,3,B00CC34978,"As I watched this flick, I said, ""I think lots of women over the age of 35 will enjoy this.""  If reviews have been critical, it's becaus viewers were expecting a yuck-yuck fest and this is not it.  This film was about issues that affect women as they age.  Did they throw away their lives to their careers?  Did their mothers raise them poorly but yet want to be critical of them?  Is it better to tell the ones you love truths or lies?  Do I relocate or do I stay put, and what if my child disagrees with me?  And most importantly for me: WHY DIDN'T THIS DAMNED IVY LEAGUE DEGREE MAKE ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE!?!?!?  To me, the biggest dynamic was not romantic; the vibe between Tina and Paul wasn't really that important.  The main tensions come from the trio of parent-child schisms.  This reminded me of Steven Martin's ""Parenthood"" in some ways.  I couldn't sit through that ""Secret Ya-Ya Whatever.""  However, this reminded me of the flick with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin.  If you know how few roles exist for aging women and how few movies put them at the center, rather than the margins, then you will appreciate this work.  It's debatable whether it could be called feminist, but if you want more films to come out that don't sweep older women under the rug, then  you really should support this film.  (And by the way, the screenit website said this movie was heavy on nudity and there was not nudity in it whatsoever.  The scopophile in me felt tricked.)",1364083200,40,1466,4.451127819548872
5713584,2,B00CC34978,"I was misled by an enthusiastic review of this movie in The New York Times.  The problem is that the movie is rather schizophrenic - it can't decide whether the story is about college admissions or the soap opera life of our heroine (a college admissions officer at Princeton).  Yes, I got the dual nature of the title - that admissions, whether to college or to other people, are good.  There is just not enough of either side of this equation and it is way too light on the laughs for humor to carry it along very successfully.  A few jokes, yes.  A few funny situations, very few.  And that's about it.

By the way, in spite of the nearly universal  critical appreciation for Tina Fey's gifts as a comic actress, she was practically expressionless during the movie and rarely showed emotion in any way.  I just don't get the praise she has received.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is affable and endearing, as he so often is.  The totally unnecessary role of his son is played by a young actor who gives more verve to his lines than Tina Fey does for hers.  Lily Tomlin steals the show every moment she is on screen.

I'd have to say that it is better to wait until it is on tv for free; then, you can enjoy it with a bowl of popcorn and lowered expectations.",1363996800,5,1262,4.296610169491525
5713585,4,B00CC34978,"Here is Maternal Instinct run amok! When Tina Fey's character was much, much younger, she secretly gave up a child for adoption. Now she might have run into him: She's an admissions officer at Princeton and he is a brilliant student from an alternative school, applying for admission.

We enjoy:
  * Tina Fey (""Date Night"") is the admissions officer, up for a big promotion and down for the count with her 10-year live-in lover.
  * Nat Wolff (""New Year's Eve"") is that would-be student, an autodidact (self-taught) candidate under the scrutiny of the admissions committee.
  * Paul Rudd (""This is 40"") is the student's faculty adviser, a much-traveled do-gooder who will be off for Uruguay next.
  * Lily Tomlin (Lots of TV) is Tina Fey's mom, a militant feminist. If you don't believe me, just watch her with a gun!
  * Wallace Shawn (""A Late Quartet"") is the Dean of Admissions, dangling that possible promotion over our heroine's head.
  * Gloria Reuben (""Lincoln"") as an admissions officer...she's a paragon, practically perfect in every way. She is our heroine's main competition for that promotion.
  *Michael Sheen (""Frost Nixon"") is that 10-year live-in lover. He bails in the first few scenes, so he had very little to do other than treat her like a pet puppy.

This goofy little bit of social commentary is directed by Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") so you can expect a better than average comedy, no sweaty bodies, love-making only alluded to, no gunshots (Lily Tomlin never fires that gun), and absolutely no blowie uppie stuff.

Be prepared for an unexpected twist or two and a pleasant time. Pop some popcorn and enjoy the DVD from Amazon. It will be released soon...",1363996800,3,1678,4.831578947368421
5713586,3,B00CC34978,"Admission is a new romantic comedy featuring two seriously successful comedic actors, Tina Fey and Paul Rudd.  Both are extremely likeable in most everything they are in, and are usually very funny.  In this instance, while they each have moments of laughter, it was lighter on the humor than I expected, and heavier on the weighty emotion.  This caught me by surprise.

Tina Fey works in the Admissions department of Princeton University, and leads a very settled existence, even carries on a boring relationship, and is content.  Paul Rudd is a globe-trotting do-gooder (think a one man Peace Corps) who runs a school for now, but can't seem to stay in one place for long.  When Rudd contacts Tina Fey regarding an exceptional student, each of their lives become more complicated.  And humor, but not quite hilarity, ensues.

I don't have a huge issue with the fact that I feel like I've seen the storyline before, but with slight alterations.... I expect that in a Rom-Com.  My problem is that I've seen it done much better.  While both Fey and Rudd are likeable, they seem to have little chemistry together.  And there just weren't enough laughs to meet my expectations.  Having said that, Lily Tomlin, who plays Tina's mother, is a force of comedy in this film.

I also found the ending unsatisfying.  Nice enough, but over the course of many Rom-Coms, I expect more.  If you want a little more drama in your comedy, maybe this is for you.  While I liked it, it would definitely be a rental, and not a full-on purchase.",1363824000,30,1524,4.694339622641509

5713593,5,B00CC34978,"The amusing Admission is the first successful comedy of the year and a reasonable look at the admission process for an elite college--Princeton.
Tina Fey as Portia and Paul Rudd as John turn in pleasant performances as an admissions executive and a progressive school teacher respectively. Rudd is amiable here and usually successful in his film career, while Fey's efforts up to now have been mediocre (Date Night, Baby Mama).
As an Alumni Admissions interviewer for over 30 years at Georgetown University, I find much of the story ringing true from the overachieving candidates nurtured by ambitious parents to the underachieving but brilliant and risky individualists. Portia must struggle with the boxed-in role of continuing the Princeton tradition (read stereotypes) or breaking away to push for a student who calls himself an ""autodidact"" with low grades but perfect scores on achievement tests for courses he never took.
Amid the plot's fierce applicant battle for a slot, Portia and John dance to the usual romantic formula of disliking each other to . . . Well, you know the drill. However, it's their reactions to the admission process that provide the authentic tension as he has developed students with independent minds, and she is used to the cookie-cutter candidates who lack the passion of those independents.
Director Paul Weitz knows something about family dynamics and children with his About a Boy, In Good Company, and Little Fockers among the more obvious examples. Signing up Lily Tomlin to play Portia's feminist mom was inspired; like the ubiquitous aging Alan Arkin, Tomlin should now have plenty of work.
Admission requires no small amount of sympathy for the messy business of growing up and getting ahead-Weitz navigates the vagaries of family ambition well. If the double-meaning of the title seems too precious to you, don't worry, the rest of the story is almost unambiguous.
Although Admission is mostly about applicants to an upper-tier college, it also poses the unethical means some might employ to gain entrance. Even Portia is not blameless, a touch I found in the film's favor while it deals with the unreal segment of our population smart enough to be considered for admission.",1474243200,,2218,5.146814404432133

5713643,1,B00CC34978,"On paper, a movie starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, two of the most likable figures in Hollywood, cannot miss. Yet on paper Admission is also garbage no matter who winds up delivering the lines, as a mediocre script creates a massive conflict of interest and then refuses to acknowledge it. Princeton admissions officer Portia has hit a rut. There is minimal excitement in her relationship with Mark, and sixteen years on the job results in her spilling the same shtick to prospective students: that there is no secret to getting into Princeton and it is important for people to be themselves and blah blah blah. At an unconventional New Hampshire school, however, the students reject Portia's pitch. They want to change the world and question the notion of needing what they see as an elitist, antiquated institution to do so. Only one, Jeremiah wants to learn more. And John, who teaches classes including ""third-world development"" at the school, repeatedly insists that Portia should really get to know this kid.

Why? Because John believes that Jeremiah may be the son Portia gave up for adoption nearly two decades ago. Obviously, that represents a large bomb drop into this woman's life, but John, who frequently travels around the world doing good and adopted his Ugandan son Nelson when the boy was two and his mom and uncle died in a car crash, merely wants to look out for the interests of a promising child who has expressed interest in meeting his birth parents. Perhaps the plotline could explore the unexpected intersection of past and present in a rewarding way. The problem is that John simultaneously wants Portia to consider Jeremiah for Princeton, despite the fact that he has terrible grades, minimal extra-curriculars and, seemingly, a never-diagnosed case of Asperger's. And, oh yeah, that whole thing about Jeremiah potentially being her son.

To an extent, the immediately tiresome Admission attempts to question the college admissions process and recognize that people are much more that they may seem when they are reduced to numbers and activities. However, there is not only no doubt that Jeremiah's credentials do not qualify him for an Ivy League school that receives more than 26,000 applications and accepts approximately 1,300, but Portia's undisclosed personal involvement in a candidate clearly counts as a ground for dismissal. This woman is competing for a promotion, yet her on-the-job performance could not be less professional. In one particularly absurd scene, Portia goes to check on Jeremiah during a college party he attends and asks if he needs a toothbrush. Instead of being embarrassed, he follows her out of the party to say that he does need a toothbrush and wants to accompany her to the store to buy one. As surely all high school kids would do while enjoying their first college bash.

To be fair, Mark leaves the increasingly spiraling Portia for a snooty Virginia Woolf scholar, and confronting a child given up for adoption cannot be an easy thing to handle. Still, Fey fails to redeem Portia's flailing behavior while creating a character that merely recalls a watered-down version of Fey's fantastic and influential Liz Lemon on 30 Rock. Like Liz, Portia struggles to keep her life in order, feels awkward around kids and hates Valentine's Day. Unlike Liz, Portia's challenges are neither funny nor sympathetic. Neither is Admission, which strives for laughs through Portia's mom firing a shotgun when John will not leave Portia alone and saying she wants her daughter to call her Susannah to avoid any more ""mother-daughter role playing crap.""

Rudd, meanwhile, is saddled with a part that has no truth or surprise to find. Various characters note John's reluctance to settle down and Nelson continually expresses his desire to at long last stay in the same place for a while. It takes one guess to figure out where that storyline will go. No more resonant in the uncomfortably developing relationship between Portia and John or the scholar who romances Susannah and endorses Jeremiah just because he does a weird, unsettling ventriloquism act.

It is a legitimate point that ambitious students may need an advanced education to make their idealistic dreams become a reality. Yet throughout Admission, which in book-ended by cheap voiceover, the film endorses an open-minded, complex evaluation of a person's academic and human value but makes an extremely lousy case for its characters. The lengths to which Portia goes for Jeremiah and the ultimate resolution of the maternity issue inspire frustration instead of admiration. Long before that, Portia does her possible son no favors by trying to help his and not disclosing the conflict of interest, and John pays no attention to the other students as he strives to squeeze Jeremiah into a Princeton class in which he would be almost certainly socially and academically outclassed. Just because a person possesses uncanny intelligence does not mean that he could expect admission to the Ivy League with such questionable interpersonal skills and commitment to the various demands of education. Just because two main characters are single does not mean that they have to have a romantic relationship when minimal chemistry exists between the actors or the characters themselves.

And just because a film aims for both endearing quirk and forced sentimentality does not mean that is succeeds in blending the departments, or even making each work on their own. Admission should not just have acceptance denied; its application should be shredded.",1424736000,,5552,5.115766262403528

""Admission"" was falsely advertised as a romantic comedy. ""Admission"" is more of a dramedy. They are some laughs but mostly, this movie is considered serious. Fey plays Portia Nathan, an admissions officer at Princeton. Portia thinks she has the perfect life until she reconnects with John (an old college friend) played by the charming, Paul Rudd. I also thought Michael Sheen was wonderful in this film too. Who knew he could be such a riot?! This movie is hard to review without giving away too much of the plot but Portia goes through an ""emotional odyssey"" of sorts. Portia must face her past and the decisions she made when she was young and wayward. I really like the message of this movie. Some people might find this film boring and drawn-out (some of the scenes are a little long) but I thought ""Admission"" was well-written and well-acted. Life is complicated but it's also a fun and never-ending journey. Portia learns when life throws you a curveball, you just have to face and embrace change - good or bad.

5713668,3,B00CC34978,"I think this film was advertised a little misleadingly-- and of course you expect a comedy when it involves Tina Fey and Paul Rudd.  It's not so much a comedy as it is a mixture of romance, and not-too-depressing drama.
As advertised, Tina plays the role of one of the members of the admissions committee at Princeton, and receives a call from a long-ago classmate, now running a very ""alternative"" high school and asking her to take a look at a kid he feels is very promising as a potential Princeton admission.  Tina agrees to come have a look-see, and the first bit of subtle comedy is how very different this high school is from strait-laced Princeton.  Drama and romance come in as Tina's relationship with a colleague at Princeton unexpectedly ends as he dumps her for a young attractive grad student, and on the rebound, Tina unexpectedly finds herself somewhat attracted to Rudd, who runs this high school.

The kid doesn't have the kind of scholastic scores or pedigree that would usually be considered a great Princeton candidate, but Rudd has his own reasons for insisting Tina go to bat for him, and eventually she does.

The story has several ups and downs and turns of plot, but ends up on a reasonably upbeat note, with the unoriginal message that no matter how carefully you think you have life planned out, there are always surprises in store to disrupt your plans.

Tina and Paul didn't quite seem to make one of film history's most-famous romantic pairs (not as awkward as Murray and Weaver in Ghostbusters, at least).  There's no nudity or vulgarity or violence; for a PG-13 film nowadays it's pretty tame.

I find writing reviews for movies and books challenging because I don't want to give any spoilers but it was a movie about people who were emotional stunted, selfish, and way to many over the top family issues.  The thing is the story wasn't deep enough to be moving and make me care about their problems. Nor was it endearing or funny so again I didn't care when these people had problems.  So instead it was a movie that didn't make me laugh and only made me annoyed at how obnoxious all the characters were.  All in All I did not like it.",1397606400,2,738,4.280575539568345

5713716,1,B00CC34978,"Tina Fey is one of those actresses who knows how to write funny.  She has a gift that doesnt go unnoticed.  What makes her even more impressive is that her knack for delivering the funny that she writes makes it all the morefunny.  Paul Rudd is one of those charming actors who doesnt have the fan base he deserves.  He drips everyman charm in a way that someone like George Clooney could only dream of.  Instead of appearing manufactured, he just is.  On top of that charm (awkward charm even) is a sense of humor that carries his performances to another level entirely.  Hes hilarious.

When Admission was released earlier this year, I was stoked.  I love both Fey and Rudd and the idea of them working together in a dramedy seemed very appropriate and ripe with potential.

Sadly, every ounce of that potential is squandered.

The problem with Admission is that the film is just so dull.  It never really goes much of anywhere, and the charm is lost in characters and situations that feel stale on contact.  The basic plot follows a Princeton admissions officer who has her mundane life flipped upside down when she is accosted by the head of a new alternative school who feels that one of his students is her long lost son (the one she gave up for adoption that no one knows about).  She is threatened by this, and he is relentless, and soon she is roped into this game of ethics as she tries to cheat her own system in order to get this kid acceptance into Princeton.

I don't think that Admission knows what kind of film it wants to be.  I suppose it is trying to be a dramedy in the vein of The Family Stone except it never understands how to handle its more serious issues in a way that feel relatable or even interesting.  Instead, it plods along at a depressed pace with performances that lack spark (everyone feels so sad) and then you have Lily Tomlin in an embarrassingly clichd return to the screen.  It also happens to be one of those films that tries too hard to produce a twist, to the point where the ending feels even more contrived than it would have had they gone the expected sentimental route.

I wonder why it is that films like this exist, because its not good enough or bad enough to be remembered.  Its just so bland and uninspired that it is easily forgotten and pretty much worthless.

Its not even fun to make fun of, because there is nothing here to talk about.",1386028800,,2392,4.415525114155251

5713737,5,B00CC34978,"Tina Fey and Paul Rudd are among my favorite comedians working today.  Their teaming in ""Admission"" not only met but exceeded my expectations.  I think a lot of the ambivalence towards the film is that it cannot easily be labeled comedy or drama.  I call it life.  The film is more of a vehicle for Fey with Rudd offering able support.  Fey plays Portia a Princeton admissions officer at life's crossroads.  Basically she is a cog in a machine that manufactures prestige but feels personally empowered because she holds the rubber stamp.  Rudd plays John a teacher at an alternative school who brings to Portia's attention an unconventional student of his who on the surface isn't Princeton material but brings to the table something other applicants can't offer.  John also intimates that the student may be the son she gave up for adoption eighteen years before.  The maternal feelings that are lit in Portia may be influencing her decision making process as to whether John's student is worthy of consideration ergo the double meaning of the film's title.  ""Admission"" is a freshly original film that offers a lot of food for thought.  It's a smart film that assumes the intelligence of its audience.  I was surprised that the curators of Princeton allowed filming there considering how critical the filmmakers view their admissions process.  The film is impeccably cast with good supporting turns by Wallace Shawn, Gloria Reuben and especially Lily Tomlin who plays Portia's feminist mother.  The film was met with mixed to negative reaction when released in the Spring but by my account that's probably due to dashed expectations.",1383350400,2,1635,5.007407407407407

Other than writing Mean Girls, on the big screen I feel she hasn't yet hit a double or a triple let alone a home run with her acting.

Paying close attention we may also learn ourselves about family and possibly life in general.  However it is not really worth the effort of going through the movie.  There is nothing really negative but on the other hand there is nothing.",1380758400,,588,4.938775510204081

5713775,5,B00CC34978,"This was a cute romantic-comedy/drama centered around a Princeton admissions officer and her personal life, the irony of course being that the students she was judging for admissions had their lives ""figured out"", and Tina Fey's character did not.  In short (sans spoilers), Porsche (Fey) has been working at the same job for sixteen years, has had a live-in boyfriend for ten, and seems to be stuck in a rut when a teacher running a developmental school (Rudd) and his star pupil Jeremiah inadvertently intervene.

Without the admissions-officer backstory, I have to admit that this movie probably would have read like any other generic rom-com.  However, the acting was superb, as Rudd and Fey had great on-screen chemistry that was believable--heartwarming at times and awkward at others.  Lily Tomlin as Porsche's hardcore-feminist mother was a great choice, as her character was integral in understanding Porsche.

Overall, this was a nice sort-of feel-good story with an indie feel; Fey's Porsche is relatable and so true-to-life in the scenarios she faces and how she deals with them.  This isn't a Bridesmaids-type comedy filled with nonstop punchlines, but it's a cute story with a lot of heart and the type of comedy you find in real life. A definite gem.",1380672000,2,1265,5.086956521739131
5713776,2,B00CC34978,"the story and the Tina Fey character ridicule pushy parents trying to get their kids into the Ivy League school, only to have the Tina Fey character become a pushy parent herself when she mistakenly believes a teenager trying for admission is the son she gave up years ago for adoption. Story attempts an emotionally unengaging proof - that parents love their children (weak theme), that they should back off and not micromanage regarding higher education, and that the kids will likely be fine. First, who's the target audience? I guess filmmakers were going after parents but the screenplay was too poorly structured to be effective. Well-heeled pushy parents are unlikely to be looking for vindication in film, especially one in which they're being ridiculed.  And slacker parents won't self-identify as such, even when it's true. So no audience.  Second, with the world economy on the brink of a meltdown parents have every reason to push as hard as they can to get their kids into the best schools available so the kid might actually obtain a marketable degree upon graduation and be able to find a job.  I don't know when this screenplay was written but it didn't take into account the economic realities of today, which makes sense as films are greenlit sometimes years before being filmed; perhaps there were insufficient funds for a re-write. The actors were fine; the screenplay though had nothing useful to say, and in fact is untrue given that we're in a world recession where an education promoting pushy parent is a practical realist.

This writer wouldn't even throw us a bone. All these little story threads and no feel good moments from any of them. I felt like the skinny dogs in the show, searching for scraps.
I like awkward humor but the awkward scenes were just awkward. I wanted to fast forward through them just to get them over with.

5713846,4,B00CC34978,"Attempting to categorize this smart film as a comedy, a romance, a drama or whatever label people are trying to place on it is much the same as trying to label Life. The core story is a study of parent child relationships and the scars that can be easily seen despite veneer of just making the best of everything that comes our way. In the end it is a very tender film as written by Karen Croner based on the novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz and directed with skill by Paul Weitz, even though there are moments of injected silly misfired attempts at raucous humor that could well be left on the cutting room floor. Much of the success of the film is due to the fine performances by Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Lily Tomlin, Michael Sheen, Gloria Reuben, and Wallace Shawn as well as newcomers Nat Wolff and Travaris Spears.

The story can be too quickly summarized as follows: Straitlaced Princeton University admissions officer Portia Nathan (Tina Fey), cohabiting with Chaucer-spouting boyfriend Mark (Michael Sheen) is caught off-guard when she makes a recruiting visit to an alternative high school overseen by her former college classmate, the freewheeling John Pressman (Paul Rudd) who has adopted a young lad from Africa (Travaris Spears). Pressman has surmised that Jeremiah (Nat Wolff), his gifted yet very unconventional student, might well be the son that Portia secretly gave up for adoption 18 years ago. Portia, the lovechild of kooky Susannah (Lily Tomlin), finds herself bending the rules for Jeremiah, putting at risk the life she thought she always wanted -winning admissions director at Princeton where the current director (Wally Shawn) is deciding between Portia and her co-worker Corrine (Gloria Reuben)- but in the process finding her way to a surprising and exhilarating life and romance she never dreamed of having.

Where this film shines is not opting for the easy `perfect endings' and it is a much stronger and more meaningful film for that. It could use some editing for some of the silliness that contaminates an otherwise very smart and tender story about how we eventually become `adults'.  Despite its flaws this is a film very much worth sharing. Grady Harp, September 13",1378166400,2,2194,4.924324324324324

While the actors in this film may have done roles in past movies which deliver non-stop laughs and silliness, Focus Films should be your signal they will not be playing inside their expected roles.  With that said, I was impressed with Tina Fey's ability to perform such an intricate character who goes through some massive internal challenges and changes.  I was moved by all the dynamic characters, and I felt the story line to be unique and genuine.  I will be chewing this one in my mind for awhile which means it was well worth my time to watch.

Um, there are many more ""women over 35"" movies out there now that women are marrying and having kids later in life due to focusing on their careers - the ""chick flick"" is changing to reflect that, especially the older generations' lag in realizing this. This was not one of the funnier ""aging women"" (to quote another reviewer) movies (like Bridesmaids, Friends with Kids, Sex and the City dynasty).  Women are peaking later and ""getting married"" is no longer the definition of happiness - or goal of every movie.  Editorial aside, back to the review:

This was a rom-com in the background of a story where a woman deals with whether or not she has the ""mother"" gene.  Her mother, played by Lily Tomlin, was not a good mother, which made Tina Fey avoid motherhood at all costs, including the cost of herself, which she rediscovers in the end, along with a deeper relationship with her own mother.

IN SHORT: This movie was subtle, rarely if ever laugh-out-loud, and lacked chemistry between Rudd and Fey. It lacked magic over all, and as a fan of Fey and Rudd, I am very sorry to have to say that.

Portia Nathan (Fey) is an admissions officer at Princeton who we find out, gave up a baby boy  for adoption 18 years earlier.  Rudd plays John Pressman, the son of wealth who gave it up to ""do good"" all over the world.  Currently he's running an alternative-styled school in a rural part of the state.  You know the kind, where they birth cows.  One of John's more interesting students is Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) and he just might be interested in applying to Princeton.

John suggests that Portia visit his school and sets up a meeting with Jeremiah.  We know early on that John suspects that Jeremiah's birth mother is Portia.  That's pretty much it.  Portia has a boyfriend (Michael Sheen) she lives with, but we know right off the bat that something will go wrong there.  How else will she end up with John?  Portia also has a hippie/wacko mother (Lily Tomlin in the role Jane Fonda usually plays of late).  She also battles with a peer (Gloria Reuben) for the position that the Dean of Admissions (Wallace Shawn) is about to vacate.

There are a few chuckles, but certainly not enough with these 2 talented leads.  This is a poorly written adaptation of Jean Hanff Korelitz's novel and the direction is a miss as well.

The Blu ray version I watch was in 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It look very good.  Colors were strong, the clarity was excellent with a bit of grain.  I could seen nothing to complain about. The audio likewise is very good with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.

If this is supposed to be a comedy, it lacks funny moments.  If it's supposed to be a romance, it lacks romantic tension.  If it's supposed to be a drama, it's not very believable.  It almost feels like it's a first draft of a script that needs work before it's filmed.

Looking at the cast list may give you high hopes.  Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Lily Tomlin, and Wallace Shawn (the ""inconceivable"" guy from Princess Bride).  But unfortunately, even the best actor can only do so much with a flimsy script.

  The plot needs at least 4 hours to develop itself. The characters have no substance, and the setting is low budget.
  The chemistry between Tina Fay and man friend is non-existent.  They may as well be friends..even that was lacking.
Lily Tomlin is her usual sarcastic dry dull self, more pathetic here. WHy did they make this movie? So many loose ends..it would take a life-time
to figure it out.. and who wants to anyway at this point..

It's as if they expected that simply putting the likeable Rudd and adorable Tina Fey into a framework of endless dull repartee would be enough to put women (who are clearly the target demographic) in the seats.  It's as if they think they had the cipher to make those in possession of vaginas clap with giddiness.  They didn't. They forgot women have brains, and the ability to discern...which is why this film failed at the box office.

If you want to see Rudd in fine form, rent Wanderlust.  I'm personally still waiting for a vehicle worthy of Tina Fey's talent, as this film certainly isn't.

She had a great job, a wonderful boyfriend and just when she felt everything was perfect, Porcia realized her life was built on a house of cards.  The movie represents how we sometimes make choices in our life based on the desire to please somebody else.  After everything she had worked so hard for came crushing down on her, Porcia decided to embrace a life of her own.  Lilly Tomlin plays Porcia's mother, a crusty old hermit of a woman who couldn't eek out the slightest bit of affection for her daugher when she needed it most. The movie moves a bit slow in the beginning, but blossoms into this beautiful love story between Porcia and the teacher of her prodigy star student she hoped to get admitted into Princeton.  If opposites attract, it is surely true in this movie.  More of a romantic themed story with subtle comedy, well worth a watch.  You will laugh a bit and shed a tear at the end.

This movie falls into that category. If you didn't already know, any movie like this has the die hard fans of insert actor here that will 5 star review it and try to justify it. Also, a studio that invests money in a movie will throw a few dollars to give positive reviews just like buying Twitter followers or Facebook likes. This movie is a solid two.

Classic rom-com, I guess. Worst film genre. HOld on. I gotta puke again! Someone ask Tina Fey why she had to make this movie. Easy paycheck, I'm sure. Duh.

Chances are those of you reading this are completely oblivious as to what goes on during the acceptance process for a college. Hell, I would be lying if I said I had even the faintest idea before I sat down and watched Admission. Surprisingly, this romantic-comedy of sorts opens the door to this process. Whether or not it was their intention, one of the most fascinating things, for me, about Admission was seeing just how much work goes into accepting new students. It's more than just looking at a student's GPA or their extracurricular activities, it's deciding whether or not they would fit at the college and then making a case for that student in front of the board. With that said, for fear of loosing you with these uninteresting details, I'll continue on to the meat of the story.

Admission's story is simple, really. You follow the life of Portia Nathan (Tina Fey), an admissions officer for Princeton. At the moment she's juggling quite a few things in her life - a rocky relationship, a possible promotion in the future, and she has to go through a new batch of applications - but things are about to get even more complicated when she meets John Pressman (Paul Rudd). While they may not know each other formally, Portia and John both went to the same school together. As of now John is working at a peculiar school called Quest - where he teaches and partially looks over - and he's very excited for her to meet Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff), a boy he deems ""a prodigy"".

From this point on the movie follows Portia's quest (no pun intended) to not only discover herself, but also to help Jeremiah get into Princeton. It's one filled with laughs and a quiet tenderness, but what really pushes this movie forward is the two leads. I've developed a strong love for Paul Rudd's work and it's almost impossible to dislike Tina Fey - both as a person and as a performer - so it's no surprise that I fell in love with both of them in Admission. What makes their performances better, however, is the fact that they have great chemistry on screen. It's obvious that Rudd and Fey were meant to be in a film together and I'm curious as to why it's taken so long to do so.

What caught me off guard is the fact that they don't do much to explore the relationship between these two characters. While there's a couple of moments towards the end that indicate where their relationship is going, it kind of felt like they didn't fully utilize their chemistry. Both in the script and in the scenes, it never felt like these two were totally on the same page. They were always a joy to watch, but their characters never seemed truly connected. Does that make sense? Other than that, though, my only other complaint with the story was how it concluded. Don't get me wrong, it's not like the ending was necessarily bad, but while Admission's preceding moments were filled with passion and drive, the ending felt like it was put on cruise control. For me, it lacked focus and direction. It was just kind of there.

Finally, Admission's cast and their performances were great. Tina Fey was perfect for her part and she brought this odd humanity to a character that most incoming college students would deem as evil. Similarly, Paul Rudd was spot on as John and I can't see anyone else playing the role. Once again, Paul Rudd brought his odd charm that mixed beautifully with Fey's humanity. Along with Nat Wolf, you also get some minor appearances from Michael Sheen, Lily Tomlin, and Wallace Shawn. Everyone did a solid job and they all felt fitting for their respective roles.

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - While Admission may not be the greatest comedy to come out in the last few years, it has a lot of charm and part of that is due to the two leads. Paul Rudd and Tina Fey are always a joy to watch and when you put them together everything just feels right. Yes, Admission may loose some of its steam in its closing minutes, but it's still an enjoyable experience filled with genuine laughter and a touch of tenderness.",1374192000,,4066,4.563013698630137

Maybe my expectations for this film were just set too high, but for me and my 15 year old daughter who also watched it, it was just ""OK"" and we expected great.

As a Princeton admissions officer with no life outside of work, Tina Fey is believable. Paul Rudd as a director of a rural alternative school, is also well cast.  My favorite actor in the film is Lily Tomlin, who despite having very little on-screen time, does a great job as Fey's free-spirited mother.

The story was good enough, and if it had gotten rolling either in a funny way or a deeply heartwarming way, I would have been sold on the movie.  Unfortunately it skirted both, and never completely immersing me in an empathy for the characters or their situations. (I wish I could expand on this without giving away too much of the story, but I really don't want to ruin the movie for those who wish to see it.)

Fey and Rudd are good, but their chemistry seemed non-existent to me.  Moments that could have been hilarious, were simply cute.  There were a few 'good ones', but they seemed few and far between and left me looking for more, and not finding them.

Admission is not a bad movie, it's just mediocre.  It doesn't have violence, lots of expletives or on screen sex scenes, thus making it a suitable movie for families with tweens and teens.

1. The Editing. I usually don't complain about editing but this was horrible. Non-sequitur jokes that don't go anywhere and awkward scene shifts.
2. All the good stuff is in the trailer. So watch the trailer 5 times and save yourself the money and the obviousness of this movie.
3. Bad relationship building and non-attachment to characters.....not even the kids.
4. Camera placement mess ups all over the place making one crappy shot to the next.

This one decided to tell its story in 105 minutes. It could have done much better, and helped move things along with a bit more excitement, if it had tried to tell its story in about 85 minutes. Just WAY too much downtime. In addition, the majority of the scenes throughout the movie just seemed to lack any ""life.""
There were only three ""lights"" in this movie. Two of them were the main actors, Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, who put in incredibly impressive performances despite the really lame script they were given. The third was the ending. It's unfortunate, but the movie actually did begin to get a little interesting during the last 20 minutes, but, I suspect, a lot of viewers never made it that far. The boredom overtook them much earlier in the movie, and they never bothered to finish it.

She visits a school in New Hampshire, near where she was born, to make a presentation. Her reception was a bit unusual and at times confrontational. John Pressman (Paul Rudd) runs the school and wants one of his exceptional students, Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) to attend Princeton.

Portia's mother is played by Lily Tomlin, who I thought was dead because I don't watch a lot of TV shows. She proves to be quite the character, like something stolen from John Irving. It appears that Jeremiah may be Portia's biological son she gave up for adoption. This creates numerous humorous, ""That was weird"" moments as her life has just been turned inside out.

Perhaps the oddest thing about the film is that the writers seemed to have placed New Jersey and New Hamshire near each other as the characters are constantly and without much effort driving back and forth between the two, sometimes twice a day.

This is a romantic comedy with an emphasis on comedy. It is a feel good film, but not a tear jerker. A film Tina Fey can use on her resum.

As far as language, sex scenes, etc.....the ""F"" bomb was dropped, and a slew of other foul language. No nudity or sex scenes although sex is discussed and implied as having taken place three times in the film. Half way through the film I realized that I was watching the clock wishing the movie was over. It was not engaging, nothing about it kept my interest, and I felt nothing towards the characters. It was a waste of $5.00 to rent.",1373328000,4,914,4.71875

I found it funny and very moving. The film was marketed all wrong like it was a comedy but it was much more than that.  I think the male dominated critics really gave it a hard time or had the total wrong idea of what the film was when they sat down to review it. It's really an indy film. I truly believe it will have a bigger life on DVD and on pay cable has people discover it's quirky charm.  See this film. It's delightful.,1373328000,33,577,4.133928571428571

5714156,1,B00CC34978,"This movie has a couple of my favorite stars in it. Lily Tomlin is a talented actress (vide her role in The West Wing) as well as a superb comedian.

Paul Rudd is a cuddly and adorable love interest, as I fondly recall from Clueless and Friends.

The book on which the movie is based is an utterly excellent tour de force of superb writing.

So why was this movie a failure?

There are several reasons.  For one, the plot bears little resemblance to the plot of the book.  The book was excellent, but its plot was not particularly adaptable into a movie, because plot is not really what the book is about in the first place.

For another, the book, while not tragic, is not remotely funny or comedic, and could not have been intended to be.  The heroine's mother in the book is both charmless and damaging; her idiosyncrasies (to use too trivial a word) cause pain to those around her.  There is nothing funny about her.  Nor is there anything funny about the heroine's life, either the events that befall her in the novel or that happened before the book opened.  How anyone imagined that the book could be turned into a comedy--or even a movie with comedic moments--is beyond me.  The book is a comedy in the technical sense that a blossoming romance is involved, but not in any other way.

No wonder so many of the reviews described this movie as schizophrenic.  It could not have been anything else, once Hollywood decided it had to be funny.

My advice is:  skip the movie.  Buy the book instead.  It is a work of art.",1368748800,3,1523,4.41726618705036

Attempts at humor fell flat. Some scenes were weird & uncomfortable like the daughter hating her mother, the man & woman having sex with a 6th grader in the house (who ends up sleeping on the sofa...why ? did he not want to be in his bedroom hearing his dad having sex ?). Admissions officer sneaks in & changes who will get an entrance invitation, knowing she will lose her job. You get the idea that she does it out of a sense of guilt, that she feels like she ""owes"" the kid .The characters were a real disappointment all the way around. The end was supposed to be tidy & happy, but really, it felt like a farce. Woman knows the kid so little, that she actually has no idea if he will be OK in Princeton. Genius that can't thrive in a normal high school environment doesn't translate to success  in a college structured environment.
