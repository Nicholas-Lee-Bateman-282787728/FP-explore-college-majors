6658873,4,B00NJ4RGFG,"Excellent characterization, acting, writing. I would like it to lighten up a bit; the stories tend to be melodramatic.  I especially think Taylor Kinney (Severide) is Emmy-award material for his role as is Monica Raymund for hers.",1412380800,2,230,5.216216216216216

6658914,4,B00NJ4RGFG,"I sporadically watched this on TV in real time. Now I'm hooked on seasons 1-3. And since I finished season 3, I'll order other seasons.

Firefighters and paramedics are brave- this is a given. They need to know the chemistry of a fire and be mechanical IE to  un-do elevators, vehicles, helicopters, machinery, fences etc to rescue a victim. This show has heart and demonstrates how firefighters & paramedics must
'think on their feet.' These folks live at the firehouse while on duty ( 24 hours on & 48 hours off) and must tolerate each others quirks, food preferences, and so on. Herrmann, Cruz, ""Otis"" &  ""Mouch"" add some  humor, as do other characters.

On a sad note, one of the main characters dies early on (this season), in the line of duty & this impacts all in the firehouse. Dawson did not have an easy transition from paramedic to firefighter ( seasons 2 &3) and some of her closest relationships suffered as a consequence.",1524960000,,935,4.642424242424243

6658973,4,B00NJ4RGFG,"I like this show and am on my second time throught the series. But one thing in particular grates on me. The relationship between the PC and Garrett is always always argumentative to the point of anger. It is just too unrealistic. In the real world, in a working relationship that acrimonious, one of the two would be gone after about two sessions like they have. Whats wrong with having a little more harmony and subtlety?",1510876800,,423,4.578947368421052

The young lady of color front center of the DVD box cover (don't know her name) used to be in the series Lie To Me and we all loved that show.  So when Chicago Fire first came on and my son saw her he went bonkers.  I don't get to watch this show as my son does but I get to catch some of it before dinner or early in the morning with him as he streams it on HULU.

6659851,5,B00NJ4RGFG,"The third season of this intense, brilliantly written and acted show continues as strong as its predecessors, kicking off with the aftermath of Shay's (Lauren German)'s tragic death at the end of Season 2. Naturally, all of Firehouse 51 is deeply affected, but no one like Severide (Taylor Kinney) who can barely function. It doesn't help matters that Shay's replacement, Brett (Kara Kilmer) bears a hauntingly similar physical resemblance with her slight build and blonde hair.

Meanwhile, Dawson (Monica Raymund) and Casey (Jesse Spencer) are trying their best to balance their personal relationship with working together as firefighters; Boden (Eamonn Walker) welcomes a new baby into the world while reeling from news about his father; Mills (Charlie Barnett) anguishes over his forced switch to ambulance while digging into buried family history; Herrmann (David Eigenberg), Otis (Yuri Sardarov), Mouch (Christian Stolte) and Cruz (Joe Minoso) are full of still more schemes for expanding business at Molly's.

Episode 19 involves a crisis at Chicago Med, focusing heavily on several of its staff members - chiefly Dr. Will Halstead (Nick Gehlfuss), who is also the brother of Jay Halstead on Chicago PD, and April Sexton (Yaya Dacosta), a nurse who went to high school with Severide - in hopes of creating interest for a spinoff.

As a special bonus, there are two triple crossovers (with Chicago PD and Law & Order: SVU), one in November and one in April. There are also frequent cameos by various Chicago PD characters, most often Lindsay (Sophia Bush), Dawson (Jon Seda), Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger) and Platt (Amy Morton).

As always, the stories are well-written and acted, keeping viewers' interest til the very end and leaving them curious for the next episodes! If the show keeps at its current pace, there should be room for many more seasons to come.",1429056000,,1896,5.166123778501628

Finally one day I was going through my Amazon Instant Video and saw Chicago Fire Season 1 and thought what the heck let me give this a try (this was three weeks ago).  Well I began watching the premier episode in Season 1 and was hooked from that moment on.  I watched all 3 seasons (up to this week) and I am blown away by how great a show it is.  The character development is flawless.  The story lines are accurate and pretty true to reality.  The show has adventure, drama, comedy, sadness all rolled up into one show.  I highly recommend this show.  You will not be sorry.",1425945600,,694,4.359375

6659924,5,B00NJ4RGFG,One of the best shows on local channels and I watch very few. Channel nine and the Canadian channels are also viewed with  frequency. I abhor the mind-numbing reality shows; the never ending shows with violence when we have but to venture into the daily news of the reality of where this country is headed. I prefer to expand my mind by picking up a book. But I digress. I like the characters that bring life to the show Chicago Fire. I especially like Kelly who lost who I think was the love of his life (although she was gay). He has the look of still being in pain over that loss and I hope that sometime in the series he can find someone worthy of the love and respect he deserves. He loved Shay for who she was - even though she could not return it as he might have wished.,1424563200,9,778,4.118421052631579

6659947,3,B00NJ4RGFG,"Let me start by saying I like the show , however the writers seem to forget some of the back stories. They don't follow through with story lines. They sometimes jump forward weeks or months after something major.  I want to see the episode right after something exciting(for instance Caseys recovering from the injury last year ) Casey was severely injured last year, a few episodes about brain injury and then no mention this whole season.  It was suppose to be life threatening if he got injured again.  What about truck crash? .  I think it was a big mistake to kill Shay and I will stop watching if Mills and Dawson get back together.  Mills seems to have a lot of the major stories. When did it become the Dawson and MIlls show.  I would rather they concentrate on Casey and Severide.  They are the main stars of the program.  It use to be a must see for me. I hope the rest of the season is better and less of the Dawson and Mills show.",1420761600,12,942,4.2824858757062145
