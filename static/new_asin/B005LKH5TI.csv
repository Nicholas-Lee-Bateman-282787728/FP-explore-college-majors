4829195,4,B005LKH5TI,"I had no idea what to expect when I went to see this film, but I was delighted that I was privileged to see it. The acting was quite good and the story line was captivating. I am looking forward to watching it again. Well worth the time spent. Different from most of what is out there.",1409184000,,285,4.017543859649122
4829196,5,B005LKH5TI,"Great to see that it will be released in the US, could watch the Australian version only on PC. This is a wonderful Roadmovie starring the amazing singer/songwriter/actress Dilana Robichaux. I love the songs sometimes sentimental sometimes a little heavier, I hope a soundtrack on CD will follow as well. A must have for any fan of handmade music!!! Dilana's voice is OVER THE TOP!!!",1409184000,,383,4.907692307692308
4829197,5,B005LKH5TI,"I was offered the role of  Dilana's mother in this film which I accepted without hesitation. Not because I was to play opposite James Brolin (hey, I might get to meet Barbara Streisand) but because it gave me a chance to work with Angel Camouflage's director, Michael Givens whose cinematic skills and directorial eye I regard very highly. The script, storyline and believability of the characters, especially Dilana made me very excited to be considered. So amidst speedy negotiations with the film's producers to tie in my newly recorded original remake of my classic hit Black Velvet to the film's soundtrack album I was flown to Charleston, South Carolina preparing to jump into a chilly pool in November for one of my scenes. My physical health at the time prevented the film's insurance company from employing any potential risks and to my disappointment, I was on the next plane home. It was a very difficult decision for everyone involved, requiring professional decorum, but I was reminded why I'd chosen music to showcase my talents to the world instead of film. However, my birds eye view gave me the chance to see the magnificent Pirates of the Caribbean-styled set, sort through wardrobe of an ex-rock star and meet the crew, Michael and his lovely family. The end result is an honest film that features a wide cross section of mega-talent starring in a beautifully shot movie that will stand the test of time!

4829198,5,B005LKH5TI,"This movie is packed full of surprises with drama as well as comedy throughout. Dilana does an excellent job in her first acting job starring as Scottie, with James Brolin as her costar. One of the best things about this movie is it's sound track. Dilana has an AWESOME voice and Patty Smyth, Marshall Tucker Band and Kurtis Blow add to it as well. This film has one numerous awards at several festivals including Best Actress (2x) for Dilana and also Best Music (9 Dilana originals). Definitely worth buying!",1409184000,2,509,4.730337078651686

8478241,5,B005LKH5TI,"I love Dilana so I knew right from the start that I would love the music. I was very happy that I loved the movie too. I read a bad review saying it was a 'sappy' movie. Probably that reviever would've liked it if there was nudity, explicit sex, and gory violence. This movie has a good story to tell and thankfully doesn't use any of the above mentioned descriptions. If you like a movie with an actual story and great music of several genres, I highly recommend this one.",1464825600,,473,4.266666666666667
8478242,5,B005LKH5TI,"The is a fun movie with outstanding music. If you've not listened to Dilana then you need to.
The story is a good one and the story is entertaining.",1459382400,,148,4.137931034482759
8478243,2,B005LKH5TI,I love Dilanas music. But the movie was okay...not a movie to pause to use the Lou. I do wish there was a soundtrack for it. But if you are looking for acting don't bother!!!,1438128000,,174,4.0
8478244,5,B005LKH5TI,"Everyone had such a great time while being on set  making this movie !! I happen to be one  working on Angel Camouflaged and remembering everyone  having a great time, And of course Dilana Robichaux was super working with and not to mention her talents and music performed throughout the movie!!",1436918400,,295,4.745098039215686
8478245,5,B005LKH5TI,"Angel Camouflaged starring James Brolin, Patty Smyth and South African rocker Dilana (who appeared on the competition television series Rock Star Supernova) is a tale about a South African Rock star named Scotty B whose fast-paced lifestyle crashes one night, just as it seems her career is about to take flight. Later Scotty B. finds redemption and rediscovers her love of music after she inherits her aunt's dockside club.

Dilana was a natural fit for ""Angel Camouflaged"" (Directed by: R. Michael Givens). One of the joys of the movie is discovering her unique voice another is the beautiful ocean side scenery of the South Carolina coast.",1429920000,2,642,5.056603773584905
8478246,5,B005LKH5TI,"Dilana is so passionate about her work and it really shows in this film. Being her first real acting experience, she gives an absolutely amazing performance. I loved the relationship she had with James Brolin's character and overall a great movie. Great music too!",1424995200,,264,5.0227272727272725

8478248,5,B005LKH5TI,Great cinematography and good music. I enjoyed this movie!,1423872000,,58,5.555555555555555
8478249,2,B005LKH5TI,"Pretty disappointed. Cheesy is a good word for this. Dilana was my number one pick on Rockstar Supernova, so I have been following her a little bit to see what she does. I don't see what other reviewers saw in her acting. I think she should stick to the music business. There were moments when she shined and there were moments when she fell flat on her face, in my opinion. The intro to the movie with her in front of the mirror was great. The parts where she is trying to shed some tears, was not. The movie in general could of pressed for three stars. Would of been better If the movie was geared more towards the teenage bracket.
Diana has a great voice and is obviously a great performer judging from the old show. There just was little bit and pieces of that throughout the movie, not enough, maybe. The bar scenes were predictable and hardly believable. Too bad, I think this could of been a stronger movie, great idea, just missed its mark. My DVD played fine, by the way, here in the states.",1421798400,,1000,4.324468085106383
