I would LOVE to see this workout re-released on DVD. I would buy it in a heartbeat if they did. We still have the VHS tape but, alas, we moved to DVD (then later Blu-Ray) when our last VCR bit the dust. Would love to be able to use this particular workout again- especially since I've let things slide just a bit. LOL!",1490832000,,511,4.12

8214878,5,630098933X,"I've had many exercise tapes over the years but must say that this Low Impact Aerobics tape, using the medicine ball, is the most effective. What is especially great about the tape is the warm up and cool down. Even if I couldn't do the tape one morning, I could always do the warm up and cool down, stretching exercises. It helped make my body limber and I felt so much more energized after doing the warm up and cool down. Every other day, I would follow the whole program. Within 6 weeks, I felt more toned and noticed I could notch my belt a little tighter. I still have the VHS tape, but I want to have it converted to a DVD so that I can go back to this energizing program on a regular basis. My VHS tape recorder is long gone ... sob.",1351555200,,741,4.082191780821918
8214879,5,630098933X,"This video is excellent if you are a beginner. It lasts about 30 minutes and it contains warm up, low impact aerobics and cool down so is a complete and safe workout. I used this video for about 7 months until I felt it was safe to move to harder aerobics. You can still use this workout video when you are in the mood for a light workout, like I do sometimes.",1143676800,2,360,4.013888888888889
