6356765,1,B00JGTSWBK,"Does not work in my Blu-ray player. My husband seems to think because the disc is from the U.K., it is not compatible with our Blu-ray player. Whatever the reason, there is a note that reads, ""This disc will not play due to the region code settings of the player"".",1500336000,2,264,4.3
6356766,1,B00JGTSWBK,"This doesn't play on standard DVD players in USA which I just noticed on the item description after ordering, receiving, and my toddler being disappointed when we couldn't watch it on our blue ray player. I have never had this issue with a blue ray purchased. Why didn't I check the product features and description you ask? Because it's a blue ray disk of a movie I've seen since childhood. I never would have thought to check the description when all pertinent information was on the title, or so I thought. So I give this 1 star because something as important as having a different region and not playing on standard blue ray players purchased in the country I live in, is something that should be on the title of the item not ""hidden"" in the description.",1500336000,2,758,4.54014598540146

8650722,1,B00JGTSWBK,"This arrived just in time for Christmas, so I wrapped it, knowing my daughter would be super excited because she had been asking about this movie for a while. Well, she opened it, we put it in the Blu-Ray player (actually a PS3 cuz it plays DVDs and Blu-Rays), and it WOULD NOT PLAY. I contacted these people immediately and told them I had received a defective disc, but they said in their description that this DVD only plays in a multi-region player which I have never even heard of. Do not buy this if you live in the USA. Apparently we don't have the right kind of players...",1524441600,4,580,4.330275229357798
