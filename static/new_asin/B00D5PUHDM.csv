8589742,5,B00D5PUHDM,"First off, this set works great on a North American PS3 Slim. If you're getting this set, you're probably a Hitchcock fan micromanaging for the best Blu Rays for the least cash. If this doesn't describe you, it still makes sense with the caveats mentioned below. In any case, by the time you're slightly familiar with each movie, the lack of titles on the discs won't be a big issue for you.

The menus entirely made of symbols never was a problem for me either, and a small price to pay for getting this set for 20 bucks. They are very intuitive, standard Blu Ray menus, and won't throw you off if you're comfortable operating a Blu Ray player. This half simply is (save for Vertigo), the stronger part of the larger Masterpiece Collection. With all due respect to the Birds, in my humble opinion, if you buy this set, then Vertigo, then the triple set (from Warner) with North by Northwest/Strangers on a Train/Dial M for Murder, you've got all his really excellent works on Blu Ray for around 50 or 60 bucks.

But it's definitely a good idea to compare it with the 14 or 15 disc collections - this set makes a lot of sense at the 20 bucks I paid for it - at 30 you might want to think more carefully and compare it to the larger region free sets.

So many Hitchcocks, so little time!",1484524800,,1286,4.327800829875518
8589743,2,B00D5PUHDM,"I was very disappointed with the way these Blu-rays were created. The quality is fine, but they're designed for an international audience (non-English speaking) so there are no words or titles anywhere on the disks nor the root menus. just icons, which I found offputting. it took a long time for me to even figure out which movie might be on which disc.",1424736000,6,354,4.634920634920635
8589744,5,B00D5PUHDM,"1948's Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE is a thoroughly enthralling and disturbing look at a thrill killing perpetrated by two prep-school chums (John Dall and Farley Granger) possibly suggested subconsciously by their unwitting professor (James Stewart). This film has often been characterized notably only as Hitchcock's great experiment. He shot it in ten-minute takes contrary to his stylistic use of effective story telling through editing. This was a technique that he also employed to a lesser degree in 1949's UNDER CAPRICORN. However, ROPE is first and foremost a riveting tale bordering on the perverse. The use of color as the clouds turn red as sunset sets upon the city as prominently seen through the drawing room windows is riveting. There is blood on the hands of this duo but just maybe Stewart unwittingly fed to the fuel of their perversity and their decline into human degradation. This is a disturbing tale into the darkest regions of the human psyche.

SABOTEUR is forerunner of his NORTH BY NORTHWEST in this WWII espionage tale planted on American soil. SABOTEUR is an impressive bit of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. He uses his familiar theme of the wrong man on the run from the law and implicated by those who are in fact guilty, our hero Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) must uncover the culprits before they carry out their next act of terror and destruction before he himself is apprehended. Simultaneously Kane must clear himself of the initial crime with the aid of Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane). Set against the backdrop of that familiar icon of freedom, The Statue of Liberty, our hero must undergo a death struggle both metaphorically and realistically demonstrating that we as Americans value our freedoms as well as all human life no matter how malevolent it be because it is in our nature to go the distance for all that is virtuous in the world. Otto Kruger's performance as Charles Tobin is very stylistic and on the surface he seems more sophisticated than our earthy hero Kane but Tobin's eloquence is superficial in every sense of the word. Jack Otterson's Art Direction and Joseph A. Valentine's Cinematography are standouts. John P. Fulton's un-credited Special Effects are impressive.

1943's SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an allegorical study of Americana seen through the naivete of a typical family in a quiet and slumberous community. When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle. What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey). The vigilant individual is still the screen's most valuable asset.

1954s REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.

1956'S THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is another good DVD transfer and is Hitchcock's effective remake of his 1934 version. An American couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) visiting Morocco have their young son kidnapped as part of an international murder plot which they can not help but be drawn into. Doris Day's performance is brilliant as the mother whose son has been taken from her. Her initial reaction to the news is almost unbearable to watch. This film is very suspenseful and disturbing, as the odds against the family regaining their boy seem insurmountable as the film progresses. This is reinforced by Bernard Herrmann's almost minimal score, which adds an undercurrent of discomfort to the psyche of the viewer. There are some very memorable scenes such as when James Stewart is followed by echoing footsteps in the empty London streets on his way to finding Ambrose Chappell. The suspenseful Albert Hall assassination scenes are brilliantly filmed and edited. The face of Reggie Nalder as Rien the Assassin is unforgettable. Brenda de Banzie turns in a complex performance as Mrs. Drayton. Bernard Miles as Mr. Drayton also gives an effective performance through the various identities he goes through. And that is one of the strengths of this film: people and places are not exactly as they seem. Characters constantly evolve. Some grow in strength while others are mere shadows of virtue.

The Autumnal colors of New England seen in THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY are a beautiful backdrop to this dark comedy enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's reflective score. As life comes full circle the quirkily eccentricities of the human heart take on new meaning as an artist (John Forsythe) somehow, perhaps unwittingly, makes it all come into perspective. THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.

1960'S PSYCHO is probably Hitchcock's best known film. Its images and sounds are indelibly etched into the psyche of our culture. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the Bates Motel, Bernard Herrmann's score, Saul Bass' main title designs, the shower scene and many other elements are cinematic icons. One element of this film that has not been given due recognition is Martin Balsam's performance as Milton Arbogast the private investigator. Balsam embodied the personification of professionalism and determination yet he was cut off in mid stream. I think there is a statement being made about the very nature of justice and fate and that life is not always fair.",1413763200,,6532,5.122889305816135

There is a lot of bonus material included, such as commentaries and the original trailers.  The discs included are exactly the same as the individual releases (so in rare cases it may be cheaper to buy each movie individually).  But on the whole, this is a nice set and a good value for 7 entertaining Hitchcock films.
