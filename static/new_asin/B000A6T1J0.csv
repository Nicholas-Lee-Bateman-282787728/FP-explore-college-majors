2369153,5,B000A6T1J0,"After scoring big in its initial season, the show came back IN COLOR for Season Two. Even more fun than the first, this season got more creative in it's stories and HOGAN'S crew were presented more ambitious missions. The show got even funnier and the actors were just remarkable. WERNER KLEMPERER and JOHN BANNER were wonderful as Col Klink and Sgt Shultz. Werner was nominated for 5 EMMYS winning 2 for Supporting Actor throughout the shows run. In Season 2 nobody won anything YET, though there were 3 nominations - SERIES - ACTOR (Bob Crane) - SUPPORTING ACTOR (Werner Klemperer) Klink had to wait until Season 3 for his first win. The show found a good balance between drama and comedy in presenting the touchy subject of POW's in Nazi Germany. Early on, there were complaints from Veterans about trivializing the plight of the POW but that soon quieted with the continued humiliation of the Germans by HOGAN'S HEROES.",1420416000,2,923,4.811320754716981

2369502,4,B000A6T1J0,"A number of things have changed between the premiere Season 1 DVD set and this one, for Season 2.

For one thing, the box set is smaller.  It has a few less episodes (because that's what TV networks began doing at the time, ordering fewer episodes), and the five disks that comprise the season are contained in three cases.

Not that that's a bad thing.  It really doesn't make any difference.  What does make a difference is the menu that is used for this edition of the show.  Season 1 merely had a static menu with a picture and the episode titles.  People often complain about such bare-bones menus...but as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for, because in Season 2 we get it:  a nicely-done animated menu -- with an obnoxiously loud audio track that includes sirens and military drum rolls (which is why this DVD set rates four stars instead of five).  The drumming's harsh repetitiveness can be merely annoying in the daytime...but in the evening, try falling asleep watching an episode, only to be jarred awake by strident drums when the episode is over and the DVD jogs back to the main menu.

On the other hand, this time we do get something else buyers complained about last time:  features, including a photo gallery, some on-the-set home movies, network promos and more.  They're a welcome addition.

Like the previous set, these episodes are also closed-captioned, though you can access them only through your TV's remote control, not your DVD player or any on-screen menu.  Kind of odd, but at least they're there.

As for the shows themselves:  it's obvious that in Season 2 the series was finding its stride.  The missions become more dangerous, the villains more villainous.  By this point the writers have managed to inject a more serious side without necessarily giving up the hi-jinks that made the show so popular in the first place.  In ""Diamonds in the Rough"", for example, the heroes encounter a Gestapo man who knows literally everything about their operation; and ""Operation Briefcase"" roughly tracks the real-life assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, including some (fictional) very tense moments when the bomb looks like it may go off prematurely.

More location shooting (and a wider variety of interior sets) indicate that the series was, by this time, operating with a somewhat larger budget.  In the two-parter ""A Tiger Hunt in Paris"", we even go to gay Paree.

What doesn't change is that the shows are still quite funny, if unbelievable.  Even fans of the series will have to admit that the plots have more holes in them than a lace shawl.  In many episodes, all it would take is a conversation between two of the characters for them to realize that they have been duped by Hogan.  (In ""A Tiger Hunt in Paris"", for example, Klink, in Paris, checks by phone with Cpl. Gruber (actually Newkirk) and determines that Hogan has not left Stalag 13.  But when Klink returns to camp, it would require only one conversation with the real Cpl. Gruber to reveal that Gruber never received such a call.)  There are dozens of such incidents scattered throughout the series, so plot-wise the episodes don't bear much inspection.

Also, you may have trouble believing Hogan's German aliases, such as ""Hoganmeyer"".  An Irish name combined with a Jewish-sounding one.  Yeah, that'd be convincing in Nazi Germany.

You're better off if you just go along with it all and have fun.

Quality-wise, the season opener, ""Hogan Gives a Birthday Party"" seems to suffer from poor contrast.  But really, that's not too unusual in DVDs made from shows 40 years old.  One volume of ""M*A*S*H"" has an episode transferred from 16mm, because all the 35mm prints were, unfortunately, in bad condition.  So this is nothing new, and thankfully it is rare.  We're lucky to have the good quality prints we do have, and once again CBS has done a very nice job of mastering them, ensuring that you will enjoy these episodes over and over again.

If only they hadn't put that damned drumming on the menu....",1217116800,3,4010,4.793002915451895
2369503,5,B000A6T1J0,"I love Hogans Heroes, and this season is my favorite.  If you haven't bought a HH  season yet, buy this first.  Why?  Because it is the best season of all and has the best episode of the series ""Art for Hogan's Sake.""

It is hard to imagine HH without all of the main characters, that is why the final season without Kinchlow is the least favorite of mine.  HH#2 is the most original and most humorous of all.  (But all of the others are VERY enjoyable as well.)  You will be able watch these over and over again.

We imagined segments of film lying on the cutting room floor.  Well, now we know that to be true - we had missed so much great comedic content!

The quality of the show video is excellent, as it was originally filmed in 35mm, the quality really shines through (becoming more noticeable are flaws in the sets as supposedly steel doors of ""the Cooler"" wobble in their 'concrete' frames when closed; Something you would have missed watching on a 12"" black and white TV in your brother's room on a UHF station broadcasting a 16mm print that had been in service for 5 years.

2369541,5,B000A6T1J0,"Season Two picks up where Season One left off.  The only significant change was that Sigrid Valdis joined the cast permanently as Klink's secretary.  Valdis guest starred in an earlier Season One episode. One of the things that makes Season Two so enjoyable is that there are no significant changes in plot or characters.  Hogan and his men continue to foil the Nazis while at the same time protecting Klink from being sent to the Eastern Front.

By its second season, HOGAN'S HEROES lost its top ten spot in the ratings, but maintained a very respectable position in the top 20s. This was no easy feat for a World War Two sitcom.  John Banner is just as loveable as Sergeant Schultz.  During the second season there was increased professioal rivalry between Banner and Klemperer in each episode.  In the end, Schultz, even when he is in the background of a shot, always steals the scene with his boyish expressions.

True to all Season Two DVD releases, HOGAN'S HEROES boasts special features including home movies taken on the set with narration by Sigrid Valdis.  There are also some promotional spots by Klemperer and short clips of cast appearances on other shows.  Additionally the opening DVD selection menu has more graphics and sound effects.  The quality of the DVD release is exceptional.

Realize too that this show is 40 years old.  Its historical setting makes the sitcom timeless.  HOGAN'S HEROES continued its Bing Crosby Production schedule at Desilu studios and the outdoor lot adjacent to Gomer Pyle and Mayberry.  Note too that most of the outdoor episodes are supposed to be taking place in the wintertime.  For the most part the series succeeds in portraying cold climate with oily gray smoke coming from metal chimneys, white powder scattered on the ground and sometimes on the foliage, and actors clasping themselves as if they were in freezing cold.  However, lush green deciduous vegetation in the background betrays a warmer climate.

Yes, HOGAN'S HEROES does have a laughtrack.  The laughtrack is the same as used in most Desilu/Paramount hosted television series.  The same laughtrack was used until M*A*S*H ended its television run.  Not bad for recorded laughter.  You also have to admit that most multi-set and outdoor sitcoms fared better when equipped with laughtracks.  Remember how HAPPY DAYS slipped downhill after they began including a studio audience?

HOGAN'S HEROES is a television show that you can watch over and over again.  The fact that the show ran for six years, when all seasons are eventually released, guaranties that you will not grow tired of the episodes.",1144540800,19,2610,4.986111111111111
2369572,5,B000A6T1J0,"I watched just four episodes of ""Hogan's Heroes - Second Season"" last night, and I must say what I have viewed already convinces me the show has lost none of its charm since I first saw it, way back in 1966. Even my 16 year old daughter was pleading to watch more of the zany antics from the cast of Stalag 13; she couldn't stop laughing.

I too was amazed -- after not having seen the syndication of the show in over 20 years -- at how good Werner Klemperer, Bob Crane, John Banner et al really were; they were such comedic geniuses. Their timing and acting was so convincing, no matter how farcical their schemes.  Moreover, the concept of Hogan's Heroes was in itself a clever premise for satirising the Nazis.

All of the shows have been digitally remastered, albeit pan and scan format. The sound is in Dolby 5.1 (mono). Only the filmlet extras, i.e. the gags, Bob Crane-Sigrid Valdis' wedding, Jello/DreamWip commercial with Carol Channing, Leslie Uggums appearance, Air Force recruitment ommercials and two promo spots with Gary Moore-John Banner and the entire cast, are in their original condition. There are also a number of radio interviews. Nevertheless, they are wonderful additions of the show for fans.

With so much jocularity going for it, I can't wait to watch the other episodes on this 5-DVD set, which incidentally is packaged in three slim DVD cases. There's also a nice synopsis of each show on all of the cases. Based on the few shows I've seen of ""Hogan's Heroes: Season Two"" I've already placed my order  for  ""Hogan's Heroes: Season One"", and quite possibly ""Hogan's Heroes: Season Three"".

I don't think a new show out today would survive using this format but Hogan's Heroes will be around for years to come. If you've got season one, or you just remember watching episodes on TV you already know that somehow the writers managed to take a serious subject and get laughs out of it, often while simultaneously tackling serious topics.

Hogan and the gang are always pulling something over on the Nazi's, Sgt. Schultz often in on it even though he doesn't want to be. #1 ""Hogan gives a Birthday Party"" is a good example the way the gang uses a German bomber to bomb their target, along the way kidnapping the General who was so sure he knew how Hogan's mind operated (and taking Schultz along for the ride). #13 ""Art for Hogan's sake"" is another example of this with Burkhalter having stolen a French painting to give to Herman Goering. LeBeau steals it on impulse and Hogan figure out a way to get to Paris (telling Klink that LeBeau destroyed the painting)to have a forgery done to replace it. Schultz gets pulled into that one too, and all the higher ups get fooled.

#1 has a commentary by Patricia Crane, ""Sigrid Valdis""/""Hilda"" this season, while #13 has one by Robert Clary. These are interesting enough (and run almost constantly through each episode) but I found myself having a hard time watching the episode and listening to the commentary (while it's running the show dialog is muted)at the same time, you may want to shut your eyes to the program and just listen to the commentaries.

Disc 5 has the real value in the extras with some old home movies Bob Crane shot on set (worth the most for Patricia Crane's commentary), a blooper reel set up by Bob Crane himself (It's faded and scratchy, obviously not restored), the Crane's studio sponsored (and filmed at the studio) wedding, a couple of commercials(too bad today's actors won't do such things, these are fun), two or three TV appearances (even better condition on these than the show itself) and some other items including a couple in which Bob Crane, as Hogan, did some Air Force recruitment bits- these two were aimed at women which I found to be very interesting.

Only three more months until Season three comes out, I hope it's as good as this set.",1134086400,6,2350,4.628297362110311

As always it is a lot of fun although I prefer Helga to Hilda.

The special features particularly the Jello/dream-whip bit is very good.  The various skits from shows are very good.

Howard Caine and Nina Talbot begin their regular visits as well.  I forgot how nice looking she was in the early shows.

I highly recommend it.",1129766400,4,325,5.0754716981132075
2369601,5,B000A6T1J0,"Hogan is back for season two and as funny as ever. The bonus features are wonderful and you'll appreciate the out takes and 8mm film. Bob Crane is wonderful as the never too serious Col. Hogan, Robert, E. #0876707 (a serial number shared by other camp 13 pows). Did anybody else catch that? Werner Klemperer as the buffoon Klink is wonderful. Klemperer would later appear on the short lived but very under rated ""The Pat Sajak Show"" where he gave Sajak a monacle. It was beautiful, shiny, gold, presented in a very nice leather jewel box. He also appeared on Cynthia Stevenson's ""My Talk Show"" also wonderful. If plots and writers seem familiar, they should as some went on to do MASH the tv series. Remember the unexpolded bomb in stalag 13? Remember the same thing in MASH. Slightly different scripts but equally funny. Bless you, Gene Reynolds!! Don't miss Season Two!! Make that, don't miss all sseasons on DVD as they become available. Favorite quotes: Shultz: ""You can't shoot a man and send him to the Russian front.......No, they could do it."" Hogan: ""You never understand women until you're married....then it's too late."" And, after Klink tells Hogan he's a prisoner of love, Hogan responds; ""Really, how long ya in for?"" This one's a keeper. Add it to your collection.",1129420800,5,1279,4.791855203619909
2369602,5,B000A6T1J0,"Of course the whole premise of the show is completely implausible and ridiculous.  Prisoners of war continually able to dupe their captors and almost single-handedly destroy the German war effort.  Stalag 13 often seems to be the center of the Third Reich.  Prisoners would have their hapless captors believe that Hitler, Himmler and Goering just happened to be dropping in.  Hogan and his cronies go to Paris for days and their absence isn't noticed back at camp. Explosions are constantly taking place in and around Stalag 13 and it doesn't raise an eyebrow as to the source?  Ok, so it didn't and couldn't happen, but since when is television about reality?  This is still a great show.  The cast is outstanding.  Especially good are the 3 leads:  Hogan, Klink and the famous Sgt. Schultz.  All 3 seem to have been born to play those roles and it's difficult to imagine any of them in any other role.  Also quite good are Sgt. Carter and Corporal Newkirk.  The character of Kinchloe seems to be early political correctness and Lebeau is ok, but doesn't have the gift for accents that make Carter and Newkirk so good.  Klink's secretary is strictly eye candy, but very pleasant eye candy, yes?  The shows are very well written and often really funny.  The opening theme is quite good as is the background music.",1128988800,7,1313,4.722466960352423

2369606,5,B000A6T1J0,"I'm guessing these aren't the legendary Bob Crane home movies. But it's good enough to get me to buy this set. I also want to see the ads featuring the cast along with bloopers. This is what I wanted on the first set. Those crafty folks know how to lure us back for more.

When I was a kid growing up on US military bases, I saw a general explode on a Major who jokingly asked how realistic Hogan's Heroes was - turned out the General spent a little time in a POW camp - and he didn't have a Col. Klink to make the time such fun.

But this was one of those great syndicated shows of your youth along with McHale's Navy and Sgt. Bilko (when will those two get the DVD treatment). And someday I will build a house where the bunkbed is an entrance to my cellar.",1126742400,3,758,4.013245033112582

2369608,4,B000A6T1J0,"""Everyone loves Raymond,"" ""Home Improvement,"" ""Full House,"" ""Dick Van Dyke,"" ""Cosby Show,"" ""Family Ties,"" ""Cheers,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Friends""---all may be good shows in your book, but they are hardly unique, wouldn't you agree?  The formula utilized by the likes of the Cosby show, for instance, simply works and that's why we continually are presented with variations of it.  But ""Hogan's Heroes"" is different; unique.  (I'm not saying ""Frasier"" et al are bad shows, mind you, just not as unusually unique.) The comedian Gilbert Gottfried (AF-lac!) has a bit about the the least likely idea to make a sitcom about. Picture this:  A Nazi-era German prisoner-of-war camp; allied inmates behind barbed-wire.  It's a Comedy!  Yeah, right. But somehow it made it into production & now it's getting put out on DVD, finally.  I'm not saying it's the greatest sitcom or anything, but it's a vaudevillian incarnation; a treat of the first order, and can be watched again and again---the test of a genuinely whimsical show. (""Family Ties"" & ""Barney Miller,"" amongst others, were funny when they were running, but are not at all interesting to me anymore, for instance.)  Quite possibly, the thing that saves ""Hogan's Heroes"" is that it wasn't contemporary when it came out.  The plots of this WW2-set show run the gamut of the allied inmates trying to swipe or disable anything of a military nature that passes through the camp, to kidnapping German scientists, blowing up bridges miles from camp, and impersonating German officers in town...as they utilize escape tunnels to leave and return to camp, as well as employing hidden radio transmitters to send and receive coded messages from London, and most importantly play on Camp Kommandant Colonel Klink's gullibility to make him an uwitting partner in some measure, in their exploits. TV programs set in specific historical periods are simply not as easily ""dated"" as other shows are (think of ""Sanford & Son,"" ""Growing Pains; even dramas the likes of ""Hill St. Blues"").  ""M*A*S*H,"" for instance, is still a great show and, like Hogan's Heroes,"" is holding up well. Exaggerated characters helps too---think of Hawkeye Pierce's Groucho Marx-inspired one-liners in ""M*A*S*H.""  Colonel Klink likewise is a standout, and is thus (in my opinion at least) the real star of ""Hogan's Heroes;"" in the same sense that Gracie Allen was more essential than George Burns in making the great Burns & Allen combination successful.  Klink's flamboyantly delicious delivery of his oft-repeated (of course, ridiculously untrue) lines, admonishing anyone and everyone that ""There has Nev-er been an escape from Stalag 13!"" or ""This is the toughest POW camp in all of Germany,"" never get old.  Even funnier is when he cannot even finish such lines before being told to shut up by General Burkhalter or other visiting superior officers.  While you're at it too, there's another show very much like this one.  It was made in the the UK and is called ""Allo, Allo.""  It's also set in WW2 Europe, but this time in a German-occupied French town.  Akin to ""Hogan's Heroes"" the Germans are likewise obtuse while the French resistance attempts to persuade the same unfortunate cafe owner each episode to facilitate their wacky schemes along the lines of Hogan's men.  Check out some reviews of it.  If your're a fan of ""Hogan's Heroes"" you'll probably think it a riot; I do.  Cheers!",1124323200,15,3393,5.068345323741007
2369609,5,B000A6T1J0,"They say that humor is the best medicine for what ails you. They are not kidding. When I need a boost, I plug in Hogan's Hereos and find myself in fits of laughter. I found out from a friend of mind, that the German's actually love this show. Even though the sitcom is not an accurate portrayal of WWII (it was not meant to be), it still serves it's purpose well in providing a humorous look at  something that otherwise would be sad. My favorite scenes, with out spoilers, is whenever Le Beau speaks to the dogs and scolds them and gets them to do what he needs them to do. One time, Le Beau sent the dogs away saying that it was not time for him to be found yet. Another good scene is when Kinchloe impersonates a German Kommandant. Richard Dawson even had the chance of doing a very bad impersonation of Klink over the phone to give orders to the gate guards. It was hillarious.  All truth being told, I'd have to rate the entire series as 10 stars. I saw it way back when, and saw it now, it still pops a gut! I would have to admit that my telling of the funny parts is not so funny. So, give it a try, I am sure you'll love it!",1123718400,20,1132,4.049107142857143
2369610,5,B000A6T1J0,"The writers of this series must have been military veterans.  You do not need to be a veteran, but being one will make the program much more amusing.  The relationship between enemies who respect each other is accurately portrayed.  There is one historical error.  The German Air Force POW camps were segregated.  They were either officers only or enlisted only.

My favorite line is Col. Klink telling Col. Hogan, ""With enemies like you, who needs friends?""

Another is during a visit by the German Inspector General.
Hogan, ""I want to see the Inspector General.""
Klink, ""He is my Inspector General, not yours.""

My favorite scene can only be fully appreciated by a veteran of a war, as I am.  A general is arriving to inspect the POW camp.  All of the field grade German officers are lined up to meet him.  Sgt. Shults blurts out, ""Lieutenant Schmidt......I mean General Schmidt.""  General Schmidt then tells the line of field grade officers that Sgt. Schultz saved his life in the previous war.  He then ignores the field grade officers and walks off with Sgt. Schultz talking old times.

 I have read the previously classified report of the British government on The 1939-1945 war conduct of British POWs and the report stated that the officers gave the Germans a hard time by trying to escape.  The enlisted just sat back and had a party time until the war was over.

Another inaccuracy is that the Allied bombing caused food shortages which affected the POW camps as well as the German population in general.  One of my relatives was emotionally scarred for life from this experience as a POW.

I am not sure of which seasons my favorite scenes and lines are from, but these should give you the flavor of the program.",1123718400,,1723,4.702341137123746
