7824529,5,6302270472,"Well-done film in which a Boston judge deserts his traditional life to find a better, more gentle peace within his existence.  He finds the remedy in the form of a lovely California restaurant owner.  Amusing, romantic and touching.  A sharp comparison is drawn between conservatism and a more casual, liberal way of living one's life.  Tender and gentle throughout with fine performances by Ann Sothern, Martha Hyer and Alexander Knox who
also co-scripted the film as well.  Highly recommended.  Does the judge return to his wife in Boston or remain with the California love of his life?
Tune in to discover the answer...in this very fine film.",1426204800,,645,4.981308411214953
7824530,4,6302270472,Ann Sothern always pleased me and the rare Hollywood ending was believable. An added bit was the fact that I used to walk through Louisburg Square on winter days when I went to school in Boston. It was a very satisfying film.,1417910400,,225,4.380952380952381
7824531,5,6302270472,"Very good story of love, middle age crisis, and responsibility in the end.  Was watching this as I was getting ready for work one morning on TCM and couldn't finish it, but I knew I just had to, so I ordered it.  So glad I did!  I Wasn't disappointed at all in the rest of the movie, it was just as good as the first.  Anyone that loves old movies would like this one for sure.",1404086400,,377,3.9210526315789473
7824532,4,6302270472,"Excellent, a very moving and emotional story, great cast - pity about the ending; I personally would have gone back to California...",1393113600,,132,5.045454545454546
7824533,3,6302270472,"A winsome look at male middle-age crisis before the term became popular, The Judge Steps Out ultimately is less than the sum of its parts.  The Staid (with a capital S) Alexander Knox plays a respected Boston judge saddled with a domineering wife, self-centered daughter, and the nagging feeling that somewhere along the line instead of living life he's just treading water until the Grim Reaper arrives to relieve him of the interminable boredom.

Even a headline-quality custody case can't rouse him from his lethargy.  Cajoled by his wife, he's about to take a well-paying job he doesn't want when, in a moment all too familiar to men his age, he makes the decision (inspired by three days of trout fishing with a wise country doctor, marvelously played by Whitford Kane) to chuck it all and disappear.  For how long, not even he can say.

Eventually landing in 1949's empty and smog-free San Fernando Valley, he finds himself inveigled into taking a job as a short-order cook at Ann Sothern's roadside (Ventura Blvd.!) diner.  She's had a rough life and finds herself falling in love with the courteous, oddly-dignified drifter.  Lacking confidence in his own attractive qualities, and fully aware of the considerable age difference between them, it takes Knox's character some time to respond to Sothern's overtures.  Director-Writer Boris Ingster is no more Robert Riskin than he is Capra, but there is some sharp, warm dialogue between his two protagonists than at times even manages to skirt the boundaries of codified 1949 restrictions (a sly Sothern to Knox while they're bowling: ""I'm going to beat the pants off you"").

It can't last, of course.  It's 1949, and as the Production Code demands, the judge finally slogs back to the wife he's just divorced.  She's shown as coming to regret her earlier treatment of her good-natured husband, and Freda Inescort nicely understates her character's emotional transformation.  But the film's final long shot, of the judge trudging wearily through the snow up the steps to the front door of his respectable Boston townhouse, is genuinely heartbreaking.  One desperately wants to reach into the scene, grab him by the shoulder, spin him around, and shout right in his face, ""ARE YOU NUTS?  ANN SOTHERN LOVES YOU AND IS WAITING FOR YOU IN CALIFORNIA!""

From the opening credits, underscored by Leigh Harline's sumptuous score, it's plain this RKO programmer aspires to be a high-end MGM romantic comedy.  But the undertones are darker and the technical aspects, save for Robert de Grasses' fine b&w photography, are weak.  There are numerous sequences where continuity shots appear to be missing, which might be due to nothing more than poor editing, but which are still jarring.  The backyard set of the diner features one of the worst painted backdrops I've seen in a '40's film...as fake-looking and inadequate as might be found in a cheap musical.  Sothern manages to be radiant throughout despite some overdone hair and unflattering costuming.

Another problem arises from the fact that Knox, while a technically skillful  actor, is Ronald Colman without the emotion.  No matter how hard he strives he's just dry, dry.  You can believe that Sothern's hardscrabble diner owner is in love with him, but not he with her.  He's addled, yes, and confused, and wryly amused, but passionately in love?  Alas for Knox, passion is not an adjective one would ever apply to his performance.  Furthermore, a large cast of skilled character actors, from Florence Bates and Ian Wolfe to the great H.B. Warner and Harry Hayden, completely dominate Knox in every scene in which they appear.  That works in a Capra film because Capra never loses sight of or focus on his principals.  Knox just doesn't have the presence to hold his own among the raft of experienced scene-stealers.

Its noticeable faults and misses aside, The Judge Steps Out is worth seeing for a pleasant and midly entertaining look at the male middle-aged crisis in an era when nobody knew what the hell it meant, or what an actual hell it could be like.  One wonders how many men in the audience of an age similar to Knox's judge Bailey walked out of the theater in 1949 wishing fervently that if the judge wasn't interested, they would glady trade their existing life for one in a diner in California run by the luminous Ann Sothern.",1354924800,4,4345,4.936726272352132
7824534,5,6302270472,"This is one of those wistful post-WWII films that are so often forgotten. At first blush, the story is slight. What give it the power it has is the way the story is told and the acting. Knox plays the title role capably. But its Ann Sothern, a radio/TV/film stalwart for decades, who conveys the infectious warmth, dignity, and humor that was her unique trademark.",1333670400,2,364,4.615384615384615
7824535,4,6302270472,"Growing up in the sixties you would occasionally catch an old gem like this one, but this viewer never did see this particular movie.  By the mid-sixties this kinder gentler story was already considered long out of vogue.  In fact, the only similar fare would be likened to several situation comedies of the day which tugged at the heartstrings.  So, I would say I am somewhat predisposed to enjoy such a throwback to a very different time as portrayed in writer/director Boris Inster's ""The Judge Steps Out"": the story of a staid middle-aged hen-pecked judge who tires of his family life and profession leaving it all behind for a grand get-away.

This movie speaks to something that is quite offensive, but somewhat universal:  What if you disappeared and left your previous reality behind.  The fact that it does so with light comedy-with an even lighter touch makes it all palatable and fun.  The performance s of Alexander Knox as the perplexed judge and the strikingly attractive Ann Sothern as his semi damsel-in-distress cannot be understated as making the movie work.  Alexander Knox was unknown to me and he is nigh perfect as he inhabits his character, Judge Bailey, who is so respected that when he disappears all assume it can only be due to uncontrollable extenuating circumstances...Amnesia, perhaps?  Knox delivers just the right nuance and, I believe, he even had an un-credited role in writing parts he played which is entirely understandable as he grabs full empathy of the viewer, never being outright callous as to what a mess he could be making in the wake of his disappearance.  Watching him you feel caught up in his dilemma in a just short of euphoric way.  He lands in a small roadside berg in California where the pace suits him and the beautiful owner of a roadside diner needs help, but also could use a good man to restore her faith in romance.  For a short time both characters bask in their growing affection for each other.  But, the brooding question of their compatibility due to both age and his abandoned responsibilities cannot be denied as time passes.  There is an underlying heaviness that never darkens the proceedings, but must be addressed somehow.  The movie skirts this nicely and truly entertains in the process.  There's a bit of comic relief in the small role of the lovable George Tobias, known by my generation best for his role of Abner Kravitz (Mr. Gladys Kravitz of Bewitched fame) as well as his many bit parts in innumerable movies and TV shows.  The casting serves perfectly throughout.  It is also noticeable the cinematography is fine too in making every frame warm and inviting while not really ever calling attention to itself.

Go back to an era where movie making was warm and fuzzy, even when taking on subject matter of questionable morality.  There's some slight edginess to the ""heat"" displayed between the two principals in which you know the norms of the day were pushed without going too far (there's a bit of saucy dialogue if you catch it and even a bit of implied illicit romance).  The only question is was the ending the one that the writer believed in or the one the studio demanded which is wholly understandable and forgivable.  It's simply the right ending for a movie that is ultimately heartwarming and, above all, enjoyably from a much kinder gentler time.  The print isn't perfect, leading to the conclusion there was no expensive restoration, but, overall, it looks good and it is a treasure to have it now available on DVD. ""The Judge Steps Out"" is definitely worth a look.",1316649600,6,3558,4.79672131147541
