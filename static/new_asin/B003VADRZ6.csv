4208528,3,B003VADRZ6,"I tend to like workouts by The Firm, but this one is annoying.  No, the instructor is annoying.  I find it especially condescending when she says, ""Listen..."" to announce the next move.  What does she think I'm doing?  I'm already listening to follow along!  I could also do without the high pitched, ""Wooo!""  I'm cringing just thinking about it as I type.

The exercises feel effective, and I like the 10 minute format for each segment.  You can mix and match segments or do them all.  This is great.  I really want to like this DVD because of this format, but the instructor ruins it for me.  Pretty sure this one won't stay in my regular rotation.",1296086400,9,650,4.47008547008547
4208529,5,B003VADRZ6,"The DVD contains 5 ten minute sections:

Lean Leg Definer
Fearless Arms
Bikini Body Blaze
ABS-olute Core
Bun Burn

You can play all or create a custom workout.  There are two differnt instructors Rebekah Sturkie and Emily Welsh, but only one per section.  I thought Rebekah Sturkie did overall a good job leading the workouts with cues, but I noticed a little problem with form.  She flexed her back when she did rows, and you are supossed to keep a straight back.  Emily Walsh's workouts were so fast paced and not very many reps per move, so I had to rewind a few spots.  I like that each section has a mix of ""traditional"" moves like squats, lunges, push ups, and planks, but they added new twists.  They added intervals and isometric moves that burn a lot of calories.  They also incorprate moves that work your core and balance.  The short warm up for each section didn't bother me like it did a previous reviewer, when I did all the sections togegher, so I think that could be personal choice.  I'm used to short warm-ups and cool downs per section from ten minute solution videos.  In fact, I like to add a longer yoga or pilates warm up and cool down, so I will be less sore the next day. Therefore, I actually recommend doing more than what's on this DVD, if you do more than one section.  I think this DVD could help raise beginners to the next level on the target areas, but may not be enough on their own for intermediate exercisers.  I plan on doing all sections or adding them to other workouts.",1294272000,16,1509,4.40072202166065
4208530,4,B003VADRZ6,"I only gave it 4 stars..ONLY because I don't like the short warm up in ever single segment..however, it's not too much of a problem if you are doing them each on a single day..but for most like me who wants a long challanging workout, we like to do the whole entire thing, without having to do the warm up with each part. Kind of like how Cardio Explosion is..there is no fuss with chosing all segments, and having to fast forward each warmup. ;)

Now I recently ordered the FIRM's new ""Express System"", and I noticed that this workout is an introduction to how those might be..except more advanced. :) So I think this was made to have an idea of shorter intense workouts for their newest ones (which I have not yet received, but order is on its way). ;)

As for the workout, not too hard, but more challanging then most of their newest ""pink FIRMS"". I'm glad because this one is sort of like their older ones (if only they would get rid of the warm ups when you choose to do (all 4) like I do. ;)

All segments are nice and challanging..not as challanging as the new Cardio Explosion, but just enough. ;) The Cardio only segment is actually more killer (which is done by Emily). ;)

ALL workouts went by fast...with FIRM videos (which I have been using for the past 15 years now, all have no boredom and is very famous for switching things up. This workout, you only need about 5-10lbs. I could use heavier, but like Cardio Explosion, some reps are fast, so you don't go too heavy. Another thing that bugged me about this video, was that the bonus segment said you have to ""Download online""...not sure why, and I'm guessing you have to become a member on their website..so that kind of peeved me off...it's supposably another 10 min segment--but a ""total body one""..I will update when I try to download it and let you know..other then that..not sure why it even showed up on the dvd...if it's not even on there..>:(

Most of all, I would also love a solid Abs-only segment, but then again, some moves in this workout DOES work your abs even tho you are not doing a solid lying down ab section (which for me anyway, I always feel more complete when having an option for just an ab section).

Overall, grade A. Not A+ if they included the bonus ON the DVD, and not to have to go ""download"" on their website, and wishes you can bypass each warmup with each section when choosing to do all 4 workouts. Other then that, love this workout!!",1294012800,14,2435,4.364238410596027

I'm not always a fan of the Firm, especially when their dvds require you to use their own brand of specialized equipment, that you can't really use with non-Firm dvds.

It isn't the first time I have received DVDs that skip or are scratched from The Firm. When I ordered the Express workout from Gaiam there were 3 that didn't work and ended up needing replacements.

This one in particular I bought to add-on to some of the other ones, but I quickly found out it is a tough workout in itself. This was very difficult and I still have not picked it up 100%.

4208566,3,B003VADRZ6,"I usually love the Firm but this one, although it has good workouts, is not what I thought it would be based on the description. It's great if you really do just use each 10-minute segment separately, but if you decide to do all of them for a longer workout, it's too much of the same. It's supposed to be focused on different body parts: Legs, arms, bikini body, absolute core and bun burn. I didn't really feel the arms workout was enough focused on the arms, and not sure what the bikini body is supposed to do. The Absolute core is supposed to be abs, but again, there's movements in that that are so similar to the other sections that it doesn't deliver the arms workout; my arms didn't get worked out much at all. In the end, it seems like it's all mostly squats, which the firm does too much of anyways (for my taste), so I'm not thrilled with it and probably won't use it unless I do just want a 10-minute workout.",1358640000,,922,4.244318181818182

I particularly love the lower body workouts. The only downside is that they move through the moves pretty quickly and since the workouts last 10mins; you don't really have a lot of time to learn the moves. However, you become more comfortable as you repeat workouts. In addition, this is consistent with The Firm programs. Calorie burn is good too.",1344729600,,519,4.842696629213483
4208576,3,B003VADRZ6,"This fitness dvd is divided into five 10 minute segments that target a trouble zone of your body. It is designed to get your heart rate up quickly to maximize your workout potential in the short 10 minute time allotted. The segments which focus on legs, abs, buns, arms, and total body incorporate cardio aerobics, pylometrics, and old-fashioned toning moves into a fast-paced, lightening quick drill to snap you into shape fast.

The dvd menu which lets you play the segments all at once or customize your workout your way is a little tricky to navigate. It seems to get stuck. Also, the dvd shamelessly plugs several Firm dvds and other products and you can't fast forward or skip these annoying informercials so put it in long before you're ready to work out.

The instructors have to move quickly as the workouts are short which leaves someone who is a little less than coordinated struggling to keep up. If you aren't fast to catch onto 3-4 move combined sequenced, you may hitting the pause or rewind button to keep up or work on your form.

The instructors seem more frantic than encouraging as if they aren't so sure they're going to get it all in in ten minutes. Along with high pitched and shrill cries of ""Let's hit it!"" and ""Woooo!"" they seem to be stretching the bounds of their own fitness capabilities at times.

Stick with it and you'll probably look good in a fairly short amount of time but you might want to mute it first.",1336003200,11,1441,4.573643410852713
4208577,5,B003VADRZ6,"I have to admit, I love working out to the Firm. I love both Emily AND Rebecca, minus the 'woos'.

But I originally did NOT love this DVD...why? I thought it was having issues as many others have also mentioned. I ended up playing it on my work laptop (A Toshiba), as well as in the BluRay player, and all the sections that previously had skips worked fine. So..back to why I loved this DVD.

10 minutes! Now, you're not going to be supermodel skinny if you only work out ten minutes a day. That's common sense. But some mornings, that's all I have before I run the Preschooler to school, and start my workday at home (I work at home AND run my own cleaning business). I also have a 2.5 year old at home, so life is busy.

I can do one work out in the morning, and then if I have time at the end of the day (which I normally do...that's my me time), I can do another 2-3 workouts if I want. And they're over before you know it.

Lean Legs is awesome - I have rather muscular legs, so anything that helps me lean out my nubs is great! And boy, did I feel the work the next day.

Bikini Body Blaze - do not do at 10pm. You'll wake up your husband, who is snoring on the couch. But it's killer cardio! And we all need at least 150 minutes a WEEK of cardio. This helps!

Fearless Arms - whatever. I hate planks. HATE them...but Rebecca makes me do them. And I keep coming back for more. I had ripped arms in no time.

Abs-solute Core - after two babies, I needed work on strengthening my core, like most moms do. This is difficult, but not impossible. Love it!

Bun Burn - I did it two days ago and my backside is still sore.

So...buy this DVD! It works for beginners through advanced. I consider myself intermediate, and I found some of the moves challenging. Remember, as with all workout videos, you get out of them what you put in!",1335312000,19,1832,4.109243697478991

I'm not a novice, by any means, but neither am I an expert when it comes to work outs.  I'm firmly middle of the road and the Firm has always been exactly what I've needed.  Zero in Ten intrigued me due to the option of choosing one or two workouts or going for a longer workout by choosing all segments, which is the best aspect of this DVD.

Incorporating many familiar Firm moves and upping the ante on them, Zero to Ten fits easily into any workout routine.  The pace is upbeat, but also slows down when new moves are introduced which offers beginners a lower level of intensity than experts.  And each segment is only 10 minutes, which the instructors are quick to remind you of often enough that you don't feel like giving up.

I expect that it won't be long before I'm familiar with each workout segment and won't find it as difficult to keep the pace up as I do now, having just received the DVD.
