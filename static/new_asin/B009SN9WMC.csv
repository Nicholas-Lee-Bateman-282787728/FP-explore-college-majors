8544132,3,B009SN9WMC,Great footage of one the greatest trials riders of all time! But I was left kind of wanting more... I wanted to know how how he does some of those amazing advanced maneuvers on his bike. (like balancing on his rear wheel and hopping) But instead it was a lot of basics. Things you can find on other videos that have much more instruction.,1382313600,,338,4.296875
