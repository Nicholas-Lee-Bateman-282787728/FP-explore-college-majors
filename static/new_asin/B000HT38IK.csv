2643308,3,B000HT38IK,"I ordered this DVD mostly to get  ""A Perfect Murder"" which is a good movie
so I thought the other 2 would be a bonus .  The cast in both are all well known and I would have thought they would be good.
Murder by Numbers ,even with Sandra Bullock in it seemed like a low budget flick
Murder in the First  was so boring for the first 45 minutes we finally turned it off.
SO.......the price was about what 1 movie would be so I suppose 1 out of 3 is not too bad",1273881600,,457,3.789473684210526

2643336,5,B000HT38IK,"Murder in the First is such a compelling movie, and Kevin Bacon plays the heck out of the part. One of my favorites of all time. And to get it with two othergood movies is a bonus. Plays great and was here in just ten days.",1437350400,3,223,3.869565217391304

2643362,5,B000HT38IK,I had seen these before and did not realize it.  Enjoyed them for a second time around!  I would recommend these.,1377734400,,113,4.333333333333333
2643363,5,B000HT38IK,"Action packed plots, with good story lines.  Not big on special effects, but the clues to unravel the murders keeps you interested.  Good for a lazy afternoon when you have little to think about except enjoying a bit of entertainment.",1374624000,,234,4.825
2643364,5,B000HT38IK,"I had been looking for ""MURDER IN THE FIRST"" for at least twenty years and was thrilled that Amazon had it.  I believe it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I enjoyed it even more after waiting all these years for it.  My memory of the movie was absolutely correct, it's totally awesome!!!  Kevin Bacon was superb in this true story and the rest of the cast were amazing.  I couldn't' believe that I received two more additional movies for the price of one and they are both really good too.  Thanks so much for giving such great service.  If anyone is looking for a great movie, I promise you won't be disappointed with"" MURDER IN THE FIRST"" !!!",1371081600,,656,4.284552845528455
2643365,5,B000HT38IK,This was a great set!  I mainly bought for Murder by Numbers which I had seen a long time ago.  It is about two teenagers who share in the random killing of a woman.  Bullock is the investigator who herself had been a victim of an attempted murder by her husband.  A perfect Murder stars Michael Douglas and Gwenath Paltro (sp) which full of suspension.  Murder in the First is based on a true story about the shutting down of Alcatraz.  It was a great movie - Christian Slater is the attorney that represents Kevin Bacon.,1369612800,,522,4.385416666666667
2643366,5,B000HT38IK,this is a great trio! i love all three movies and these dvds tend to be much cheaper in the end instead of buying them individually,1355270400,,131,4.076923076923077
2643367,5,B000HT38IK,"I received these as promised and in excellent condition.  They are all good movies, but vary in entertainment value. My favorite is A Perfect Murder because I like suspense, murder mysteries. I found Murder By Numbers unsettling which means the actors did a great job.  The two young actors were chilling.  It did come across as a low budget film.  Murder In The First was dark (literally and in subject matter), but my husband has been to Alcatraz and we have always been intrested in it's history. As I mentioned, these vary in content and affect the viewer in different ways, but all were good, contain good acting and the star power alone make this 3 in 1 dvd worth the price charged.",1339372800,,688,4.569105691056911
2643368,5,B000HT38IK,Three movies for a little of nothing! Murder in the first is the best!  I haven't looked at the other two yet but my wife all of them,1292112000,,133,3.75
2643369,5,B000HT38IK,"These are three very different movies, but they all have fantastic acting and will keep you engaged throughout.  As always, Michael Douglas was outstanding in ""A Perfect Murder"" and the performances of Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen were excellent. Such a great screenplay and with a number of twists in the plot.  If you like action, suspense, crime movies, murder mysteries, revenge with the bad guy finally tripping himself up and being caught by a very intelligent detective you will love it.

In ""Murder by Numbers"" Sandra Bullock was both the main star and one of the Executive Producers and this was a perfect vehicle to showcase her abilities as an actress--which is why I think she selected it.  The two young male actors were so believable as the privileged, bright and bored amoral teens who believed they were smarter than anyone else and could plan and execute the perfect murder and get away with it.  Sandra Bullock was the police detective who was both psychologically and physically scared by a vicious attack years earlier but which still haunted her and which she tried to suppress but which still had power over her.  Great screenwriting, directing, casting in addition to the acting which was excellent.  If you enjoy suspense, detective stories, action and a number of twists in the plot you will be hooked from the start.  Hint:  everything in the movie is there for a reason although it may be later in the film when the audience understands the significance of what they had seen previously.

""Murder in the First"" is supposedly based on a true story the same as ""Murder by Numbers"" and I don't usually like movies about prisons and prisoners who may be sentenced to the death penalty. The acting by Kevin Bacon who played Henry the teen sent to prison for stealing $5 and who ended up spending three years in solitary confinement and being tortured for an attempted escape from Alcatraz was fantastic. Gary Oldman played the Associate Warden of Alcatraz who was a sadist and felt he could do anything he wanted to the prisoners and who actually ran the prison on a day-to-day basis.  Both of these actors turned in academy award quality performances and I found myself completely engrossed in this movie (much to my surprise).  I didn't really like the way they ended it but then maybe that was what happened in real life.

If you enjoy thrillers, this triple feature is a bargain at the price.  Enjoy!",1278028800,2,2433,4.7894736842105265
