1247207,1,B00001WY7P,"I'm sorry if I am insulting the other reviewers, but this movie is transparently stupid as can be!  As the one battered reviewer who dared saying why he didn't like this movie, this totally has that awful ""Made for TV"" aftertaste and the acting is awkward and unnatural, even Mr. Poitier couldn't rescue this film.  Sure, it's nice to appreciate the simple life and living on a farm, but show it with more intelligence and better supporting actors!",987638400,,448,4.730769230769231
1247208,5,B00001WY7P,This movie really touched me and made me re-evaluate my life.  I loved it and plan to buy it when the price lowers!,950572800,5,115,4.0
1247209,5,B00001WY7P,"A wonderfully acted, well-written charming story.  Be sure to keep your hanky handy with this one - the whole family will be teary eyed between their laughter. Sydney Poitier should be nominated for his rich performance  in this little known sleeper. I plan to buy the film for my library as soon  as the price drops to normal range.",950486400,4,333,4.610169491525424
1247210,5,B00001WY7P,"This is a charming ""feel good"" movie with an enchanting performance by Sidney Poitier.  The character, Mr. Dearborn is so endearing and truly magical you will be spellbound. Sidney Poitier has won both my  heart and respect with this delightful piece of work.",948931200,13,259,5.0
1247211,2,B00001WY7P,"Simplistic, hurried, unrealistic, script ruins this movie.  It has that ""Made for TV"" feel about it.  Sidney Poitier was the only element of this show worth 5-stars; however, the plot and other actors were so  cheesy that dragged the rating down for me to a 2.  Only 2 because of SP,  if he weren't in it, it would be a 0!
However, as the other reviewer  stated, this may be a good film for kids to watch with the family.  Kids  like ""Barney"" and ""Pokeman"" for goodness sake, so they  probably won't see the horrific flaws in this work.",947376000,,536,4.333333333333333
1247212,5,B00001WY7P,"This will be one of the classics. Sidney Poitier brings to life a larger-than-life hero who is at the same time very down-to-earth.  A simple man,yet complex enough to attract people of all ages he is the epitome of  the man who has everything.  When a large corporation threatens his way of  life all manner of folks come to his aid.  Much of the film is pearls of  wisdom. And it is suitable for all ages. Excellent family film",946252800,4,429,4.367088607594937
1247213,4,B00001WY7P,"i love to find the ""obscure"" film.  I also love the work of Mary Louise Parker.....thus I rented Noah Dearborn.  What a sweet, insightful film.  my fave line ""when God vacations on earth, He stays with  Noah"".  That is simply beautiful.  This movie is a hidden treasure.  This is a movie about ""waking up"".....realizing that the pace of  life will run you over and you will have missed the treasures God has in  store.  slow down, rent this movie and ponder for awhile. and of  course....Ms. parker - as always tugs at my heart, she is a hidden treasure  as well.",944870400,3,563,4.465346534653466

Respecting the wisdom of the elderly and the simple among us is a theme seldom if ever seen .. wish for more of this genre though I believe a new genre needs to be made.... respect for others , the elderly and the land.. is that a genre yet ?",1452556800,,553,3.990990990990991

1247266,3,B00001WY7P,"This movie was excellent in so many ways, the storyline, the cast, etc.  Though often paired with ""The Last Brickmaker in America"" as a comparable movie, it seriously lacked the pristine character that was so evident in ""The Last Brickmaker in America."".  The ""mild language"" was offensive and did not add, but rather detracted from such a great storyline. Because it is not family friendly, I could not sit my grandchildren, or any child for that matter, down to this movie because of the cussing and one scene in particular, between the unmarried couple, which lacked propriety.",1448323200,5,580,4.969072164948454

1247280,5,B00001WY7P,One of his most memorable performances. Noah Deerborn is truly a man of honor and simplicity. He is a throwback to the days of all manual tools that made his craft a work of beauty. He chose to live his life uncluttered with what most consider modern necessities. Noah's relationships are as genuine and simple as the rest of his life.,1440892800,,335,4.508196721311475
1247281,4,B00001WY7P,"Noah Dearborn is a metaphor for those whose needs don't support progress.

In sum the movie is a wistful couple of hours romanticizing the collision of simple lives with the raw power of cultural change. Poitier represents ageless doers picture perfectly. Mary-Louise Parker dials it in as the bridge figure. Whoever played the irresistible forces of progress dialed that in very well indeed. There wasn't a false note in the acting and the cinematography is very good.

Not sure if one needs to have been in farm homes built before electric or sit at long kitchen farm tables with ghosts to appreciate the sorts of remembrances that amped up the melancholy elements of the movie, but I have sat on a porch alone with a similar box of pictures where the ""new"" ones were 1970s and the earliest were 1870s, It is false to romanticize farm life because as late as the 1960s farm life was brutal, especially for those with only a few hundred acres - or less; still, as hard as it was, it looks better because it really was a simpler life. Good and bad were easier to know.

Noah knew what he knew. He had no idea what he didn't know. And he didn't care. The doctor learned from him. Noah learned from her. Progress's representative didn't learn from anyone. These metaphors were about as good as it gets. And so I enjoyed this movie about as much as any I've seen lately.

The ending was false or this would be a five star movie all the way. In real life Progress wins and simple people are pushed aside instead of ending up being understood and getting a puppy. Even Camille died at the end. In broad terms, Life really is that simple. Because the movie is a metaphor and because the audience was denied the truth  a star was cut in my rating.",1440633600,,1740,4.459119496855346

1247330,5,B00001WY7P,"This story is somewhat mystic in that a man, who lives a simple life, ends up affecting the lives of those in big business, who have a different idea of progress, based on the idea of money as opposed to progress being based on social norms that benefit a community.  Oddly, Noah Dearborn is the only black resident in this community, making race a complete non-factor in the story, which focuses on greed, integrity, and community values instead.  One young woman is brought into the scheme of her boyfriend to remove Dearborn from his land, but in turn, her eyes are open to far greater values in life than money, and begins to see her boyfriend in a different light.  A charming story, which a family can enjoy together.",1407110400,2,723,4.589147286821706

1247361,4,B00001WY7P,"This movie is a great wake up call. Do no let the world press you into its mold. Sidney Poitier plays Noah Dearborn, a man who is basically untouched by the modern world. He's totally focused on his work. He has very high standards. He doesn't hurt any one. His only crime; he has not allowed himself to be truly close to anyone. But when a company comes into to town trying to build a shopping center and attempts to buy Noah's property it shakes everything up. The guy who's heading up the project has a girlfriend who's got true heart. She is able to connect with Noah and see his true self while her boyfriend is only focused on accomplishing his goal without regard to who he hurts.

I acquired it for showing to a group of which some are quite hard of hearing.  It was important that the publicity states it has subtitles in English and Spanish. I, and another person with experience and knowledge of these things, have signally failed to get subtitles on the screen.  We have tried three different players.  Always one gets the message ""This operation is not allowed"".  What puzzles me is that on two different computers I can get subtitles, easily.  So the information is embedded somewhere on the disk, but not available to DVD-players.  One player I tried is moderately expensive and sophisticated.  I think to advertise subtitles when they are not accessible is inexcusable.  Incidentally I noticed with interest that one other person on this web site complains that he cannot get subtitles in Spanish. So I do not think the trouble is in the disk I have here.  Shame on someone!",1386806400,,1011,4.725714285714286

1247397,5,B00001WY7P,"Like ""The Last Brickmaker In America,"" Poitier does an outstanding job making a vital point without color issues being a focus of the message.  The message here has to do with the corrupting influence of materialism and greed on our individual characters.  Our true happiness is not based on the amount of things we can accumulate, especially if we do so at the expense of others.  What makes the film all the more believable and credible in its message is that Noah Dearborn has some issues of his own that need to be overcome.  The solutions are found in a mutual fellowship of love and concern.",1364947200,,597,4.60377358490566

1247420,5,B00001WY7P,"I love this film!  One negative reviewer called it unrealistic. I cannot disagree with that statement.  But, if the way things turn out are unrealistic, that's what makes it enjoyable!  The gist of the story is that Poitier is a very old, far older than his appearance and abilities suggest, carpenter who lives by 19th century means- no electricity or other modern ""conveniences"" other than an old p/u truck.  The suggestion is that his remarkable  condition is attributable to his 'simple' lifestyle.  Also, this fellow happens to own his farm right in the path of a modern development but has no interest in selling. So the developer decides to get the old carpenter committed as senile and unable to manage his affairs and thereby get control of the property. That's all I'm giving away.
The unrealistic aspects of the film are the apparent ease and comfort of a 19th century lifestyle and [SPOILER!!!...] that the oldster manages to escape the clutches of county 'hospital' and hangs onto his property.
The joy of this film rests in ascribing worth to old time skills and values and the aged. I tend to live with 1 foot in the 19th century myself, sometimes using oil lamps and lanterns and making myself as familiar with a variety of hand tools as well as my power tools. When a hurricane knocked our power out for a couple weeks, it caused me and my family no great hardships on that account. So I empathize with doing things the old fashioned ways.  Also, in this movie the good guys and bad are pretty clearly defined and ultimately good triumphs over evil. Yeah, (regrettably!) that IS pretty unrealistic these days.  That aside, this is what I would call a pleasant feel good movie, just like some of the old B&W films of days gone by.  Some adult themes and the plot twists might make this film unsuitable for the very young, I'd give it a PG13 rating.  The commercial rating is ""PG for mild language.""

So if you have any appreciation for the older ways of doing things and the mythos of days gone by, you would enjoy this film immensely.  If you are one who hates to see anyone or thing standing in the way of ""progress,"" you most likely would not. Concerning the performances of the actors, Poitier is great as always and the others entirely adequate within the parameters of the field.  I did not see this as a ""made for TV"" film at all.",1344124800,,2353,4.5738095238095235
1247421,5,B00001WY7P,"Once again, the amazing actor, Sir Poitier, in this production showed the courage and determination needed in difficult situations many families all around the world when pitted against the 'money' system",1343779200,,204,5.612903225806452
1247422,1,B00001WY7P,"This is another one of those movies that pretends to be wholesome but is actually loaded with disgusting hidden messages.  There are so many things morally wrong with this movie that it would take several pages to adequately address everything.  So I'll just mention a few things here.

This movie is about a 91 year old man who makes ALL of the ladies' hearts swoon.  Literally, every woman (young and old) in this film is totally smitten with this 91 year old man.  Whether or not this is realistic is beside the point.  The point is that this movie is pretending to say that,""with a passion for your work, it's possible to transcend age.""  But this movie is produced by the same people in Hollywood who are constantly telling us that being youthful is what it's all about.  If we listen to Hollywood, 35 is old.  So the premise of the movie is disingenuous because it is coming from the same source that tells us that 35 is old.

But we can even find examples within the movie itself which prove that the supposed positive message (about transcending age) is disingenuous.  For example, in this movie, there are two particular women who are hot for Noah.  One is an attractive soft spoken fiftysomething  woman (only 40 years younger than Noah).  Noah treats her like crap.  The other woman is a mouthy thirtysomething tramp.  Guess which one Noah prefers..... The fact that Noah is hot for the thirtysomething tramp while being totally uninterested in the attractive fiftysomething woman shows that the fundamental message in this film is disingenuous.  The youthful woman wins Noah's affection, while the fiftysomething woman is treated like last week's ham sandwich.

In the end, it is unclear whether or not Noah takes the young tramp to bed, but it is implied that he does.  So this movie is definitely not appropriate for miners.",1337644800,2,1838,4.7594936708860756

1247424,3,B00001WY7P,"Since I had a small role in this film I will comment as to what a good family film this is and what a super nice and down to earth person Sidney Poitier is. His performance in Noah Dearborn is very moving and real and while the supportig cast is wooden and could be interchangeable with anyone and the story is thin but pleasent, overall a good watching experience.
Oh I was one of the Deputies that arrests him and later when Sidney knocks out a construction worker I am standing over his right shoulder as he delivers the best line of the film! I will never forget my three days on the set with Sidney and what he taught me about acting. He is one of the best ever on every level! Thanks again Sidney for what you told me.",1327622400,2,724,4.141843971631205
1247425,5,B00001WY7P,"Just as with the understated performance turned in by Mr. Poitier in this film, few words are needed offer a ample-if-belated tribute to this wonderful movie.

A simple story....in fact, an old and familiar story, is told here: a good man vs. an evil heartless corporation, embodied only slightly over the top by George Newbern as the anything-for-money, I've-sold-my-soul representative of the organization that wants to needlessly replace the title character's farm with a Big Box mall of some sort.

Mr. Poitier says relatively few words, and needs no more: he ACTS...and his performance speaks volumes.

Today's crop of young wanna-be Hollywood stars could learn many a valuable lesson in their craft by watching this performance...and screen writers could probably learn how a basic story, without bells, whistles, explosions, or sex, can be so powerful and moving.

If you wish you had more cash or more ""comfort"" items, consider where each of these characters look to for comfort.

1247427,5,B00001WY7P,"I have always loved Sidney Poitier in everything he has ever done. So when I watched this movie at a friend's house, I knew I just had to own it. He is still a masterful actor, even at this ripe old age. In his role, he is an elderly, highly talented carpenter, living without the amenities of modern times, and beloved by his community. In the obnoxious and pushy corporate manner (sign of the times), he is forced to endure the relentlessness of a developer invading and intruding into his life and home, in an attempt to take his property from him, so as to build a huge Wal-Mart type store; and resorted to all kinds of corrupt, cruel & dishonest tactics. But this sweet loner of a man stands up to everyone with dignity and style. Sidney was most impressive too in the manner in which he performed his carpentry skills. The heart-warming performances of actors Poitier, Dianne Wiest and Mary-Louise Parker made this an endearing movie I will treasure.",1318032000,,956,4.5964912280701755

There is quite a bit of profanity as well as a bedroom scene involving an unmarried couple.

1247433,5,B00001WY7P,"THE SIMPLE LIFE OF NOAH DEARBORN concerns an elderly carpenter with deep roots in a small town, located in Anywhere, U.S.A.  In a nutshell, the carpenter (Sidney Poitier) has devoted his life to hand carpentry in the service of the townspeople for decades and decades, carving elegant doorframes, building chairs, carving wooden architectural cornices, and such.  All this he does using hand tools, which he learned to use from his now-deceased Uncle Silas.  Mr. Poitier is loved by the townsfolk for his skills in contributing to various woodworking projects, involving architectural accoutrements, park benches, and furniture.  After setting the tone for this, and other characters, the plot thickens.  A team of lawyers representing a shopping mall developer make plans to remove Mr. Poitier from his land.  First, they offer him about $300,000.  Then, they offer him about $600,000.  Then the lawyers manage to have Mr. Poitier committed to a mental hospital.  Then, they send a team of surveyors and bulldozers to the outskirts of Mr. Poitier's farm.  (Don't worry, I won't give away any more of the plot.)

PERSECUTING NON-CONFORMISTS.  This movie develops the theme of non-conformism, a conventional theme in Hollywood, and the issue of persucution of a non-conformist.  Mr. Poitier is seen by the lawyers a non-conformist because of his unwillingness to develop any long-term relationship with other humans.  But the Mr. Poitier's reluctance to take off time from his carpentry in order to develop a long-term relationship is carefully explained, in the movie, as resulting from his self-devised technique for avoiding pain from loss of his Uncle Silas.  The theme of persecuting a non-conformist can be found in the Twilight Zone episode, THE MONSTERS ARE DUE ON MAPLE STREET.

LOVE FOR ONE'S CRAFT.  A noble theme throughout this movie is Mr. Poitier's devotion to the craft of carpentry.  Any person out there in the audience possessing a technical skill, for example, in carpentry, engineering, chemistry, or computer science, will easily become emotionally emersed in this movie.  SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS featuring Jimmy Stewart (as Lindbergh) is another movie where the theme is a man's love for one's craft (aviation).  AMADEUS featuring Tom Hulce (as Mozart) is yet another movie about a man's devotion to his craft (composition).

REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS.  Another overriding theme in THE SIMPLE LIFE OF NOAH DEARBORN is the team of lawyers representing the shopping mall.  Threats from real estate developers is a recurring Hollywood theme, as most recently set forth in the PIXAR movie called, ""UP,"" and a decade or so ago, in POLTERGIEST, starring Zelda Rubinstein as the spiritual medium.  The theme of encroachment by real estate developers can also be found in the classic book for children, THE LITTLE HOUSE, by Virginia Lee Burton.  Real estate developers is a fact of life that is a source of frequent litigation, as is abundantly evident in books on property law, found in the campus book store of any law school.

HOTTIE.  Actress Mary-Louise is a young hottie, who is the heroine of the film.  She is a physician, with training in psychiatry.  Her interesting way of speaking and her interesting facial expressions will keep all viewers, both male and female, glued to the television screen throughout this movie.  At first, she is the sweetie of one of the aggressive real estate lawyers.  But then, allegiances change somewhat.  FIVE STARS to this easy-to-understand movie.  It is suitable even for little kids.  There are no guns. There are no bad words.  And thank gawd, there are NO COMPUTER GRAPHICS.",1296172800,2,3629,5.166380789022298

The vast majority of his films from ""Defiant Ones"" to ""Uptown Saturday Night"" have merit on some level. My personal favorite is ""Shoot to Kill"", but this is an excellent addition to any DVD library. What surprised me is I had not heard of it until I spotted it on Netflix and rented it. I was impressed with the story and acting by all. A sweet story of a small town and a man that could not touch anyone, but had a great impact on the town's feelings. Beautiful carpentry and excellent directing, sets, cars, costumes, and music add to the experience. Rich in what makes life interesting, this drama pits an elderly man against the all to well known new shopping center developer. Although that has been beaten to death, I still enjoy this version far more than the others. Good quality DVD with lots of replayability. Great family movie.

Noah allows others to run the rat race while he's on his property, doing his own thing, like helping widows and orphans, fixing furniture for those who need his help. That's what I mean about the ""good old days"". When people mattered more than money and things. When home made apple pie was the highlight of the day because it was made with love.

Collect this movie! It's well worth it. Invite others to view it. No cussing, no illicit sex content, no gangbanging. Perfect for the kids.",1207699200,6,942,4.502923976608187
1247453,4,B00001WY7P,"Noah Dearborn (Poitier) lives a simple life off the grid.  He uses no electricity, even his car's an antique.  The local people call him a ""Carpenter God"" and more than one local lady has fallen for his respectful grace.

But he's never been married.  He only had a dog once.  What means the most to Noah is his work and his land--and an out of town developer Christian Nelson (George Newbern) wants to buy the land to build a shopping center.

The offers start kind, $300, 350, 400--thousand dollars.  Then, Nelson gets it in his head that anyone who won't sell their land to him is 'crazy'.  That's when he calls in his girlfriend, Dr. Valerie Craine (Parker), a psychologist to assert just that so Nelson can get Noah committed and have the County seize his land.

Valerie quickly realizes that there's really nothing wrong with Noah. Noah's even managed to convince Nelson's company lawyer to give it all up to go to California and start a vineyard.

Unfortunately, Nelson is not going to be so easy to persuade. The conflict is inevitable, but the acting makes the whole story worth watching. The only reason this film got a 4 star rating is because of the rough cuts that brand it so obviously 'made for television' and distract the viewer at the critical moments.",1205280000,75,1270,4.629464285714286

As stated elsewhere our only disappointment is inability to get Subtitles working in Australia where the machine plays the movie ok even though we are Region 4 and this was Region 1 and CLAIMED CLosed Captions (CC)but no Subtitles appeared.
We are hoping our new Telextext TV (High Definition) set we are getting later this year will improve ability for Subtitles from all region DVD's

1247456,5,B00001WY7P,"As TV movies go, this one is a cut or two above the ordinary. The situation is instantly recognizable. A self-sufficient elderly man, beloved by the rural community where he has lived all his life, finds himself being forced off his land by an ambitious developer with plans for a shopping mall. Sidney Poitier as the elderly Noah Deerborne plays the rock-solid man of character who remains hale and hearty by keeping busy and doing for others, while the rest of the world has rushed ahead without him. Dianne Wiest is an old friend from town who operates a caf and looks after him as much as he'll let her.

The wonderful Mary-Louise Parker, as a therapist, must come to his rescue, as the developers try to get him off his land by questioning his competence, when it's really clear from the story that the incompetents are the ones lined up against him. Everyone in the story has a lesson to learn, of course, even Noah, who must come to the realization that it is not good for a man to live alone. A reading of ""Wuthering Heights"" seems to reveal to him the dark side of isolation. Hands down, this is a feel-good movie, covering familiar terrain, but with a level of intelligence that allows good performances to make it really shine.",1197849600,,1238,4.551569506726457

1247460,5,B00001WY7P,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed this film. Not only are the performances of Poitier, Parker and Wiest realistic and sensitive, yet the story makes some important statements about values and relationships that are quite powerful without resorting to soapboxing and syrup. The films characters, particularly Mr. Poitier's are interesting and full. I believe it's also a terrific film for young people to see as it has some good advice for them in finding greater fulfillment in adulthood.
As always, Ms. Parker gives an honest and real performance. She and Sidney make a great team.

1247461,5,B00001WY7P,This is an excellent movie.  I think Sidney Poitier does an excellent job portraying this character.  Mary Louise Parker is exceptional. It teaches us to remember that money is not everything and that people should look out and care for their neighbors.  All the money in the world cannot make you happy unless you are first happy with yourself.  That is what I think of each time I watch this movie.,1184457600,,400,4.591549295774648

I wonder if the behavior of any developers would actually go far as portrayed in the story, but I suspect there are some who really would stoop to such outrageous behavior.  What was refreshing was the story of a person who learned to be content with his situation and was not a mediocrity.  Noah Dearborn had what he wanted and was not willing to surrender or compromise it.  He had 'spine' and was not a fool. An arrogant developer who had sold his principles for money met his match.",1174521600,,516,4.457446808510638

This movie gives you the perfect inside on what is really important in life. No, not the money or the rush or the importance of an ambitious carreer. It's the search for the soul and human being behind all that, behind a person. What does really matter in life?. This movie opens up your heart and after watching it, you will keep asking yourself these questions: What is love, what is important in life....or in my life.
Don't think it is all so sweet an brushed up in this movie.
Sidney Poitier will take care of that. Great actor. But also MaryLouise Parker acts so well. Her innocense and belief in the goodness of people will help you to get into the story and to finally see what she feels and experiences.
Please...watch it. It makes up for all those violent ""things"" we see and watch nowadays...

He enjoys what he does, he gives a helping hand to those who need it, and lives very simple. Then you get these people who want to put up a mall at the very location where Noah lives, and he doesn't want to sell. The uncanny thing about this guy is he is a workaholic, but he lives an unhurried life. He is 90, but he looks younger. He drives an ancient car from the 1930s that looks like it's in mint condition. He has some valuable property that these people want and they try to declare him incompetent and unfit to get it. How sad. Yet, the movie will not disappoint you.

It makes you laugh, cry and even cheer. To say this movie lacks depth is like looking at the surface of the ocean and seeing only light reflecting off the ripples of the surface. You need to change your perspective and focus your attention to the deeper aspects of what lies below the surface to see the beauty that exists at those deeper levels. If this movie doesn't tug at your heart stings, then maybe the depth, power and beauty of living a simple lifestyle built around doing what you love has eluded the conscious awareness of so many caught up in the hustle bustle of daily living.

Hot Toasty Rag, November 18, 2017

In this adorable television movie, George Newbern is a real estate developer. He has his eye on a rural property in a small town, owned by a very old man. When he approaches the landowner, hes adamant about not selling, so to get his way, George recruits his psychologist girlfriend, Mary Louise Parker, to meet with the man and say hes mentally unfit to keep his property. But when she goes to the town, shes instantly charmed by the man and other residents.

Theres so much to love about this movie. While I normally find Mary Louise to be obnoxious, shes actually sweet in this film and didn't get on my nerves. Sidney Poitier plays the title role in his second-to-last film, and hes just as dashing and charming as he was forty years earlier. Everyone in town loves Sidney, and its easy to see why, since he makes beautiful furniture and is also the local handyman. Dianne Wiest has such a big crush on him that she purposely breaks things in her house just to get him to come over! Its so adorable, and they have a darling rapport together.

Sterling Andersons script is both truthful and cute in its description of Sidneys characterand thereby, Sidney himself. Every single person in the story references how handsome and youthful Sidney is, even though hes supposed to be very, very old. If you like Sidney Poitier movies, or Hallmark-esque feel-good movies, youll love The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn. I do!",1510963200,,1494,4.651515151515151
