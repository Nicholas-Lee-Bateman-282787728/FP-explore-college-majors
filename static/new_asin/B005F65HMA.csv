8469667,5,B005F65HMA,"Fantastic!  Have been watching since my twins were 4 months old up to now (10 months old).  Calms them right down.  We only watch for 15 minutes max at a time once or twice a day now.  Great for feeding wiggly twins a bottle at the same time.  They will sit still very happily to watch.  We have volume 1, too.  I have tried many other DVD's from the library and Happy Valley is the only thing they will watch.  Great because each episode is short and includes a cute, catchy song.  I sing the songs to them even when the DVD is not on and they love it.  The car episode is their favorite.",1386892800,,589,4.043478260869565
