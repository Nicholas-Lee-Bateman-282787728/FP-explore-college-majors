3049684,5,B0010S6ERE,"Ive heard of ROH for awhile now and wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I've been a die hard WWE fan for all my life and I was getting sick of the company. TNA seemed the place to go till they hired Kurt Angle and they turned into a carbon copy of WWE. Ring of Honor seemed the place to look, considering that everyone raves that its the best wrestling around. I researched it on You Tube and I loved what I saw. The dvd is worth the price and I cannot wait for other releases that are coming out within a few months. The picture is crystal clear. However, I don't think this is the best of ROH. I know some ROH might comment about somethings I say, please do. However, please remember that everyone has an opinion.

Pros: Excellent wrestling and some of the greatest stars in wrestling today. Alot of great matches but a few aren't that good-Homicide VS  Antonio Banks-could have been left out. Also, loved how babyfaces did not always win.

Cons: Cheap shots at WWE are out dated; Seems they are trying to make money of names that are already well known (Samoa Joe, CM Punk, Matt Hardy); Hated how a few matches ended with a roll-up alot of ROH stars have awesome finishing moves; The commentators are very soft spoken

Overall, I like Ring of Honor. A good starting place for ROH but check out there website for better dvds of ROH.",1208131200,5,1341,4.309523809523809

8238280,5,B0010S6ERE,"For those who don't already know, Ring Of Honor (ROH) has been around since 2002 & has been called by many as the top independent promotion in the world based off the labeling of being an ""entertaining sport"" than ""sports entertainment"" due to a heavy focus on the aspect of in-ring professional wrestling resulting in the development of stars who have gone to be become top talents & even World Champions in other major organizations including C.M. Punk, Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan), Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, and Austin Aries just to name a few.  ROH released a series of DVD's a few years ago showcasing their matches & this one in particular focuses on some the biggest names to come through the company either as a homegrown talent or some stars from other organizations who made some special appearances in the company's history hosted by Lenny Leonard & Dave Prazak.  Now this set also includes special DVD extras including a Mick Foley face to face promo with C.M. Punk in 2004, highlights of the first two matches in the C.M. Punk vs. Samoa Joe trilogy with commentary from Punk himself, and Bruno Sammartino's confrontation with Larry Sweeney in 2007.

ROH Champion Samoa Joe vs. C.M. Punk - This was the third match in their now famous trilogy with the special stipulations being that there was no time limit & Ricky Steamboat present at the timekeepers table.  Punk attempted to play mind games early while working over the head & neck before both men went into a series of reversals & trading various strikes to the point where one man was busted open allowing the opening for that cut to be heavily attacked with not just strikes but crossfaces & headbutts tearing away at it including one kick on the outside delivered with such force that it destroyed the guardrail.  Both men continued to trade momentum countering each other's offense from a shining wizard into a snap slam or full nelson into hammerlock DDT or delivering some impactful offense in & out of the ring ranging from a tornado DDT to a lariat that turned the other guy inside out to the point where they started to get desperate with tactics such as hair pulling & using the ropes illegally.  This was a ""war of attrition"" as it was literally both men wrestling each other into exhaustion.
""All Star Extravaganza II"" Dec. '04

Full Impact Pro Champion Homicide vs. Antonio Banks (M.V.P.) - Banks used his power to his advantage with shoulder blocks & a big boot while Homicide relied on his wrestling & aerial skills such as head scissors & one flip suicide dive that took himself over the guardrail into the crowd before working on keeping Banks grounded working over the neck.  They traded momentum with Banks still relying on his strength with power moves like the delayed vertical suplex & a bearhug into spinebuster while Homicide continued to attempt to break him down going after the neck from DDT's to even a piledriver on more than one occasion while also getting desperate with some of the tactics he was using.  This match used the classic ""power vs. speed"" formula however it never really picked up past first gear over time resulting in an average match that I think was just put on here due to the heavy push both men received in their respective companies during this time (Homicide as part of TNA's Tag Team Champions L.A.X. & M.V.P. as the longest reigning WWE Untied States Champion).
""Do Or Die IV"" Feb. '05

James Gibson (Jamie Noble) vs. Roderick Strong - Both men started out with similar strategies working with grounded stretches before Strong started heavily working over Gibson's back using the environment around the ring to his advantage along with submissions & his trademark backbreakers throughout the contest to the point where Gibson was heavily showing the effects when executing his own offense as it was hurting him just as much while continuing to attempt to work over Strong not just on the mat with different types of suplexes but also aerial as well such as a top rope frankensteiner & even a suicide dive that hurt himself.  This was a very good match telling the story of Strong heavily targeting the back while Gibson was will to hurt himself just to hurt Strong even more.
""New Japan's Best Of The American Super Junior Tournament"" Apr. '06

Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan) vs. Spanky (Brian Kendrick) - This match had a very unique back story to it as both men broke into the business together training though Shawn Michaels' wrestling academy and both men showed that they knew the other very well as you saw various counters to each other's offense from Spanky trying to work over the arm to Bryan choking him with his own arms while Spanky was able to keep countering Bryan's submissions & use his own momentum against him sending him to the floor only for Bryan to do the same thing later on as they went back & forth picking up the intensity with such offense like the Cattle Mutilation & Sharpshooter submissions to aerial offense like a frog splash or suicide dive to other moves from an airplane spin to slice bread #2.  This was a contest where the two guys were so evenly matched & knew each other so well that it came down to one guy being able to catch the other guy.
""New Japan's Best Of The American Super Junior Tournament"" Apr. '06

Matt Hardy vs. Homicide - It's no secret about the set of circumstances that caused Hardy to be released & come into ROH during this period of time but after he resigned with WWE, the crowd here was in full support of Homicide despite the fact that he wasn't a fan favorite at the time & viewed this match as ""WWE vs. ROH"".  Both men went back & forth from the start and didn't let up as both executed different styles of offense only for the other man to eventually find a counter or come right back with a move of their own from Homicide's head scissors takedown to Hardy's side slam & an eye poke to being thrown in the outside guardrail to both men trading punches before going into a bigger series of counters & reversals involving the Twist Of Fate & Cop Killa & Ace Crusher just to name a few.  This was a very good back & forth contest.
""Redemption"" Aug. '05

Matt Hardy vs. Roderick Strong - Hardy came out strong (no pun intended) targeting Strong's neck with a headlock & keeping a strong hold (again, no pun intended) on it no matter what Roderick did only for Roderick to apply the same strategy with Hardy's arm before both men exchanged chops with one man getting hit so hard & loud that the facial reaction was priceless while the other ended up hitting something that caused him to hurt himself before the action picked up in the ring with Hardy attempting both hard hitting moves & submissions trying to target the knee which Strong did show signs of hurting when attempting his own offense while the same thing eventually happened to Hardy as well when Roderick worked over this back with his own set of impactful offense & submissions.  This was one of those matches where both men were evenly matched as both guys applied the same set of strategy against the other one.
""Punk: The Final Chapter"" Aug. '05

Christian Cage vs. Christopher Daniels - This was the first ever singles match between these two men as the early moments had both men evenly match from feeling each other out to countering each others offense & pin attempts to exchanging chops before one man resorted to dirty tactics to finally get an advantage heavily working over the midsection with stretches & impactful moves like the gutbuster & constantly going back to that part of the body to break his opponents momentum but kept showing off in the process allowing the other man to take advantage with some submissions & offense of his own as both men went back & forth with aerial offense with the B.M.E. & frog splash to blocking & countering each other's signature maneuvers.  This was a great match as far as storytelling of working over a body part & both men being evenly matched throughout the match to the point where it came down to one man being able to catch the other.
""Generation Now"" July '06

Samoa Joe & Jay Lethal vs. Homicide & Low-Ki - This match started off as a four way brawl with Joe & Lethal taking control working over each man individually causing The Rottweilers to rely on singling out one man & working him over through double team maneuvers such as a spike piledriver to even a top rope bulldog off their partner's shoulders & one guy working him over in the ring while the other did the same on the outside along with using illegal tactics to stop their momentum & taunting their partner into the ring to distract the referee whenever he was being bullied as well.  The tensions kept rising throughout the match to the point where it evolved back into a brawl on the outside with chairs being used & eventually making it's way through the crowd to the back of the building as ladder came into play as well and blood was shed.  This match gave you a mix of everything as it started off as an intense tag team wrestling match before becoming an out of control ""extreme"" brawl.
""Punk: The Final Chapter"" Aug. '05

Well this was a DVD that delivered on exactly what it promised as you saw wrestlers who are well known today back when they were fighting to give the quality wrestling performances that would eventually put them on the map while also seeing superstars come to test their skills against the same set of young up & coming talent so overall this is a quality release I would add to the collection.",1383350400,,9501,4.598346131128175

8238282,4,B0010S6ERE,"Ring of Honor is the last true wrestling company that gets a lot of press in the US for the content of its MATCHES. This is a simple look at some of the wrestlers who have moved on to the ""Big Two"" - showing that they COULD wrestle before WWE and TNA taught them to follow a skit manual. Samoa Joe, CM Punk and so many more in matches that show respect to the lost art of a wrestling match. Awesome wrestling in a bare bones production - As close to ECW as we will ever see. I hope the new owner of ROH will put them in the running and make them  a brand to watch!",1307923200,,564,3.8205128205128207
8238283,5,B0010S6ERE,"They were Ring Of Honor stars. A place where gimicks were okay but in the ring action is what counted! Let's not waste time, let's get to the review:

Samoa Joe Vs. C.M. Punk (ROH World Title Match) - This was the third and final bout between these two as they went to two 60 minute draws in the previous encounters. Joe (who was into his SECOND year as ROH Champion) had been unable to put away Punk and with the stipulation of ""Punk's Last Chance"" and with future WWE Hall Of Famer Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat at ringside, this was sure to be a classic!

You'll see lots of moves from these two (many of which they don't do in WWE or TNA today). It ends with Joe's Kokina Clutch chokehold knocking out Punk after 30 + minutes of action!

Homicide VS. Antonio Banks (MVP from WWE) - This was for the FIP World Title which Homicide held in this match. An okay bout from both men that saw a lot of dirty wrestling towards the end from the ""187"". Ends with a vicious clothesline from Homicide for the victory!

Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan of WWE) Vs. Spanky (Brian Kendrick) - If only WWE would let Danielson wrestle like this!? This was an awesome display from him and Spanky in this one! Both men using high risk manuvears but it was Danielson's mat skills which made the difference as he used the ""RegalPlex"" (made by William Regal) to get the victory!

James Gibson (Jamie Noble) VS. Roderick Strong - A good bout as Jamie was between tours of WWE. Roderick was beginning to come into his own as a singles wrestler and this was his biggest bout to date against the established WWE star. Ends with a win for Jamie.

Matt Hardy Vs. Homicide - This was in 2005 right before Matt returned to WWE! The home ROH crowd was surprisingly split between the two as some cheered for Hardy while others cheered for Homicide. We did see a more aggressive style from Hardy and at least one new move (Splash Mountain/Razor's Edge) from Hardy. Ends when both Jay Lethal and Low-Ki (who had their own feud going at the time) get involved and causes Homicide to lose this one.

Matt Hardy Vs. Roderick Strong - This was Matt's third and final match before returning to WWE. Hardy was clearly a heel in this one while the home crowd was solidly behind Roderick Strong! Strong picked up the win in what had to be (at the time) his biggest win! As we know now, he would go on to win ROH's top prize in late 2010!

Christopher Daniels Vs. Christian Cage - This is when Christian was working between ROH and TNA. He clearly was a heel in this one as the home crowd was solidly behind Daniels. A good match that ends with Daniels' ""Angels Wings"" for the victory.

Samoa Joe & Jay Lethal Vs. Low-Ki & Homicide - A wild tag team match to end this one! These guys were all over the place! We saw wrestling and fighting all rolled into one here! The official end was Joe and Lethal winning by DQ when Homicide elbowdropped the ref before he could make the three count on his partner Low-Ki! But it didn't end there as these guys went into the crowd fighting. After about 10 minutes of that, it ended when Lethal was laid out with the ""Ki-Krusher"" and Homicide and Low-Ki was able to escape!

Overall, I was pleased with this release and will be looking up other ROH releases in the future! Recommended buy if you are tired of what WWE and TNA is offering!",1303084800,2,3331,4.349436392914654

8238285,5,B0010S6ERE,"Let me start off by saying this is one of the three dvds that made me a ROH fan.

Samoa Joe vs CM Punk : Umm wow this is a great match and I think it's one of the top 10 matches in ROH history these work it to a tee they do have one match which is a little better but imo I like this one just as much

Homicide vs Antonio Banks (MVP) Ok my least favorite match on the dvd as it just doesn't have much goin for it and the crowd doesn't really care for it at all

James Gibson vs Roderick Strong If you havn't seen Jamie Noble go in the ring in a flat out wrestling match then this is for you as it's a pretty good match but Roderick has a better match on this dvd so just wait for the best of him

Bryan Danielson vs Spanky I'm in love with this match it shows how good spanky really is and show why Danielson is one of the best in the world must see match again

Matt Hardy vs Homicide This is a pretty good match between these two and is very watchable but it is overshadowed by the next match

Matt Hardy vs Roderick Strong This is the best match I've seen with Matt Hardy in a 1 on 1 match these two put on a great match that is really worth watching if you're a Matt fan but heck I'm not a huge fan of him and I love this match

Christopher Daniels vs Christian Cage This is another very good match but it may not reach your full expectations but it is very good and ages well

Samoa Joe and Jay Lethal vs Low Ki and Homicide Mainstearm fans will love this match because it is really booked to where every wrestling fan would love it and I don't know someone who hadn't seen any ROH before I showed them some matches this one included and they say this stuff is great

So enjoy as you just get some of the best wrestling in the world",1238803200,,1737,3.843137254901961
8238286,4,B0010S6ERE,"This is the best dvd to pick up if you want to know how some of today's new stars began.  This is also a good dvd to show you some of today's stars actually wrestle, unrestricted, and with full potential.  I'll put it to you like this:  for an ROH retail dvd, it's a dvd to own.  For a general wrestling dvd, it's a dvd to own.  If you're a fan of Samoa Joe, C.M. Punk, Homicide, Jay Lethal, Matt Hardy, or even remotely a fan of MVP The Brian Kendrick, or Jamie Noble, this is a dvd to own.",1231459200,,491,3.87
8238287,5,B0010S6ERE,"Yes, I took a TNA catchphrase and applied it to a wrestling company that actually lived by the tag line. Most fans of mainstream promotions will not have heard of Ring of Honor, yet the promotion has given birth to some of the biggest stars of WWE and TNA. CM Punk, MVP, Samoa Joe, Jay Lethal, Homicide and others were all born out of ROH so I guess we owe the company a thank you.

Those not familiar with the history of the promotion, let me give you a quick overview. The promotion was first founded in 2002 by Rob Feinstein, but was later bought out by Cary Silkin who is the current owner. Their match booker, Gabe Sapolsky was a man trained in his craft by the one and only Paul Hayman. Let me be honest and say Hayman has taught Gabe well as he has never but on a bad wrestling show. Their first show ""Era of Honor Begins"" was held in Philadelphia and featured such names as Super Crazy, Eddy Guerrero, Brian Danielson and Low Ki. This gave us a 3 hour non-stop wrestling show that took the hardcore ECW fans and new wrestling fans alike and said ""Don't worry, wrestling isn't dead yet."" Since 2002 ROH has grown into a promotion able to hold successful shows around the world including Japan and the UK. This DVD along with the other three are their first widely released DVDs as previously their show DVDs have only ever been sold on their website or other wrestling related websites.

This DVD along with the other three showcases the talent of ROH to a wider audience and Stars of Honor is the place to begin. With the match list it showcases some of the best matches from the company featuring their biggest talents. Special features include appearances from legends Bruno Sammartino and Mick Foley. Below is the match list for this DVD that I promise you won't be disappointed with.

1. Samoa Joe vs. CM Punk -12/4/04 (features new commentary)
2. Homicide vs. Antonio ""MVP"" Banks- 2/19/05 (features new commentary)
3. James (Noble) Gibson vs. Roderick Strong- 4/2/05 (features new commentary)
4. Bryan Danielson vs. Brian ""Spanky"" Kendrick- 4/2/05 (features new commentary)
5. Matt Hardy vs. Homicide- 8/12/05
6. Matt Hardy vs. Roderick Strong- 8/13/05
7. Christopher Daniels vs. Christian Cage- 7/29/06
8. Samoa Joe & Jay Lethal vs. Low Ki & Homicide - 8/13/05

Very good DVD that for any wrestling fan is a must own.",1219190400,,2331,4.596153846153846
