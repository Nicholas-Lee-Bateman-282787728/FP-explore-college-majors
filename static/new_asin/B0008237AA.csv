2256961,5,B0008237AA,"Finally!  A real, hard documentary that asks the hard questions.  This is exactly what I want to watch on tv, yet never get.  When I want to watch news, I want hard news, not softboiled, mindless so called ""infotainment.""  I want something that engages my mind instead of abusing it, something that gets to the real issues.

""Orwell Rolls In His Grave"" is a superb though slightly low budget documentary that explores in depth the relationship between our wretched media and our increasingly wretched ""democracy.""  More than ever before, our country is becoming a shallow, manipulative oligarchy where the ultra greedy squeeze not only money out of the poor, but also steal their access to intelligent programming and truly informative information.  It also exposes the operations of Diebold and others in the very questionable election process along with the media's weak reaction to this controversy.  Another key element is the examination of Bush's FCC, Michael Powell and the myth of deregulation.  I would almost label this as essential viewing to anyone that still believes, deep in their heart, about American democracy.",1119830400,23,1128,5.1878453038674035

First note: This is a documentary: no slick production tricks, no gags, no car chase, no explosions, no cheesy gimmicks designed to appeal to the proto-hominid part of your hind-brain. Second note: the signal to noise ration is high on this puppy: this will require your attention and concentration. There is a lot here to digest and you will NOT feel all warm and cuddly when the credits roll. HOWEVER - you will not passively watch your TV the same way again afterwards. There will be gnawing questions about ""the message behind the message"" and ""who wants us to swallow this load?"" For the media savvy the message will not be new: media consolidation, too much power in the hands of too few, questionable motives of owners and editors. Not easy or simple - but these days, what is?

It's like this: ""Money is fine but power is better - there's no tax on power.""

2256964,5,B0008237AA,"The chilling documentary film ""Orwell Rolls in His Grave"" examines the relationship between the media, corporate America, and government. In a country where the ""top 1% control 90% of the wealth"", the film argues that the media system is nothing but a ""subsidiary of corporate America."" It's a stunning fact that the media received 1 billion dollars in campaign ads for the last election. Large corporations own the television networks, and the sheer number of stations/channels available gives the public the ""illusion of choice."" Yes, there are tons of channels to chose from, but this ""ostensible diversity conceals an actual uniformity.""

""Orwell Rolls in his Grave"" gives the big picture of the media system in America and asks why some important stories are not covered by the mainstream news and remain invisible. Other stories appear and sink rapidly--while some stories are repeated over and over. Using references to George Orwell's masterpiece ""1984"" the filmmakers establish the idea that ""1984"" isn't just fiction any more. The premise of Orwell's novel is that language is redesigned and history rewritten to control people's thoughts. According to the filmmakers, the American media system at best--filters the news to the populace, and at worst--is the mouthpiece of its corporate and political masters.

This information packed film examines the ties between media, corporations and the government using facts and figures--as well as a number of news stories. The film focuses on media coverage of the 2000 election, and the juicy detail of the purging of Florida voter rolls. According to the filmmakers, when journalist Greg Palast broke the story for the BBC, major American networks declined to explore the story further as Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida, and naturally the focal point of any investigation into Florida voting, debunked the story. The filmmakers point out the outrageousness of the squashing of a story simply because the person being investigated says it's not true. This section of the film also gives details regarding the Supreme Court Justices who voted to terminate the Florida recount. It's interesting to see who voted against the recount, and that two children of these justices then got positions in the Bush administration. Is a quid pro quo system at work behind the scenes--are deals made, jobs given, contracts awarded to 'friends' of the administration? Well watch the film and decide for yourself.

The film includes interviews with a number of experts on media--including Charles Lewis, the director of the Centre for Public Integrity. Lewis has an engaging candor that is refreshing and genuine. Michael Moore appears in a few brief clips from a speech he gave, and there's also some clips from George Bush. Witty and entertaining Vermont congressman, Bernie Sanders weighs in, and there are also interviews with Danny Schecter, director of ""Weapons of Mass Deception"", and legal expert Vincent Bugliosi. The film winds up with information on the FCC (Michael Powell, son of Colin Powell is head of the FCC), lobbyists, corporate watchdogs and regulators. For a behind-the-scenes look at the structure of the American media system, I recommend ""Orwell Rolls in His Grave."" The information here is at once enlightening, chilling and downright depressing--displacedhuman",1119398400,265,3323,5.325714285714286
2256965,5,B0008237AA,"""They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality...and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.""

This quote from Orwell's ""1984"" is used in the opening sequence of this film, and sums up America's media structure frighteningly well. Media shapes and alters human consciousness, collectively, it shapes and effects the collective reality.
This film serves as a WARNING: the U.S. media is an ANTI-democratic force, a weapon of ""doublespeak,"", a subsidiary of corporate America which shapes and determines the legality, constitutionality, and 'facts' of democratically newsworthy events and issues from official, inside sources, instead of(and quite OPPOSED TO, in fact) true journalism, or even any vague sense of it. Specific, essential words/language are not used, not permitted, within our media, in order to reduce cognition. In America, truth is staged and 'managed' to that extent, the pattern with which stories and events are covered, dropped, spun or omitted, is strategically deceptive.

When you consider just how many people either don't understand that, or flat out don't care, or actually believe that we have a free, 'liberal' media....the mind boggles, yet you can't help but marvel at it's efficacy.

As Mark Crispin Miller makes the illustration with a quote from Nazi Joseph Goebbels: ""What you want in a media system is ostensible diversity that conceals an actual uniformity.""

This doc, previously only available at Buzzflash, examines the consolidation of media(which=consolidation of voice=consolidation of 'one truth')and why certain stories are obviously NOT covered in our ""free"" press: the illegal behind the scenes actions of, and overall unconstitutionality of, the 2000 (S)election, Bush's SEC violations of insider trading, the WMD's: WEAPONS OF MASS DECEPTION used by our media to get a supposedly democratic nation behind a totalitarian invasion/occupation, the Telecommunications Act, and even delves into the Reagan/Bush years, examining October Surprise(watch ""Cover Up: Iran/Contra"") their 'Orwellian' use of the term, ""de-regulation,"" again, anti-democratic policies, and the killing of the Fairness Doctrine, which meant that media outlets no longer had to air opposing viewpoints.
This results in less knowledge, less facts, one widely accepted (un)reality, and reveals how the fascist right wing has been on the march for decades, infiltrating *every* aspect of the corporate culture. It's overt and underlying effects of how it's dumbed down collective reality and worked to induce frighteningly large percentages of our populace into chauvinsitic, hate-filled 'super patriotism,' greed, apathy, unconscionability, often through brainwashed fervor and manipulated ignorance(dumb as a stump & fightin' mad to prove it!)can be seen literally everywhere these days.

Imagine 1% of the population effectively conning and convincing the other 99% to support their wants and desires, and those wants and desires are grounded in greed, debasement and mass murder: the media, once a means of keeping power in check, is now the very tool to con and convince the 99% that greed, debasement and mass murder aren't 'really' bad, for such values are generally promoted and exhaulted within the corporate culture...and likewise(to further confuse and control)to convince the 99% that the obvious greed, debasement and mass murder *aren't really so.* This form of indoctrination has gone a long way in creating this widely adhered to perception of a 'reality' which simply doesn not exist: it's a euphemistic unreality.
Naturally, when you try to show evidence of this to people, there is a strong reluctance, a deep seated inability to be capable of understanding it, because the unreality has been accepted by so many, for so long.
Go back to the quote from Orwell: ""They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality.""

Accept Flagrant VIOLATIONS of REALITY.

If you care about and lament the death of democracy ~ and you either care or you don't ~ and are troubled over what terminal, pitch-black ending this could lead us to, please watch this obelisk of a documentary. The presentation is dead on, the sources reliable and seasoned. Those interviewed are plain speaking communicators who resist the 'kids gloves' approach/denial to the fascist, perilous dilemma which menaces our fragile democracy, and inevitably, civilization, and the fate of our species.
Also watch ""Manufacturing Consent,"" ""The Corporation,"" ""The World According To Bush,"" and ""Control Room,"" (about Al Jazeera's television news coverage of the Iraq invasion)and lastly, I'd recommended the brilliant and overlooked Tim Robbins mockumentary, ""Bob Roberts,"" which chronicles the rise of a fascist, right wing, messianic senator.",1118534400,165,4809,5.570451436388509

Orwell Rolls in His Grave is obviously timelier and devotes some attention to more recent events such as the 2000 election and the propaganda produced to sell the Iraq War.
Also, there is some history given to how the extreme right has used media through think tanks, manipulation and deregulation to gain and hold power.  Orwellian use of language is demonstrated with chilling effect.

This film ties together the corporate, political and media machines in a particularly brilliant way with a combination of interviews, news footage and factually-based commentary.

2256967,5,B0008237AA,"Never really released to theaters and for a long time only available through Buzzflash.com, Orwell Rolls in His Grave is to my mind the best political documentary of 2004. It tackles big issues in compelling ways, using the intellectual frame provided by George Orwell's 1984 as a way of exploring the rise of corporate media, the near collapse of responsible journalism, and the decline of ""reality-based"" culture. Although the film's subject is dark, there are many heroes here, including Charles Lewis (founder of The Center for Public Integrity) and investigative journalist Greg Palast. Perhaps the most overtly chilling moments are from the FCC hearings on loosening media regulations to allow more corporate control of local markets by fewer companies. The bad faith testimony of the FCC chair and his sychophantic aide is jaw dropping proof of the depths human beings can sink to when driven by greed and self-justifying ideology. Although the deregulation is stopped by an unprecedented public outcry, the true horror gradually sinks in as you learn that the corporations quietly get what they want by having their bought-and-paid for congress attach pieces of larger legislation to various bills without drawing public attention to what is going on. A remarkable and powerful piece of film making, worth owning and lending to friends.",1117584000,16,1344,5.285046728971962

2256969,5,B0008237AA,"It used to be in America that the media--radio; television; newspapers--acted as a Fourth Estate to prevent government officials from getting away with things.  But as Robert Kane Pappas' documentary ORWELL ROLLS IN HIS GRAVE shows us, that very media, through mass consolidations, has for a long time been in bed with the very government it once kept in check.

Taking many cues from legendary writer George Orwell's nightmare novel classic ""1984"", Pappas, through interviews with people like Vermont congressman Bernie Sanders, former ""60 Minutes"" producer Charles Lewis (now the chief of the Center for Public Integrity), BBC reporter Greg Palast, and former Los Angeles County prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, shows us how so many of Orwell's frightening depictions of a future in which the people are treated by the media as so much cattle have now come frighteningly true in a nation where freedom, democracy, and justice are shouted out as virtues to the rest of the world, but virtually no longer acted upon on our soil.  The lynchpin of this is the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed large corporations to buy up television and radio stations and newspapers in major markets, and thus control the lion's share of what people read, see, and hear.  This leads to big profits for the corporations, of course...and the reality that progressively less of the truth, and less of the really important issues, are being discussed in print and over the airwaves.

ORWELL ROLLS IN HIS GRAVE also shows how the media's getting in bed with politics resulted in presidential campaign cycles not only crossing the $1 billion threshold, but also how much the media (particularly Rupert Murdoch's far right-wing Fox News Channel) had its way in dealing with a compliant FCC, a cowering Congress (Sanders and a few others excepted), and an enthusiastic Bush presidency.  It leads up to stoking America's fears of terrorism post 9/11, and the eventual selling of the war in Iraq.

The outrage over all of these hideous things should long ago have stirred everyone into action.  But apparently, we Americans are an indifferent people who accept too much of what the government and its media cronies tell us as Gospel.  Pappas and his film suggest that the time to stop it is now, before America becomes a completely corporate fascist state.",1219190400,4,2337,5.049350649350649

2256972,5,B0008237AA,"Since there are already some very comprehensive and accurate reviews on this 5-Star documentary (based on content instead of glitz and cinematography), I would just like to emphasize a few important points that may have been missed or minimized.

First and foremost is the review from the 'New Yorker' relied on by Amazon above.  ""The film revisits issues that have been debated ad nauseam..."" It is hard to imagine a more misleading and incorrect statement.  The film persuasively makes its argument with issues that SHOULD have been debated ad nauseum in the mainstream media, due to their extreme importance and newsworthiness, but were not.  The issue that may not be spoken of, the issue of corporate control of the media and corporations themselves, leads the list.  Charles Lewis, former 60 Minutes producer turned media public interest crusader, delves headfirst into the issue with the disclosure of the little known fact that the biggest special interest lobby in Washington is the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB).  The documentary uses facts and observations from an impressive and diverse array of experts and weaves them around an equally impressive array of facts, statistics, interviews, and statements from public figures.  Pappas doggedly summarizes some of the more important issues (already accurately outlined in many previous reviews) deliberately excluded or given short shrift by the corporate media monopoly, while at the same analyzing the corporate dominance of the media and the seldom examined results from that control (especially the non-reporting of issues and events that may be detrimental to the corporate media's interests specifically, and corporate interests generally).  As Ralph Nader argued for the past thirty years or so, it is much like the old Soviet system where individuals in the Party could be criticized, and a host of other issues could be addressed, but the Party itself was a verboten issue.  Similarly, the interviewees point out and evidence (especially with Charles Lewis) that bad corporate players may be attacked in the mainstream media, and an infinity of business-friendly issues and topics may be examined, but corporations as a topic unto itself is a verboten issue, other than singing the praises of corporatism (as the various corporate bootlickers that grace our television screens do ad nauseum infinitum, both implicitly and explicitly).

Pappas deftly weaves in the central theme of ""1984"": control of the media as a means to control society and subvert democracy.  A controlled media is the foundational platform from which all the other tools of totalitarianism are launched.  Control is effected not solely by censorship of information, expression, and events by the Ministry of Truth, but also by the re-writing of the past and selective reporting of the present to suit Big Brother's needs.  Pappas effectively analogizes Big Brother, the fictional ethereal Stalinists in 1984, to Big Corporate, their modern-day nonfictional brothers in totalitarian spirit (albeit from the opposite side of the political extremist spectrum).  By controlling who has access to the public forum, the corporate controllers of media select all the political candidates before elections are ever held.  By deciding who gets to speak they decide who gets to run (see Dennis Kucinich for a working example of how this operates).

This is a successful effort to counter corporate propaganda and censorship.  It does so with a comprehensive and dizzying assortment of facts, issues, and viewpoints, which, whether new to the viewer or a memory jolt, never should have been removed from the public radar screen.",1196208000,5,3670,5.365853658536586

2256974,5,B0008237AA,"This review is not organized, but my thoughts are here. ""Orwell Rolls"" is a documentary without the cant and cuteness the mass audience may expect after Michael Moore's productions. (And really, who's seen more than a couple other documentaries? Which is partly to say we should have, which is also TO THE POINT: If we don't [a] get the Sundance channel and [b] watch it regularly, we will miss many worthwhile and informative, even essential films [unless we search them out online]. If our cable provider doesn't supply Sundance, that's because its owner would rather we don't watch it. Ah, but I do digress....) The sound is desperately uneven; beyond that, I can't think of anything to criticize.

News Flash: The corporate giants have acquired first the politicians (campaign money) and then monopolistically consolidated the media (through not ""de-"" but RE-regulation) in ever fewer hands. Among the few nuggets of good news, this film documents how the Senate overruled the FCC's reconfiguration of the rules regarding corporate ownership of newspapers and TV outlets in 2003.

What is ESSENTIAL here: The film documents how corporate control limits your access to information, because their interests can determine what stories and what persons are exposed to the public through the media they own. You get the barest flavor of what stories you have probably missed, thanks to this consolidation. In addition, you are challenged to realize that, although for now this lack is made up for by the Internet and the myriad underground sources of information there, the situation may soon change when the corporations move through the FCC to limit digital access to the channels and constituencies that suit their interests; same song, third verse (first verse was the disastrous ""deregulation"" of radio ownership).

-- Related BOOK recommendation: ""Unequal Protection"" by Thom Hartmann. It culminates in practical steps (proposed laws and amendments) to curtail the overweening power of corporations, protected by law as ""persons"" although immortal and immeasurably wealthy. They are able to contest legal action until any private citizen is impoverished and retires from the fray.

A century ago, during the ""Gilded Age"" of the first giant monopolies, the Sullivan Act took a stand against the oligarchs, the robber barons; history is cycling back around, only with greater concentrations of resources and potentially calamitous results. People, we must hear and act, not just because the government is accountable to us but because our democracy is in trouble. Every act in the right direction is significant. Don't be discouraged, and don't be deceived!",1193961600,3,2660,5.311163895486936
2256975,3,B0008237AA,"This documentary is even more appropriate and must-see now as I write this, with Rupert Murdoch trying to buy the Wall Street Journal, a paper he complains has articles that are too long, i.e., have too many facts.

I gave the DVD only 3 stars because it uses images and interviews in a repetitive way in order to get an emotional response out of the viewer.  And some of the numbers casually thrown around are suspect.

But the overall message is hard to deny:  the media failed to cover Bush's insider trading scandal that should have put him in prison instead of being awarded the 2000 election.  It failed to cover Gov Jeb Bush's disqualification of 57000, mostly black, votes in 2000, on the grounds they were ex-cons and not qualified to vote.  (The BBC later investigated and said this charge was a crock.)  It failed to cover the issues raised in Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 911"". And so on.

The real scary part, though, is that the voting machines used in the US are supplied by companies associated with the Republican Party, and these companies keep secret how the machines actually count votes.  The doc also notes that machines have switches that control how the ballots are read that have been set differently in different precincts.

And then the doc leaves the viewer with an echo of 1984 and Big Brother's permanent state of war against changing enemies.  Yesterday the enemy was Osama bin Laden, then without missing a beat the enemy became Saddam Hussein, and tommorow?  Hugo Chavez?

2256982,5,B0008237AA,"It was 1948 when British author George Orwell's alarming view of life in the future was presented in the chilling novel ""1984.""  Orwell inverted the last two numbers as he wrote about a society existing 36 years into the future.

Robert Kane Pappas brings the story forward 20 years to 2004, when his penetrating documentary ""Orwell Rolls in His Grave"" was released.  This is the year of a presidential contest between two former Yale University Skull and Bones members that resulted in what serious experts who have carefully studied the November presidential election concluded was a stolen result.

It is to be noted that rigged elections have been an active part of election machinery in dictatorships.  Pappas' film represents a stern warning about what would culminate that November, followed quickly by Skull and Bonesman John Kerry conceding to George W. Bush, later explaining that he did not want to be perceived as a ""sore loser.""

The Kerry ""explanation"" reeked of absurdity on its face.  Four years earlier two deciding votes of the Federalist Society wing of the U.S. Supreme Court ""installed"" Bush as the nation's chief executive after thousands of African Americans in Florida had been denied the right to vote and Al Gore had secured more popular votes than his rival.

It should also be noted that Bush secured the inside track to ""victory"" due to the efforts of Fox News, which got out front in declaring him the winner early Wednesday morning while ballots continued to be counted and the deciding Florida electoral votes were anything but an apparent Republican certainty.

What is Fox but a purveyor of ""doublespeak"" in the most discernible sense?  It masquerades in the form of a news station and trumpets the neoconservative line, regularly receiving Republican National Committee talking points and acting upon them according to former employees.  Who made the projection for Bush?

The Fox operative heading the projection desk and making the call was John Ellis, cousin of the candidate.  There was scarcely a word written about this telling fact in the mainstream outlets.

By being the perceived winner as the other networks followed Fox's lead and also projected Bush as triumphant, Republicans were able to showcase their candidate as the ""winner"" and paint Democrats calling for a recount as ""sore losers"" who should ""get over it"" and accept a Republican ""victory.""

Had George Orwell been on the scene to report the election and its long and laborious aftermath he would have sharply focused on all of the aforementioned.  The mainstream media's timidity to report the actual story as it unfolded is a classic example of Orwell's dire pronouncements of news reporting being eviscerated by propaganda.

This documentary covers what occurred in 2000, including the hiring of two of Chief Justice Scalia's son and daughter to work for the Bush Administration after the election.  Associate Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, during the same period when the Bush vs. Gore case was being deliberated, was gathering resumes for potential Bush appointees for the right wing political think tank, the Heritage Foundation.

In addition, Scalia's lawyer son, who would shortly thereafter receive a Bush appointment, worked for the same firm as the lawyer arguing the case for George W. Bush in Bush vs. Gore, Theodore Olson, who would later be selected by Bush to serve as Solicitor General, the government's chief trial lawyer.

Did Scalia and Thomas have a duty to recuse themselves from the case due to a potential conflict of interest?  In traditional legal canons of ethics the answer is yes, but these are no ordinary times.

Both Scalia and Thomas were members of the right wing Federalist Society, which Dick Cheney would later choose as his forum to announce that he was intent on going ""full speed ahead"" against Iraq.  But then, Theodore Olson was also a member of the Federalist Society!

Could we have an actual conspiracy here?  If George Orwell were alive today he would be citing this Federalist Society link.  He would also be writing about Skull and Bones, which featured so prominently in the 2004 election.

Orwell would also point out how the mainstream media has poisoned needed investigation into such areas as secret and quasi-secret organizations and their influence on national and international government policies.

He would focus on the ridiculing by the mainstream media of those who dare to ask such questions by frequently labeling them as kooks advancing absurd ""conspiracy theories.""

A high point of Pappas' film is Greg Palast explaining that after he uncovered the Republican scam of Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris to ""scrub"" eligible voters, primarily of African American descent, from Florida's voters' rolls under the guise of eliminating felons from voting, that no American news outlet would broadcast or print his story.  To receive any kind of eventual hearing or reading Palast was compelled to tap a foreign source with Britain's BBC.

Media expert Robert McChesney discusses the move toward entertainment replacing information within the mainstream media and makes an essential point in commenting on how Republican propagandists, led by framing expert Frank Luntz, use a modification of Orwell's ""doublespeak"" to mislabel political efforts.  An effort to terminate protection through environment enforcement is labeled as a plan to ""save the environment.""

Then Congressman and currently Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont provides an anecdote in the same vein.  He explains that what Republicans, with Luntz framing, describe as the ""death tax"" is actually an estate tax that encompasses only the wealthiest top 1 percent of Americans.

Sanders cites a personal example illustrating how the Luntz Republican framing strategy has confused elements of the citizenry.  As he was walking down a Vermont street Sanders was confronted by an angry constituent.

The man told Congressman Sanders that he was angry at him for not allowing this constituent to leave a relatively small amount of money to his son upon his death without the government stopping him.  Sanders then explained that the law had no effect on this citizen or any than the top 1 percent.

Michael Powell is showcased as a Federal Communications Commissioner siding with corporate monopoly in the media.  Powell was asked about the future of digital rights, meaning the status of the Internet and efforts to prevent it from being taken over by a corporate conglomerate such as Clear Channel, which currently controls the lion's share of the nation's radio stations.

""I'd like a Mercedes but I can't afford one,"" Powell replied, skirting the issue.  Did the answer result from feigned or real ignorance?  After all, Powell left enough clues that the corporate media giants are in charge of the FCC.

The issue of so many commentators and reporters acting as rubber stamps of major corporations was examined through the perspective of iron clad control of lobbyists over the current political process.

One of the most fascinating as well as revealing scenes of Pappas' film relates to a huge line outside a Washington office.  It is explained that lobbyists pay line sitters to hold their places in lengthy queues.

The acute interest of lobbyists and their wealthy employers in the government process is far from academic and decidedly commercial.

Orwell would be fastening microscopic attention on the lobbying process and its astounding results were he alive today.  As this film emphasizes, how dearly we miss him.",1170720000,11,7548,5.167763157894737

This documentary uses contemporary and entertaining authors, journalists and speakers, like Michael Moore and Bernie Sanders, to describe the trends in the media and why we are getting dumber...since the information we are receiving about the rest of the world is filtered carefully to remove things that ""they"" don't want us to know.

From the personal side, I thought the movie was going to be alarmist and overblown, instead it seemed composed, yet edgy and definitely entertaining. How I watch the tube will never be the same again...literally. I found myself watching news and movies with a sardonic discontent.

2256985,4,B0008237AA,"This is a powerful and convincing documentary that claims the media is not reporting the news so much as it is reporting what media moguls say is the news. Pappas also draws a parallel between today and what happened in George Orwell's 1950 classic, ""1984."" Only this time it is conservative forces, not Stalinists, controlling the message. There are several examples to support the producer's assertion.

In the presidential race of 2000 Al Gore was a called a liar many times during the campaign for things he did not say, but were attributed to him. On the other hand, Mr. Bush lied several times, but was never challenged on some real whoppers. For example, Bush claimed that as Governor of Texas, the state now had the finest health care program in the country. (He left out that he vetoed the bill twice, and left it on his desk unsigned.)

The investigative journalist, Gregory Pallast found a list of ninety some thousand people who were listed as felons in Florida where it is illegal for them to vote. Only most of them were not felons, but were African American (who usually voted democrat.) Over 57,000 people were denied their constitutional right. Compared to white counties, the list was almost nill. Pallast, who is also an economist, claimed this would be a statistical impossibility. But then, Florida's secretary of state was Katherine Harris, who was also working for the Bush campaign. (Conflict of interest here?) Pallast offered the story to CBS who did not run it because, they said, they had checked with the governor's office and Katherine Harris, who claimed it wasn't true. A story of this magnitude got very little press--in the US.

There are perhaps five or six conglomerates that now control what Americans will see or hear as news compared to the hundreds of large and small news varieties that readers could choose from even twenty years ago. The message according to Pappas reflects the political views of the moguls, moguls such as Rupert Murdoch, right-wing advocate. This monopoly was allowed to occur when Ronald Reagan repealed several regulations that guaranteed ""fair and balanced"" (Whoops, sorry!). A price we are paying for more and more each day.

Pappas asserts that without a free press. or a press that is not allowed to pursue real news, Americans are losing more freedom on a daily basis and are under an illusion that they live in a democracy. Add to this average American disinterest in how their government operates and how the press manipulates them. As the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebels said, ""Repeat a lie often enough, and people will take it as fact.""

If you wish to delve deeper into these topics, I urge you to read, ""Armed Madhouse..."" and ""The Best Democracy Money can Buy,"" ""Lapdogs"" by Boehlert, ""Fraud... by Waldman, ""Moyers on America"" and Helen Thomas'latest book about the White House Press Corps.

This story presents facts. It is a good starting point for anyone developing an interest in our press and its politics. Anyone who may claim that this work is bogus, has to be in denial. And there's plenty of that going around these days.

They are too busy watching Fox News and listening to talk radio.

It's about how the media is biased because it's owned by Corporate America. How deregulation by the Telecommunications Act hurts our nation. They are buying up the small independent stations. Corporate America and the Republicans would love to regulate the internet because there is too much information they prefer we didn't know. They will try to use some pseudo-intellectual reason to censor the internet by euphemist language (like they did with Patriot Act) to brainwash the unquestioning citizens in our country.

2256987,5,B0008237AA,"As per the title, the movie highlights/compares the warnings found in Orwell's dystopian book 1984 with what is presently occurring in the United States and probably elsewhere.

Basically the premise is that a few large private corporations are forming a global monopoly to control all forms of media communication: the internet, television, newspapers, radio stations, magazines, advertising....and when this wealthy uber minority finally controls all global communication, they can then completely control people's opinions and ultimately the government by controlling access to information and media exposure. They will control people's opinion by selectively feeding the people only ""fair and balanced"" information that the people ""can trust"". The ideas presented in the film are nothing new to educated free thinking people, but these ideas may help others who are blind to this developing/worsening threat.

Speakers in the film also remind us that so far the internet temporarily remains the last relatively unconstrained media outlet for the small journalist only because it so new and the uber meister's well paid minions haven't figured out how to completely control it yet. The producer/speakers hope that the ""vegged out masses"" will stand up and argue/fight for a change to a true pluralistic democracy- and not just for the choice of republican or democrat. Mentioned are good examples of Nazi propaganda ideology, the manipulation methods the media uses for information control, political control, and techniques of ""spin"" illustrated with recent political events.

On a similar note, a good current example of this media bias/blackout (unfortunately this example is not in the film) is the so called ""energy crisis"" that has been popular off and on in the U.S. news for decades. Many people in different countries have witnessed and reported on permanent magnet/ pulsed electromagnet based electrical generators (the so called ""overunity or free energy"" machines), but this critical information- the inexpensive, pollution-free solution to the energy crisis- has not (and probably will not) be allowed by the uber meisters to be discussed in national U.S. news media like Fox or CNN news.

This documentary makes you question what is the true extent of how we are being psychologically manipulated and herded by the interests of private corporations? It also clearly points out why a mainstream, open public access media system is so critical in a real democracy- otherwise we will all soon live in societies completely controlled by faceless global corporations and corrupt politicians that are only interested in the power and comfort of the very,very few.

2256994,5,B0008237AA,"The reviews here are all GREAT! I cannot say anything better than other reviews about this MUST OWN DVD. I agree that this DVD should be distributed to EVERY single American household. Our Nation is being sold down the river and this DVD is proof. All facts presented are indisputable and iron clad.

Its too late to save this great Nation and this DVD is proof of that. The American People are too conditioned to believe whatever party they follow. Neocons (Bush Republicans) and True Republicans (Reagan Republicans) are programmed to believe that whatever bad thing is said about their leaders is a Liberal Bias Lie. A Democrat or Liberal is programmed to believe that whatever bad thing is said about their leaders is a Right Wing Conspiracy. Both sides miss the point completely because it is all about Corporations control over the media and influence. Who can own the biggest most broad based corporation. AOL-Internet. Time Magazine. Warner Brothers. AOL Time Warner. A company that has a stake in movies, music, magazines, and the Internet. Thats just the most basic example. (Ever wonder why there are SO MANY commercials on TV?) I don't have enough room here to get into other HUGE media outlets, but you get the point. This DVD goes into that aspect and presents it in every detail.

Until a few days ago I used to think people who thought the Government was *Out to get them* were a couple cans short of a six pack. But now...I don't know. In light of our present Government...who just happen to be Republicans...a coincidence...I'm sure. Nevermind that our Government is SPYING on everyday American Citizens. Bush got caught spying on everyday normal US Citizens. Wow. Now, I don't believe Bush is sitting there listening into conversations. No, he authorized the act. There's just too many questionable things that have happened on W's watch, since 2001.

Here are some quotes that can refer to our current Governments policies, but are from Nazi leaders:

""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it"". Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.

""Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for LACK of patriotism and exposing the Country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY COUNTRY"". Herman Goering Nazi Marshall.

Hmm...Fox News has a morning show that has a live audience. Today Fox was asking their audience if it was OK that the Bush Regime was spying on them. The answer, was of course, predictable. A resounding yes. But what is really scary about that is these answers came from normal, every day, American Citizens. Nevermind politics. Nevermind Right or Left, these are American Citizens saying it's OK that the Government spies on them.

It's easy to say that these Americans are blinded by their beliefs. Its easy to say that the Sean Hannitys, Ann Coulters, and Bill O Reillys of the world keep these Americans in line. Keep them in line by spouting hate and anyone who disagrees with them is a card carrying Liberal. Keep em divided. Its easy to say that the Government keeps them in fear. Keeps them in line by thinking they are being protected when their basic rights are under attack. But to actually SEE these lost souls is another thing.

Indeed, it IS too late to save this Country. You can only hope to slow the inevitable. Pick up a copy of this DVD or rent it, but whatever you do...SEE THIS DOCUMENTARY. Not only is Orwell rolling in his grave but also our Founding Fathers.

True, it's depressing and leaves the viewer with a sense of frustration and rage...but should also inspire everyone to become determined to do anything in his/her power to work for independent media in this country.

Even though corporate ownership controls to a great extent everything we see and hear over the airwaves today, there are alternatives which are experiencing promising growth every day.  Conservative talk radio in the form of Rush Limbaugh and right-wing TV with its FOX Network talking heads (Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity, among others) are the undisputed ""giants"" who control the media markets throughout the nation, but do not underestimate the younger, smaller, but up and coming progressive radio and TV programs which have been gaining in popularity in the past year or two.

Air America Radio, which features such progressives as Al Franken, Randi Rhodes, Sam Seder and Janeane Garofalo, among others, Ed Schultz (from the Jones Network), and the brilliant, award-winning Amy Goodman with her co-host, Juan Gonzalez, on Democracy Now!, both on her web site (with streaming video) as well as on TV in some markets on public access or PBS stations...all are making strides in reporting the truth every day.  Most of the above named radio hosts have written books, and many of their programs may be accessed via the Internet.

If your town doesn't have a radio station that carries progressive talk, then do as others (including myself) have done: organize your own grass-roots group, scout around for a station that has low or sinking ratings, and approach the manager with the idea of bringing one or more of the progressive talk programs to their station.  Don't think it can't be done!  If a group of four (then six) women who had never been activists in their lives could accomplish this, then anyone can!  It might not happen overnight, but it could happen.

2256996,5,B0008237AA,"This wonderful documentary elegantly and succintly 'connects the dots' on why America today - is America. If you are annoyed by political correctness,  here are the modern roots of it - though 'double speak' certainly goes back much further in time (See comments at end). Only with more powerful technology is the impact more prevalent.

The premise, using Orwell's 1984 as a pre-text, is that concentrated media control has a large influence on people's opinions. The many channels and stations available are just an illusion. This reminds me of William Randolph Hearst's influence on popular opinion which I read about at Hearst Castle in California. I've followed many indy websites on media concentration, but even in my darkest imagination did I suspect it could be this bad.

The video also notes the threat of control on the Internet, but worse yet I think, is the self-sustaining feedback look that the web allows. Like minds are often attracted to like minds. But - if those minds are filled with incestuous ideas....

Far from being 'partisan' - there are plenty of 'shots' at ""Republicans"", and one of the exposes on the video is the Telecommunications Act of 1996, passed during the 'Clinton Years' when many were too busy (And still are) enriching themselves to see the long term danger.

I recommend Animal Farm on DVD. While some may think that Animal Farm only applies to Communism, I'd say look again, its just a matter of time at the present rate. You don't get equality and peace by rooting for equality and peace. You must get to the root cause - see end of review.

This is another video I place in a special category of DVDs that should be mass distributed for free, like the Bible. Others include the Journey of Man, BBC's Blue Planet, and National Geographic's Strange Days on Planet Earth.

As for what to do - check out - approvalvoting.org - one way out of this mess is to move past an ideology that sees things in black and white. We need more parties and viewpoints, as one of the clips so notably highlights. 300 million people, with just two main state/federal level political parties that increasingly look like each other....hmm...

I also recommend learning more about Scandinavia and Vermont (Doh - Howard Dean!). If you haven't traveled internationally, go! Build conviction and see different ways of political organization and life. There are better ways!  3/4+ of Americans don't even have a passport - from the US State Department passport statistics.

Pure capitalism/corporatism doesn't reward wisdom the same way it does for  'intelligence' / IQ. That is a mistake. I recommend the book -- Native Wisdom for White Minds.

Of most importance though: The ultimate doublespeak is - the lies we tell ourselves. SELF-DECEPTION.

I *HIGHLY* recommend the book - WHY WE LIE: The Evolutionary Roots of Deception and the Unconscious Mind by David Livingstone Smith.

8055353,2,B0008237AA,"Let's be honest, the only people that will like this film are either extreme far left ideologues, people who  misinformed or uniformed about events or those who are easily led/propagandized. This film could have been so much better if only the maker could have stayed away from ridiculous conspiracy theories and looked at the problems with the media from an unbiased perspective. But he didn't instead he surrounded himself with some of the most unreliable and most ideologically people so all you get is an echo chamber of like minded propaganda.

Here are just some of my notes:

Mark Crispen Miller tried to tell us that the 24/7 news coverage during the 2000 Florida vote counting debacle didn't happen. And then chillingly he said that IF the media ""crafted"" the correct story Bush would not have been elected. HUH - Wasn't this whole documentary about comparing today's media with that of Orwell's 1984 propaganda. And wasn't it suppose to be warning us of Media maniuplation. Instead we have one of the main commentators in the documentary championing the Media ""crafting"" a story to help change election outcomes - scary, very scary if you ask me.

When the documentary starts talking about the issues in the 2000 Florida election we can immediately see the far left bias of people the filmmaker relies on. No matter whose side you are on the fact that the Gore camp used the win-at-any-cost mentality was plain to see and the attempts of the Media to show some sort of false equivalency between the Democrats wanting to change the election rules after the vote, refusing to recount all the ballots and wanting to exclude overseas and absentee ballots and the Bush camp which wanted to follow the rules was also startling. I didn't vote for Bush in 2000 but watching the shameless shenanigans of the Democrats certainly turned my stomach against Gore. I must admit though, watching the Democratic Party mobilize and getting its message out and repeated ad nauseam by the press and its followers was quite impressive, Goebbels would have been proud.

The Documentary made this claim: ""five months before the 2000 election, Governor Jeb Bush moved to purge 57,000 people from the voting rolls""

Actually it was Kathleen Harris that was mandated to do this by LAW. This Law had been on the books before Harris and Bush were even born. The documentary then went on to quote Greg Palast, a self-described Sam Spade who in reality worked for England's Equivalent of The National Enquirer. Palast claimed that over 54,000 voters were wrongly removed from the list and he proof that over 8,000 disenfranchised voters were complaining that they couldn't vote and rather conveniently ALL of them wanted to vote for Gore. The reality is that over $3 million dollars was spent by democratic operatives canvassing Florida during the recounting phase and they found less than 10 people who had verifiable claims and Palast to date has not provided a grand total of 3 people from his list of 8,000. When CBS, which was strongly biased for Gore heard of this they sent a team in to report, when they contacted the DNC and said they were leading off with this story the DNC told them they shouldn't since it will come out later on that it's not true and they could not find any evidence of this. However the documentary is putting forth this story as true and that ""CBS News killed the story on the basis of denial by Governor Jeb Bush""

Not surprisingly this so-called documentary backs the ironically Orwellian named ""Fairness Doctrine"". This doctrine will actually constrain media outlets from reporting on news stories by forcing them to give equal time to other side. In other words, report on climate change and you need a response from climate change deniers, report on a evolutionary find and you get a response from creationists, report on pollution and you get a equal response from the polluters. On top of that they want to go back to the old rules that forbid competition in the marketplace. Only a select few corporations were given a license for say NYC, you got this license through lobbying and paying off politicians and the selections process was rife with corruption but they forget to mention that. Now anyone can apply for license and get it and present the news thereby increasing competition and voices from all over the political spectrum but for some Orwellian reasoning the documentary presents this as bad thing that limits out choice. However the facts are in and the news viewer today has more choices than they did when the fairness doctrine was in full swing. Right or wrong you can get news slated from the left, center and right. You can tune into channels that show ignored news stories, and of course we have a much broader spectrum of news being reported than the highly sanitized reports of the 70's. Those are indisputable facts but the documentary shows 4 people claiming the exact opposite. What proof do they have for their claims, nada, zilch, Zippo, only  the hot air emanating from their nether regions.

After we go through the last ""through the looking glass"" story we are then assaulted with the Harken inside trading story which was another specious allegation that had zero facts, data or evidence to back it up. Although it was magically brought to light 4 month before the election by a unknown ""news source"" it soon showed it true stripes. It was nothing more than a desperate attempt by a far-left independent media group to sway the election, most sensible media outlets wouldn't touch the story because there was no evidence of wrong-doing.  This particular case was pushed through the SEC quickly by the Clinton Administration but even their investigators admitted that they couldn't find any wrong doing. The bottom line is Bush sold shared of stocks he held in Harken Energy when he left the firm, a  very usual practice. He used the proceeds to pay off the loan he taken for his share in the Texas Rangers that he had just purchased and this was the reason he left Harken. Harken's stock price started to drop slowly several months later and finally bottomed out a year AFTER Bush sold. However the next year the stock recovered in price to DOUBLE what Mr. Bush had sold it for making the accusations that Bush bailed before the firm went belly up laughably untrue. But don't believe me, this is from wikipedia:

""The SEC's exhaustive investigation examined thousands of pages of documents. Additionally, and in an unusual move, Mr. Bush waived client-attorney privileges so the attorneys could be questioned, with no doubts remaining on the subject. Regarding whether Mr. Bush knew in advance about the losses, the SEC investigators found: ""The evidence establishes that George W. Bush was not aware of the majority of the items that comprised the loss Harken announced on August 20."" The SEC investigators concluded that the loss resulted from write-downs and expenses that occurred after he sold his stock.""

And then to add insult to injury the documentary tried to rewrite history of the 2000 presidential campaign. It was pretty obvious that the major news media outlets were in the tank for Gore. They soft-pedaled all sorts of stories that could have hurt Gore while relentlessly attacking Bush and trying to tar him with everything they thought they could get away with. Dan Rather went so far as to go on the air with known forged documents and lie to the American people to help Gore. As we all know Dan Rather had to resign in shame after he used his news pedestal to try to sway the election but this documentary doesn't even mention this. Instead it claims Gore was the victim of the Media and Bush got a free ride - hmmmmmm, who had to resign over a fabricated Anti-Gore story????????

Could it get any worse - Yes, this film was done in 2005 but it still brings up the thoroughly debunked Reagan conspiracy theory led by the disgraced Gary Sick who was fired by Carter from his team. Even Carter himself said Sick's theory was nothing more than a amateur conspiracy theory that had no evidence behind it. It should be noted that Sick was ridiculed by commentators on both the right and left his allegations and subsequent book. Two separate congressional investigations, led by Democrats, have looked into the charges and both unanimously concluded that there was NO plan to delay the hostages' release. Some of the most damning testimony against this theory came from none other than Gary Sick himself, one of his biggest claims was the George HW Bush was in Paris attending high level meetings when in fact there are multiple videos of Bush Campaigning in the US at numerous stops on the day before, of and day after the claim. Both Newsweek  and the very left-wing  New Republic did very long investigative reports on this issue, even highlighting on both of their covers. But even with their liberal bias they had to conclude that there was NO evidence to back up Sick's claim. In fact virtually every major news organization went after this story and all came to the same conclusion. The bottom line is most sensible people during this era wrote off this aberrant conspiracy theory as being just a byproduct of someone who was ""sick"" in their head.

After this I just gave up on this film, at first it was like a bad car wreck, tragically wrong but hard to look away from. After rehashing this last ludicrous conspiracy theory that only the extreme of extreme whack-a-do's would hold on to I just had to give up.",1377734400,2,9485,4.791437308868502

We have powerful propaganda media controlling what we see and how we perceive it. It's a 5 star film with interviews, footage of actual F.C.C. voting and hearings. Interviews with politicians such as Senator Bernie Sanders and journalists such as Greg Palast as well as dozens of professors of major universities on media broadcasting producers of Faux news to 60 minutes....

8055355,4,B0008237AA,"Although this documentary was released in 2003, and focuses on events of that era to punctuate its thesis: that the major Media operates fully under a dominating storyline framed by the corporate interests and indeed politicians buttressed by them that has the affect of supporting a corporate State.....and blinding us to any other political reality or possibility.  There are persuasive arguments about how tenacious these walls are and how narrow and self-serving.  Though the film can take no awards for its cinematography, basically most of the shots are of men sitting at their desks talking to you, at you....nevertheless it is extremely affective cumulatively and the affect subliminally gives you a better perspective on the news that is coming at you day by day....as you are implicitly invited to consider an alternative and wider possibility.  Plus, as the main news event that is used as reference for a controlled story, is the 2000 presidential election between Bush and Gore, and that  there is another election on the horizon with all kinds of shenanigans underfoot to change to rules, mood and districting, to affectively maintain the corporate agenda, it is a timely film to revisit to have your antenna sharpened for the shenanigans afoot.",1317081600,3,1259,5.187192118226601
