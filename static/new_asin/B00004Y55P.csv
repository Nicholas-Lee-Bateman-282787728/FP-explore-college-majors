I'd say there's about 15 minutes of actual climbing footage. Add this to the fact that the 1975 American expedition failed in it's attempt of the NE ridge , and it's just not that entertaining. Where in God's name is the documentary about the successfull 1978 American ascent ?",1352764800,,434,4.506329113924051
7926540,3,B00004Y55P,"In 1975 Jim and Lou Whittaker led a team of American climbers to attemt K2, the 2nd highest peak on Earth, in Pakistan. The real story (told in more than one book) is that the climbers ended up bickering so badly with one another the cohesion of the team fell apart and they never got very far up the peak. That story is not even mentioned in this film. Instead, Steve Marts concentrated on the then foreign Pakistani and Balti cultures, and the story of the approach and attempted climb (aborted half way up the peak. A line still unclimbed to this day). After starting well, the film covers territory better told in other films. And while Steve Marts is one of the best mountain filmakers and cinematographers in history, even he couldn't pull a rabbit out of his hat here. After a good start (and a few spectacular shots of K2 from the air) just like the climb itself, the film drags on and fizzles at the end.
I would first recommend Fairweather & Ascent, and Everest: North Wall, if looking for films by Steve Marts. Both of those carry my highest recommendation.",975715200,2,1068,4.510309278350515
