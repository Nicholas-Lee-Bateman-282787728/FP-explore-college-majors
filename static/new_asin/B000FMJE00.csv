8141520,5,B000FMJE00,"Directed by Aristide Massaccesi (Joe D'Amato). DEATH SMILES ON MURDER (Death Smiled at Murder)(1972) is the only film that directer Joe D'Amato acually used his real name as the director. Before Joe D'amato began filming softcore and hardcore films he was a cinematographer and director for a couple very effective Gialli (WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO SOLANGE, THE KILLER IS ON THE PHONE) and Horror films (THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT).

Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) was born on December 15, 1936, in Rome and died in Rome, Italy because of a heart attack.

The last film that D'Amato was working on before his death was a movie called PLANKTON (1995). That was supposed to be about a group of young divers that become infected with a 'virus' which results in rape and bloody mayhem.

 Here he directs Klaus Kinski and gorgeous Ewa Aulin in this wild story of a man who uses an ancient Incan formula to raise the dead and uses it for his own series of revenge murders. Bizarre, surreal and at times incomprehensible, this D'Amato film (which he also scripted) is full of hypnotic scenes and strong scenes of violence.",1170979200,,1114,4.786458333333333
