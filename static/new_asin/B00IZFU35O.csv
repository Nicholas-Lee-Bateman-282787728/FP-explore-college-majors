8646809,1,B00IZFU35O,"I'm a big fan of Scandinavian Noir but I thought this series contained the most convoluted screenplay that I have ever seen. It was almost impossible to keep track of the innumerable characters and their affiliations not to mention the sketchy information about the secret society underlying the story. Can't understand how it got such good reviews. Compared to Borgen, The Bridge, and The Legacy, I really thought it was a loser. Sorry I wasted my time and money.",1475020800,,464,4.886075949367089
8646810,4,B00IZFU35O,"I'm a big fan of the Scandinavian noir genre and this is a good offering. According to my very subjective yardstick, Mammon gets 4 stars (with The Bridge getting 5 for pure knock-your-socks-off excellence). Why? Because though Mammon is compelling, intense, and very well-acted, it is often hard to follow. I'll try not to give away too much here, but the plot involves a lot of intricate financial shenanigans at the highest levels of Norwegian government and business. If you have seen the Belgian series Salamander (and if you haven't, you should), you will notice that the plot is rather similar. However, in Mammon, it's harder to know what is going on.  I spent much of the time feeling rather lost -- perhaps that is part of the point.  The protagonist, a first-rate investigative journalist, is also blundering about, so I guess it's okay that the audience is, too -- but that can make for a frustrating viewing experience.  It isn't simply the more arcane elements of Norwegian finance that are to blame for some of the confusion-- they often use trusts instead of public corporations, for example, thus giving only a few trustees a great deal of power -- and that point is relevant to understanding what is going on. Additionally, the inter-relationships of many of the characters are unclear.  I'm not sure if some of it is literally lost in the translation, but a number of puzzling interactions occur that make one wonder what one has missed.  And speaking of translations, the subtitles seemed, more than once, to have had some errors.  And, no, I do not speak Norwegian, so I cannot attest to linguistic accuracy, but in several places, the English subtitles did not make sense given the action on screen. The acting is really the most powerful element of this series, in my opinion, and the force of it draws one in.",1468281600,,1832,4.781645569620253

8646814,4,B00IZFU35O,"The protagonist of this series starts off somewhat unlikable, but that quickly changes. There is a slow development as to what is ""really"" going on but that's not a bad thing. There's a relatively high body count and one or two somewhat farfetched coincidences, but all in all it's a watchable series and definitely worth a recommendation. The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars from me is that there are some others that deserve the rating a little more. (Side note - I apologize for all previous recommendations that were posted before I understood how to do this!)",1434153600,3,568,4.747474747474747
