8162631,3,B000LP4ZQY,".. this is the 1962 movie with English subtitles.  While the 2012 film deals with the entire war, this film just deals with a few naval skirmishes.  The captain hero of this film is chosen by the people to defend China from the foreigners (Japan, the US, and to a lesser extent, the UK) in 1894.  He has real problems doing this, however, as all of the other Chinese leaders are taking bribes from the West or are cowards.  He encounters the Japanese flagship YOSHINO (really just a small British-built cruiser) a few times and consistently beats the crap out of it with his spunky crew.  (It turns out that the YOSHINO can't maneuver very well due to the HUGE ridiculous NELSONESQUE uniform worn by its cowardly commander.).  Our hero is unable to sink the YOSHINO, however, since it actually survived the war, so he is sunk trying to ram her by the rest of the Japanese cruiser fleet and goes to a hero's rest at the bottom of the sea.",1498694400,,937,4.450292397660819
