8034058,5,B0002X7GW0,"I love gangster films and this was definitely one of the best I've ever seen. It's also one of my favourites by Wong Kar Wai, you can really see how good a director and storyteller he is even if this is his first feature film.
It's a very well made film, in particular the cinematography, music and editing are superb and the acting is really good. The story is also compelling and it will keep you wondering what will happen to the characters next. It reminded me a little about Romeo and Juliet, as it is a love story set amid brotherly ties and gang feuds, and Wong Kar Wai used perfectly elements from both Western and Eastern cultures to reflect upon globalization.
All in all, a masterful film that I keep rewatching regularly. Beware, though, it's pretty violent. Highly recommended!",1402876800,4,790,4.609929078014185

8034060,4,B0002X7GW0,"""As tears go by"" is an interesting and cinematographically beautiful film set in Mongkok, a district in Hong Kong. This movie is directed by Won Kar Wai, an artist that can take a premise and develop it so well that the story he tells turns into reality. In this case, that premise is how to tell the story of a person without a future, of someone that believes that ""People like us don't have tomorrows"". What kind of situation could lead someone to utter such a phrase? If you are interested, just go on reading...

The main character of ""As tears go by"" is Wah (Andy Lau), a well-known Hong Kong mobster that leads a very dangerous life. He is respected and feared, and has only two objectives in life: to stay alive and to take care of his family. That last objective is a little difficult in what concerns to his younger brother Fly (Jackie Cheung), a young man that wants to belong to a triad, but doesn't have what it takes to be respected in a violent environment.

Wah's life consists basically of dodging bullets and getting his little brother out of trouble, until he meets Ngor (Maggie Cheung), a young cousin that needs to stay at his apartment in order to be treated for an illness. Ngor stays with Wah only for some days, but that is more than enough time to make him fall in love with her. But will that love be compatible with the kind of life Wah leads? And when Ngor returns to Kowloon, will Wah follow her?

The answer to those questions and a few more can be found watching ""As tears go by"". If you are interested, go for it! From my point of view, this unconventional ganster movie is worth your time.
