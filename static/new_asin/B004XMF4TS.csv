8447164,5,B004XMF4TS,"This is one of the best Christian kids show ever!!!! its meaningful, thoughtful, funny for kids and parents, and shows simple ways kids can share Jesus! As a mom of 3 young boys I have watched a lot of kids cartoons, this one is great for everyone from my 2 year old to my kids 10 year old friend. Even non christian neighbor kids like it. Its way better than the popular veggie tales. I hope everyone orders this amazing dvd so that author, Scott Cawthon is encouraged to make a sequel!",1422316800,,487,4.304347826086956
