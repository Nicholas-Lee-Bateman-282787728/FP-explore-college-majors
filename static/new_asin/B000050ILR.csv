7928944,5,B000050ILR,"I was looking for this film on dvd with the newly remastered version. this is the film I would like in my collection most of all but why isn't available on dvd? I love this film because it show the venoms acting and dressing contemporary without the ponytails. I hope red sun the video company re-releasing the shaw brothers movies remastering them release this one because the shaw brothers collection isn't complete without them.
I like the magnificent ruffians better then the others. from leon dallas bronx. n.y.",1189209600,,516,4.875
7928945,4,B000050ILR,REALLY GOOD! It compares to Venoms and Golden Arm but this copy is missing the training scenes leadding into the last fight. Other than that butchery of the film it was smooth an consistent!,993168000,,190,4.617647058823529
7928946,4,B000050ILR,"A tale of lies and revenge.  A local Kung fu master hopes to monopolise, but family in his way is protected by a great martial artist.  The evil lord hires 4 local beggars all masters in their own arts (pole, swords, kicking, axe) and tells them lies about the young fighter to sour their feelings on him causing them to challenge him to a duel.  But after countless fights between them they all realize that they are much better friends then enemies, until one of the fighters is sabotaged and kills the young fighter.  Being mistakin for a killer the other 3 turn their backs on him and chase him off swearing revenge until they find out what the real story is.  Amazing weopon work that only the venoms could show you.  Another first class story line, hands down just another great venoms movie period.",992908800,,805,4.517241379310345
7928947,4,B000050ILR,"""Magnificant Ruffians"" is an excellent ensemble genuine Venom flick with all the favorite Venoms cast somewhat differently than what were used to.  This is not a Venom ""costume piece"" with fancy descriptive nicknames.  These Venoms are ""regular"" guys (ruffians)in a refreshing change of pace for a Venom flick.  In fact it takes a little getting used to seeing the Venoms in typical moppy late 70s contemporary ""hair out"" looks as opposed to that slicked down period hairstyle.  The Venoms are in exceptional form, with tight intricate classically Venom fight choreograpy, featuring that beloved familiar ""signature"" Venom strike sound that you just adore.  Lo Meng is slim and trim here with a Bruce Lee like physique.  Watching him here, you wonder why he never achieved the success of a Bruce Lee or others.  I had never seen this movie before though I routinely saw the Venom movies in THEATRES back in the 70s (how many people can say that?).  I also don't recall this movie in the typical Saturday kung fu packages that played throughout the 80s.  So for me, this was a real treat.  The movie was made in 1979, one year after ""Five Deadly Venoms"" and the same year as ""Kid with the Golden Arms"" and the movie rivals them both--- perhaps not nearly as surreal, but still packs a fresh highly engaging non-retread story line.  Additionally, the production quality is extraordinary, with fine, extremely attentive color restorations, rare print imperfections, and excellent sound quality, a fine testament to the so-called ""Limited Collectors Edition.""  Oh yeah, did I mention this is in glorious widescreen?  Need I say more?  Add this to your collection immediately.  (I would actually rate the movie a 4.5)",988070400,2,1712,5.0
7928948,4,B000050ILR,"Set in the second half of the nineteenth century, Lu [Centipede] Feng is a wealthy businessman in an otherwise depressed economy. Looking to expand his enterprises, his clan targets a family run escort service that is protected by the brash Lo [Toad] Mang. When Feng's offers are refused, he pursues a subversive tactic by befriending a group of martial artist vagabonds who indulge in an unorthodox pastime of dining in restaurants and then allowing themselves to be beaten due to lack of money. When these four men (Kuo [Lizard] Chui, Sun [Scorpion] Chien, Chiang [the student] Shang, and Li Wang) develop a pseudo friendship with Mang, it appears that Feng's attempt to acquire the escort service is foiled. Such is not the case as Feng, a martial artist in his own right, has masterminded a deviant scheme which will pit the five comrades against one another.
What makes ""The Magnificent Ruffians"" (aka The Destroyers) stand out against other Venom films is the blending of comedic elements with engaging action sequences. While the Venoms (and director Chang Cheh) have incorporated subtle comedy in other movies, the Stoogesque routine they engage in here will make you laugh out loud. The smoking of cigars, dining at Feng's home, and Sheng's ""fake beating"" sequences are a few of many which allow you to see that these actors are not just martial artist robots.  And speaking of martial arts, where would a Venoms film be without showcasing the cast's excellent skills. Sheng displays a double sword technique and Feng brandishes a gold staff/sword but is Chui's pole skills which are the highlight of this film.
The Venom crew is at their best here and this film ranks along side ""Killer Army,"" ""Unbeatable Dragon,"" ""Crippled Avengers,"" and the original ""Five Venoms.""",982972800,2,1777,5.023728813559322
