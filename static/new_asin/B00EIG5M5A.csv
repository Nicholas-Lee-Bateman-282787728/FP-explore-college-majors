8605720,5,B00EIG5M5A,"This set is Great! I purchased it mostly for the blu-ray movie set alone. I found the special features very informative. I learned a lot! The book of production stills is very well put together and the lithographs are very cool, in fact I'm thinking of framing them (as I will do with my Indiana Jones lithographs). I was a little hesitant about the toys, however when I opened them, I was so impressed with the quality of them I decided not to give them to my son and now have them displayed on my entertainment center!  Coming from Japan, all the packaging was in Japanese, but everything works fine. No Japanese subtitles to contend with.  Very Awesome set for The Dark Knight Fan!",1426896000,,684,4.508064516129032
8605721,3,B00EIG5M5A,"This set is gorgeously packaged, without a doubt, however, it's bonus features are no different than the first edition runs of the original releases. You're paying extra for a box, some exclusive artwork and some Hot Wheels. It's a slight let down considering there are no deleted scenes, new or in depth making of featurettes, retrospectives or interviews. I guess that'll be for the 10th anniversary of the trilogy.",1398643200,,417,5.057971014492754

Everyone who was waiting for this ""Ultimate Collectors Edition"" was hoping for some kind of prop-style set, like the tumbler or the case that houses the bat suit. Instead, what we got is a big white box that can't fit on a shelf with a bunch of ""stuff"" inside.
That being said, I don't dislike the set, I just think it was underwhelming from the perspective of a fan who already purchased the standard trilogy set and was waiting for something spectacular to replace it with.
The set is about the size of a large shoe box, only flatter. The lid has a tendency to separate a bit when its sitting on its side (in display position, I guess), but has never fallen opened on its own. The face of the box is a black and white 3 bat symbol stack, with lots of cracks and broken bits. It looks cool, but, again, is a bit underwhelming. Inside is a letter from Christopher Nolan about the trilogy. An envelope contains 5 character prints from Mondo. Ducard(Ra's Al Gul), The Scarecrow, The Joker, Two-Face, and Bane. Very artistic. Very cool. I have mine up on the wall. Then there's an art book with high quality images from all three movies. Next is a large book containing all the discs. Each spread is devoted to one movie, with a nice representation of each movie on each page. The last page is a bonus disc with a few extra features not contained in the standard set.
Under all that is some foam support and three Hot Wheels cars: The Tumbler, The Batpod, and The Bat. I have those out on display as well. It is a great collection of stuff from the trilogy, and I am happy with my purchase. But if you're not a major Batman fan you might want to save a little money if you already have the movies on blu-ray in some form. If you don't and you want to get everything the movies have to offer, this is a very comprehensive set.",1389571200,3,1888,4.291316526610644

I had very little interest in the character of Batman until The Dark Knight Trilogy came about.  What Nolan did with the trilogy raised the bar for not just superhero movies, but all summer blockbusters in general.  I imagine most people already have seen these films (and perhaps you even own them on blu-ray), so the question before us is as follows: Is the Ultimate Edition worth a purchase?

Well, there are two things that set this collector's edition apart:

1. THE BONUS DISC
This set comes with an exclusive bonus disc, which contains the following:
- The Fire Rises - a 75-minute documentary that looks back at the impact and making-of the trilogy.  It's a great documentary with some behind-the-scenes footage and new interviews, but it is by no means comprehensive.  I feel they are only scratching the surface, and as a big fan of these movies I wanted much more.
- Interview with Christopher Nolan and Richard Donner - these two filmmakers have a discussion about superheroes, and they discuss the influence of Donner's Superman films on Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.
- Original IMAX Footage - all the IMAX scenes from The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.  Scenes are presented in their original aspect ratio, meaning the image is framed exactly as it would be on a real 70mm/15 perf IMAX screen.

2. THE COLLECTIBLES
The Ultimate Collector's Edition includes the following memorabilia:
- Outer Box is labeled Limited Edition and is individually numbered.
- 3 Hot Wheels mini vehicle figures - The Tumbler, the Batpod, and the Bat.
- Hardcover Book, which also serves as the disc storage (the discs do not come in normal blu-ray cases)
- Collectible Booklet w/ images from the films, includes some production photos/concept art.
- 5 Art Cards (measure 7x10 inches) - Ra's al Ghul, Scarecrow, The Joker, Two-Face, and Bane
- Letter from Christopher Nolan (printed on card stock)

So that's it.  There was just enough extra content and collectibles to make this worth a purchase for me.  Still, there are a number of other things I wish were included.  In terms of special features, they're still a bit sparse on making-of videos (especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars bonus material).  How about an in-depth look at filming with IMAX cameras?  And we never got any deleted/extended scenes on any of the blu-ray releases.  As the for collectible items, they are nice (I really like the villains art cards) - but I would say they fall slightly short of the collectibles included in other WB Ultimate sets (such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, etc).

Overall, this set is probably worth it if you are a big fan of the Batman films.  But for casual viewers, the Ultimate Edition can probably be skipped.  I certainly don't regret buying it, but I was left slightly disappointed and would have loved even more content and higher-quality collectibles.",1388102400,5,3365,5.351043643263757
