52609,1,0783226799,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. No one laughed during the hour my group put up with the movie for. The plot and the jokes are just unbearably stupid.

For reference, I found movies like the Naked Gun Airplane, and Rat Race all funny. But I didn't like Anchorman 2, which this film kind of reminds me of because of its stupidity.",1515542400,,339,4.296875

There isn't a week that goes by that either me or my husband don't use a line from this movie in our everyday life.  There are so many!!  And we've been doing that since 1979!  Brilliant!

The price is a. A very fair and when you receive your product. It's always in good condition. In my experience this movie was a cornerstone of my childhood, I watched it endlessly, I cannot say enough good things about this it is about a white man raised by a black family and he thinks he is black until his birthday when they tell him he was not their natural born child. And then he sets off on a grand adventure where he will become rich beyond his wildest dreams and then lose it all. Because he is the jerk.",1498348800,,690,4.007246376811594

With everything from gas station bathrooms to getting out of the bath tub holding a big dog in front of you and a little dog behind you.  And having your name in the phone book.

53003,4,0783226799,"The Jerk (1979) - Dir: Carl Reiner - Amazon Streaming
4 Stars. From acclaimed actor writer, and director funny man, Carl Reiner [Caesars Hour (1954-1957), The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961-1966), Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid (1982), The Man with Two Brain (1983), etc], comes a story by Steve Martin and starred Steve Martin [iThree Amigo! (1986), Roxanne (1987), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), Parenthood (1989), ete]. Much like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in Dumb & Dumber (1994) fifteen years later, Steve Martins Navin is an idiot. Hes a white boy raised by a poor all black family. On his 18th birthday he decides to go out on his own with his dog, S***head. After working at a gas station, where he gives an passing inventor an idea, he makes a life in the carnival where he finds his wife (Bernadette Peters). He soon finds out that his invention has made him millions, which only lasts so long. The movie still holds up with some laugh out loud moments, like when a killer (M. Emmet Walsh) is trying to off Martin and he thinks the killer is after cans or when hes broke and does his famous exit, Well I'm gonna to go then! And I don't need any of this. I don't need this stuff, and I don't need you. I don't need anything. Except this. [Picks up an ashtray.] And that's the only thing I need is this. I don't need this or this. Just this ashtray... And this paddle game. Ultimately most of the comedy is dated for the late 70s, early 80s as one would expect, but its still clever and even vulgar at times. Steve Martin definitely shines in the role and is worth watching just for (pretty much) his comedy on-screen start. Its definitely a comedy of the ages and one that made an impact for things to come.",1446422400,,1743,4.45

I can't really review it, because it's one of those shows you just have to watch. It's back when humor was still funny, without having to be in-your-face dirty or vulgar. It's back when you could joke about race and looks and gender and other 'politically incorrect' things, because it was funny and not really meant to hurt anyone and people didn't get offended over silly little things. It's just good comedy, and I re-watched it with my grown kids the other night and we laughed so hard.",1442880000,4,675,4.578512396694215

53128,4,0783226799,"Steve Martin is hilarious!  And this movie is an example of his great sense of humor and how well he can fit into almost any role when he is given a good script and a good director.  The story is really funny and follows Steve Martin's character from being, ""a poor black child,"" (Yes it's a line from the movie), to a gas station worker, to a circus worker, to an inventor, to a rich man, to a homeless man, and then back to his family home where he started.

My only criticism of this movie was that he wasn't really a jerk in this movie, he's more like an idiot man-child.  He doesn't act like a jerk to anyone, he's just someone who is very quirky and sometimes annoying.

The humor isn't today's humor and it's pretty clean wholesome fun when you watch it.  If you don't like that kind of humor, you probably won't like it.  But if that's your thing, then this is the movie for you.  Check it out!",1427587200,,902,4.173410404624278

53169,4,0783226799,"""The man-child"" has become one of movie and television's most worn-out tropes. Whole careers have risen and fallen almost entirely within its milieu. Adam Sandler has probably played that particular characterthe oblivious adult male with the mind of a mental patient or small child who always gets the girl and usually finds his way into fame and fortune in the processthe longest, and with the most mixed results. But Steve Martin's performance as ""The Jerk"" was one of the first, and it remains one of the best that the subgenre has ever seen. Martin's character really isn't a jerk, at least not the way most people use the word; he's just utterly dense, reacting to each new situation with gleeful incomprehension. Martin is a physical actor, using his long legs and body to dance as dorkily as his ""wild and crazy guy"" character from SNL, but his comic timing is also impeccable. In some of the funniest scenes he uses that sense of timing over a period of minutes, using a technique that's been called ""anti-humor"" in which a joke goes on and on and on until it isn't funny, and then it goes on some more until it becomes funny again. Not everyone can pull it off, but Martin knocks it out of the park twice in this 94 minute movie, both times in monologues delivered to his costar Bernadette Peters. Not every scene is as funny as these, though. The first act, which sets up a surprisingly sweet relationship with his adoptive family from the Mississippi delta, is something to be endured, especially the cheap reliance on racial stereotypes (the worst involves a lowrider). But when the plot finally gets going, the laughs do too.",1423267200,,1638,4.710801393728223

53246,5,0783226799,Classically hilarious. Steve Martian plays the ultimate idiot. It's got some language and handful of scenes not for children. But not as much as today's movies. You will laugh from start to finish.,1395705600,,197,5.0

Criterion says they release important films, well, it doesn't get much more important in terms of comedy films than ""The Jerk"", so DO IT, you won't regret it,, i promise.",1388966400,,744,4.601503759398496

Now with that being said, The Jerk was never visually stunning in the first place however this is the definition of laziness. The grain in many scenes is absolutely out of control, there are numerous dust specs and hairs throughout, and there's quite a few times that you can see splice marks in the film.

It feels like they took the same master they used for the 26th anniversary DVD release and slapped onto a Bluray. If you own the 26th anniversary edition, then there is no reason to buy the Blu edition.",1373587200,9,686,4.4015748031496065

The plot, in which a young abandoned Steve Martin is raised by a stereotyped Negro family in the deep South, leaves home, makes millions on an accidental ""invention,""  is sued, loses everything and then is picked up by his family and goes back to where he was, is weak at best.

53319,4,0783226799,"There was once a time when comedy was taken seriously, as funny as that sounds, comedy was composed of talented and successful actors and comedians. What can most likely be cited as the spawning point for this new renaissance of comedy is probably a show called NBC's Saturday Night. The first few seasons of Saturday Night Live brought the likes of Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Steve Martin (although he was not apart of the cast he hosted in the first season and currently holds the SNL hosting record) and more of the still most iconic and funniest people in the new era of comedy and show business. The Jerk is a hilarious comedy classic with Steve Martin playing one of his famous characters. The story is funny and probably offensive to some, which is partly why it is so funny.

A comedy debuting with an R rating was a risky thing in the 1970's but it was such a hit that movies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers followed right in its path, creating a cult of films like these that are ultimately cemented in the Comedy Movie Hall of Fame. Martin inspired many comedians with this film and many comedy filmmakers were influenced by this film. Although Martin is still active in the film industry and continues to do comedies, as most artists, his best work can be found in his early compositions alongside some of the industries funniest people.

Also there are no special features of any kind which makes it probably wise to wait for a properly restored and remastered version with at least 5.1 surround options to surface in either the standard or Blu-ray formats.

Steve Martin plays a young White man, adopted by a black sharecropping family, who raised him to young adulthood, and, though, frustrated with the fact that he is different from his surrogate family (both, in rhythm, and in other ways), is encouraged to go out and make a life for himself.  Though, this young man is labelled as slow, and, even an idiot, he goes on to become a self-made man, of sorts, finds a beautiful woman he isn't sure what to do with (played by Bernadette Peters), and even patents a prototype of glasses, that won't slip off of  your nose.  (I won't ruin this plot twist for you.)

Steve Martin is at his best, here, with his flare for physical comedy, deadpan delivery and terrific showmanship.  I reccomend this movie to anyone, trying to get acquainted with Martin's body of work, as a comedian and actor.  This is a great place to start!",1137283200,4,1116,4.57286432160804

Especially the delicious Bernadette Peters who steals every scene she's in. Then there's Caitlin Adams in a fantastic bit role as the hard biker chick. And to top it off Jackie Mason is an added treat as the gas station owner who gives Naman little else but a very heavy NY accent. And did I mention Mabel King? Just great as Naman's foster mother. The scene where she is consoling Naman for not being like ""the rest of us"" is just a joy to watch. She is a very gifted actress. And where does Carl Reiner leave off and Steve Martin take over? I guess we'll never know. One thing is for sure.....Carl definitely left his finger prints all over this masterful comedy. I'll go as far to say it's 60% to 40% that Carl is responsible for this collaberation. Yes Steve Martin used to be a very funny man till he decided to become Ward Cleaver, Ozzie Nelson, Fred Mac Murray, and Robert Young rolled into one.

53367,3,0783226799,"The Jerk, a comedy that marked the big screen debut of Steve Martin, is a pretty funny film because of its complete absurdity. It doesn't seek to do anything beyond providing laughs by way of slapstick, and most of the time the jokes are funny, but for a film of this nature to completely succeed, ""most of the time"" is not enough.

Navin R. Johnson (Martin) grew up as a member of a black family in Mississippi, but after finding out that he was adopted, he decides he needs to get out and see the world. Navin makes his way to St. Louis, where he gets a job at a gas station, working for Harry Hartounian (Jackie Mason). Soon enough, Navin has to run from a madman sniper (M. Emmet Walsh) who has selected him at random as his victim.

Navin ends up as a weight-guesser at a carnival, where a tough motorcycle jumper named Patty (Catlin Adams), with a propensity for throwing her helmet at the nearest schlub, teaches him about what his mother told him was his ""special purpose."" Navin, however, falls in love with a young woman named Marie (Bernadette Peters), and together, the two of them become unlikely millionaires due to an invention called the Opti-Grab, which helps to keep one's glasses on his or her face, that Navin helped to create. Navin is about to learn that having money may be as much a curse as it is a blessing.

There are a good number of laugh-out-loud moments in The Jerk, most of which play on Navin's dim-witted nature. For instance, when the madman is firing at him haphazardly, Navin assumes he's not fond of cans since he's such a bad shot. Another one that made me chuckle pretty hard was when Marie pulls the trumpet out of nowhere to accompany Navin's ukelele. Then, of course, there is the name of Navin's dog, which is not fit to mention on a family-friendly web page, but gets a laugh every time Navin calls him.

Steve Martin's comedy, to me, is hit-or-miss. I am generally not fond of when he is allowed to go too far over the top, as he is for much of this movie. He is much more effective when there are reins to pull him in, such as his understated work in Father of the Bride, but here he is given room to be all over the place, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Did I get plenty of laughs from The Jerk? Sure. Am I going to make a concerted effort to see it again any time soon? No, probably not.",1115510400,,2355,4.333333333333333
53368,4,0783226799,"One of Steve Martin's funniest films, The Jerk was far ahead of its time, part of a genre of off-the-wall, ridiculous comedies that would later dominate the box office throughout the 1990s. Films such as The Waterboy, Dumber And Dumber, and Zoolander have since taken the idea of an outlandish, exaggerated character and turned him into the star of a comic screenplay. In The Jerk, as in the aforementioned films, unfortunate events happen to the outcast reject, and the audience laughs. It's merely an extension of the old Charlie Chaplin or Three Stooges genre of film. But The Jerk is definitely a funny movie...

A bona fide idiot, Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) is nevertheless a kind and well-grounded man. Born in Mississippi, Navin is adopted into a black family, but remains clueless in regard to his origins. When Navin turns eighteen, he decides to strike out on his own (which takes the entire day since he decides to hitchhike and hours pass before the first car drives by). Navin initially gets a job at a service station where owner Harry Hartounian (Jackie Mason) takes advantage of Navin's work ethic and a deranged killer makes an attempt on Navin's life...

Eventually, Navin moves on to work for a carnival where he meets his future wife Marie (Bernadette Peters). Navin and Marie are in for the ride of a lifetime when a salesman passing through Navin's old service station turns one of Navin's inventions into a blockbuster product. The royalties make Navin a multimillionaire, but money cannot buy everything, and Navin and Marie must work together to be happy...

Some of the scenes from The Jerk, such as when Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters are in lying in bed, and Martin says ""It feels like I've know you forever..."" (and then continues with his endless monologue) can stand alone in making The Jerk worth any viewer's time. It's also hilarious when Navin gets ""published"" in the phone book only to have a killer randomly select him for death. By no means the greatest film ever made, The Jerk has its high points, and I recommend watching it once just to see if it's your cup of tea.

With a number of memorable scenes, The Jerk is a well-written (from a comic standpoint) screenplay which keeps the laughs constantly rolling down the line. Steve Martin is brilliant in his portrayal of the innocent and nave Navin Johnson. The character's endless optimism and quest to please makes him an instantly likeable character film viewers want to root for. A modern-day cult comedy classic, The Jerk is well-deserving of its designation as a must-see film. If you haven't seen, then you don't know what you're missing...

Steve Martin is Navin Johnson, an innocent dullard son of poor Black sharecroppers in the South who just can't seem to have any beat or rythm in his blood.  Navin has high hopes though, and so goes out to see the big world by hitching a ride to take him several blocks away.  After realizing how big the world really is, Navin finally comes to the big city to make a life for himself.  He's soon thrilled to see that he's someone important when his name appears in the phone book.  Navin eventually explores love with a woman played by Bernadette Peters. He also learns the values of entrepreneurship after he innocently invents a contraption for glasses called the Optigrab.  Fortune finally arrives but poor Navin is just too slow to deal with the greed, dishonesty, and other life misfortunes that pervade the world.  After many trials and tribulations, he realizes that his family and friends are all that matters.

53391,5,0783226799,"The Jerk is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen. The movie is about Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) who is a white boy adopted into a poor black family. He's a little ""slow"" and doesn't even realize he's white. The movie opens at his birthday where he's having his favorite ""tuna on a white bread sandwich and a twinkie for dessert"" dinner.
His problem is that he doesn't have rythmn, and late that night, he's listening to the radio when he hears ""white"" music, and finds that yes! he has rythmn!
So, Navin sets off to see the world, and a hilarous journey ensues - everything from a dog named sh*thead,  assasination attempts to love to riches to insanity happens to poor Navin, but it's a great journey!

Not that this is an especially *visual* film, but with so many lesser films on the market getting better treatment upon initial DVD release, I would have figured that even the '03 SERIOUS Steve Martin would have the impetus to make sure that this (one of his biggest films) was handled properly.
Nevertheless, it's a great film, with a lot of laughs, particularly comedy great Jackie Mason and Martin himself, who's in top form.

""The Jerk"" was Steve Martin's theatrical debut; he also co-wrote the story.  Directed by comedy legend Carl Reiner, ""The Jerk"" doesn't really have a proper plot.  It's more a series of gags strung together.
Martin is Navin Johnson, who was ""born a poor black child.""  Actually, Navin is the adopted son of an African-American family.  The family is dirt poor but happy.  On Navin's 18th birthday he sets off on the road to find fame and fortune.  The fame and fortune come after Navin invents the ""opti-grab,"" a handle for eyeglasses.  Unfortunately for Navin, his invention causes the user to go cross-eyed.
The wonderful Bernadette Peters co-stars as Navin's trumpet playing girlfriend Marie.
For a 2000 release, there really is no excuse for this bare-bones DVD.  It is presented in full-screen format, and the print has aged -- badly.  Every single scratch is shown in the clarity only DVD can provide.  Add to that Dolby Digital 2.0 mono sound and, worst of all, no special features.  Nothing.

---
First off, I love this movie.  It's silly, it's funny, it's touching in some places, but mostly, it's just entertaining.

My biggest complaint with this DVD is that it's one that offers little to no bonus value, and, to me, commits the cardinal sin of not putting the movie in it's original format - instead offering only a Pan and Scan Full Screen presentation.

I've hoped for several years that this movie would get a 'special anniversary' or other 'collectors edition' that would offer the original wide screen format and some decent special features, but finally had to break down and purchase this 'original' release of the DVD because my wishes seem to be going unanswered.

Please note that I rate the movie itself here a full 5 stars (* * * * *), but the DVD gets only 2 stars, for it's lack of respect to the buying public.

The movie was a classic when it was released.

Steve Martin, the ultimate 'white guy' finds himself 'born a poor black child', without rhythm and unable to figure out why he doesn't fit in with his Black brothers and sisters.

He gets motivated to go off and discover himself, and his adventures along the way are a total riot.

In many ways a model that could have been used for the original ""Rain Man"" character,  Navin R. Johnson (Martin's character) had a simple charm and naive streak that was almost unbelievable, but too funny not to laugh at.

This movie is a comedy classic, and it deserves a Special Edition and better treatment on DVD.  Hopefully someday it will get just that.",1041552000,122,1952,4.505681818181818

There are many times in this film where you will be laughing so hard that the tears will start to stream down your face and you will have to hit the pause button to catch your breath.
The storyline is quite simple - Navan R.Johnston (Martin) is raised by a negro family out in the countryside until one day when poor Navan discovers he is not coloured ! He decides that he does not belong any more and goes to the big city to make his fortune.
The best comedy bits in the movie are when Navan is tricked by a number of dodgy characters who play on his naivety.
This film was directed by Carl Reiner who makes a hilarious cameo appearance in the film. I can't explain any more because to do so would give away too much of the film.

This movie has been a family favorite since it debuted on TV in the early eighties, when we were too young to see the uncensored version.  So we got to deal with Navin's dog being named 'Stupid' instead of ..., close examination of the poor dubbing clued us in though.  The TV version also includes parts that the uncensored is missing, ala Navin's bid to be president of Texaco oil and his generous contribution to Donny's airplane seats fund.  It's an old story, one you've probably heard before, witness Navin's inability to find the rhythm as a white man being raised by poor black sharecroppers as their own. Singing the blues with the family doesn't help, because the songs depress him. Not even the sandwich wrapped in cellophane can stem the feeling that he's somehow 'different'. Mother sits him down and in a tender moment tells him he would be loved if he were the color of a baboons 'head'. Upon finding the beat, Navin strikes out on his own to see the world, proceeding past the end of the fence.  My favorite chapter of the film comes next when Navin takes his first job at Jackie Mason's gas station.  This situation leads to some of the juiciest dialogue as Navin haggles for a $1.10 an hour wage, wrangles a rental living space, loses a church to a car-load of credit card toting Latinos including Mr. Neusbaum, and is targeted for termination by a psychotic hit man. Beyond that, Navin finds love and lust, fame and fortune in turn while never forgetting his parents and past `that's a good boy'. Navin's child-like navet&eacute; coupled with his stupidity makes him an extremely endearing character, ultimately capable of winning the hand of Marie [Bernadette Peters], his true love... it also helps that he has a special purpose, 11 million dollars, and daisy stems on his roses.  Watch this film and be brought under Navin's spell, and remember you don't need one other thing... except...",960336000,3,2150,4.760752688172043
53440,5,0783226799,"Hands down, my favorite comedy film.
Steve Martin, who was raised by a poor black family, is shocked to learn that he's white.
So many highlights- ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" being played on the beach,  his explanation of how nine days seems like seventeen, his ""special  purpose""...
I saw this movie when it first came out and only  recently purchased the tape.
It's even funnier now.
Wickedly funny,  belly-laugh funny, tops ""There's Something About  Mary"".
Irrevent, over-the-top humor at it's best, with Carl Reiner  directing!",957744000,9,530,5.104651162790698
53441,5,0783226799,"I can't understand how someone could berate this film.  Steve Martin has done some funny things over his over-extended career but ""The Jerk"" was his best work by far.  From the oil can scene to the cat  juggling scene to the climatic ""...and I don't need anything  else!"" scene this movie makes me fall to the floor laughing every time  I see it.",954115200,,346,4.428571428571429
53442,1,0783226799,"The film itself remains, 21 years later, one of Martin's best efforts (""the new phone book is here! ""), and one of the overall funniest flicks ever, as other reviewers have noted. Why does this DVD  stink, then? It's full-screen only...NO WIDESCREEN! This is blatant  cheapness, laziness, and disregard on behalf of the DVD company, since many  of their other '70s comedy classics (""Slap Shot,"" ""Animal  House"") have been packaged properly with both full-screen and  widescreen options. There's just no excuse. It would've been nicer to see  Navin and his ""Special Purpose"" without the sides of the film cut  off.",952905600,15,613,5.07
53443,4,0783226799,One of Steve Martins first and funniest. This is a crazy film and you had to feel sorry for the dumb headed guy. He somehow goes from rockbottom to being rich and famous. A funny film which I recommend.,948931200,2,202,4.205128205128205

7790243,1,0783226799,"The movie itself obviously gets 5 stars, but the Blu-Ray edition gets ZERO Stars - it's a cheap money grab, where the DVD version was basically upscaled to 1080p and thrown on a Blu-Ray - I already owned this on DVD, so I didn't need another fuzzy copy.

There are plenty of older movies that have been re-issued where the studios went back to re-digitize the original film at a higher resolution - two examples would be Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Blazing saddles, both are old movies that look sharper on blu ray than they do on DVD.  This one unfortunately is Blur-Vision - it's not sharp, and looks no different than the DVD version. (just look at the tire on the roof in the first scene)
Additionally, just like the DVD version, it has some issues with it's conversion from the 4:3 original to 16:9 widescreen, the gas station scene contains a key gag that happens on the lower 1/4 of the 4:3 screen, The gas station owner makes a hand gesture to Navin, which Navin repeats back (While completely missing the point of the gesture) in the original, you can see both actors perform the gesture, but in the DVD and Blu Ray release, the gesture performed by Jackie Mason is completely clipped off screen.",1521417600,,1205,4.548387096774194
