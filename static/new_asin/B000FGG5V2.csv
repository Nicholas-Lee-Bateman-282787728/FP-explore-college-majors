8122342,5,B000FGG5V2,"This charming story of a young Native girl is a refreshing twist to a old and worn story. Some may not like it cause the characters are all Native Americans. But, this is the exact reason why I loved it. This was a endearing story for all kids to enjoy and my children were glued to the set watching it. Congrats for a updated version for the kids of a new century.",1324252800,2,365,4.083333333333333

THIS IS ABOUT AN INDIAN NAMED WHITE SNOW!!EVEN MY 3 YR. OLD GRAND-DAUGHTER CAME TO HER MOMMY & SAID SOMETHING WAS FUNNY (DIFFERENT) ABOUT SNOW WHITE.
MY DAUGHTER SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN THEN PACKAGE WAS YELLOWING LIKE IT HAD BEEN ON THE SHELF FOR A LONG TIME.
THEY WE'RE BOTH VERY DISAPPOINTED & WE WANT TO RETURN IT.",1264204800,,371,4.391304347826087
8122344,1,B000FGG5V2,"This is a knock off of the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  It's only a few minutes long (I believe it was 25 minutes).
I do not recommend this movie to anyone",1230336000,,169,3.9705882352941178
8122345,1,B000FGG5V2,"This version of Snow White is not worth viewing. The story's characters are ugly to look at, and the story is amateurily put together. Our grandsons soon lost interest watching this DVD.",1227312000,,186,4.84375
8122346,5,B000FGG5V2,"Let me help you figure out what this listed item on this page really is since it is hard to tell from the listing. This is a Rankin Bass animated cartoon, but not one of their ""Animagic"" stop motion features. It was one of the 30 minute episodes of the Festival of Family Classics that Rankin Bass Productions made for television broadcast on ABC in 1972-73. Rankin Bass made the many great holiday classics we all remember such as Frosty and Rudolph. If you are a fan of their films you will enjoy this great series very much.

This particular tape is actually two episodes from the series, at 30 minutes each. It starts with the story of ""Snow White"". The story has an animation style of many of the holiday Rankin Bass shows like ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"". The design for the dwarves is really fun. With limited time for the story in only a half hour, the producers had to make some creative changes to the story but it is enjoyable.

The next episode is ""Sleeping Beauty"", also well done. Good value on this tape having 2 episodes.

Some of the 18 episodes in the series were very much part of Americana with tales from fact and fiction such as Tom Sawyer, the Ballad of Paul Bunyan, Yankee Doodle, Johnny Appleseed, and Hiawatha. The other episodes in the series include classic literature and famous fables: Swiss Family Robinson, Cinderella, Puss `n Boots, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Robinson Crusoe, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Tree, The Arabian Nights, Robin Hood, and two double length episodes - Around the World in 80 Days, and 20,000 Leagues Below the Sea.

VERSIONS OF THE SERIES TO LOOK FOR - The label Prism Entertainment or Video Craft International released these episodes as possibly the first vhs release in a clamshell package as a set of two episodes per vhs tape. For example Jack O'Lantern and Yankee Doodle were on one tape. I am unsure of the year of that release since it is not listed on package or tape. These are very good quality video, sound and packaging, and the art on the box is authentic from the film. (There is a bad habit among video companies to use some hack art for animation covers that is not from the film, and makes the film look worse on the cover than what is actually on the tape, seems self defeating to me.) In 1988 Prism and Videocraft (now one word rather than Video Craft) released vhs copies in a slipcover package with one episode per tape, but the artwork on the cover does not look anything like the film. Both of the before mentioned Prism/Videocraft releases also say ""Childrens Video Playground"" on the front cover. In 1989 ""Starmaker Entertainment"" released some of the episodes, but their copies are not as good a quality as the Prism copies in my viewing of one episode, Johnny Appleseed. Also their cover art is not from the film and can throw you off. The next vhs re-releases of the series are from Anchor Bay Entertainment in conjunction with Starmaker Entertainment in 1989 through 1995 in a clamshell case with original art, but they are recorded in EP speed so the picture quality is not near as good. Then in 1994 Starmaker released a cardboard slipcover version with original art that actually says Rankin/Bass on the cover. Unfortunatley this version is also recorded in EP and does not have the best picture. In summary the early release version from the label Prism Entertainment or Video Craft International are the best quality I have seen of the series.

Also ""Puss-n-Boots"" has been recently re-mastered and is featured on DVD as an extra feature on the holiday Animagic release ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" by Golden Books Entertainment who now owns the whole series and is treating their DVD releases very well with extras and remastering. Maybe they will release more of the episodes comletely remastered,  hopefully all 18 of them.",1124323200,,3832,4.703427719821162
