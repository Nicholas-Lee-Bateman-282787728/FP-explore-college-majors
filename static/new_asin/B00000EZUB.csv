7905979,4,B00000EZUB,"This is a collection of 19 separate films about American railroads.  These date from 1897 to the late 1970s, but most are from the mid-1930s to the mid 1950s.  The original producers are not always identified; but it appears that most of these films were created as public relations pieces, either by the Association of American Railroads, or by individual railroads.  Two were evidently compiled specifically for this 2-disc publication.  The others were reproduced from archival footage.  The producers explain that they employed modern technology in an effort to achieve the highest quality reproductions; but ""some imperfections in image and sound quality are unavoidable.""  These imperfections are worse in some cases than others, but, in general, the images are comparable to what one might have seen on pre-HD television sets; and the sound is occasionally poor.  Each film is preceded by an introduction provided by one of several railroad historians (Walter Gray, Dale Reed, and Don DeNevi).  Most of these introductions are helpful.  In between films, viewers are regaled with Bluegrass music.  Brief descriptions of individual films follow (the times of duration are approximate).

1.  Introduction (7 minutes).  Footage, narrated by Walter Gray, describes the history of American railroads, including early engines, the transcontinental railroad, technological improvements, the impact of the Depression and World War II, and thereafter.

2.  ""Last of the Giants""  (ca. 1960, 25 minutes, color).  This film, produced by the Union Pacific Railroad, explains the quest for more power and the development of articulated steam engines.  Its focus is on the Union Pacific's 4-8-8-4 1,250,000-pound ""Big Boy"" locomotive.

3.  ""225,000 Mile Proving Ground""  (1953, 20 minutes, color).  Produced by the Association of American Railroads, this film shows how America's entire rail network served as a proving ground for new technologies, including track, engines, freight cars, and automatic traffic control.

4.  ""Flight of the Century""  (ca. 1935, 11 minutes, black and white).  This film, produced by the New York Central Railroad, follows the Twentieth Century Limited, including preparation and provisioning of the train, departure from La Salle Street Station in Chicago, the journey east, dining and sleeping arrangements, and arrival at Grand Central Station in New York City.

5.  ""Science Rides the High Iron""  (ca. early 1950s, 24 minutes, color).  Produced by the Association of American Railroads and narrated by Chet Huntley, this film shows how railroads have applied science to rolling stock, track maintenance, and traffic control.  Among the subjects treated are precise measurement of wheels, axles, and bearings, and the early use of computers in assembling trains.

6.  ""Operation Fast Freight""  (ca. mid-1950s, 24 minutes, color).  This Norfolk and Western production follows a time freight, showing how small shippers could expect personal attention from the local station agent, how a separate paper data card recorded the handling of each freight car, and how locomotives and track were maintained.  Freight trains carried diverse cargoes that could include grain, cattle, manufactured goods, and large steel girders.

7.  ""Steam Train Wrecks of the 1920s""  (9 minutes, black and white)  features original 1920s footage of train wrecks, accompanied by explanations of the causes and consequences of these wrecks.

8.  ""The Steam Locomotive""  (ca. 1935, 11 minutes, black & white).  Contrary to Walter Gray's introduction, this film is not about the New York Central's Hudson locomotive.  Instead, it presents a diagram of a steam locomotive that shows how it operates.  There is also footage of roundhouses and turntables, and locomotives being serviced.  Most of the equipment shown belonged to the Santa Fe Railroad.

9.  ""The Power Behind the Nation""  (ca. mid-1940s, 29 minutes, color).  A Norfolk and Western production, it is an advertisement almost as much for the coal industry as for the N & W.  It even includes a trip into a coal mine and descriptions of various products derived from coal.  Transporting coal was one of the principal facets of the N & W's operations.

10.  ""Clear Signal""  (ca. 1950, 18 minutes, color) was produced by the Safety Department of the Southern Pacific Railroad mainly to explain its safety procedures to its own employees.  These procedures included medical exams, safety classes and examinations, inspections of equipment, communication between crew members by radio, synchronizing watches, following train orders, and managing train movements by computers.

11.  ""Lifeline of a Nation""  (ca. 1944, 17 minutes, color)  describes how railroads contributed to the war effort by moving troops, raw materials, food, coal, munitions, and other supplies.

12.  ""The Freight Train""  (11 minutes, color) follows the Santa Fe's Fast Freight Number 40 from the time it is assembled at the Kansas City classification yard until it arrives in Chicago.

13.  ""Snow on the Run""  (ca. 1953, 17 minutes, color).  This Southern Pacific Railroad production gives an account of the record-setting 790 inches of snow that fell in California's Sierra Nevada mountains in the winter of 1951-52, which left passengers in the ""City of San Francisco"" stranded in a snowdrift for four days.  Although winters were not usually this harsh, the railroad had to deal with heavy snowfalls every year.  To do this, it relied upon special equipment such as spreaders, rotary plows, and flangers, whose operation is described in this film.

14.  ""Early Steam Trains""  (7 minutes, black & white) portrays some of the earliest films of American trains.  This footage, by the Edison and Biograph companies, dates from 1897 to 1906, and was shot mainly in the mid-Atlantic states.  Film for this DVD was generated from copies filed with the copyright office in the Library of Congress.  Most scenes are identified by the railroad and/or the location.

15.  ""The Milwaukee Road""  (25 minutes, black & white), produced by the Milwaukee Road Railroad, provides a good overview of 1950s railroad operations, including maintenance of track and rolling stock, arranging freight shipments and passenger travel, controlling train movements, and managing financial records (on data cards)

16.  ""California Zephyr""  (8 minutes, black & white) follows this streamliner on its way from Chicago to Oakland.  The ""California Zephyr,"" operated by three separate railroads, traveled across the plains, and through the Rocky Mountains.  This film shows dining cars, sleeping cars, and vista dome cars which afforded great views of western scenery.

17.  ""B & O's 8,000 Mile Birthday Party""  (ca. late 1970s, 18 minutes, color).  This film, which has no commentary, follows the ""Chessie Steam Special,"" a special tour train, pulled by a 4-8-4 steam engine--in Chessie System livery, although the purpose of its national tour was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  (The Chessie System had absorbed the B & O several years earlier.)

18. ""Big Trains Rolling""  (1946, 24 minutes, color).  This Association of American Railroads film gives a brief overview of the history of American railroads, and then follows two children as they take a long passenger train trip (on the Southern Pacific), having occasion to use the train's dining and sleeping cars before reaching their destination.  The film also describes the work that goes on in a train station, and the operations of freight trains.",1361836800,4,7541,5.388507718696398
7905980,2,B00000EZUB,This dvd has  very blurry pictures at times and it looks like it tiles  at the beginning . kind of looks like a puzzle pieces. . Would be a lot interesting if picture was a lot clearer.  Sorry  .,1357257600,,195,3.923076923076923
7905981,3,B00000EZUB,"I really wanted this DVD so I spent the money, BUT I wanted to see the different kinds of steam locos and watch them moving.  They are not rolling even half as much as I would have liked - that is why this review is three stars. I did learn from the different segments. Several of them are instructional movies for the grade schools from many decades back. Why is a girl interested in trains? Because my grandfather was a fifty-year man (They did mention Hagerstown.), and he experienced the depression a bit before others so I hear, which means my father and his brothers didn't get anything for Christmas for many years.  When my father had kids he didn't care that they were girls, we got cars and trains - LOVE it! So if you want a little bit of everything about steam trains, this is your ticket.",1205193600,7,801,4.369127516778524
7905982,3,B00000EZUB,"This set of tapes was a very good idea by someone.  The photography and films are very nice, and show trains in action and many aspects of trains and railroading not usually seen.  However, the producers really should have remastered the sound, as some of the soundtracks are almost unintelligible. A very nice try, but short.",1132358400,3,326,4.803571428571429
