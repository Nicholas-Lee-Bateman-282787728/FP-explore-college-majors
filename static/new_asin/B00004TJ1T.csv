1350318,5,B00004TJ1T,"I think the basic argument is intriguing.

1. Our bodies need 90 essential minerals, vitamins, and amino acids to function on a fundamental level.
2. We can no longer receive all the nutrients our bodies need from the four basic food groups for a variety of reasons (depleted farmland, GMO corporate farming, food processing, etc.).
3. Therefore, we must supplement our diets in order to maintain our health and prevent disease.

That's basically his argument, if you agree. I appreciate the information and it is jam packed with details. I use the products now and definitely feel more energy than I have in years. I feel great health. Is that placebo? Try it for yourself and decide. It is only [...] for 30 days and I know how to get it wholesale, so that's been nice. It doesn't have the scam feel to it. I like that the supplement is liquid so it is easy to ingest in a glass of juice and kids can take it in a sippy cup.

1350321,5,B00004TJ1T,"Dr. Joel Wallach, whom I've met personally, correctly assesses the majority of American causes of death as various mineral deficiencies--health issues that Veterinarians have CURED in animals for decades!  Using Wallach's guidelines, I have CURED my elderly mother's adult onset diabetes--CURED her excruciating arthritis, CURED my 11-year-old son's ""hyperactivity"", and CURED my own Hashimodo's Thyroiditis.  I had struggled with fatigue, overweight, anemia and a variety of illnesses my entire life and, at age 47 look and feel 33 again.  Scoff Wallach if you choose--but, as for me and my family-- well, we'll bring you applesauce at your nursing home!",1067904000,41,655,5.595959595959596
1350322,2,B00004TJ1T,"If you've just heard Joel Wallach's message through the ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"" audio cassette some MLMer probably gave to you, don't bother with this video, for a few reasons.
First one, being no one in their right mind would take nutritional advice from an overweight, bald man who is very sloppy in his apperance.  You get a much better visual from listening on your home stereo.
Secondly, I don't think Wallach will ever change his lecture.  I've heard Wallach speak on several different occasions, and he uses the same jokes and same stories each time for the most part.  Not to say his message isn't a good one.  It is, but change it up a little for Pete's sake.  How boring must that be for him to say the same speech 200+ times a year?
If you're new to the world of alternative medicine, this video can be valuable, but I just can't see how anyone would feel confidence about Wallach's message when you're looking directly at a visual of him.  Better to stick with the cassettes and CDs.",1048896000,22,996,4.5055555555555555

1350336,1,B00004TJ1T,"Not the same as his original audio recording called ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie."" He spends the first 30 minutes talking about prenatal health. Seems a bit extreme since a couple minutes on this topic would have been more than sufficient, but he goes on with analogy after analogy to try to drive the point home that mothers need to have good nutrition. It could have been summarized in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes. I love Wallach and listen to all his stuff but this particular version was not entertaining at all like his audio recording called ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"" from several years ago.",1451347200,2,590,4.6826923076923075

This is a Very Interesting and  informative DVD, causing the viewer to re-assess the persons one should visit for most health ailments today.
This Doctor seems to have learn't originally from a veterinary point of view, and as we 'human beings' are bodily from the Earth, the Doctors experiences seem very logical, to any 'thinking person.'  Well worth a purchase to open your eyes to another way to heal illnesses.

1350359,5,B00004TJ1T,"I just finished viewing Dead Doctors Don't Lie DVD - Someone Should Go to Jail by Dr. Joel Wallach, but I purchased it from another vendor, so I'm not an Amazon verified purchaser.  The DVD is not a video presentation with a live picture of Dr. Wallach, but Dr. Wallach narrates the entire presentation while showing pictures from medical journals, magazines, newspapers, and other sources.  He attempts to educate the public by presenting scientific data and research regarding our health and our health care industry.

According to Dr. Wallach, Alzheimer's is a physician caused disease.  He says by lowering your cholesterol, you increase your chance of getting Alzheimer's.  He says cholesterol is not the cause of heart attacks or any other disease.  He explains why he says this is true by showing data from research from reliable sources.  You can see the source of his information and do further investigation on your own if you question the truthfulness of what he's saying.

He says that all birth defects can be prevented by proper nutrition prior to conception and throughout the pregnancy.  He talks about the cause and treatment of congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and many other health problems.  He also offers solutions to these problems.  In essence, he shows what happens when we follow the doctors orders simply because they're doctors and we trust them to know what's best for us.  Dr. Wallach explains why the medical doctors we trust are dead wrong and should go to jail for much of what they're doing.

I highly recommend this DVD to all who want to make educated decisions about their health or the health of their loved ones.",1416614400,41,1661,4.910394265232975
