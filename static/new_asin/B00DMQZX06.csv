8594562,1,B00DMQZX06,"David Avocado Wolfe believes the sun is made of chocolate, gravity is a toxin, and that the earth is flat. He has no training in nutrition. It is dangerous to accept any advice from this man regarding health and diet as he tries to not only sell bogus cures for disease for his own profit, but he recommends DANGEROUS ""cures"" like apricot seeds. You will be more beautiful if you keep your money and donate it to a worthy charity - let that beauty shine from the inside as you eschew pseudoscience for profit.",1518048000,,509,4.425531914893617

8594565,5,B00DMQZX06,"Anything David Wolfe but even he has outdone himself with this video and his book Eating for Beauty. He is the real deal, walks the talk, lives it, breathes it. Inspiring, upbeat & a well-spring of knowledge & wisdom. In this age of information, I have learned the most VITAL knowledge from a handful and David Wolfe is at the top of the list.",1437264000,,343,4.375
8594566,5,B00DMQZX06,"This dvd presentation is absolutely fantastic for anyone trying to improve their health and overall outlook. If you are just starting your healthy lifestyle change, or even if you have always lived healthy; Give this dvd set a try.
David Wolfe presents these recipes in such a fashion,  That just watching while he prepares each dish is a fun and entertaining experience.
This is my opinion,  and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
Just a side note; you might want to purchase a Nutri Bullet,  or have a really good blender handy. I use both everyday and I have lost 44 pounds and counting since February 2014.",1406678400,3,614,4.513513513513513
8594567,2,B00DMQZX06,I suppose I was looking for more down to earth healthy tips.  I just didn't relate to him the way I had hoped. Was thinking about his conference in CA in 2014 with a friends invite. I got the dvd so I could see what he was like and it just didn't inspire me to want more. I will try a  juice he recommended with real foods. Much of the others seem to be with his supplements he sells. Would be very expensive and was definitely for someone who is more extreme in their health approach.,1379808000,5,485,4.041666666666667
