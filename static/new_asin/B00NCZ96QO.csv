8677448,4,B00NCZ96QO,"I'm a life-long journalist, specializing in the changing character of global media, but I never looked into opera in a serious way until the past few months. I've spent many years writing about American life, arts and film. But having not paid much attention to the world of opera, I had not realized how profoundly 19th-century developments in this realm of music, theater and drama really prefigured leaps and bounds we would see when cinema really got rolling in the 20th century.

I started my quest with Richard Wagner, because I have reported over the years about the Holocaust and its tragic impact on the world. I had encountered Wagner in references in reporting on current stories that hark back to Europe during the Nazi regime. To learn more about those cultural connections in documentary-DVD form, I also can recommend they thought provoking film about Wagner's legacy by Stephen Fry&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Me/dp/B00B8W7LD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner & Me</a>.

That brings me to this DVD set of films that try to go back and forth between Wagner and Verdi and give us some cultural contrasts between the two lives and their bodies of work. I do suggest that customers read the other reviews of this DVD set, which raise questions about the accuracy and scope of these films. One review even dismissively calls this a set of student-quality films.

I would say, in contrast: From what I am now learning about the life and work of Wagner, it's true -- there is a lot that is overlooked or simplified to the point of perhaps being misleading in this collection of films. But, overall, I think these are films well worth watching if, like me, you're trying to do some broad exploration of these figures. Sure, you'll want to include some good reading about these composers; obviously, you'll want to see some of their works; and if you're serious, you won't rely on this single DVD set to tell you everything you can learn about Wagner or Verdi for that matter.

There simply isn't a lot of good documentary filmmaking about Wagner these days -- I'm sure for obvious reasons, given the lightning rod nature of his legacy in the 1930s and 1940s. Another film I can recommend to explore one more intriguing aspect of Wagner's life is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-s-Jews/dp/B00LNJDEZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner's Jews</a>. That's another documentary brought to us by the team at First Run Features.

I wouldn't call this film a perfect first choice to learn about Richard Wagner. I would recommend it, though, if you're really trying to explore many facets of his life and work and you're skimming through the available DVD documentaries for something to watch. This set of films is helpful, on balance.",1459641600,,2838,5.269911504424779

Wagner vs. Verdi  runs a hundred and fifty minutes, and not one of them passes without some banality or nonsense. It is possible that this six-part documentary series, produced for German public television for the VerdiWagner bicentennial, had some perceptible merit when shown in its original language. Here, though, rendered into English, it is of extraordinarily dubious worth  repeatedly making you wonder whether the filmmakers had any but the most cursory knowledge of the topic.
Quite a bit must have seemed dodgy even in the original language  like the dancers, shrouded in white veils, who prance around an empty room, purportedly giving form to the composers heroines; or the twin brothers with electrodes taped to their skin, submitting to questionable research about the varying neurological effect of the two composers music; or the young bureaucrat, supposedly vetting the composers revolutionary tendencies for Chancellor Angela Merkel, given to statements such as I am confused: the composer who fought the aristocracy and looked ahead of Europe  an anti-Semite??
These lapses in taste and sense are joined, in the English-language version at least, by much false information. Here we learn that Turin is considered the hometown of bel canto; and that, by 1844, Verdi had composed not six operas (the real figure) but fifteen, including Rigoletto (1851)and Traviata (1853); and that Winifred Wagner (born fourteen years after Wagners death, and later the wife of his son, Siegfried) was the composers sister-in-law. But the series reaches its nadir when it considers anti-Semitism at Bayreuth, pointing the finger solely at Cosima and her circle, ignoring Wagners authorship of Judaism in Music.
Unitel is one of the producers of this farrago; the company presumably entered into the project in order give an airing to its decades-deep catalogue of opera on video. This gives us glimpses of a number of intriguing performances, but whether of the conservative or regie variety, they're almost entirely ill-matched to what is being said. One exception: when the singing teacher Elio Battaglia talks about the importance of diction in Verdi and the documentary cuts to footage of Anna Netrebkos cloudily articulated Violetta, the filmmakers seem to take a (no doubt inadvertent) potshot. The disc does offer some nice travelogue-glimpses of Bayreuth, SantAgata and the great opera houses of Europe. But their relevance to the matter at hand is often, at best, tangential  as with footage of a recent Carnival in Verdis hometown, supposedly illustrating the one time a year that the Bussetani forget their morality.
One can only assume that the likes of Christian Thielemann and Rolando Villaz&oacute;n sounded less vapid on the original soundtrack than they do here. Or that the physicist Hans-Ullrich Balzer made some sort of sense in German when he said whats rendered here as Usually composers compose their music according to their own self, or how they would like to be. Both mortals can be found. But one wonders what kind of mistranslation could excuse Eva Pasquier-Wagner for saying, of the Nazi influence at Bayreuth, Whether this can be seen in a negative or positive way, I cant say.
The whole mess comes to its all-too-welcome end with the imponderable statement, Wagners music, with all of its intensity and power, is essential for dealing with the apocalypse. This might reflect a sentiment so profound that its true meaning cant be rendered into English. More likely, though, its an indication that the filmmakers have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
