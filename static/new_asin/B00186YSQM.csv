8268643,5,B00186YSQM,"So what if Defenders of the Universe is a poor series. Not only does this set feature several decent cartoons such as cool mccool and beetle bailey but it also features two of the greatest animated series of all time: Krazy Kat & Snuffy Smith - two awesome series from the 60s. Several Krazy Kat episodes on this set are expertly directed by animation maestro Gene Deitch. The set features 27 episodes of this series. You also get all 50 episodes made of snuffy smith- a complete collection. Great balls of fire, that's a good deal! Toss in cartoons such as blondie and dagwood, the 1989 Betty Boop specials, and many more and you'll have a great set worth picking up for fans of classic animation.",1464307200,,698,4.5476190476190474

8268645,3,B00186YSQM,"I like this product but dic 4 that is 6 hour long it has various cartoons on it snuffy smith & barney google; blondie & dagwood, betty boop & hagar the horrible the entire tape has only snuffy smith; one betty boop and one hagar the horrible and 2 blondie & dagwood. on disc 5a & 5b they have other various cartoons but the same cartoons are also on disc # 2 and they have the nerve to charge $11.99 for this showing duplicate cartoons on the other disc. The dvd picture is very clear.
