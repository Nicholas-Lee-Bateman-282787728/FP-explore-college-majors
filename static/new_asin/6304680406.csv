906146,4,6304680406,"Far more intelligent and absorbing than your typical giant-rampaging-monster-on-the-loose flick, Kronos is one of my top picks for `most underappreciated science fiction film,' possessing one of the more ingenious SF concepts of the 1950s (see also Monolith Monsters), as well as one of the decade's coolest, ahead-of-its-time alien invaders. The cast includes familiar genre stalwarts Jeff Morrow (Creature Walks Among Us, The Giant Claw), John Emery (Rocketship X-M, The Mad Magician), and Morris Ankrum (zillions of B-westerns and SF flicks), with Barbara Lawrence (Oklahoma!) as the lady scientist/love interest. The moody B&W cinematography is by Karl Struss (Island of Lost Souls, The Great Dictator, Mesa of Lost Women), and the curiously Angry Red Planet-like score is by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter (too many genre credits to list). Competently directed by B-film veteran Kurt Neumann (The Fly, She Devil), the film unfolds like a mystery, building slowly at first, adding a few plot twists, then really kicking in with the appearance of the colossal metallic ""energy collector"", subsequent scenes of devastation, and final assault on Los Angeles. The always-imaginative if chronically underfunded Jack Rabin-Irving Block-Louis DeWitt effects team (World Without End, War of the Satellites, Atomic Submarine) gets a major assist from 20th Century Fox budget dollars this time out and it shows, particularly in the design and execution of the monolithic robot itself and the scenes of mass destruction, effectively realized through the clever orchestration of miniatures, animation, mattes, stock footage, and spacey sound effects. The script may not always hold up to intense scrutiny (why don't the aliens just send their device to suck energy directly from stars?), the science is more comic-book than Isaac Asimov, and it's almost impossible not to think ""George Jetson"" every time George O'Hanlon (GJ's voice on TV) opens his mouth; but if this was in Technicolor it would be revered today as one of the SF greats (just compare this to the extremely overrated ""classic"" This Island Earth some time).
The Image DVD presents the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and while the source print exhibits some light speckling throughout, the brightness, contrast, tonal values, sharpness, and detail are uniformly excellent. A middling-quality trailer and 16 chapter stops are the only extras, but this is still a must-have for any serious collector of 50s science fiction, especially at the recently-reduced price.  I'll probably be sorry I said it but, in the right hands (James Cameron? Darren Aronofsky?), a modern remake of this could kill!",1008633600,18,2660,5.42512077294686
906147,3,6304680406,"I remember seeing Kronos as a child when it aired on television. It seemed scary back then. It is not so scary today, and the effects are crude, but it is still a pretty good movie. The premise is that a giant robot from another world has come to earth to suck up our energy. The planet it came from was experiencing an energy crises, how prophetic is that? This giant Tin Man with attitude is attacking our power plants and other sources of energy. Astronomers investigate and track this thing, with one of them being possessed by an alien, and two others falling in love. If you like fifties horror, you will enjoy this one.",1004400000,4,626,4.405172413793103
906148,4,6304680406,"Kronos is one of those science fiction movies from the 50's with an interesting story. Kronos is a huge energy absorbing alien robot that has comes to earth to accumulate all of its energy. It sucks energy from power plants to an H-bomb; as a result it grows larger and larger. It's not a bad movie, I recorded it years ago and recently purchased it on DVD and now enjoy the better quality.",1001203200,7,390,4.3561643835616435

906150,5,6304680406,"""Fell from the sky like an astroid.  A huge metal monster draining the world of it's metal!"" to quote Benjamin quoting the trailer.  Benjamin (4 years old) stomps around the kitchen shooting rays and sucking all the energy out of the appliances.  He never gets tired of this one and it's one I don't mind too much myself.  The best part is the end where they finally blow the thing up, taking most of LA with it, and then with satified smiles, a job well done -- resolve to go off and take in a movie.",980812800,2,501,4.1875
906151,3,6304680406,"The creators of this movie deserve credit for having tried someone a little different in the alien menace line, a genuine mechancial monster which actually has a rational purpose in mind (i.e. the harvesting of energy for an alien world which has already exhausted its natural resources--and note the ahead of its time warning that we might someday be in the same predicament.)
Considering the limited budget they had available, they did a decent job.  I think the opening credits are downright elegant in their clean simplicity and Kronos itself is a beautiful Art Deco menace.
Of course, the science is ridiculous.  Power planets CREATE power, they don't contain power.  Getting energy by sucking it from a power plant is like getting shoes by sucking them from a cobbler!
Also, I still wonder, since the walking pistons on Kronos only go up and down, how did it get any forward motion?  Wouldn't it have just eventually drilled itself a nice hole in the ground and disappeared from view?
One bit of trivia.  In the role of the handsome scientist's funny sidekick is George O'Hanlon, later the voice of the cartoon's George Jetson, playing one of his few live action roles.  Every time you hear him talking about the danger Kronos poses to mankind in that distinctive voice, you expect him to suddenly shout out, ""Jane, stop this crazy thing!""",970444800,94,1345,4.851528384279476
906152,4,6304680406,"What a great monster!  I always loved watching ""Kronos"" as a  kid....who couldn't love this massive metal giant rectangle stampeding  across the country using it's piston shooting legs?!?!?  And now the new  DVD release finally gives us the film in it's original widescreen (scope!)  ratio....WOW!!!  I remember the full-frame version chopped off newspaper  headlines and other action terribly.  This new transfer looks great.  Ya, the movie suffers a little bit from talky moments, but it's still campy  fun and whenever Kronos is on screen...it's Fantastic!  Industrial  Mayhem!!!!  Kronos will suck you dry!",968371200,55,610,5.489130434782608
906153,4,6304680406,"This is one of the movies I grew up with in the 50's.  I looked forward to it to appear on those Saturday morning early scifi movies on the local channels.  Like ""The Thing"", I would love to see this movie  remade by one of the special effects wizards like James Cameron only  because the excellent doomsday story could be adapted very easily to modern  day.  The only thing that this movie lacks is the modern special effects to  make the metal monster believable.  The story is believable.  If you think  about the new Godzilla remake and compare a remake of this movie to that Mr  cameron, you would see there is a fortune to be made.  You would definately  get the 50's audience for this one.",945993600,,696,4.3858267716535435
906154,3,6304680406,"Well, folks, you get about everything with this one: the ""hunky"" one-eye-browed, lab-coated generic ""scientist"", his wise-acre co-worker, the shapely blond neglected in favor of work, a computer named  ""SUSIE"" with more blinking lights and spinning wheels than Vegas,  and the usual threat to the planet. All that's missing is the older, wiser  scientist (who's usually the blonde's father), but hey! You also get more  stock footage than you can shake a stick at: some interesting background on  how to set up and launch a V-2 (including a FULL 20-second count-down AND  at no extra charge a ""25 seconds to impact...24...23...22..."" etc  wind-up), some rare film of the original YF-100 (hot stuff back then!)  zooming around, and even a rocket-assisted B-47 scramble. Whew! Add to the  mix one honkin', stompin' robot monster that only gets bigger when whacked  with an H-bomb, and you have a pretty typical late night movie. Definitely  NOT in the ""Forbidden Planet"" category, but it beats the hell out  of sitting through ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", guys. As an added  bonus, our guy-and-gal team get to do a little roll in the surf ""From  Here To Eternity""-style. Fire up the popcorn popper, turn off the  lights, and it's a trip down nostalgia boulevard. Next stop.....how about  ""Angry Red Planet""??",923356800,3,1301,5.066037735849057

907703,2,6304680406,"I see this has some positive reviews. Which is incredible in itself. This is a bad film even from the 1950s standards. The special effects are ludicrous. The accumulator Kronos looks like something from a Post-Modernist design school, a giant rectangular battery. The film is short, barely 1 hour and 18 minutes. It has the old tired motifs of aliens possessing important scientist--a motif of the Cold War Era paranoia--a useless woman scientist more interested in sex than science, the aliens are not given any opportunity to justify themselves, the first invasion begins in the desert, etc., etc. The idea of an alien planet dying and needing more energy has been better in other films (such as This Island Earth and The Man Who Fell to Earth). Kronos does get better in the final scenes when Dr. Gaskell figures out that omega rays will destroy the accumulator. (This, after feeding it a hydrogen bomb only makes it bigger). The film was not really entertaining except the parts where the psychiatrist tries to diagnose Dr. Elliott (possessed by the aliens) and only through the possessed voice of Dr. Elliott does audience learn what the aliens are up to. And the psychiatrist must die! He knows the truth! Even though he does not believe it. It is too convenient that deadly electrical machinery just happens to be near the bed, so easy to kill the psychiatrist. The early scenes where the scientists at Lab Central are convinced the object is a asteroid/planetoid when the image displayed is too obviously a flying saucer are laughable. The scientists don't come off as all that bright.  I found the film unsatisfactory, especially as the viewer doesn't get to know the aliens. In sum, the film is one-sided and just cheap on all levels.",1395446400,,1744,4.852348993288591

According to the tale, A flying saucer, mistaken for an asteroid has fallen into the sea and rising from its depths came the robot, nicknamed Kronos. The planet from which it came was able to turn energy into matter, but depleted its own energy sources doing so. The robot was sent to harvest energy from every source possible including an H-bomb that failed to abort in time. It was interesting for several reasons, this was not a bipedal monster and did not look like a typical robot. And while there was alien possession of a couple of people to control it, the aliens themselves were never seen. The robot was a threat, but it made no threats, it just got down to the business at hand. The effects were fairly good for a B-picture and the ending was predicable.

The movie starts with a walnut shaped object (but much larger) approaching earth and crashing into the Pacific ocean producing a small glowing orb (this coincides with much reported sightings of UFO's around the world even now). The presumed alien within the orb takes over the mind and body of the first human it encounters and then proceeds to infiltrate a scientific research lab ostensibly to gain control of it in order to enable it's giant machine to sap the energy of the entire earth. Jeff Morrow, a scientist who works at the lab, is able to figure out that the machine is converting energy into matter and makes itself even bigger when an atomic bomb is dropped in an attempt to destroy it.

Random thought, I wonder how many young boys in the 50's watching these movies were influenced to become scientists? Cool job, get to be hero, and always get the sweater enhanced good looking babe inserted into the movies.

Anyway back to the film. Giant robot-monster type thingy which perceptually is many times bigger then the flying saucer emerges from saucer and goes on the rampage. From there it is typical scientists trying to figure out what to do while the military fails to stop it. Jeff Morrow is our lead, vet of 50s sci fi. He plays a super serious scientist who is much to busy to notice the come ons of his girlfriend who appears to be the labs' film developer. Who knew labs had such a position?

Story is average for these type of movies. Acting is poor. The ""monster"" is kind of different in a good way. Special effects aren't too bad for the times. Picture quality was pretty good. HOWEVER, the audio, at least on my copy, kept going in and out throughout the movie. This may have just been my copy as I don't see any other complaints about it.

908043,4,6304680406,"This is a very intelligent and well done movie especially for a low budget 1957 movie. No flying saucers or little green men here. Its the first film that I can remember where the aliens were non physical entities. However these aliens have not come to Earth for tea and cookies; they come as conquerors who are in desperate  need of energy and they mean to take it. To do this requires physical technology on a grand scale and they have it. A Robot the size of a skyscraper is sent to Earth to accumulate and store all the Energy on the North American continent. If successful more will be sent. The Robot is dubbed Kronos because of its gargantuan size. Kronos has massive Armour plates that are impenetrable and absorb energy like a sponge. Kronos does something else as well. Kronos is able to initialize and accelerate Atomic reactions and then store the released energy as mass: converting energy into matter. Kronos may be all powerful but is not independent and needs instructions from its alien master which has possessed a leading nuclear physicist who misinforms the military about the nature of Kronos and tricks them into doing the worst thing in the world...... dropping a Hydrogen bomb on it.
  The plot is good and makes some sense. They do at least attempt to stick to hard science. Some of the special effects work well and some don't. Kronos the Robot is impressive. Most of the acting is just fair, except Jeff Morrow who is very good. The only argument I have with the movie is the ending which is unconvincing and feels like it was tagged on at the last minute. Its like they couldn't think of any other way to end it because they had painted themselves into a corner.

Sawtell and Shefter pulled off rather neatly! My main complaint is with the uselessness of letterbox format (VHS version) for a film in which there is virtually no action, in fact nothing of very great interest going on across the wide screen. Of suspense, there is none. 'Kronos' does however boast: A goofy nerd scientist in a bowtie cracking wise with the most unsparkling repartee since Peewee Herman. The most unconvincing love scenes ever committed to celluloid since George Nader and Claudia Barrett made like lovebirds in 'Robot Monster' (between a stilted Jeff Morrow and a distinctly embarrassed-looking Barbara Lawrence). The story might have taken off with a competent script and more expert directorial hand. To have the nominal star, Kronos, merrily changing energy into matter is intriguing in itself, and he's a scary-looking antagonist as he rampages mechanically across the landscape, cubical and faceless and gigantic. But he moves at a pace not much above a snail's and so does this film. Two stars bestowed because the first ten minutes are actually pretty good!",1332115200,,1385,5.2152466367713
908429,5,6304680406,"After reading the reviews and comments here, and watching the film again recently, I've finally figured out the subtle plot of this sleeper.

The mission of Kronos, was to absorb energy from stars so as to make it readily available to an expanding, interstellar alien civilization.

However, as in the movie Alien, this robot ship from another world had standing orders to investigate any intelligent life that it might encounter along the way.  Since Kronos could also convert matter into energy--what would be the sense of storing energy as matter if the former was beyond the alien technology?--absorbing a star could easily be to near depletion; in fact robots of this kind could readily absorb an entire solar system.  Hence Kronos would not proceed with its mission to absorb the energy of a star if there were indigenous intelligent life on any of its nearby planets.

So, upon seeing some evidence of intelligent life on earth, Kronos sought contact with the inhabitants by first sending out a telepathic, pure energy ambassador.  Making contact with a man driving at night, Kronos said, through the ambassador, in effect, ""are you intelligent?,"" and the first thing to come to the driver's mind was a scientific research facility he happened to have just passed.  So he made a quick u-turn and made his way to the first scientist he could find.  Unfortunately, the driver happened to be a violent criminal, and the scientist, on the verge of a nervous breakdown: the driver made his way to the scientist by clubbing people with a wrench, and the first thing the scientist did upon encountering the ambassador, was to have a psychotic break, becoming completely paranoid and developing a split-personality. All of this was soon followed by the earth sending up some missals to destroy Kronos, unprovoked.

Kronos was not quite up to the task of processing this information and coming to any definite conclusion, and so it decided to make a visit to earth itself to investigate further.  Since Kronos thrived on absorbing energy, it couldn't even figure out if the missals were sent as an act of hostility, or as an act of friendship.  So confusing was this torrent of information, once Kronos, the scientist and the criminal were all simultaneously linked through the ambassador for so much as a moment, the criminal died of shock.

Kronos communicated its benevolent intentions to the scientist, but, being paranoid, the scientist--Dr. Hubbell Eliot--could believe neither that its intentions were benevolent, nor that it was interested in energy from the sun, rather than from the earth, and the paltry projects the scientist was a part of.  So, in a Norman Bates like rage (where Norman would dress up as his mother to kill women he was attracted to, imagining she was jealous rather than dead), Dr. Eliot proceeded to tell Kronos to attack power plants and go after stockpiles of nuclear weapons, absorbing whatever energy it could, imagining that he was possessed by Kronos and it was all Kronos' idea.  He would then ""switch"" back to his more ""lucid"" self, to tell his psychiatrist as to how Kronos was there to destroy the earth because of its envy of our power.  Yet Kronos never does anything destructive--except when we see it trying to communicate with Dr. Eliot--and Eliot in some fit of rage.  Kronos complied only in its efforts to establish contact--it visited power plants only because it was trying to show appreciation, so to speak--; it trampled things in its path--as did the night driver it first contacted--merely in a befuddled attempt to read through the mixed messages of the psychotic break and adopt local customs. ('Navarez Electro' is the first power plant which Dr. Eliot sends Kronos to.  'Navarez,' apparently, is here taken to have the meaning, 'the treeless country' or the 'plains;' on the flip side, when Dr. Eliot pronounces it, chanting it to Kronos, it sounds like ""navaris""--Latin for, 'to do with enthusiasm.')  In the end, Kronos is even easily destroyed by another scientist, as Kronos was so trusting, allowing that scientist to sprinkle some matter (omega baryon particles) into its inner workings (Kronos was nice enough to earlier show the scientist these workings by voluntarily opening itself up as it was being examined) to cause a short circuit whereupon Kronos consumes itself.

As for why Kronos grew so large after absorbing so comparatively little earthly matter (albeit temporarily converted to the form of energy), this was more evidence of how advanced the alien civilization was: consuming local visible energy was really just for the sake of enabling Kronos to absorb large quantities of dark matter from far and wide, through wormholes.  To Kronos, even the sun was nothing more than a pilot light.

Good special effects for a 1950's shoestring budget. Kronos is unforgettable.  One of Jeff Morrow's best performances, as the scientist who does Kronos in.  Priceless George Jetson cameo appearance, as Morrow's sidekick (and already on the verge of a sore finger from pushing buttons).

908431,4,6304680406,"KRONOS: RAVAGER OF PLANETS is one of that wonderful genre of 1 1/2 star movies that somehow manage to be far better than they should. Filmed in 1957 and starring the Mexican Air Force in a supporting role, KRONOS concerns the depredations of an eponymous giant cube-shaped metallic robot that travels throughout the galaxy seeking host planets (such as Earth) which it can drain dry of energy. It even absorbs a full atomic blast with barely a burp.

Conceptually speaking, this is one of the most original ""Radiation is Coming to Get Us"" monsters, well worth watching. The low-budget special effects don't do KRONOS real justice, and the storyline meanders a bit, which makes it only a Four Star One-and-a-Half Star film.

908524,3,6304680406,"Jeff ""This Island Earth"" Morrow stars as a scientist (of course) in a typical 1950's science fiction flick about an enormous robot that comes to Earth to take all our energy, leaving our planet lifeless and dead. This film has extremely hokey special effects starting the bogusness with an electrical field in space and a ludicrous UFO. That's to be expected given the vintage of the picture, but by anyone's standards the special effects reach comic proportions when the giant robot rises up out of the sea and invades Mexico, and when I say invades, I mean invades...by walking. When the robot walks the filmmakers choose to use an extremely humorous animation technique that is guaranteed to make the average moviegoer roll their eyes.

The film is not about the effects, though. It's more dialogue-intensive than most of its sci-fi counterparts, and despite some utterly incomprehensible science exchanges and a gigantic computer named SUSIE (which seems to do nothing useful), it's more a drama than a typical sci-fi action flick. Unfortunately for a drama, it's not especially well acted, and drags frequently. My favorite moments of the film are the ""walking"" Kronos (named for a monster in Greek mythology) and the futile efforts of the Mexican Air Force to repel Kronos with P-51's that were obsolete even in 1957. Second in ridiculousness only to the walking effect is Kronos emerging from the ocean off Mexico during a romance scene highly reminiscent of ""From Here to Eternity"". After much bogus science babble, the humans daringly attempt to reverse Kronos' polarity by clever employment of a H-bomb in Los Angeles. Seems plausible.

""Kronos"" is typical of cold war science fiction: heavy on the nuclear threats, tepid romances, oddball machines, and gross misapplication of physical laws to provide an hour and a half worth of paranoid thrills. While the special effects are laughable, the film is by no means anywhere near the bottom of the barrel for the genre. Unfortunately, it's not near the top either.

908756,4,6304680406,"The 50s saw a deluge of alien invasion movies and KRONOS was one of the best.  Hollywood then tended to view such invasions as simply another variation of storming the beaches at Tarawa.  Director Kurt Neuman worked with a shoestring budget to present a surprisingly engrossing thriller that succeeds despite what now seems like some pretty hokey FX but then such effects were considered state of the art.  What keeps the viewer involved is believable acting, decent scripting, and many scenes of cinematic power not all of which had to do with the 10 story tall walking robot.  Jeff Morrow is instantly recognizable as the hero, Dr. Gaskell, a role that he perfected as the stern-faced gruff voiced lead of several previous films.  His girlfriend Vera is played by Barbara Lawrence, a beauty not well known then.  The two have a give and take relationship that flows naturally from their mixture of a personal and professional life.  Morris Ankrum is another character actor well known to science fiction fans of the decade.  Here he is a doctor, just the sort of role that his gravitas made memorable.

Whenever a cheaply made science fiction film resonates with the public, the cheapness is a function of finance, not of talent or merit.  From the moment that the UFO appears, the cast and crew combine to present a believable tension that increases even when the viewer sees the slightly ridiculous stomping robot mashing all in its path.  When the actors believe in their roles, the audience will too.  Even at the finale which call for a deux ex machina ending to save the world when the H bomb fails,  only the hardly noticeable surface details get smudged.  Who, for instance, notices the lack of a hole when the bomb went off?  But I quibble.  What emerges from KRONOS is the realization that when a director may be bereft of funds, as long as he has the vision to use what is under his control, then the finished product need not be the clunker that the uninitiated think such a film as this one must be.",1246752000,,2014,4.6789772727272725

While Kronos does indeed have a monster threatening the world, the film keeps the monster design simple enough (it's a giant metal cube) to make it believable, even today.  Jeff Morrow and Barbara Lawrence make a better than usual couple fighting the monster.  I will admit that some of the sets are dated and producers could have used a few more cast extras to add some excitement and realism to the monster hunt.  However, the monster's intention, to drain the Earth of all energy, works very well in the movie as the Air Force decides to nuke the monster, calls the plane back once they realize they will only give the monster more energy then can only stand and watch as the monster pulls the bomber into itself anyway causing a nuclear explosion.  This lets the monster grow several times larger to the size of a mountain.  The monster then drains LA of all electricty.  Nothing can stop this!  We'll all die!

The design of the machine is intriguing, and the animation of it is pretty good for the period (especially during the B-52 scene late in the movie.) In fact, with some tweaking of the dialogue, characters, and some of the special effects, this could have been a really good film. It would have been helpful if some of the ""scientific"" jargon had been vetted by a real scientist (a chronic problem with these things.) The ""solution"" our heroes come up with in the eleventh hour sounds like pure pseudoscientific nonsense to me.  Another problem is the token female staff member (played by Barbara Lawrence), who seems uninterested in anything except having ""fun""  with our obsessing main hero (played by Jeff Morrow.) The 1950s  had a major problem with portraying women as credible professionals.
While the machine is pretty well conceived, some of the earlier special effects left a lot to be desired.

On the other hand, there is a wonderfully atmospheric sequence shortly after our heroes arrive in Mexico (where the alien spacecraft has landed in the ocean), involving the appearance of a glowing dome in the water, lightning, fog, and earth tremors, and adding up to a night when the protagonists (and the audience) have no idea what the hell is going on or what to expect.

As much a product of the Cold War as the Golden Age of science fiction, it doesn't possess the scare factor that those who first saw it as children upon its release in 1957 talk about, but the story itself still remains a compelling one.  Kronos is actually one of your more subtle and subdued ""alien monsters,"" and I think the stark simplicity of the thing serves the movie well all these years later.  It's basically just a big metal box on legs rather than some prehistoric creature reborn or exotic-looking extraterrestrial, and it has only one purpose - namely, to absorb energy in massive quantities.  You might say it was ahead of its time in terms of its warning against man's potential over-use of energy and the Earth's natural resources.  Character-wise, the film doesn't make any waves (which means yes, there is a romantic link between a male scientist and one of his female colleagues), but the acting is above average and convincing.  The special effects are fairly decent as well (especially given the fact that this low-budget film was filmed in just a couple of weeks), minimizing the cheese factor (well, as long as you don't count the robotic walking business).

Dr. Leslie Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) is rather excited about his discovery of a new asteroid, much more so than his partner Dr. Arnold Culver and his colleague and girlfriend Vera Hunter (Barbara Lawrence) - until, that is, Gaskell figures out that the asteroid is heading toward Earth on a collision course.  With only sixteen hours until impact, the military works to intercept and hopefully destroy the unwelcome intruder as it enters Earth's atmosphere.  Those efforts turn out to be fruitless, but fortunately the asteroid comes down in the Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of Mexico.  That's just the beginning of the story, though.  Convinced that something is amiss, Gaskell and his gang fly down to check out the impact area for themselves, and so it is that they are the first to see the giant robotic creature that emerges from the ocean and eventually starts moving in search of energy sources, destroying everything and everyone in its wake.

The Mexican Air Force (all four planes) can't stop it, the Americans refuse to believe that their plan to clobber the thing with a H-bomb will only make it stronger, there's no time to import an annoying little Japanese kid to ""befriend"" the monster, and Jeff Goldblum is unavailable for consultation (largely because he was only five years old in 1957).

Wildly inventive,  unique B movie that successfully exploits atomic age paranoia.  The robot,  Kronos,  is fantastic in its menacing simplicity and beautiful art deco design.  I can't to this day understand why it was never made into a toy.

Other that the robot iself,  the unintentional humor is reason enough to buy this flick.  Kronos has it all!  Dreadful acting, spice rack and wagon wheel ""computers"" that are not even lit (!), hatchet cinematography,  leather jackets that say ""lab center"" on the back like a bowling club,  cockpits that don't match the airplanes,  perfectly cheesy animation,  I could go on and on.

On the plus side, there were lots of rooms full of cool analogue gadgets, and a computer that filled a room and overloaded when it received too much input.  At least those computers didn't get viruses.

My main complaint is the short running time of 80 minutes, and the extensive use of file footage, though some of it was pretty cool file footage.  I didn't find the characters particularly likeable or interesting, although I did like the plot point of having the alien possess humans before it's arrival and during it's romp through human civilization seeking energy.  It wasn't just a mad robot crushing everything; it had a real purpose.

Unlike many who review this movie, it doesn't bring back fond memories of the drive in theater or of my childhood.

909146,3,6304680406,"An innovative, interesting 50's science fiction film, ""Kronos"" departs from many of the other films of the day; aliens arrive from a distant galaxy but they don't visit us themselves instead they sent a skycrape sized robot to do their dirty work. This unusual science fiction minor classic manages to overcome a low budget and mixed visual effects to create a startling and intelligent science fiction 50's thriller.

Dr. Leslie Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) discovers an asteroid that mysteriously changes course as it comes close to Earth's atmosphere. The asteroid is really an alien UFO that launches an alien intelligence. This intelligence takes over the mind of a scientist (John Emery)to sabotage the computer at a research facility. Although Gaskell suggests Earth use nuclear missles to destroy it before it reaches earth, the asteroid crashes into the ocean. The next day a giant robot emerges with a mysterious agenda and with plans to destroy the Earth.

Directed by Kurt Neumann(""The Fly"", ""Rocketship X-M"") ""Kronos"" was one of the last films that Neuman directed (he died in 1958 the year after this was released). Based on a story by visual effects supervisor Irving Block (who did optical effects for a number of low budget movies in collaboration with Jack Rabin and Louis DeWitt), ""Kronos"" has a number of innovative ideas going for it to separate it from the pack of low budget sci-fi movies of the time. Although dated and with glaring gaps in the script, the film has its moments.  The visual effects although dated look quite good for the time and the film makes great use of stock footage. The only glaring error is the fact that the shadow from the blades from the helicopter are moving waaaay too slow to make sure that the ship would stay aloft. To be sure the film has its ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" moments (such as John Emery's horrid performance).

Jef Morrow's performance as Gaskell almost makes up for his appearence in that turkey ""The Giant Claw"". Featuring George Jetson himself George O'Hanlon as Gaskell's side kick Dr. Arnold Culver, the performances are typical for the most part of 50's films and pretty convincing as well.

A nice transfer from Image Entertainment is a highlight for this film. The blacks are solid with nice, rich blacks and gray scale. There's also the original theatrical trailer included as an extra. It's a pity that there's no commentary track or retrospective featurette on director Neuman's career.",1111190400,26,2458,4.956310679611651
909147,3,6304680406,"As the above title suggests, screaming newspaper lines help move our story forward in typical B movie fashion.  This '50s flick is a second string re-hash of those that went before.  Combine ""War of the Worlds"" with any number of other vintage sci-fi flicks, and you get the idea.  Invisible aliens practice mind control, but the real monster is a giant robot.  Picture a refrigerator with antennae that stomps around on pile-driver legs.  The trouble with refrigerators is, they don't have much personality.  Jeff Morrow grimaces and runs around trying to figure out how to fight an invader that sponges up the energy from whatever force is unleashed against it.  Things get intense when nukes are used.  To Kronos, nuclear weapons are an elixir.  The robot stops chasing Mexican field workers out of the cabbage patch, and bears down on Los Angeles.  The budget constraints led to cartoon type animation FX in long shots.  Initially the invaders land off the Mexican coast.  As unintended humor, the Mexican Air Force shows up in vintage WWII aircraft and battles the giant robot with predictable results.  Filmed in glorious B&W, the DVD edition is presented in letterbox format.  Aside form the trailer, there are no bonus extras.  This movie is of interest mainly to collectors and die-hard fans of low budget sci-fi flicks of days gone by.  We of this peculiar fraternity can have fun with it.

1.  The cinematography is great - you have some shots worthy of Conrad Hall's work on Outer Limits.
2.  Irving Block and Jack Rabin - two of the creative minds behind Forbidden Planet - did a lot of the production and model work and they did a lot on limited money.
3.  The monster - a giant electrical energy-sucking battery that pulverizes everything with its motive power units - has to be seen to be enjoyed.

909152,5,6304680406,"The very beginning of the 1950s saw a few big-studio, middle-budget science fiction films, notably the ones made by producer George Pal for Paramount studios: ""When Worlds Collide"" (1951), ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953), and ""The Conquest of Space"" (1955). All three were Technicolor productions with minor celebrities in the starring roles. But most of 1950s sci-fi cinema - with the wonderful exception of Disney's ""Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"" (1954) and Universal's ""This Island Earth"" (1956) - were strictly low-budget affairs, for the ""B"" position on the marquee. Having to craft the film on a shoestring, however, could provoke the genius of those involved. The superb ""Thing from Another World"" (1951) furnishes one example, the audacious ""Kronos"" (1957) another. Both belong to the alien-invasion genre. ""The Thing"" gives us an organic invader, a carnivore-vegetable-man portrayed by James Arness, and ""Kronos"" a predatory mechanism on a colossal scale whose purpose is to drain the earth of its energy resources. In both cases what my old teacher Fred Burwick liked to called ""the vampire esthetic"" is in full play and the nemesis therefore operates on the dual assumption (i) that life is a zero-sum game and (ii) that humanity is ripe for the picking. What sets ""Kronos"" apart from other genre-films of its category is its big conception. In ""The Thing"" (this is a strength) all the action occurs in a limited setting - the arctic base - and within a limited time-span: the production observes the Aristotelian unities. ""Kronos"" (this, too, is a strength) corresponds not to the classical but to the romantic ideal: a lone pickup truck driver on a desert road sees a meteor fall into the nearby sands; a glowing light zaps him, converting him into a remotely programmed zombie whose goal is to penetrate ""Lab Central"" where he will transfer the possessing intelligence to the facility's director. The context widens at each phase. Thus ""Lab Central"" is the nexus of atomic and space research in North America, so that it is also the logical place for a cosmic invasion of the earthly realm to begin. Yet even as the CEO falls under alien domination, his subalterns discover an anomalous ""asteroid"" that has assumed orbit around the earth, and, on their special equipment, they are able to deduce that it is other than a natural phenomenon. Screenwriter Lawrence Louis Goldman and director Kurt Neumann create a sense of human beings isolated in the large spaces of their desert laboratory; there is an especially claustrophobic ""vault"" where the center's main computer and many devices may be remotely accessed. The nicely calculated lighting, rich in shadow, contributes to this cloistered and oppressive effect. The most visually dramatic moment comes when a trio of scientists have gone to the Mexican shore near where the ""asteroid"" fell into the sea. The thing dubbed ""Kronos"" appears one morning on the beach, as tall as a skyscraper, sleek and metallic, able to move about on piston-like cylindrical legs. Its first act is to drain the energy from a Mexican power plant (true, the science is a bit shaky!) after which it begins a relentless, destructive march toward Los Angeles and environs, attracted by the nuclear weapons stored at the Port Hueneme naval base. The special effects, while minimal, are quite effective; the black-and-white medium supports them well, as does the efficient editing. The ending is a cliffhanger, not to be given away here. Outstanding is the alien character of the invader, manifest not only in the giant mechanism of ""Kronos"" (taking his name from a Titan), but in the human beings whom the mechanism's guiding mentality so brutally dispossesses of their proper identity. Jeff Morrow (who plays ""Exeter,"" an alien, in ""This Island Earth"") takes the leading role, as Dr. Lester Gaskell, backed up ably by Barbara Lawrence, John Emery (as the lab director), and the omnipresent Morris Ankrum, who more or less made a career in sci-fi second features. (Ankrum has a role in ""Earth versus the Flying Saucers."" ""Kronos"" has another link to ""EVFS."" Both boast location sequences filmed on the shore at Point Dume, in Malibu.) The writers give the players intelligent dialogue and the players take it all quite seriously. The DVD restores this film to its original wide screen format.
