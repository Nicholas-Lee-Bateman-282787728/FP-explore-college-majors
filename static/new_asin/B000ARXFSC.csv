8079212,5,B000ARXFSC,This last movie of the three seed movies is by far the best. A lot of details are closed over in the first two but because this movie covers a shorter amount of episodes a lot of story is maintained. As well the DVD and packaging is great for when you have all three. The magnetic lid works great and the box looks amazing in your shelf. Definitely a must have for anyone who wants to experience the final moments of seed again.,1394409600,,428,4.168674698795181
8079213,5,B000ARXFSC,Very nice it tells you about the a lot of a story in just a dvd. Still you got a lot of action as you spect on of a gundam series.,1352505600,,130,3.225806451612903
8079214,5,B000ARXFSC,Great for if you want to watch gundam seed quickly. Said used the disc had no markings or scratches played like it was brand new.,1312588800,,129,4.2
8079215,4,B000ARXFSC,"This movie covers the rest of the series, and because the amount of episodes are smaller than the other ones, makes it the best out of the three, simply because there wasn't so much to cram in.

Also if any of you plan to watch Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, then this movie is required to progress onward. The reason will explain itself later on. All in all Gundam SEED is one of the best animes ever and in terms of content this movie could be worth it if one is a completionist.

I kinda wish I didn't buy this, but I have it and that's that.",1239235200,,547,4.102803738317757
8079216,4,B000ARXFSC,"For most Gundam Seed fans the third movie will be their favorite, the main reason that it covers the least amount of episodes. Unlike the first two movies were entire episodes were ignored in the this movie that covers episodes 41-50 parts of each episode are featured.

Most of the new things not featured in the series were actually pretty good. A new flashback reveals that Muruta Azrael used to be just jealous of Coordiantors, it actually esculated to pure hatred because of his fanatical mother. A new scene shows Kira telling Lacus he doesn't think he was meant to exist and Lacus replying that he is and that by meeting him she's been a much happier woman and that she wants him to stay with her. Given their personalities these two clearly belong together and this scene clearly conveys that. When Rau Le Creuset's mask gets shot off we briefly get to see his face. It wasn't to big a deal, but it did make Mu La Flaga's reaction more powerful about who he really was. Instead of Yzak killing Clotho, the pilot of the Raider Gundam Dearka does. I don't know why they changed this but it doesn't really matter because it happens really fast in the movie, in a clip like manner. The only complaint I really have with this movie was skimming down the fight scenes with Orga, Shani and Clotho. Those goes guys may be cruel but they deliver great exciting fights.

The one great thing about all the movies is that unlike the series there's no time for repetitive flashbacks. Still all of them could be longer. I was actually pleased with some of things they chose to leave out. For one thing the preachy and overly optimistic dialogue. For instance Cagalli telling Athrun that his father will probably come around when they really got to talk. Even though many of the most intriguing moments of the series are featured in this movie this goes back to how one sided the plot became. Anyone who wasn't fighting on the side of Kira and Athrun was either portrayed as stupid (un-informed) or evil. That's why I tend to have a soft spot for villians in shows of this genere.

My favorite scenes typically featured Rau Le Creuset. Even though he was the villian his logic wasn't completely wrong. Kira's view towards people and the world in general was just a little to optimistic, given the use of Nuclear weapons by the Earth Alliance, Genesis by ZAFT and every other thing he witnessed up until now. I guess Rau Le Creuset and Kira both represent the extreme opposite view points. What was refreshing was how full of rage Kira was after Creuset killed Flay. At least in Gundam Seed his hands get dirty, he actually kills people (unlike later in Destiny) because it is a war after all. Except now he's fighting a war to end another war. Lacus Clyne goes as far as to tell Andrew Waltfeld not to aim for the cockpits when firing the The Eternal's weapons. She wants to bring about peace yet any normal person would be bitter and want payback after being humiliated, subdued like that on the Battlefield. So whether they kill or not hatred will persist once it's all over. The fact that Kira and Athrun's Gundams magically managed to stop every single nuke from hitting the Plants was a little to convient, unrealistic in a war situation for my taste. So since they actually kill some people makes them come off as human rather than Messiah's. Honestly Lacus Clyne points it out herself by stating, ""We call for peace, yet we have weapons in our hands."" If anything the soliders from both ZAFT and the Earth Forces probably found it condescending when Lacus with her preachy voice tells them to stop fighting.

Notice how I critique this show, it's because I like it so much. You really should screen this movie once if you're a Gundam fan. Even if you've already seen the series the new things are fun to see. The ending is the same as in the series with the song and everything, leaving you dieing to see what happens next in the Cosmic Era on Gundam Seed Destiny.",1218240000,5,3964,4.5476190476190474
8079217,5,B000ARXFSC,I love the bonus features on this DVD. It is shocking to see Le Cresseutte finally shows his true idenity you don't want to miss it. This is the last Gundam Seed movie and it is good. I think now it's time they should make a three disc gundam seed movie collection.,1150502400,,265,4.115384615384615
