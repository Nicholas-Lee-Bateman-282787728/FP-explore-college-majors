The film follows two couples through their decision making process to have, or not to have a baby. It also introduces many others who have chosen not to have children and provides their reasoning. The interviews were all interesting, thoughtful, and sincere. The filmmaker doesnt impose her own opinion throughout the movie. Rather, she presents a span of different points of view, along with some great historical information. The movie definitely got me thinking. Id highly recommend it!",1401580800,,731,4.895161290322581
