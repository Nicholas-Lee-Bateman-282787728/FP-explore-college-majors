You never know what you're going to get when you listen to a Jan Akkerman recording and this little DVD is a very small
snapshot of 2 jazz concerts in Germany. One loosely classified as 'acoustic', the other 'electric' both with the same backing
musicians and almost the same tracklisting on each concert. Definitely one for the fans and showcasing Jan's rather
unpredictable and exciting soloing. Known as a rather moody and introspective personality, Jan takes his band thru a few of
his 'standards' The interview with him is worth the price alone and shows him to be someone who does not want to be defined
by any style and one who has deliberately shunned 'celebrity' and 'fame' preferring instead to just be himself. I doubt whether
he ever plays his music the same way twice so every recording projects his mood and his uncanny gift to project personally
to his audience at that particular point in time. Now a more settled 'married with children' the tour around his music 'shed'
is quite revealing. He doesn't really like to acnowledge his 'influences' but Django Rheinhart gets a mention. The clip of him
dueting with Paco de Lucia is very interesting with Jan describing him as a 'God' Interestingly he says that he hasn't played,
in essence, any differently since he was 7 years old!
For anyone wanting an introduction to Jan Akkerman's music start with the self-titled 'Jan Akkerman' and 'Eli'
(written with and featuring Dutch poet Kaz Lux on vocals) both chock full of incredible tracks.
And of course anything by 'Focus' (try 'Moving Waves' and 'Focus 3')

8216998,5,B00014AQ0E,"My very first rock concert was Focus, and I was instantly mesmerized by the wonderful guitar work of Jan Akkerman...truly an unspoken superstar of the instrument. His virtuosity, sense of phrasing, and overall feel are incomparable, and his tasty chops make for some very memorable and ""catchy"" melodies I find myself sing along with in my head at random moments.
This DVD contains two concerts, both of which really shine with Jan's performance and the engaging work of his backup musicians.  For a guitarist, this is a marvel of masterful art, flawlessly painted before your eyes and ears in very intimate musical settings.  Any slinger of the stringed instrument can appreciate the efforts of this man, as well as his endurance of the business for so many years.
He knows he's good, and delivers with a smile.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys jazz/rock fusion and excellent instrumental mastery.",1284076800,3,915,5.006578947368421
