5531613,4,B00AZMFKNK,"I had been eagerly waiting to see ""Kon-Tiki"" for quite some time, and this weekend it finally opened at the local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I went to see it right away.

""Kon-Tiki"" (2012 release from Norway; original duration 118 min. US length approx. 95 min.) brings the story of how Norwegian scientist/esplorer Thor Heyerdahl wants to prove that Polunesia was first stlled by Peruvians, contrary to the accepted belief at that time. As the movie opens, we see young Thor already wanting to be a daredevil in hiw own backyard. Next we find Thor and his girlfrien/eventual wife Liv spending time in Polynesia in the late 1930s, and it is there that Thord gets the idea that Polynesia was settled by ""travelers from the east"" (which would be South America). Thor spends the next 10 years trying to prove this theory, until he is dared by a publisher to provide the ultimate proof: replicate the 5000 mile journey from Peru to Polynesia on a raft, the same way it was done 1500 years earlier. About half an hour into the movie, the journey begins, and what an epic journey it turns out to be. To tell you more would ruing your viewing pleasure.

Several comments: first and foremost, what is a great movie turns out to be a butchered version of the original (and Oscar-nominated) Norwegian version that was released last year to great acclaim (it is the highest grossing movie of all time in Norway). Indeed, all source materials (including info listed by the art-house theatre but also for example here on Amazon and on IMDb) list this as lasting 118 min. but what I saw today was barely over an hour and a half. After the movie was over, I asked to speak to the manager as I thought maybe something went wrong, but instead I was told that indeed the US version is a shortened version. The fact that some corporate suit at The Weinstein Company, the US distributor, decided the movie needed to be ""dumbed down' for US audiences just sickens me, and it has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I wouldn't be surprised if for the DVD release they'll include the ""extended"" (meaning, the original) version to entice you to spend yet more money.

The fact that we see a drastically shorter version of the original movie has tainted my overall judgment of ""Kon-Tiki"", which has all the makings of an excellent ""old school""-style adventure movie, with gorgeous photography and engaging performances. At this point you may wish to wait for the DVD release, rather than seeing it in the theatre, even though by all means a movie like this just begs to be seen on the big screen. A shame.",1370044800,65,2588,4.621739130434783
5531614,3,B00AZMFKNK,"The Andean story of how the world was created by a tall white, blue eyed man with long blond-reddish hair and beard who arose from Lake Titicaca in Bolivia has been passed down by word of mouth through generations of South American Indians. Known to the Aymaras as Viracocha (he was also called Kon-Tiki), Quetzalcoatl (by Aztecs), and Kukulkan (by Mayans), the story is similar to Biblical accounts of the creation of a race of giants who ruled the Earth but who displeased God and were destroyed by a flood. Unlike the God of Israel, however, Viracocha is said to have disappeared across the Pacific Ocean by walking on the water.

Norwegian Zoologist and explorer Thor Heyerdahl believed that Viracocha, rather than walking on the water, left Peru on a raft and floated with the current to Polynesia, a feat he wished to duplicate. (He did not consider the possibility of Viracocha's connection with the very ancient, advanced technological cultures of Tiahuanaco, Puma Punka, and Chavin de Huantar). Heyerdahl's accounts of how he and five other men built a balsa-wood raft which he named ""Kon-Tiki"" and sailed to the Tuamotu Archipelago in the South Seas is dramatized in Norwegian directors, Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg's Kon-Tiki, one of five nominated films in the Best Foreign Language Film category at this years' Oscars.

The film was shot in two versions, one in Norwegian and the other in English (the one I saw), presumably to appeal to a broader audience. Engagingly portrayed by Pal Sverre Hagen, Heyerdahl is first seen living with his wife Liv (Agnes Kittelsen) on the Polynesian island of Fatu Huku, where he resided for a year. After listening to native accounts, Heyerdahl began to develop the idea that Polynesians originally arrived from the Americas, not from Asia. Opting for adventure rather than character development, the film shows the courage (some call it being foolhardy, or even a death-wish) of the crew that consisted of three fellow Norwegians, as well as Swedish cameraman (Gustaf Skarsgard) and refrigerator salesman Herman Watzinger (Anders Baasmo Christiansen) as his engineer as they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Paciifc, isolated and alone for 101 days.

The film pays little attention to the day-to-day routine aboard the raft but concentrates on the thrill of the struggle against sharks, the fierce storms, conflict among the crew (contrary to Heyerdahl's own account), and the immediate danger of their raft collapsing. The photography, done without CGI effects such as in Life of Pi, is striking and beautiful, yet Kon-Tiki is mostly a formulaic adventure story that mimics the superficial triumphalism of Hollywood without capturing the deeper spirit of the journey. Heyerdahl's character is hardly explored and, while his subsequent travel to Easter Island is noted, there is no mention of his later advocacy of environmental issues and world peace.

While most scientists still oppose Heyerdahl's ideas and can show strong DNA evidence linking Polynesians to Asians, there are also anomalies that point in a different direction. For example, researcher David Pratt tells us that there are various genetic and cultural similarities between the Polynesians and the Tlingit, Kwakuitl and Haida Indians of Alaska and Canada - something not readily explained by any mainstream theories. In addition, there is the famous Kon-Tiki statue in the sunken Gardens in Tiahuanaco showing a man with a thick beard and mustache (South American Indians are beardless and do not shave).

One of the features of this and other statues in the area is the positioning of the hands, one over the heart and the other over the stomach, the same feature seen on Polynesian statues and gold medallions. Whatever the truth, there is no doubt that Thor Heyerdahl, through his willingness to take risks, brought the topic of seafaring, communication, and migration in the ancient world to people's attention, and deserves the appreciation he receives in the film. If Kon-Tiki can renew interest in man's pre-history, it will have served a very valuable purpose.",1370044800,4,4101,5.17948717948718
5531615,5,B00AZMFKNK,"Neither the book, nor the amateur first film mentions it much, and this new film only briefly touches on it, but several of the Kon-Tiki crew were heroes of the first order, not even counting this marvelous expedition. Knut Haugland (the ""radio operator"") was one of Norway's greatest WWII heroes, leading the fight against the Nazi's and also sabotaging their early work with Atomic energy.  Knut was given a number of Knighthoods and orders. They don't make men like this anymore. Torstein Raaby (the other radio guy) helped sink the Tirpitz and was a noted arctic explorer.

Now, the original film is a fantastic feat and won the Academy Award for best Documentary in 1951. Well deserved. But it's all in hand-held B&W, rather grainy.

However, this new film is in glorious color, and the blue of the sea has to be seen and appreciated. This new film has fantastic cinematography , and the actors are (more or less) dead ringers for the real crew members. Using all local actors the Norwegians lent a great deal of verisimilitude to this breathtakingly beautiful film. It was also nominated for a Oscar.

Even tho the dangers here are mostly staged, rather than real, the film was shot on the open ocean, and it shows.

Just beautiful.",1369008000,8,1238,4.766355140186916
5531616,5,B00AZMFKNK,"I just saw the latest Kon Tiki film that debuted in 2012
at the Nashville Film Festival.  It was an inspiring film
that brought out raw emotion for the six men that made the
101 day journey together. Thor was a calm leader that kept
his wits about him even under the toughest of conditions.
And it was incredible that he could not swim! I am not sure
if all of the facts are true in this film, but it was
extremely well done.  The actors are fantastic and engaging.
Truly one of our modern day adventurers, Thor Heyedahl had
a vision that he shared with the world.  This is a must see
movie.  Even if you doubt his theory that South Americans
crossed the Pacific to land in Polynesia, the story is one
that you will enjoy and keep you on the edge of your seat!",1366588800,26,760,4.149659863945578
5531617,4,B00AZMFKNK,"A Norwegian-filmed dramatization of Thor Heyerdahl's legendary expedition across the Pacific Ocean on a flimsy wooden raft. Lovingly constructed and beautifully filmed with a sharp eye for the grandiose, it's eye candy on the same level as Planet Earth, if to a slightly more reasonable scale. The plot is a gentle balance between nature-watching and temper-managing, as the crew of six men and a parrot get to know a bit too much about one another over the course of their hundred-day adventure. Several of the journey's more dramatic moments feel manufactured (and, upon review, actually are) but I'd hardly call that unexpected and it may have been necessary to give the story a bit of punch. After all, where's the excitement in watching two hours of smooth sailing against a tropical horizon? It's an uplifting tale, if not an especially challenging one, and excellent fuel for escapist daydreams. Definitely worth catching on Blu-Ray if you're as big on our planet's sights and sounds as I am.",1361145600,47,999,5.024096385542169
5531678,3,B00AZMFKNK,"FAR too much Hollywood BS for such a great tale. Watch the documentary from 1950. Despite the age, I couldn't take my eyes off it - it was fantastic! This thing was okay in some spots, but much of it was inaccurate, and pretty ridiculously overblown. Yes, there were sharks following the boat, but they were medium-sized reef sharks, not gargantuan, swarming, blood-thirsty megalodons - there are no giant bioluminescent creatures - the whale shark was like 3x larger than it should have been - plus they wanted to show it as a more current tale, so they left out the idea that ""everyone"" was freaked out by the whale shark and they were also scared of the giant scary and dangerous whales. They really wanted to highlight Thor as a hero, so in true Hollywood fashion, they have everyone doubting him constantly throughout the whole movie, and everyone was fighting, there was an idiot onboard, etc. ...general Hollywood garbage that takes a great true story and tarnishes it with overblown nonsense to increase the ""wow-factor"".",1512172800,,1029,4.8522727272727275

5531684,3,B00AZMFKNK,"Much preferred the original docu from 1951.
This one had some irritating politically correct crap that I found annoying. Like what, you ask?
The little chat between two of the crew about things that happened during the War about which, apparently, one was having some remorse and feelings of guilt. For instance, mentioning Torstein Raaby's involvement in the blowing up the of German warship the Tirpitz where ""One thousand men went down.""
And how he, personally,  had shot four Germans...probably SS....when they caught him with his wireless.
Norway endured horrendous cruelty and war crimes under Nazi occupation; the Norwegians were among the toughest soldiers of that war and I seriously doubt that a survivor of occupied Norway would be sitting around whining about things that put an end to one of the most ruthless regimes in history and saved millions of lives.",1498435200,,870,5.126760563380282
5531685,5,B00AZMFKNK,"KON-TIKI is a delightful color film, taking place in Norway, Washington DC (National Geographic Society), Peru (Callao, Peru), Raroia in Tuamotu Islands, with most of the film taking place in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  The film documents the proposal of Thor Heyerdahl to fund a journey across the Pacific Ocean, starting from Peru, and finishing anywhere in Polynesia. Thor Heyerdahl is played by Pal Sverre Hagen, who is fluent in Norwegian and in English.

SHORT VERSION VERSUS LONG VERSION.  Parts of the movie were filmed twice, once with the actors speaking in English and a second time, with them speaking Norwegian (but speaking in English when they are in New York or in Washington DC).  The product comes with two DVDs, a shorter version in English and a longer version in Norwegian with English subtitles.  I watched both versions.  There is really little difference.  The longer version includes more scenes with Heyerdahl's wife.  For example, the longer version shows a letter that was given to Heyerdahl immediately after he reached Polynesia --  the letter was from the wife and was kept by one of the sailors on the raft, during the entire voyage  --  and in the letter, the wife tells her husband that she is dumping him.  And so, for viewers interested in seeing a famed explorer being dumped by his wife, then I recommend seeing the longer version.  Actually, the longer version, which has English subtitles, enables you better to understand some of the dialogue which, in the English-only short version, is indistinct on a rare occasion.  The only indistinct part is in the opening minutes, where Norwegian children are playing on a frozen lake.

STUNNINGLY CLEVER.  A few scenes of this movie are stunningly clever.  One scene, which is an absolute work of art, is where Mr. Heyerdahl approaches a publisher for his new book.  The publisher is derisive and dismissive of the book proposal, and informs Heyerdahl that many, many books are published about theories of history, and where only ten people buy the book, and where nobody believes what is in the book. (This scene occurs early in the movie.)  Of course, what eventually happened, is that Heyerdahl's book in real-life sold millions and millions of copies.  Another clever scene, is where Heyerdahl seeks funding in Peru, apparently from a government official.  Heyerdahl is waiting inside a palace, and a man dressed in a pompous royalty uniform walks by.  ""Your Excellency,"" says Heyerdahl, greeting him, thinking that he is the King of Peru.  But the man just walks by.  Another man dressed in a pompous royal uniform walks by, and Heyerdahl greets him, saying, ""Your Excellency.""  But the man just walks by (apparently, just another security guard).  Then, Heyerdahl goes out into the garden to wait, and a short man dressed in a simple white suit approaches.  Heyerdahl thinks he is a servant and he says, ""I'll just have a glass of water.""  But the man in the white suit is a government official (or the King of Peru, it is not made clear).  A second later, the man in the white suit tells Heyerdahl that he is pleased with his theory that Polynesia was settled by Peruvians, and he provides funding to build the raft.  Truly, this is scene should be included in a list of the 100-most clever scenes ever committed to film.

The initial minutes of the movie show Thor Heyerdahl, as a boy, doing foolish and daring things in the wintertime in Norway, where he hops from one block of free-floating ice to another block of free-floating ice on a lake.  This same technique was used in TUSKEGEE AIRMAN, where Cuba Gooding was first shown as a boy interested in airplanes, and where the bulk of the movie shows Cuba Gooding as an adult airplane pilot.  Also, this same technique was used in MEN OF HONOR, where Cuba Gooding was first shown as a boy interested in swimming and diving, and where the bulk of the movie shows Cuba Gooding as an adult deep-sea diver.

The next episode of KON-TIKI shows Thor Heyerdahl in his efforts to acquire funding for his proposed expedition across the Pacific Ocean.  Executives a National Geographic Society in Washington DC treat him with derision, but Thor Heyerdahl's passion for his proposal is undampened.  The episode with executives at National Geographic Society is played with extraordinary skill and realism.  The acting in this part of KON-TIKI, and in fact, in the entire movie, is done with monumental finesse and realism.  During his efforts to acquire funding, Thor Heyerdahl is approached by a refrigeration salesman and mechanical engineer, played by chubby Anders Baasmo.  The engineer wants to join the expedition, and he is invited to join.  Eventually, funding to build the boat arrives, apparently because a man in Peru's government is intrigued by the notion that ancient Peruvians had discovered the Polynesian islands.

Most of the 90-minute English version of the movie takes place on the Pacific Ocean.  On the one hand, the various events taking place on the boat could be viewed as series of conventional cliff-hangers that are strung together.  These events take the form of: (1) A furious thunderstorm at night where the sail gets ripped; (2) Sharks; (3) Panic by the tubby refrigeration engineer, because he thinks that the boat is getting water-logged and will sink soon; (4) More sharks, (5) Loss of helium balloon needed for a high-altitude radio antenna; (5) Even more sharks; (6) Problem of the boat being ripped into shreds in shallow waters by sharp-edged coral.  But on the other hand, it is never the case that the movie seems episodic, and it is never the case that the movie seems that is made from recycled cliff-hangers from other movies about perils of sea voyages.  The movie is captivating and compelling, because it emphasizes human nature, dedication, and courage.  Of course, there are hundreds of other stories in motion pictures and in books about facing adversity at sea.  But the story foremost in my mind while watching KON-TIKI was the voyage of  Ernest Shackleton and his crew in the sailing ship, the Endurance, and his associated voyage in a small sailboat, the James Caird.

MUSIC.  The music in parts features synthesizer music that is similar to that in NEVER CRY WOLF (music by Mark Isham).  The synthesizer music in both films is somewhat forlorn.  Both films concern a lone scientist that went against the grain, where the lone scientists proposed theories not held by others.  Hence, the use of forlorn synthesizer music in both films was an interesting coincidence.",1496102400,,6558,4.9091734786557675

I should say that the theory that motivated this book is probably wrong. Just because you can prove that the American Indians could cross the Pacific Ocean in a balsawood raft does not mean that they did it. Few experts today think that is how the Pacific was colonized although its possible that some Indians did the journey.",1487289600,,545,4.505050505050505

5531948,5,B00AZMFKNK,"I first heard about Heyerdahl back in high school and in college I read some of his intriguing books. But I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this film.

This is a great adventure story told with intelligence. The ensemble cast is excellent. Production values are top notch front to back. Beautifully photographed with a fine score. The visual effects are seamless and they all enhance the story. The image and sound quality is first rate -- really doesn't get much better than this.

There are a number of extras and they're all good. I wish they would have included Heyerdahl's original documentary film, which won an Oscar for Best Documentary in 1951.

This is an excellent and very highly recommended!

ps If there is any flaw in the presentation it's the disc cover graphic which looks like a throw away from some reality show. Visually, it makes little sense for this film. Don't judge a film by its cover. Anchor Bay tripped up here. They should have used one of the original movie posters, perhaps something like this which is more reflective of the film's subject -- http://thebenshi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1.jpg",1420156800,,1144,4.942708333333333
5531949,3,B00AZMFKNK,"""Kon-Tiki"", by Thor Heyerdahl, is one of my all-time favorite books, but this movie, alas, did not live up to the book's standards. Part of the problem was the lead, Pal Sverre Hagen; while he wasn't necessarily bad, he didn't come close to embodying Heyerdahl's impressive zeal, good humor, and leadership qualities. This isn't entirely his fault; the script didn't help, choosing to focus on a made-up bit of drama (was Heyerdahl right in theorizing that the current and trade winds would carry the Kon-Tiki to the South Pacific, or was the raft destined just to drift out to sea?) and then parlaying this into a conflict amid the crew. The film would have done better just to focus on the sheer adventure of the Kon-Tiki's voyage; there is enough of that to fill two reels, if they're shot well. And that was the other problem: much of this film looked as if it was shot in a bathtub. I'd recommend the actual black-and-white footage of the real Kon-Tiki epic over this reproduction. You get to see Heyerdahl and his crew in action, and even the lack of color doesn't take away from the wonders they encounter as they drift from South America to the South Pacific under the billowing sail with ancestor-god Kon-Tiki's red-bearded face painted on it.",1419465600,7,1252,4.7214611872146115

The main character who has a wife and kids, calls her up and says he won't be home; has to go on this trip to cross the Pacific and never returns to his family.

5532070,3,B00AZMFKNK,"This is a missed opportunity to tell the story of the Norwegian explorer who set sail on a balsa wood raft in 1947 from the west coast of Latin America, trying to prove that ancient men could have traveled this way to Polynesia in the middle of the Pacific. It starts off well with Thor Heyerdahl and his wife on the Polynesian islands before World War Two, increasingly curious about how they were initially colonised. His wife falls sick and when they hear the sound of the steamer coming in, Heyerdahl grabs his wife and runs through the rain, not caring that her biological work is ruined. Sub-text: he is a selfish man. After the war he breaks a promise to return to Norway from New York (remember: he's selfish) and instead grabs a crew in haphazard fashion and ends up in Peru with a bunch of balsa wood logs he has to lash together. This is where the problems in the script start: we know the raft made it, so there's no suspense there. We therefore need a great group dynamic and we don't get it. There are seven men on board and they all have flimsy back stories and they all look alike. So when tensions rise it's hard to figure out who is upset with whom, especially as the beards grow longer, and even harder to raise much enthusiasm. There should be a couple of great back stories and psychological traumas and we suffer from their absence. The tale drags and drags and it's a relief when they finally make shore. Heyerdahl receives a letter from his wife saying she is leaving him because he is so selfish. There is no subtlety in this film at all.",1401321600,4,1563,4.393103448275862

5532072,4,B00AZMFKNK,"I read the book Kon-Tiki last year, and found it so fascinating that I was interested in seeing a film treatment. If this film is your only exposure to the true story of the adventures of Thor Heyerdahl and the crew of the Kon-Tiki, I would highly advise that you read the book also. Though the film outlines the major aspects of the adventure, there's so much missing that it seems like a pallid imitation of the real adventure. You don't really get to know any of the characters in detail other than Thor, and you also don't get an accurate picture of what it was like to build the raft and spend 101 days drifting slowly across the Pacific. The book also continues with what happened after they landed in Polynesia, and that's almost entirely omitted from the film. It could easily be a 2 or 2.5 hour documentary, but the film-makers chose to shorten it too much. I recommend the film as a supplement to the book, but not as a substitute.",1398038400,,941,4.413793103448276

It doesn't have tons of action, but is a wonderful example of loyalty among friends, working together, and how humans can triumph over just about anything with planning, training, wisdom, and perseverance.",1397260800,,563,4.755102040816326

This is a new production which may as well have been a stage play. The acting is good but it's all about the characters and dialog, not the actual adventure on the water. When it is on the water it's not at all realistic. ALL of the (computer-generated) sharks are large great whites for some cinematic reason, but in real life GW's travel at great depth when crossing large stretches of open ocean. In reality oceanic whitecaps and blue sharks would predominate near the surface but guess what (?), this clearly wasn't filmed in open ocean. Most likely the filming was conducted just offshore -- there are no ocean swells, just CGI.

In most cases, such as Pearl Harbor, you know it is CGI, and forgive it because it is vastly superior to cardboard models in front of painted back drops.  In this case you often don't realize it is CGI, and when you know it is CGI it is used to give the real feeling of what it's like to be on a tiny raft in the Pacific.  My only criticism is that the film makes Herman Watzinger a weak sister, which he was not.

Because I haven't read the book,  I can't say if the movie followed the true story or not.  I can say that I enjoyed the pace of the movie and appreciated how it sounded on my home theater with a recently upgraded subwoofer.  The english version is short, about an hour and a half, but is a good adventure story.

My 10 year-old daughter watched the entire movie with me (though we fast-forwarded through a bloody scene at the 1 hour mark).  Because we got a late start and her bedtime came to soon after we began, we watched in two sittings -- the first 30 minutes (when financing and crew were being secured) followed by the rest.  I was surprised that she came back since the first half hour was mainly dialogue; but, I had told her the basic plot so I think that helped keep her interest. After it was over she said that she really liked it.

My 6 1/2 year-old son did't stick around too long during the first 30 minutes (dialogue); but, he did sit still for the entire second sitting.  The fact that he sat still says a lot and I was quite surprised.

Over all, a great adventure story and good family movie.  I recommend skipping a few minutes at the 1-hour mark (english version) if younger children are watching.  There is also *some* mild profanity but nothing too concerning.",1388880000,3,1511,4.411552346570397

5532243,5,B00AZMFKNK,"Let me deal with a few technical matters first: The Norwegian audio version on the Blu-ray disc runs for 2 hours, the English dub for only 96 minutes. I have not examined what was cut but I did try the dub in parts and the mix of accents sent me quickly back to the Norwegian, (which has a lot of English in it too). The DVD is not a full copy, it only contains the shorter English dub not the full length Norwegian version.
The film however is an astonishing achievement and follows the book surprisingly closely. The whale shark and shark incidents are over-cooked for dramatic effect as compared to the book and the throwing out of the wire never happened as far as I could see. The unfortunate parrot was not eaten by a shark but just swamped by a wave. Despite this making such a film in the open ocean was no easy task and despite the large amount of CGI it comes over very well. The acting is good and the picture and sound excellent. All in all this is a fascinating relook at a subject that is still unresolved. Heyerdahl makes numerous points that cannot be brushed away. Perhaps we will never know the truth but this astonishing, almost foolhardy voyage should  certainly light the fire of adventure in us all. I met Heyerdahl years later on Easter Island and he presents his theories with tremendous conviction.

It tells the incredible true story of explorer Thor Heyerdahl, who drifted from Peru to Oceania on nothing but a balsa-wood raft. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The cinematography is grand and sweeping, with vibrant colors, deep blues, and rich greens. The period detail is rich and polished, though the language switch between English and Swedish may be slightly jarring  for some. At its heart, Kon-Tiki is an adventure story  one without much special effects, one with a human story at heart, filmed on the open sea, with a few amazing set pieces, great acting, and a star turn from Pl Sverre Hagen (65 of pure Norway!) as Thor Heyerdahl.

While it may be slightly formulaic, and more than a little predictable, Kon-Tiki is a rousing, blood-pumping, visually stunning adventure film, crafted with style. What more can be said?

5532414,5,B00AZMFKNK,"After Norwegian adventurer/scientist Thor Heyerdahl spent years in Polynesia, he became convinced that the islands were originally founded and inhabited by people from South America, specifically Peru.  This was contrary to the belief at the time that settlers came from Asia.

In 1947, Heyerdahl and his 5 man crew set out to prove that the 5000 mile trip could be made on a raft supported by balsa wood.  He was successful, wrote a book and made an Oscar winning documentary (in 1950) about the trip.  This dramatic film uses both mediums and some interviews with Heyerdahl's son to recreate the adventure.  This film co-directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg and produced by Aage Aaberge had financial support from over 20 entities and became the largest budgeted film to ever come from Norway.  It was rightly nominated for Best Foreign Language Film based on the longer 119 minute Norwegian language version.

Harvey Weinstein agreed to release the film in the U. S. but only with an English language version with a shorter running time.  So the filmmakers shot two versions of the film at the same time.  The actors spoke both Norwegian and English, so they would shoot scenes twice.  Both versions are available on this disc and both include subtitles in English, Spanish and English SDH using unique display methodology.

I only watched the longer Norwegian version and while it is primarily in Norwegian, there are also extended scenes in English when Heyerdahl is in New York trying to get financing and in Peru as he communicates in the only common language.  I don't know what was excised in the English language version.  Even if I watched it, it would likely have to be done side-by-side to catch the differences.  I didn't have the time, equipment or resources to do it.  Evidently nobody else did either.  I spent some time surfing the web to see if anyone had ascertained what 23 minutes got cut, but could find no one who had gone to the trouble either.

With a film as beautiful as this one, there is no reason not to watch the original Norwegian version.  The filmmakers used a combination of ""at sea"" shooting and digital CGI.  The CGI scenes range from just OK (shots of the NYC skyline) to remarkable (the whale shark...and other sharks).  The Blu ray comes in the original 2.39:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  It is stunning.  Colors are vibrant.  Contrast and clarity are exemplary.  This similarly themed film compares favorably to the visuals of ""The Life of Pi.""

The Norwegian language version comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is as good as it comes.  There is one scene I remember when the raft is being turned around as sea and the sound circles the room as the raft moves.  Very effective.  As good as it is, boy this would have been even better in 7.1.  If you watch the English language version you will get a lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track.  Extras include a 26 minute featurette called Kon-Tiki: The Incredible True Story and a 10 minute music only featurette called Visual Effects showing some of the photography tricks used in filming.

I haven't said much about the story.  Pal Sverre Hagen stars as Heyerdahl and does a remarkable job.  He even looks like Thor.  Even with a wife and children at home in Norway, Heyerdahl is focused on the man vs. nature element as well as proving that his theory is correct.  The only other performances of consequence are the 5 shipmates and they are credible in their performances.  The direction, photography and editing are likewise superb.  The film has enough tension and suspense to keep audiences awake.  There are sharks of course.  There is the raft coming apart.  There is bickering at sea in the 101 day trip.  There are violent storms.  And did I mention...sharks!  This is a well-made, near perfect adventure.  Highly recommended on Blu ray.",1378252800,5,3854,4.774242424242424

5532419,5,B00AZMFKNK,"I know there are already a number of reviews of the FILM posted, and I'll refer you to those for the story line and acting. I'll use this space to discuss the DVD and BD versions.  This is another instance of the Weinstein Company and Anchor Bay going the extra distance to put a lot into the home video release of a film that only received limited theatrical release.

As you will learn from my fellow Amazon reviewer Paul Allaer, the US theatrical version was edited down from 119 minutes to 96 minutes. It was the longer version - in Norwegian with English Subtitles - that was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Foreign Feature Film. What you get on both the DVD and the BD version are BOTH that original as well as the English language version - which will  give the film greater exposure. Whichever version you choose, it is the visual images that will grab you the most. The BD version looked great on my new flat screen TV. There were a few sound issues however with the volume dropping off in a few places. I'm not sure it this was in the transfer or not. (This was in the English version.). The special effects (mostly CGI created) are quite heavy, but very realistic. (One of the two ""bonus features"" is a nine-minute ""Visual Effects Featurette"" which shows the images before and after the CGI effects, with no narration; just a musical soundtrack.)

The other bonus is a 25 minute ""program"" on the expedition that Thor Heyerdahl made in 1947 and subsequent book and film versions. It appears to have been made for a television show.

Having recently returned from a vacation in Norway, I was  anxious to see this film (which seemed to have passed through Philadelphia quickly on its theatrical run.). I found it both historically interesting and well-acted, especially when there were no identifiable ""stars"" to distract me from the story.

UPDATE 8/28/13: I just checked my combo pack and noted that the DVD included has only the English language version. The BD in the combo has both. I do not know if the stand alone DVD set has the Norwegian version but I doubt it, because a single DVD can not hold that much info.

FURTHER UPDATE - 8/29/13 - A commenter (see comments) confirmed that the DVD version is also a TWO_disc set and does contain both Emnglish and Norwegian version. (I only had the BD Combo pack when I posted my review)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5532420,5,B00AZMFKNK,"I recently saw this movie at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. The start of the movie was delayed in lieu of the HUGE crowd of people waiting in line to buy a ticket in the hot sun. They had three showings, and when I went on Sunday it was the last showing. When the movie started there were only a handful of empty seats, which is very rare for the OMOA. I have seen many docudrama's on TV about events at the turn of the 19th century. The entire set, cars, planes, and clothing date back to that age. That also applies to this movie. One thing I loved about this movie is they also told the story leading up to the launch of Kon Tiki. The film made it very clear that the entire crew knew this was a very dangerous voyage. Yet knowing that everyone of the crew had no doubt about going on the voyage. That is the entire scientific community predicted it was a suicide mission. Everyone on the Kon Tiki was assigned to a task, navigator, radio operator, engineer, photographer, etc. The real story is about mother earth and what she had in store for the crew of  the Kon Tiki. There was not one dull moment in this movie. The epic fights among the crew. The scenes of joy, laughter, and extreme danger. The main theme is about several guys that had nothing in common, and as the voyage progresses they banded together as mates.
 IMDB advised that there are four scenes that did not actually take place on the 1947 voyage, and that the movie is not historically accurate. They say this was done to beef up to movie, and make it more melodramatic. I will have to agree with Hollywood this time. Those four scenes did not change the outcome of the voyage in anyway, and only made it more entertaining.
 Another note is that this docudrama was so....good when it played at the Oklahoma Museum of Art that at the end of the movie everyone in the theatre stood up and applauded. And YES I did purchase the Blu-Ray DVD from Amazon.",1376092800,,1924,4.30939226519337

So, do we need a film re-creating the 101 days on the open sea? For their historical adventure drama, directors team Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg put more focus on the personalities of the crew including Heyerdahl (Pl Sverre Valheim Hagen), and Heyerdahl's wife Liv (Agnes Kittelsen). The film shows the great achievement of the explorer as well as the price he had to pay for that.

While the greatest asset of the Norwegian film (nominated both for Golden Globe and Oscar) is its convincing visual effects and production design, some parts of the story seem dramatized and exaggerated, especially the scenes involving animals.

But for all its flaws, ""Kon-Tiki"" manages to capture the spirit of the adventure that still attracts us today.",1373932800,2,1110,5.155555555555556

It's showing hardly anywhere; only two theaters in the New York area, presumably because although I saw the English version of the movie, it still counts as a 'foreign film'.  So I'm glad it's also available on DVD for those of you who are interested and unable to find a showing. I went with my dad, and we both LOVED (loved, loved, LOVED) it. Although we all know the outcome, it nevertheless kept us on the edge of our seats. The performances were terrific (esp. from the guy with the weird name who plays Thor Heyerdahl), the cinematography was sumptuous, and it is hard not to feel terribly emotional at the end when Thor falls to his knees in the sand of a Polynesian island and realized that he has proven his theory (and that's not a 'spoiler', surely??? I mean, EVERYONE knows what Thor Heyerdahl did!)

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a secret adventurer at heart.",1370217600,,946,4.494186046511628

8559778,2,B00AZMFKNK,"Hastily put together and arranged it seems like a desperate man's attempt to prove himself all the time, on every level, every day. He's shown in the opening scenes misunderstanding his Islander subjects, if in no other way than personality and character. For an ethnographer that's odd. And his wife seems to know them better.  Possibly how it's portrayed here is in essence how the plan came together but the sense of urgency is distracting . His wife seems particularly clingy and unforgiving and manipulative. Her conversation on the phone with him as he expresses his desires shows her as impractical and unsupportive, and ignorant of her place in their marriage. (how's he supposed to care for her, the kids and his crew while navigating this dangerous, untried, admittedly insane adventure? He'd be criminally negligent to include her and them.) He's forever behind the 8-ball in this film, perpetually negotiating from positions of weakness. Beautifully filmed.",1520380800,,969,5.211538461538462
