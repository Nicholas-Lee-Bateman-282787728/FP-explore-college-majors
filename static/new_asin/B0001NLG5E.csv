8015363,1,B0001NLG5E,Very expensive and poor Quality copied from black market to be this bad,1469664000,,71,4.538461538461538
8015364,5,B0001NLG5E,"Good fun, but that's fashion. Models showing off for the camera.
Watch the first 20 minutes to see a dancer strutting her stuff.
She's good, real good, so good.
A dark straight haired beauty with a blue leotard, red leg warmers, white shoes, red belt and red and blue sweat band.
I love it.",1416614400,,290,4.388888888888889
8015365,4,B0001NLG5E,"This is a movie from the early '80's that takes a (semi-fictional?) look inside the world of modeling.  Paulina Porizkova figures prominently in the film, as does Kelly Emberg, Carol Alt and Julie Wolf.  It's a fun movie to have and has some great music in it as well from the era.",1243123200,2,281,4.384615384615385
8015366,4,B0001NLG5E,"Don't miss the chance to see this film! Can be relished by any fan of models or 80's music. Brilliant piece of 80's history caught on film. Paulina at age 17! These real life soon to be super models star in this slice-of-life and  behind-the-scenes look at international modeling world as seen through the eyes of the ""new girl"" JULIE WOLFE.  She caught the eye of  Elite modeling agency head of ""new talent."" Now shes on her way to international stardom. ""Portfolio"" is a  Feature length film thats NOT a documentary. However, it does take place at real photo shoots with famous fashion photographers and the real runway shows of  PERRY ELLIS and ALAIA. Not that different at all from the ""manipulated reality"" type shows as seen today on MTV and VH1. In fact certain aspects of this film are incredibly similar to ""The Hills."" With plenty of Back-Talking, Trash-mouthing, gossiping and jealously. Still, its not that much of an expose of the dark-side of modeling. Its semi-critical but mostly glamorous. With clients and make-up artists poking and prodding.
Most awesome of all are the 80's shots of NYC and of course the incredible collection of 80's music the likes of which could never be assembled today in any one film. The music budget alone would easily be 10 times what it cost to make this film. Must have something to do with the fact that this was released by SONY on VHS. Music includes at least 14 hit 80's song many almost in their entirety. Features  Eurythmics, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner (  Joe Cocker, Missing Persons with ""Destination Unkown"" and many more. Watch for cameo of ANDY WARHOL and fashion illustrator ANTONIO. Plus Bronx Breakdancers The Rock Steady Crew !",1207958400,4,1688,4.780068728522337
