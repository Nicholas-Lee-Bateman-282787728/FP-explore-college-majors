172473,4,0965045064,"When this film was made in 1985 there was so little information about riding, everything it contains was new to most riders back then. So much more is known now on how to ride and there are many better ways to film them. What amazed me when I looked at it again recently was the things it shows that were never intended in the original script. Looking at the things I would change about it was really helpful in making the Twist, Vol II book into a more powerful rider communication. The new DVD is light years ahead for sure but I don't think it would have been as good without the understanding that was gained from the original. The first one is really corny, I have to laugh when I think about it. The only good thing is that all the points it covers still apply to riding. I have no regrets on making it and I'm always very happy when people write me and tell me that it helped them see more about riding. I don't love it but I still like it.

172474,1,0965045064,"I'll go further than most and say this is pretty useless, even for beginners. Showing racing lines in overhead shots is better done watching Speed Channel. The concentration needed to ride is discussed, and worthy of about 2 minutes explanation. You would expect more about techniques, and maybe some stuff taught at the schools. This DVD, rightly or wrongly, made me decide NOT to go to Keith Code school.",1251504000,2,406,4.898550724637682
172475,3,0965045064,"This video was informative; but it was very dated.  Circa early 1980s.  I have subsequently taken a couple training courses which cover newer material and techniques.  Not negating the TotW video; but buyers should be informed that the video is dated.  It also lacks clarity and focus on a couple points in that the dramatization and attempts at ""humor"" obscure the technical points they are making.

It is precisely what you should expect out of a 1980's motorcycle superbike training school that appears to have self produced a video for the first time.

I paid ~$24 with shipping and think the video is worth about half that price.",1246752000,,634,4.824074074074074
172476,2,0965045064,"I love the series of books but this DVD falls down. The material and footage is dated. The shots do not nearly go far enough to take advantage of really letting us see what is being discussed. When this was shot that was probably due to equipment limitations. It is really, realllly time to update this with much more extended and closer footage. This medium could be the icing on the cake for the series but it's really more the box you throw away to get to the books...",1188518400,3,471,4.303370786516854
172477,1,0965045064,"This dvd is terrible. I bought it in the hopes that it would be presented differently than his books, but it is just the same. Keith uses ten-cent euphmisms like ""products"" and ""points of timing"" and whatnot, when all he is talking about is negotiating a turn. Pick your braking point, your turn in, and go. Simple. Faster the better.

Keith has a promising career in middle management ahead of him.

Also, the ""humorous"" bits and the pauses between them account for WAY too much of this vid.",1181952000,2,492,4.579545454545454
172478,3,0965045064,"The information contained in the video is good. The info will be useful for new riders and people that are trying to focus more on how to corner.

The one thing I wasn't happy about was the lack of instruction on how to do things better. They do a great job of telling you what to do and what not to do, but don't spend time on telling you how to do it. In lots of situations they tell you to figure out what works best for you. I thought the focus of the video should have been on teaching us what Keith knew and what he would do.

As for the quality of the video it was poor. The video was shoot in the 80s and the production of the video is poor by today's standards. To say it needs updating is an understatement.

All that being said you will learn how to be a better rider if you watch this video.",1173916800,7,803,3.914110429447853
172479,1,0965045064,"First of all, it's old, so the of course it's going to be cheesy.  I was willing to look past that.  But most of the DVD shows guys drawing how they're going to enter a turn and to pick out certain points in the road... they repeat it over.. and over....and over... and over.. I had to stop the DVD before I even made it half way through.  I finally decided to start watching it again the next day.. and guess what?.. more drawing!  I have learned more watching videos on YouTube than I did from this video - nothing.",1173744000,3,517,4.14
172480,5,0965045064,"This product is usefull for beginners, however, the same concepts IMO can be learned from reading the book, a Twist of the wrist.  I sat through and watched the DVD for the full length, I am not sure if i picked up anything by watching a graphic version of the book, which is basically what this is.",1169683200,4,299,4.245614035087719

7793772,3,0965045064,"This video is old and dated, but the basic information is timeless.  So if you can get past the 80's garb, you will learn.  If you have been riding for over a year, my I highly recommend ""Twist of the Wrist II"" video not the book.  I've been riding for 14 years and I watch the ""Cornering Bible"" before every track day.  I still learn from it.",1324684800,,343,4.074626865671642
7793773,4,0965045064,"I bought this for advice on how to ride with more confidence. It has certainly given me that with just the first viewing. It you are looking for a DVD with great acting and excellent production then get a life!!! (maybe get a copy of Easy Rider!!) This is about how to ride a bike properly and it does that with ease, with great tips on just about every aspect of riding. The only thing that I found was that it is directed more towards racing, picking lines and powering out of corners (great fun) which is not that easy when you are cruising down an unknown road!!! But all in all I have found it extremely helpful and my riding confidence and skills have increased massively. I also bought the book and it makes a great companion to reference back to certain points.
For riding tips I give it 4 stars",1322784000,2,803,4.2894736842105265
7793774,4,0965045064,"picked up this dvd because ive heard a decent amount about it on a forumn im on.  a bit outdated( made in 1990 or something)  but the information is great. helps for those looking to get started  into track riding, but some very valuable information for beginner riders as well.",1297728000,,278,4.52
