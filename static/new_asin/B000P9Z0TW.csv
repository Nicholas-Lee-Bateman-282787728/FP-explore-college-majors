Drugs like cytoxan, methotrexate and taxotere have put MILLIONS of women into remission from their breast cancers. Me included. This quacky women HAS  NEVER and WILL NEVER be able to document that she has CURED anyone from metastatic cancer. Don't believe her when she states that she herself had metastatic cancer. She has never proved that through any medical records to date. She has embellished her testimonial and was put into remission by lumpectomy with clean margins. She has taken her great grand luck in not getting a recurrence and LIED to dupe other breast cancer patients into buying all her goodies and books and videos. In my opinion, she is one of the most diabolical humans alive today. Shameful quack.",1390521600,,790,4.9772727272727275
