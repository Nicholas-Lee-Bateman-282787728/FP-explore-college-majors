7414008,5,B014KEP8M6,"RAIL WARS is addictive. You wouldn't expect a lot from a story about  the Japanese National Railway, but this a really clever 12-part series with lots of action and excellent characters. Takayama is the key character and is totally obsessed about the JNL. He's a walking almanac on trains, but very dense about social relationships. He joins with three others to form a team that is the core of the story. First girl character,  Aoi, is the daughter of a police detective and is an expert in judo and marksmanship. She antagonizes poor Takayama constantly about not being tough and aggressive like her (but she slowly becomes attached to him). The second girl is totally in love with Takayama because of a childhood incident when he rescued her (although he doesn't remember her or the incident). The other character is a physical giant and has an appetite to match. The group goes through training and is assigned to a security team (although Takayama yearns to be an engineer).

The episodes are clever written and you can actually get a mini-education about railroad operations in the process. Dialog is sharp and often funny. The girls in the episodes provide some fan service, but each of the 5-6 individual's characters becomes well-developed as the series progresses. Always thought this series was underrated, but it seems to have momentum the past couple of years and probably deserves a
sequel. The animation is excellent and I would rate it in my Top Ten favorite animes.",1444780800,3,1482,4.896414342629482

8731122,5,B014KEP8M6,"Naoto Takayama is a shy, nerdy, (and by iron bound anime tradition, incredible babe magnet of a) railfan who dreams of becoming a train engineer and thus joins the Japanese National Railways' on the job training program for high school students.  However, due to circumstances beyond his control, he gets railroaded into the security training program instead where he has to cope with a stereotypical (but entertainingly so) group of oddball colleagues: the muscle headed jock who thinks only of physical exertion and the eating required to sustain it (Sho Iwaizumi) and a couple of girls who are both interested in him: the tsundere, tough as nails, would-be Officer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tackleberry/dp/B00F40UBM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tackleberry</a>&nbsp;(Aoi Sakurai) and the sweet natured genius (Haruka Koumi) that along with indulgent-to-a-fault Team Leader Nana Iida, make up the hardest working security squad in the history of rail travel.  In the greatest crime wave in JNR history, Security Team K4 must cope with catching purse snatchers, defusing a bomb, solving a kidnapping, protecting a singer from a murderous stalker, chasing another bomber, preventing a train wreck, and foiling museum burglars,...

and that's just in the first six episodes!

The action heats up in the second half of the series in which our heroes must deliver an organ needed for transplant using an obsolete railcar racing down dangerous, no longer used track before the machinery completely comes to pieces or they finally fly off the rails, foil multiple attacks on a visiting railfan royal, and, of course, deal with a runaway train.  The final episode in which our hero uses his own and his friends' knowledge to keep an older train set rolling towards Tokyo despite a series of malfunctions almost counts as a problem free day for them.  The series is filled with accurately and lovingly depicted trains from steam engines to bullet trains and enough action to keep adrenaline junkies happy, though it might have railway marketing departments wincing, ""Next time, take the train... and almost die!""

Note: There's a little bit of uncensored, bare breasted fan service for those who care, mostly of the bathing or opening a door without knocking variety.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.",1465776000,,2390,5.440540540540541

Rail Wars anime is an enjoyable series about four kids trying to get work for Japan's national railway service.
These publishers(sentai) do this frequently baiting you to buy their low quality DVD then 2 months later release
HD version 2 months later do not fall for it like I did",1452816000,,363,4.417910447761194
