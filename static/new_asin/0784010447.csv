174325,2,0784010447,It was something to do. A decent time waster to help with the insomnia. Typical Lifetime grade B and nothing more.,1402963200,,114,4.476190476190476
174326,1,0784010447,"Nothing to recommend this film. Bad script, directing, acting, cinematography... did I see it had 4 stars? I give it 1.",1402876800,,119,4.714285714285714
174327,4,0784010447,"A great feature of Amazon Prime is access to free movies, many of them oldies but goodies.  Those of us who were around in Lifetime's early days remember their two-hour afternoon movie -- often similar themes, but beautiful sets, good acting, and real dialogue, without an intrusive and neverending soundtrack.  This is one of them, from 1997.

William R. Moses appears here as the male lead and always delivers.  Lysette Anthony did a few of Lifetime's earlier movies and is also very good -- her British accent adds to her charm.  We can pretty much guess the storyline and ending, but the movie has interesting twists and diversions.

Worth an evening watch.",1397088000,4,661,4.857142857142857

174329,1,0784010447,"This is what they call a ""B movie."" The stalker was cute, but I kicked myself for paying for this movie.  It's supposed to be suspenseful, but instead it was almost comical (which would have been ok if it was comical). It was derivative of every so-called stalker movie. Like a 5th clone I should say.",1393286400,2,301,4.375
174330,4,0784010447,"Antique dealer Faith Moore (Lysette Anthony) suspects that her husband Richard is having an affair. All-too-conveeeeniently, a man named Walter appears at the antique shop, ready to lend an all-too-understanding ear. Soon, Faith is in the sack w/ this all-too-empathetic Romeo. Guilt-ridden, Faith flees back home in order to wallow in her agony. Oh joy! Faith finds out that she was wrong about Richard! Yay! Now, they can live a life of domestic bliss! What the... ? Oh yeah, what about Walter? Well, it turns out that lover-boy just happens to have a few problems, including the fact that he's a relentless, homicidal psychopath! He starts out right away by stalking Faith and bumping off a nosey neighbor. Next, Faith's best friend gets a little too snoopy. I think you can see where this is going! Can Faith unload this maniac before she and those around her wind up dead? THE FIANCE is sort of FATAL ATTRACTION w/ the roles reversed. The moral of the story? Never trust a man who actually likes to go antiquing...",1391817600,10,1019,4.795454545454546

174347,3,0784010447,Not a bad Lifetime movie.  Held my interest!  Not crazy about the female lead that reminds me of Rebecca DeMornay.  But I like William Moses.  Too bad he was the villian.,1425081600,,170,4.387096774193548

174350,3,0784010447,the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 is because I was able to sit through the whole movie - didn't have to turn it off during the movie because it was That terrible.,1411171200,,183,3.8421052631578947
174351,2,0784010447,"Bad title. And not a sleazy as these movies usually are. And that is a bad thing.  Housewife thinks her husband is fooling around and takes the jump with some guy she just met at the store she works. Well he turns out to be stalker with a criminal past.  The whole twist of the movie happened within the first half  hour.  The rest is just watching her watching him.  the clueless hubby rents a house across the street. I would of said something , but no. People she knows are killed still no trip to the cops. Not a very entertaining movie.",1408233600,3,541,4.213592233009709
174352,4,0784010447,"This story relates how a wife, convinced that her husband was betraying her, decides to have a quick fling with a sympathetic admirer. This was a glaring error of judgement on her part as he was a psychopath and a danger to her and her family.

A good movie .",1403740800,,259,4.18

7795024,1,0784010447,"This definitely felt like a made for TV movie. The acting was over the top, exaggerated and I think I've seen movies from the 1950s with better special effects (when a character got stabbed the blood was really fake and he didn't even look like he was in pain).",1483401600,,261,4.346938775510204
7795025,4,0784010447,Pretty good for Lifetime (I think it must be a Lifetime movie).  Good acting and twisty plot as I remember.,1482537600,,107,4.35

7795028,1,0784010447,"The woman playing the wife is godawful. That dumb pout and overwraught acting, ugggh. There's one scene near the beginning when she looks at her husband's empty chair and sighs. That scene might be the worst overacted moment I've seen in a while. It really was comical, as someone said earlier about this film.  And the direction is so so so bad. Incredible use of filler and empty time, way too much lingering on the face of this terrible actor, cheesy music. The other actors in the film are at least watchable and the story, while predictable, is ok. But OMG the heroine. I actually have been wondering why these Lifetime movies are so uniformly bad. I avoid them for years and then some story sounds promising and I watch and start fast forwarding after about 5 mins. I made it through about half an hour and then fast forwarded my way through to the end to get the story. All the money they spend on lavish interiors and location shooting...couldn't they cut back on that and hire better directors and actors? And stop telling the stories in such a hamhanded way? I think they just don't trust the intelligence of their viewers.",1475712000,3,1133,4.58128078817734
