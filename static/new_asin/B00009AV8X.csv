Almost immediately, I figured out why the movie received an R rating--every other word was a four-letter one. The acting was mediocre at best--but the real problem was the lack of any plot!

The entire movie centered around a group of young idiots who were supposedly in college. All they did was play basketball, drink beer, curse a lot and try (but never succeed) to be funny. It was SO bad, after about 20 minutes of disgusting, yet vapid and nonsensical dialogue, we had to turn it off.

Any high school student taking a film class would have been lucky to get a D- if they handed in this piece of $*>#  as their class project!---STAY AWAY!!",1179532800,,737,4.526315789473684
