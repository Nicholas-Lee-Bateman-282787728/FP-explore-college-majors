3971471,1,B002R672II,"A bad overall movie, for several reasons.

1. Continuity mistakes. These zombies are more akin to Romero zombies that run than ones from the first three films. The compound is also misnamed.

2. The dubbing is rough, as the film was made in Romania with a majority romanian cast. This is done for cost reasons and can work out, but it gives the movie a goofy quality to it.

3. Pretty much everybody from the last film is in this one, from necropolis so nobody died.

4. Did I mention that the film is connected to the other films through name only?

5. You can tell this was something of a money grab on a known franchise name.",1417219200,2,628,4.288135593220339
3971472,3,B002R672II,"At first, I was disappointed in this film because the acting, the style, and the sheer ridiculousness of it screamed 1980s even though it was made in 2007. Only the picture quality itself seemed almost up to par for the time. But then I looked at the info on the movie and realized it was made in Romania and probably on a low budget, and by an independent film company. So I actually applaud their efforts. Hopefully future films they work on will have more developed actors, and better concepts. Still, for what it's worth, it wasn't terrible. I have seen worse.",1374624000,3,564,4.53921568627451

3971474,5,B002R672II,"AWESOME BOXSET! This set contains ""Return Of The Living Dead 4: Necropolis"" & ""Return Of The Living Dead 5: Rave To The Grave"" I was really excited about this coming to DVD since it had been years since part 3 was released prior to this one. I purchased the Canadian UNRATED boxset and love it. Got it at a great deal for $11.00. It will have more gore than both the seperate U.S. versions because those are the crappy rated R ones. Get this version of the two films if you can find this boxset still.",1312502400,,501,4.229166666666667

This is a good, ""bad"", zimbie, comedy movie.  It has everything, in just the right amounts.

This is what a Cheech & Chong zombie movie would be like - minus the band, and if they were 60 yrs younger.
Is this move something you want to buy? Probably not. Definitely worth a rental or Prime.
Will you be smarter after watching it? Nope, but it is good fun.

8378378,1,B002R672II,This was the worst dumpster fire of a film I've ever seen -- and this is coming from someone who likes B-movies.,1494201600,,112,4.136363636363637
8378379,1,B002R672II,"This is, by far, the worst movie I have ever attempted to watch, and I have seen some pretty bad movies.  The storyline is inconsistent and missing huge parts that would make most of their ""lines"" make sense at all, as is a great deal of the things they say in the film make no sense whatsoever with what is going on or has happened.  The acting is typical budget acting, no disappointment there.  Suspended disbelief just isn't enough for this atrocity, you really need to be in a dream world for this piece-meal work to begin to make sense, and it would still just be hopeful there.  Have you ever seen a class project, where everyone in the class wrote their own tiny piece of a story, and threw it all into a book?  That is what this is like;  In ten minutes, the same dude, referring to the same thing, states ""We need to find out what it is, lets take it to the chemist""  ""I told you we should have called the police"" and ""All I wanted to do was write a front page story on this stuff"", none of the latter two having ANYTHING to do with what has happened, anything that has been said, or has been part of the story.  Also, how many times DO you pay a drug manufacturer for the same batch of drugs?  You pay them for the drugs, then again later you give them ""their cut""?  Why do you take an ENTIRE BARREL of something to a lab to test a vial full of it?  I could keep going on pointing out the bull crap in this movie, and how someone with ADD would be asking ""can you keep some kind of consistency here?"", and I was only about 25 minutes in when I stopped watching.  Basically, this is absolutely terrible, and I must suggest that NOBODY waste their time watching this.  Instead, pick 25 pieces of different movies, watch them all in random order, and you will have the same consistency of story-line, and it would probably be more enjoyable.  Hell, tell three children to tell you a story together, that would probably be a better comparison.",1493164800,,1950,4.263586956521739

8378381,5,B002R672II,"Oh yes, they did that!  The Romanians did a great job with an American classic.  For the low star raters - you know who you are - please watch the whole line-up of the Return of the Living Dead movies before judging this one harshly.  Know what you are getting into before you watch it then decide to tear it up in your review.  We know it has bad humor.  We know it has bad special effects.  We know it has plot holes.  We know it is unrealistic.  We know, we know, we know, and that's why we (fans) LOVE it!  This is meant to be a comedy horror flick with bad jokes, gratuitous nudity, needless gore, and did I mention bad jokes?  I am very glad the writers, producers, and director stuck with the original concept, too.  A bunch of fringe college aged kids are out partying, drinking, doing drugs, and dancing to the wild party music of the day and engaging in stereotypical debauchery that old people always accuse teens or young adults of no matter what generation you're from.  Someone finds the long lost drum of zombie juice and screws around with it and the next thing you know, someone's yelling, ""Shoot him in the head!""  It was so good to see Tarman is still doing well and has his head back on straight.",1492128000,,1216,4.3039647577092515
8378382,3,B002R672II,"Let's be honest the acting is not the best. Then again it's a zombie movie and not depose to be Masterpiece Theather. A part drug called ""Z"" is created, but it's delivering more than just a high. Yeah it's zombies out for brains. Yes there are still canisters of trioxyin-5 around.",1491609600,,281,4.529411764705882
8378383,4,B002R672II,"Perhaps it was not a 5 STAR FILM, but I've seen the movie multiple times-->I LIKED IT!!! It was a comedy horror flick.
{example} For instance, your a high school jock or geek teen zombie with a pyramid of hot cheerleaders in front of you. Of course you are going for the butt first than the brain...she was a hottie...you wanted a piece of azzzz  (I'm blushing) hehehe  Basically, this was not a GORE film.
I'm part of the 80's BRAT-PACK era ""Class of 1985"". From the late seventies thru the early nineties, we {age range: mid-teens-->early 20's} made the moshing pits, outrageous mega ""everything goes"" raves, underground clubs, and clubbing a fashionable hierarchy statement {ie CLUB KIDS}. We also had amazingly talented people associated with the HORROR--SYFI--MONSTER--THRILLER--HORROR COMEDY--OCCULT--GORE--CULT genre's. You put those two ingredients together and this is their BRAINchild.
The director was Ellory Elkayem who also directed Eight Legged Freaks, They Nest, and Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis. I appreciate and applaud his visionary work. BRAVO!",1481500800,3,1072,5.337278106508876
