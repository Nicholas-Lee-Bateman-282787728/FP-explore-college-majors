293043,5,6300271102,"The film's plot is good, with Peter Cushing as a London antiques shop keeper, whose shop is theived by customers. These customers are killed by the items they stole. David Warner cheats Cushing to get a mirror for a  lower price, but is himself killed by a ghost demon living the mirror after  the demon has forced Warner to kill women for him. Ian Bannen steals a war  medal from Cushing's shop, and later meets a witch and her war crippled  father (Angela and real-life father Donald Pleasance) who kill him in  answer to Bannen's son's prayers. Ian Carmichael puts a lower price on a  snuff box, cheating Cushing of the real price, but is himself killed when a  demon from the box possesses his wife (Nyree Dawn-Porter) to kill him. Only  Ian Ogilvy gives Cushing the real price for an old door, and while Cushing  counts the money, a demon from the Blue Room (created when the door is put  up in Ogilvy's room) attacks both him and his wife (Lesley Anne-Down).  Also, a robber tries to steal money from Cushing's shop, but is killed in a  box of spikes. This film is one of 6 made by Amicus, each film having short  stories within them. The other films are Dr Terror's House of Horrors,  Tales From the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, The House That Dripped Blood,  and Asylum.",961113600,74,1277,4.467532467532467

293102,4,6300271102,"Imagine four episodes of a cross between Tales From The Darkside, Creepshow, Friday The 13th The Series and Night Gallery. That's about how these four shorts came across to me. Peter Cushing is an entity with a front: an antiques store like in Friday The 13th The Series and either his antiques are all cursed or he is able to curse them on behalf of the people who take possession of them. He is not human, as is revealed at the end of the movie. People come to his shop and he watches them in stealth for some purpose, either when they come in or as they are examining objects. He eventually greets them and does business. Some people try to rip him off, one flat out steals something, and they all incur paranormal curses which are quite scary and kill them all. One customer does not try to cheat the store owner and although his object is also cursed, he ultimately survives, though he destroys the item he purchased and only narrowly survives. Pretty good stories and special effects, Amicus did a fine job on this one. David Warner played the most vicious role, of course, as he always does, although he is the first curse victim.",1437782400,6,1137,4.471153846153846

293130,1,6300271102,"I rarely, if ever, rate a movie ""1 Star"".  This ""fantasy, horror"" film is sooooooooo very very bad, just nasty bad, that I have to say I really don't get the people who rated this over one star.  There was no suspense, it was nothing like ""Tales From the Crypt"" or ""Creepshow"" or any other anthology of the kind.  The only horror was the fact that I actually watched the entire thing.  I kept saying to myself, it can't really maintain this level of unwatchable mediocrity for an hour and 39 minutes, no one could attach their name to something this totally awful, but they could and did.  It appears to recycle the same actors for each story, none of whom appear to have taken any sort of acting lesson.  They stumble through the dialogue as if it's their first run-through rehearsal and they don't have their cues and marks down yet.  The ""host"" is so Wonder Bread (sorry, Wonder Bread) he's about as menacing as my great aunt Birdie in her flowered housecoat.  This caliber of film making makes Ed Wood, Jr. movies look like Orson Welles directed and wrote them.  Don't go here, just don't do it.",1418688000,,1099,4.482412060301508

293163,5,6300271102,"""From Beyond the Grave"" (1973) is one of the better Amicus productions. It stars Peter Cushing as the owner of an antiques' store, Temptations Ltd, who sells relics that may be more than the potential buyer can handle. The movie is actually an anthology of four stories - the first stars David Warner as a customer who purchases an antique mirror from Cushing's character, and he delights in the fact that he got it at a 'bargain', effectively cheating the antiques' store owner of a profit. But, Warner's character soon learns that he got more than he expected when a seance unleashes an evil entity that demands a high price. In the second story, a henpecked husband strikes up an awkward friendship with a retired army officer [played by Donald Pleasence]. The husband steals a medal from Cushing's store, and later finds himself getting tangled up with Pleasance's character and his rather strange, otherworldly daughter, Emily. In the third story, a well-to-do man cheats Cushing by switching the price tags on a snuff box, and on his way home, finds himself confronted by a psychic, Mdm Orloff, who warns him that he is being haunted by an elemental, a parasitic spirit that sucks the very life force out of its victim. In the final story, Ian Ogilvy [who was also in another Amicus chiller] plays a man who purchases an ancient door from Cushing's store, and places it in his house, discovering to his horror that the door is a portal to a place that houses an evil spirit. Time slowly runs out for him and his wife [played by a very young Lesley Anne Down] as they try to escape a gruesome death.

The acting is top-notch for this genre, and Cushing impresses as always. Fans of atmospheric supernatural tales will love these four stories. A must-have for fans of the genre.",1368489600,,1782,4.693290734824281

293165,4,6300271102,"Prepare yourself for more twisted tales of the supernatural in FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE, another chilling omnibus feature from the makers of THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD and TALES FROM THE CRYPT! Peter Cushing stars as an unassuming antiques dealer whose wares each carry with them a horrible curse. ""The Gate Crasher"" involves a bloodthirsty spirit that commands its new owner to kill so that it may regain new life. An unhappily married man finds new love in a street beggar's daughter, only to find that she carries a dark secret of her own in ""An Act of Kindness."" Ian Carmichael plays the unfortunate sap who is haunted by a mischievous demon known as ""The Elemental."" We end with ""The Door,"" where a writer must fight off the malevolent spirit that lives behind his newly-installed doorway... to hell! FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE holds up to the high standards put forth by Amicus in their earlier releases, with devlish performances by the entire cast. Among them, David Warner provides one of his darkest roles as Edward in ""The Gate Crasher,"" and Margaret Leighton is wonderfully kooky in ""The Elemental."" Donald Pleasence and daughter Angela are also delightfully devious in ""An Act of Kindness."" The wraparound story featuring Peter Cushing ties things up neatly, and allows the hinted moral consequence needed for each ironic ending. The creepy atmosphere hits its peak in the final tale, when William encounters the vampirish ghost within his deathly tomb. With modest special effects and keen writing to match, FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE trails just shortly behind Amicus' other winning pictures.

293166,5,6300271102,"From Amicus Productions, ""From Beyond the Grave"" is a worthwhile gem of horror and macabre. like ""Tales from the Crypt"", and ""Vault of Horror"" this movie is a series of vignettes all linked together by an antique shop that has something for everyone. Peter Cushing plays the proprietor of the shop who always seems to have a knowing grin about him; he knows something the customer doesn't know and is delighting in it. Each of the short stories is wholly independent and stands alone as well acted and interesting snips.
The DVD quality is very good but is lacking any special features which is disappointing.

293167,2,6300271102,Movie was ok yet I expected something different in terms of Peter Cushing's role.  The various nuossiances were somewhat disappointing.,1353196800,,135,5.75
293168,3,6300271102,"In the 1970s Amicus Pictures put together the last of their English horror anthology films with Peter Cushing playing the narrator of sorts.  He runs a shop of strange objects that people wander into and buy.

Except the boys that wander into this shop cheat Peter's character and pay the price!

The film breaks down into four parts and each part has its moments.  My favorite was the door that a writer buys and uses this fancy door to cover over his supplies closet!  Duh!  However when he opens it late at night, a room to another universe opens.  It's some creepy guy who dresses so 17th century and wants our hero and his girl to spend eternity.

If the room is supposed to trap people, why was our hero so easily able to run out whenever he wanted to?  And what was with wrestling with this 300 year old guy and not being able to give him a good old-fashioned punch?

Another fav is the family man who cheats on his wife but gets the tables turned on him by a strange couple.  Donald Pleasance (Fantastic Voyage, Outer Limits) stars.

I won't review each tale.  But I will say that despite the horrible effects, the stories ran pretty quickly and the film does capture your interest.

The episodes in order are:

The Gatecrasher -
An Act of Kindness
The Elemental
The Door -

293183,4,6300271102,"I first saw From Beyond the Grave in 1975 (at Co-Op City Cinema) when it played in the Bronx.  I saw it with my then bride to be and an old friend who was also a seasoned horror film buff. Naturally, we enjoyed this Amicus film and my future wife thought we were both crazy. Actually, this film was a cut above other Amicus productions since it featured Peter Cushing as the owner of the curio shop (Temptations) and the common link between the tales.  The first story was pretty weak, but the next two were really fine. This DVD is a good buy for any fans of Amicus films.

Briefly, Peter Cushing, who plays the owner of Temptations wants to tempt you with some curio in his shop. If you secumb he provides a ""surprise gift with every purchase"".  Customers who switch pricing labels, shoplift or some other similar act are dispatched with their special surprise ending.",1249862400,10,870,4.487341772151899
293184,5,6300271102,"I've always loved horror anthologies, and Amicus produced some true classics (Tales from the Crypt & Asylum are also personal favorites of mine).  This one is a fore-runner to TV shows like ""Friday the 13th-The Series"" and Stephen King's novel Needful Things (which, incidentally, was also clearly inspired by Richard Matheson's short story ""The Distributor"").

The film revolves around Temptations Ltd., a London antique shop run by a mysterious proprietor (Peter Cushing) whose motto is ""Offers You Cannot Resist.""  The shop provides the wrap-around story for the other 4 tales, each involving a different customer.

Each story involves some element of the supernatural, but unlike ""Friday the 13th-The Series"" or King's Needful Things, the supernatural aspect is not always linked directly to the item purchased from the antique shop.  In 2 of the stories, the customer encounters the supernatural (albeit unknowingly) even before he sets foot inside Temptations, Ltd.  In the other 2 stories, the item purchased from the shop is tied directly to the supernatural, as the item is ""haunted"" or ""cursed"" of some malevolent being or spirit.

However, the OUTCOME of each story is very much related to the manner in which the customers deal with the shop's proprietor.  Cheat the proprietor, steal from him, or attempt to deceive him, and your future becomes very grim, for as Cushing laments in the final scene, ""The love of money truly is the root of all evil.""

Very highly recommended for classic horror film enthusiasts.",1248048000,6,1524,5.187755102040816
293185,4,6300271102,"During the mid-sixties to mid-seventies, Amicus Productions was most famous for its horror anthologies.  ""From Beyond the Grave"" is a classic example.  Before there was Lewis Vendredi's Curious Goods (""Friday the 13th the Series""), there was Temptations Ltd - an antique store whose owner is wonderfully played by horror legend Peter Cushing.  He sells cursed antiques to unscrupulous customers who experience grisly deaths.  These antiques include a mirror, a medal, a snuff box and a door.

  The first tale, ""The Gate Crasher,"" is my favorite.  It is a genuine slasher flick.  A young man (David Warner of ""The Omen"") lures strangers to his apartment and stabs them to death in order to free the medieval wizard that is trapped inside a mirror.

  The second tale, ""An Act of Kindness,"" is a rather bizarre one rife with dark humor.  It stars Donald Pleasance (""Halloween"" and ""Phenomena"") as a street peddler; he befriends an underappreciated businessman who has just stolen a war medal.  The peddler's strange daughter uses voodoo to free the businessman of those who oppress him.

  The third tale, ""The Elemental,"" involves a man who buys a snuff box.  Soon an unseen demon is hitting, scratching and choking his wife.  A medium is called to exorcise this demon.  This diabolical tale of possession is also rife with dark humor.

  The last (and my second favorite) tale, ""The Door,"" involves a mysterious blue room that appears and disappears at will whenever someone opens an ornately carved door.  Occupying the room is a Medieval gentleman who demands sacrifices in order to continue surviving.  This story reminded me much of my beloved gothic soap opera ""Dark Shadows;"" in one storyline, a closet door opens into a nursery from the past that appears and disappears.

  All four tales, based on stories written by R. Chetwynd Hayes of ""The Monster Club,"" involve people who want to be free.  However, the price is a costly one.  They should never have given into the temptation of cheating the aging owner of the antique store.  Only one customer escapes unharmed - the one who honestly paid the agreed upon price.

  Warner Brothers Twisted Terror Collection has done a superb job of restoring ""From Beyond the Grave.""  It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1; the audio and video are pristine - without flaws.  There are English subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.  However, the only extra is a theatrical trailer that is in full frame and in need of restoration.

  ""From Beyond the Grave"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy Amicus horror anthologies.  All others should rent before purchasing.  Other Amicus anthologies that I have enjoyed are: ""Torture Garden,"" ""Asylum,"" ""The House that Dripped Blood,"" ""Tales from the Crypt,"" ""Vault of Horror,"" ""Tales that Witness Madness"" and ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.""

The first time you watch it, you might not be impressed, but the more you view it the better it gets.  The director did a good job of making the short films interesting and entertaining, with a little gore added, that does not detract from the films.

293193,4,6300271102,"A startling cast of eerie British eccentrics gathered together on one delirious slice of quaint gothic.
A solid roll-call of weirdness conspiring to chill and thrill in a darkly humorous, deadly shiver-some collection of short stories by R. Chetwynd Hayes; transferred to the screen by the excellent Amicus Productions.

'FBTG' is a portmanteau movie (ie. it's divided into segments); a cinema sub-genre whose horror strain began in the UK with the (still) scary
'Dead of Night' in 1945.

Peter Cushing (with an extra-ordinary accent; faintly Yorkshire but anyone's guess..) plays the laconic owner of Temptations Ltd: a side-street antique shop into which a desperate array of cheats and criminals venture for a 'deal', but each deservedly ends up on the losing end of their particular terrible transaction.
Each customer is as tricky as they come as they try to rip old Cushing off, but each finds adjusting his price brings a greater price of its own.

The opening gory story sees the brilliantly sinister David Warner conning old Peter into selling him a mirror for a tenth its worth and finding out far too late it wasn't the wisest course of action he's ever taken. Something nasty and demanding lives in the mirror, and it needs blood to facilitate its transmutation to the real world.
Warner is excellent as a Poe-type figure descending into madness Trapped in his corpse-strewn apartment, compelled to spill blood for the thing in the mirror.
'Alice Through the Looking Glass' this tale certainly ain't.

Twitchy Ian Bannen's in the next story( remember him in the Peter Collinson/babysitter-in-peril thriller - 'Fright'?), playing a hen-pecked office clerk who invents himself an elaborate fantasy military history to impress a street shoelace salesman(!), a sly and understated Donald Pleasence.
Stealing a DSO medal from Temptations Ltd, he then finds himself embroiled with Pleasence and his spooky, wiccan offspring (played by real-life daughter Angela).
As his own home life is wretched, he finds the lavish food and unconditional respect he enjoys at the Pleasence's much more to his liking.
His seduction by Pleasence's alarming daughter is incredible: ""I wish to serve you. I will do anything you ask, you only have to order....."" she whispers - oblivious to decades of suffrage and bra-burning - and naturally he can't resist.
Needless to say it all ends badly, with a great twist (you WON'T see it coming); all seemingly overseen by a tut-tutting Cushing in his dusty emporium.

Poor old Ian Carmichael is the next to fall to Temptation; naughtily switching the price on a snuff box and finding himself with an evil spirit eating into his shoulder.
Engaging the services of a batty medium who trashes his house ousting the creature (known as an elemental) it seems all is well, but it's only the beginning....
This is my favourite episode. Funny and scary in all the right places, with some lightning witty lines and acted to perfection by Ealing favourite Carmichael; Nyree Dawn Porter - superb as his increasingly terrified wife; and Margaret Leighton - delightfully dotty as the avaricious exorcist.
A magical segment even in such elevated company.

The final story is probably the weakest but is still good. Ian Ogilvy ("" you took him from me, YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME...!!!"") 'purchases' a door which of course, has a deSade type occultist and sadist inhabiting the 'Blue Room' beyond it.
This story also has a decent little hook, and has the desperately sexy Lesley Ann Down in horrific peril as a redeeming perk.

The film finishes with a rather clumsy culmination of the framing story, with a robber who's been constantly disturbed by the various 'clients', finally having a violent crack at poor old 'defenceless' Peter.
Unwise.

'FBTG' is ace. Atmospheric, enthusiastically directed, constantly amusing while at the same time delivering delicious old-fashioned chills.
It has a surprising amount of gore - for those of you interested in that type of thing - and Cushing, mad accent and all, hold's the whole thing together with a wicked twinkle.

So horror, humour and hantiques (I am REALLY sorry!); 'FBTG' may not be a horror Rembrandt but it's certainly an esteemed and worthwhile objet d'art.",1212192000,4,4222,5.072046109510087
293194,4,6300271102,"This is a great movie for those who love the short stories of horror. As always, Peter Cushing makes a great proprietor of a most interesting, out of the way shop that sells all types of ""items"" with colorful histories.

Fact is, it's regarded as one of the finer collection of stories to be produced by the British film industry.

And the packaging, quality, marketing  and distribution by Amazon is also pretty amazing.  Keep it up. Hey, I've been wanting to find it on DVD for years.

Each story has its merits but the one that stayed with me was the second. Donald Pleasance's daughter is amazing as the grim seductress - ""Do you want me to?

Our friend, Peter Cushing is actually the Devil in disguise and the film features five stories that center around purchases made by characters in an antique shop. All but one of the purchasers try to ""beat the devil"" and well, you can guess what the results are. I will cut to the chase and speak only of the best story that concerns the only honest customer and his purchase of an antique door. Once mounted, it becomes a doorway to the past and is actually a trap by the former owner to collect souls as part of his black magic rituals. This story has visual power and is truly errie. The passage can be seen by the viewer as ""active"" when the door shines a bluish haze around the central design of the door. It also seems to be able to unlatch itself, and acts like a mousetrap, snapping shut the moment the proper (in this case, female) soul enters from the other side.
