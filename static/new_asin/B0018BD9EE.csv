8269107,5,B0018BD9EE,"I know many people disagree with his methods, but I truly believe in him. He just makes sense. As a certified dog trainer, I use his methods quite frequently. One big thing I learned from him is this:  from the minute a puppy is born, it has structure in its young life from its mother & from its litter mates. Once in the hands of humans, that structure is gone because people want their dogs to ""just be a dog"". Guess what?  For a dog to be a dog, that means it needs structure - taught what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. That's what it's mother/litter mates teach it from day one. Cesar teaches us how to provide that structure. Oh - and if you think the lessons stop at an early age, guess again. It's a non-stop process throughout the dogs life. That's if you want a well behaved dog and a good relationship with that wonderful animal. Cesar teaches all this. It's a DVD every dog owner should purchase.",1358640000,3,917,4.325581395348837

8269113,3,B0018BD9EE,"I am a true Cesar Millan fan, but this video is simply a few episodes taken from his series.  The title lead me to believe that the ""stories of hope and inspiration"" would be stories not included in the television series, something extra.  I felt as though I was tricked.",1219622400,14,271,4.4
