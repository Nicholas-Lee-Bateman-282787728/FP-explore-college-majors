2969524,5,B000WGZGNS,"I am a huge Beyonce fan so I may be a little biased, but she really did her thing on this tour. I love how she has an all female band and women of all shapes and sizes dancing with and behind her and singing as well. She takes our old favorites and spices them up with mixes of current songs and dances. (My favorites would have to be the ""Crank That"" Soldier Mix...Beyonce does what she does best...and the other would have to be the new version of Baby Boy with the extended reggae mix). She finally performed Flaws and All and I love how the camera is on her and she connects with her fans. The entire set, theme, and flow of the show was great. I am still questioning some of her choice in set outfits, (like the sequins on the swimsuit...?) But overall it was an incredible experience, and I wish I was there to witness her in action-her stage presence and the way she interacts with her fans is incredible. There is no other performer like her right now who can sing, dance, and truly give you your money's worth of an entertaining show.

The flip side...is Kelly and Michelle came out for a chorus of Survivor-which was hilarious to me because she had just finished an ENTIRE set of Destiny's Child songs by herself! Just watching Bee perform only reflects the superstar that she is and she is deserving of that title-I think Kelly and Michelle are nice, but they are mediocre they are not on Bee's level and its not because her dad put her in the spotlight SHE works her butt off and is smart and when you watch this DVD of her concert you will agree. She goes out on the stage and leaves her blood, sweet, and tears with the audience and you can fill that passion...that always makes for an incredible artist. This DVD is worth the money whether you are a Beyonce fan or not.",1195516800,9,1784,4.293768545994065
2969525,5,B000WGZGNS,"I was at the Lake Tahoe show just two weeks before this DVD was filmed and I must say BEYONCE is one of the Greatest entertainers AND she IS hands down the most BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in the entire world. The Lake Tahoe show was GREAT and usually I can't swallow LIVE DVD's in just ONE sitting, but THIS ONE...I could, in fact THIS IS the perfect souviner if you went to one of her shows this past summer. Whatever I did miss when I saw her live due to TALL people in the way obstructing my view, I was finally able to see it on this. I give this 5 stars, the energy, the performance is GREAT and I recommend this to ALL, the ONLY thing that would have made it better was if Kelly and Michelle would have been out there for the Destiny's Child medley, rather than just at the end of SURVIVOR, I STILL hope that they RE-UNITE one day in the future. My favorite Highlights of the DVD for me is when she does BEAUTIFUL LIAR...which I personally thought was GREAT (But NOT long enough)and the closing number ""IRREPLACEABLE"" with the crowd singing the entire first verse, I got a case of goosebumps when we did that in Tahoe, it was the same feeling watching it happen on DVD...GET THIS!!!! It's GREAT!!!!",1195516800,6,1193,4.283185840707965
2969526,3,B000WGZGNS,"This concert was okay, but I think her Beyonce - Live at Wembley (DVD with Bonus CD) was a lot better.  But even better is Destiny's Child farewell concert DVD.  If you want to see her and her girls at their best, get that one.

She didn't seem to give the same energy we've seen her give before.  It's like she was holding back so she wouldn't tire herself out through out the concert and it seems like her back up singers did most of the singing. Maybe because she looks a little more out of shape than she did in her previous concerts.

Also, the video is streched to make her look thinner (like Paula Abdul's Promise of a New Day Music Video).  It kind of disturbs the eyes after awhile and makes you think you got a bad copy.

Beyonce is a great artist, one of the best of her time, but this DVD did not deliver what I hoped it would.",1195516800,9,839,4.079268292682927
2969527,5,B000WGZGNS,"I saw Beyonce' in concert this summer and, was fortunate enough to be close enough to the stage to see the sweat on her face..lol..She's even more beautiful in person than she is in the Magazines...Her performances were flawless and she never missed a note!...I'm looking forward to seeing this DVD!!!...",1195430400,3,304,4.980392156862745
2969528,5,B000WGZGNS,"I went to see Beyonce this past summer in Nashville & I was blown away. I am a die hard Beyonce' fan, I love her CD's and I really like her. She seems like she would be a really sweet person. She is definitly a TOP GRADE artist, no lip synching!!!! she danced, sang & DANCED her behind all over that stage. I can not wait to get my hands on this DVD! Beyonce' continues to impress me, I can not wait til her next music CD hits the scence.",1195344000,3,438,3.8777777777777778
2969529,3,B000WGZGNS,"The Beyonce' Experience was Beyonce' Knowles's first headlining tour as a solo artist and lives up to everything you can expect it to be, based on what you're usually used to seeing from her.  Very glamourous, very flirty, very seductive, and over the top at times, Beyonce' pulled out all the stops on this outing as she breezed through her huge catalogue of hits in a 2-hour set that garnered nothing but positive reviews and praise when she toured the states the Summer of 2007 (sans the unfortunate pyrotechnics mishap in St. Louis and serious tumble down the stairs during ""Ring the Alarm"" in Orlando).

While clearly realizing with certain numbers that ""we've seen it all before,"" from her ""Ring the Alarm"" performance a la the 2006 MTV Music Awards to her Kylie Minogue-inspired robot opening of ""Get Me Bodied"" from the 2007 BET Awards, along with familiar recreations of the videos on her B'Day Anthology Album DVD, it's the energy and commitment Beyonce brings to the stage that sells this entire tour, next to her Southern charm and beauty.  To see it in a live setting is just something that has to be admired, as opposed to watching countless award show appearances and performances and videos in the comfort of your home.  Even watching this DVD you can only imagine the rush of seeing her perform live.  However, there was nothing fancy about the show: no elaborate sets or gaudy costumes, not a whole lot of lights and explosions.  Along with her all female band, buxom backup singers known as ""The Mamas,"" and a fierce dance troupe, next to the star herself, you tend to finish the show wishing for just a little bit more.

The set list was (which may stray slightly from the DVD release):
Crazy in Love
Freakum Dress
Green Light
Baby Boy
Beautiful Liar
Naughty Girl
Me, Myself And I
Dangerously In Love
Flaws & All
DC3 Medley
-Independent Women Part I

Check On It
Dj Vu
Get Me Bodied
Welcome to Hollywood
Dreamgirls
Listen
Irreplaceable
Happy B'Day

The performance at the Staples Center differs from other performances during the trek as Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams join her on stage for ""Survivor"" and Jay-Z during ""Upgrade U.""

Highlights:
-After stripping the floor length gown off and into a sizzling mini-dress, she steers away from the original song to sing ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley.  She also does this when she sings ""Dangerously in Love,"" quickly switching into Jill Scott's ""He Loves Me"" for the remainder of the track.
-Beyonce cried during ""Flaws and All"" at mulitple shows
-The ""Welcome to Hollywood"" swell captured some never-before-seen footage of Beyonce behind the scenes

Some ""Iffy"" Points:
-Beyonce was unable to hold her own on the songs that didn't require just her, i.e. ""Beautiful Liar,"" which seemed out of place without Shakira, and most of the Destiny's Child songs
-Some of the songs had a twist on them that really should've been left out like the Chopped & Screwed mix of ""Bug a Boo"" and the slowed up version of ""Check On It.""
-While it's realized that she wanted to give her fans all that she's offered musically, she tried to jumble way too many songs into the show, some should've clearly been omitted so that others could've been performed in their entirety
-The ""Dreamgirls"" sequence was just a little too much and could've been executed differently

While some may contend that the lack of extra effects and high ticket cost (single seats topped $200 in some cities, not to mention up to over $1000 for fan club exclusive seats and a once in a lifetime meet and greet) was not worth it, the ""experience"" was clearly the making of a music superstar who has many years ahead of her to perfect her craft to icon status.  This is a DVD must-have for any fan of Beyonce, Destiny's Child, or person who was unable to score tickets to one of the most anticipated tours of 2007.",1195344000,20,4023,4.713675213675214

2969554,5,B000WGZGNS,"I'm loving this dvd. I recently purchased it b/c I have a whole new appreciation for this lady's work ethic. It doesn't matter how many times I've seen her perform, she gives her all. I'm from an older generation w/ daughters around her age so I wasn't listening to her earlier music w/ destinys child. But I love some of her early solo offerings. I've even discovered some ""new"" music from her after watching this show. Lol.  What's truly impressive about her performance is that she can not only dance well and sing well but she can do both at the SAME time AND very very well!!",1474761600,2,580,4.420560747663552

2969560,5,B000WGZGNS,"I agree with what the other reviewers have said about the energy and professionalism of this performance. Beyonce is right on top of things throughout the show, and her band and dancers are also incredibly skilled and well-drilled. The amount of rehearsal and stage coordination that must have gone into this production is simply staggering, and it seems to come off without a hitch!  I like the way that - on this tour - Beyonce makes room to showcase her band members in a solo spot (her Japanese pianist, among others, is remarkable), and the way the musical soundscape gives nods to classic performers and influences along the way (e.g. the implied  'Love Supreme' riff behind the sax solo spot.). I also think that Beyonce is remarkably down to earth and genuine for such a huge megastar. She warmly talks to the large crowd like they are friends, and obviously loves what she is doing. Overall, this DVD captures a great modern r&b artist at the peak of her considerable powers as a stage performer.",1451174400,,1005,4.7371428571428575

2969583,5,B000WGZGNS,"Beyonce's talent and energy amaze me.  The concert is extremely entertaining and well done.

Beyonce has got to be one of the hardest working singers i have ever seen after watching this dvd!
She non-stops dances while pulling off crazy notes on the mic.
what a superstar this girl is.
her dancing in crazy in love is just ridiculous i don't even know how her body moves like that
her vocals in dangerously in love will match any female vocalist .. including christina aguilera.. who i am obsessed with so thats saying alot!
her personality and sexiness on stage is whats most entertaining.
her 'i am woman, hear me roar' attitude is so uplifting and inspiring to every person in the world.
and she is so cute in ugrade u with jay-z when he is rapping her interaction with him is adorable
GET THIS DVD!!
I HAVE WATCHED IT ATLEAST 140 TIMES!

The production quality is outstanding, with the hard work that's gone into the variety of different numbers, and Beyonce over-delivers as always in a world-class performance.  Seeing stunning clarity and energy captured on blu-ray from one of the world's top performers is a memorable experience; I've re-watched this dvd many times - it's great.

On this dvd, my favorite tracks are deja vu, get me bodied, check on it, naughty girl, baby boy, beautiful liar, and crazy in love.  Sensational work ethic and performance from everyone, B and the dancers and band did a great job delivering a high energy concert - worth watching many times.  The showmanship on this is outstanding, the energy and excitement are fun to watch, and this is a great dvd.  Thx to Beyonce and team for doing it right... nice job!

Item arrived in perfect condition, sealed in the original shrink wrap. And the concert disc plays like a charm. This is a great DVD and I would recommend that everybody watch it at some point. Beyonce puts on an incredible performance, and no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy the show. There is something for everybody. It was such a thorough production too. The music, the singing, the dancing, the acting, the musicianship, the list goes on and on. Long story short, buy it and you won't be disappointed. Seriously. Oh, oh, oh! And the one reason I bought this was for the enormous Destiny's Child medley in the middle of the concert. Spectacular. Brought me back to the glory days of Destiny's Child. Epic!",1284768000,,843,4.702702702702703
2969719,5,B000WGZGNS,"I had previously heard some of Beyonce's songs and seen a few of her videos, and I found them to be decent, though nothing really special.  But yesterday, I watched this concert DVD, and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed!

This gal has it all.  For starters, of course she's gorgeous and oozes a distinctly innocent sexiness.  Beyond this important superficiality, I was delighted to discover that she has abundant ability as an artist.  Most strikingly, I was blown away by how good a singer she is - easily in the top echelon of pop and R&B singers.  Next add that she's a great dancer (and somehow all that dancing never seemed to cause her to sweat or get out of breath!).  Finally, as a performer, she portrays her characters like a true actor, and her interaction with the audience is sincere and engaging.

As an overall package, this (long) concert coheres well, with a nice variety of great songs, ranging from heartful ballads to bumpin grooves, all sequenced to form a natural flow.  Complementing that, we get an understated but effective use of costume changes and lighting.  Last but not least, her dancers are solid and her all-female band is super tight (I especially enjoyed the two drummers).

Again, this is a great concert, and Beyonce demonstrates that she's a great artist and performer who deserves her success.  Add me to her fan club!

7/25/10 Update: I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this DVD, and it's well worth it.  The improvement in visual clarity is huge.

Truly, BeyOnCe is the greatest performer I've ever watched. I own a lot of Concert DVD and I could say that this concert experience showed what the true entertainment is. From the Opening till the end she gave her best. The stage was really conceptualized to fit on each of the song and her personality, there were no dull performance. The Light Effects on the stage made the concert so Fabulous and Amazing and I think that's what made the concert Great. Another thing she doesn't forget where she came from, From being in a Girl group (Destiny's Child) and She still sang their hit songs, even though she has her own already. Personally my favorite prod here was the Get me Bodied, the routine impressed me lot, the costumes, the routines, her sexiness and her being artistic. So the Question is ARE YOU READY TO BE ENTERTAIN ??? Well if you want, grab a copy of this from Amazon !!!",1271203200,,1075,5.3609467455621305

It seems she tried to sing every hit she ever made and I grew tired of watching and listening to her.  I think she should have left out the Destiny's Child material and the DC reunion.  She's got boundless energy and visually she is quite stunning.  The show was entertaining for the most part and her costumes were very pretty, except the one where she has the jewels on her bottom.  I guess the editing was top notch as well, because I never heard her miss a note or lose her breath.  There's one song, something about her flaws, that I really liked.  I'd never heard that one before.  The audience there for the taping experienced a real treat, but watching this 2 hour spectacle proved to be a chore for me.

Now if your impressed with a moderately attractive half naked curvy woman who shakes, struts, wiggles and flaunts her body on stage then yes you will love this DVD.

The video production in Blu-ray brings up how truly beautiful and talented she really is.  You know how good the performer is when you see a live performance.  Beyonce really delivers in this video and makes it look easy.  She dances as good or even better than her backup dancers while delivering excellent vocals. You will be able to witness the energy of her fine,live performance.

If you have a sound system the recording of the music, sounds concert like.  I have an older-tube hd TV running the video at 1080i and the video reproduction remains great.

I recommend a buy for this Blu-ray of Beyonce; you will not regret your purchase.

The video production is wonderful - very crisp and colorful on screen. The audio is top notch as well, and it's great to see a live performance throughout the concert. This is an artist that truly describes the word. She captivates the audience (and the viewer if I may say so) to sing along with and dance with her every move.

2969831,5,B000WGZGNS,"Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed. Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic. The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.

I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike others where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide the weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert video's that put you right in the experience using camera angles that allow you to actually SEE THE PERFORMANCE.

From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, ""...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,"" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts. Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier. Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.

The Blu-Ray image is presented in beautiful 1080p and a 1:78.1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case); it fills your screen completely without letterboxing. The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement. The PCM audio will drive the neighbors to call the police on you because of the explosive sound quality.  For the Blu-Ray fans who like all those fancy little extras, sorry you'll be disappointed.  The video is a direct port of the DVD version.  Even still, running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experiences any artist has ever offered.

This concert was great. Beyonce sings and dance her heart out in every number. Don't expect too many surprises though, because this DVD is basically an upgrade from her ""Beyonce - Live at Wembley"". She took the concepts of her first solo DVD and Destiny's Child farewell Atlanta DVD and upgraded the performances a level or two. That's not a bad thing, but I expected to see a little more from her.

I have only two real complaints: There is no bonus footage (behind the scenes footage, interview, or bonus track). In this day and time, you expect more from an artist and I think Beyonce short-changed us on the extra stuff. Its no wonder Christina Aguilera's DVD is doing better than Beyonce's (despite costing more).

The other complaint I have is the video is stretched. Why? To make her appear thinner? It didn't work because even though Beyonce is beautiful, you can tell she was heavier than her last tour. I just find it tacky that they tried to cover that up by stretching the video.

Either way, I enjoyed the concert and I think you will too.",1212624000,3,1318,4.572033898305085

2969867,4,B000WGZGNS,"To make things clear right off the bat--This is a ladies show made by the ladies for the ladies! All the performers, with the exception of 4 male dancers, were female, and the 4 that weren't female definitely catered to the female audience!

Now on to the Best Parts:

*This show began with a bang! Beyonce popped out of the stage floor with a glamorous gown tightly fitted over her curvaceous body. Midway into her singing, prancing, and booty bouncing through her hit ""Crazy in Love"" she snaps the tail of her dress to reveal a dress more fitting for the ""uh oh"" dance. Then she meshes in the mega hit ""CRAZY"" by Gnarls Barkley, and heads on straight to her crazy adlibs.
*For Freakum Dress Beyonce added a lil stylish soul and aggressive rock to the pop number, creating a really sexy combination!
*On Me Myself and I Beyonce sings a more soulful, smoky, and heartfelt version of her 2003 hit ""Me Myself and I"", making this my personal fave of the night.
*On Dangerously in Love Beyonce smoothly mixes in a lovely melody by Jill Scott, the Underground hit ""He Loves Me"". Although this was no comparison to Jill's booming yet more masterfully skilled vocals that i had heard just the previous summer at the Suger Water Fest, Beyonce did her thing and gave a pleasing performance.
*Another highlight was Beyonce's performance of Upgrade U, her current urban hit with hubby Jay Z, who unfortunately didn't show up at my concert, but laid down a tight verse on the DVD version.
*The Destiny's Child Medley: Smooth. Really shines even without the other DC members. Really cute performance of ""Soldier"".

However this DVD does have some downsides:

*some songs were shortened so much that they were ending just as I was getting into the groove
*Beautiful Liar (performed WITHOUT the queen of hipshaking Shakira) and Dreamgirls were really boring and have no purpose for being on the DVD.
how i regret not going to the bathroom during these time-wasting spots.
*no extra features on the DVD,
but special features usually suck anyways, and its absence doesn't really hinder the overall captivating and energetic essence of the show
*Suga Mama was a real let down for those who deemed this their fave song from Beyonce as I did. Most of this amazing song was lip-synched as Beyonce took a whiff of a cigarette and stripper-danced around a pole throughout the first and second verses of the wonderfully candy-laced song(which you really can't see from where I was at the 80th row). It wasn't until the bridge that beyonce began to sing (and believe me you can tell the difference). Although she added some crazy adlibs at the end, I just wasn't satisfied. Frankly, I was expecting the same exciting energy-filled, hormone-induced performance she gave for ""Work It Out"" in her less than stellar Dangerously in Love Tour.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert and the DVD; from its live band instrumentation to live backing singers with their powerful voices and great harmonizing skills (a grade or two up from the way beyonce's former group members, Kelly & Michelle, would just stand around and lip-synch the chorus as shown in their guest appearance during ""Survivor"").

I was certainly entertained by the sexy male dancers, the shiny, fashionable, gowns (in silver, my favorite color!), Beyonce's excellent stage presence, eye-catching choreography, as well as her energetic and estrogen filled performance. I especially enjoyed the female empowering theme present throughout the whole show! Nonetheless, men will enjoy the sexy ladies on stage, from Beyonce, to her stunning dancers, and be enraptured by the power of catchy beats combined with glitter and extensively polished yet at times soulful vocals. Despite its few let downs, it is compensated for by its many benefits and cheap price, making it a wonderful as a gift or an addition to your own DVD collection. 4.5 Stars.",1207267200,2,3882,4.901065449010654

Songs performed are ""Irreplaceable,"" ""Baby Boy,"" ""No No No Pt. 2,"" and ""Say My Name."" A historic reunion with Destiny's Child (""Survivor"") and a guest appearance by the one-and-only Jay-Z (""Upgrade U""). Over 2 hours of excitement.",1206748800,,560,4.968085106382978
2969869,5,B000WGZGNS,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. Before I bought this dvd I was not a huge fan of Beyonce's music although I found her visually very appealing & thought she was a good dancer. But this concert was amazing, Beyonce sounded beautiful: doing several acapella sections to demonstrate her control over her fabulous voice. This DVD proved one thing to me: Beyonce can really sing!

I loved the parts where she was just singing.

I also loved the dancing, OMG, the dancing was incredible and as usual all of the outfits in this show were all show-stoppers. Beyonce looked smoking hot and elegant at the same time: how does she dance in those heels?

I loved the moments where she let the members of her band play their instruments solo it shows how much individual talents she has in her band. She also did a reggae segment that I loved.

All of Beyonce's team was on point for this one, The back up singers were fabulous, the dancers were great and the all female band was rocking!

This DVD also has special appearances by Jay Z and Destiny's Child.

While watching this concert I was reminded of just how many hits Beyonce has been a part of over the past few years. She performed all her major hits from Destiny's child, Dangeroulsly in Love and B'day including music from the Dreamgirls soundtrack and ""Check On It"" from The Pink Panther movie.

Also it must be said that the stage & the lights were AMAZING.

I loved this DVD, 10 stars!",1205366400,3,1442,4.498084291187739
2969870,4,B000WGZGNS,"I've never been a Beyonce fan. I hear her music from time to time and bob my head or do a little dance, but I've never been one to purchase her music, let alone go see her perform. I never doubted her ability to entertain---let's face it, she was BORN to do this! But after hearing so many people exclaim how awesome this concert was, I just had to check it out.

I was pleasantly surprised. She keeps it moving throughout. The production is stellar. From her band, to her dancers, to her on stage, she keeps your eyes locked and glued anticipating what will happen next. One thing I loved about this is how she highlighted her musicians, allowing them their moments to display their talents while she dressed or  changed or took a break, whatever. She gave props to the big band behind her. Also, with the backup singers and the dancers, she allowed them their moment to shine---the focus, surprisingly, was taken 'away' from Beyonce for awhile. She incorporated songs from other artists into her works and revamped/remixed her songs.

Overall, it was an absolute solid production, much better I think (at least more energetic and LIVE! than her Dangerously in Love tour).

The only thing I missed from this piece was special features. The DVD offers you the ability to 'remix' the various songs, streaming them through your computer or television for 'listening' sake, but it didn't have any behind-the-scenes footage as did her first tour. I think fans would love more to be able to see Beyonce, not only in her element on stage, but behind the curtain. How does she prepare? What all is involved in this production that wasn't in the first?

She is truly an awesome performer and while I didn't think B'Day was all that great compared to her previous work and works with Destiny's Child, she manages to incorporate the best of her sophomore release intermixed with selections from DIL and Destiny's Child's catalog of work. I can only imagine what theme her next production will take on. Four stars for The Beyonce Experience! Next time, if they include special features, I'll give it five!",1203724800,,2094,4.726027397260274

The live performance was so awesome I also bought one for my mom.  I popped in my DVD and watched it on on my 114""x99"" remote control screen and I felt like I was at the concert.  I wish I could have been there live, because she is an awesome performer.  When I lived in the Bayarea I went to the Lady's First concert (Beyonce, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliot) and I was really blown away by Beyonce and Alicia Keys performance.  If you love the videos then her performances in real life will leave you speechless.

2969949,5,B000WGZGNS,"I love this tour. I wanted to see it when she came to Chicago, but the ticket price was outrageous! Beyonce entertained her fans through her songs, energy, dancers, and her all female band! Here is the setlist:
1. Intro Fanfare - The band plays a sample of Strawberry Letter 23 as B makes her way to the stage.
2. Crazy In Love/Crazy - she performs her first single as a solo artist and mixes it with Gnarls Barkley's version of Crazy which was pretty cool. I also like how she rips the long skirt from her costume, making it a short skirt :)
3. Freakum Dress - very sexy performance. This version is more like a rocked-out version. Loved it!!!
4. Green Light/Band Jam - I liked it. One of my favorites from the B'Day album.
5. Baby Boy/Murder He Wrote - Awesome, but this performance is more for the ladies than the men.
6. Beautiful Liar - good, but it needed Shakira.
7. Naughty Girl - sexy performance. Love the soul clapping.
8. Me, Myself, And I - liked it, but I like the Wembley Arena DVD performance better.
9. Piano Break/Dangerously In Love/He Loves Me - one of my favorite peformances from the DVD. It's very elegant and I love how she mixes Jill Scott's He Loves Me in the song.
10. Flaws and All - pretty good. Towards the end, B sheds some tears while embracing an angel.
11. Cops & Robbers Intro/Destiny's Child Medley (Independent Women Pt 1, Bootylicious, No No No Pt 2, Bug A Boo [Screwed & Chopped Mix], Bills Bills Bills, Cater 2 U, Say My Name, Jumpin Jumpin, Soldier [Soulja Boy Crank Mix], Survivor w. Kelly and Michelle) - loved it. My favorites were Bills Bills Bills and Say My Name. I like how she did the Souja Boy Dance with her dancers.
12. Speechless - I think she could've left this number out.
13. Jailhouse Confessions/Ring The Alarm - HOT! The intro is HOT!!! This is the song where she fell on the flight of stairs at the Orlando show. She didn't fall off of this performance which was good.
14. Suga Mama - pretty hot! I've learned to like this song and I love the performance
15. Upgrade U (feat Jay-Z) - not my favorite song by her, but Jay-Z made a special performance with B.
16. 03 Bonnie & Clyde/Prince Mix - okay, not my favorite.
17. Check On It (Special Tour Version) - LOVED IT!! It cracked me up and it was sexy at the same time.
18. Deja Vu - that's my song and Beyonce's! Wished she sang the second verse, but the performance was great!
19. Bass Jam/Bee Intro/Get Me Bodied (Extended Mix) - She bought it home!! My favorite song and performance from B!
20. Welcome To Hollywood - it's just the song and never before seen footage of Beyonce. Pretty good to watch as B makes her costume change.
21. Dreamgirls - Very interesting! I wish she would've performed the whole song.
22. Listen - Awesome!!
23. Irreplaceable/B'Day Surprise - To the left! To the left! Great song to close the show as well as B's birthday surprise.
Overall, it was a great show. I could watch it a million times and still love it",1198281600,8,2952,4.34963768115942

2969982,4,B000WGZGNS,"I LOVE Beyonce.
I'm pretty much a Stan. And I saw this show in Las Vegas and had loads of fun (even though i was by myself).
However... i cant pretend that this is the perfect show just because i love her to death.

Even during and after I saw the show Live i had some complaints.

But I'll start the review with the positive.
Beyonce is a MONSTER ON STAGE!!!! We all know this, and it has been exhibited on various Dvd's and live performances in the past. One of the very few current entertainers that Dance AND Sing Live at the same time. And mann there are certain parts on this dvd where it's like... Crazy how she is able to do so. Especially in the first three songs, BACK TO BACK UP BEAT, Nothing but Energy and nothing but a full powerful voice.

She sings loads of her hits here, practically all of them.

Here in lies my problem.
Beyonce doesn't seem to know if she wants to be an over the top DIVA type performer or a down home-ish Soul/Funk performer. She goes in and out of both extremes at Too Many points of this show which makes it a little uneven.
I mean she has the all female band, and at very odd and arbitrary points in the show... she'll switch from having this elaborate stage setup with the DIVA clothing and posing to bringing more focus to the band and trying to Funk Out like James Brown or Tina Turner (or herself in the ""Work it Out"" video) with the band.
This just ruins the flow of the show to me, because these parts come at points where it really doesnt make sense or fit with what has been going on.
Another beef i had with this show was the fact that she shortened so many songs. I mean ""Ring the Alarm"" is barely even there anymore. Understandable that she would need to shorten certain parts, but especially in ""RIng the Alarm"" its just annoying and seemingly a waste of time.

The best parts
The Destiny's Child Medley, it goes on for a while, but its really fun and she actually comes with some cool setups and moves for this set. And just hearing those songs again and bringing back memories of the late 90's (SOO long ago LOL) is fun. Plus she does the Soulja Boy Lol.

Irreplaceable, if you go on youtube and look up her performance of this song in Houston. OMG the crowd is singing EVERY NOTE at the top of their lungs. LA thinks they are sooo cool so they don't get loud enuff with it. but this is still probably the best song in her show.

Get me bodied, i was impressed with her vocal ""stamina"" if you will on this performance because she's doing alot of dancing jumpin and Bouncin. but there's rumors that she partially lip'd this part? however i can't tell... i think she sang the whole way through but anyhoo.

Crazy in love, I just love the intro ""ARE YOU READY... TO BE ENTERTAAAAAIIINNNEED"".

Me Myself and I, the part at the Live show where i was like DAAAAM she can sing. she doesn't sound As good as she did on the dvd as she did in Vegas but this is still one of the best parts of the show.

bottom line though.
it's a good show... its actually a great show compared to what other performers are offering these days. However, if your not a huuuge fan i'd skip this.
I believe that in a few years she will deliver the perfect show and decide what type of live performer she really wants to be, because she cant be both.",1197849600,2,3274,4.2073365231259965

2969984,3,B000WGZGNS,"While I enjoyed most of this DVD, I found parts of it to be annoying. Beyonce can put on a show but she left the stage way too much to change and the band played songs that are Beyonce or Destiny's Child related as she changed.

2969985,2,B000WGZGNS,"Now, I have to say that, as much as I enjoy Beyonce as entertainer. This concert didn't do much for me as a fan. I saw this concert when it first aired on Bet. But, I fell asleep during the first half hour. But, I was also still in and of consciousness during two hour broadcast Then I said I want to see her perform ""Flaws &All"" "" Up Grade You ""Beautiful Liar""ect. But, all this concert turned out to be was alot short skits. And to me if I wanted to see a show based on skits. I would have wanted to go see comedy show like ""The Flip Wilson Show"".

But, if there's anything good to be said about this concert is this, to see Beyonce empowering woman by introducing  her all female band members indididually and giving them there moment to shine. Was not only empowdering for me to see as a woman But, a beautiful sight to see. And not to excluded my gentleeman they did a great job as well. The only high light in this concert for me, other then What I have already just expressed is the ""Confession Skit"". The other problem I have with this concert is the sampling of other artist music during her show. I would only get this concert if I were a true blue Beyonce fan.",1197676800,,1171,4.131578947368421
2969986,5,B000WGZGNS,"This is simply an amazing concert. I had the great fortune of being present at this very concert. ""Are you ready to be entertained?"" Hell yes, I am! I couldn't stop dancing, laughing, and screaming for the entire show! Bee's band, back up singers, and dancers all came together to deliver a mesmerizing performance. As usual Bee's vocals were top notch, who else can do all that dancing and still sing flawlessly!? (During 'Naughty Girl' she does this amazing horn sound with her voice!) Her energy through out the show kept everyone on their feet, and the shows pacing was perfect. I don't want to give anything else away for those who haven't seen the show yet... I'll just say that this is a must buy!",1196726400,4,704,4.595238095238095
2969987,5,B000WGZGNS,"Once you have seen Beyonce' Knowles live in concert, you will have a new respect for her.  I had the pleasure of attending ""The Beyonce' Experience"" when it came to Washington, DC, and since then, I have adored her even more.  When Destiny's Child released their first single, ""No, No, No"", it was crystal clear that Beyonce' was not only the star of the group, but also the hardest working one and the one with the most potential.  With this concert on DVD, she proves my stated point.  Throughout the duration of the show, Beyonce' didn't miss a beat, nor did she forget a lyric, nor did I see much sweat!  She made it look so easy, and that impressed me a great deal.

 When she first steps onto the stage, she asks the crowd if they are ready to be entertained.  She, without a doubt, entertains for each minute of the two hours that she is performing!  It's not easy to keep 20,000 people entertained for two hours, but somehow Beyonce' manages to accomplish this task.

  Beyonce' performs all of her biggest hits and also gives us many doses of Destiny's Child's music.  ""Get Me Bodied"" stands out in my mind as one of the best performances because there was non-stop choreography, very creative outfits (she had on black and yellow, hence, her nickname is Bee), and it was simply an energetic performance.  ""Crazy in Love"", ""Me, Myself and I"", and ""Speechless"" are other highlights.  I loved the simplicity of the ""Flaws and All"" performance.  She sounded great, but she incorporated so many emotions with just one song, and it was very touching to watch (how can she make herself cry on cue, on stage??)  ""Irreplaceable"" is another highlight.  Not because she did anything fancy or gaudy, because she didn't, but I love the crowd participation she included, and I liked how she pointed random individuals out from the audience (I.E., she said, ""I see you over there with that Beyonce' poster!"")

 In all honesty, I could go on and on boasting about this DVD, but to really bring into fruition what I am saying, you will have to see it.  This concert is recommended by me, no questions.  ""Are you ready to be entertained?""",1196640000,34,2130,4.60904255319149

No I'm not talking about the Widescreen format, I'm viewing it on a Widescreen tv and the source is stretched vertically and is extremely distracting. I'm not the only one that has noticed this, as another review mentions this issue. Nice show, but terrible presentation by Sony.",1196553600,2,392,4.954545454545454
2969989,5,B000WGZGNS,"Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed.  Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up on in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic.  The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.

I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike other concert DVD's being released this week where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide to weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert DVD's that put you right in the experience (sorry Justin Timberlake).

From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, ""...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,"" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts.  Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.  Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier.  Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.

The DVD's filmed in a beautiful 1.78:1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case) it fills your screen completely (no letterboxing).  The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement.  Running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experience any artist has ever offered.  A must for any music fan.",1196553600,15,1980,4.9878419452887535

2970031,5,B000WGZGNS,"Entertain me!  That she did!!!  This DVD was well worth my money.  Beyonce is an amazing talent, the girl works hard for her money.  She's got the energy of Tina Turner with the glamour of Diana Ross.  I loved that the Destiny Child's girls, Kelli and Michelle join her for a minute, during this concert; it remids you of her roots and reminds you that Beyonce is a Diva, but the group catapulted her to the fame she now enjoys. Everything she got, she deserves and I believe she's going to be right up there in the legend of her own time category, along with Michael Jackson and emerging talent, Chris Brown.",1196380800,3,609,4.401785714285714
2970032,4,B000WGZGNS,"I attended the Beyonce concert when she came to Denver this past August and was blown away! This woman entertains! I was worried that the DVD wouldn't be able to fully capture the excitement of the show, but it does that and more. There are few women who can command a stage for two hours.

The disc opens with Beyonce asking the audience if they are ""...ready to be entertained?!"" She doesn't disappoint as she launches into ""Crazy in Love"" and the sexy ""Freakum Dress"". She holds court as she gives you the full range of her catalogue: first some of her more popular solo material, then her work with former group-mates Destiny's Child, and finally more material from her newest release. Performed live, all of these songs sound fresh, when on record some of the material can seem kind of dated (i.e. 'Bug-a boo', No No No).

  My only problems with the disc / concert were few. The addition of 'Flaws and All' detracts from the excitement of the show as Beyonce's vocal histrionics and simulated tears add nothing to the performance. We all know that Beyonce has a good voice, but she tends to over sing on 'Flaws and All' and 'Dangerously in Love'. As a performer, she is decidedly more Tina Turner than Whitney Houston and she should embrace that. The great thing about that is that she is well on her way to being a great performer in the same way as Tina Turner because she totally gives you all of herself in these two hours. The only other part of the DVD that was upsetting is that there are no extras on it at all.

  In all, this is an excellent purchase for the Beyonce novice or even a longtime fan. Though here in Denver we weren't treated to the guest appearance by Jay Z (of course), I am otherwise completely satisfied with this show. I look forward to more performances by this very talented young woman in the future!",1196121600,2,1837,4.465671641791045

However, she definitely does NOT mess up with The Beyonce Experience. She sings amazingly, she's got a complete live band (unusual for R&B performers) and a wide array of set and costume changes. Highlights for me include: ""Crazy In Love"" (Crazy Mix), ""Freakum Dress,"" ""Beautiful Liar,"" ""Get Me Bodied"" and ""Irreplaceable."" Enjoy the show!",1195948800,8,508,4.850574712643678

2970035,3,B000WGZGNS,"off the bat Beyonce has Personality, charisma and is a Fione Chick. she makes you notice. vocally she is on point. my only knock and it is a big knock is that the majority of her songs are just kinda there to me. she still hasn't made that One cut that i call a signature song. but she sings so well and strongly that she makes the material she does have, feel good and she connects with the crowd and never lets up. the band and background are all cool. Beyonce is worth checking out live.",1195862400,3,490,4.114583333333333
2970036,5,B000WGZGNS,"I am a true fan of Beyonce although I missed her performance in Houston over the summer she really made it up with this show. Despite lacking extras Beyonce and her people really put something together that in my book will never be topped. From the new arrangements of some of the songs down to the House of Dereon/Dereon outfits everyone wore the show was in a class of it's own and Beyonce gave her all. In comparison to the Live At Wembley dvd the Beyonce Experience was very much a drastic improvement seeing as there is a much larger set used. I also must recommend the Beyonce Experience because of the setlist used. There aren't any covers used this time since Beyonce caught plenty of criticism for exposing her fans to different styles. She does the ballads, such as ""Flaws and All"", ""Speechless"" and ""Dangerously In Love"", great justice despite ""DIL"" not being the best compared to past performances (See Live At Wembley and Destiny Fulfilled and Lovin' It). It's also a delight to see Beyonce add in elements of other songs such as adding the music of Prince's ""If Eye Was Ur Girlfriend"" into ""03 Bonnie and Clyde"" as well as Jill Scott's ""He Loves Me"" in ""Dangerously In Love"" which works despite unecessary runs at the end of the song. The appearance of Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams is also nice to see although it doesn't seem that long ago that Destiny's Child broke up. Overall the show is worth it's $10 value because it's funky, refreshing, and creative.",1195776000,5,1479,4.648854961832061
2970037,5,B000WGZGNS,"I went to see Beyonce in NJ at the Meadowlands Arena....James Brown was known as the hardest working man in show biz, and understandably Ms Knowles can take the crown of hardest working female performer.  So Many concerts I've seen where the performer gives you just enough, whereas Beyonce gives you her all.  A two hour show of one performer at concerts is most definately unheard of, but that is what she brung to us, making you feel that you didn't mind spending that kind of cash to see her.  She's definately worth it.

I commend her beauty, talent and humbleness that you felt coming from her throughout her show.  She's truly appreciative of her fans, no question.  I wasn't blessed enough to see Destinys Child and Jay-Z step onto the stage with her, but i did see her mom holding her nephew, and her father was on hand with the sound man throughout the show and he was friendly and glad that we were having such a great time.

Beyonce, I've been a fan of hers from day one, and have all her music, yet at the Beyonce Experience concert I was astounded at her range in vocals that people (the haters) don't hear on her cd's.

Lastly, I will go to ANY concert that Beyonce graces us with in the future.",1195776000,7,1210,4.394618834080718
2970038,5,B000WGZGNS,"I haven't seen her in person but I got to see this in the theater's on a One Night Only event and was blown away. Now I've seen Janet on the ""Rhythm Nation Tour"" and Prince on his ""Purple Rain Tour"". This ranks up there with those. Beyonce is such a BIG star but she seems approachably and will talk to anyone. Her perfoming gets better each time I see her. Her band was INCREDIBLE also. All Females and will give any all Male band a run for their money. I'm buying this DVD tomorrow and will never sell it.",1195689600,4,507,4.08
2970039,3,B000WGZGNS,"I Saw this show in phoenix and when i left I was in awe! She looked amazing and she soundedgood but i noticed one thing in particular! I could not put my finger on it but then it hit me...""AIT I seen this before!""Thinking back it was from her first solo tour! For most of her older songs, she used the same dances and also she used the sqame back ground video. The stage was nothing to be proud of just a flat lit up stage with a few stairs. where was the special effects? Get this guys she still is useing the same dance that DC3 used for soliger! She added too many songs to her set list she kinda pushed her way through them...IN HER DEFENCE THOUGH i LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE HAD AN ALL GIRL BAND AND THE NEW DANCES WERE WELL PERFORMED!",1195603200,2,737,4.020408163265306

3204021,5,B000WGZGNS,"I am a huge Beyonce fan so I may be a little biased, but she really did her thing on this tour. I love how she has an all female band and women of all shapes and sizes dancing with and behind her and singing as well. She takes our old favorites and spices them up with mixes of current songs and dances. (My favorites would have to be the ""Crank That"" Soldier Mix...Beyonce does what she does best...and the other would have to be the new version of Baby Boy with the extended reggae mix). She finally performed Flaws and All and I love how the camera is on her and she connects with her fans. The entire set, theme, and flow of the show was great. I am still questioning some of her choice in set outfits, (like the sequins on the swimsuit...?) But overall it was an incredible experience, and I wish I was there to witness her in action-her stage presence and the way she interacts with her fans is incredible. There is no other performer like her right now who can sing, dance, and truly give you your money's worth of an entertaining show.

The flip side...is Kelly and Michelle came out for a chorus of Survivor-which was hilarious to me because she had just finished an ENTIRE set of Destiny's Child songs by herself! Just watching Bee perform only reflects the superstar that she is and she is deserving of that title-I think Kelly and Michelle are nice, but they are mediocre they are not on Bee's level and its not because her dad put her in the spotlight SHE works her butt off and is smart and when you watch this DVD of her concert you will agree. She goes out on the stage and leaves her blood, sweet, and tears with the audience and you can fill that passion...that always makes for an incredible artist. This DVD is worth the money whether you are a Beyonce fan or not.",1195516800,9,1784,4.293768545994065
3204022,5,B000WGZGNS,"I was at the Lake Tahoe show just two weeks before this DVD was filmed and I must say BEYONCE is one of the Greatest entertainers AND she IS hands down the most BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in the entire world. The Lake Tahoe show was GREAT and usually I can't swallow LIVE DVD's in just ONE sitting, but THIS ONE...I could, in fact THIS IS the perfect souviner if you went to one of her shows this past summer. Whatever I did miss when I saw her live due to TALL people in the way obstructing my view, I was finally able to see it on this. I give this 5 stars, the energy, the performance is GREAT and I recommend this to ALL, the ONLY thing that would have made it better was if Kelly and Michelle would have been out there for the Destiny's Child medley, rather than just at the end of SURVIVOR, I STILL hope that they RE-UNITE one day in the future. My favorite Highlights of the DVD for me is when she does BEAUTIFUL LIAR...which I personally thought was GREAT (But NOT long enough)and the closing number ""IRREPLACEABLE"" with the crowd singing the entire first verse, I got a case of goosebumps when we did that in Tahoe, it was the same feeling watching it happen on DVD...GET THIS!!!! It's GREAT!!!!",1195516800,6,1193,4.283185840707965
3204023,3,B000WGZGNS,"This concert was okay, but I think her Beyonce - Live at Wembley (DVD with Bonus CD) was a lot better.  But even better is Destiny's Child farewell concert DVD.  If you want to see her and her girls at their best, get that one.

She didn't seem to give the same energy we've seen her give before.  It's like she was holding back so she wouldn't tire herself out through out the concert and it seems like her back up singers did most of the singing. Maybe because she looks a little more out of shape than she did in her previous concerts.

Also, the video is streched to make her look thinner (like Paula Abdul's Promise of a New Day Music Video).  It kind of disturbs the eyes after awhile and makes you think you got a bad copy.

Beyonce is a great artist, one of the best of her time, but this DVD did not deliver what I hoped it would.",1195516800,9,839,4.079268292682927

3204026,3,B000WGZGNS,"The Beyonce' Experience was Beyonce' Knowles's first headlining tour as a solo artist and lives up to everything you can expect it to be, based on what you're usually used to seeing from her.  Very glamourous, very flirty, very seductive, and over the top at times, Beyonce' pulled out all the stops on this outing as she breezed through her huge catalogue of hits in a 2-hour set that garnered nothing but positive reviews and praise when she toured the states the Summer of 2007 (sans the unfortunate pyrotechnics mishap in St. Louis and serious tumble down the stairs during ""Ring the Alarm"" in Orlando).

While clearly realizing with certain numbers that ""we've seen it all before,"" from her ""Ring the Alarm"" performance a la the 2006 MTV Music Awards to her Kylie Minogue-inspired robot opening of ""Get Me Bodied"" from the 2007 BET Awards, along with familiar recreations of the videos on her B'Day Anthology Album DVD, it's the energy and commitment Beyonce brings to the stage that sells this entire tour, next to her Southern charm and beauty.  To see it in a live setting is just something that has to be admired, as opposed to watching countless award show appearances and performances and videos in the comfort of your home.  Even watching this DVD you can only imagine the rush of seeing her perform live.  However, there was nothing fancy about the show: no elaborate sets or gaudy costumes, not a whole lot of lights and explosions.  Along with her all female band, buxom backup singers known as ""The Mamas,"" and a fierce dance troupe, next to the star herself, you tend to finish the show wishing for just a little bit more.

The set list was (which may stray slightly from the DVD release):
Crazy in Love
Freakum Dress
Green Light
Baby Boy
Beautiful Liar
Naughty Girl
Me, Myself And I
Dangerously In Love
Flaws & All
DC3 Medley

Happy B'Day

The performance at the Staples Center differs from other performances during the trek as Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams join her on stage for ""Survivor"" and Jay-Z during ""Upgrade U.""

Highlights:
-After stripping the floor length gown off and into a sizzling mini-dress, she steers away from the original song to sing ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley.  She also does this when she sings ""Dangerously in Love,"" quickly switching into Jill Scott's ""He Loves Me"" for the remainder of the track.
-Beyonce cried during ""Flaws and All"" at mulitple shows
-The ""Welcome to Hollywood"" swell captured some never-before-seen footage of Beyonce behind the scenes

Some ""Iffy"" Points:
-Beyonce was unable to hold her own on the songs that didn't require just her, i.e. ""Beautiful Liar,"" which seemed out of place without Shakira, and most of the Destiny's Child songs
-Some of the songs had a twist on them that really should've been left out like the Chopped & Screwed mix of ""Bug a Boo"" and the slowed up version of ""Check On It.""
-While it's realized that she wanted to give her fans all that she's offered musically, she tried to jumble way too many songs into the show, some should've clearly been omitted so that others could've been performed in their entirety
-The ""Dreamgirls"" sequence was just a little too much and could've been executed differently

While some may contend that the lack of extra effects and high ticket cost (single seats topped $200 in some cities, not to mention up to over $1000 for fan club exclusive seats and a once in a lifetime meet and greet) was not worth it, the ""experience"" was clearly the making of a music superstar who has many years ahead of her to perfect her craft to icon status.  This is a DVD must-have for any fan of Beyonce, Destiny's Child, or person who was unable to score tickets to one of the most anticipated tours of 2007.",1195344000,20,4023,4.713675213675214

Beyonce is right on top of things throughout the show, and her band and dancers are also incredibly skilled and well-drilled. The amount of rehearsal and stage coordination that must have gone into this production is simply staggering, and it seems to come off without a hitch!  I like the way that - on this tour - Beyonce makes room to showcase her band members in a solo spot (her Japanese pianist, among others, is remarkable), and the way the musical soundscape gives nods to classic performers and influences along the way (e.g. the implied  'Love Supreme' riff behind the sax solo spot.). I also think that Beyonce is remarkably down to earth and genuine for such a huge megastar. She warmly talks to the large crowd like they are friends, and obviously loves what she is doing. Overall, this DVD captures a great modern r&b artist at the peak of her considerable powers as a stage performer.",1451174400,,1005,4.7371428571428575

Beyonce has got to be one of the hardest working singers i have ever seen after watching this dvd!
She non-stops dances while pulling off crazy notes on the mic.
what a superstar this girl is.
her dancing in crazy in love is just ridiculous i don't even know how her body moves like that
her vocals in dangerously in love will match any female vocalist .. including christina aguilera.. who i am obsessed with so thats saying alot!
her personality and sexiness on stage is whats most entertaining.
her 'i am woman, hear me roar' attitude is so uplifting and inspiring to every person in the world.
and she is so cute in ugrade u with jay-z when he is rapping her interaction with him is adorable
GET THIS DVD!!
I HAVE WATCHED IT ATLEAST 140 TIMES!

The production quality is outstanding, with the hard work that's gone into the variety of different numbers, and Beyonce over-delivers as always in a world-class performance.  Seeing stunning clarity and energy captured on blu-ray from one of the world's top performers is a memorable experience; I've re-watched this dvd many times - it's great.

On this dvd, my favorite tracks are deja vu, get me bodied, check on it, naughty girl, baby boy, beautiful liar, and crazy in love.  Sensational work ethic and performance from everyone, B and the dancers and band did a great job delivering a high energy concert - worth watching many times.  The showmanship on this is outstanding, the energy and excitement are fun to watch, and this is a great dvd.  Thx to Beyonce and team for doing it right... nice job!

Item arrived in perfect condition, sealed in the original shrink wrap. And the concert disc plays like a charm. This is a great DVD and I would recommend that everybody watch it at some point. Beyonce puts on an incredible performance, and no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy the show. There is something for everybody. It was such a thorough production too. The music, the singing, the dancing, the acting, the musicianship, the list goes on and on. Long story short, buy it and you won't be disappointed. Seriously. Oh, oh, oh! And the one reason I bought this was for the enormous Destiny's Child medley in the middle of the concert. Spectacular. Brought me back to the glory days of Destiny's Child. Epic!",1284768000,,843,4.702702702702703
3204216,5,B000WGZGNS,"I had previously heard some of Beyonce's songs and seen a few of her videos, and I found them to be decent, though nothing really special.  But yesterday, I watched this concert DVD, and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed!

This gal has it all.  For starters, of course she's gorgeous and oozes a distinctly innocent sexiness.  Beyond this important superficiality, I was delighted to discover that she has abundant ability as an artist.  Most strikingly, I was blown away by how good a singer she is - easily in the top echelon of pop and R&B singers.  Next add that she's a great dancer (and somehow all that dancing never seemed to cause her to sweat or get out of breath!).  Finally, as a performer, she portrays her characters like a true actor, and her interaction with the audience is sincere and engaging.

As an overall package, this (long) concert coheres well, with a nice variety of great songs, ranging from heartful ballads to bumpin grooves, all sequenced to form a natural flow.  Complementing that, we get an understated but effective use of costume changes and lighting.  Last but not least, her dancers are solid and her all-female band is super tight (I especially enjoyed the two drummers).

Again, this is a great concert, and Beyonce demonstrates that she's a great artist and performer who deserves her success.  Add me to her fan club!

7/25/10 Update: I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this DVD, and it's well worth it.  The improvement in visual clarity is huge.

Truly, BeyOnCe is the greatest performer I've ever watched. I own a lot of Concert DVD and I could say that this concert experience showed what the true entertainment is. From the Opening till the end she gave her best. The stage was really conceptualized to fit on each of the song and her personality, there were no dull performance. The Light Effects on the stage made the concert so Fabulous and Amazing and I think that's what made the concert Great. Another thing she doesn't forget where she came from, From being in a Girl group (Destiny's Child) and She still sang their hit songs, even though she has her own already. Personally my favorite prod here was the Get me Bodied, the routine impressed me lot, the costumes, the routines, her sexiness and her being artistic. So the Question is ARE YOU READY TO BE ENTERTAIN ??? Well if you want, grab a copy of this from Amazon !!!",1271203200,,1075,5.3609467455621305

It seems she tried to sing every hit she ever made and I grew tired of watching and listening to her.  I think she should have left out the Destiny's Child material and the DC reunion.  She's got boundless energy and visually she is quite stunning.  The show was entertaining for the most part and her costumes were very pretty, except the one where she has the jewels on her bottom.  I guess the editing was top notch as well, because I never heard her miss a note or lose her breath.  There's one song, something about her flaws, that I really liked.  I'd never heard that one before.  The audience there for the taping experienced a real treat, but watching this 2 hour spectacle proved to be a chore for me.

Now if your impressed with a moderately attractive half naked curvy woman who shakes, struts, wiggles and flaunts her body on stage then yes you will love this DVD.

The video production in Blu-ray brings up how truly beautiful and talented she really is.  You know how good the performer is when you see a live performance.  Beyonce really delivers in this video and makes it look easy.  She dances as good or even better than her backup dancers while delivering excellent vocals. You will be able to witness the energy of her fine,live performance.

If you have a sound system the recording of the music, sounds concert like.  I have an older-tube hd TV running the video at 1080i and the video reproduction remains great.

I recommend a buy for this Blu-ray of Beyonce; you will not regret your purchase.

The video production is wonderful - very crisp and colorful on screen. The audio is top notch as well, and it's great to see a live performance throughout the concert. This is an artist that truly describes the word. She captivates the audience (and the viewer if I may say so) to sing along with and dance with her every move. Some of my favorite performances are: Suga Mama, Naughty Girl and Suga Mama.

3204328,5,B000WGZGNS,"Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed. Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic. The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.

I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike others where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide the weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert video's that put you right in the experience using camera angles that allow you to actually SEE THE PERFORMANCE.

From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, ""...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,"" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts. Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier. Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.

The Blu-Ray image is presented in beautiful 1080p and a 1:78.1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case); it fills your screen completely without letterboxing. The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement. The PCM audio will drive the neighbors to call the police on you because of the explosive sound quality.  For the Blu-Ray fans who like all those fancy little extras, sorry you'll be disappointed.  The video is a direct port of the DVD version.  Even still, running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experiences any artist has ever offered.

This concert was great. Beyonce sings and dance her heart out in every number. Don't expect too many surprises though, because this DVD is basically an upgrade from her ""Beyonce - Live at Wembley"". She took the concepts of her first solo DVD and Destiny's Child farewell Atlanta DVD and upgraded the performances a level or two. That's not a bad thing, but I expected to see a little more from her.

I have only two real complaints: There is no bonus footage (behind the scenes footage, interview, or bonus track). In this day and time, you expect more from an artist and I think Beyonce short-changed us on the extra stuff. Its no wonder Christina Aguilera's DVD is doing better than Beyonce's (despite costing more).

The other complaint I have is the video is stretched. Why? To make her appear thinner? It didn't work because even though Beyonce is beautiful, you can tell she was heavier than her last tour. I just find it tacky that they tried to cover that up by stretching the video.

Now on to the Best Parts:

*This show began with a bang! Beyonce popped out of the stage floor with a glamorous gown tightly fitted over her curvaceous body. Midway into her singing, prancing, and booty bouncing through her hit ""Crazy in Love"" she snaps the tail of her dress to reveal a dress more fitting for the ""uh oh"" dance. Then she meshes in the mega hit ""CRAZY"" by Gnarls Barkley, and heads on straight to her crazy adlibs.
*For Freakum Dress Beyonce added a lil stylish soul and aggressive rock to the pop number, creating a really sexy combination!
*On Me Myself and I Beyonce sings a more soulful, smoky, and heartfelt version of her 2003 hit ""Me Myself and I"", making this my personal fave of the night.
*On Dangerously in Love Beyonce smoothly mixes in a lovely melody by Jill Scott, the Underground hit ""He Loves Me"". Although this was no comparison to Jill's booming yet more masterfully skilled vocals that i had heard just the previous summer at the Suger Water Fest, Beyonce did her thing and gave a pleasing performance.
*Another highlight was Beyonce's performance of Upgrade U, her current urban hit with hubby Jay Z, who unfortunately didn't show up at my concert, but laid down a tight verse on the DVD version.
*The Destiny's Child Medley: Smooth. Really shines even without the other DC members. Really cute performance of ""Soldier"".

However this DVD does have some downsides:

*some songs were shortened so much that they were ending just as I was getting into the groove
*Beautiful Liar (performed WITHOUT the queen of hipshaking Shakira) and Dreamgirls were really boring and have no purpose for being on the DVD.
how i regret not going to the bathroom during these time-wasting spots.
*no extra features on the DVD,
but special features usually suck anyways, and its absence doesn't really hinder the overall captivating and energetic essence of the show
*Suga Mama was a real let down for those who deemed this their fave song from Beyonce as I did. Most of this amazing song was lip-synched as Beyonce took a whiff of a cigarette and stripper-danced around a pole throughout the first and second verses of the wonderfully candy-laced song(which you really can't see from where I was at the 80th row). It wasn't until the bridge that beyonce began to sing (and believe me you can tell the difference). Although she added some crazy adlibs at the end, I just wasn't satisfied. Frankly, I was expecting the same exciting energy-filled, hormone-induced performance she gave for ""Work It Out"" in her less than stellar Dangerously in Love Tour.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert and the DVD; from its live band instrumentation to live backing singers with their powerful voices and great harmonizing skills (a grade or two up from the way beyonce's former group members, Kelly & Michelle, would just stand around and lip-synch the chorus as shown in their guest appearance during ""Survivor"").

I was certainly entertained by the sexy male dancers, the shiny, fashionable, gowns (in silver, my favorite color!), Beyonce's excellent stage presence, eye-catching choreography, as well as her energetic and estrogen filled performance. I especially enjoyed the female empowering theme present throughout the whole show! Nonetheless, men will enjoy the sexy ladies on stage, from Beyonce, to her stunning dancers, and be enraptured by the power of catchy beats combined with glitter and extensively polished yet at times soulful vocals. Despite its few let downs, it is compensated for by its many benefits and cheap price, making it a wonderful as a gift or an addition to your own DVD collection. 4.5 Stars.",1207267200,2,3882,4.901065449010654

3204366,5,B000WGZGNS,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. Before I bought this dvd I was not a huge fan of Beyonce's music although I found her visually very appealing & thought she was a good dancer. But this concert was amazing, Beyonce sounded beautiful: doing several acapella sections to demonstrate her control over her fabulous voice. This DVD proved one thing to me: Beyonce can really sing!

I loved the parts where she was just singing.

I also loved the dancing, OMG, the dancing was incredible and as usual all of the outfits in this show were all show-stoppers. Beyonce looked smoking hot and elegant at the same time: how does she dance in those heels?

I loved the moments where she let the members of her band play their instruments solo it shows how much individual talents she has in her band. She also did a reggae segment that I loved.

All of Beyonce's team was on point for this one, The back up singers were fabulous, the dancers were great and the all female band was rocking!

This DVD also has special appearances by Jay Z and Destiny's Child.

While watching this concert I was reminded of just how many hits Beyonce has been a part of over the past few years. She performed all her major hits from Destiny's child, Dangeroulsly in Love and B'day including music from the Dreamgirls soundtrack and ""Check On It"" from The Pink Panther movie.

Also it must be said that the stage & the lights were AMAZING.

I loved this DVD, 10 stars!",1205366400,3,1442,4.498084291187739
3204367,4,B000WGZGNS,"I've never been a Beyonce fan. I hear her music from time to time and bob my head or do a little dance, but I've never been one to purchase her music, let alone go see her perform. I never doubted her ability to entertain---let's face it, she was BORN to do this! But after hearing so many people exclaim how awesome this concert was, I just had to check it out.

I was pleasantly surprised. She keeps it moving throughout. The production is stellar. From her band, to her dancers, to her on stage, she keeps your eyes locked and glued anticipating what will happen next. One thing I loved about this is how she highlighted her musicians, allowing them their moments to display their talents while she dressed or  changed or took a break, whatever. She gave props to the big band behind her. Also, with the backup singers and the dancers, she allowed them their moment to shine---the focus, surprisingly, was taken 'away' from Beyonce for awhile. She incorporated songs from other artists into her works and revamped/remixed her songs.

Overall, it was an absolute solid production, much better I think (at least more energetic and LIVE! than her Dangerously in Love tour).

The only thing I missed from this piece was special features. The DVD offers you the ability to 'remix' the various songs, streaming them through your computer or television for 'listening' sake, but it didn't have any behind-the-scenes footage as did her first tour. I think fans would love more to be able to see Beyonce, not only in her element on stage, but behind the curtain. How does she prepare? What all is involved in this production that wasn't in the first?

She is truly an awesome performer and while I didn't think B'Day was all that great compared to her previous work and works with Destiny's Child, she manages to incorporate the best of her sophomore release intermixed with selections from DIL and Destiny's Child's catalog of work. I can only imagine what theme her next production will take on. Four stars for The Beyonce Experience!

I wish I could have been there live, because she is an awesome performer.  When I lived in the Bayarea I went to the Lady's First concert (Beyonce, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliot) and I was really blown away by Beyonce and Alicia Keys performance.

3204446,5,B000WGZGNS,"I love this tour. I wanted to see it when she came to Chicago, but the ticket price was outrageous! Beyonce entertained her fans through her songs, energy, dancers, and her all female band! Here is the setlist:
1. Intro Fanfare - The band plays a sample of Strawberry Letter 23 as B makes her way to the stage.
2. Crazy In Love/Crazy - she performs her first single as a solo artist and mixes it with Gnarls Barkley's version of Crazy which was pretty cool. I also like how she rips the long skirt from her costume, making it a short skirt :)
3. Freakum Dress - very sexy performance. This version is more like a rocked-out version. Loved it!!!
4. Green Light/Band Jam - I liked it. One of my favorites from the B'Day album.
5. Baby Boy/Murder He Wrote - Awesome, but this performance is more for the ladies than the men.
6. Beautiful Liar - good, but it needed Shakira.
7. Naughty Girl - sexy performance. Love the soul clapping.
8. Me, Myself, And I - liked it, but I like the Wembley Arena DVD performance better.
9. Piano Break/Dangerously In Love/He Loves Me - one of my favorite peformances from the DVD. It's very elegant and I love how she mixes Jill Scott's He Loves Me in the song.
10. Flaws and All - pretty good. Towards the end, B sheds some tears while embracing an angel.
11. Cops & Robbers Intro/Destiny's Child Medley (Independent Women Pt 1, Bootylicious, No No No Pt 2, Bug A Boo [Screwed & Chopped Mix], Bills Bills Bills, Cater 2 U, Say My Name, Jumpin Jumpin, Soldier [Soulja Boy Crank Mix], Survivor w. Kelly and Michelle) - loved it. My favorites were Bills Bills Bills and Say My Name. I like how she did the Souja Boy Dance with her dancers.
12. Speechless - I think she could've left this number out.
13. Jailhouse Confessions/Ring The Alarm - HOT! The intro is HOT!!! This is the song where she fell on the flight of stairs at the Orlando show. She didn't fall off of this performance which was good.
14. Suga Mama - pretty hot! I've learned to like this song and I love the performance
15. Upgrade U (feat Jay-Z) - not my favorite song by her, but Jay-Z made a special performance with B.
16. 03 Bonnie & Clyde/Prince Mix - okay, not my favorite.
17. Check On It (Special Tour Version) - LOVED IT!! It cracked me up and it was sexy at the same time.
18. Deja Vu - that's my song and Beyonce's! Wished she sang the second verse, but the performance was great!
19. Bass Jam/Bee Intro/Get Me Bodied (Extended Mix) - She bought it home!! My favorite song and performance from B!
20. Welcome To Hollywood - it's just the song and never before seen footage of Beyonce. Pretty good to watch as B makes her costume change.
21. Dreamgirls - Very interesting! I wish she would've performed the whole song.
22. Listen - Awesome!!
23. Irreplaceable/B'Day Surprise - To the left! To the left! Great song to close the show as well as B's birthday surprise.

3204479,4,B000WGZGNS,"I LOVE Beyonce.
I'm pretty much a Stan. And I saw this show in Las Vegas and had loads of fun (even though i was by myself).
However... i cant pretend that this is the perfect show just because i love her to death.

Even during and after I saw the show Live i had some complaints.

But I'll start the review with the positive.
Beyonce is a MONSTER ON STAGE!!!! We all know this, and it has been exhibited on various Dvd's and live performances in the past. One of the very few current entertainers that Dance AND Sing Live at the same time. And mann there are certain parts on this dvd where it's like... Crazy how she is able to do so. Especially in the first three songs, BACK TO BACK UP BEAT, Nothing but Energy and nothing but a full powerful voice.

She sings loads of her hits here, practically all of them.

Here in lies my problem.
Beyonce doesn't seem to know if she wants to be an over the top DIVA type performer or a down home-ish Soul/Funk performer. She goes in and out of both extremes at Too Many points of this show which makes it a little uneven.
I mean she has the all female band, and at very odd and arbitrary points in the show... she'll switch from having this elaborate stage setup with the DIVA clothing and posing to bringing more focus to the band and trying to Funk Out like James Brown or Tina Turner (or herself in the ""Work it Out"" video) with the band.
This just ruins the flow of the show to me, because these parts come at points where it really doesnt make sense or fit with what has been going on.
Another beef i had with this show was the fact that she shortened so many songs. I mean ""Ring the Alarm"" is barely even there anymore. Understandable that she would need to shorten certain parts, but especially in ""RIng the Alarm"" its just annoying and seemingly a waste of time.

The best parts
The Destiny's Child Medley, it goes on for a while, but its really fun and she actually comes with some cool setups and moves for this set. And just hearing those songs again and bringing back memories of the late 90's (SOO long ago LOL) is fun. Plus she does the Soulja Boy Lol.

Irreplaceable, if you go on youtube and look up her performance of this song in Houston. OMG the crowd is singing EVERY NOTE at the top of their lungs. LA thinks they are sooo cool so they don't get loud enuff with it. but this is still probably the best song in her show.

Get me bodied, i was impressed with her vocal ""stamina"" if you will on this performance because she's doing alot of dancing jumpin and Bouncin. but there's rumors that she partially lip'd this part? however i can't tell... i think she sang the whole way through but anyhoo.

Crazy in love, I just love the intro ""ARE YOU READY... TO BE ENTERTAAAAAIIINNNEED"".

Me Myself and I, the part at the Live show where i was like DAAAAM she can sing. she doesn't sound As good as she did on the dvd as she did in Vegas but this is still one of the best parts of the show.

bottom line though.
it's a good show... its actually a great show compared to what other performers are offering these days. However, if your not a huuuge fan i'd skip this.
I believe that in a few years she will deliver the perfect show and decide what type of live performer she really wants to be, because she cant be both.",1197849600,2,3274,4.2073365231259965

3204482,2,B000WGZGNS,"Now, I have to say that, as much as I enjoy Beyonce as entertainer. This concert didn't do much for me as a fan. I saw this concert when it first aired on Bet. But, I fell asleep during the first half hour. But, I was also still in and of consciousness during two hour broadcast Then I said I want to see her perform ""Flaws &All"" "" Up Grade You ""Beautiful Liar""ect. But, all this concert turned out to be was alot short skits. And to me if I wanted to see a show based on skits. I would have wanted to go see comedy show like ""The Flip Wilson Show"".

But, if there's anything good to be said about this concert is this, to see Beyonce empowering woman by introducing  her all female band members indididually and giving them there moment to shine. Was not only empowdering for me to see as a woman But, a beautiful sight to see. And not to excluded my gentleeman they did a great job as well. The only high light in this concert for me, other then What I have already just expressed is the ""Confession Skit"".

As usual Bee's vocals were top notch, who else can do all that dancing and still sing flawlessly!? (During 'Naughty Girl' she does this amazing horn sound with her voice!) Her energy through out the show kept everyone on their feet, and the shows pacing was perfect. I don't want to give anything else away for those who haven't seen the show yet...

3204484,5,B000WGZGNS,"Once you have seen Beyonce' Knowles live in concert, you will have a new respect for her.  I had the pleasure of attending ""The Beyonce' Experience"" when it came to Washington, DC, and since then, I have adored her even more.  When Destiny's Child released their first single, ""No, No, No"", it was crystal clear that Beyonce' was not only the star of the group, but also the hardest working one and the one with the most potential.  With this concert on DVD, she proves my stated point.  Throughout the duration of the show, Beyonce' didn't miss a beat, nor did she forget a lyric, nor did I see much sweat!  She made it look so easy, and that impressed me a great deal.

 When she first steps onto the stage, she asks the crowd if they are ready to be entertained.  She, without a doubt, entertains for each minute of the two hours that she is performing!  It's not easy to keep 20,000 people entertained for two hours, but somehow Beyonce' manages to accomplish this task.

  Beyonce' performs all of her biggest hits and also gives us many doses of Destiny's Child's music.  ""Get Me Bodied"" stands out in my mind as one of the best performances because there was non-stop choreography, very creative outfits (she had on black and yellow, hence, her nickname is Bee), and it was simply an energetic performance.  ""Crazy in Love"", ""Me, Myself and I"", and ""Speechless"" are other highlights.  I loved the simplicity of the ""Flaws and All"" performance.  She sounded great, but she incorporated so many emotions with just one song, and it was very touching to watch (how can she make herself cry on cue, on stage??)  ""Irreplaceable"" is another highlight.  Not because she did anything fancy or gaudy, because she didn't, but I love the crowd participation she included, and I liked how she pointed random individuals out from the audience (I.E., she said, ""I see you over there with that Beyonce' poster!"")

 In all honesty, I could go on and on boasting about this DVD, but to really bring into fruition what I am saying, you will have to see it.  This concert is recommended by me, no questions.  ""Are you ready to be entertained?""",1196640000,34,2130,4.60904255319149

3204486,5,B000WGZGNS,"Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed.  Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up on in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic.  The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.

I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike other concert DVD's being released this week where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide to weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert DVD's that put you right in the experience (sorry Justin Timberlake).

From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, ""...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,"" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts.  Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.  Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier.  Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.

The DVD's filmed in a beautiful 1.78:1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case) it fills your screen completely (no letterboxing).  The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement.  Running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experience any artist has ever offered.  A must for any music fan.",1196553600,15,1980,4.9878419452887535
3204487,5,B000WGZGNS,Beyonce's performance was absolutely fabulous! She really shows her talent in this concert. Her vocals are on point and the dances are great! It's a great dvd to add to my collection!,1196467200,3,183,4.75
3204528,5,B000WGZGNS,"Entertain me!  That she did!!!  This DVD was well worth my money.  Beyonce is an amazing talent, the girl works hard for her money.  She's got the energy of Tina Turner with the glamour of Diana Ross.  I loved that the Destiny Child's girls, Kelli and Michelle join her for a minute, during this concert; it remids you of her roots and reminds you that Beyonce is a Diva, but the group catapulted her to the fame she now enjoys. Everything she got, she deserves and I believe she's going to be right up there in the legend of her own time category, along with Michael Jackson and emerging talent, Chris Brown.",1196380800,3,609,4.401785714285714
3204529,4,B000WGZGNS,"I attended the Beyonce concert when she came to Denver this past August and was blown away! This woman entertains! I was worried that the DVD wouldn't be able to fully capture the excitement of the show, but it does that and more. There are few women who can command a stage for two hours.

The disc opens with Beyonce asking the audience if they are ""...ready to be entertained?!"" She doesn't disappoint as she launches into ""Crazy in Love"" and the sexy ""Freakum Dress"". She holds court as she gives you the full range of her catalogue: first some of her more popular solo material, then her work with former group-mates Destiny's Child, and finally more material from her newest release. Performed live, all of these songs sound fresh, when on record some of the material can seem kind of dated (i.e. 'Bug-a boo', No No No).

  My only problems with the disc / concert were few. The addition of 'Flaws and All' detracts from the excitement of the show as Beyonce's vocal histrionics and simulated tears add nothing to the performance. We all know that Beyonce has a good voice, but she tends to over sing on 'Flaws and All' and 'Dangerously in Love'. As a performer, she is decidedly more Tina Turner than Whitney Houston and she should embrace that. The great thing about that is that she is well on her way to being a great performer in the same way as Tina Turner because she totally gives you all of herself in these two hours. The only other part of the DVD that was upsetting is that there are no extras on it at all.

  In all, this is an excellent purchase for the Beyonce novice or even a longtime fan. Though here in Denver we weren't treated to the guest appearance by Jay Z (of course), I am otherwise completely satisfied with this show. I look forward to more performances by this very talented young woman in the future!",1196121600,2,1837,4.465671641791045
3204530,5,B000WGZGNS,"I'm as big of a Beyonce fan as they come, but I can admit when the girl messes up (like her previous live DVD, ""Live At Wembley"" [I found it tacky, unorganized, etc.]). However, she definitely does NOT mess up with The Beyonce Experience. She sings amazingly, she's got a complete live band (unusual for R&B performers) and a wide array of set and costume changes. Highlights for me include: ""Crazy In Love"" (Crazy Mix), ""Freakum Dress,"" ""Beautiful Liar,"" ""Get Me Bodied"" and ""Irreplaceable."" Enjoy the show!",1195948800,8,508,4.850574712643678
3204531,1,B000WGZGNS,"Beyonce let me down once again. I had high hopes for the album Bday and was greatly disappointed. So, I should have known that this dvd would prove to be the same. I was not entertained at all. Beyonce's screaming became annoying and muteable. To check out a real show by the voice of my generation, please buy Christina Aguilera's new dvd Back to Basics Live. You will be ENTERTAINED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1195948800,8,421,5.0285714285714285
3204532,3,B000WGZGNS,"off the bat Beyonce has Personality, charisma and is a Fione Chick. she makes you notice. vocally she is on point. my only knock and it is a big knock is that the majority of her songs are just kinda there to me. she still hasn't made that One cut that i call a signature song. but she sings so well and strongly that she makes the material she does have, feel good and she connects with the crowd and never lets up. the band and background are all cool. Beyonce is worth checking out live.",1195862400,3,490,4.114583333333333
3204533,5,B000WGZGNS,"I am a true fan of Beyonce although I missed her performance in Houston over the summer she really made it up with this show. Despite lacking extras Beyonce and her people really put something together that in my book will never be topped. From the new arrangements of some of the songs down to the House of Dereon/Dereon outfits everyone wore the show was in a class of it's own and Beyonce gave her all. In comparison to the Live At Wembley dvd the Beyonce Experience was very much a drastic improvement seeing as there is a much larger set used. I also must recommend the Beyonce Experience because of the setlist used. There aren't any covers used this time since Beyonce caught plenty of criticism for exposing her fans to different styles. She does the ballads, such as ""Flaws and All"", ""Speechless"" and ""Dangerously In Love"", great justice despite ""DIL"" not being the best compared to past performances (See Live At Wembley and Destiny Fulfilled and Lovin' It). It's also a delight to see Beyonce add in elements of other songs such as adding the music of Prince's ""If Eye Was Ur Girlfriend"" into ""03 Bonnie and Clyde"" as well as Jill Scott's ""He Loves Me"" in ""Dangerously In Love"" which works despite unecessary runs at the end of the song. The appearance of Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams is also nice to see although it doesn't seem that long ago that Destiny's Child broke up. Overall the show is worth it's $10 value because it's funky, refreshing, and creative.",1195776000,5,1479,4.648854961832061
3204534,5,B000WGZGNS,"I went to see Beyonce in NJ at the Meadowlands Arena....James Brown was known as the hardest working man in show biz, and understandably Ms Knowles can take the crown of hardest working female performer.  So Many concerts I've seen where the performer gives you just enough, whereas Beyonce gives you her all.  A two hour show of one performer at concerts is most definately unheard of, but that is what she brung to us, making you feel that you didn't mind spending that kind of cash to see her.  She's definately worth it.

I commend her beauty, talent and humbleness that you felt coming from her throughout her show.  She's truly appreciative of her fans, no question.  I wasn't blessed enough to see Destinys Child and Jay-Z step onto the stage with her, but i did see her mom holding her nephew, and her father was on hand with the sound man throughout the show and he was friendly and glad that we were having such a great time.

Beyonce, I've been a fan of hers from day one, and have all her music, yet at the Beyonce Experience concert I was astounded at her range in vocals that people (the haters) don't hear on her cd's.

Lastly, I will go to ANY concert that Beyonce graces us with in the future.",1195776000,7,1210,4.394618834080718
3204535,5,B000WGZGNS,"I haven't seen her in person but I got to see this in the theater's on a One Night Only event and was blown away. Now I've seen Janet on the ""Rhythm Nation Tour"" and Prince on his ""Purple Rain Tour"". This ranks up there with those. Beyonce is such a BIG star but she seems approachably and will talk to anyone. Her perfoming gets better each time I see her. Her band was INCREDIBLE also. All Females and will give any all Male band a run for their money. I'm buying this DVD tomorrow and will never sell it.",1195689600,4,507,4.08
3204536,3,B000WGZGNS,"I Saw this show in phoenix and when i left I was in awe! She looked amazing and she soundedgood but i noticed one thing in particular! I could not put my finger on it but then it hit me...""AIT I seen this before!""Thinking back it was from her first solo tour! For most of her older songs, she used the same dances and also she used the sqame back ground video. The stage was nothing to be proud of just a flat lit up stage with a few stairs. where was the special effects? Get this guys she still is useing the same dance that DC3 used for soliger! She added too many songs to her set list she kinda pushed her way through them...IN HER DEFENCE THOUGH i LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE HAD AN ALL GIRL BAND AND THE NEW DANCES WERE WELL PERFORMED!",1195603200,2,737,4.020408163265306
