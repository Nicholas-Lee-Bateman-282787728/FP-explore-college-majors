It's possible there's good content in there, but it's impossible to know since I couldn't play more than a few minutes of it.",1368057600,2,202,4.17948717948718

2081312,1,B0002D68VA,"Don't buy this unless you want to watch 2 hours of Bill Wilson promoting his own products. There is very little technical information presented. This video was produced in 1997 and is a transfer from videotape (a bad one at that). Looks like it was produced in a garage. Looks like Lenny Magill bought up a bunch of old videos, transferred them to DVD and is trying to milk more profits.
Again, don't buy if you're looking for information on how-to.
I'm returning mine.",1326412800,5,469,4.595238095238095

2081315,4,B0002D68VA,"Very interesting review of techniques to maximize your 1911.  Could use more 'how-to' detail, but gives a good look inside what can be done to tune your 1911.",1249689600,4,158,4.642857142857143
2081316,5,B0002D68VA,This is an outstanding instructional Video and I will recommended to all Glock owners. Lenny does a great job taking you through the weapon and shows how to take good weapon system and improve it with great parts. He will recommend those parts/accessories for your gun to be replaced or updated depending on your need or how often you shoot. A Must Have Video for all.,1231200000,12,368,4.590909090909091
