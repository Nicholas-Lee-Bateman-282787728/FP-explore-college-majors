8620205,5,B00G2JVFL6,Duane Eddy & Stephen Housden  ( of the Little River Band ) are 2 of my favorite guitarists. I could tell that Stephen was gobsmacked by being in the presence of the King of the TWANGY guitar. I just enjoyed Duane talk about his long life as a muso and the playing of tunes to illustrate his life and times in music. It also touches on the history of Rock 'N' Roll by one who was there when it took off in the mid 1950's. By the way they both play a little bit through out the interview. What fun for me!,1414195200,,503,3.9313725490196076
