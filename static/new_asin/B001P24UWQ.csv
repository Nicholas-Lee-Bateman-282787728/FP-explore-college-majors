3737102,5,B001P24UWQ,"This is a very solid sword primer for the beginner or advanced student. Dr. Yang goes into great detail on the differences between a Taiji sword and a Jian. The exercises included will work well, whether you are interested training Taiji or traditional northern style sword. His discussions on body mechanics alone make this DVD worth the price. Without proper use of the whole body, the straight sword would be a weak weapon, and he discusses this in detail.

The two person practice is very solid in that his intent is for the student to learn the sensitivity required for the straight sword. Once again, the included student teaching and correction is valuable to teachers as well as those new to the sword. If you want to learn solid basics and more advanced partner practice, this is the place to start. The DVD is almost 4 hours long and packed with good information. I have begun incorporating a lot of these drills with my own beginner students. A solid Product! A++",1251849600,2,974,4.695906432748538
3737103,5,B001P24UWQ,"Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has produced a very interesting and incredibly informative fundamental Kung Fu sword training DVD. The program is divided into 4 major sections:

I.  General Knowledge
  a) Different Kinds of Swords
  b) Distance/Length (of Swords)
  c) Sword Secret Hand Forms
  d) Sword Proverbs
II. Key Words and Techniques
III. Solo Practices
IV.  Matching Drills

In section ""I"" Dr. Yang explains the differences between various swords (and their dimensions) used in classical Chinese martial arts. Dr. Yang also demonstrates ""secret"" hand forms (basic sword movements/techniques), and lectures on the ""sword proverbs"" (a wonderfully obscure topic which adds to uniqueness of this DVD).

In section ""II"" Dr. Yang comprehensively explains and demonstrates 27 ""key words"" or basic northern style foundation sword techniques (utilized during the solo and partner techniques demonstrated in the next two sections).

In section ""III"" and ""IV"", more than a dozen solo drills and two person ""matching practice"" techniques are introduced and demonstrated. All of the solo and partner practices are explained and demonstrated by Dr. Yang and again by several of his students at various levels of skill. To further help viewers learn, Dr. Yang provides student correction as if an actual class is in progress.

On ""Sword Fundamental Training"" Dr. Yang has developed a comprehensive program for learning, understanding and practicing the basic theory, fundamental techniques, solo and partner drills for sword training. Although Dr. Yang maintains an upbeat, energetic (and even playful) attitude through out, this is a serious program for those interested in sword study. The solo and partner drills demonstrated are rigorous, so expect a physical (and mental) workout should you decide to give sword fundamental training a try.

According to Dr. Yang (and I believe him), mastering fundamental sword training should take approximately 10 years, assuming 6 to 8 hours of practice a day! Practice less, and it'll probably take 30 years! Fortunately for anyone interested in fundamental sword training - this excellent DVD will provide you with enough theory, technique and drills to keep you busy for a long time. If fundamental sword training is your interest, I highly recommend this DVD.",1251331200,14,2288,5.457386363636363
3737104,5,B001P24UWQ,"Another masterful title put out by YMAA. Dr. Yang is a wonderful instructor, and the dvd starts out basic enough even for those with no prior experience picking up a sword. The DVD is great to watch and practice with a partner as well. The exercises he describes and demonstrates build a great foundation for anyone looking to get into sword fighting.

Also really great is the discussions for the chapters of history and uses of the swords he trains with.",1251331200,7,456,4.62962962962963
3737105,5,B001P24UWQ,"I have been a martial artist since 1966.  I hold a black belt (5th dan) in a martial art called Kenpo.  I have trained with Chinese saber and samurai sword since the early 80's.  I find Dr. Yang's DVD to be outstanding.  His instruction is very detailed, thorough, and easy to follow. His presentation is masterful, demonstrating each move with precision, it felt like he was in the room providing individual instruction.  The solo exercises not only help improve sword technique but they strengthen the hand, wrist, and forearm as well. He also teaches two person drills which can easily be applied with a partner. In addition, he provides a thorough discussion on the history of various swords which I found very interesting....Loved it.",1248652800,9,739,4.92741935483871
3737106,5,B001P24UWQ,"I enjoyed the DVD very much, as it gives broad coverage to the fundamentals of the Sword.  Dr. Yang is an instructor of great experience and you can really tell it in this seminar-style DVD.  For martial artists who live far from urban centers, this DVD provides a route to expanding one's sphere of knowledge that would otherwise be unavailable.",1391904000,,346,4.75
3737107,5,B001P24UWQ,"I loved the background information that dr. Yang gave on the swords, it is very good for anyone who wants to improve their understanding and skill with swords in general or to get a start but you still would want to get personal instructions.

3737109,5,B001P24UWQ,"On this DVD, Dr. Yang Jwing Ming introduces the beginner to basics of the Chinese sword. The viewer is presented with a brief overview of a few different types of (mostly) straight double edged swords (jian, ,) the different sizes, and how each was used historically. He covers a short number of styles using the Northern and Southern swords, describing the intricacies of both the lighter and the heavier model, the various regions of the blade, as well as the proper method for handling and inspecting a sword.

The only down side that I could think of was the introduction, which consisted of a compilation of various clips and segments taken from different sections of the DVD. While it did give a quick overview of what was in store, I found this part somewhat redundant, and feel that it could have been left out in favor of a more historical overview. With that (very) minor irk out of the way, its on to the positives.

The GENERAL KNOWLEDGE section is filled with interesting facts and pointers when handling a Chinese sword. The information presented here covers a bit of history, discusses the differences between the long and heavy two-handed sword, and the lighter nimbler sword. Covered, are the stylistic differences between the internal and external styles (such as principles of sticking,) the various surface areas of the blade such as blocking surface, cutting surface, and the different positions of the hand guard, and the various Chinese folk sayings related to the handling of the sword.

The TECHNIQUE section deals with key terminology, basic concepts, and discussion of the general styles from which the techniques were taken and demonstrated. Since this DVD is only meant to be a brief introduction, various sword techniques were compiled from different styles for the sake of general familiarization with the sword as a weapon. As such, 26 stylistically varying techniques are presented for conditioning and practice. The movements, while simple in concept, can be quite arduous when performed repeatedly, and will provide a considerable work out.

The SOLO PRACTICE portion lists various drills performed with the sword, ranging from defensive to offensive. Dr. Yang asks several students to demonstrate which is a big plus, since different body types from different angles offer a better understanding of the physical movements to the viewer. The MATCHING PRACTICE section helps take the SOLO PRACTICE section further, by showing how the SOLO PRACTICE techniques are applied in a two person drill. Again, the students performing from different angles are a big plus, and help clearly demonstrate the proper movement and application of the demonstrated technique.

Overall, this is a great product which offers the complete beginner a comprehensive glimpse into the Chinese straight sword techniques and training, and will help in establishing a solid foundation for further hands-on training.",1280534400,,2922,5.208510638297873
3737110,5,B001P24UWQ,"I already own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SABER-Fundamental-Training-YMAA-Dr-Yang/dp/B001H7RMCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SABER Fundamental Training (YMAA) Dr. Yang</a>&nbsp;and have been working with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taiji-Saber-Classical-Yang-Style/dp/B0011Z1SY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taiji Saber Classical Yang Style</a>&nbsp;dvds. (Traditionally, taiji students begin with the saber, then move to the sword.) As a result, I was initially concerned that a lot of the material on this dvd would be a re-hash of what was on the other discs. I was very pleasantly surprised, however, to find that this is not the case. That's not to say that there is no overlap--there is some--but there was much new information here and even some of the same techniques have subtle differences when using a straight sword vs. the saber.

As with the Saber Fundamental Training, do not expect to find full-blown sword forms on this disc. Instead, you will find here the fundamental building blocks from which the kung fu and taiji sword forms are composed. Getting these basics down will dramatically improve your ability to pick up new sword forms quickly and--more important--correctly. I've found it far easier to learn the full forms after studying these foundational elements.

If you have any interest in straight sword forms, this disc is a must-have!",1271808000,6,1461,6.448979591836735
3737111,5,B001P24UWQ,"As many other reviewers have pointed out, this DVD addresses all the basic techniques and functions of the Chinese straight sword, otherwise known as a two-edged sword, gim, jian, or ch'ian.  As a nearly fifteen-year practitioner of traditional Chinese martial arts, I personally know several two-edge sword forms including Yang tai chi sword.  Even with my background, I found this DVD to be filled with useful information and details on specific techniques that were not known to me prior to watching this training video.  Especially interesting is the background information presented about the weapon and the discussion of northern vs. southern styles of swords.  Dr. Yang even discusses how to choose a weapon that is better suited to the practitioners needs, depending on style or usage and also proper handling to ensure protection against oxidation and tarnish.  This is all value added in addition to the techniques presented.

The only negative aspect of the DVD is one that is not really negative enough to warrant not recommending this training DVD to any students.  After each technique is explained, particularly in the single and partner practice, four of Dr. Yang's students demonstrate the technique in several standing and moving positions.  Occasionally Dr. Yang will correct the students so the viewer can see proper vs. improper technique.  Considering that over forty techniques and practices are presented, that makes for a long video (220 minutes to be exact).  I think that just one student demonstration would be sufficient.",1269907200,3,1550,5.289795918367347
3737112,5,B001P24UWQ,"This video is great for anyone who is interested in the Tai Chi sword, for Tai Chi exercise training to application in combat. Dr Ming brushes over many valuable points on angle's and movement that you don't find in many other places, let alone books and DVD's. He is a true master, that convincingly wants to improve the world of martial arts through his lessons for the home studies of every day martial artists, and casual viewer with a spark of curiosity for eastern history and concepts of Chi. Whatever your reasons may be this, DVD is sure to lean you in the right direction in a way of the edge, and do nothing but improve your understanding or refresh your memory with awesome knowledge that isn't found everywhere.",1265846400,,724,4.62015503875969
3737113,5,B001P24UWQ,"My sword background is primarily with Japanese and Korean sword work, so I found Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's DVD ""Sword Fundamental Training: Solo Drills and Matching Practice"" different from what I'm familiar with, but very interesting and very well done for an instructional DVD.

I've been very impressed with Dr. Yang's DVDs on Chin Na, especially since my primary art of Hapkido also consists of many joint lock and pressure point techniques.  So I wanted to learn more of the sword fundamentals from the Chinese arts that Dr. Yang teaches.  This is a very good DVD to introduce those concepts and training methods.

The DVD is divided into six main chapters:  Intro, General Knowledge, Techniques, Solo Practice, Matching Practice, and the Conclusion.  These six main chapters are divided into more than 60 chapters to help you skip to the section you want to review and study.  The entire program is a little over three and a half hours long, so you will want to take notes and skip back to the sections as you progress.  There are subtitles that go along with Dr. Yang's instruction.  I don't think they are necessary, but having them there does not hurt.  They do not match the exact words of Dr. Yang, but convey the general concepts he discusses.

The first portion of the DVD focuses on information and history of the sword.  It was very interesting and informative.  It's a lecture on the sword that includes Chinese proverbs on the sword.  This portion was very interesting if you are interested in all things martial as I am.  Dr. Yang then teaches 27 fundamental techniques with the sword.  The instruction is very clear, and Dr. Yang brings out students to assist him in showing applications of the techniques.  So many DVDs would just show the movement once or twice and move on to the next.  Dr. Yang provides so much more, and it is really refreshing to see an instructor who goes above and beyond while teaching.

The next portion of the program entails the solo practice drills.  There is a lot to learn and practice here.  The Chinese movements are different from the Japanese and Korean I'm used to, and I enjoyed learning some different ways to use the long blade, even if some of the movements seemed awkward due to being foreign to me.  At times Dr. Yang has students perform the solo drills, so you get to see different variations of solo practice.

The final section before the conclusion is the matching practice with a partner.  There were ten different matching drills and again, Dr. Yang gives so much while teaching.  Going slow, watching the DVD, and working with a partner, and you can definitely learn a lot from this program.  Again, Dr. Yang's students demonstrate live practice with the drills Dr. Yang teaches.  Watching them illustrates how you can practice.

I really enjoy Dr. Yang's instruction and explanations.  He has such a tremendous amount of knowledge and I feel we are fortunate to have access to that knowledge through the books and DVDs he has authored and produced.  Even with such knowledge and the traditional background, he still interjects humor and modern American culture, such as near the end when he says it takes a long time to become a Jedi.

Another thing that really impressed me, and I've mentioned it already, is the amount of information Dr. Yang provides on this DVD.  I recently checked out a three-volume set on self-defense from my local library.  Each DVD was thirty minutes long.  I thought to myself, why didn't they put all of this on one DVD?  They wanted to make more money, that's why.  This DVD is over three and a half hours long.  If that other company had produced it, it would have been released as seven DVDs.  It is just one more reason I really respect Dr. Yang and YMAA.

The DVD also contains the standard YMAA Extras: About YMAA, Catalog, Video Previews, and DVD Credits.

This is an excellent introduction to Chinese sword.  It provides history and information about the sword and enough instruction on techniques to provide many hours of learning and practice.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn or know more about Chinese sword techniques.

3737114,4,B001P24UWQ,"I have been studying Taekwondo for about two years and along with the regular training we also have weapons - katana included. The way of using the sword described in this video, therefore, is completely new to me. This was something both exciting and frustrating because every once in a while, especially when tired, I would found myself holding and swaying the sword the ""Korean"" way.

Regardless of my frustration, the pace and level of teaching is for the very beginner. The instructor, with a very ""fatherly"" tone, brings the students to an intermediate level (honestly, this claim comes from the box rather than myself!). I can tell, though, that I can now follow along the DVD quite well, now!

As other people who have reviewed the DVD have said, the material is fantastic. I found the Introductory material on Swords to be VERY interesting!

Why four stars? There are two things that I found very distracting: 1) there is only 1 camera and therefore the point of view is fixed; 2) there are subtitles. These are there not becuase the instructor speaks Chinese but because he speaks English with an accent. Honestly, after about a minute, I got used to the accent and I had no problem whatsover understading him. I realized, however, that the subtitles and the instructor were not saying always the same thing. Now, THAT is distructing! I found myself trying to read rather than listen to him, or the other way... and was more curious about how different they were rather than learning the material.

Besides this, get the DVD and a sword (a friend wouldn't hurt either) and have fun. This is a good place to start to lay down the foundation for sword training!",1254787200,6,1669,4.725085910652921
3737115,5,B001P24UWQ,"This is really excellent for the student who has already learned one or more Chinese sword forms and who wants to know more about the actual applications and practices.
