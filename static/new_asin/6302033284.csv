7819913,5,6302033284,"This nice little collection has three of Laurel & Hardy`s best short talking films. Towed In A Hole, Busy Bodies, and The Music Box.
In their short films, L&H would take one single idea or situation and milk it for every last possible laugh. Timing the gags in
such a way as to give you just enough time to recover from the last one before springing the next for non-stop laughs.
In Towed in a Hole the boys intend to expand their fish business by buying an old boat and catching their own fish. But first the
boat has to be restored. Having Ollie try to fix a boat is just asking for trouble. Having Stan help is guaranteed disaster.
Busy Bodies has the boys working in a lumber yard. There are some really great gags in this one. If you have never seen anyone
get a shave with a wood plane, or saw a model T Ford in half you have to see this film.
The Music Box is one of their very best. You will laugh until your sides hurt watching the boys try to deliver a piano using
true L&H knowhow, logic, and tenacity.",1261872000,,1013,4.147208121827411

7819915,5,6302033284,"When I was a kid, you could often find Laurel & Hardy films on TV. Maybe I just don't know where to look, but I never see them there anymore. That's a real shame, because these guys were a wonderful, pioneering comedy team. Their work is timeless.
This video includes three great short films. In ""Towed In A Hole"", the boys figure they can make more money from their fish-peddling business by catching their own fish. Problems arise when they buy an old boat and try to fix it up themselves. ""Busy Bodies"" finds our heroes working in a sawmill and spending most of their time trying to fix their own screwups. ""The Music Box"" is a genuine classic and an Oscar winner. The fun starts when Stan & Ollie, now working as delivery men (check out the horse-drawn delivery wagon) must deliver a piano to a house at the top of a lengthy flight of stairs (131 steps). The stairway really exists in an L.A. suburb and much of the film was shot on location. The idea for this flick was pure inspiration.
Laurel & Hardy put a lot of classic comedy on film. This is your chance to own  some great examples of their work for a very modest price. If you like classic comedy, or if you've never seen these guys at work, this is a great place to start. Get a copy  wherever or whenever the opportunity arises. It's well worth it. Very highly recommended.",988416000,20,1337,4.365461847389558
