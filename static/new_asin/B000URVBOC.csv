If you like to watch Birdemic quality acting, special effects as done by toddlers with an HP 800, and some softcore porn that could turn off even the most prolific jackers. If you are looking for a night of fun riffing with friends, this stinker is the perfect companion.",1463616000,,312,4.6909090909090905

8214565,5,B000URVBOC,"To understand what makes this movie great you need to understand how it got made...

The two stars of the film are actually recovering heroine addicts living together in a studio apartment in New Jersey. The two suddenly came into some money when they're mutual drug dealer came by the house to peddle his wares and ended up having a massive heart attack, leaving the two with the $2,300 he had in his pocket at the time.

The two suddenly had delusions of grandeur regarding what they could accomplish with the $2,300 to turn their lives around. They could pay their overdue bills, pay the rent, get the heat turned back on, and even get some clean clothes to help them get a job!... In the end they both just decided to make a movie.

V World Matrix is the culmination of their efforts. Written by the two as they were coming off the high from their dead dealer's stash and complete with special effects drawn up in MS Paint this film has everything you never wanted. Like a prolonged and uncomfortable sex scene between the two stars and two actual prostitutes they happened to cast right off the street who were so embarrassed to be involved with this project that they wouldn't take off their masks.

This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. Not the worst film, I wouldn't even call this a film. This is the worst ""thing"" I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Do yourself a favor and see this movie... just don't pay for it.",1420502400,5,1438,4.4356060606060606

8214567,1,B000URVBOC,"I am so sorry that I had not heeded the warning of the other reviews. I am a Christian. This movie went in the garbage can after I gave it a chance to the bitter end.
I do not even want to return it for a refund, because I would be afraid of perpetuating this nightmare by allowing a copy of it to still be in circulation.

The acting is fifth rate. The cinematography is something I would have expected from my high school students, if this were still the year 1980. The story line could have been stronger. The special effects look like they were done before the internet was even invented. Some of the graphic porn like scenes are violent and offensive toward both sexes for the typical stereotypes they perpetrate for both the victim and the game player.",1302480000,,758,4.375886524822695
8214568,1,B000URVBOC,Stuck with a poor grade B movie. Only bought it for the 3D which I could not get to play on my DVD. Rather high price for the poor quality and content. Don't reccomend this one.,1293840000,,177,3.9444444444444446
8214569,2,B000URVBOC,"Quality of the film left a lot to be desired.  However, I realize this is out of the seller's control.  The film arrived in a timely manner and in New condition.  Sorry for late submission of feedback.",1233964800,,201,4.378378378378378

8214571,1,B000URVBOC,"This is a warning: Avoid. It's not Sci-Fi 3D, it's soft core porn. I wish I had read Brad's review but I had taken the risk and ordered it by then. It doesn't belong with those other 3d classics and way too expensive.
After years of buying from Amazon, this has been the only Turkey.",1221177600,15,283,4.163636363636364

With video technology being what it is today, I was excited at the prospect of seeing programs in ""Real 3-D"".  I brought several pairs of 3D glasses from different sources and found the results to be very disappointing. Viewing without the glasses produces a big blur, but with the glasss, the blur is somewhat still there and if you use your imagination slightly, you think you might see a little bit of 3-D.  I tried the same DVD on two sets and found the results to be the same on each one - very bad.  I've tried other titles of 3-D DVD and found all of them to be a giant step backward in terms of producing an enjoyable image.  I think Amazon.com should provide a warning on such DVD's to say the results of your veiwing experience may be less than desirable.  I was not aware that a system was needed to get the full benefit of this kind or other type of 3-D DVD's.  That info was not provided in the description of the product.  There was also no mention that regular 3-D type glasses would not work and that a totally dark room was also needed which had been mentioned by other reviewers.  I saw the new 3-D TV Systems in a store demonstration this past weekend and that was real 3-D.",1220572800,17,1400,4.852941176470588
