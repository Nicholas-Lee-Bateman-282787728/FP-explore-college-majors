7980971,5,B000089R0Y,"Bob the builder is a great video for any age.  My kids loved them at age 2, and loved them at age 5 (may be a little boring for older kids though).  Great for teaching teamwork and politeness.  All-around wholesome!",1222300800,,215,4.325
7980972,1,B000089R0Y,the first copy I ordered would only play in French. Amazon took it back and sent another that also only played in French. They aren't able to send another since it is a widespread problem.,1140134400,,188,4.4
7980973,4,B000089R0Y,"Just to update my previous review.  This past weekend I received a new version of the Building Friendships DVD from HIT Entertainment.  The new version has English as the default language and all the commericials that were at the beginning of the previous DVD have been moved to the end.
An excellent version of Building Friendships.",1065484800,6,333,4.928571428571429
7980974,4,B000089R0Y,"My 4 year old loved seeing the new episodes on this DVD.  New characters (Trix, Molly) were a nice surprise.
A couple complaints though:  Default language on the DVD is French!  Each time we play it we have to first go into the menu to switch to English.  Maybe I got the wrong version of the DVD?  And there is no easy way to get right to the Bob the Builder episodes... we have to sit through the Wiggles and other preview stuff first.",1055203200,5,437,4.154761904761905
