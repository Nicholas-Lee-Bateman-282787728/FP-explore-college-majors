8065373,5,B0009PW4BE,"This was a televised ""after school special,"" so for those expecting a ""Hollywood"" type film you should adjust your expectations. It was a treat to see a young Kidman performing. She really is a great actress, (although I think she has a most difficult time with an American accent in her current films).

Some of the lower ratings here seem due to the expectation of a high quality, high budget film - which this is not. It is a made for t.v. program, and if you view it with that in mind it is very enjoyable. It was nice to see a healthy looking young Nicole Kidman acting the part of a High School athlete that is struggling with the training demands placed on her by an over-zealous, (but loving) father. All of the actors do a fine job here, and the script is enjoyable for what it was. Give it a look - at the very least watching Nicole Kidman act at such a young age is worth the watch.",1469318400,,893,4.222222222222222

8065378,4,B0009PW4BE,"I borrowed this movie from a friend simply because I wanted to see how  Nicole Kidman looked and acted at the beginning of her career. As you might imagine, she was stunning even then and was a fine little actress.

I enjoyed her performance as Carol, as well as the second lead, a young girl named Angie, but the plot was too simple for my tastes. It's the story of a kind, generous high-school girl from a nice, normal family who befriends the troubled new, spike-haired girl in her school.

The new friends end up helping each other, indirectly, because Kidman's father is pushing her to become a huge track star. She has the natural ability but is uncertain about what she wants to be. Angie is a talented dancer, so Kidman experiments with dancing, much to the dismay of her father.

This movie is a coming-of-age story with an unresolved ending that ends rather abruptly. For that reason and because it lacks bursts of humor that might have redeemed it, I'm giving this one four stars.

Endnote: I found it interesting that this film was originally intended as part of a larger miniseries and is one of Kidman's earliest roles.

8065379,4,B0009PW4BE,"I rated this four stars because Nicole Kidman did an excellent job with her role.  She is very sweet by playing a good friend to someone who doesn't deserve to be an outcast.  But the story is familiar and predictable, with sparse humor, so I almost gave a three star rating.  The movie isn't very long - only about an hour.

Nicole plays Carol, a teenager who is pushed by her father to be a great runner.  He is trying to live his dreams through her.  Her parents are strict with homework and curfews.  She meets a girl at school who comes from the opposite situation; this girl's father often doesn't even know or care where his daughter has gone.  This girl, Angie, looks different from others in the school - she has dyed, spiked, short hair.  Carol's family is concerned about this new friendship.

The dilemma for Carol arises when she decides to make a choice on her own what to pursue - to be the best runner at the expense of other enjoyments or to live a more well-rounded life with the realization that could mean she will not be the best.

I would rate this movie PG.  There were no drugs, sex, or language problems that I heard.  Sometimes the australian accent was a bit difficult to dicipher.  If I had turned up the volume it may have helped.  The main characters do respectfully defy (I know it sounds like an oxymoron) authority figures at certain times in the movie.  Defying might be too strong a word - but I will leave it in for concerned parents.  It is primarily a classic teenager struggle to define him/herself without alienating too much the loved parents and coaches who may have different dreams.  It is secondarily a story of friendship between two diverse girls when one is ready for a change.  It comes down to Carol's choice in both matters.",1168214400,22,1775,4.473520249221184
