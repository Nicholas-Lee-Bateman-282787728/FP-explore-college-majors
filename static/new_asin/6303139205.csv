7838775,1,6303139205,I'm just curious... Think they'll proof the final draft of the cover before they approve it? Or is it actually going out like this?,1352073600,,131,4.5
7838776,3,6303139205,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the second series of many ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around 1999 that ran around an hour long.  Hogan host his video from his home in Florida & reflects on his various moments throughout his WCW career along with also showing off his custom painted nWo speedboat.  His debut against Ric Flair for the WCW Title at Bash At The Beach '94 is covered before going into the downfall of his relationship with Jimmy Hart.  His transformation in Hollywood Hogan at the Bash At The Beach '96 followed by the nWo's dominance along with winning the World Title at Hog Wild was highlighted before going into losing & regaining the WCW Title from Lex Luger in 97, his feud with Sting was shown before going into the split of the nWo & losing the title to Goldberg, his celebrity tag matches against Diamond Dallas Page are shown before talking about his ""Hulk Hogan For President"" angle leading up to the infamous ""Fingerpoke Of Doom"" & his victory over Ric Flair at SuperBrawl.

Hulk Hogan had been the main event guy in WCW for 5 years up to this point so it's not possible to cover everything he did within an hour so thankfully some feuds were left forgotten (everything in his first two years past the debut match with Flair & Jimmy Hart turning on him) but some moments were also heavily forgotten such as his feuds against Randy Savage & Roddy Piper weren't mentioned at all.  A bunch of the matches highlighted on here have sense been released onto DVD sets that WWE have put out in regards to Hogan & WCW so you aren't really missing anything on this VHS so unless your a hardcore WCW/Hollywood Hogan fan, this is a tape that you can pass on.",1300060800,2,1793,4.454268292682927

7838778,5,6303139205,"I missed watching Dinosaucers for years after they took it off the air in the 80's.  Make no mistake, this IS the 1980's show, despite the year in the title.  The show was fun, with good characters and better than average writing.  The voice acting sometimes left a little to be desired, but most cartoons of the era had worse voice acting (*cough* M.A.S.K. *cough*).  Overall, it's watchable again and again.  Just like I remembered.  The only thing that could make this better would be if it were on DVD!",1118966400,3,506,4.566666666666666

7838781,5,6303139205,"Hulk Hogan is the greatest wrestler ever.  This movie is great, but it focuses on basicly nWo matches.  If you love wrestling and Hulk Hogan you should defenitly buy this movie.  Also you should get wrestlemania III,it  has a good match with Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant. And remember; with  the training, the prayers, and the vitamins, you too can be like the  Hulkster!",945216000,,373,4.661538461538462

Hogan joins the NWO. Hogan and the NWO rain a path of  terror accross the wrestling world that reinvented wrestling as we know it.  THis is a great stocking stuffer as well",944352000,4,339,4.28125
