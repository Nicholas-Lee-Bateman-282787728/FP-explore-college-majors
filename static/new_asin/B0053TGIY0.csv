The man should literally be at Carnegie Hall.  He is the finest pianist I've ever heard.  Particularly on the opening segment, it was as if light were pulsating from him, the piano, and the universe itself.  I've never heard such pieces come alive like that.  Life and love were pouring through the keys and into all of us.  An absolutely glorious artist!!!!!",1338249600,,399,4.984848484848484
