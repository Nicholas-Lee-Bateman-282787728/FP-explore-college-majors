7481177,5,B016YPHWOG,"This is truly a well-written, directed and enjoyable film - so much so that I practically forgot I was having to read the subtitles! You will undoubtedly find yourself saying, ""Sure! That's exactly the way things would happen!"" A mother's love is divided between the people she has faithfully served for so many years and her own daughter who has once again ""found"" her mother, when she ""needs"" her for all the wrong reasons.",1451865600,,425,4.756756756756757

It is very good
And will help you see the world better",1449100800,,71,3.8
7481181,4,B016YPHWOG,"I totally enjoyed this film -- though the ending was kind of a let down.  I was left wondering how in the world Val was going to support her daughter and her grandson without a job.  Up to that point I thought the movie was excellent, and the actions of Val's employer Dona Barbara were so, so, so true to life.  I have met many individuals who are as passive-aggressively petty as Dona Barbara, and it was gratifying to see that whomever wrote this screenplay has met a few as well.  A very worthwhile film, and Val was simply hilarious at times.

A mash up I would love to see:  self-effacing Val working alongside Wanda Sykes' brash maid character from Chris Rock's Down to Earth.  Wanda Sykes' maid would eat Val alive for breakfast, and it would be a hilarious pairing.",1499040000,,774,4.446808510638298
7481182,5,B016YPHWOG,"I was raised by a latin housekeeper who lived with us for 20 yrs. Speaking only spanish to me, I became fluent at a very young age. My family teased me as the, spanish baby. She would send most of her salary to her country to support her own kids, who she hadn't seen in years! She was with me more than my own mom,I loved and adored her. The movie brought back great memories for me. Great acting all around.",1493337600,5,409,4.061728395061729

7481184,5,B016YPHWOG,This movie perfectly describes the modern Brazilian society talking about destiny and opportunities. . The daughter of an housemaid highlights the absurdity of the relationship between employers and housemaids and decides to challenge it. It's a beautiful movie with excellent actors and I really LOVED it - I am so glad it was included in my Prime Membership!,1492041600,3,360,5.224137931034483
7481185,5,B016YPHWOG,"What a pleasant surprise! If you're looking for a fast-paced film, this is most likely not for you.  To many, it will feel like little happens and it is far too long, especially at a slow pace.  However, one can see the depth in the story through the pace and even the moments that the camera stays on characters, especially Val, while she's clearly just thinking.  The acting was good but Val is superb! I cannot wait to find other pieces where she's shown her talent.  The film is well worth the time!",1489536000,3,503,4.376344086021505

7481192,3,B016YPHWOG,It definitely beats reruns on TV but nothing to write home about.  At times we thought we were watching reality TV with no real plot.  I suspect it was intended to be a television show but the decision was made to turn it into a movie instead.,1485820800,,243,4.148936170212766

Madame Cas&eacute;'s sultry embracing of her role is endearing. She's my mother, my aunt, my neighbor.

7481223,3,B016YPHWOG,"A slow-moving story with strong writing and acting.  If you like subtlety, rather than action, you might like this film.  A nice little character study about class differences.",1476316800,,176,5.25

7481226,3,B016YPHWOG,Regina Case was the only draw in this movie. All other characters were unappealing in one way or another. The story dragged quite a bit and the dialogue was uninspiring.,1474848000,,169,4.666666666666667
7481227,4,B016YPHWOG,"I'd actually rate this a 3.5.  Crossing class lines is always tricky business (as the grandchild of a housekeeper, I know first hand).  Us and them and respect the boundaries.

As I picked up where I left off I said I was determined to finish this movie leaving an open mind to do so and I'm glad I did. I will watch this one again at some point so I can get more out of it as I always do. I would recommend this movie to others and tell them to give it a chance even if they don't watch it all at once as I did. I gave it five stars because of the way it ended.",1471910400,,445,3.4158415841584158

7481238,4,B016YPHWOG,"An insightful exposition of ""upstairs, downstairs"" relations in Latin America--and not only. Having been raised in an upper middle class household in 1950s Greece (two maids, a live-in French governess, a full-time gardener), I have personal experience with the internal dynamics depicted in this movie. A ""second mother"" may not often receive the degree of affection shown here by the teenage children (by their pre-teens, typically most of them have fully internalized the class divide and behave accordingly), nor does she often possess the forceful personality of Regina Cas' character. But in various forms and degrees of influence she still exists. The acting and direction in this movie are not of the highest quality and certain scenes appeared to me to lack authenticity. Still, it is a movie that is very much worth watching--if for no other reason, because it is often quite entertaining.",1470960000,,899,5.25

7481242,4,B016YPHWOG, Second chances are waiting if we seize them we can discover more about life and ourselves and those that we may have unintentionally but needfully neglected along the way.,1470009600,,172,4.931034482758621

7481247,4,B016YPHWOG,"This is a quiet but emotionally powerful movie, very similar to the Chilean movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Maid/dp/B003DW64YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Maid</a>. (In my opinion The Maid is just slightly better, but both are wonderful.) It deals with the relationship of a middle-aged maid and her wealthy employers, and the change in those relationships that develops after her grown daughter comes to stay with them.  The actors are top-notch, and the central character easily wins your heart. Another excellent movie with a similar theme is the Argentine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-In-Maid/dp/B0013URS2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live-In Maid</a>.

7481253,4,B016YPHWOG,"This is an excellent movie about social class, privilege, servitude, family structures, education, and, also, attitudes.

Look around you and you will see this going on near you if not in your own home. The nannies raising other people's children for the parents who work too hard or have too little time.

The movie starts out with the house maid / family caretaker watching over a cute little boy asking, ""who did you just say that you loved?"" The next scene, the boy is a teenager so it is obvious that many years have passed and when the maid says that Jessica wants to visit, the employers don't even know, remember, or care that their devoted maid has a daughter of her own.

The daughter comes because she's applying to the university there and her mother's employers appear to be shocked at the audacity of this girl thinking she can pass the exams to get accepted to the school. The daughter is a new thinker and doesn't understand the mother's lower caste system and even likens it to India.  Turns out, the maid's daughter passes the entrance exams and the privileged son doesn't.

The story has developed the characters very well that you can fully understand by their body language and the English subtitles. It twists a little bit here and there so that it isn't totally predictable.

It was a very good movie.

It was free on Amazon Prime and it is one of the better foreign films I've seen on Amazon Prime.

7481256,4,B016YPHWOG,"This is a very solid drama.  The only thing light hearted about it was the maids optimism.  Other than that is was about the class system in Brazil, and a daughter who is does not believe in the class system at all; trying to live in her mother's employer's home.

While she raises their only son  and substitutes for his conceited socialite mother and dysfunctional burnt-out ex-artist father, she carefully preserves the illusion of PC equality masking the real distance between the family's bossing their help and her own perception of her station. Things come to a crisis when her estranged daughter, abandoned by her as a baby but supported by Val all along, comes to Sao Paulo to enroll in a exclusive school of architecture. Val's employers offer (PC) to give the girl room and board until she settles, but the young woman cannot accept the servility of her mother and dares to act as the owners' equal. The director maneuvers among three approaches - a sitcom, a harsh social comment, and a tearjerker. This results in a competent but pretty shallow movie. The four stars belong to the excellent performance of Regina Case as Val and a very good match in Camila Mrdila as her daughter. All in all, quite enjoyable but no cigar.",1467072000,,1071,4.758064516129032

The TRIX Home espresso set as Val's gift was symbolic to me on a few different levels.

Val reminded me of my older generation relatives- expressions and all.

7481408,4,B016YPHWOG,"This is billed as a comedy and stars  Regina Cas&eacute; as the maid to a rich family in Sao Paulo. She has raised the families son and takes care of everything for them from walking the dog, making the meals to trimming the hedge. Then her estranged daughter asks to come and stay and she is overjoyed having been separated for ten years.

However, her daughter is a modern free thinker and just does not get the social divide that separates her and her mother from these rich folk and the inevitable clashes start from the get go.

Now as a film on social commentary this is all straight forward and we don't really need to be told that money buys privilege. Whilst as a character piece it works a lot better with the various players establishing where they sit in the hierarchy of life and how that will affect those around them. It is a gentle film, not really a comedy, and will not tax you too much. Its original Portuguese title is ""Que Horas Ela Volta?"". Some have hailed this as a master piece and others have said it is pointless in that it brings nothing new. I found it to be enjoyable but not one I would rush out and buy  I rented this  but its one that passes the time very agreeably and is far from being the land mark some have hailed it to be but is also far from being a lamentable waste of time, so 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 as I did enjoy it.",1453593600,3,1363,4.167300380228137

7481412,4,B016YPHWOG,"In a summer swarmed with silver-screen dinosaurs, hot pursuits and earthquakes, director Anna Muylaerts The Second Mother is a pleasant reminder that films don't need huge budgets to be huge crowd-pleasers. One could even argue that the films inflated production costs may serve as detriments to their overall entertainment factor: characters get overwhelmed by special effects, a coherent plot takes second place to a constant assault on the senses, and dumbed-down dialogue seems pasted-in to transition one vapid sequence to the next. The majority of it set within the confines of a privileged So Paulo family household, The Second Mother mesmerizes with piercing gestures, simmering resentments and astute characterizations, and does so much more powerfully  and with a longer-lasting effect  than any given chase from, say, The Transporter Refueled.

The film introduces us to Val (Brazilian soap opera and film star Regina Cas), a hardened maid, going about her chores. Her ambiguous role is established within minutes: she is a laborer, ready to serve at the matriarchs, Brbaras (Karine Teles), every whim, a second mother to her privileged son Fabinho (Michel Joelsas), and a nurse to Brbaras ailing  or perhaps just severely depressed  husband Carlos (Loureno Mutarelli)On top of that, Val has a daughter of her own, Jssica (Camila Mrdila), whom she hasn't seen for over ten years.

Brbara, an imperious fashion mogul, is too busy to pay proper attention to her family, which has led to her husbands dreary isolation. Carlos is a sad, broken man, whose inheritance is  somewhat-surreptitiously  the reason behind the familys wealth (Everybody dances, but Im the DJ, he proclaims sadly at one point), and who, long ago, had dreams of being an artist. His paintings are now confined to the garage; some hang on the walls, as lifeless and forgotten as the man who once painted them. Fabinho, the son, is equally lost, his alienation bringing him almost disturbingly close to Val, who cuddles him to sleep, stroking his hair while singing sweet lullabies.

Val is a slave on one hand, but an essential part of the family on the other. Life in this film unfolds from her perspective, represented by a reoccurring shot from inside the kitchen, with only a fraction of the living room visible. The family eats their dinners in silence, each immersed in his or her cellphone (ah, upper-class bliss!).

One evening, Jssica calls and asks Val if she can come stay with her, while she studies to apply to a university. Val is utterly delighted; upon asking Brbara, Vals excitement is met with a tight-lipped of course!, and even an oh-so-gracious offer to pay for a mattress, to stuff inside Vals five-foot closet of a room, already dwarfed by the enormity of the house.

When she finds out she has to stay at her moms bosss abode, Jssica is appalled, Youre taking me to someone elses home. But the family is impressed by how much of an erudite Jssica is, and by her ambitions as an architect. They show her around the house, Val trailing behind, turning on the pool lights. Jssica discovers the beautiful guest room and brashly invites herself to stay there. In a perfectly-pitched sequence, the creepily enamored Carlos quickly caves in, leaving Brbara no choice but to reluctantly oblige.

Jssicas arrival leads to a rapid succession of unraveling developments: Val is torn between being a good mother to her daughter and the loyalty to her second family; Carlos temporarily rediscovers his former self, albeit in an awkward, humiliating manner; Brbara resents Jssica and has to eventually reevaluate her life; and Fabinho has to grow up and overcome his Oedipal tendencies. As for JssicaJssica is a symbol of hope, of an eager, educated generation that just may eventually bring an end to those societal discrepancies and injustices, still so prevalent today.

If all the intrigue sounds scandalous and soap-opera-ish, it sometimes verges dangerously to being so, but Muylaerts assertive, deft directorial touch ensures the film largely stays within the realms of sincerity. The dramatic, at times lightly-comedic, tone, is well-sustained in keenly observed scenes, such as Vals thoughtful birthday gift to Brbara, promptly dismissed, but touchingly, though predictably (at least in my desensitized-by-films mind) reappearing later.

Another standout scene shows Val accidentally oversleeping, and Jssica taking it into her own hands to make breakfast and sit at the masters table. When Val dashes out, apologetic and panicking, Brbara harshly scolds her and storms off. Val yells at her daughter for overstepping boundaries; Jssica nonchalantly finishes her breakfast. Soon after, Fabinho comes in, and sits at the table, and Val kisses him, and strokes his hair lovingly, and makes him breakfast.

Muylaert chose a naturalistic approach, letting the camera linger to catch the little nuances in the performances. There are images that stick: Carlos, left alone in the shadows, in front of his unwanted painting; Val, and then Brbara  the two mothers  comforting Fabinho, one by one in the bedroom; drenched Val, running after her fed-up daughter in the rain

With traces of Sebastin Silvas The Maid, The Second Mother does flirt with excessive sentimentality at points (especially towards the end), and remains a bit too slight to be labeled a masterpiece, but its an acute study of class and family bonds, with a marvelous central performance. While its a pleasure that films like that are still produced, distributed internationally and recognized at festivals, its a pity that contemporary audiences will surely be turned off by The Second Mothers modest scale and subtitles, for theyll be missing a true little gem. Make time for The Second Mother. Its not an impossible mission, after all.",1453334400,5,5798,5.169690501600853
7481413,5,B016YPHWOG,"Excellent movie!
Very entertaining and great acting by Regina Case.
The movie portrays very well the Brazilian social class where the wealthy people do not care and do not mix with poor people and the poor people are respectful and keep distance.  The movie also portrays very well what happened to many poor families in Brazil where parents, sometimes, need to move away to a big city faraway from their kids in order to have a job so they can provide for the family.",1453334400,,468,4.571428571428571
7481414,4,B016YPHWOG,Not the usual predictable Hollywood cliches and stereotypes. Real-life seeming characters rather than caricatures. A fun story with some surprises. There are clashes based on different expectations of the generations (mother-daughter) and classes (maid-employer).,1453248000,,263,6.764705882352941
7481415,2,B016YPHWOG,"In this movie, nothing happens. And when I say nothing, I mean it. I love Brazilian movies from all times, as a Brazilian and a researcher, but this is definitely not a good pick. Regina Cas's interpretation is good but not phenomenal - it's just Regina Cas  being herself. The plot is full of cliches with one more time the exploitation of the usual stereotype of a Northeastern maid, whose daughter was left behind to be risen by someone else while she worked for a family in So Paulo. The story is cute, but too predictable and boring. I stopped four times to do something else while I watched the movie because it just doesn't add anything different. Read a book or pick another movie.",1453161600,,689,4.512
7481416,4,B016YPHWOG,"This is an interesting film. And it is scrumptiously photographed. A well-to-do Brazilian couple living in a tropical paradise are served by an attentive maid, Val, who has raised their now teenage son. Her life has been devoted to the needs of her employers whom she rigorously subsumes herself to from dawn to dusk. And then there is her relationship to the boy, Fabinho, whom she loves as life itself. There exist rifts in the family, fault lines which detonate when Val's vivacious daughter appears on the scene for a reunion with her mother after a ten year separation. Assumptions made by the family are quickly challenged as Jessica crosses relied upon boundaries without a thought. Reservoirs of unhappiness are liberated by a momentary touch. I thought of Pasolini's Teorama while watching this film. It's a film that might be worth re-screening in conjunction with The Second Mother.",1453161600,3,893,5.04054054054054
