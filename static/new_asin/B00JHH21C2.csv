6358488,5,B00JHH21C2,"LEVIATHAN which is the name of the Russian submarine that got Destroyed by a Missile
and sank to the bottom of the ocean
this Russian sub carried a Genetic Alteration Liquid that gets mistaken by a Vodka bottle

Entertaining 1989 Sci-fi horror monster movie that feels like a cross between Alien and The Thing and was one of the many underwater creature movies of 89 with DeepStar Six, Endless Raft, The Abyss etc. yet this movie is dismissed as an Alien/Thing wannabe in the ocean. The creature effects by Stan Winston and co are quite good i should say and the acting isn't too bad, the film does co-star Meg Foster as well. I saw this in theaters as a kid and really enjoyed it, it does have silly moments but near the end when the full monster is revealed it delivers a nice climax.

6358491,3,B00JHH21C2,"Leviathan was a bit of a disappointment for the critics compared to some of the high voltage super SciFi hits in the genre during the late 1970s and the mid 1980s.  Remember movies like ""Alien"" (1979), Escape From New York (1981), ""The Thing"" (1982), ""Blade Runner"" (1982), and ""Aliens"" (1986).  Some probably considered this a B movie.  I am here to say I like it, but I will admit I have a taste for anything in this genre as long as it doesn't try to be outrageously bloodthirsty or fall on it's face with horrible F/X.  Leviathan works because they borrowed a little from a couple of other movies, but they twisted it enough to keep you guessing a little.  They did a pretty good job with the confined atmosphere in the underwater mining facility and the characterizations with some well known stars as well.  At least rent it, I don't think you will be disappointed.

6358505,5,B00JHH21C2,"Leviathan is a classic. It's like a big budget B-Movie. Sure it's essentially just taking elements of The Thing, Alien, a few others and blending them together, but it works remarkably well. It's just fun, plain and simple. And under the direction of George P. Cosmatos (Rambo 2, Cobra, Tombstone), it's elevated to badass. The blu ray is worth every penny. The print is pristine, with no discoloration issues or film grain anywhere. Every frame of film is flawless and a vast improvement over the previous standard DVD releases. Even when it comes to the dark and black colors, you won't find any specks or grain anywhere. For a film released in 1989, I have to admit I was rather impressed at the incredible job Shout! did on this transfer. The Special Features were fun to dig into as well. I think the main one, dealing with the effects work from Stan Winston studio's was by far the best and most entertaining. I think it runs somewhere around 45 minutes if I'm not mistaken. But I enjoyed how the effects crew dug into the film's history and their thoughts on how or why it just didn't connect with audiences upon it's initial release, as well as their shortcomings as effects artists working with a director who constantly butted heads with them.

6358511,4,B00JHH21C2,"BOTTOM LINE: The second of five waterlogged monster movies that flooded theaters in the summer of 1989; (DEEPSTAR SIX being the first, and the superior THE ABYSS the third - along with crummy the Roger Corman quickies THE RIFT and ENDLESS DESCENT). LEVIATHAN is fun 80's creature feature that's basically an aquatic version of The Old Dark House. Decent acting and lots of icky effects offer monster movie fans some solidly soggy thrills & chills. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A small team of highly specialized divers are mining for silver and other precious metals at a site some 16,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, working & living in a claustrophobic, pressurized complex. On an excursion away from the facility, one of the miners gets separated from his crewmate and accidentally stumbles upon the twisted wreckage of a sunken Russian ship. He brings back a strongbox from the scuttled ship's safe, (which he imagines is filled with all manner of treasure). Among the decidedly mundane contents is a seemingly innocent flask of vodka.  The alcohol was laced with a deadly mutagen however, as part of some horrific experiment which turned the entire Russian crew into involuntary guinea pigs. Unaware of this, two of the mining team sneak a little after hours drink. Shortly after being ingested, the sinister substance once again begins the genetic alteration process, metamorphosing the two victims into grotesque human/aquatic hybrids that feast on human blood. Trapped three miles below the surface, the remaining human crew must devise a way to stop the murderous mutation stalking the deep sea complex - before they're added to the creature's menu.

THOUGHTS: George P. Cosmatos' LEVIATHAN is an almost by-the-numbers clone of DEEPSTAR SIX, except with a cast of more well-known actors and a slightly higher F/X crew going for it, yet features an equally goofy-looking monster; (which co-star Ernie Hudson likened it a big, killer chicken.) The thing isn't very scary, honestly. The flimsy mouth looks too fragile and non-functional to be threatening. While the idea of a creature created by genetically fusing various deceased human team members together is undeniably frightening in concept, the actual beast we see in the film looks more like a stiff, rubbery carny sideshow attraction slathered in buckets of K-Y. This soggy shock show has many similarities to better-executed effects & concepts seen in both the original 1979 ALIEN and John Carpenter's 1982 frigid fright fest, THE THING. The human stars of LEVIATHAN and Ron Cobb's cool production designs are the real reasons to tune in. Peter (RoboCop) Weller and Richard (Rambo films) Crenna are top-billed and have the lion's share of good scenes. Cute Amanda Pays and curve-a-licious Lisa Elibacher add spunk and some much-needed eye candy amid all the sweaty testosterone. Yeoman character actors Hector Elizondo and Ernie Hudson lend credibility as everyman working stiffs trapped in a decidedly UNdesirable situation. Lastly, Daniel Sterns brings up the rear in a one-dimensional performance as ""SixPack,"" a crude comedy relief character who would probably have been played by Sid Melton had this film been shot in the 1950's.

THE BLU-RAY: Some terrific news to report for fans of LEVIATHAN: the Blu-ray presentation looks pretty dang impressive. A really HUGE jump in quality from the crappy, barebones DVD that MGM's had floating around for years previously. Shout! Factory (who else?) gives us a really sharp transfer with an excellent picture: solid blacks, strong mid-times & a vivid color palette. Lots of detail lost on previous formats is here for the eyes to drink in and enjoy. Everything just looks fantastic. More good news is that the soundmix is strong, level & clean. The sound effects and Jerry Goldsmith's terrific score can really be appreciated on this Blu-ray. Keeping with their fan-pleasing ways, the gang at Shout! Factory gives us three strong bonus features. The first is a nice, in-depth look into the special effects behind the film. Members of Stan Winston's F/X crew share their thoughts and recollections on the movie. It's well worth watching. Actors Hector Elizondo & Ernie Hudson each get a brief but interesting interview segment, providing their thoughts on the film and the process of shooting overseas in Italy. All-in-all a very nicely done job on this Blu-ray. If you have the old DVD I can confidently recommend this new Blu-ray as a worthy double dip upgrade.",1445731200,4,4503,5.155950752393981

6358519,3,B00JHH21C2,"1989 was an interesting year for underwater monster movies. James Cameron earlier announced he was making a movie about aliens, only it's all underwater. Apparently everybody thought of Cameron's Aliens and started making underwater monster movies to be released that year to compete with his film The Abyss. Deep Star Six, The Evil Below, Lords of the Deep and a couple others rose up that year. The Abyss turned out to be nowhere near ""Aliens off the Deep End of the Pool, so all of these movies became the underwater horror genre that was created from a false assumption. Leviathan is one of those films, and it's the best of the bunch. While the film is still derivative and rife with the shortcomings that come from your common horror film it has a great cast, good production values and a decent script.

Leviathan is about a deep sea mining operation that stumbles upon a derelict Russian science ship. When a group of them come back from scouting the wreckage they brought back with them something that threatens to not only kill the entire crew, but potentially wreak havoc on the outside world. This sounds like a lot of other horror/suspense/sci-fi films out there, and this movie isn't shy about it. The film plays on the fact everybody is confined to a little underwater base far away from any help, much like those cabin in the woods type horror flicks. Then goes into a sense of paranoia similar to movies like The Thing.

The script seems well thought out at first. Then it starts to fall apart. Establishing the setting worked very well in the first act. There was also some establishment of the characters on a deeper level than just a name and a trait. Then they come back from the Russian vessel and that's when the stupid stuff starts to happen. On one level they way the monster is introduced is rather clever. However how they handled it just went downhill from there. The characters start doing stupid things like leaving corpses unattended or going off alone when they know something is not right on the base. Once you start getting revelations on the monster itself they come and go so fast it's hard to soak in, which is a shame.
Then you have the company VIP who they call now and then who does nothing for the film other than stare blankly at the camera and give the viewer a feigned reason to hate corporations. A lot of the character development made prior is tossed by the wayside in place of building a body count. I suppose said character development was only there so you can start caring for the future victims, but it really didn't go far enough to pull that kind of emotional reaction from me.

The acting, in spite of the poor actions by the characters, is solid. Peter Weller was likely called onto this gig after his fame garnered from films like Buckaroo Bonzai and Robocop, and he hammers out his role as reluctant leader well. Richard Crenna play his complicated character with fine subtlety that a lesser action would have made over dramatic. Amanda Pays was able to convince me of her character's expertise despite the fact she was likely cast as eye candy. I can go on and on. Aside from Meg Foster (the robot-esque company VIP) acting is well done all around. Music is also done by Jerry Goldsmith and lends a lot to make the movie sound polished. Add to that design greats like Stand Winston and you start to realize there is a lot of talent tied to this film.

Horror/Sci-Fi lives and dies by creature design. This particular monster is an intriguing concept. I won't go into it much as I don't want to spoil it. It looks pretty cool and grotesque too. They don't reveal too much of the monster so the effect isn't spoiled. Other design choices are just as cool. The movie's underwater scenes were not shot in water, but instead shot with the cameras amped up in speed enough so when they run the footage it looks like the actors are moving against water. Add to that some blue filters and throw some dust and other particles in the air and you have a convincing underwater looking shot. Since this is deep underwater they have these huge and really cool underwater pressure suits. The attention to detail given to the suits and how they are maintained really do a lot to elevate this film beyond B-movie levels. The base of operations is also neat and functional looking. The computer screens start to look too dated when they start showing any kind of 3-D graphics, which may have been cutting edge in 1989 but now look archaic. If I have to give one reason to watch this movie these design elements are it.

Shout Factory has been digging up lots of the forgotten cult hits and giving them a great release. Leviathan gets the same treatment. The high definition transfer looks really great. Lots of details come out clear and with a sharp color palate. The ""underwater"" scenes look a bit muddy with the colors muted a bit more, but I think that's more due to the cinematography than a bad transfer. Audio is in both the original stereo (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0) and a surround sound mix (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1). As neat as having a surround mix is I still prefer the original stereo mix as the dialog seems to get drowned out more in the more dynamic scenes in the 5.1 mix. Shout Factory was able to put together an impressive host of extras (all in high definition) for a film like this. Here is what you get:

Leviathan: Monster Melting Pot -  This is a pretty extensive feature that goes into the making of the film. It includes interviews with cast and crew. The neat little gem on this documentary is the interviews with the late, great Stan Winston's special effects crew. They don't gloss over the controversial subjects either, which makes this feature a really accurate look into working in Winston's team.

Dissecting Cobb with Hector Elizondo - An interview with the actor regarding his character and anecdotes on the filming.

Surviving Leviathan with Ernie Hudson - Similar to Elizondo's interview, only with Hudson's point of view.

In the realm of film making overall Leviathan is merely an ""Also Ran"" kind of film that got some attention for a few years then was forgotten. In the realm of monsters-in-my-undersea-station genre of films it shines a lot brighter. While not a perfect film in the slightest Leviathan has a lot of neat things going for it that should pique the interest of a few of you out there. Sci-fi fans who enjoy underwater tech will have something to like here. Rampaging monster fans will really enjoy this.",1428451200,,6500,4.615051903114187

6358538,5,B00JHH21C2,"I went into this expecting it to be a B-film, and was very pleasantly surprised to learn it was a hundred times better than anything I expected.

The story centers around an deep-sea mining crew. One day, a crewman (Daniel Stern, ""Marv"" from Home Alone) gets lost and stumbles upon a sunken Russian scientific research vessel. The mystery begins: the Russians have the ship listed as active duty, but clearly this thing's been here for a while. All the recovered logs detail a bizarre virus and the crew's death, and from there the horror starts.

The acting is great from all involved. At this point, pretty much everyone is a known actor (Weller as RoboCop, Hudson as Winston from Ghostbusters, Stern from C.H.U.D. and Home Alone), and with Stan Winston Studios doing creature effects (incredible work by them), this comes off as a top-talent viewing. Comparing this to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is both fair and unfair: fair because the general idea is similar (ordinary blue-collar workers caught against a hideous monster far from help), unfair because of the stark differences between the films (location, monster's origin and abilities). It is a very well-done film, make no mistake.

If you're on the fence, hunt up a relatively cheap copy, but otherwise you can rest assured that paying a higher price won't mean dollars wasted. Leviathan will pull you under.",1415923200,,1365,4.978070175438597

The creature effects were very well done, They tended to be on the cheesy side but work quite well with the overall cheesy nature of the flick. Peter Weller rocks as the lead and pulls the camera towards himself every time he shows up. Scream factory, as always, does a stellar jpb.
