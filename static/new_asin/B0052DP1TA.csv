4529725,1,B0052DP1TA,"John Carpenter has managed to create his own genre throughout the past three decades and had become an auteur from early on, with films like Halloween (1978), Escape from New York (1981), and The Thing (1982).  But this time he regurgitates the ""gotcha!"" moment filled horror films that are all too present these days.

The Ward is a supposed psychological horror film that contains a zombie-like ghost that haunts a mental asylum but instead of maintaining a creepy atmosphere and having an intriguing way to retell the popular story of a haunted asylum, Carpenter simply rips off other schlock films The Grudge and The Ring remakes.  He utilizes the tired approach of ""gotcha!"" moments when things are just around each corner and never attempts to intrigue us with a premise that's new.

Also, the film is entirely predictable and to add insult to injury, it rips off Fight Club and Identity, in which the latter was a terribly predictable film on its own.

The Ward didn't bore me but bothered me because I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters within it; and hiring Jared Harris hadn't helped either because even his presence and acting skills could not save this dreadfully dull experience.

This is not a John Carpenter film by a stretch, even if his name is on the DVD and Blu-ray cover boxs.  This film is a rental at best.  Or even better, watch it for free if you can borrow it off of a friend who had the misfortune of purchasing it.

4529726,5,B0052DP1TA,"It's great to see John Carpenter coming back. Waiting for the dvd release, I had the pleasure of watching the film in theaters, and I was more than happy to realise that I was right in feeling that there is a huge gap between the horror movies of John and the ones that are produced in excess today. Carpenter's horror-as also Polanski's-was never an end itself, but it carried a cerain regard of life and the world in general, and that is what made his movies so influential. Here we have an extraordinary example of a movie made to haunt. With a dreamy feeling and a claustophobic atmosphere that grabs you, John Carpenter's The Ward is simply the greatest horror movie you've watched for many years, and in the tradition of Repulsion and Assault on K13-combining a feeling of both-it is destined to be a classic. Say hello to the Master(not only of horror, but of cinema in general)!Welcome back ,and I can hardly wait for the next project. John Carpenter over all!",1306972800,33,968,4.601156069364162

4529744,4,B0052DP1TA,"I really like John Carpenter's the Ward.  While it does have a slight low budget quality to the actual fears, it's enjoyable enough to recommend.

It's about Amber Heard's character who is seen burning down her country home, so the police come and take her to a psychiatrist hospital where she meets several other equally attractive girls with their own mental problems such as Lyndsy Fonseca, Laura-Leigh, and especially Sydney Sweeney.  The girl holding the doll and pretending to be a child was especially adorable and interesting, because she'd end up having a little misadventure around the hospital with Amber's character.  Also Mamie Gummer was memorable because she was the forceful/aggressive bully (at least, she starts out that way until the story unfolds, then she grows concerned/nervous).

Anyway it turns out certain extreme tests are being done on certain victims... and they aren't very nice tests.  The outcome isn't good let's put it that way.  When the girls question the disappearance of their fellow patients nobody gives an explanation because all the nurses and doctors are in on the testing, hehe.  So eventually Amber sets out to search for an explanation herself by escaping her room.  She's constantly restrained by the doctors and forced back inside her room for one reason or another throughout the film, but it's surprising she's not treated worse by way of extreme punishment considering how nosey she was getting.  Well without spoiling too much, it turns out there's a deceased demonic-faced girl haunting and tormenting the entire psychiatric facility.  I guess that means the testing done on her wasn't successful, lol.  She utilizes her disappearing abilities to reappear in ways that frighten the girls... one by one if you get my drift.

To me the film is clearly relying on the attractiveness of the girls as a way to lure (male) viewers in, and it works, because I'm lured!  I'm on the end of a fishing pole so reel me in baby!  But you know, the storyline is pretty creepy and memorable, the atmosphere is dreary enough to get the job done (though nothing especially great) and the characters are all given enough time that you learn to care about them, so I think this is a pretty solid movie overall.  Perhaps the story should have elaborate more on the background of the tormented girl haunting the place instead of relying on the female patients to provide the story, but well, these girls are stuck inside a psychiatric hospital so there's not much more than can be done there understandably.",1439510400,,2539,4.938823529411764

4529767,4,B0052DP1TA,"A magnificent return to form from John Carpenter, a wholly original story, consistent and creepy tone, with decent performances steer this film into classic territory. It's a handsome, sturdily-crafted genre film, and an effective yarn that, until the very end, cloaks its true nature suspensefully.  In some ways, John Carpenter's The Ward distinguishes itself most by what it is not, rather than what it is.

There's no doubt this is a different Carpenter than we have seen in some time.  For all their respective virtues, Vampires (1998) and even the beloved Ghosts of Mars (2001) featured at least some sense of cheesiness or cheeky humor.  Not The Ward. This film is stripped down, efficient, and serious.

I recommend this title to anyone that enjoys a paranormal/psychological thriller that's full of emotion. It's clearly a must-own for people's collections.

As for the Blu-ray's specs;

Picture: 4.5 - The image's slight grain is intact and the colors are simply gorgeous. Carpenter's use of lighting and such is a big plus and is translated very well.

Audio: 4.5 - The film's lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track is filled rich, crisp sounds and the dialog comes across as being dynamically clear.

Extras: 2.5 - Not much other than a trailer and some commentary.

Overall, a nice addition to the Blu-ray library and a sign that Carpenter still has the ""touch"".",1398729600,,1384,5.030701754385965
4529768,3,B0052DP1TA,"This film is nothing special.

Major studios are afraid of giving John money because of the Ghosts of Mars

financial disaster. As well as Big Trouble in Little China and Escape from LA

(where Russel lost a heck load of cash too) Everytime he gets a big budget,

the film flops. This is the reason why we have not seen any major releases

from Carpenter in like 1.5 decades. The WARD in my honest opinion was just an

average movie and im surprised its a John Carpenter picture.... A psych ward

with every female that looks like an Abercrombie model??? I know they cant

just cast some regular average people or w/e but still... Some of the acting

by the girls was terrible imo, and just did not work whatsoever for me.

I heard a long time ago a rumor of a film that carpenter was gonna do with

Nicholas Cage about a prison riot while a kid was touring the prison as a

""scared straight program"".... That sounded like a bigger budget

""action/thriller"" of a ride that John could have done well.

That obviously fell through and now we still have not had a good Carpenter

film in a long time. I don't care though, I'll just rewatch THE FOG, BIG

TROUBLE, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, THEY LIVE ETC ETC....

Carpemter will always remain one of my favs in this genre and even if he

doesnt do another film, at least I have so many classics that I can revisit!

Concerning THE WARD however, I can recommend it for a watch, but don't expect

it to be a film you will watch many more times. It has no replay value to me

whatsoever...Maybe you guys will disagree, but I didn't really like it, I

thought it was average at best unfortunately...",1398124800,,1634,4.358803986710964
4529769,4,B0052DP1TA,"A pretty decent horror movie, though I feel like they rushed into the explanation of things. Not necessarily the ending (Ill get to that in a bit) just what is really going on.  I know that the director probably showed each of personalities as separate entities because they technically are, but what I don't like is does everyone around her see each entity individual or do they see them through her, and how is she really acting around others around her?

I know this really has no importance to the script so the clips are only shown how she viewed to the staff at the hospital and not other patients, but I feel that part is a little left out. And when the doctor tells her what is going on, she just believes him automatically? Yes she did try and correct him once, but that didn't last long and she didn't put up much of a fight about it.  We see each of these individual characters as separate people but then in a few minutes time you give us a quick explanation and were just supposed to believe it?

The ending, no Im not going to talk about how it ended Im just going to add that I found it very cheesy and it ruined the whole movie for me. Which is why I couldn't give this a full 5 star rating.",1395360000,,1207,4.189655172413793

I liked the setting in a 1960s mental institution. I liked Amber Heard (channeling Naomi Watts) as the main character. I even liked the overly-cute, female patients and thuggish staff. What I didn't care for was the constant feeling that I had seen it all before in other movies. Several leap to mind right away, and the mere mention of their titles would give away too much of THE WARD's plot, and grand finale!

4529787,3,B0052DP1TA,"We have a young woman named Kristen (Amber Heard, ""Drive Angry"") who finds herself pretty beaten up, cut and without her memory, if that isn't bad enough she's held against her very will at a deadly psych ward for women called North Bend Psychiatric Hospital. Whats even worse than this is the fact that this building is of course hiding some sort of secret, which Kristen must attempt to find out while trying to get her memory back together piece by piece.

It sounds typical and sometimes it is, but I give credit to writers Michael & Shawn Rasmussen for not pulling any punches in how they wrote the dialogue or how the secrets are revealed as the movie goes along. Its nothing new but the guys do have some talent when it comes to this kind of genre it seems. The pacing is also kept good by director John Carpenter (""The Thing"") who always has a knack for directing these type of horror/suspense movies.

Heard is also something of a treasure on the eyes and isn't too bad of an actress to boot, sure she's more looks than anything but she's got a good screen presence. The other female patients are the standard horror cliche fare as are the doctor trying to help Kristen and the nurses who have their own motives. There is the expected twist which honestly isn't all that shocking but then again most horror concepts have been done to death so it isn't too big of a stunner when it happens.

Its also a pretty short movie, less than 90 minutes so it doesn't waste time diving into Kristen's decent into madness as she tries to discover why she's here and why she can't remember anything.

4529790,4,B0052DP1TA,"""The Ward"" marks the return of John Carpenter to directing after a near 10 year hiatus after ""Ghosts of Mars.""  ""The Ward"" represents the kind of film Carpenter does best...a spooky, shadowy supernatural thriller with an unknown force stalking victims at an insane asylum.  It's also an old-fashioned ghost story done with class, style, and the director's signature pannache. I am definitely a Carpenter fan.  He uses an economy of storytelling that I find refreshing especially in this era of excess where, especially in the horror genre, where directors believe more is more, not less.  ""The Ward"" tells the story of a young woman, played extremely well by Amber Heard< who wakes up in an asylum after torching a house, although she has no recollection as to why or what brought her to the asylum.  Her unit id filled with disturbed teens, all there for various reasons...presided over by a mysterious psychiatrist (played with Hitchcockian murkiness by Jarred Harris).  The asylum has also had a rash of ""disappearances"" committed by a disfigured woman whom we only get passing flashes of, who is offing the young women.  Heard is dtermined to find out not only what brought her to the asylum, but who or what is stalking them all before she is claimed as the next victim.

Carpenter does not break new ground here, but he clearly demonstrates his skill as a filmmaker as the film has a polish and is often genuinely scary.  I jumped many times in watching ""The Ward"" and I also admired the excellent performances by all, especially Heard (makes a gutsy heroine) and Harris, whose casting track record makes him a perfect choice for the role as we are not certain as to whether he is naughty or nice.  Carpenter does not rely on gratuitous gore (though he does not shy from gore either), but rather creepy cinematography, an eerie score, and strong acting and directing.  ""The Ward"" is a quality thriller, much better than most of what passes for horror these days, and Carpenter deftly pulls a surprise ending (I didn't see it coming anyway) that works quite well.

The bluray presentation is excellent.  Colors are well saturated and the film's grain structure remains in tact giving the movie a wonderful, filmic texture.  There is no evidence of DNR, aliasing, banding, or any other pitfalls or attempts at artifically sharpening the film.  This renders some terrific details, especially the truly creepy make-up effects by KNB.  The soundtrack is mastered in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and it is a stellar listen.  Every clap of thunder ans burst of music on the soundtrack sounds pristine.  Dialogue is crisp and well-prioritized.  Sound effects are terrifically detailed, only adding to the film's creepiness.  I have heard the SD version is a rather lousy print, so BD is the only way to go here to appreciate the film.

""The Ward"" heralds Carpenter's return to form.  He has given us a classy ghost story.  It's scary and well-made.  This is a great movie to rent and watch with your girlfriend on a Saturday night to get her to grab on to you for protection.  I greatly enjoyed the film, and for Carpenter fans, it is a must-own.",1334793600,4,3129,4.803738317757009
4529791,4,B0052DP1TA,"There was a time when the future of Horror Cinema was in the hands of George Romero, Brian De Palma,  Euro Director Dario Argento and of course, John Carpenter as each new film would be anticipated as a new banquet for Horror fans.  Now in the digital age where we are bombasted by remakes, sequels and loud overproduced torture porn outings, its refreshing to see a return to the stylish approach to the genre as John Carpenter returns with 'THE WARD' , a film which treads waters already sailed upon but has such a beautifull visual sense that it seems more original than the psychological forays which preceded it.  You've read about most of its premise in the reviews contained here but I just had to revel in the wonderful cinematography by Yaron Orbach which glides and soars under Carpenter's expert direction and the wonderful performances by Amber Heard and Jared Harris who's stint on AMC's hit series 'MAD MEN' will make you appreciate him even more.  With makeup effects by the new masters of the genre Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger and a melancholic music score by Mark Kilian, 'THE WARD' emerges as an old school thriller of the first order and is recommended to all Horror fans wanting to see how a good premise can be accomplished by craftsmen who care.

4529792,3,B0052DP1TA,"In ""John Carpenter's The Ward,"" Amber Heard plays Kristen, a young woman sent to the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital. Kristen, who at the beginning of the film is seen setting a fire on a house, is locked up in this institute with other female inmates. The time is set in 1966, one year before the time of ""Girl, Interrupted,"" but the big difference is that the patients of this gloomy-looking hospital mysteriously disappear one after another.

The story of Kristin, who soon learns the secrets of ""the ward,"" unfolds too slowly to hold interest. The moody photography and production design are decent, but the film cannot sustain the tension in the first half of the film, where we are given no reason to care as to what happens to the amnesiac protagonist or her inmates.

Things get better considerably in the second half, where the film picks up the pace and becomes interesting in the climax, a well-constructed sequence of action and suspense. Too bad it takes too much time to get there.

""John Carpenter's The Ward"" is the veteran director's first feature film in almost ten years (the last one being ""Ghosts of Mars""). Had ""The Ward"" been released much earlier, the thriller could have received much positive reviews from fans and critics alike.

I was hoping that it would be entertaining and bring a little something different to the ""mental patient/psych ward"" story.  However, I was wrong.  The movie is OK, but it is nothing new.  It is the same old story rehashed over and over thus making it very predictable.  It is well directed and the acting is ok.  But when a story is rehashed so often with nothing new added into the mix it becomes rather boring regardless of the talent behind it.  From the reading the back cover of the DVD, I was hoping for an actual ghost story.  But it turns out the predictable ""twist"" alot of ghost stories have used is in this story too.

Nothing new, descent acting, good directing, the make up of the ghost looked a bit cheesey as opposed to scary.  However, I did like the camera views of the hallway.  As much as I liked the looooong stretchy hallways it isn't a movie I would watch again.

On a side note it was nice to see a horror type movie without alot of gratutious sex and nudity.  There wasn't any gore or extensive kill sequences in the movie so that was a treat.  Just wished it was more original.",1328918400,2,1198,4.290178571428571

4529796,3,B0052DP1TA,"<strong>The Ward</strong> (John Carpenter, 2010)

If you're even a casual John Carpenter fan, you've heard both sides of the debate on this movie. I'm here to tell you that both sides are right, interestingly enough. The critics are spot-on when they say that <em>The Ward</em> can't hold a candle to the films Carpenter made in his eighties glory days. And yet the fans are still correct when they claim that <em>The Ward</em> is Mr. Carpenter's finest outing since at least <em>They Live</em> twenty-two years before. That's not as much of a contradiction as you might think, and I say this as one of the two? three? people on the planet who didn't consider <em>Ghosts of Mars</em> to be a complete and utter failure.

The plot: Kristen (<em>Zombieland</em> beauty Amber Heard) is institutionalized on a ward with a number of other patients--Emily (<em>Stop-Loss</em>' Mamie Gummer, the daughter of Meryl Streep), Sarah (<em>Mr. Brooks</em>' Danielle Panabaker), Zoey (TV character actor Laura-Leigh in her first big-screen appearance), Iris (<em>Hot Tub Time Machine</em>'s Lyndsy Fonseca), and Tammy (Sali Sayler in her film debut)--all being treated by the long-suffering-but-affable Dr. Stringer (<em>b. Monkey</em>'s Jared Harris). All well and good, but not long after Kristen's arrival, the girls start disappearing one by one, and Kristen has to figure out what's going on before the killer gets to her.

Sound familiar? It should. And if you guessed that the Big Twist(TM) will sound exactly like that of a certain highly underrated horror film made seven years before it, you'd be right about that, as well. But I'm not going to take points off for that, because there's really not much new under the sun in traditional horror films. And let's face it, what John Carpenter has always done best is traditional horror films. So you could accuse him of phoning it in, but this movie, despite its flaws, never really feels like that. There's an enthusiasm to it that's infectious, as if Carpenter was a kid who'd been kept away from the candy store for the past decade and was finally allowed to load up on horehound and sassafras again. And despite most of the characters seeming to be somewhat two-dimensional (pay attention, though, and it all makes sense), they're kind of fun to be around, most of them. The most surprising character here is Dr. Stringer; how often is it that the doctor in a movie like this is portrayed as a sympathetic, hardworking chap who really does seem to have his patients' best interests at heart?

Alas, however, therein lies the movie's one really big flaw. It's a scene about halfway through that is, shall we say, ill-conceived. And that's an understatement. It yanks us out of the perspective we've had so far in the film, it is a radical change in the doctor's character, and--at the time it appears in the film--it makes absolutely no sense. It does after the Big Twist, but the fact that it's there at all tells you you should be Getting Ready for a Big Twist, and even if it didn't, well, it just sits there completely unlike the rest of the film (Stringer's personality heads right back to normal when we see him again). I think it may have been meant as a red herring, but I still can't be sure. In any case, Howard Hawks said that what makes a good movie is ""three great scenes, no bad ones""; that's the scene that keeps <em>The Ward</em> from being a good movie, though I can't say it's bad in any way. It's a satisfactory chiller, and honestly, had it come from a director less legendary than Mr. Carpenter, I don't think we would have seen nearly as much debate on it as we did. It's certainly a decent way to kill an hour and a half, because even though you've seen it before, like the James Mangold film I referenced earlier (see what I did there? Now, with both those clues, you can figure out exactly what it is without my having told you, so no one can yell spoiler), it's done with more than enough style, pacing, and panache to make it worth watching again with a fresh, young cast of rising stars. ** ",1325116800,,4064,4.742574257425742

4529799,4,B0052DP1TA,"This was a major return for veteran Director John Carpenter, whose work in the past decade or so has left many fans disappointed and confused. After the much deserved success of ""The Thing"", Carpenter seemed to have lost his feel about how special effects would transfer to film. In The Ward, Carpenter relied more on story and suspense than going all for broke with special effects, and the result is a classic movie that continues to build in suspense and has a ending that comes as a complete, and welcome shocking surprise. The film is atmosperic and well told by this Master of the Macbre, and the special effects flow seemlessly into the developing story. While not as graphic or horrifying as The Thing he definately rediscovered his ability to tell a story that catches the viewers imagination and leads one down paths that in the end, left me feeling completely taken in until the near end of the film .One of the best Carpenter films I have seen in years, and will no doubt hold it's on as time goes by.",1320710400,,1013,4.571428571428571

4529801,3,B0052DP1TA,"I certainly didn't suspect such a rookie-like ending from John Carpenter, and I have to say that those final moments take something away from an already somewhat weak storyline leading up to it.  Perhaps all those years away from directing feature-length films has left Carpenter a little rusty; even apart from the droll predictability of the ending, The Ward just doesn't strike me as the work of a master director.  The film succeeds in drawing you into the story, but you never truly bond with the characters and there is very little in the way of real suspense or horror.  Carpenter is seemingly content to keep reaching his hand into the same old bag of tricks that every other Hollywood horror director has relied upon for years and years.  The Ward isn't a bad film, but it's certainly a disappointing John Carpenter film - derivative, much too predictable, and far too reliant on scare tactics that stopped being scary in the 1980s.

We don't know much about Kristen (Amber Heard) when she is first brought to North Bend Psychiatric Hospital.  She's bruised and battered and wearing nothing but a slip - just the way police found her after she burned down a farmhouse for reasons even she can't explain.  Even though she doesn't remember anything before the fire, the whole amnesia thing doesn't seem to bother her a bit, though -- she is far too concerned with escaping from the psych ward.  I can't say I blame her, really - what with some spooky and hideous looking girl roaming the halls at night and stealing her blanket from her locked room.  On the other hand, the place isn't all that bad for a psych ward, especially given the fact that there are only four other girls in the entire ward, none of whom are the drooling zombie type roaming the less restricted halls.  Apparently, Kristen and the other girls are part of some experiment on the part of Dr. Stringer (Jared Harris).  Iris (Lyndsy Fonseca) is a talented sketch artist; Sarah's (Danielle Panabaker) only fault seems to be the type of self-conceit that goes along with being beautiful; Zoey (Laura-Leigh) has the intellect of a child; only Emily (Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer) demonstrates the type of behavior that would typically be considered crazy.  A rebel at heart, Kristen proves a rather trying patient for Dr. Springer, Nurse Lundt, and the orderlies, attempting to escape on multiple occasions.  She tries to tell them that there's a ghost on the ward who is trying to kill her, but of course they don't believe her.  Things only get worse when the other girls begin disappearing.

If this sounds a lot like your run-of-the-mill Hollywood horror plot, that's because that is exactly what it is.  There is nothing her that any horror fan hasn't already seen before - probably in more effective films than this one.  Here and there, Carpenter manages to generate a slight amount of tension and suspense, but these moments are fleeting - and there are no chills to be had from the sudden appearance of the ghost in any situation.  Truth be told, Carpenter even fails to generate an atmosphere appropriate for any mental health ward - haunted or not.  His overreliance on character stereotypes and utterly predictable plot twists make this a most uninspired effort.  Even a much less renowned director could have phoned this one in and achieved similar results.",1318896000,6,3353,4.818499127399651
4529802,3,B0052DP1TA,"It's been a long time coming for John Carpenter's return to directing feature-length films. A decade has come and gone since the beloved director gave us the mixed-bag ""Ghost of Mars"" and the horror genre hasn't been quite the same without him. Aside from directing a few ""episodes"" of the ill-fated ""Masters of Horror"" series and cashing checks from a string of remakes based on his work, ol' JC has remained relatively low-profile, making ""The Ward,"" his proposed comeback film, of significant interest to horror fans everywhere.

Unfortunately, it's that same interest that may seriously hamper any enjoyment one might derive from the film. Let's just get the fact that ""The Ward"" is no ""Halloween"" or ""The Thing"" (heck, it's not even a ""Big Trouble in Little China"") right out of the way. Entering ""The Ward"" with any preconceived notions about what a John Carpenter film should be in 2011 will almost undoubtedly end in disappointment. Having said that, the man brings the atmosphere and creepiness in full effect, putting on a slick, polished and tightly-paced show that will likely bring a smile to the faces of unsuspecting audiences. Good enough for you?

Modern-day Scream queen Amber Heard plays Kristen, a troubled young girl who is dumped into an insane asylum after setting a farmhouse ablaze. It's not long before a supernatural force inhabiting the mental ward starts stalking her and the variety of girls she shares a home with. Ultimately, it's up to Kristen to put to rest the demon that plagues the ward as well as herself, which appears to be a rather simple task seeing as how this institution doesn't have jack for security. But hey, it's the 1960s, right?

Heard plays the part well. One-part strong female, one-part loopy mental patient, you never know if you're supposed to root for her or want her to give it a rest. Likewise, her counterparts in the film, played by the likes of Mamie Gummer and Danielle Panabaker are endearing and somewhat ""off"" at the same time. Despite working with a weak script (which inevitably succumbs to a somewhat predictable and over-used ending), Carpenter brings the goods. The film not only looks and sounds good, but manages to evoke the kind of creepiness and tension rarely seen in the more extreme fare that cropped up in his absence. The score, composed by Mark Kilian, must be mentioned as well. Truly haunting and memorable, it adds to the character of the film and is a rare instance in a John Carpenter film where having the director not score a scene himself is okay.

In a way, ""The Ward"" is a return to a more classic horror movie style. It looks and feels very Carpenter-ish and has a very distinct sense of timelessness (or as much as any period-piece can). It's a predictable film, yes; however, it's also an entertaining and well-executed thriller elevated by the tried and true skill of a great director. If one thing can be taken away from ""The Ward,"" it's that Carpenter has still got ""it"" and just needs a better script to get his career back on track. Rumors of John Carpenter's death have been greatly exaggerated.",1318896000,16,3096,4.81390977443609

I'm a huge fan of Halloween, The Fog and The Thing, so obviously Carpenter is my favorite horror director of all time.

She meets some other girls her age there and then she begins to realize that some dark force is keeping them from ever getting a chance to leave alive. The acting from all the girls is good, with Amber Heard turning in her best performance. The script does borrow from a number of movies and the twist is satisfying, but it seems almost a copy of two other films I won't mention (it would give it away).

As you probably already know, The Ward is about a young lady brought to a sanitarium in the late 60s after she has torched a farmhouse.  On the ward she meets a few other young women, and begins to have visions of a zombie-like woman.

What she finds out just may or may not  surprise you.
I guess the problem here is that so much time has passed since Carpenter made a feature film that expectations have been growing unexpectedly high over the years.  Sure, psycho wards and ghostly girls(or even a combination of the two) seem to pop up a lot in horror movies anymore.  Carpenter's in a bad position having made so many groundbreaking films that set the standard for the modern horror film.  How do you continue this trend?  Today, Carpenter has to compete with six thousand substandard horror movies that have all pretty much owe their existence to his movies.  He's been ripped off and remade so many times that he's now competing with watered down and Hollywoodized John Carpenter wannabees!  So, yeah, I'm sure it's an uphill battle if he's trying to regain his former status.  I suppose the best thing he can do is just make a good John Carpenter movie.
With The Ward I think he pretty much does that.  His style is present, but not as much as in the past.  Is it mind blowing?  Amazing?  No, not at all.  But it is a good, solid movie in the vein of his In The Mouth Of Madness, though personally I feel not nearly as good as that film.

THE WARD is Carpenter's first film since the disastrous GHOST OF MARS, and it does have some of Carpenter's finesse and style.  The film has a creepy and ominous setting, and Carpenter uses this setting effectively.  Going into the plot might include spoilers, so I'll just admit I didn't see the plot twist coming.
The acting is quite good:  Amber Heard as our heroine Kristen gives a strong, controlled performance; Mammie Gummer (Meryl Streep's daughter) and Danielle Pannabaker give strong support and Jared Harris is very good as the resolute doctor.

I can't begin to tell you how many people have told me how they were even disappointed with most of his films. While this film suffers from an uneven script, Carpenter's direction allows you to look past all of that and enjoy the movie for what it is. I've always felt that is the case with all of Carpenter's films but in a way, that's not really a bad thing. It's a horror film and it's a well made horror film I think. I feel that with JC, directing is his greatest talent. Forget about how weak the script is or how the performances can be cheesy at times, it still works and I admire Carpenter for aiming more towards simplicity.

I want to end my review by saying that I think that Carpenter is one of the best and least pretentious directors working today. I would even place him up there with Francis Ford Coppola or Roman Polanski. He's a true independent and an artist I will even say. I even have faith that I will appreciate this movie more the next time I view it. Carpenter has never made a bad film in my mind and this film is just as good as his other works.

You won't find a straight, sharp line in this entire movie.  An opening scene featuring a house has all blurred lines.  Even human flesh, for example a medium shot of someone's arm, looks like individual pixels in some shots.  There are some signs in the background of the women's lounge area and you can't read them until later at extreme close-up - it is not a focus issue.

If you insist on superb, clear DVD's to watch then avoid this DVD.  However, if picture quality doesn't matter to you then have at it.  The sound is excellent.

My rating of 1-star is solely based on extremely poor picture quality.  It almost seems like the DVD was made from a VHS tape source.  I have many DVD's and the newer they are, the better they look.  This one is terrible.  Although Carpenter made a neat film here, ""Arc Entertainment"" put out junk.",1313798400,6,1199,4.481481481481482
4529817,3,B0052DP1TA,"John Carpenter's first feature film since the maligned Ghosts of Mars came out a decade or so ago, The Ward is a flawed yet superbly atmospheric psychological dirge.  Ultra hottie Amber Heard stars as Kristen, a young girl that finds herself in a mental ward alongside a group of other psychologically disturbed young women.  It isn't long before she discovers the presence of a vengeful ghost, and stumbles upon some secrets as well involving the seemingly benevolant doctor (Jared Harris) and the nurse and staff crew as well.  While The Ward doesn't try anything new, Carpenter manages to weave so much creepiness and mood into the proceedings that you can't help but be intrigued, even if the glaring plot holes and twist ending ultimately betray the excellent craftsmanship of the film's presentation.  Still though, between a great performance from Heard and some Dario Argento-inspired camerawork from Carpenter, The Ward is a decently entertaining and pretty creepy thriller that delivers in terms of psychological shocks and scares.  Here's hoping that it won't be another handful of years until Carpenter churns out another film.",1313712000,3,1139,5.236263736263736

4529819,3,B0052DP1TA,"Disappointing, but not because it's a poorly made movie, it's just not the movie I had hoped it would be; a case of expectations not met.  Sadly, there is bound to be a letdown when you want something from a filmmaker based solely on his previous body of work and he doesn't deliver what you want.  That said, this is a movie that is almost impossible to discuss because so much of it depends on the unsurprising `surprise' reveal.  Any descriptions would have people jumping to conclusions.  I'll just say that it's a bit of a cheat; that once seen it doesn't promote any desire to see it again.

Not a keeper, but I'm not sorry I saw it at least once.",1313712000,2,653,4.319672131147541

There's the creepy staff who act like they don't know anything and some spooks here and there. It's enjoyable though, if you seen the film Identity,then near the end of the film you will get the truth behind it all like that. If you did not watch Identity, then i did not spoil it for you. I liked the old school feel of the film. It wasn't all special effects that made the film, the acting was strong and real.

Great date night horror flick that goes easy on the blood and violence and chalks up some great pacing and sequencing that Carpenter was known for when he was at his best.  Too boot it also had the brooding score with rumbling baseline that brought back memories of Prince of Darkness.

In all, a well done, fun horror film.",1313366400,6,459,4.493975903614458
4529823,2,B0052DP1TA,"There was a time when John Carpenter was my favorite film director. Over a period of roughly ten years during my youth, he could do no wrong.

In addition, you had his early work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-on-Precinct-13-Special-Edition/dp/B00008974J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault on Precinct 13 (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the terrific made-for-TV films ""Someone's Watching Me!"" and ""Elvis."" Then came ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" and things were never really the same again.

On the basis of that trend-setting burst of creativity, I watched Carpenter's 2010 film ""The Ward"" with dedicated interest. As many know, following the 2001 disappointment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts-of-Mars-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CY6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts of Mars (Special Edition)</a>, arguably his worst film, Carpenter went into a form of semi-retirement. ""The Ward"" was his first work in a decade, and fans applauded his return. I must admit, when I read a plot description of the story bringing him out of hibernation, I scratched my head. I didn't get it. After watching the film, I still don't.

""The Ward"" takes place in 1966 at a Pacific Northwest mental hospital, an ominous labyrinthine complex with clanging doors, shadowed hallways and nightly thunderstorms. The mysterious Kristen (Amber Heard) is dragged in and marched to a floor with similar female inmates, in that they are all attractive and edgy. The skeletal staff includes a Nurse Ratched type (Susanna Burney), a menacing orderly (D.R. Anderson) and the eerie Dr. Stringer (Jared Harris). Kristen rebels and is immediately treated to a nice dose of electric shock therapy, a scene that would be frightening if it were not identical to about 100 previous films and MTV videos. Members of Kristen's inmate harem begin to disappear, the culprit a monstrous ghost stalking the halls (and showers) in peculiar zombie makeup. Kristen eventually tries to escape this prison by way of obligatory air vents and creaking service elevators. Meanwhile, the thunderstorm rages on.

A twist ending attempts to explain the confused actions of the previous hour, but it does not excuse the distracting lapses of logic and unnecessary scenes of ghastly murder. There's meager evidence this is even a Carpenter film. The soundtrack is Carpenteresque, though he did not compose it. There's menacing shadows similar to those ghosts at the end of ""The Fog."" Sadly, there's even poor casting, a peculiar trait of later Carpenter films (Roddy Piper in ""They Live,"" Natasha Henstridge in ""Ghosts of Mars,"" Christopher Reeve in ""Village of the Damned"" and Jameson Parker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-of-Darkness/dp/B0000AOX0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince of Darkness</a>). I have no idea why Carpenter cast Heard in the lead, a limited actress cavorting around in skin-tight jeans far too modern for 1966. I like the work of Danielle Panabaker as wicked inmate Sarah, exuding more presence than anyone in this yawn-inducing cast. But truth-be-told, this is an obsessively derivative screenplay (by unknowns Michael and Shawn Rasmussen) giving the actors little to work with.

The only reason this film had to take place in the 1960s was to allow for shock therapy, still in use at the time. But if this must be a period piece, take advantage of it (after all, Carpenter did come of age during that decade). There's a nice touch when the female inmates dance together to a vintage pop tune. Otherwise, there's minimum inspiration in this straight-to-DVD release. Today, Carpenter has the look of the eccentric hippie grandfather, adorned in faded jeans, a wild shock of gray hair and a disinterested attitude about his glory days. That's consistent with his rebellious aura, but the uncomfortable reality is his last two films are the worst of his career. In fact, he hasn't made a good film since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Mouth-of-Madness/dp/078062856X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Mouth of Madness</a>&nbsp;more than 17 years ago. There have been glimpses of his once-great talent, but his most recent films unravel with shockingly poor execution. It appears Carpenter's artistic drive is a shell of its former self, lacking the inspiration of his early works.

Martin Scorsese made the similar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shutter-Island/dp/B001GCUO5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shutter Island</a>&nbsp;the same year as ""The Ward."" Both take place within the dank halls of insane asylums and close with a twist. While ""Shutter Island"" is arguably Scorsese's worst film, it still flashes with his trademark moments of intense brilliance, enhanced by a great cast working with difficult material. Similar to lessor Hitchcock (a director Carpenter was once compared to), you're hooked from the start. ""The Ward"" produces nary a glint of talent, an inexcusably dull and forgettable horror film. Akin to rock concert t-shirts from the 1980s, the cool auteur hero of our youth is becoming a faded memory.",1312934400,6,6198,6.65512978986403

After burning down a farm house Kristen (Heard) is taken to North Bend Psychiatric Hospital to ""get better"".  After undergoing some experimental therapy she begins to see visions of a ghost named ""Alice"".  When the other girls begin to disappear she wonders if the ghost is even a ghost at all.  This is a movie that had so much potential and fell short.  This is the kind of movie where you can sense something is going to happen soon, you wait, and wait, then the credits roll.  I'm not saying this is a bad movie, just disappointing.  A combination of ""Girl, Interupted"", ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Waking Madison"".  For the John Carpenter fans who have been waiting for another classic by him, you may have to continue waiting.  I would call this more of a drama with some stomach jumpers then a straight horror. Overall, not a bad movie, but it had potential to be better. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think so.

4529825,5,B0052DP1TA,"I'll be short and to the point. The film has gotten a lot of bad press. Even horror ""aficionados"" have jumped off Carpenter's wagon.... My theory as to why? Well, the movie is a basic psychological thriller in the vein of ""who is really crazy and who isn't?"" That is the best I can do to explain the story without spoiling it for you. Now, many movie goers have tired of this type of film. Even I must admit that these types of horror/thriller films had run their course about 5 years ago. However, the film is well done! It is a rehash of some of the same psychological thrillers of the recent past but it is executed pretty darn well!

This is a John Carpenter film, no doubt. Many of his trademark motifs are present. The camera penetrates space, going down corridors, etc. Carpenter also handles the female cast well and shot them so well that no angle made them appear less than beautiful. And he even finds new ways to put in the old fashioned ""stingers"" he has become famous for. Guaranteed to make you jump at least once. The film isn't designed to be a who-done-it or exist as a tricky mind screw ala Shutter Island. If you want a good, atmospheric thriller go no further. Will it change your religion? Nah, but it is worth the purchase.

So, hey. Listen up. If you are a Carpenter fan, buy this DVD. If you are a fan of solid direction, buy this DVD. Honestly, the film is well done. Carpenter's best film since In the Mouth of Madness.",1310947200,89,1446,4.351851851851852
