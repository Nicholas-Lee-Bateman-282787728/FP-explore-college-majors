7855775,5,6303923704,"Though H.C. Snapper McNeil's Bulldog Drummond can be traced all the way back to nitrate film of the silent era, certainly the most fun is derived from the ""B"" series starring John Howard as Bulldog, and usually Heather Angel as his girl, Phyllis Clavering. E.E. Clive as Tenny and Reginald Denny as Algy made this a fun series for fans.

Arrest Bulldog Drummond is alas, not one of the best in the series. The plot about a death ray gives this ""B"" too much of a Dick Tracy feel, moving the series away from the more traditional plots. It does, however, still have Howard and Heather Angel, who is always a big plus. She tries to help Bulldog when her man is accused of murder, and Bulldog will have to save her and the day by not letting that death ray fall into the wrong hands. While it still is fun, and has George Zucco, it is a tick below Bulldog Drummond in Africa, a topnotch entry in the series.

This incredibly entertaining outing directed by Louis King has Bulldog (John Howard) once again being sidetracked on the eve of his wedding to Phyllis Clavering. Heather Angel gets ample screen time as Hugh's cute and fabulous girlfriend and shines like the African sun during midsummer.

The solid and stalwart Tenny (E.E. Clive) is at Bulldog's side while bumbling but loyal pal Algy (Reginald Denny) runs last second errands, desperately hoping no new adventure will arise to interfere with the nuptials. When Phyllis sees Colonel Nielson being kidnapped from Greystoke Manor by spy Richard Lane (J. Carrol Naish), however, the chase is on!

Just missing them as their plane takes off for Africa, an undaunted Bulldog, finally with pants Algy has been trying to deliver, grabs his own plane and takes to the skies. Phyllis has to stow away because Bulldog is trying to keep her out of harm's way; a cute circumstance which happens often in the film.

Once in Africa, our gang gets tangled up with crooked cops, most notably Lane's henchman, Deone Fordine, winningly portrayed by a young and dashing Anthony Quinn. Barely escaping a bomb planted on his plane, they race to rescue the Colonel from a lion in an exciting finish.

A fun tone, pleasant finale, and plenty of atmosphere make for one of the best entries in the series, and everything a good ""B"" is supposed to be. Bulldog fans need all the films in the series, so this double feature is a good one if you haven't seen them. While Bulldog Drummond in Africa is the better entry, as ""B"" films go, both are very fun, entertaining the viewer, which is all a ""B"" series was meant to do. A must for fans.",1244419200,,2566,4.579520697167756
