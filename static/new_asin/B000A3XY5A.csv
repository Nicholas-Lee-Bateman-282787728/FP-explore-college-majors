2356911,5,B000A3XY5A,"I never saw a trailer, television ad or any other kind of promotion for Crash, but I read about it online and knew that I wanted to see it. Based on what I read online, it was one of those all-too-common pseudo-intellectual films where a bunch of seemingly unrelated people all end up having connections before the end of the film. Because I'm a sucker for those types of movies, I wanted to see it, but I got far more than I was expecting.

It's a movie about racism, and it will keep you thinking for several hours (maybe even days). It's got some pretty funny dialogue, but you feel a little guilty for laughing at most of it. Most of the dialogue, however, is frighteningly honest and real.

Crash also has some incredibly suspenseful moments; a couple scenes had Donnice squeezing my hand so hard that it hurt.

It's also got great acting: Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillipe, Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Jennifer Espisito, Matt Dillon, as well as some other great actors who were new to me.

See this movie! It deserves far more attention than it's getting.",1115337600,2,1074,4.607329842931938
2356912,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a wonderful film. It does strain your suspension of disbelief, but it's so compelling that you don't really mind. Best of all, it's not preachy. It is an exquisitely acted, skillfully directed, and beautifully written examination of simple commonplace human frailty and cruelty. It also has some unexpected bitingly funny moments, for example: the chop-shop guy's lecture on the effacacy of forensic science. (I laughed so hard I was in tears, and my laughter lasted so long that when the rest of the audience was clearly done laughing at the scene they began to laugh at me.) Not mention the moments of very nervous laughter at the racial exchanges.

So, go see ""Crash,"" it has had the good fortune to be placed in wide-release by virtue of its star-power, so it should be at your multiplex. It is one of the best films I've seen this year.",1115337600,3,852,4.718120805369128
2356913,4,B000A3XY5A,"Movies rarely come along as gutsy and daring as this one. From the first scene to the last, final moments, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, mainly because of the fine performances of such actors as Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle and others - as well as an incredible script.

  Be prepared for a lot of suspense and action. I'm probably forgetting something but there was at least one carjacking, a traffic arrest, a break-in and several, major confrontations between people of various races and backgrounds.

  The confrontations hold this film together - the many ways people see each other, based on their skin color, backgrounds and even the way they speak..and then act on those viewpoints. Often their beliefs are wrong, but wrong or right, they still have consequences. This is the type of film that forces one to think and even to examine one's assumptions.

  By the way, viewers might appreciate knowing that the director of this one was also one of hte screenwriters for Million Dollar Baby, another film I absolutely loved. So it was no surprise to find this one so compelling as well.",1115337600,2,1098,4.767195767195767
2356914,5,B000A3XY5A,"A wonderful, intelligent, compelling examination of racism, filled with pathos, humor. Haggis shows us a world other films are afraid to tackle.  Superb perfromances all around.  I will be seeing it again soon.",1115337600,10,210,5.333333333333333
2356915,5,B000A3XY5A,"Two young Black men walk out of an Italian restaurant in Westwood wondering if the quality of service received was based on the color of their skin. A Caucasian couple deals with the aftermath of being carjacked. A Latino father tries to shield his daughter from the effects of racism in their community. A Black police detective has difficulty sharing his problems with his Puerto Rican partner and lover. Two white cops deal with the older partner's racist leanings. A Black couple deals with racism on a daily basis.

""Crash"", written and directed by Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby"", TV's ""EZ Streets"") handles all of these characters, and more, in a way that demands your undivided attention. As you watch these characters come alive and interact with one another, you realize that you are watching the work of a highly skilled filmmaker.

It is difficult to write about a film like ""Crash"". If I write in too much detail, I may give away a revelation or two, spoiling something in the film. If I write in vague terms, I won't be able to address the film adequately and convince you of the film's greatness. Oh, yes, ""Crash"" is a great film.

I have just barely grazed the surface of everything that happens to the various characters. The descriptions above also only graze the surface of each of the characters. In a way, the film resembles ""Short Cuts"" or ""Magnolia"", as it follows a large number of people through a short amount of time in Los Angeles. Unlike the films by Altman or Anderson, Haggis keeps the film under two hours, a blessing for most viewers. As you watch the film, you will learn about each of these people in ways that you probably won't expect. This is one involving, thought provoking film.

As the film opens, we meet the two men coming out of the restaurant. Their discussion is interesting and a bit funny, but a little theatrical. Soon, we meet another couple. Then these two couples interact. Quickly, we meet a third person. Then they interact with one of the previous people and we follow the new person to their home and learn a little about their family life. Then we meet a fourth, and quickly, they interact with a fifth, and so on. This sort of `round robin' method of story telling may sound a little confusing, but I was never lost and I doubt you will be either. The key is that each character is quickly established as an interesting though maybe disgusting, maybe normal, maybe conflicted person right away. Each person is fused into our subconscious with a few words or actions.

As the film switches back and forth, Haggis uses a number of techniques to keep the action fluid. For instance, we might follow the detective during a visit to his mother's house. As he leaves, he opens a door and the camera pans across the open door to follow the white District Attorney as he enters a meeting. Or, a character looks out a window and the camera pans across the window to reveal another character looking through their window. As the camera settles on them, the story then centers on this character. This technique creates a fluidity that keeps things moving. It also thrusts us into the middle of the action, causing our minds to keep working as we follow the stories, the characters, and the actions. Your eyes will be riveted to the screen the whole time.

Much of the beauty of the screenplay and directing is that each character is quickly established and becomes memorable. One character is introduced with a monologue revealing their deep-seated racism. It is a memorable scene. In the hands of most filmmakers, this would be the extent of exploration for this character. In the hands of Haggis, we then learn the more subtle aspects of this same character. Later, more examples of the character's racism. Then more about the same person's life. This leads to a very complete portrait of this person. Imagine the same level of detail applied to the other ten or eleven characters and you begin to get a feeling of the complexity of ""Crash"".

It would be difficult to classify any of the actors as the ""star"" of the film. It is a true ensemble piece. Each of the very good actors is playing a small role, but the roles are integral to the overall fabric of the story. Each actor is memorable. Don Cheadle, apparently the first person approached, read the screenplay and immediately signed on. He also helped to get the other actors involved in the project. His performance is, as always, great. Cheadle plays Graham, the black detective He is a tough guy, but what lies beneath the toughness? What caused him to have such a bleak outlook? During the course of the film, we learn these things, adding dimension to his character. Jennifer Esposito plays his partner, Ria. Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser play a married couple, each of whom has to deal with issues of racism, in different, believable ways. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play an affluent married couple. He is a successful television director who doesn't at first realize what he is dealing with when he and his wife have an encounter with two cops. This encounter is especially harrowing and hard to watch. It is also done in a completely believable manner, which makes it all the more disturbing. Those cops are played by Matt Dillon (in another great performance) and Ryan Phillippe. Michael Pena is particularly memorable as the Latino father. He is not well-known. Yet. Another couple of roles like this and he will break out of character actor roles. Ludacris and Larenz Tate play the two men who discuss their service at the restaurant in Westwood. Their performances are perhaps the most theatrical, and least believable, but they still work. They frequently have long conversations similar to the ""Quarter Pounder in France"" dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John  Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"". There are many more equally memorable characters, but these are the most recognizable names.

If it seems like I am holding back some information, I am. I don't want to reveal how these characters interact, completely, because that is part of the power of the film. As the stories progress, and we meet the characters, they keep changing, or encountering unexpected incidents. Part of the film's impact is the surprise we experience as these people's lives change throughout. Also, it is interesting to watch the sort of ""Round Robin"" style of storytelling I mentioned before.

""Crash"" takes place over 36 hours in Los Angeles. The scenes set during the day are bright, a bit overexposed and grainy from bright sun. Some of the transitions are also caused by bright flashes of sun. Transitioning to night, there is little difference, because Los Angeles is so inundated with light. When the characters move to less populated areas, the film becomes darker, and grainier, due to the lack of light. This visual style fits the setting. It is more than a little refreshing to find a filmmaker who creates a film that has a lot of artistic flourish, but the flourishes only enhance the story. Too often filmmakers feel it necessary to show all of the tricks they can do, whether it serves the story or not. Haggis does show off some tricks, but they don't feel intrusive.

If it sounds like I'm gushing, I am. ""Crash"" is a great film. This is the type of film that should humble other filmmakers when they realize that someone has written and created something so great.  How can they ever compare. Maybe ""Crash"" will spur artists to create more great films.",1115337600,269,7480,4.758673862760216
2356916,4,B000A3XY5A,"Based on his screenplay with Robert Moresco, Paul Haggis makes what is essentially his feature film debut with a thoroughly involving drama of disparate characters in a series of seemingly unrelated events in and around Los Angeles

One evening culminates in a car accident being investigated by police and a grim discovery for one of the detectives.  Flashback to the day before as a dozen characters deal with urban survival.  A couple of idealistic, black youths carjack an upper class couple who turn out to be the district attorney and his shallow wife.  A proud, Persian shop keeper and his wife struggle to keep their business open and safe.  A locksmith, who is Hispanic, is also a loving, protective father to his precious five year old daughter.  A repressed movie director and his combative wife are pulled over by an aggressive, angry cop and his younger, moral partner.  These are people who are haunted by guilt and fear as they strive for some kind of happiness.  As events unfold, each set of characters is affected by an apparently random act by another group which has long lasting consequences for all of them.

To detail exactly what happens will spoil a delicate web of plotlines that are mutually supporting one another in almost operatic fashion.  Haggis, who adapted the heartbreaking gem, ""Million Dollar Baby"" (and honed his writing skills on many a television series), has devised an intricate, multi-layered morality play on a grand scale.  Borrowing liberally from the story structures of his contemporaries like Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") and veterans like Robert Altman (""Nashville""), he masters the form with surprising ease and to the audience's edification.  He does not dumb down the script but rather treats his audience with intelligence.  The dialogue is on occasion wordy and blatant commentary while other times the words carry a bite and sting as they ring true to the human condition.  Any edgier dialogue would start to become Tarantino like.  Although there are several references to racial intolerance and conflict, these serve as more of a springboard to broader ideas and relationships.

Haggis wisely avoids clichs thus keeping the events and actions fresh and original.  When a scene looks like it will end expectedly, something different happens to change its direction in interesting ways.  None of the characters is truly good or evil; instead they are full blooded characters who yearn for a better life while tarnished by their current affliction be it economic, physical, or emotional.  Just when you think the film will go down a dark path with tragic results, it throws another wrinkle to keep you guessing and pleasantly surprise you.  And when tragedy does strike, it happens in an unexpected, ironic way.

Don Cheadle is part of a well cast group of emsemble players, many of whom reduced their payscales to take on what amounted to be supporting work.  It doesn't hurt if the script is as strong and well conceived as this one.  Cheadle is excellent as the detective who tries to help his mother and his often absent brother. Brandon Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the D.A. and his wife.  Terrence Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton play a glamorous Hollywood couple who must confront racial and emotional issues.  Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe are the policemen whose portrayals begin on opposite ends of the moral spectrum and wind up switching places.  Special mention goes to Michael Pena as the locksmith.

The city scenes are photographed with a gritty realism and the music, predominantly led by New Age composer Mark Isham, lends a dreamlike, aura to the film's mood.  All the major storylines are followed through by movie's end with hardly a loose end.  It is ironic that the film is reminiscent of a lesser, 1970's made-for television drama, ""Smashup on Interstate 5"".

There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course.  The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile.  You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people.  The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together.  Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller.  These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further.

Crash is an ambitious film with lofty goals that it attains with great frequency.  Haggis should be commended for weaving an ambitious tapestry of lives and fate without resorting to easy, simplistic answers.",1115337600,7,4799,5.013888888888889

2356937,1,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH is the kind of movie that makes many people hate Hollywood liberal chic.

Haggis, the film's director and writer, believes that he is smart, insightful and decent---and a fine critical thinker. He is not. He is simply a purveyor of the Bible-school idea that victims are worthy of sympathy and that Amerika is bad most of the time. His deepest idea is a whining sort of plea for us all to ""just get along."" Haggis should be assigned to writing Hallmark cards. Or maybe he should be a columnist for PRAVDA.",1525305600,,511,4.554347826086956

The movie involves several groups of people whose lives truly crash and change their destinies and attitudes. The only reason I give it three stars is because of ONE scene, Thandie Newton and Matt Dillon (spoiler alert- rescue).

It showed all different races on all different sides of racism: being victimized, being the perpetrator, and individuals perceiving discrimination even when it wasn't present.  There is good and bad happening in every character. These things gave the movie a realistic feel and it forces you to think about the good and bad in yourself; especially when it comes to treating people as an individual instead of seeing them as a stereotype. Unfortunately, the one side that was not shown in this story is people of different races and back rounds respectfully interacting with each other. I work with, live around, and hang out with people of different races all the time. I've lived in cities where I was a minority and I've lived communities that the majority are the same race as myself. I can honestly say that I very rarely see discrimination on this level.  Not that it never happens, but this movie (and mainstream media in general) tends to focus on the negative and doesn't show the average American who politely holds the door for his neighbor, regardless of skin color, ethnicity, religion etc. If all of LA acted like people in this movie.......",1519344000,,1223,4.791469194312796

Racism is absolutely still a problem, certainly in LA, but you'd have to hunt long and hard to find a whole string of separate, racially motivated whackjobs this aggressive -- or shallow. The makers of this nonsense give an offensively superficial treatment to a very serious and important subject. It was coldly calculated to get a rise out of people and agitate basically every group without contributing anything of substance. There's nothing in here about change, working for reform, fighting for justice, opening channels of communication, understanding and preventing the causes of racism, etc. It's just an unabashed reveling in ugliness and injustice. Many of the incidents portrayed weren't even realistic in modern LA, and they were the most extreme, most vile kinds of things clearly intended to play on people's emotions. I think many of the people who rated this movie highly did so only to affirm their opposition to bigotry, but the filmmakers should not get a free pass for their attempt to ""cash in"" on a relevant topic that deserves a far deeper and more thoughtful treatment. We can abhor racism without praising people who give cheap, ""token"" nods like this -- and who obviously don't care enough about the subject or take it seriously enough to put much effort into such a project. They just rely on these cheap tricks and then expect a pat on the back. Well, no, they're not getting one from me.",1496188800,4,1561,4.916666666666667

2357059,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is sometimes hard to watch. It deals with life as it is, not as it should be, and is a brilliantly interwoven tapestry of racial, religious, familial, and other assumptions, the unintended consequences of both good and evil actions, marinated in a pervasive irony. It is a breathtaking mirror to the weakness of the human character. The evil they do may work good; the good they intend often works evil. Nothing is simple. None of the characters are two-dimensional. It is philosophy, not preaching. Yes, in order to intertwine everyone so tightly in such a ballet of idealism gone wrong, cynicism and redemption, some unlikely coincidences (same cops finding same citizens two days in a row, for example) are employed. We suspend disbelief because we want closure, and the film delivers. Some moments are sickening, some are heart-rendingly beautiful. To just describe the plot and the intricate skeins of falling dominos that make up the day in question would take pages.
It is a work of art. If real-world foul language bothers you more than novel insights intrigue you, you may not be able to get into it. ""Gritty"" has been way overused in descriptions of books and movies. This one is gritty, and the grit may sand some of the scales from our eyes.
People are forced to sell out. People reject well-intentioned help they desperately need. People above all delude themselves, and the delusions bite them and others later. The system grinds you down.
It's not a happy movie though it has redemption for some characters. It's a thought-provoking movie, and a tour-de-force.
If you're like me, you won't be able to stop thinking about it for days.

With total garbage like this movie being produced there, one wonders about Noahs flood or the Divine Retribution visited upon Sodom and Gemorrah.  What could be the point in producing a show where nearly all the top actors are sleazeballs or neurotics and where no useful message is provided?  Were the producers wanting everyone to avoid going to California for anything?  Was this a message in favor or in opposition to gun control?  All racesblack, white, oriental, Middle Eastern, etc.-- are depicted in an unfavorable way. The film is such a garbled mess one has to assume that the writers and producers were themselves under the influence of illicit drugs when they made the movie.  Out of 5 stars, it deserves none, but we have to give some score so its one star.
My wife and I have seen several of Sandra Bullocks movies and have enjoyed most of them.  But this has to be the worst movie shes has ever been in.  Hers is a very minor part that would almost qualify as a cameo.  Maybe she saw the dailies and demanded that she be cut out of most of the movie?  Moreover, the title is wrong.  It should have been called Trash, not Crash.  Beyond that the film should be rated, X, not R, for its extreme violence, explicit sex acts, and foul language.  F-bombs are continuous from practically everyone except the 5-year old daughter of the Hispanic locksmith.

Some of the characters have bitter realizations of the way they are.  Probably the strongest was Matt Dillons character.  Sandra Bullocks character has a bitter lesson when she needs help and her friends cant be found or were busy.

There are many gut wrenching scenes but I am not going to mention them as that would touch the realm of spoilers.

2357095,1,B000A3XY5A,"I rarely agree with the oscars but regardless Crash has to go down as one of the worst films ever nominated for best picture. Maybe even the worst that's ever won the award to be honest. I mean to start off with the script isn't very inspiring. The pacing of the movie is terrible, it jumps around in an unfocused manner trying to cram everything in there. The characters aren't interesting, they are either boring or truly disturbed people that often lash out at others. There's not a single character to even get behind, not enough time is spent on any of them to really feel a connection. Not only that, but there's not a whole lot that these people seemed to learn, they hardly even change. The acting is okay but nothing award worthy. The actors are certainly capable but there's not much for them to work with here. I suppose Don Cheadle's character was the most interesting but the movie kinda slaps him in the face so I lost interest and didn't really care what happened.

And then of course there's what the movie is all about- race relations. The movie isn't subtle with any of it, it constantly reminds us every scene of what it's all about. The characters constantly talk about it, find themselves in situations where race tensions escalate, etc. etc. you get the picture. Crash isn't compelling because everything feels so forced and artificial. It's a very silly movie that tries to tackle serious topics and somehow garnered a lot of praise and won quite a few prestigious awards. Go figure.",1475971200,,1506,4.640449438202247

2357100,5,B000A3XY5A,"That Crash is an exceptional movie has already been established by hundreds, probably thousands, of professional film reviewers, bloggers, and amateur cinephiles.  After watching this magnificent film for the first time today, it occurs to me that every American of every race and every creed would benefit from a sober, introspective viewing  and soon.

Our culture is more aggressively divisive than at any point in my lifetime.  Yesterday, while out riding my bike, I heard a loud, sustained car horn (which will always get a cyclists attention).  I then watched a driver follow another into a parking lot just to continue laying on his/her horn at the driver ahead.  After making whatever point needed to be made, the honking driver performed a quick U-turn and continued on, presumably toward the original destination.  Think about that for a moment, somebody felt obliged to go out of their way just to be a jerk, then sped away without feeling the need to convey what the offending driver had done.  It was good enough just to be offended and to let everyone within 500 feet know about it.

Anyone in the US knows that Conservatives and Liberals don't just disagree politically any longer; in the 21st century, they are mortal enemies.  They don't just dislike a particular candidate; they hate the supporters of the enemy candidate.  Its not that they don't see eye to eye of a platform of issues, its that that other person is an irredeemable moron who doesnt deserve to have ever even been born because they are polluting the gene pool of clear-headed individuals.

While watching Crash, it occurred to me that all of us were born into first-person singular, and while some of us may occasionally, temporarily venture out of ourselves to experience life in the second-or third-person, we all live the vast majority of our time on earth between our own ears.  The 24-hour news cycle, web-based news, and social media are not without benefit, but they have combined to exacerbate a tendency toward the I/Me/My/Mine perspective.  Anyone whos ever spent any time online is inundated with opinion, spin, propaganda, and outright nastiness that reinforces our inflated and collective sense of singular, unwavering self-importance.

Insightful and nuanced, Crash offers us an alternative.  It is the type of film that fosters empathy toward others and personal accountability from ourselves, thereby running counter to some of the pervasive and unspoken messages of our culture  that the only thing more important than self is aggressive self-righteousness.  That voyeurism and exploitation are acceptable forms of escapism.  That escapism is, itself, a necessity to cope our lives which should be better (and would be if it weren't for those bleeping morons who disagree with me!!)

Crash is a movie about race and racism, class and classism.  I steered clear of this movie for 13 years because Id read that Matt Dillon portrays a white racist in the film, and I enjoy his movies enough not to see him inhabit such a role.  It caught my attention on Netflix and I decided to take the plunge.  Anticipating that I was about to watch a message movie, I was surprised and delighted to find out how subtly these themes were presented.  In the hands of another director (Spike Lee and Oliver Stone come to mind), or had this film been made in 2016 instead of 2004 (when 9/11 was still a collective national wound that united us and W was still in his first term), the filmmakers would have beat us over the head with their message, not trusting the audience to discover on its own the films over-arching themes.  By the end of Crash, we are left to consider that every one of us is racist, or classist, or something-phobic.  We are left to consider that the only thing were more angry at than those people is ourselves.

Although Crash is about what divides us, I was pleasantly surprised as I watched the film to be able to identify (ultimately) with every major character in the movie.  It is so skillfully written and realized that viewers are compelled to consider the characters silent internal narrative while they occupy the screen in silence.  Most movies settle for conveying to the audience that the characters are deep in thought; Crash invites us to consider what its characters are thinking in almost every scene.

This is a complex yet linear narrative, an interwoven story of life in Los Angeles in 2004.  We are politely asked to understand, appreciate, and empathize with the Black, the White, the Middle-Eastern, the Asian, and the Hispanic.  Similarly, we are encouraged to relate to the criminals and the law-abiding, to the capitalists, the unemployed, and the working class, and even the first-world as compared to the third-world.  Though it takes place in various L.A. neighborhoods, it is not another self-referential Hollywood movie about how good, bad, kooky, and crazy it is to live in Southern California.  It is a modern American fable that appreciates the United States as a cultural and socio-economic melting pot.  No culture or class is held up for either scorn or adulation; no way of life is presented with derision or applause.  Its an emotional movie to be sure, but we are presented with facts and asked to confront that racism of all types is still a problem in this country.

The single most impressive element of Crash is how the audience is given the opportunity to empathize with every character in the film.  We are offered motivation as opposed to excuses for the thoughts, feelings, and actions of every character of every color, presented to us without critique, without criticism, without caricature.  Given how many films are rife with the directors and/or actors ongoing editorial commentary about whats right and/or wrong with individuals and/or society, Crash is more about the audience than its cast of characters.  It presents a fine ensemble of actors, each of whom disappears into their roles and becomes utterly relatable to us as fellow human beings.

The brilliance of Crash is that it asked me to realize that Im sometimes a jerk, but without making me feel guilty about it.  If you are reading this, you are either a jerk or have done jerky things, and Crash doesnt insist that I call you out on it.  Instead, it asks me to try to understand you, what youve been through, what you're continuing to go through.  It asks you to try to understand the world to my eyes.

Without the slightest hint of sentimentality, Crash is about empathy, about personal redemption, and hope for our society.  It points out that we are all citizens of our American nation, but we are all imperfect and, consequently, so is our culture.  It doesnt demand that we analyze who is more imperfect and who is less imperfect, only that imperfection exists as part of the human condition; furthermore, that my own imperfection precludes me from judging you for yours.

Great films are living works of art.  What more, as cinemagoers, could we ask for from our art than to remind us that we are all united in being alive in a frequently dark, frequently dangerous, and frequently heartbreaking world?  This movie reminds us that our actions have consequences, but that careless actions can be forgiven rather than vilified.  We are all hurting and broken, but redemption is within our reach if we can forgive ourselves and not view those different from us (by whatever measure) as enemies.  If the person honking at the other driver for three solid minutes had seen Crash recently, its likely that he or she would not have gone out of their way to be an ass.

Crash reminded me of a meme that occasionally makes its rounds on social media: Everyone you know is fighting a battle you know nothing about.  Be nice.  That is the central theme of this movie, but its left up to each individual in the audience to interpret exactly what that means and what, if anything, can be done about it.  It challenges us to empathize, to forgive both others and ourselves  and it points out very skillfully that there is hope for our culture.  In the wake of the L.A. riots, Rodney King famously asked Cant we all just get along?  A decade later, Crash (2004) shows us how.",1475107200,,8191,4.83428981348637

It's not preachy like some films can be in which the evil white people victimize another race and must be stopped. In this film, everyone is at one point or another victimized...and also the perpetrator. We see how the characters quite literally CRASH into each other when they are forced to face the consequences of their discriminatory actions.

The actions of the characters didn't always connect with the audiences perceived prejudice. For instance, Officer Tom Hansen's reaction seemed to be over the top compared to the actual threat.

While intersecting vignettes of the lives of people of different races, cultures, and economic position, this movie helps bring understanding to why we often default to judge and fear others who are different than we are.  At the same time, it shows the pain and consequences that come from this thinking and behavior.  We all are perpetrators and we all are victims, in a sense.

2357177,5,B000A3XY5A,"The one thing this films detractors simply cannot abide, or forgive, is the auto wreck rescue scene with Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton.  They either refuse to accept the officers ability to change bigoted attitudes the way he ostensibly does, or they're too offended by what they see as the scenes representation of black dependency on white benevolence.  These are fair objections.  But the refusal to question their assumption about inability to change is a prejudice all its own.  Crash is a film about, more so than anything else, assumptions, and it asks everyone to question two assumptions, about anger and change, with wide-ranging implications for how people get along in the world.

The common assumption about anger says that conflict among people, say racial conflict, triggers fear then anger.  But here are some new premises to consider.  Bear with me--there is a cinematic point here.  Theres a school of thought that says race is a fabrication, a social construct, a piece of fiction created by the mind (to, say, rationalize subjugation).  If one considers that there are virtually no biological differences among humans, that theres only one human species, this thinking is correct.  Its also widely accepted in psychology that there is in life for most people a certain inherent anxiety, a persistent low intensity fear that compels us to look around for threats--an inheritance from thousands of years of evolution (an adaptive function), even if different people today experience that anxiety in different ways.  It follows that perceived threats in the environment (say, for instance, different skin color) can easily trigger that anxiety, then the closely related emotion anger ( anger is the subjective experience that accompanies aggressive impulses. [Averill]), then aggression that may follow.  In other words, people have a built-in anxiety that, in a sense, looks around for threats real or perceived.  Racial difference turns out to be one of those threats, even if a social construct.  The threat intensifies anger (in preparation for aggression).  The anger produces conflict, even if the threat was a perceived one.  So that racial conflict doesnt precipitate anxiety and anger, even if it feels that way.  But rather anxiety and anger predicate the construction of race and then precipitate racial conflict.  Its a massive corruption of the adaptive functions of these emotions, originally intended to keep us safe but now causing conflict.  Different may seem to be the problem, but its really not. The problem isn't on the outside, its on the inside--anxiety and anger.  Thats the Crash.  From anger that becomes crippling, the folks in this film are crashing into their own selves, and they're forced to question their assumption about the origin of their anger  just as the film asks you to question yours.  How Socratic!

Crash involves racism, but it isn't about racism.  Its about anger and change: recognizing the control anger has in our lives (like an addiction) and making a decision to change that, to give it up, to surrender it.  All of the characters are dealing with an unbridled anger which they need to let go of before it destroys them.  We may have to accept the inherent anxiety.  But when the old way of being doesnt work anymore, when theres just too much pain, the anger can be changed, even if an emotional crisis is usually needed to do that.  The inability for this kind of change is the second assumption the film asks you to question.  And the film-makers are making their case that if we question the origin of our anger, we can let go of some of it, allowing people to change both themselves and the way they get along with others.

Theres a spectacular heartbreak to the way these crises are portrayed, especially by Terrence Howard, who is unforgettable.  And theres a real artistry to this film that makes it a both exhilarating and thoughtful rendition of the transformative power of pain.  Full of anguish, defiance, courage, humor, and beauty, Crash is a gorgeous, even if at times difficult, parable about change and hope.  Twelve years after its release, it's clear its Best Picture Oscar was well deserved.  The film may be a bit too much for some.  But for others, its what cinema is all about!  Roger Ebert wrote of this picture, Not many films have the possibility of making their audiences better people.  But when art reaches deep into the viewer and touches both feeling and thought, that art can change people in ways that may last a lifetime.  What nobler purpose is there of art.  Crash is that kind of art.  It acknowledges the mystery of life and, in portraying that mystery so elegantly, helps the viewer make peace with it.  And wouldnt we all eventually like to be able to say, in Pat Conroys beautiful words (from The Prince of Tides), It is the mystery of life that sustains me now.",1456099200,,4873,4.921568627450981

The second half ties into each scenario presented in the first half, so it was worth the wait.  Putting Sandra Bullock's name on this movie was definitely a ploy to draw people to it, as she only appeared a brief handful of times in the movie.  I would call the movie ""strange"" but overall I did like the movie as it was definitely a movie with a message, showing the contrast of the good in people who also had demonstrated prejudice. (For each character who was the object of another's prejudice, their own prejudice was also revealed.)

2357426,1,B000A3XY5A,"Absurdly contrived. Of course, the most disgusting depictions possible are used, and they are dramatized to the hilt. There's no doubt bigotry exists in all racial, ethnic and religious demographics, but most people try to treat others appropriately. This movie portrays people who are obsessed with race. An example at the beginning shows what I mean. Matt Dillon plays a cop who has a medical situation with a family member. He is attempting to get support from someone on the phone who happens to be a black woman. She is unable to help with the situation and he ends up asking for her name, and the woman responds with an obviously ""black woman's"" name. Cop says, ""That figures"", and then takes to the streets and picks up an obviously professional black couple to harass them. He especially takes out his racist obsessions out on the woman as he frisks her and fingers her while taunting the husband. The script also provides a string of disgusting epithets from the woman. Of course racism is real but this movie revels in it. There is no attempt to invoke a discussion of racial matters here. This flick is a wonderful playground for the small minded makers to pull out all the stops and dramatize racism to the hilt. This is not for the purpose of invoking discussion, but to provoke the most base of emotions and agitate.",1452124800,6,1330,4.688034188034188

As I started viewing this film, I felt liberal compassion rise up from the very core of my being. Half an hour into the film, I came close to grasping the true meaning of ""multiculturalism."" Halfway into it, I developed a case of munchies so I decided to have some cheese while enjoying racial diversity. Then, two thirds into the film, I took a restroom break and released noxious stereotypes out of my system. As the movie drew to its finale, I sipped the nectar of tolerance and liberal open-mindedness with great pleasure. Then my white guilt caught up and I choke up....

I was expecting to finish watching it and think to myself, ""Wow, I can't believe that just happened."" But instead, I feel cheated. The suspenseful buildup is gripping, it seems to delve into not only the dark, underbelly of L.A.--and then everything gets tied up with a pretty little bow in the last 10 minutes. This isn't the same portrait of racism as Boyz n the Hood, which leaves with a sense of rage and deep sadness. This is a superficial dish of stereotypical characters who suddenly break out of character in time for a happy ending. No, it was a good movie--perhaps a great movie, but it wasn't phenomenal and won't continue to be talked about 10 years from now as a shocking dose of reality.

The saying goes: ""One bad apple..."" and there goes the neighborhood. Doesn't seem like much has changed in 10 years, and won't until everyone says ""All lives matter, even the 'bad apples'"".

I recommend the movie to everyone.

2357584,3,B000A3XY5A,"This is one of those movies that makes me go ""hmmmm."" It loosely follows a day in the lives of eight main characters as they engage in improbable and highly coincidental encounters with the cruel and unfair, sometimes redeeming streets of LA AND each other, in this Best Picture Oscar winning drama by Paul Haggis. The storyline was at least interesting in spite of its lack of believability. The big problem was what Haggis called the film's ""cartoonish stereotypes,"" which came across unfortunately as outright racist propaganda. We have Sandra Bullock playing the white rich wife of a cheating mayor who is preoccupied with winning the ""black vote"" and who comes to realize that she has no real friends other than the Mexican housekeeper she constantly derides. There's the married black couple who argue over who is
""blacker"" with the wife claiming at least she didn't ""get her blackness from watching the Cosby Show."" We have the idealistic young cop who learns the hard way that's it's just not possible to be fair & just, because altruism doesn't make sense when you're a member of the LAPD. There's the Middle Eastern couple with a doctor daughter who own the token convenience store. Oh and they just happen to be very, how shall we say...careful with money.  There's the Mexican young father with the low paying job who for whatever reason dresses like a gang member although we are never led to believe he ever belonged to any gang.  There's the African-American big shot detective who happens to have a hoodlum- type brother causing his mama many sleepless nights. Then there's the bigot cop who is soured toward other races because his own father ""lost everything"" due to affirmative action. Really these stereotypes just went on and on. Although much of the film was hard to stomach, it did have some redeeming qualities which helped to make it not entirely unlikable. The acting was pretty superb at times and even the convoluted story had it's truly moving moments. That said there is no way this should have won the best picture Oscar, especially over Ang Lee's masterpiece, Brokeback Mountain.",1447977600,6,2111,4.893854748603352

I love how the dynamics of Thandie Newton's role and the prejudiced cop (don't know his name, maybe Matt Dillion?) ""crashed"" and he saved her life after molesting her because of his prejudices. In fact all the characters in this film were excellently played. It was sad that Ryan Phillipe's character succumbed to his prejudices and killed that young man. I found that to be really sad. This is a movie that will make you cry, will cause you to think, and will really seep into your soul. I highly recommend it. You will NOT be disappointed!!",1447804800,15,647,4.491525423728813

If I had, there would have been lots of squealing, face covering, and belabored ""oh my gods."" The acting is mostly strong, but the best part is the interconnectedness between the entire cast. It's difficult to both hate and root for all the characters, but this film works to do so, and is successful. Some characters were not as well developed as others like Thandie Newton and Brendan Frasier.

When he was searching for a weapon by patting the women down, he disrespectfully and inappropriately violated her, and she could hardly contain her anger.

2357703,5,B000A3XY5A,"I watched this movie again after a number of years, and have to say, it seems more relevant than ever.

Crash intertwines stories of disparate lives in LA, united only by distrust based on class, ethnic and racial differences, and brought together by collisions of chance.  Though these fateful encounters are contrived, they don't feel false, thanks to outstanding acting and dialogue, as well as recognition that the characters and circumstances are emblematic of a bigger picture.  No character is wholly bad or good, you come to an understanding of their motivations, and with that, a sense of empathy.  This movie reminds us that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is have heart, and I do believe the world would be a better place if everyone saw this film.",1437782400,,766,4.869230769230769

At times uncomfortable to watch; no one is ALL good, nor ALL bad. This is one of those rare films that will change your life, and how you look at the world, forever.

2357797,2,B000A3XY5A,"While CRASH is most assuredly a technically well-made film, there is absolutely nothing it has to say that couldn't be ascertained from paying a little attention in the real world. Racism is definitely a problem in America (and the world), but all this film seems to have to contribute to that discussion is that it's bad. To make matters worse, every single character in the film is a stereotype. And there's also too many characters to begin with. You learn a little bit about them and their lives, but the running time didn't really allow for a deeper examination of these people and why they are the way they are. All of the performances were good, to be sure, but it was all in service of a heavy-handed script that approaches the issue of racism in the most skin-deep way possible. Despite the film's title, implying a certain degree of chance in one's encounters, every moment in the film felt calculated and calibrated for maximum emotional impact in a way that undermines the seriousness of the issues it wanted to address. At the end, no one really learns anything and, as an audience member, I was left wondering what the point was exactly. From a technical standpoint, though, the film is fairly solid. The movie is about, and (presumably) shot in, LA and the filmmakers did a good job of capturing it on film, especially in the night time. The cinematography was actually kind of beautiful, in contrast to the ugliness of the characters. I'll even give credit to the score for being relatively toned down, letting the rigged emotional stakes of the film stand out that much more. When all is said and done, I'm also left wondering how in the world this shallow nonsense ever won Best Picture. Although well-made and well-acted, it just seems like the Academy gave themselves a pat on the back for even acknowledging that racism exists. The subject deserves better and more thorough treatment than it got with this film.",1425600000,3,1932,4.735905044510385

2357810,5,B000A3XY5A,This is an excellent film that exhibits the emotions shown when people are thrown into frightening or uncomfortable situations. It also shows how prejudice and hate can appear from ignorance and fear. It is extremely well acted by everyone in the film to the point of disturbance but shows that some people do come to the realization that there is good in people they may have believed were prejudice or against them.,1424908800,,417,4.805555555555555

It seems like it's trying to say too much and says almost nothing, or at least nothing we've never heard before. It was ok, but it plays into every racial stereotype out there, while trying to combat stereotypes. It just seemed too sentimental and cliched to be powerful. I can't say that I think it deserved the Oscars it won. At the end of the day, it slid back into so-so territory, in spite of Michael Pena being brilliant.",1422230400,,760,4.435714285714286

2357844,5,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH is an Interesting film on racism, bigotry, stereotypical impressions, behavior, love, anger, kindness, redemption and irony and probably a lot more. But the irony of each happenstance plays out coincidence after coincidence after coincidence. Style over substance? Definitely not. There is style and there is substance. The style is really in the story and the editing which pieces endless events and characters together to see both sides and then see beyond both sides. There is a kaleidoscope of irony that is so thought provoking and as the film progresses and we see the characters confronted with more events that reveal a nature within them that they either know or don't know, recognized or don't recognize. There is growth, there is maturity of self, there are regrets and you take away whatever grabs you on whatever level and perhaps you will return to it and give it some more thought.",1421280000,,902,5.02

2357918,4,B000A3XY5A,"This is a film review of the crime-drama Crash directed by Paul Haggis from 2004. This film shows how it is a problem in every race and every level of income. It tells many different stories that all together have got a relation and form one great exciting story. It starts with two African-American guys, Anthony and Peter who steel the car of the couple Jean, with star-studded cast Sandra Bullock and Rick, the LA district attorney in the film. With this crime the viewer gets the first message of the film and is informed about the conflicts, the film is dealing with. Different skin colour,  level of income and family background.
I like the topic of the film because it is never exhausted and people should be warned to not believe in all prejudices and help to make the relation between white and blacks in America little better. With partly radical and dangerous scenes the viewer gets touched by the story and feeling of each actor. Often you could feel and see the conflict before and it starts to tingle in your fingers because you want to stop characters and prevent catastrophes. In my point of view this is a good and effective way to remember at people that it is possible to prevent problems because sometimes you can presage them or the triggers are pretty obvious. You can find many different ethnicities in `Crash`. The dark-skin characters are African-American and the Caucasians are American or Hispanic and you can also find Persian characters in the film.
If you like love in films, I can tell you that you won't find many typical love scenes in the film. They aren't pretty obvious, but watch carefully  maybe you find some secret love.
It's one of those films that you probably want to watch more than once to to see what you missed the first time in cause of many interconnected scenarios and levels. Eye opening, well written and acted in an often heart breaking and powerful way - this is an excellent film! It is one of those films you can watch over and over and always find it interesting and powerful.",1404777600,,2033,4.613259668508287

2357929,5,B000A3XY5A,"A Persian father is booted out of a gun store in Los Angeles because of a verbal battle with the white all-American shop owner about Bin Laden and 9/11. Farad (played to a tee by the brilliant Shaun Toub) simply wants to defend his small general store against further racial attacks and thieves. His beautiful and sophisticated daughter Darii (played by Bahar Soomekh) steps up the counter to defend her rattled father. She demands bullets for the gun she is going to buy for him and randomly asks for the 'red box' behind him. But the shop owner (a fantastic Jack McGee of ""Rescue Me"") doesnt tell Darii how much bang for your bucks the red ones give. And so a sequence of events begins that will eventually see a child in the arms of her Latino father with his face contorted in agony as he holds her limp body to his chest

Interlocking something like nine different stories into one cohesive unit and then trying to deal with the explosive subject of racism within 'everybody' was always going to be a tall order. So why did Don Cheadle and all the other Hollywood big names believe in it so? Ten minutes into 2004s ""Crash"" and the answer is obvious  the simply stunning script Director Paul Haggis co-wrote with Bobby Moresco.

The dialogue comes at you with a ferocity and brilliance that is in your face in every angry and difficult scene - yet its also loaded with subtle undercurrents of truth about how people really are - and what they really think  on all sides. No one in this movie is clean or perfect or even wrong  most are just good people placed into a cauldron that all too often pushes them to make presumptions and take sides  glaring suspiciously at people from different ethnicities from behind the safety of their metal and glass  voyeurs in a city where no one walks and very few touch each other

Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the District Attorney and his wife  a wealthy woman who wakes up angry every day and doesnt know why anymore (both give blistering performances). Their Lincoln Continental is boosted one night on the Strip by two mouthy black youths constantly arguing about colour and its place in the community (stunning work from Ludacris and Larenze Tate). The DA calls in his assistant to handle the political fall out (""Either I lose the black vote or Im perceived as soft on crime""). But when the blabbering duo run over a Chinaman standing by the door of his locked van because they're not paying attention - it sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually bring one of them back to the van to look at the human cargo chained to the floor in the back

Later that night the corruption-free Detective Graham Waters (a hugely affecting Don Cheadle) is called upon to check on a homicide  the body of a black boy dumped in the grassy scrubs overlooking Hollywood. As he exits his car Graham sighs at his mixed race lover and homicide assistant Ria (fabulous work by Jennifer Esposito) engages in a slagging match with an arrogant Chinese woman whos crashed her car recklessly into the back of someone else (""Maybe your 'blake' lights are broken!"" Ria shouts at her - racially mimicking her bad diction). All this and Grahams mother (Beverly Todd) is never too far away from a needle and his brother AWOL somewhere in the City Of Angels with two strikes and a third warrant that will jail him for 20 years. Also on his mind is an adjacent case of a white cop with a history of shooting black men and getting away with it  the trigger-happy William Lewis found with $300,000 hidden in a tyre in his trunk. But then back at the scene on the hillside  Detective Graham Waters freezes as he recognizes something about the bloodied body

Earlier that day Officer John Ryan and his rookie partner (Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe) enter their squad car for another weary round of confrontations. A 17-year veteran of the city beat - John Ryan appears to be a racist cop who cant get a break for his aging father whose living with him  Dad battling a urinary tract infection that makes his nights a draining physical agony. His younger more idealistic partner despises Ryans remarks and abuse of power  none more so  than when they stop a well-to-do Black TV Director and his beautiful wife (Terence Howard and Thandie Newton as Cameron and Christine Thayer) on Ventura Boulevard driving a car that is similar to the one reported as stolen from the white DA. There ensues a hands-on search that sees Ryan become far too friendly with whats beneath Christines cocktail dress. She cringes as her black husband apologises and appeases the wholly unnecessary humiliation. They scream at each other at home and he boils inside on set - as everything seems to be bringing out the street thug in him that he left behind decades ago

A Latino father (Michael Pena) who works as a Locksmith tries to comfort his 5-year old daughter Lara who is hiding under her bed because of bang-sounds she heard in the darkness outside. He tells her that they moved to this better neighbourhood to get away from those bullet-things  and better still  Dad has a magical cloak given to him by a fairy when he was a child that he must now pass on to her. Its 'impenetrable' Dad tells her  she smiles as he clips it around her. Lara will use it later (dialogue above) to jump in the path of a bullet when Farad uses his gun in a moment of madness  having found a receipt in a dumpster for the Latino man he believes cheated him by not fixing his lock properly

The cast is magnificent  especially the women  both Bullock and Newton going to places they found horrible and unsettling. Loretta Devine, Nona Gaye, Karina Arroyave, Marina Sirtis, Beverly Todd, Alexis Rhee and Ashlyn Sanchez as Lara  they are all so good.

I wish I could say the BLU RAY print is a marvel  far from it. The Director and DOP decided on hand-held shots a lot of the time to give vibrancy and capture the differing shades of Los Angeles. And as a lot of the scenes are either at night or in the enclosed spaces of homes  the grain is terrible. When it gets to the daylight and open surroundings  it looks gorgeous  but thats only every now and then. Having said that  this is not a film where you're looking for visual perfection  it has you too riveted for that.

Audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital, DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 and Subtitles are English For The Hard Of Hearing. Extras include a feature-length commentary by Director Paul Haggis, Don Cheadle and Bobby Moresco, Deleted Scenes, ""Behind The Metal And Glass  Making of Crash"", ""L.A.  The Other man Character"", ""Unspoken"" Featurette. The extras show how Don Cheadles initial interest and standing in the acting community brought such A-Listers on board  it also features detailed discussion on characters and the difficulties in the script by Producer by Cathy Schulman. Mark Isham also compliments the movie with a wonderful score.
The movie is dedicated to Anita Addison  a TV and Film Producer and Lifelong Friend of Paul Haggis who died in 2004.

There are exchanges between characters in ""Crash"" that are so cutting edge and bristling with rage and anger  that its sometimes a hugely uncomfortable watch  and that is part of the point. It isn't perfect by any means  some of it feels a bit too preachy - and after all the preceding excellence  I felt it ended rather poorly.

But there is also humanity and redemption  the scene where Matt Dillon pulls Thandie Newton from an upturned burning car is one of the most charged and yet tender I have ever seen (career bests for both).

Winner of Three Academy Awards including Best Picture  ""Crash"" is properly great filmmaking.

I admired how ambitious it was and the performances are fantastic, but it's so melodramatic that it becomes hard to take serious and at times just frustrating to watch. The subject matter here is interesting, but it's handled in such a preachy and pretentious way. To make matters worse, the film doesn't really go anywhere by the end of it's nearly 2 hour runtime and ultimately feels rather pointless.

2357950,1,B000A3XY5A,"Wow, what an amazing movie. This wasn't just your regular movie. It was an *Important* movie, because it teaches you things. Mostly things that you probably never knew.

For instance, from watching this movie I learned that Racism is BAD. I know, right? Who would have thought? But yeah, it was cool to realize that.

Another thing I learned is that everyone in the world is secretly a racist bigot. Seriously, all of us are total jerks when it comes to anyone not the same race as us. If you think you're not, then you just haven't realized it yet. You just wait. Sooner or later, something will happen that will prove what a complete bigot you are. You're probably a homophobe and vegetarian hater too - you just don't know it yet! This movie knows way more about human nature than you do. Don't question its incredible insight into human nature. Just accept that this is the way we all are. We all hate each other. Stop saying you don't hate others and just roll with it, because this movie knows best.

The other thing I learned, which kind of goes with the second thing, is that since all other people are racist jerks, they are not to be trusted. Remember that Chinese guy you ran over the other day? (Yeah, happens a lot, I know.) Don't feel too sorry for him, because he was probably involved in human trafficking or some other such business. And that lady whose car got stolen? Don't worry about her - after all, she's mean to her maid. Kinda had it coming, really.

Speaking of which, I thought Sandra Bullock's acting skill in this movie was really impressive. I wouldn't have thought it possible for her to maintain the same angry, unlikeable face over the course of the entire movie. But she pulled it off flawlessly. She kind of reminded me of the wife from Everybody Loves Raymond, minus any jokes.

Also, Counselor Troi was in this movie. She looked kinda hot in a head scarf, just sayin'.

It was cool to see Ludacris in this movie. At one point, his character launched into a monologue about the evils of rap music. I know... IRONY, am I right? (But he never did rap at all, so I've gotta knock 4 stars off my rating for this movie for that alone. If he had busted a rhyme in Sandra's face I woulda been totally on board with that, yo!)

Also, this movie featured a car crash. Hence the title, ""Crash"".

My only hope is that this movie will make a real difference in society. Such to the point that one day, all people in America will have equal rights. That all minorities will be able to vote. And that mixed marriages will be 100% legal. Yeah, yeah... I know that's a long way off but we can all dream, right?",1392595200,5,2630,4.397119341563786

This movie brings a realistic and heartbreaking perspective on the effects of the pain we humans bring upon one another.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is *not* a guilt trip for white people. Racism is a global phenomenon. One ""race"" is not more guilty of it than another.

2357983,2,B000A3XY5A,"This movie was very moving. And considering I lived at the time in California my home turf, now in Texass ( extra A well deserved and yes, guess why?)
First, make note to self, don't take a course online and paid for with a Teacher ( college level, no, doesn't deserve to be called ""professor"" but a few other names come to mind!) She stated no where when signing up you would be required to watch two movies when buying your books! Surprise! Paid for class in July, states contact her for syllabus, i do, she states it will be given out later. Um okay I guess?  So, I ask, anyone and everybody where is this movie? The answers I got back where too funny, because someone stated at your library, okay, note to self and to others.""this is Texass, where the drop out rate is 50% for high school students, teen pregnancy, same amount. So yes, Rick Perry has proven you ain't needing any department of educatishun, why, all you need is a couple of guns and a bible and ya'll be fine! Of course, because we can then work low paying jobs, women can earn less then men, as he signed into law, and don't be fooled by that basket case Ted Cruz who stood up drinking water ( depends? Catheter? ) only followed one Woman in this state Wendy Davis.
Well, teachers response, ""it is on netflix"" my response, no it is not on netflix so any other location?!no reply but a very harsh grade of a ""zero"" for 2 reasons: I related the movie to the book in the fact that there are still prejudices that exists in L.A. And gave an example. But really, we truly do need to understand that many do. I am not sleep walking, but my thing is this; I have lived in, been in, many different places in this country including Hawaii. Of course, when we moved here, I stated no way will I live in this lying hell hole of a state forever! Oh yes I did say that! Now, understand this, when you are a person who was military, who lived amongst many diverse cultures and experiences, I do not need a teacher telling me I have no clue. And also my views carried a note of political overtones and that is not social work.  I think she lives on Pluto, after attending the MDHA which was giving us the new ""FEDERAL GUIDELINES"" for social services, um, yeah, that is some politics!  And just FYI, when when we have ""Civil Servants"" who wish to take Federal Programs Away, Cut Social Security or get their hands on it which Roosevelt was a smart man to allow that not to happen, it ain't broke, so don't touch it! But those who wish to hold a government hostage and get a six figure pay, worked together to get the FAA back up to speed for their self serving and as they feel deserving recess to go home.,
Yes, after my rather lengthy diatribe, I will say this; since the incident of Rodney King L.A. Is by far better than the Dallas PD which just FYI I was in my first car wreck with an""off duty"" cop, who I give my info to, as stated by law we are to trade no matter fault, 7 of his buddies show up and treat me like I was some escaped convict. 4 days later my Uncle passes away, back to California I go, thank the Heavens for fresh air, really would enjoy going back their, we shall see. I bring up the DPD because I was getting a nook taken care of, well known at my local Barnes and noble, and the young woman asked me if I reported the incident, I said no, my plate has been super full. She stated, ""the Dallas PD is so corrupt she would never work for them, she did as a student and just finished her bachelors in criminal science.""  So, yes. The cop in his 6figure Mercedes when asked by one of his buds, he stated, yeah my wife's car, sure whatever.
The movie does depict some of the racial divide in certain areas of this country, Texass being one, as they actively stop Hispanics even though they maybe from South America!  Same with African Americans, they too face this issue. So what was the point of this movie? Does racial prejudices exists with everyone? Certain states or areas? That is the question only each person you can answer when you look in the mirror and see who you are, what you believe, how you were brought up, and then decide whether to be pro-active regarding you, or not. Today I sat next to a man who was not from here but here for two years only. I get it, he stated exactly how I feel, "" to me, I see a human being first, and that is it!"" Yes, do we need to understand other cultures? Of course. But you have to make a decision in regards to the viewing of this movie, because it is basically pointing out how often people prejudge on looks alone without even getting to know the person first. Suggestion, do not allow your companies to move to Texas. Because now, ""the bible"" will be taught in school, my thoughts? Then by all the Goddesses teach all other views on beliefs as well!

2357985,4,B000A3XY5A,"This movie is well done for the most part. Though it is fragmented in the beginning and a little confusing even after it's finished, in the end most of the movie comes together to make sense. There are a couple/few questions that I don't think were answered though - I could tell the scenes were out of order, but even keeping this in mind, I still can't figure out who was in the other car, or how the crash happened. I know those things aren't what the movie's really about, but the answers not being there kind of bugs me (maybe they are there and I just don't remember, I don't know).

This is a movie about racism/prejudices and about how one person can make a big difference for others. I highly recommend it to you if you are interested in these topics.

The movie itself is actually good. The situations found here are a lil bit out the norm (meaning that it wouldnt be something a normal person encounters every day). The plot is also a tad convoluted, you care more about some characters than others.

Even I, who do not believe in racism or judging anyone based on religion, ethnicity, culture, etc...found myself thinking for a few seconds if I didn't superficially feel the same as some characters...But the ones who hated this movie, missed 'the big picture' (Pun intended!)...Where do we begin to judge someone...and if someone is a disgusting human being in one aspect of his life, is he to be judge solely for this--or is there more to a person.  The movie in general goes beyond race...it's about humanity. Period.  No one is always good or bad...we're just a bunch of lost souls thrown into a world without the proper knowledge on how to deal with our own species...Watch it--it's ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"" (shakespeare)---but in the end, it's the story of all of us...",1367539200,,1002,4.8882352941176475

2358100,4,B000A3XY5A,"A coworker lent me this DVD and I watched it, not knowing what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised as the stories unfolded, and enjoyed it enough to watch it again the next day (you know how you always pick up more the second time around...). The assumptions we make of each other are not solely cross-racial but even based on appearance and age. How often we forget that looking the part isn't the same as acting the part.

A middle-aged woman who dresses provocatively in public - is she sleazy, or does she suffer from low self-esteem and feels this is the only way she'll be appreciated?

Someone who is well-dressed, drives an expensive car, wears expensive jewelry, etc.  Is s/he rich, or desperately in debt, trying to appear rich?

A youth who wears loose pants and a backward ballcap - is he a criminal, or just trying to fit-in at school so he won't get bullied like all the other smart kids?

Personally, thanks to my job, I tend to notice teenage boys/young men in the street and assume they're up to no good. I even got a part-time job with teens to remind myself that not all youth are bad. It worked. There are plenty of good kids out there.

This movie reminds us that despite the way a person looks and all your previous history with ""their kind"", the person's skin colour, clothing, way of speaking, etc. does not define who they are. Our behaviour defines us - and that IS something we can control.

I sometimes point the frown of judgment back on myself and try to imagine what others assume of my character, based on my job, the way I dress, etc.  Chances are that they're quite wrong.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars but only because of the lengthy non-speaking shots where the camera flicks from one scene to another with mood music playing. I don't dislike that in general, but I ended up fast-forwarding a couple of times because it went on too long.",1366502400,,1877,4.461988304093567
2358101,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a great movie with an outstanding ensemble cast.  Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Larenz Tate, Ludicris, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon, and Terrence Howard are really magnificent and are all worth the price of admission.  The continuing ironies and the way the characters interact certainly is intriguing.  The film certainly shows many aspects of racism in L. A. The movie is pretty heavy and does not have hardly any comedic parts to it.

I could not designate anyone as the actual star of this film.  In the previous paragraph, I forgot to mention Ryan Phillippe who I was not familiar with when I saw this film in the theater.

The best parts of the movie to me, were when Terrence Howard protected Ludicris from the police and also, when Sandra Bullock fell down the steps in her home and the only person who was there to comfort her in the hospital was the Mexican housekeeper that the Bullock character had maligned earlier in the film.  These touches of irony certainly make this a film worth watching more than once.

2358113,2,B000A3XY5A,"Almost ten years have gone by since I first saw this, and the time hasn't been kind to this film.  It is preachy, too convenient in its coincidences, and tiresome -- every scene seems to turn melodramatic and hateful. The words are all bulldozers, when in real life they are more like poison darts. And it is obvious now how unoriginal it was, with its episodic plot, angels, and surprises falling from the sky.  Been there, done that -- nothing new learned here. Even the racism -- seemingly the through-line for all of the episodes -- comes across as false and put on in the forms that director Haggis uses here.

In a word it is baroque.  Overly ornamented with flourishes that provide no new creative insights, just swirls of melodrama. When Ludacris' discovers the Asian refugees in the van he, like we, are right to ask: come on now, WTF?!

Still, the actors are all incredible, every single one from leads to cameos. In fact, they take mediocre material (at best) and make it moving at times. Sure, the film falls apart in the last half hour into a swampy pile of mush, with an accompanying mushy soundtrack.  But you can't forget Bullock clinging to her maid -- her only real friend, or Newton and Dillon struggling to break free of the burning car, or the look on Tate's face after he reaches for his lucky saint Christopher.  I wish someone would write and direct a more realistic film about racism in all its real subtleties and complexities, and hire all these fine actors again.",1365033600,2,1491,4.582706766917293

Racism--which is mostly covert, unrecognized and yet still pervasive in our culture--does not, on average, involve pretty housewives screaming ""I HATE ORIENTALS!!!"" every ten minutes. There are people like this, of course. But racism is usually not overt, and is therefore much more problematic. This film's cast of caricatures seem like they were created by a true simpleton. Maybe something the boys of South Park would come up with as a report for their teacher Mr. Garrison.

And in the end, it snows in L.A.

Every story is perfectly crafted to exact a cheap emotional response. Corruption, Racism, Greed, all the hot button topics are touched upon to provoke you. If that was not enough, every character is an easily detected stereotype. Which is confusing when the message of the movie is people are more complex than two-dimensional automatons.

Although the film is set in Los Angeles, it could be any town because we still have a long way to go toward defeating racism, racial profiling, gender profiling, and hatred in our culture. No race is immune from prejudice and no amount of personal success one achieves will get him or her past that prejudice once one steps out onto the street. In this film, a black woman is just another hooker, her successful director husband just another black to be bullied at will. Police are not immune to personal prejudice and even more vile at exploiting their power. I recommend this film to mature teens and adults.

I suspect if you like racially fueled movies then you will love this one because its all about the bias in America .  When I watch a movie I want to be entertained not schooled in one persons ideal of what is right/wrong and hope for a happy ending that never comes from lessons learned.  That's not a spoiler alert, because it implies the movie has a happy ending, far from it.  It's an impossible movie to rate for someone else to watch because you never know what a strangers politics are, so watch for yourself and decide.

If you are considering renting  this movie because of Sandra Bullock's top billing, be forewarned that her role is more cameo than main character and not one of her best performances.

2358259,4,B000A3XY5A,"On the surface this movie may seem like it's about racism but on a deeper level, it makes us think about something else. None of us know how or why we came to be here. We could be a cop, a thug, a maid, a smuggled slave, a struggling refugee, or the rich wife of a powerful attorney.  While we may not be in control of where we end up in life, we are in control of how we can respond to a situation, regardless of our skin color, race, or position in life. Everyday we get a new chance to make choices and if we choose to have compassion and act out of kindness, perhaps, just maybe perhaps, we can make this world less evil, and know that we have made a difference in someone's life.

Things are not at all what they appear to be. Against a backdrop of LAPD corruption and profiling of blacks, the lives of the characters, white, black, Asian and Hispanic unfold and intersect in multi-layered ways that to some may seem contrived. The movie, however, succeeds brilliantly on the strength of the excellent performances by its certified stars (Terrence Howard in particular) as it peels back the layers of racial and social stereotypes. But make no mistake, this is no morality tale and, without giving anything away, characters are revealed in all their human complexity and through its twists and turns the drama turns on their head our notions of good and evil, racist and enlightened.

2358264,5,B000A3XY5A,"Being a fairly conservetive person, I tend to have my ""radar"" on for the type of propaganda film making that is on today's market, but I don't think the movie attempted to convey these things at all. The point of the film was to demonstrate the complexities of racism. This was well demonstrated my Matt Dillon's character, just to name one example. Dillion played a character that had depth and complexity, not simply a cop-out stereotype. I also felt that the film did an outstanding job avoiding stereotypes and demanded thought from the viewer. Crash also didn't attempt to offer up a singular group/race verses another. In the end, I felt Crash succeeded in that effort.

I have read a number of reviews that mention that the film had unrealist, contrived situations. My view on this is that while that may be true, it would be the only way to take on the subject on a macro level. Films like Brokeback are designed to take on a racist point of view on a particular subject. Crash, rather than drill down on a singular situation, attempts take on the racism on a broad spectrum basis. As for too many sub-plots...I think that was in fact the point. My only issue with Crash relates to how the film dealt with redemption. There is a darkness there that I don't associate with redemption. If it were possible to take away a half star, that is where it would be for me.",1359417600,,1371,4.528225806451613

If the point of the movie was to show just how prevalent racism is, I think many already know that. Would like to see more positive instead of portraying the negative we already know.

Even though he's in his 20s and lives in LA.  I think that scene pretty much sums up how ridiculous this movie is.  Whoever wrote this movie couldn't have possibly witnessed racism in real life.  Every scene feels like they're guessing at what would PROBABLY happen in a situation because of course, EVERYONE is a racist.  So if it's a white person and black person, oh the white person is DEFINITELY going to call the black person a N*****.  Right?  This movie is a joke.  Avoid.

2358279,1,B000A3XY5A,"Sick & Stupid Score: 9/8*

After watching this movie, you will understand why everyone hates Los Angeles, even the ""people"" who live there.  You will also understand why there are so many horror, sci-fi, and disaster movies concerning the destruction of Los Angeles:  Everyone wants to see it burn or fall into the ocean, because everyone knows it is the cesspit of America.

The Hollywood elites have done us a great service with this movie by inadvertently showing us the abysmal failure of affirmative action, equal opportunity, multicultural diversity, and out-of-control immigration.  For that, the movie deserves five stars.

Otherwise, this film is trash.

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

2358281,5,B000A3XY5A,"For those who have watched this movie, and have been hyper-critical, I get it:  sometimes a film must take some literary license to elevate a moral issue or point so it can be seen through the eyes of everybody watching the movie.  So, if you feel the movie is ""contrived"" or ""not-realistic"", you're right.  BUT, to the point, this movie about prejudices, racism, and the dysfunctionality of America's melting pot, by using modern-day Los Angeles as the backdrop, does, in my opinion an outstanding job of reinforcing the concept that, together, we are stronger than if we're divided.  I think the movie does an outstanding job of showing racism, prejudice, and how we, as people, can learn from those mistakes--how anger driving us to the point of killing one another is the real culprit.

Life is hard.  We all struggle.  But when you blame those struggles on race, you have to take a step back, look, and listen to what life is trying to teach us.

2358300,5,B000A3XY5A,"Intense is the word for this film - be ready for intense.
The cast steps up to this production with invested, gut-level feeling and excellence in theatrical art.  (truly)  I think this film - with so many plots and characters - would otherwise be very hard to pull off, and could easily just turn out campy or worse.  but it DOESN'T.  This is a cinematic triumph most every mature American should see: good story-telling.  Very compelling stories, many different forms of racism are shown - and in a complex manner; very true and common and extraordinary circumstances, and very detailed relationships.

One thing I love about this film is that good guys will be lifted up in one scene, and show their own racism or darkness in the next: the movie does NOT aim for some black-and-white conviction about who is bad and who is good; it is a message on how pervasive and damaging racism is - among other things.  Good guys do good things, and bad things, and bad guys do good things...and bad things.  I think this movie is a well-told perspective on racism, and is valuable (no, really - it's invaluable) to the discussion of/effort to heal racism.  MANY good questions come out of this film - and not just about racism.  You see violence, drugs, crime and crime mentality, metacommunication about racism, sexuality (I'd say in a healthy way!!), abuse in it's many forms, fear, traumatic experiences, families in crisis and the family bond, poverty, slavery, law enforcement, mistakes, bureaucracy and the temptations to sell-out and bend principles -etc.

Be ready to cry, and to just sit quiet for a good while afterward - and make sure the room is distraction free.  The film demands respect.  And I'm glad to say that the movie will leave you feeling like the world is full of beautiful people who need to be loved, and that humanity is truly supposed to be a wonderful thing - this is NOT a disparaging discourse on the wrongs of man kind.  But it is a good HARD look.  You should see it.

*duty to warn (small spoiler alert): if you have sexual trauma, violence, or even just crisis/trauma in your life-story, either be ready for this to trigger you pretty hard, or just don't try it.  Several scenes have stuck with me for years (no trauma history), and one scene of a police frisking becoming a sexual molestation is very salient.",1352851200,,2336,4.658536585365853

2358302,5,B000A3XY5A,"Movies that do what Crash does are incredibly rare. Movies that do it exceptionally well are virtually non-existent. So let me tell you what it does. It examines the life of several characters from very different cultures in America. There isn't really a ""main"" character because they are all important. That's the first point. There is no antagonist. Almost every character is loveable at least part of the time. Sometimes they are victims of racism and just when you start to feel bad for them they do or say something racist. That's my favorite part of this movie. There is a duality to every person and this movie illustrates that perfectly. The point of the movie is not to say that people who do or say racist things sometimes are all bad all the time and you should hate them. Rather, it shows how nearly everyone; rich, poor, minority, majority, professional, or criminal sometimes do or say racist things. It hurts people"". It doesn't even try to make you feel like a bad person for doing these things and it doesn't try to convince you to stop. Not directly, anyway. It does this by making you feel for the characters and sympathize with them so that you feel the sting of blind, irrational prejudice.

This is a Great movie. Packed with vinettes of realities from dark and

The scene at the crash between Thandie Newton and Matt Dillon still beings
tears to my eyes whenever I think of it and what it was saying. WOW, they
must be so proud to have put that on screen so well.
It will make you uncomfortable at times but it can leave you a better person,
if you get the many points of this film.
Sandra Bullock is in it but barely. her tiny role is almost a throw away.
but the moment she tells her Spanish Housekeeper,at a very low time in her life,
that she is the best and only friend she has, drives home another point, so sad but true.
count on many of those moments but do pay attention, a lot is being said quickly.
I read the 2 poor reviews here on amazon and can hardly believe what they said.
This movie is a MUST SEE movie. I guess if your life experiences are limited
you may not GET some of what is being put forth in this film. If you are not
a movie Buff to the extent you realize it is just a movie and in that an art form,
then again you may underrate it.
But it makes you think, feel, reflect,gives hope,insight and a wider perspective than you
may of had before seeing the film. it may even make you a better person.

2358306,4,B000A3XY5A,"It was not a bad movie, overall.  The storylines were very short because there were so many leaving room for the viewer to make inferences and assumptions about the character's backgrounds and personalities beyond those tied to the situations.  Also the movie made several subtle implications as to the true nature and intentions of some of the characters, but few if any had any confirmations.  One example is the detective's mother- was she a drug adddict/alcoholic or did she have a psychological problem, or both?  Another would be the DA, his passing glance of reluctance at his assistant after he told his wife he loved her- was it a look of guilt at being angry with his wife, was it the glance of ""sorry not tonight"" regarding an affair, or was it an apologetic look because of the racial rampage his wife had gone on the night their car was stolen.  I did like how it covered almost all racial stereotypes, leaving basically nothing out.  Also, much of the racial profiling and stereotypes were misguided and based on general ignorance to different types of cultures (i.e.: Chinese vs. Asian and Mexican vs. Latino/a as a whole).

There were a lot of storylines and not much background, but the movie definitely got the point across.  I liked it, and would recommend it to others.

I just remember that it was a movie i never saw when it first came out and after all the years and talk from critics, friends and family members i decided it was time i watched it. A few minutes into the movie, it became quite obvious that it is centered on one topic and thats racism. How every person or persons in this movie no matter there color is basicly a racist in some small or large way. They pretty much covered every color or ethnicity. Im not going to delve into the story or characters just to say that you should definitly watch this movie at least once. What i took from this movie was that even a man like myself who is a Christian and generally treats people the way i would want to be treated, has at times said or thought racist things. I was disgusted in that moment and a little emotional but it made me realize that i can still better myself and i hope others well do the same.

detailed are symptomatic of what's plagueing cities across north america,and well run cities like any large businessman will tell you is what makes cities enjoyable and also brings wealth. I recall years ago seeing sandra bullock captioned on a variety of media outlets and i must say here her performance is all too good, of course i shouldnt be surprised but i was for some reason at what a good actess and good performance she turns in. The film is about media tensions and profiling and in one early scene which typifies what's wrong in city life she tees off at her d.a. husband about gangs chasing them,which may be the result of her d.a. husband and who he associates and where there contration in the city lies....very good scene. The car scenes and crash hark back to an early david cronenberg film,and also in one scene where a woman is cupped by an officer,showing racinal tensions between officer and husband,and showing attachment disorders in investigators. Later this same officer goes to all extents,rescuing woman from capsized car,but he really doesnt do anything for the guy and it is the woman who caused sexual disorder
in car. These are very complex scenes set up,of a relationship of three people which goes way off base. There is also a scene near end of film of killed officer,innocent man being framed,and then scenes with sandra bullock at film's end falling apart angry at world and spouse and not being able to make sense of life...but does this make any sense. Interesting note in arguement between black couple they bring up,the show cosby show. This was a black show typifying white life which was why though very popular not many people liked it,or saw it as not really typifying the reality of black life,and its spinoff was it ""a life of one's own"" i'm not sure. The problem with the film is the city is in a mess since they often aid the wrong people,for a large variety of reasons not only racism,or
expectations and constructs.

The key to understanding so much in film,and this film,is the good performance by sandra bullock which let me
see many things,and where the actual problems in this city are,a film that works on many levels,a film of los angeles
but probably typical of many cities,and the stars talk of being around chicago and new york. I have underated her as a performer based on her physical features and all that media but i seldom enjoyed good acting like hers,which a commentator actually mentioned.",1337817600,,2792,4.697959183673469

2358321,5,B000A3XY5A,"For those who think that this movie is just saying, ""Hey, racism is bad,"" they are truly missing the point.  If CRASH has a message, it would be something like ""Racism is complicated"" or ""Racism is inescapable"" or ""Racism isn't only for white folks.""  But even those ideas fall short.  CRASH is less a message film than a character study writ large.  It presents a number of characters from various racial and class backgrounds, and then lets them develop before the audience's eyes.  None of the characters is simple.  No matter how flat or one-sided they may seem to be at any point in the film, each is given one or more moments to change unexpectedly and show additional facets to their personality.

Sandra Bullock's character is a perfect example.  If there was ever any doubt that Bullock could do ""serious"" work as well as she does screwball comedy, this film easily dispels it.  Bullock's character seems to fall too easily into the stereotype of the upper-class racist WASP, leveling prejudice at any minority who crosses her path. She is utterly dislikable; in fact, that is the point.  Bullock, along with Matt Dillon's character, are set up early to be the film's idealogical villains.  But as the narrative progresses, we see these characters in greater depth, with new contexts.  Just as the films ""heroes"" begin to show weaknesses and moral failings, the ""villains"" gain potentially noble traits.  By the time we get near the end of the film and witness Bullock clutching at her housekeeper and confessing her lonliness, we can feel the sadness of her limited life.  We don't have to like her, and most viewers probably won't but ""liking"" her or not again misses the point.  The point is that life isn't so easily divided into heroes and villains.

We all have blind spots and prejudices.  We all have the capacity for nobility, and for debasement.  We all struggle for connection and to be understood.  CRASH insists that every one of its characters be seen at their best and at their worst.  It doesn't solve anything, or even offer ideas for a solution; that's why CRASH isn't really a message film.

2358326,1,B000A3XY5A,"This movie is, to say the least, preachy. It wants to get a lesson across. But what lesson? And why do we need that lesson?  ""Crash"" comes across as an R-Rated version of the sensitivity movies kids are exposed to in middle-school social studies classes.  Intelligent adults should find this movie offensive as it rouses more controversy than necessary, treats the audience like the didn't already realize these things, and takes isolated incidents and makes them look like universals of which we are all guilty of having a part.  Only an idiot would be ""enlightened"" by this ""Crash"".

All the scenarios in ""Crash"" are of the cookie-cutter variety.  Phony institutional racism, phony thugs, phony housewives, phony baloney everything.  Trust me when I say Sandra Bullock has never taken part in anything that should be taken for more than cheap entertainment.  I remember the part when the old Iranian woman says, ""Since when are Persians Arabs?"".  Ok, I get her point, but nobody would ever exclaim that point out-loud in such a way.  All that line really said to me was, ""Hey, audience, if you didn't know, some people from the mid-east are Persian.  If you think they are all Arab's, you're a racist"".  Also unbelievably lame was the part when the little girl doesn't get shot because there were blanks in the gun.  This is like a bad ending to a made-for-TV movie. I can't believe such a cornball cop-out could be featured in the best picture.  In real life, there aren't twists of fate where the little girl doesn't die because there were blanks in the gun.  In real life the girl DOES get shot and she DIES. That would really get a message across.

Do you ever think that the main reason people are so concerned with not being racist and being politically correct is because the media propagates this message that there is an ether or bigotry everywhere?  Almost like the only way to not be a racist is to make sure you watch plenty of TV and Hollywood films so that you know how to act and what to say.  Racism will NEVER die.  Until we are all the same shade of grey there will always be ignorant racists.  This movie is a decade late in spreading a message that everybody already got.  I grew up all over the world (foreign country, big cities, small towns, big states and little islands) and I can honestly say that the most I've experienced racism is when I see it fictionalized on TV or in the movies (please do not take that as me saying I've never experienced it directly, I have, it's not pretty, but I usually pass it off as ignorance and refuse to take it for anything other than some idiot who can't evolve).

2358329,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is quirky and very contrived, although I can see how it might have some fans.  Packs an emotional punch (if you put your brain on hold), as the director touches a bunch of melodramatic buttons.  It's amazingly race-obsessed.  The theme is, I guess, some cliche like ""Can't we all just get along?""  or ""I'd like to see the world at one, in perfect harmony...""  After we get over our nasty prejudices, let's all just love each other and sing Kumbaya.

It has two themes that it hits over and over:  race (good & bad blacks, good & bad whites, hispanics, Iranians), and police.  Every other actor is a policeman or a DA.  They all have conflicts with each other, then they all end up loving one another's humanity.  A bit too thick with the syrupy ""COEXIST"" message.

I really can't see how it won an Oscar, except maybe that the field was weak that year (2006).  It's way too contrived.  Example: the racist, abusive cop feels up an upper-class black woman in a traffic stop and humiliates her and her husband.  Then he later saves her life in a traffic accident.  OK.... Her husband then is car-jacked by two (way too nice) armed black thugs, but he gets away and disarms them by himself (Yeah, right) .... then the racist cop's nice-guy partner saves HIM from a potentially fatal police shooting by other white cops. Sure!

The film seems obsessed with black men who have become educated and successful, dealing with their conflicts in ""losing their blackness"" or ""becoming too white.""  It also seems sometimes to be copying Pulp Fiction in showing some of the seemy side of LA, the thugs talking philosophy in the car, etc.

Not to say that there aren't good scenes.  Like the very first scene where the two thuggish-looking young black guys come out of a coffee shop in a toney white area, complaining that everyone is avoiding them and giving them attitude.  Then, when they come across a well-dressed white couple, they immediately pull out guns and carjack them!

But in general it's a contrived, awkward, second-tier script with a star-studded cast (Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, etc).",1297555200,2,2096,4.7032967032967035

2358332,4,B000A3XY5A,"(possible spoiler alert!)

Crash is Paul Haggis' film directorial debut (he wrote the script as well), and he apparently has no desire to enter lightly. Good for him. Like Magnolia, American Graffiti, and Short Cuts before him, Haggis has created a mosaic of multiple, thematically related sub-plots which, while seemingly running independent of one another, eventually collide (crash) as the film progresses through the course of a 1-2 day period. Owing a large debt to Spike Lee (conscious'lee' or otherwise), Haggis has crafted the most provocative American film on race/culture relations since 1989's Do The Right Thing. Thankfully, like Lee, while Crash is not wholly devoid of hope, Haggis offers no easy answers, no preaching, no clear formula to follow toward resolution, and lays no clear blame; or lays blame everywhere - however you want to read it.

The film is not a perfectly mirrored image of our society; nor need it be. Nevertheless, his film does intentionally share many defining traits with its subjects: our country and the prejudices between our races and cultures. Here's the short list of their shared traits: aggressive, messy, near-great, funny, necessary, dangerous, at once generous and demanding, beautiful, overly ambitious, frustrating, well-intentioned, and above all - ambiguous and unresolved.

Crash is seemingly an easy film to discredit and many simply don't like the film. Its detractors decry manipulative and contrived plot turns and coincidences, or characters that are too consistently racist and thoughtless, and that this doesn't represent a true cross-section of our peoples' attitudes. Many see the film as a crass simplification. But it's not a simplification. It's an amplification. Subtle tactics (or doing nothing) don't seem to make much progress against our country's racial, cultural, and class divisions. So Haggis has decided to take much poetic license and exaggerates (amplifies) certain things out of proportion so that acknowledgement of the situation is unavoidable. And, yes, on a couple occasions the action is 'forced' into dramatically 'convenient' directions. Again, much seems to be borrowed from Do The Right Thing: extreme characters, intentional overuse of racial epithets, music as character (""Fight The Power"" from Lee, and Country music from Haggis), and condensed time and place providing a heightened feeling of immediacy.

Whether you allow the 'forced' conflicts to distract you from the dramatic intensity, larger issues, and the film's many strengths depends on your ability to suspend disbelief and your willingness to allow different techniques to lay beside one another in service of the same story. The great writer Tim O'Brien makes the crucial distinction between what he calls ""story truth"" and ""happening truth"". His idea is that often a well crafted story of fiction (by definition imagined; not real) can give the reader a deeper understanding of the reality of a situation than just listing the facts of what ""happened."" Haggis believes in story truth as well. Somewhat like David Lynch (in concept, not style) Haggis intentionally creates scenarios in which, while they may be somewhat fantastical, allow him to get at the 'reality' of things which are usually hidden in real life: secret lives, suppressed rage, hidden psychological pressures and undercurrents. Of course, you can get at these same issues in a more consistently naturalistic setting as well. It's a conscious stylistic choice. And for the difficult material and high aims Haggis set up for himself with this project, all involved should be proud for how successful the film has turned out.

At its heart, the film is about mistaken identities, miscommunications, and their consequences. A man mistakes his girlfriend for being Mexican (she isn't); A gun store owner mistakes two Persian customers for being Arab, referring to one of them as 'Osama' when he becomes agitated from not understanding their language; A woman who's having the locks changed at her home doesn't trust the man changing them because he's got what she refers to as 'prison' tattoos and looks like he may be a Mexican 'gang-banger' (he's not); Two different parents attribute life altering deeds to people they rarely see (or don't even know) instead of to the people that are closest to them.

The film also boasts ensemble acting at its highest level. All the actors here give uniformly fine, tempered, empathetic performances consistently neutralizing any occasionally perceived heavy-handed dialogue or plot turn. Many point to Don Cheadle (deserved actor of the moment) or Matt Dillon (best role in years) as being the centerpiece of the cast/story, but without question the best performance comes from Terrence Dashon Howard. Howard plays a successful TV director named Cameron. He embodies the apex of the personal compromise, irony, and rage our society's stereotypes inculcate. Throughout the film, and no doubt his life, Cameron gets cornered into situations where he's forced to choose between a path of speaking truth to power, or a path which is pacifist yet morally ambiguous at best, and humiliatingly spineless at worst. We witness him consistently choosing the ""pacifist"" road rather than blowing up run-ins with the law, his wife, his boss, etc... Early in the film he's pulled over by a racist policeman (Matt Dillon) without a good reason, yet concedes to getting out of the vehicle. The policeman proceeds to molest his wife while `frisking' her and Cameron holds his tongue to avoid getting him and his wife thrown in jail, or worse. In a scene the next day, Cameron has just finished shooting a scene for his TV show and calls a wrap, confident he just got a great take. His producer (a very convincing cameo from Tony Danza) approaches him after the wrap and tells him he thinks they need another take because the young black actor in the scene didn't speak his lines `black enough'; his grammar was too correct. When Cameron tells him no, they don't need another take, the producer asks, ""Is there a problem, Cam?"" No, there's no problem. Cameron shoots another take.

In the best scene of the film Cameron is simultaneously confronted by both his oppressors and the reason his oppressors mistakenly feel they need to beat him down. He can no longer take the road of the pacifist and what follows is a scenario most of us have imagined ourselves playing out many times in one form or another, and it's frightening, foolish, courageous, and cathartic. In both screenings I attended, this scene produced involuntary cheers, applause, and nervous laughter throughout the packed theater; a kind of ironic, collective purging of fear and tension through violence. It's a fantastically representative scene played out perfectly by all, and heartbreakingly by Howard.

Even with Crash tackling twice the material most films take on, there are many issues Haggis wisely just brushes up against, then moves on: ingrained institutional racism (LAPD, etc...), the `race card' in politics, affirmative action, inter-racial couples, etc... Still, it feels like Haggis and his producers had complete artistic freedom with this project and didn't hold back. Again, good for them. There's just too much ground to cover. And maybe the most consistent and basic problem linking most of these conflicts is the language barrier. If it doesn't create the misunderstanding, it at least heightens it. Indeed, the last audible line of the film is, ""Don't talk to me unless you speak American!"" And if you think Haggis is imagining problems where none exist, or you think it's only in LA where this is the case (like two women I spoke with after watching the film told me), you're either comfortably insulated (good for you), fooling yourself, or just don't know any better - three good reasons for this film to be seen.",1295827200,4,7851,5.191002367797948
2358333,5,B000A3XY5A,"`Crash' is a film featuring a series of vignettes in LA that are all based around the issue of race. They are all interconnected in various ways and as each link is uncovered the impact only increases until you finish the film highly affected by what you have watched. This has an outstanding cast and everyone plays their roles excellently, not one actor lets the side down. Coupled with beautifully framed shots and a moving soundtrack, this very nearly offers everything you could want in a film. Some scenes will anger you, some will exasperate you and some will deeply sadden you, but every one will affect you in some way and it is a rare and wonderful film that can offer that the whole way through. This was highly lauded on its release and even after repeated viewing it loses none of its power. Highly recommended and one you really need to check out at some point.

2358334,2,B000A3XY5A,"America still has a great deal of racial tension. While advances in the sixties have removed most institutional racism, the de facto kind still persists everywhere -- just look at the yahoos in the Tea Party. This country has been waiting for an open and honest discussion of race relations that respects the feelings of others without compromising its objectivity.

And if Crash is any indication, they'll have to keep waiting. So named because of the sound of its own plot contrivences colliding with eachother, Crash takes the bold move of seeking to unite its ethnically diverse cast-- Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Arabs (represented here by Persians)-- in the firm moral position that Asians are crappy drivers and traffic in other human beings. Very progressive.

But what makes this film stand out in medicority is the staggering scope of plot contrivence used to force the crude and heavy handed moral message. We have a bigoted cop put in position to save the black married woman he molested, a racist trophy wife is cared for by her latino maid after falling down the stairs, and a latter day Black Panther of a carjacker finds himself robbing a black man due to the social conventions of his trade. Detective Don Cheadle was doing something with a racist cop shooting a genuinley crooked black cop, but he mostly just phoned in everything after his post-coital dialogue.

This film is simply the most pathetic Best Picture winner since James Cameron and his unsinkable ego (yes, it beat out both Gay Cowboys and Attack of the Killer Jews). Adding insult to injury is the potential that was blown in favor of a cheap moral message. Out of the entire two hour running time, only two conversations stood out as being written by someone other than Hallmark: the rant by the aformentioned kill whitey car thief in which he laments the state of race relations in America and how even in an upscale part of LA, all the white people are scared of the two black guys. His partner points out that it's because they have guns, so they carjack Brendan Frazer.

You cannot go wrong with carjacking Brendan Frazer! If the movie had just stuck to the formula of ranting and then carjacking, it might have deserved that Oscar. No, the only other scene to approach such sublime truth is a snippy line by Don Cheadle where he asks his latina girlfriend who exactly gathered all the diverse Spanish-speaking immigrants together and taught them how to put cars up on cinderblocks in their front yards.

But we return again to plot contrivence, which this movie has in more than spades. While the order of events is long enough to confuse the average NASCAR fan, it is still a predictable pattern that leads the semi-fluent Persian shopkeeper to blame a latino locksmith for vandalism and attempts to shoot him. Naturally, the locksmith's daughter runs out to save him with an earlier plot contivence, and both are saved by another plot contrivence from the beginning of the movie. Similarly, the least racist cop in LA shoots a black guy because he gets a little jumpy. Oh, and did I mention the black guy is the carjacker's partner, and Don Cheadle's brother (who mama loves more, despite being a deadbeat crook), who's body is examined in the morgue by the shopkeeper's daughter, who baught the gun and loaded it with blanks so he didn't kill the daughter of the locksmith who made the trophy wife of the district attorney trying to make Don Cheadle throw support behind scrubbing a racist cop who was nontheless doing his job properly nervous with his shaved hispanic head? And the carjacker's partner carjacked the husband of the molested woman and he flipped out but was saved by the Only Racially Tolerant White Cop who then shoots the hapless yob that was the focus of these two sentences? Isn't that clever!? Have I sufficiently laid out how this plot is just Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon!?!

Crash is the sort of movie that wins awards in America. It presents a lukewarm message with two-dimensional characters in a context that changes perspective enough to confuse the fat-headed public into thinking it must be deep. It would be nice to think this is a recent development but it's been the way of the Academy since it began.

2358346,5,B000A3XY5A,"When I think of the top five most inspiring scenes from any movie, tv show, or play, ""Crash"" holds scenes one, three, and four.  Watching this movie made me think, ponder, and almost cry.  When I wondered how Crash could have so many amazing scenes, one after another, I thought, ""Most movies only have one storyline that leads up to a climactic moment.  This movie has at least six storylines, each weaving in and out of each other, each one affecting the others, and each one with its own personal climactic moment.""  The minute details that Paul Haggis is able to tie together makes me as an amateur script writer to feel the need to push my creativity and creativeness to new heights.
Critics of this film complain that the storyline is atrocious, and that the dialogue does not make sense, and that the characters are just unrelatable stereotypes of each ethnicity.  As for the storyline, I cannot see any flaws in it whatsoever.  I may sound ignorant for it, but every step of the story lead me to another twist, another suprise.  Whenever I walk out of a movie, it is just my nature to ask myself ""What were the loose-ends?  What didn't make sense?  Did everything come together to form the ending, or were some tangents just left half done, as if the director hoped the audience wouldn't notice?""  Crash had no such cliffhangers.  Somehow, Haggins brought this huge cast of utterly different characers together in a smooth and fluid way.
I can see some reasons to critics complaining about the dialogue.  Crash is not spoken in an everyday way, the dialogue is dramatic, deep, and maybe a little too poetic for the characters that say them.  However, this movie isn't supposed to just portray everyday life.  It's supposed to portray every little thought that a person has, all of the terrible and hurtful things that we swallow every time we see a person of a different race.  So the dialogue may be cheesy, but sometimes are minds are cheesy.  Few moviegoers realize that our mind first reacts to situations in the most dramatic, beautiful way possible.  Crash is trying to show that first burst of pure thought in our mind through each character.
Finally, people need to stop complaining about how the characters are ""too stereotypical"".  Everyone, realize that these characters are not supposed to be real people.  They are all sympols for each race!  They are typical black men, or white woman, or asian drivers, or mexican gang bangers, blown completely out of real world proportions.  These characters aren't supposed to be real people, they are our inner beings, screaming racist and prejudice comments about anyone we see, judging them immediatly.  Obviously, people in the real world have a filter, and don't interact with other people like the characters in the movie do.  But Crash is trying to show what would happen if we just got rid of that filter, and if everything was just judged by race.  That is why this movie is a success.",1267747200,8,2953,4.745098039215686
2358347,1,B000A3XY5A,"Written and directed by Paul Haggis, this Best Picture-winner (an undeserving upset over Ang Lee's terrific Brokeback Mountain, a much more noteworthy allegory of human discrimination) drowns in its belligerent vanity and does so pitilessly, nearly pulling the well-intentioned genre -- self-romantic as it is here -- to the cooker with it. In its defense (a half-serious attempt at reconciliation for those who have mounted it as a ""classic"") it took a couple viewings for me to grow repelled by it -- to be honest, I, like most, was initially swept into acceptance of its audacity by its pinnacle moments -- but, even as soon as the opening frames of my first rehash, the musty stench of its arrogance engulfed me and I was again scooped by the product, this time ashamed at its malice and bewildered by its vindictive nature.

Structurally, Crash is a resounding example of unconformity (though its rearranged chronology is an ever-growing theme and its multi-focal yarn is an age-old cliche of priggish cinema, yet not always implemented by films of such). It is likely to become the template by which many subsequent mystery/thrillers are drawn, though that wouldn't be all that bad: it hooks its audience by immediately proposing a problem to which the answer comes together, piece-by-piece, as the story -- which jumps backwards, then proceeds in real-time, ending with its opening scene -- progresses. As we the audience travel alongside the film's event timeline, our attention is maintained thoroughly by its three climaxes, which are evenly distributed within the film's last half. Yet what is unrealized by a majority of viewers is that while their emotions have been forged and manipulated by these peaks, the movie's story -- and more specifically its script (co-penned by Bobby Moresco) -- runs amok in a cesspool of racially-directed propaganda, which is grossly mistaken for morally-motivated and ""necessary"" exposure to the cultural/ethnic differences that set aside and bring hardship to the diverse citizens of America (or, in this particular case, Los Angeles).

Crash is a textbook example of exploitation, presented with a slew of disgustingly (and abnormally) xenophobic characters, each of whom spit bigoted slurs as if they were the letters of the alphabet. Simply put, when it tries to address intolerance (which occurs with just about every interaction -- an unfortunate truth), it is smothered rather by its own impudence, which appears more political than it does substantial. In fact, Crash is packed so tight full of asinine stereotypes that, if it exploded into a million pieces, its fragments would have enough false piety in them to supply their own feature-length pictures. The film's self-importance swallows all of its positive qualities (which admittedly are not in short supply and include winning efforts by Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, and Michael Pena) and amasses to an indigestible cinematic experience without the uplift of conciliatory sensitivity or social spotlighting, which it almost embarrassingly thinks it embodies (and forever will, thanks to its three Oscars and national acclaim).",1266451200,5,3151,5.3

After the first few scenes, you know exactly how the movie will evolve. There are no surprises. The characters are wooden and one-dimensional. Good actors were wasted in this movie, which is preachy and moralistic while having nothing important to say.

Amazingly, this has become a must-see in classes having to do with ""issues"" such as racism.

Its should have the same rating that Batman and Robin, The Black Dahlia and Eye Of The Beholder rightfully earned. If you can stop believing in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, then why cant you see this movie is the worst movie on racism ever produced? Old habits die hard I guess. For the record I'm not some inbred hick that hates any movie that deals with racism. I respect every movie that dealt with racism prior to this movie.

Crash received all its hype because the Academy Awards did not want to see Brokeback Mountain. There I said it. Its no secret that the Academy Awards are paid bandwagoneers. If there is money involved they will oversell any movie to death. If you recognize that fact and still give them the benefit of the doubt then you need to get your head checked.

Crash plays like a glorified, PC to the extreme, TV movie on race. The main thing that made better movies on race relations in the past great is that the characters in them are realistic. Look at Mississippi Burning and American History X. Are the people in those movies realistic? Yes. Now look at Crash. Are the people in Crash realistic? Of course not. These people talk about race 100% of the time. I'm sorry but even the most of hardcore racist will not talk about race 100% of the time nor would they do the stupid things that the people in this movie do.

With the exception of Ryan Phillipe, Terrence Howard and Michael Pena, the performances were laughable and weak. Matt Dillon should have been perfect as the racist cop John Ryan but to say he was unbelievable is putting it nicely. When he groped Thandie Newton's butt in a traffic stop I had to hold back laughter. I was waiting for her to fart just to give this scene the hilarity it deserves. Did the writers think that was supposed to be an effective scene? Please. Show him zapping her with a taser gun or beating her down and then you would have a more accurate description of what a racist cop would do and a more effective scene. Sandra Bullock was equally unbelievable in her role. I laughed my a** off when she fell down those flights of stairs.

Ludacris's character fails big time because we all know he has no depth to his character. Just listen to his albums. Larenz Tate is slumming in his performance and Don Cheadle phones it in. The writing stinks too because as I said earlier the people are unrealistic as well as the situations they are in. I cant believe for one second that John Ryan would rescue Christine from a car accident after he fondled her buttocks in front of her husband and neither should you.

The thing that sad the most about Crash is that after its done you are left wondering what the hell you just watched. The best movies on race leave the viewer with something they never forget. This movie leaves you with nothing but unintentional humor. There are better movies out there that deserve praise and get none. Why are people still praising this dud?

Better movies on racism: Magnolia, America History X, Do The Right Thing, Bamboozled, and Mississippi Burning. Hell I'll even take Higher Learning any day over this garbage movie.",1258416000,6,3201,4.510344827586207
2358357,1,B000A3XY5A,"I just noticed a sale on Amazon.com: ""Up to 40% off Indie titles."" Most of the movies measure up the Indie classification - or at least as far as I understand the term. Crash appears as a blatant outlier to the group. This movie had one of the largest mainstream promotions and currently has one of the largest bandwagon followings of recent memory. It fakes Indie because stomaching the truth that this movie was driven by corporations looking to monopolize on stimulating your ""brain stem"" emotions just doesn't settle well. If Crash is Indie, then what what has Indie become? And how long before there's a new grassroots movement away from this new ""Pop Indie"" that's developed?

Apart from it's portrayal as Indie, I still take up issue with the movie. I agree with another poster who quoted an intelligent critic as claiming that the film treats racism as an overt occurence instead of the covert issue that it really is. Some argue that in order to address the covert issue, you need to portray it in an overt manner. That's fine with me, but just make sure the audience is aware that you're taking that artistic liberty.

2358359,5,B000A3XY5A,"Before seeing 2005's ""Crash"" I had, of course, heard the usual criticisms -- it's too contrived, unrealistic, depressing, heavy-handed, preachy, too much cussing, blah, blah, blah. Well, I've just seen it for the third time and I think it's a great film. Yes, there's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there's undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgivenes as well.

THE STORY: Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into eachother in Los Angeles over a two-day period. These people include:

- A white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmitive action and abuses his authority (Matt Dillon).
- His young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (Ryan Phillipe).
- A black tv director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (Terrence Howard).
- His light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (Thandie Newton).
- An hispanic locksmith (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and his young daughter with an 'invisible bullet-proof cloak.'
- A Persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife.
- Two black car thieves (Ludacris and Larenz Tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, Graham (Don Cheadle).
- Graham's beautiful partner and bedmate, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and her mother, a maid to...
- The District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock).
- An Asian man who gets hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead.

""Crash"" is reminiscent of another L.A. drama, the 1991 masterpiece ""Grand Canyon,"" but has enough nuances to stand on its own. For one thing, ""Crash"" is (even) more serious and dark.

As you can see above, this is a very involved story with numerous interwoven storylines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. In fact, a single viewing won't likely cut it either. It's not that type of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste the film with criticisms that aren't even legitimate. Want some examples?

For one thing, the film is about so much more than racism; it also addresses stereotypes -- those who fit them and those who escape them, hypocrites, the capacity for good and bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, abuse of power, the last straw, manhood & emasulation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favortism and more.

SPOILER ALERT! -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you've seen the film.

Furthermore, not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, Matt Dillon's cop partner never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham and Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters.

Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and hispanic) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black tv director; and the hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (for the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority. I could go on but this is enough.

Another reviewer criticizes the film with this mulitple-choice question: You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you:

a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay.
b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver.
c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!""

If you picked C, you'd love Crash.

This car-crash senario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details -- A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the Asian woman is having a fit and throwing racial slurs (she's hispanic). This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive or not. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film.

END SPOILER

Another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 48-hour period? ""Crash"" isn't saying that everyone in LA is racist or that such blow ups happen everywhere constantly, rather it focuses on a handful of such blow ups over a two-day period. Writer/director Paul Haggis has lived in the city for three decades, I bet every instance in the story is based on a real-life account, loosely or not. Which isn't to say everthing in the story is believable, but -- hey -- it's a freakin' movie.

As for it being contrived, aren't all films contrived to some extent? They all have to tell an understandable story in a mere two hours, after all. Regardless, coincidences are a fact of life; besides, the film (again) focuses on a handful of storylines that DO interconnect. By doing this ""Crash"" is intentionally ignoring all those that don't fit.

Another totally irrelevant criticism is that ""Crash"" unjustly beat out another film for Best Picture in 2005. In fact, a large portion of the negative reviews here at Amazon are obviously by bitter gays upset because their favored picture didn't win. This is all irrelevant. ""Crash"" has zero connection to that homosexual-themed movie. What matters is whether ""Crash"" is a good film or not. And I'm here to tell you that, if you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, then don't miss out on ""Crash.""",1253836800,2,7009,4.912087912087912
2358360,1,B000A3XY5A,"This didn't look all that good to me when it came out; it looked like a just-as-obvious only more-black updating of Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON and that seemed unlikely to be something that would win me over.  I was surprised when it won Best Picture; also rather surprised that one of my favorite critics loved it, and I'd have to say shocked now that I've actually seen it. I knew I was going to be in trouble pretty quickly, the glossy, burnished artificial lighting and restless camera just didn't seem to belong to the rather intimate story that it seemed (at first) that Haggis was trying to tell.

Ah, but what's that? Intimate? LA is the world, Haggis wants us to believe, and the world is racist, hateful and violent. All of it. Without exception. This is what was so noxious about the film to me -- every single character is a collection of hatred, fear, suspicion and suspended violence; and every character (of course) has a moment of redemption, and obvious and simplistic choice of whether to do ""evil"" or ""good."" The cardboard, one-dimensional treatment of the ""people"" here is made even worse by the extraordinary and ridiculous set of coincidences that bring them all together, completely Dickensian in scope but completely underserved and unbelievable, because these are not people but types and cut-outs. Asking me to accept all of this in a two-hour film that never fleshes anyone out beyond skin tone and class, and asking me to accept that this is the world we live in....too much, Mr. Haggis. If I believed that CRASH was the world, I'd have killed myself long ago. It's hard to remember a more cynical film with a worse view of humanity, which wouldn't alone make the film worthless -- it's the simpleminded, heavy-handed psychology behind it all that does that. And I saw that as someone who considers himself pretty cynical, and pretty negative in his prognosis for humanity. This is unquestionably the worst Best Picture winner I've seen (and I've seen all but 10 or so of them at this point), and one of the worst films of the 2000s so far. I liked a couple of the actors (Terrence Howard especially) and I have to say I was kept interested -- if only to predict nearly every scene and then to choke up laughing when I was right.

It's a sad, sad commentary on Hollywood that this film and DRIVING MISS DAISY are the two most visible, award-winning dramas about race in the past couple of decades, and that two of our most gifted directors (the virtually-unknown Charles Burnett, and Spike Lee), who both happen to be black and have never won Oscars, still have to struggle to get financing on anything that's not white-oriented enough.",1253836800,4,2667,4.706638115631692
2358361,4,B000A3XY5A,"Crash paints a portrait of how difficult it can be for different groups of people to get along with each other. The casting is perfect and the acting is impeccable; I couldn't ask for better cinematography and the choreography is excellent, too. The musical score enhances the picture as well. On the other hand, however, some have said that the character development isn't the best; and I agree with that. Actually, there's not *too* much here that wouldn't have been shown on ""All in the Family"" back in the 1970s--with the most notable exception of some very bad words, especially for black and Asian people. In addition, because of a gut feeling I had after watching the movie, there's some doubt in my mind that it truly deserved to win the Oscar for Best Picture.

As I mentioned above, we see the trouble people can have when they are prejudiced against other groups of people. Crash deals head-on with racism in a very frank way, which admittedly is something that Hollywood doesn't always do. We get great performances, too. We see the tension between an African-American couple, TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton); the pressure overflows when they are stopped by racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his partner Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) who is far more tolerant of diversity. There's more trouble when two thieves Anthony (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate), who is also the younger brother of a police detective, steal the car of Los Angeles' District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his very spoiled wife Jean (Sandra Bullock).

But there's even more. There's the everyday struggle of black police detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) who, in addition to some nasty office politics, must deal with a drug addicted, ailing mother and a brother (Peter) who is one of the thieves who stole the District Attorney's car. We also see tensions between the members of a family of working class Persians who lose everything they have when their store is robbed and ransacked; the locksmith (Michael Pea) had told them to fix the door but they didn't and consequently their insurance company won't pay them anything for their losses. There's plenty of trouble when Anthony and Peter accidentally run over an Asian man while driving the stolen car; he is still barely alive and they simply dump the poor man off in front of a hospital emergency room before speeding away in the stolen vehicle. A detective shoots another detective under some very sketchy and somewhat mysterious circumstances; and we see how the white District Attorney struggles to find a black man to fill a prominent spot to please the African-American community.

You might think I gave it all away; but please trust me--I didn't. There's still plenty more for you to discover and appreciate about this movie. I certainly didn't tell you how any of these problematic situations work out--sorry, no spoilers! There are some very nice extras, too. We get a behind the scenes featurette; an optional running commentary with writer/producer/director Paul Haggis, writer/producer Bobby Moresco and actor/producer Don Cheadle. There's a music video, optional Spanish subtitles and other trailers, too.

Crash may not have been the most daring film to deal head-on with racism; but it's far from weak and I wouldn't simply walk away from this. I recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie. In addition, people who like films that blend biting social commentary with action, a bedroom scene or two and a modicum of violence will want to add this to their collections.",1250380800,3,3620,4.98841059602649

2358368,4,B000A3XY5A,"They say that the sign of a thematically strong film is that it instigates widely varied opinions and controversy. This does have a controversial topic, but the widely varied reviews of this film stem from presentation of the topic and themes. I just watched this film last night, and I think the film is extraordininarily well done, culturally poignant and socially relevant.  I think some of the negative reviews stem from the fact that the various characters are a bit over exemplified culturally or racially, which in and of itself is racial stereotyping (which often occurs in the film industry, as shown by the Tony Danza scene/character in the movie).  However, the plot structure and the characters, in and of themselves, are wonderfully crafed.  The characters lives and situations at first seem all unrelatated. As the film progresses their lives dovetail together. Yes, life is not really this way, but that is the fun and thorough enjoyment that one gets from reading a really good book, graphic novel or movie. Seeing how the story unfolds itself, and picking out the interelations placed meticulously throughout the film. Crash does this very very well. For those who appreciate a good story and interesting characters (or should I say characterizations), I recommend this movie.

This provokes one to think about predjudice. The film focuses on racial prejudice. However, this film got me thinking again about prejudice in its most general terms, beyond the racial type. This is a sign of a good film, it gets you to think! Prejudice at its evil core is about humanity's inability to separate the judgement of a person (""person"" in the sense of his self-worth that commands basic respect) beyond appearances.  We are visual creatures by our very nature, and culture has only made us moreso in recent years with the overstimulation of TV commercialism and magazine visual exploitation. This overstimulation has warped our sense of what beauty is, what type of people command respect, and has enforced all types of visual prejudice.  Watch a TV commercial from 40 years ago (I don't remember them, because I am not that old, but I have seen them), and compare this to the visual onslaught of today's commercials.  Same with magazines, fashion and nonfashion alike.  Racial prejudice is but one form of a general prejudice that stems from our inability to look beyond appearances. Weight prejudice, beauty prejudice, handicapped prejudice, and racial prejudice all stem from this inability. The film presents the racial form of prejudice, perhaps in an overly dramtic way, but nonetheless in a thematically entertaining fashion that stimulates discussion.  This is a always a good thing.  The film's storyline also has a bit of irony and ironic twists in the end as well, which I always appreciate.....",1245542400,,2814,5.084598698481562
2358369,1,B000A3XY5A,"I don't normally care for the ""Oscars"" (or awards shows in general) but I remember in 2005 the intense debate (hype) to figure out what would be the ""best film"" of 2005. There was Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Munich. Personally, I would rather watch Munich again over all those movies. But other notables were Syriana and 40 year old Virgin.

My issue is all those movies previously listed, why did this win ""best film"" award? I guess its pop culture,near melodrama driven story. Because it has the greatest ""reach"" of all those movies to make the masses ""feel"", it had to the best, right? Cheese...anyway, in all honestly 40 year Old Virgin will be the most remembered and most watched movie of the entire lot for the decades to come and Carroll's performance should of at least nominated him the for the funky award (ala, Cary Grant).

You know, I would rather talk about just about any movie than this one, it just isn't that good and is largely unmemorable..In fact Ie never heard anyone recommend this movie or even talk about it in the streets or at work.",1243987200,2,1138,4.605911330049261

Great pains seem to have been taken to imply that we are all infected with this villainous disease.

Movie studio bigwigs, police officers, petty thieves, and shop owners cross paths with each other and a plethora of others and a troubling time is had by all.

It goes farther than the 'race issue' normally categorized by blacks vs. whites.  It broaches the hispanic, middle-eastern, asian, and black-on-black stereotypes that many of us who don't face racism regularly tend to ignore.  I found it paradoxical the way that the characters in the movie all exemplify the stereotypes that they would like to be exonerated from.

  I really enjoyed Ludacris, Don Cheadle, and Terrance Howard in their respective roles.  Matt Dillon also surprised me; Dillon has spent many movies typecast into sleazy roles but his character actually makes a metamorphosis that the audience can feel and understand.  Decent acting on his part.  I can't say whether I think that this movie deserved to win Best Picture, but it was definitely a worthy contender.",1236297600,6,898,5.13103448275862

The cast is first rate.  Don Cheadle stands out as a detective trying to find his criminal brother for his crackhead mother.  The understated expressions on his face say it all.  Everyone else is excellent.

If you sit out there and write negative reviews of Oscar winning films for fun, get a new hobby. If you were personally offended by this film, that's the idea. We are ALL guilty of ignorance and the distrust that it breeds within us as we are all guilty of perpetuating stereotypes we hope others would never hold. The magic of this film lies in the redemptive moments - Matt Dillon's horrific cop who risks his life to save the woman he molested, allowing both to learn that they are more the same than different.

2358380,5,B000A3XY5A,"Perhaps a movie that exposes a raw seam of racial hatred and frustration shouldn't be compared with a finely crafted piece of blown glass or a beautifully balanced symphony, But ""Crash"" brings the same level of care and artistry to the movies that is regularly found in the fine arts. The story begins and ends on a desolate road after a nighttime car crash. Don Cheadle and his Hispanic partner/lover (Jennifer Esposito) start the film by recovering from a rear-end collision involving an Asian character who is not seen again until 3/4 of the way through the film. The film backtracks several days, then follows Cheadle and a half-dozen other characters until they come full circle to the same roadside, and an unexpected discovery.

Artistic styling aside, the film scrapes away the layers of politeness that usually veil racist and ethnic suspicions. A white liberal yuppie DA and his wife (Brendan Fasier and a self-controlled Sandra Bullock) deal with a crime by freaking out at the young Hispanic man who comes to change the locks. An Iranian shopkeeper is certain that his is being cheated, and arms himself against perceived enemies. A bigoted LAPD cop (fabulous Matt Dillon) may be a black women's best friend when trouble strikes. A couple of blacks walking through a white shopping district complain bitterly about stereotyping, all the while planning a heist. Irony (sometimes rather obvious) abounds, as members of oppressed races spout the most vile, ignorant and bigoted claims about each other, and about themselves.

Director Paul Haggis sees his film as a way to deal with racism by exposing it to the open air. Viewers might debate the wisdom of that course and object to the way California is depicted as a roiling cauldron of racial animosity.. But the film's message, though fairly obvious, does not get in the way of a great story. Wonderful performances, great writing and a emotional ride.",1233100800,5,1915,4.98125
2358381,5,B000A3XY5A,"I must say that this is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  Bold, dramatic and inquisitive is how I'd describe it.  It takes on the topic of racism head-on, kind of like a wrecking ball hitting an abandoned building.  In doing so, it offers a trenchant insight into the core of what it is to be human.

Instead of being told in a straightforward, linear path, the story is like an omelet that's all mixed up.  It tells how the lives of various people in L.A. are intertwined.  From all walks of life, some of the people are good people, some are bad people and some are REALLY bad people.  As such, the film has a sort of surreal quality about it, and the subtle but effective soundtrack assists to enhance this aspect.

Unlike most movies, the film really lacks ""leading"" and ""supporting"" actors.  Virtually all of the characters in the movie could be relegated to one or the other.  It's good that it draws from a strong ensemble of actors / actresses to pull it off, including Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frasier, Ryan Phillipe, Matt Dillon & Don Chaedle.  It's also interesting to note that Bullock, normally America's sweetheart, plays the most unlikable character I've ever seen her portray.

Ultimately, the message of the movie is pretty simple, and it is this.  Black people need to grow up.  White people need to grow up.  Hispanics need to grow up.  Middle Eastern Americans need to grow up.  In short, we ALL need to start acting like grown-ups.  That said, the power of the message can only be conveyed by watching the film itself.  The most poignant scenes are crisis conditions where people are forced to treat each other as human beings regardless of what race they are.  We can all take something away from the didactic qualities of this story.",1232755200,,1763,4.589743589743589

2358392,1,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is THE WORST MOVIE to ever be nominated for an Academy Award. I've seen the term, ""after school special"" in many reviews. That's EXACTLY what it is. Every situation in the film is contrived and the content is so racially stereotypical that it's laughable. I agree with many reviewers that racial issues are still very much a part of our society. However, this movie makes the issue so one-dimensional and obvious that it sickens me to watch it. Another reviewer mentioned the film ""American History X"". Now that's a film about racial tension! Another great film on the issue is ""Gran Torino"". These films are subtle with rich characters and stories that carry a deep, underlying message. ""Crash"" pales in comparison and comes across as an employee training video on how NOT to be politically correct. The reason certain reviewers are so upset about this film is 1.) It was horrible and 2.) It managed to win Best Picture when other films like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Walk The Line"" got shafted. I believe, as many others do, that ""Crash"" won by default because ""Brokeback Mountain"" turned off some of the homophobic members of the Academy and those members didn't bother to watch it. If they had, they would have realized that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is by far the superior picture. ""Crash"" is a lame movie compared to ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Walk The Line"", Good Night, and Good Luck"", ""Cinderella Man"", or any other movie that came out that year. I really cringe thinking about it and shudder at the fact that it won the Oscar. It's proof that our quality standards are getting WAY TOO low.",1232409600,5,1598,4.8145454545454545

2358397,5,B000A3XY5A,"Apparently, I like others was skeptical about watching the movie Crash, because I had heard that it was a movie about prejudice and how it impacts the lives of those that are the target of prejudice.  Certainly the knowledge that prejudice is bad and has a huge impact on its targets should not be new to any of us that consider ourselves human.  My suspicions about how viewers perceived this movie was confirmed by a quick scan I did of a number of reviews for Crash published online.  I suspect that as with all things human, especially where emotion is involved, there is more to the story than the obvious lesson that prejudice is bad and we should not allow ourselves to be caught in its grasp.

Crash as a movie focuses on a number of events that at first seem unrelated, but are eventually tied together in a neat package.  As we watch these events unfold, we see pernicious, insidious prejudice show its ugly face.  The white police officers stop the black couple and engage in reprehensible actions, because they feel they are entitled since they are white and policemen.  An Iranian immigrant, who is concerned about his security and the security of his family at his store, hires a Hispanic locksmith to fix the lock on his door.  The locksmith tells him that he can fix the lock, but that he really needs a new door.  The man becomes irritated and tells the locksmith to only fix the door and not the lock, which he does.  That night the store owner's store is vandalized in an apparent act of prejudice.  When he discovers the vandalism the next day and the fact that the perpetrators broke in through the door he had just fixed.  He becomes irate at the man who fixed the lock and sets out to punish him. At this point a miraculous event will turn the events around and reveal some hope, while another shocking event will unexpectedly take place to show how easy and disastrous it is to fall in to the trap of stereotyping and prejudging people. These are few examples of set of events that we see in Crash that get woven together.  I could describe others as well, but to do so would be tedious and pointless.

Clearly as so many others have written in their reviews this movie is about prejudice and as we all know prejudice is a bad thing; it corrupts our souls and our humanity.  Why then make yet another movie about prejudice?  To take that position is, I think, to have fallen squarely into the trap laid by the director of Crash. Those who have formed their own prejudices about the movie based on what they think it is telling us, have missed the fundamental point; that prejudice can creep into us even when we think we are not prejudice.  Keep alert against the creeping poison of prejudice or you, too, may Crash!",1228953600,4,2740,4.491935483870968

To it's credit, there are some touching scenes between the Michael Pena character and his daughter but it wasn't enough to save the film.

I'm not sure how other people don't see it-this movie feels so much more contrived than it should. Paul Haggis' other script, 'Million Dollar Baby', is equally forced and contrived, both stories seem to eliminate logic and subtlety in a way that makes it's potential meaning feel shallow and trite.

I'd recommend 'In the Heat of the Night', 'American History X' or 'Amorres Perros' over 'Crash' any day. The latter of those three is not race-related but it's three tales all take place around one accident and is done more skillfully than 'Crash'.",1224374400,4,869,4.593548387096774
2358400,4,B000A3XY5A,"Wow, where to begin? The opening scenes of Crash made me roll my eyes and hate it. Back in the day I had a neighbor (a white female) who believed that there was no such thing as a non-racist white person, and that we should all pay some sort of tax to the black people for our continuing racism towards them. Well, the beginning of Crash seemed like it was filmed by that exact kind of illogical, paranoid, guilt-tripped person. To add to that, I live in New York City, considered by many to be the most obnoxious place on earth. I've lived here for 15 years, and I'm yet to hear someone - anyone! - making fun of a black person for riding a bus, or because their name is ""Snaniqua"". I've never seen a Chinese person yell anything about ""those %&$(@& Mexicans"". I currently live in a multicultural neighborhood where Italian, Arab, Chinese, Latin American and Russian people co-exist without racial bias. I've lived next to about five Arab-run delis for years, and none of them has ever been vandalized. Maybe L.A. is different, but somehow I find it hard to believe.

That said, the stereotypes in the beginning of Crash made me wonder whether it was worth my time to continue with it. I was sure it would end up being a 1-star movie for me. However, as the movie unfolded, it became something completely different, and ended up making a tremendous impact on me. I'm not normally a fan of those overblown dramas that Hollywood loves to push as ""important"" and ""groundbreaking"", but Crash was a surprisingly well done, beautiful and moving film that touched something deep inside my heart. People who believe this movie is about racism are wrong. It's about humanity that we all share, regardless of skin color or background. Racism is nothing but veneer, an excuse people use to find faults in others. And when push comes to shove, for most of us it's nearly not as strong as what connects us all as human beings. This is an absolute must-see.",1224288000,4,1944,4.570200573065903
2358401,2,B000A3XY5A,"By almost every metric Crash defies classification as a bad film. The acting is excellent all around, the production is clearly big-budget, and the theme, racism, is anything but trivial. The fact that it IS a terrible movie despite all it seems to have going for it makes the disappointment that much more acute.

Watching Crash is like getting smashed on the head repeatedly with a mallet while someone shouts ""RACISM IS BAD! EVERYONE IS A RACIST! YOU ARE SOMEONE SO YOU MUST BE A RACIST! YOU ARE BAD!"". This goes on for about two hours.

If that weren't bad enough someone else is repeatedly kicking you in the groin while shouting ""THIS FILM IS OSCAR WORTHY! IT REALLY IS! THE ACADEMY SAYS SO!""

I don't want to trash the Oscar process here, but suffice it to say that Crash was well served by an intensive (and expensive) Oscar campaign, so don't let the best-picture award fool you. Crash is actually just a formulaic drama that handles a delicate topic with less skill than a drunken Irishman handles sentence structure. In Swedish.

The heavy-handed treatment of racism means that you'll see the protagonists, who are essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes, thrown into absurd situations that force them to confront the reality of their own racist attitudes. While this goes on a subtle soundtrack emphasizes the emotional detachment of the characters, rising to a crescendo only in scenes that might look good as sound-bytes for the Oscar Ceremony. As a viewer you're supposed to understand that this is all very sad and serious, but you're really just being manipulated into opening your mouth so they can shovel more bull**** down your throat.

What Crash does best is to employ cool artistic and narrative styles it filched from far better films. You have the split storyline covering 3 or 4 independent narratives simultaneously , the tangential associations between characters that tie the narratives to each other, and the frequent use of filters to alter colors to parallel the emotional context of the scene.

If the narrative itself had been handled with any sort of nuance then the stylistic imitations could be easily forgiven, but the focus of this film was never to tell a good story, but to wrap it in an Oscar worthy package. They succeeded in pushing this past the judges, but that doesn't mean you have to waste your money on it too. Don't buy the hype, and don't buy this film!",1221609600,,2412,4.842233009708738

This is 'Crash'! But even moreso, what are your views regarding prejudice, racism, stereotyping, sexism? I am sure you will be tested and forced to rethink your stance once you see this. There's an A-List group of actors in this film. The cast performs splendidly, each actor sharing an equal presence, no one star  appearing larger than the other. Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, Ludacris, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Jennifer Esposito, just to name a few. The movie takes the viewer through a series twists and turns, from regualar situations from traffic accidents to the unimaginable car jacking! Not willing to give any part of this flick away, the  scene in which a little girl's life is threatened still causes the tears to pour from my eyes.

The Los Angeles Guilty White Liberal has got to be the dumbest form of humanity going, even moreso than the inbred hillbilly. You know who I mean: the latte sipping crowd that brought you such critically lauded trash as The Hours, which plumbed every arts clich imaginable; Monster, which revealed Feminazism's worst side (i.e.- murdering men is ok if the murderer disingenuously claims all men are bad rapists); or Million Dollar Baby, which proved that white trash are probably the only social group still open for out and out mockery. That last piece of tripe, incidentally, was penned by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote and directed this past year's Academy Award winning film of the year, Crash.... Perhaps the most ridiculous, and humorous, moment comes in a cameo where television actor Tony Danza plays a tv star who wants his black costars to sound more `black', so tells the black tv director to reshoot a scene. No one, in this day and age, is so clueless as to risk a lawsuit by speaking that way in public, yet the trio of fawning Left Wing dimwits comment on Danza's `subtle villainy', as if needing to display not a one of them has a clue as to the word's actual definition. Yet, cluelessly written scenes like that abound, and the fact that everyone associated with this film is clueless of them is telegraphed in the film's very first scene, where Cheadle ludicrously intones that people `crash into each other' just to feel something. Wow! Great concept for a title. Here's a better one: The Idiots Guide To Racism. Oh, wait, trademark infringement.
  The fact is, although most human beings are idiots, in relation to their emotions, their idiocy is born of complexity, which only makes real world idiocy as racism so vexing and puzzling. But, instead of focusing on the vexing motives of people's bigotry, Haggis shows the shallowness of his understanding of bigotry, not the shallowness of bigotry itself, as well as his utter lack of ambiguity and realism in portraying his characters, their actions, and motivations. This film was two hours of pure movie hell, and one of the worst films ever made; and not in that schlocky Robot Monster nor Plan 9 From Outer Space way that can endear as years pass. It's especially so, considering that a bumper sticker would have sufficed to convey its trite message. I could literally go on for several more pages, detailing every ridiculous and phony thing in this film, and still not fully convey how truly atrocious watching this film was. It should be reviled as being every bit as bigoted and truly `full of hatred' for humanity, as anything Rush Limbaugh, or his ilk, ever uttered. That no one in Hollywood recognized this real `truth' unfortunately explains why this country is where it is right now, and why racism is not the problem, merely a symptom of the real ill.",1221004800,2,2988,4.755298651252408

With an all-star cast, a haunting score by Mark Isham and a thought-provoking screenplay, ""Crash"" is a bold tapestry of humankind at their best and worst and the circumstances that eventually connect them all are a wonder to behold.

All events within the film take place in a mere 24 hours (what a difference a day makes, eh?) with five different stories set in the melting pot of melting pots: Los Angeles, CA.  The film opens and ends with a fender bender (hence the title) and the delicate issue of bigotry is dealt with a mighty blow here, a series of life-altering events affecting and eventually connecting all of the following people:

1) a black detective (Cheadle) and his Latino partner (Esposito)
2) two young black felons (Ludacris, Tate)
3) a white district attorney (Fraser) and his wife (Bullock)
4) a Persian shop owner (Toub) and his family
5) a Latino locksmith (Pena)
6) two white LA police officers (Dillon, Philippe)
7) an affluent black television producer (Howard) and his wife (Newton)

How are all these people connected, you ask?  Well, if you've ever seen ""Traffic"", you'll get an idea of how each character manages to intersect the other in an odd ""six degrees of separation"".  There are four different stories happening all at once that will culminate at the end.  This is one of the many intriguing ways in which Haggis ties everything together into a coarse and pragmatic patchwork of life in these biased United States.

Crash's biggest accomplishment comes from the manner in which it realigns its characters' perceptions by imposing life-altering situations upon them, incidents which change them for either the better or the worse.  While watching the characters' reactions to their environment, the audience is often forced to examine some of their own perceptions and ""Crash"" reveals time and again the bitter truth behind the majority of America's skewed philosophy.

Don Cheadle is excellent as Graham, a man who struggles constantly with the meager symmetry of justice. Matt Dillon is intriguing as Officer Ryan, a cop whose motives can be hard to determine but whom experience has given an inarguable wisdom.  Bullock manages to play a character that's easy to hate, a pampered suburban wife who doesn't realize who her true friends are until she's literally crying out for help, one whom she least expects.  Terrence Howard is remarkable as a television producer whose educated wife (Newton) harangues him about life's everyday prejudices after they are pulled over in a routine traffic stop in a wealthy neighborhood by two white cops.  He is frustrated and angry with her but when he begins to see the fine lines of racism suddenly and heavily bleed into his life, he at first denies it, then proceeds into self-loathing and hatred.  He eventually forgives his wife and comes to terms with various other people for their misgivings.  Ryan Philippe impresses as the morally compromised Officer Hanson - there is a shocking moment in which he is truly tested on his obligations as an officer of the law and in that moment becomes the most hypocritical character of, despite having made perfectly clear his moral dilemma in the beginning.  Most everyone else walks on and walks off but there isn't a bad performance to be had here (not even from hip-hop star Ludacris) and this ensemble cast makes the most of everything they've got.

Bottom line: There should be no argument as to what film has made the most impact in 2005 - one viewing of ""Crash"" will have you voting in its favor, hands down.",1214352000,4,3809,4.914196567862715

I'm not sure how it is not believable that the characters in a movie crossed paths. It's not coincidence... it is a story which focuses on a number of characters who cross paths... that's kind of the point. I'm not sure why so many people rated the film so low; even if you don't completely love it, it in no way deserves a 1-star rating. Anyway, the movie displays a lot of stereotypes which in this situation I think is perfect to illustrate the main theme of racism. Racism stems from stereotypes so to say that this movie was wrong for using stereotypes would be to say that the movie was wrong to bring the subject of racism to the public eye. I think this is just one of those movies that has become popular to hate, although there's really no reason to hate it other than the fact that it was so successful.",1212278400,,994,4.407608695652174

There were too many characters in this movie and no hero or person that we could identify with.  What WERE the critics thinking?  Makes you wonder sometimes how the critics can sometimes be so far out of touch with what the public likes.  Makes me begin to wonder why we even listen to the critics, as they too often get it wrong.  This is another one of those soulless movies that critics seem to adore (such as No County for Old Men, another waste of time).  Not even the big stars can rescue this stinker.

In another life, there is a black detective that gets involved in a racy case about a white male cop who supposedly shot some black men without good reason. That same detective receives a promotion just because he's black, which helps bolster the political reputation of a white man's dream. These episodes obviously point at black men as the spark behind illegal circumstances called crime.

The worst part of this film is how it delights in its own over-the-top coincidences. As if you are blown away by the profundity. Such idiocy goes so far that the actors are forced to pervert their skills in a sad attempt to salvage some sinking realism. One scene, where Ryan Phillipe shoots an unarmed black man, is particularly galling. In this lame scene, Phillipe is forced to abandon the development of his character completely and give in to the politically correct message being shoved down the viewer's throat. It is absurd and obscene!

Do I sympathize with some of the important issues discussed in this film? Of course. However, if your idea of portraying important issues involves bludgeoning the audience over the head in such a blatant manner, then the message is bound to fail, or worse, infuriate.

I saw every other movie nominated that year, and none come close to ""Crash"":  it is a story of race, redemption, anger, awareness, and ultimately, the neighborhoods we live in.  In the slightest of roles, Tony Danza captures the gritty reality of race expectations. His minor role is a snapshot of the other players in the film (Sandra Bullock as a snotty bitch??  Beautifully played....)

2358437,2,B000A3XY5A,"This was nominated as the best movie of the year?  Jeez.  How sad. The issues this movie addresses are important, but the way in which it addresses them is facile and heavyhanded.  The main problem is with the script: a talented ensemble of actors do their best with a cliche-ridden, overly-obvious, ham-fisted series of vignettes in which every character behaves in wildly implausible manners -- openly insulting people who are likely to do them bodily harm, preaching at each other about race relations, spouting leaden exposition at every turn... Ostensibly this is a latticework of interconnected stories, ala Robert Altman, but Haggis has little of the naturalness that Altman brought to bear. Every plot twist and ""reveal"" is exactly what you think it will be: this film has no genuine surprises, just as its characters have no genuine motivations. They are all stick-figure stereotypes, drafted in the service of a Hollywoodized ideal of redemption.

It is a sign of just how bad race issues in America are that so many people thought this was a laudable work of art. If this film had even an ounce of subtlety, it would have have been far more worthy of the adulation it received. I had been looking forward to seeing it -- boy, what a disappointment.

2358438,4,B000A3XY5A,"The idea that urban violence is simply a way for alienated city folk to reach out and touch each other is just one of the many original thoughts floating through Paul Haggis' Crash (as distinguished from David Cronenberg's Crash), a movie filled with original thoughts (making it doubly regrettable it doesn't have a more original title). Crash is a film about lives in the balance, another LA montage (Short Cuts, Magnolia) but probably the best so far. It weaves together its separate strands and disparate characters into a frighteningly beautiful patchwork, a fully grown up film about conflicted people and people in conflict. The subtext of Crash is intercity racial tension, but this never becomes a theme, rather it seems an inevitable and natural backdrop to the story, or indeed to any story set in a contemporary American city, and most especially in LA. A white racist cop who is also a loving son turns out to be a genuine hero. A good, non-prejudiced rookie cop winds up committing a murder. A young back hood railing against ""[...]"" stereotyping ends up becoming one himself. An angry young professional woman struggling to separate prejudice from common sense in stereotyping criminal types by their race and appearance winds up all alone with her anger. A pathological, revenge-driven Persian shop owner, sick and tired of being harassed and type-cast as an Arab, begins acting like a terrorist.

Crash offers up a dozen or so such characters wrestling with their identity and placement inside the melting pot of America as it nears boiling point. Paul Haggis' film doesn't reduce questions of racial prejudice to mere ideology or political incorrectness, however, which in the world of movies-by-numbers is something of a miracle. Instead he allows prejudice simply to exist, without judging it, an integral part of the life of his characters and the substance of their world. If everyone is racist, he seems to say, then no one is. Prejudice is inevitable when different races are forced to live together without any real means of interrelation. It's human instinct to distrust what is different from ourselves, after all, and the film isn't afraid to show how sometimes prejudice can even be justified (though it also makes it clear that most of the time it isn't). The biggest problem, Haggis may be suggesting, is when these natural feelings of suspicion or hostility towards others are denied verbal or emotional expression, and so can fester and grow until they come out in acts. Hence, ""crash.""

In Crash, the cracker cop (Matt Dillon) seems utterly irredeemable in his first scene, yet by the end of the movie he has become one of the most sympathetic characters in a film filled with sympathetic characters (even the deranged Arab, uh, Persian, invokes pity). Of course, sympathetic doesn't necessarily mean likeable, although Hollywood movies never seem to acknowledge that there is a difference, and that audiences don't have to admire or envy a character in order to relate to him. Haggis doesn't let us judge the Dillon character, for example, by his beliefs. He forces us to stay with him and witness his many other sides. The same woman he humiliates, the cracker cop later rescues from a horrible death. Haggis is intent on showing that people are complex beings, and infinitely greater than the sum of their beliefs, prejudices, and actions.

Crash is one of the very few truly adult movies to come out of Hollywood so far this millennium. Its characters are observed not through the narrow crack of Hollywood's conceit, but from the full 360 degrees of a creative imagination. They aren't just given token shadings, these people are nothing but shadings. Haggis never makes the mistake of letting us think we know these people (or that he does), and he never allows us to judge them based on what little we see of them, since every new thing we see contradicts whatever we've seen before. The film seems consciously designed to this end, to remind us of the futility of judging others before all the evidence is in, and of the fact that it never really is. Without a full picture of ""the facts,"" any judgment at all is simply prejudice. Or, as Jimmy Stewart counseled Katherine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story:

""The time to make up your mind about people is never.""",1204588800,3,4304,4.924242424242424

Suffice to say then, it is an interweaving set of characters tales, all of which show the results or origins of bigotry or prejudice, in various guises.
It is a fascinating and superbly weaved tale which never relies on thriller tricks to keep you gripped - the drama which will keep you glued here is all driven by the characters.  And with such a plethora of characters in the movie, it is incredible that the director, Paul Haggis, managed to leave you at the end with a feeling of understanding of each.
The performances from the superb cast are uniformly excellent, with Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle especially shining, and the locations in L.A. seem to perfectly illustrate the anachronism of our age that has thrown into spotlight the differences between races and cultures, living side by side.

Crash is an extraordinary movie that involves one of the best supporting casts I have ever seen. The movie is so powerful that it will send goosebumps throughout your body - I know it did for me. There are so many different plot lines in the movie, and they are all intertwined so perfectly, I don't understand how it's possible for someone to not like this movie. Crash emphasizes a theme that is so prevalent and so important in today's society that I would recommend it over and over again.

To put it simply, Crash is just BRILLIANT. I would be proud to include Crash in the list of my top ten favorite movies, EVER, it's that good!

To anyone who has not yet seen Crash, you MUST see it. Don't listen to all those pessimists out there who say this movie is not good or that it is unrealistic. First of all, how many movies are actually realistic nowadays, with Hollywood and all? Exactly my point. Secondly, I would argue that the movie IS realistic -- at least its themes are -- and there is no other movie that can begin to touch what Paul Haggis has done here with Crash.

2358443,2,B000A3XY5A,"My most vivid memory from the 2005 Academy Awards has to be the reaction Jack Nicholson gave the entire live crowd upon reading the winner for Best Picture. Everyone there was clearly expecting ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Walk The Line"" to carry off that award. But, they didn't, and Nicholson's shocked expression spoke sheer volumes to that effect. I don't even think he was expecting to find ""Crash"" written anywhere inside that envelope.

The fact is, nobody listening was expecting to hear him announce it either.

Why? Because, quite simply, ""Crash"" did not deserve to win Best Picture.

Don't get me wrong. This film was certainly very well acted and well-intentioned. But, haven't we all seen this exact same story done countless times before? I can think of at least five other race-related films that were far more deserving of the gushing accolades Paul Haggis received for this release. His depiction of modern-day Los Angeles is so unrealistically off the mark and behind the times. This is not to say that racism no longer exists within that city or across this nation, because it obviously does. But, come on, let's get real! Do asian americans or citizens of middle eastern descent honestly speak or represent themselves as stereotypically as they do within the context of this motion picture? Sorry, but none of them in my own personal experience ever have. The minorities depicted here were far better suited to a screenplay set in and around the rabidly less-tolerable 1960s. My spouse of fifteen years, who happens to be black, picked up on this observation right away, as did many of our mutual friends who have lived their entire lives within the greater Los Angeles area.

The first rate acting from the highly decorated and talented cast is all that unfortunately moves me to grant ""Crash"" two meager stars. If you pay anything less than the same $6.99 we wasted for a copy at Best Buy last night, it would still be far more money than this over-rated and horrendously propagandic ""Oscar winner"" deserves.",1202083200,7,2026,4.915204678362573
2358444,1,B000A3XY5A,"See, in the crazed mind of the out-of-control, held-together-with-string, neurotic liberal, the entire world is foaming at the mouth with racist diatribes.  People in LA are constantly spouting racist hate words at each other.  This is simply not reality.  This is the wierd core liberal fantasy - that we all racistly hate eachother allatime and just want to get down to some serious helter-skelter straightaway.  This fantasy is so compelling for the liberal that one cannot help but see it as a crude wish fulfillment: this is the way Haggis thinks, so he thinks that everybody thinks the same way.  And, to dramatize this, he comes up with completely implausible scenarios, like the one where the ""Persian"" (NOT ARAB, MIND YOU!) store owner's store is vandalized by hate-mongers who spray-paint ""raghead"" all over the place and generally wreck the already-unrecognizeable merchandise.  (If anyone can tell me what that store was supposed to be selling, please post!  The merchandise completely heterogenous, generic and nameless.) Now, things like this simply don't really happen in LA, where I am from.  I grew up in LA.  I lived there for about twenty five years.  The place is simply not a racist powderkeg ready to explode.  But, in the mind of Haggis, it is... because most likely Haggis' own mind is just such a powderkeg.
Also, Haggis seems to put racist slurs into action within the movie.  There is a scene where a Chinese woman motorist accuses the hispanic (race, race, race!) motorist she rear-ended of ""blaking in middoo of stleet!""  Keep in mind: this is what the character ACTUALLY SAID.  Now, I have several Chinese-born immigrant friends.  And so I think I can say with some assurance that Chinese people do not talk in this stereotyped way.  For the simple reason that in Chinese there IS AN R SOUND!  It is Japanese that lacks the R sound, and instead has a sound similar to the Italian R, using the tip of the tongue.  So, Chinese people do not have trouble with the R sound.  Only racist stereotypes like Haggis' Chinese character do.  You know what the movie reminds me of?  A very special episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, with many different racist characters in the Larry David role.  It could be called Curb Your Foaming Racism.
However, the movie does entertain, because one laughs at how bad it really is.  My favorite scene was where Matt Dillon's (great actor, wasted here) cop character, who rather unprofessionally felt up a black woman in a previous scene, encounters the same black woman trapped in a car that is just about to burst into flames, as all cars do in Hollywood.  He begins to try to free her, but when she sees who he is she freaks, screaming, ""Don't touch me!"".  He then explains that he must touch her in order to save her from a fiery death.  She grudgingly assents.  Then follows a scene where he is inadvertently gropinng her in the process of freeing her from her seatbelt.  Sheer hilarity.  It would have been all the better if he was saying things like, ""Ma'am, I'm gonna have to stick my thumb up your r*ctum in order to free you.""  ""Uhh, OK""  ""And Ma'am, I'm gonna have to fondle your m@mmaries.  It's all part of the freeing process, you unnerstand.""  ""Uhh, OK I guess...""  I loved it.",1200873600,9,3246,4.7272727272727275

It tries to address this serious issue--but it does so by producing contrived scenarios and numerous coincidences. I mean the film is about as subtle as a punch in the face. The writers are practically forcing this crap down our throats. It's like they're saying ""LOOK! LOOK AT HOW RACIST EVERYONE IS!"" We get it. Infact, I got it about ten minutes into the movie. I don't need to constantly be reminded throughout the entire film. Addressing the issue of race is fine, but addressing it 50 million times in one movie is blatant overkill.

There are, however, some good things about this movie. It delivers an excellent cast. Sandra Bullock, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, and Don Cheadle all give brilliant performances. Even Ludacris delivers well. The incredible casting, and acting, are what save this movie from complete failure. The actors basically carry the incredibly contrived plot.

2358476,3,B000A3XY5A,"The first time I saw `Crash' I quickly labeled it a masterpiece, so much so that when it defeated the goliath that was `Brokeback Mountain' for the Best Picture Oscar I actually defended it during the onslaught of disapproval.  After a second viewing though I have a very different opinion of the film.  I still enjoy `Crash' to a degree but I began to notice things this second time around that for some odd reason didn't bother me during the first viewing.  I just want to say that I am a person who believes in subtleties, especially when you're trying to make something believable and or relatable.  When approaching the controversial subject of race relations one needs to use tact and discernment, not to avoid stepping on toes but to make the situations realistic.  That is my biggest issue with `Crash'.  It is far too blunt and outlandish with its racist propaganda it paints every occurrence throughout the day to be a race related issue, and we all know that that is just not the case.  The script never allows the audience to soak up the real issues because we are too focused on the overly contrived scenarios.

I may be able to get behind the idea or concept that each and every human, at least in the America's, has a sliver of ingrown racism.  This of course is due to the ever popular tradition of stereotyping and the heavy push the media gives to cementing those stereotypes into our heads.  It's a sad predicament, but it's one that everyone is for the most part aware of.  That said it was a shame that Paul Haggis couldn't have approached this film with a little more grace so as to make his statement truly affective.  If he had just reigned in his constant barrage of racial slurs and stereotypes himself then maybe I could have walked away from this film feeling like it would make an impact, open some eyes maybe, but in the end I don't feel it could do that.

The film features interwoven stories of a group of LA inhabitants who just so happen to experience racism around every corner.  You have a District Attorney and his wife who are car jacked by two young African American's.  You have a black cop and his Hispanic partner who uncover a murder of a black police officer by a white undercover cop.  You have a Mexican locksmith and a Persian store owner who have an altercation regarding a door as well as a black television producer and his wife who are antagonized and harassed by a racist white cop and his reluctant partner.  And then there are suspicious Chinese men with a van.  The lives of all these people are presented in a hodgepodge of racially tense scenes, most of which are ridiculously unbelievable.

There are a few scenes that are realistically portrayed and it's within those scenes that `Crash' gets its point across.  When Cameron (the television director) is approached by his boss to reshoot a scene where the African American actor appeared too smart it was a subtle yet powerful portrayal of the media's opinion of a race in general.  It's a shame they went and messed that up with having Cameron go on a tantrum that was both irrational and utterly unconvincing.  There are also scenes that are turned into more than they really are.  When Cameron and his wife Christine are accosted by Officer Ryan Christine turns her husbands reaction to the situation into a black white thing as in ""you're not black enough to defend me"" when in actuality his reaction was more a ""you're not man enough to defend me"".  It has nothing to do with race whatsoever.  He was chicken, didn't want to ruffle feathers.  If the couple had been white it would have been the same thing, a husband allowing another man to molest his wife so as not to wind up incarcerated.

It's apparent to me that Paul Haggis was just trying way too hard and this subject should not be a difficult one to approach since it is an apparent problem, but it's within the subtleties that this becomes relatable and most importantly believable.

As someone has mentioned already, the Academy got this movie all backwards, rewarding it for a ridiculously clichd script and handing it the Oscar for being pretty much an uneven and heavy-handed film but ignoring altogether the brilliant acting that made this film palatable.  In fact I can honestly say that this film deserved so much more than just one acting nomination for the entire cast really delivered, and they had to, for it's not like the script was helping them any.  Matt Dillon may be the apparent standout, and I was so happy to see him get the nomination since he truly deserved it, but he is far from the only deserving cast member.

Don Cheadle is a brilliant actor and he infuses equal parts drama and humor to make his performance memorable.  Both Ludacris and Larenz Tate are excellent as the two young thugs who steal the car in the beginning that starts the whole downward spiral.  In fact their conversations about racism itself are some of the highlights of the film.  Michael Pena also delivers wonderfully here as Daniel, the lock locksmith.  His performance or at least his character is probably the most moving of the film and he is the center for one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film.  Both Sandra Bullock and Thandie Newton deliver here but I'd give the leg up to Bullock who really sinks her teeth into her performance.  It's a much more reserved and quiet performance as apposed to Newton's more eccentric performance.  They both are good but Newton comes off a little uneven in parts.  I am not a fan of Howard in the least and his flip out just killed all the joy I was actually finding in the subtleties of his performance.  Sadly Brendan Fraser and Jennifer Esposito aren't given too much to work with, but they do well with what they are given.

In the end I can't say that I hate this film but I can say that it did not deserve the amount of praise it received in the end.  In fact if this movie had not won the Oscar I probably would have given it a slightly higher rating, but when you are declared Best Picture of the year then you have to reach a certain amount of dignity and a level of perfection that the remaining nominees had failed to attain.  `Crash' did not do that.  In fact I can personally think of three fellow nominees who deserved the big prize over `Crash', all of which reached those heights.",1193097600,5,6324,4.543689320388349

2358478,1,B000A3XY5A,"Haggis: a dish comprising the (mostly) inedible internal organs of a sheep, minced with suet and oatmeal and boiled in the animal's stomach

Screed: a lengthy discourse or harangue  (OED, 2nd edition)

The story goes that the people at Focus Features sent the folks at Lion's Gate a bottle of champagne and a note of congratulations when ""Crash"" beat out ""Brokeback Mountain"" for Best Picture. It should have been the other way 'round, as it's likely ""Crash"" was nominated for Best Picture only to counterbalance ""the gay cowboy movie"" so many Academy Members refused to see, let alone vote for.

As someone who badly wanted ""Brokeback Mountain"" to win Best Picture, it took more than 18 months for me to work up the courage to watch ""Crash"". Despite the mixed reviews -- not a few of which excoriated it -- and a position halfway down Premiere's statistical ranking of 2004's films, I was worried that ""Crash"" might prove to be an exceptionally fine film.

I had nothing to worry about. In my 55 years of film viewing, ""Crash"" is one of the worst dramatic films I've ever seen. It is appallingly bad.

""Crash"" was inspired by the theft of Haggis's car, and a memoir by a former LA police officer exposing the department's racism and detailing some of the incidents portrayed in the movie. His story might have made a great film, except for Haggis's total miscalculation of how to treat the material.

Not wanting to tell a PC ""everyone non-white in LA is a victim of white racism"" tale, Haggis instead created an ""everyone hates everyone else"" story. This might not be far from the truth, but it necessarily requires a huge cast and reduces the complexities of human relationships to inelegant and clumsily juxtaposed vignettes.

Mr. Haggis forgot that you can't write a good drama about a social problem, only about the people it involves. In attempting to present a multi-dimensional view of racism, ""Crash"" is obliged to introduce so many characters that it becomes impossible to focus on any one of them with any subtlety in a two-hour film.

The resulting haggis is an overwrought screed that might have come from the pen of a high-school student who knows nothing about dramatic plausibility. (The Dillon/Newton poster catches ""Crash""'s over-the-top tone quite well, just as the ""Brokeback Mountain"" poster accurately reflects that film's reserved mood.) Haggis finds no better way to initiate character interaction than by having them ""crash"" into each other through sheer coincidence, of which most occurrences are groaningly ironic.

Even worse than the forced meetings are the ""Someone Learned An Important Lesson"" scenes, no more subtle than those in icky family sitcoms. The worst of these occurs after Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) conveniently falls down the stairs so her despised Mexican maid can help her, when her other friends won't.

Their ""reconciliation"" is amateurish beyond belief. Instead of Mrs. Cabot simply saying ""You were there when I needed you. Thank you."", she hugs the maid and gushes (in an understated way for a gush) ""You're my only friend."" <sniff, sniff> What [stuff]. (I can't say [stuff] -- it's a four-letter word starting with C, something you see every day -- because Amazon will censor it.) She doesn't even offer the maid a raise!

There is _one_ charming and engaging scene, between Daniel (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and his daughter, which I won't spoil for those who choose to see the film. But we discover toward the end of the movie that this scene was a ""set-up"", part of the process of forcing Farhad (Shaun Toub) to Learn The Error Of His Ways in a cheaply histrionic sequence. (It should also be noted that a critical plot point regarding this ""payoff"" scene isn't clearly made, leading to extreme viewer confusion.)

""Crash"" is interesting only as a document of LA race relations. But it won't soon be forgotten -- as a poor film that beat a significant and challenging one for the Oscar. Annie Proulx should have swallowed her (understandable) bitterness and kept her mouth shut, but ""Crash"" is, indeed -- on a dramatic level -- ""trash"".

If you're in the mood for better -- and cleverer -- films about racism, try ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"", or ""Amos and Andrew"", or even ""Coneheads"". (They're not great, just a heck of a lot better than ""Crash"".) And if all you want is just a truly great film, try ""Idiocracy"" or ""The King of Comedy"" or ""Network"".",1192060800,9,4412,4.873164218958611

2358498,4,B000A3XY5A,"I remember being at an Oscars party here in San Francisco the year this movie won the Academy Award, and the shout of dismay that went through the room when ""we"" were cheated out of an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain.  One fellow explained to me that the Oscars were voted on by a bunch of wealthy white people in Beverly Hills who were scared out of their minds by the prospect of being carjacked by blacks with guns.  And that's why CRASH won, out of a superstitious dread reckoning.  Then why didn't BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES win, fool--asked I--instead it's been universally reviled as one of the worst movies of all time.

They had plenty of answers to that one, but on the whole I was satisfied with the explanation fed me.  But finally I got to see CRASH on DVD and I was pleasantly shocked to find myself enjoying every moment!  OK, so it was pretty preposterous, and OK, maybe white people like William Fichtner don't unleash their racial prejudices on black men like Don Cheadle every day of their working lives.  I found CRASH an interesting meta-movie, not so much about race as about the whole idea of ""interlock"" especially as it has become the common language to movies today.

Seems like every other picture you see is all about, picking up the loose ends from act one and resolving them in some unexpected way--and that's all they're about.  If a girl gets up in the morning, and the camera shows her choosing between a red dress and a white dress at her closet, and she picks the red dress, by the end of the movie there will be a scene that is supposed to make you cry out, ""She should have picked the white dress!""  Indeed no image in cinema is photographed without a planned payoff, and that's why US movies are so by the book, even the cleverly juggled ones like PULP FICTION, and now CRASH.  When the Persian liquor store owners ask their beautiful, professional daughter what time she has to go to work, and she replies, ""Not until ten,"" there isn't a movie goer alive who doesn't know that-- much later on in the movie--her occupation will be a crucial reveal in the movie.  When Don Cheadle's bleary-eyed, Ethel Waters of a mother moans about ""Don Cheadle, when are you going to bring home your little brother?"" we just know there's going to be more about the brother, and smart moviegoers are taking bets on which character is was going to turn out to be.  At first I was sure it was Sandra Bullock, perhaps passing for white to pose as the ""wife"" of slick DA Brendan Fraser, constantly snappish maybe to conceal the fact that ""she"" was really a light-skinned black man.  I still think that would have been a better ending than the one we got.

But nevertheless did I like this, or Cronenberg's CRASH better, I say this.  Both pictures may play equally to the racial fears of white North Americans, but at least this one didn't have James Spader, who must have been busy when they were casting for Brendan Fraser's part, which I consider a break for everyone involved.",1188345600,2,2990,4.5092592592592595

First off let me explain to anyone who has not seen this movie that there are some good actors in this film with good performances... for such a lousy script, many times they made something out of complete non scenes. So it has that going for it, and that's where it stops.  the plot is completely ridiculous, that people would run into one another at just the right time in a city the size of LA...come on. Ok, I'll suspend disbelief and let that one go, then there is the script, ouch!

Real people don't act like this, fake Hollywood snobs might but not working America..  This movie was trying to be profound and say something about racism in America and all it said to me was the writer needs to get off his laptop and experience real people and not just the coked out, privileged, white, Hollywood elite he's been rubbing elbows with.

2358511,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a series of story lines interconnecting with each other over a 48 hour period in Los Angeles. Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito are detectives who are sleeping together and investigating the shooting of a black cop by a white cop. Brendan Fraser is the DA who is car jacked and Sandra Bullock his uppity wife who is angry at the world. There is the middle eastern family trying to make a living running a small store and then it is broken into and vandalized. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are a well-off black couple who are pulled over for no reason by Matt Dillon's racist cop. There are other stories as well and they all criss-cross throughout the movie.

One of the problems is how often they criss-cross. That kind of thing works in a screw-ball comedy, but not necessarily in a very serious, message movie like this. It all seems like a set-up in the end. Also sometimes the message is delivered a little heavily, like the film makers felt they needed to shout, 'this is the message, pay attention'. Some of the story lines were compelling and all the actors gave excellent performances.

The cast is very good, indeed, but this is not a movie; it is a collection of scenes, vignettes, scraps of scenes put together with a heavy-handed theme called racism. This film has been compared favorably to Altman's ""Shortcuts,"" a favorite among Los Angeles cynics, but what that film had going for it besides its director was the writing which came from Raymond Carver, a master of the short story. Racism is a good subject, of course, but racism as seen from the point of view of embittered victims is propaganda. There is nothing even hinted at regarding the real racism that affects Angelenos, which is the racism of one minority against the other. What of the deadly conflict between black and Latinos in LA? That is ignored in favor of the racism of the past when LA was ruled by whites. Ain't so no more, but the filmmakers are too white themselves to see this.

2358516,5,B000A3XY5A,"Much like another reviewer (Knusper), I began watching this film with some reservations. I'm thinking it would be nothing more than a mass-produced Hollywood race flick with the tried-and-true ""blame it all on whitey"" bottom line. But this stunning motion picture is not like that at all. It's a complex snapshot of modern race relations in America. And so many times, while watching the film, you find yourself asking the question: How would I respond if I were in that situation? How do I feel watching these racially charged episodes play out on the screen?

A good example would be the love scene (if you can call it that) between Don Cheadle's character and the lovely Jennifer Esposito. No doubt a sexually explicit scene featuring a fair-skinned woman getting her shag on with a black male is bound to get a reaction. I confess to some uncomfortable feelings myself, then wondered how other audience members reacted to the same scene. How many African-American women felt betrayed, perhaps even angry that a successful black man would choose to be with a Caucasian instead of a 'more deserving' black woman? How many whites watched that with open-jawed disbelief, shocked that such an attractive woman would want to be with 'just a black guy', confident that she would be better off with a 'nice white man'? Yeah, this film gets to you like that, which is exactly what I liked about it. It makes you think. A refreshing departure from the usual stream of mindless sex and violence that normally flows from Tinseltown.

Just an interesting sidebar: Jennifer Esposito's character in the film presents herself as a Latina mix, but in real life, she was born in New York to parents of Italian heritage. Another interesting note...the media darling for the 2005 Academy Awards was the gay cowboy love story ""Brokeback Mountain"", which, with 8 nominations, was favored to win for Best Picture. I haven't seen BM and don't need to...not my cup of tea. But I just don't see how a movie about two sheepherders having a gay fling could hold a candle to ""Crash"". The Academy did the right thing in giving the Best Picture honor to this masterpiece.

The entire cast was outstanding, but in particular: Matt Dillon as the racist cop.. snobbish, uppity housewife Sandra Bullock, who seems to think everyone is beneath her..Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard, as the upper-crust black couple. Suprisingly, two characters in the film who seem to be open-minded enough..at least in the beginning...to escape the pitfalls of racist behaviour, end up being the movie's two most tragic victims..Ryan Phillippe and Larenz Tate.

I just can't identify with others here who gave this film low marks, accusing it of being 'contrived', 'preachy' or 'heavy-handed'. Yes it was 'contrived', all movies are. It takes months, sometimes years, to hammer out a storyline and script for a film like this. As for 'preachy' and 'heavy-handed', oh yeah. This film packs an important message, which may have been part of the problem: Some folks don't like being preached to (usually because they think they already know it all), even if it's a valuable message that needs to be heard: You can't always judge a book by its cover, OR a person by their skin color.",1183939200,5,3233,4.894160583941606

2358519,2,B000A3XY5A,"Recent reviewers are baffled by  all the raves this very, VERY mediocre movie has gotten, by both the critics and the teeming masses.  I think the reason for this is along the same lines as where an entire Danish village turned out to applaud the clothing taste of an Emperor who was, in fact, marching around in his birthday suit.

From the beginning, we were told how daring and provocative ""Crash"" was.  How it made you really, and I mean REALLY think about racism in this country.  How raw and natural the dialogue was.  How important films like this are to break through the typical Hollywood stereotypes, and get folks to engage in some meaningful discourse.

OK....If you say so.  To me, it seemed like a live-action version of the Aaron McGruder ""Boondocks"" comic strip, with actual words substituted for the squiggly lines, stars and exclamation points.  ""Crash""  is a glimpse of real inner-city racial conflicts the same way that ""Baywatch"" shows real lifeguards at work.

Here's what I got out of it; (And I'm trying not to write any spoilers.)

1.  Big black guy, who's well educated and successful, and browbeaten by his limousine liberal black wife for not being black enough.  He discovers his inner ""Mr. T"", after being humiliated in at a traffic stop.

2.  You got a white cop--one of the dudes who bounced on the big black successful guy, who is a racist because his working-class liberal father was a victim of affirmative action, and reduced to invalid status where he is at the mercy of a nursing staff that resemble clerks in the post office, with their compassion and girth.

This white cop sorta redeems himself in one of the most contrived movie scenes since Dorothy Oz woke up in Kansas, discovering her whole adventure was just a dream.  (Doggone it!  I hope I didn't ruin that film for anyone.)

3.  We also have an East-Asian man, who acts utterly without a conscience in his endeavor to achieve the ""American Dream""

4. Next we have the Hispanic guy.  Young, hardworking, father of a cute little girl, and basically an angel in a wifebeater shirt.

Naturally....he's menaced by...

5. Beverly Hills housewife who's convinced he's stealing from her, and...

6.  Paranoid Middle Eastern guy who's convinced he's stealing from him.  (The latter conflict gets resolved in a scene that makes the white cop's redemption seem like a National Geographic documentary by comparison.)

Then there's Don Cheadle.  That man can really wear clothes!  Seriously, if he dies before he loses his physique, they should mummify him and use him as a mannequin in a department store.  The Donster plays a Los Angeles detective with a hundred thousand dollar a year clothing expense allowance, who tries to solve the murder of this aspiring black country singer--dude, I'm serious--who in one way or another bumps into the rest of the characters.

Conspicuously absent was the black on Hispanic violence that makes up nearly ALL of the interracial fighting in Los Angeles.  Why did the filmmakers do this?  I mean, it's not like the TV stations don't talk about this sort of racial unrest several times a week.

Maybe the studio was scared that showing blacks and Hispanics slugging it out would incite real blacks and real Hispanics to start fights in theaters, the way they did in 1979 with the movie ""The Warriors"".

Or...maybe the script was written in 1979, and it took them 25 years to get it produced.

I gave it TWO stars instead of ONE, because of the black Country and Western guy.  When you think about it, someone will need to fill that void when Charley Pride cashes in his chips and rides to that great big roundup in the sky.

The message the movie conveys is strong, and very well crafted, but at points seems a bit forced (creating tension at times, when in the real world, there would be none.)  The cast as I mentioned is strong, but also a bit phony.  For some reason, I find it hard to identify with the wealthy upper-class couple of Bullock and Fraser.

Then, we flip back to the previous day. Throughout the movie, we meet various people. All of them think ""I know everything and I'm better than everyone else."" However, as the movie progresses, each character is forced to realize their own shortcomings. The main lesson that each person learns is to accept help when they need it the most.

What ensues is an offensive misguided work which feels too ambitious and too quote unquote real (which makes it seem less real) for its own good.. If i was going to make a movie on such heady material I would first look for a cast of people that do not have the star recognition that so often gets in the way with the material (which is trying to seem so real and commonplace).. Seeing big stars pop on the screen always interferes with this kind of realism (when vittorio de sica made 'bicycle thieves' he turned down cary grant to use the more ordinary working class nonactor who made the film so great).. The dialogue in 'crash' feels too close to pulp fiction to have any glimmer of originality.. If you want a powerful film about racial relations i would suggest spike lee's 'do the right thing' it is much less pretensious and stylistically it is the opposite approach.,1179792000,6,1078,4.477157360406092

2358539,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a film that revolves around racism and bigotry, and as such it's no surprise that it's become such a controversial film.  It was a major achievement for it to garner the Best Picture Oscar (which arguably ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B000BCKFWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>"" actually deserved, but one doesn't expect the Academy to bestow awards to those films which truly deserve them), but although it did, and although Roger Ebert proclaimed it the ""Best Film of 2005"" (though the film actually premiered in 2004), ""Crash"" has been viewed rather negatively by the general public.  It's probably because most people won't be able to sit through 15 minutes of the film without becoming furious and frustrated to the point where they stop watching.

""Crash"" essentially focuses on a group of ordinary people living in Los Angeles and how racism affects their lives.  The first half of the film boils with anger, hostility, and, of course, racism.  There was more than one point in the film where I wondered just what point writer/director Paul Haggis was trying to make.  The second half, however, makes it all worth it.  In the second half of the movie, the lives of the first half's characters interweave, each person affecting each other more than they'll ever know.  Everything comes together.  At one point in the film, a character says, ""You think you know who you are?  You have no idea.""  By the end of the film's second half, each of its characters know just who they are, and we do too.  In each of these apparently despicable racists or wrongdoers, there is a good person who, when it comes down to it, can overcome their racism without thought.  At its core, ""Crash"" points out that life is like a car bound to crash, gathering speed through every moment of our lives.  Who you are before the crash isn't important - it's who you are afterward that matters.

Paul Haggis, who showcased his screenwriting talents with his script for Clint Eastwood's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Million-Dollar-Baby/dp/B00005JNP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Million Dollar Baby</a>,"" proves with ""Crash"" that he is every bit as talented a director as a writer.  ""Crash"" is an empassioned, initially sickening and ultimately beautiful portrait of humanity and its triumph over the negative aspects of society.  The script, written by Haggis and Bobby Moresco, is magnificently-written and intricately plotted.  The dialog sounds effortlessly realistic, helped by the performances of a very talented cast.  The cast is highlighted by Matt Dillon's portrayal of a vile member of the L.A.P.D., who in the film's most powerful scene is suddenly transformed into a caring, selfless human being.  All this is captured by James Muro, who shoots the movie as though each frame is a painting.

In the end, that's what ""Crash"" feels like: a dazzling mosiac of ordinary people and how they inevitably collide.  I can understand the negative response to the movie - as I've said, I too was tempted to shut it off about fifteen minutes into the first half.  But anyone who still feels that the movie is trash after watching it for its entire duration is missing the point.  It's a masterwork about life and the momentum we gather with every beat of our hearts, until finally we collide, shattering ourselves into disjointed pieces.  And the message of ""Crash"" is that it's not who you were before you fell to pieces: it's who you are after you piece yourself back together.",1178928000,4,3570,5.21015761821366

"" - by Rollo May, ""Love and Will""

The deadliest weapon of all is not a gun, a knife, a bomb, or a poison. They just finish the job, which always starts with the words. We are very creative in choosing the right words that will hurt and infuriate the fellow human being and start the unstoppable nuclear reaction of hatred, intolerance, and violence. ""Crash"" is about such reactions that lead to the collision of races, backgrounds, characters, and cultures - all that big modern American city like L.A. is built of. The lives of Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are smashed into one another quickly and painfully - in the course of one day that will change these lives forever.

The film is an impressive directorial debut by Paul Haggis; an Oscar nominated screenwriter of ""Million Dollar Baby"". ""Crash"", IMO is much better written than M$B. Acting is superb by all cast (Don Cheaddle, Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock in a small supporting role playing against her usual nice girl image and very good in it, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillippe and Matt Dillon who is a revelation as an arrogant racist cop who would turn by his different side later on).

I was going to say that the film is not perfect and it depends a bit too much on coincidence - but life is a chain of coincidences, sometimes even more than we can imagine.

2358564,5,B000A3XY5A,"Last weekend my husband and I watched the movie ""Crash"" which received 3 Academy Awards in 2005, including Best Picture. At first I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it because the title made me think of drug usage and I hate watching that kind of movie. This movie is loaded with talent and while I still am contemplating the story and how I felt about it, I believe that the acting was superb and I was definitely involved in the movie.

This star studded cast includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris ""ludacris"" Bridges, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, and Michael Pena. This film received two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper. It is an urban thriller and you really aren't sure where it is going as you watch it. There are several lives that intersect. The movie is about prejudices and how we all have them.

About 15 minutes in there is a scene between Matt Dillon and a person he pulls over (he is a cop), his treatment of her had me ready to leave the room, but I stuck it out and I am glad I did. Each of these people had good and bad points about them. They were humans and ultimately, it was that fact that won me over. We all screw up, we all do, think and say things that are politically incorrect, but ultimately, we have the deire to do good and treat others well. There are a couple of eye popping, very emotional moments, so be prepared to be shocked.

A middle-east man who struggles to maintain a store a faces intrusion and destruction of his business. A detective who must decide to protect or do justice to his robber younger brother.

Pyramids are not built with a bunch of large stones on top of towwers that decrease down to smaller ones.  You need the larger at the base before you reach the top.  It is also how you build a plausible story.

In this film we learn that most white cops are bad, most black people are paranoid, and most prejudices are suddenly caught like a flu bug, instead of built over through one's life from childhood to adulthood.  The cast is great but the script gets so out of control that none of it even seems realistic.  Bullock's character can be seen as plausible, but then again it tries to build larger plots from a rant she has in the kitchen about the repairman's tattoos.

The characters were too flat an unbelievable, the situations too fantastic to seem plausible, and that god-awful music seemed to dictate when I should experience moments of intense emotion. The treatment of this complex societal problem was too general and contrived. What is left over in the viewer is merely scenes of suspense and wonder, a Hollywood film a little too pretentious to be a true commentary.",1172793600,12,602,5.03
2358579,1,B000A3XY5A,"I've read reviews for the film in the local paper and seen such examples from the film such as:

You are involved in a car accident on a busy street.  The other driver is Asian.  Do you:

a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay.

b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver.

c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!""

If you picked C, you'd love Crash.

Without making too much of a big review, I have to say that Crash is quite a disaster of a film.  The characters are stereotypes of racism without much to their lives except treating every racial encounter, whether actual or not, as a horror story worthy of a track of music with a sad female vocalization as if someone had just died (same female vocalization used for Defeat music in Rome: Total War)

Aside from the stereotypes of people, the way people react to one another is an almost garish, highly unrealistic depiction of modern-day racism.  I'm a city-dweller, and I've lived in New York City and now in Miami.  Maybe I have no say in the matter, but I think it's quite a bit unrealistic to have people screaming ""GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY TOWEL-HEAD!"" at an Arab shop-owner just because he wants you to fix his front door when you're only qualified to fix the windows, and his english is not very good, or to have a man say to his hispanic wife when finding out she was Puerto Rican or Mexican or something, ""Who taught all you people to park on your front lawns?""

It's almost a crime that this pretentious, manipulative film beat out such contenders as Brokeback Mountain, Walk the Line, and others.  It'd be an even bigger crime if the likes of Babel, which follows the same vein of brutal emotional manipulation with a vague, almost irrelevant message of ""we're all connected"".

It does indeed take shots against these things but the shots are sometimes lost among the shots against just about everyone else. Just about everyone is portrayed in the worst possible light and this includes all of the racial stereotypes anyone could ever ask for.

The story, such as it is, follows the lives of a large group of mostly unrelated people. They have only the tenuous connection with each other and are brought together by a car crash. In each case, some of the worst aspects of culture and humanity are showcased. It can be brutal and ugly but it is very well done. There are a few bright moments as well.

2358611,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash was a surprise winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2006.  It's a message movie and the Academy obviously liked the message.  The message is that racial intolerance is untenable if you really stop to think about it and see people from some point of view other than your own.

What makes this work is a brilliant conception and adroit direction by John Haggis, a believable script by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and fine film editing by Hughes Winborne.  All three won Oscars.  They were able to preach, as it were, without preaching.  By putting people in positions of racial and ethnic irony, they show us that racial prejudice is absurd.  We see events that could happen to anyone regardless of race or ethnicity.  We also see that supposed stereotypical behavior that we may hold against another race or ethnic group is sometimes exactly what we do themselves.  The movie points to the truth that everybody is prejudice in one way or another.

The story itself is about several people whose lives accidentally come together (""crash"") in the ethnically and racially diverse, sprawling City of the Angels.  There are two young black guys who could pass for UCLA students (they think since they're in the Westwood area) who hijack the SUV of an LA politico, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) as he and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) are driving home.  There's a double irony here because one of the guys is complaining that people are afraid of them because they're black in a white neighborhood even as they move toward the hijacking!  Later we meet the mother of one of the black guys whose brother Graham (Don Cheadle) is an LAPD detective who tells his mother he's bedding a white woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who he thinks is Mexican, oblivious of the fact that her parents are from Puerto Rico and El Salvador!

There's quite a bit of this ironic confusion about race and ethnicity in the movie, the point being people tend to see others as stereotypes of skin color and language without really being aware of who that person is as an individual.  A Persian shopkeeper is thought of as Arab.  Hindus are thought to be Muslim.  Thais are Chinese.  Ignorance is the basis of racial and ethnic prejudice, is part of Haggis's message.  And he's right.

One of the most beautiful sequences in the movie begins when Shereen (Marina Sirtis) buys some bullets in a gunshop for her father, the Persian shopkeeper.  (Pay attention to those bullets!)  Later we see Daniel (Michael Pena) talking to his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez) who is hiding under her bed because she is afraid of the bullets that used to go off in her old neighborhood.  Daniel gives her his invisible, impenetrable cloak to wear to protect her, taking it off and putting it around her.  Later when the Persian shopkeeper comes hunting Daniel because he thinks Daniel tore up his store, Lara runs to protect her dad who no longer has the impenetrable cloak!  I won't tell you want happens.  You have got to see the sequence yourself.

Matt Dillon plays a racially prejudice cop who could pass for a young and less sophisticated real life ex-LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman of O. J. Simpson trial infamy.  He is the central character in another interesting sequence beginning with his groping shakedown of a black man's wife.

The stories meld together in a way that reflects how Los Angeles is a cultural melting pot--or is it a salad bowl?  The stories that intertwine bring out the underlining preconceptions and prejudices of the people of that salad bowl (or melting pot) in a way that is more effective than a dissertation or documentary might be.  Yes, there is some contrivance, but I think it's fair to write that off as poetic license.

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that although it won the Best Picture Oscar it only cost about $6-million to make.  It's one of the most original films I've seen in quite a while and one of the most effective.",1170633600,4,3940,4.713450292397661

2358615,5,B000A3XY5A,"This tense urban drama set in Los Angeles opens with a car wreck that serves as a metaphor for the collisions between ordinary people because of the racist rage that underlies their particular English vernaculars, work, dress, music, marriage and family. A Persian shop keeper (""They think we're Arabs!""), a Hispanic locksmith, two black hoodlums, a wealthy black film director, redneck white trash, a despicable suburban white couple, a naive white rookie cop, and other ethnic typecasts are all trapped in stereotypes that they project on to others, paranoia (not all of which is unjustified), bigotry, and mutual misunderstanding. In this film good people are bad and bad people are good, and most everyone is a mixture of the two. A corrupt cop who molested a woman he apprehended later rescues her from a burning vehicle with professionalism, bravery and genuine compassion: ""You think you know who you are,"" he tells a younger cop, ""but just wait a few years."" He rages at a black HMO clerk but at home tenderly cares for his dying father. Accidental encounters and random events ""crash"" these fallible human beings into one another in a world void of all political correctness. Director Paul Haggis does an excellent job of showing the corrosive power of racism not only between people but even among people who are otherwise from the same ""group.""",1169596800,,1355,5.0
2358616,5,B000A3XY5A,"The subject of racism is a touchy one. Many people don't like to delve in for fear of being labeled or accused. In Crash, the subject is taken on by writer/director Paul Haggis with daring and relentless ambition.

Crash is one of those movies where several stories are taking place in once city and tend to intertwine with one another. As the film opens we see two young black men complaining about how a woman walks closer to her husband because she saw the two of them walking toward them. What they do next is complete 180 on what you would expect and sets the tone for the entire movie.  After complaining about being seen as stereotypical racial criminals, they carjack the couple of their Lincoln SUV.

It may not seem like the stereotypes are gone, but they are used as a set up for all the twists and turns that make this movie a slalom of racial archetypes and expectations, only to be turned on their head once established. You might think Haggis' intention is to show you that racism is out there and it's wrong, but beyond that he shows that it exists on all sides of the social structures. He also shows third dimensions to the characters, giving them reasons for their actions, whether justifiable or not, and makes sure you see sides of the characters that contradict with the stereotypes.

You've never seen these actors plays parts like this. Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock stand out as the most shocking, reflecting rich white elitists who have different reactions to being carjacked. Don Cheadle gives a great performance playing well off Jennifer Espisito as their affair turns nasty in a very intimate scene. All the other actors turn in great performances as well; Terrance Howard, Matt Dillion, Thandie Newton, Ludacris and Ryan Phillippe are all in great form, but not all of them have remarkably substantial parts. Everyone seemed to want to be in this movie for it's message, and that is the star of the film.

You can get a lot of different things out of this film, it has many messages, some will be relevant to you but not to others. It is a hard look at racism on all levels and not just at the street level.  It points out the flaws of humanity in a city that is racially and socially distraught.  This movie makes you think, whether you thinks it's really good not.  I thought it was excellent because I believe we need to look inward as much as outward when it comes to eliminating racism.",1169510400,,2426,4.573732718894009

2358641,2,B000A3XY5A,"I'm not sure why some people like this film.  A few ""serious"" critics whose opinion I generally respect, e.g., David Denby of the New Yorker he also praised the recent ""Dreamgirls"" to the heavens) liked this film a lot.  At the same time, A.O. Scott of the New York Times, Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times, and many others thought it was execrable.

I wanted to pop the DVD back into the DVD player to play back a few scenes that had been commented upon (favorably) or seemed to have made a deep impression on some.  BUT I COULDN'T!  [...]I think the cliches pop out in too obvious a fashion and would make a repeat viewing painful.  Once was enough--""I get the idea.""  And it's surprisingly shallow.

A far more convincing study of the inexorable nexus--linking chain of events--of character, events, culture, timing, and fate itself was the 2004 film ""House of Sand and Fog"" with Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly.

I found the intoning over the soundtrack of Don Cheadle sententious AND pretentious, to say the least, and the sappy ""moralizing"" that suddenly pops out of the mouths of different characters pretty heavy-handed:  ""You think you know who you are.  You have no idea..."" (what exactly is the motivation for Matt Dillon to say this to Ryan Phillipe, except that it will be a commentary on an ensuing vignette with Phillipe and one of the black rappers) or for Cheadle to spout at the beginning ""People in L.A. just crash[-ing] into each other to feel something.""

In retrospect, the dialog is not spoken by real people, unless we all speak in ""sound bites"" or maxims about the world.  People DO fly off the handle, certainly do have feelings about race, even if they are largely unexpressed (even to themselves, and rarely, to the person they have those feelings about!), but this film is very contrived in more ways than one.

As others have noted, subtlety is not this film's strong card...

Lots of sound and fury, yes, exciting confrontations (""crashes""), but the characters, no matter how sharply delineated they were by the actors, were no more than television-style cardboard-cut-outs.

Others have mentioned the corny, annoying Enya-esque music soundtrack, the very trite slow-motion photography at the ""significant (read: tear-jerk) moments,"" the excessive Daddy-love-me, and the other abundant forms of hand-wringing, heart-tugging in this film.  I agree--but at least those overt instances of pretty bad taste/sloppiness are congruent with the general mediocrity of the entire effort.  It does get pretty BAD at times, especially as the film unwinds and the novelty of the violent confrontations wears off and ennui predominates (""seen this, heard this, done this before..."").

In fact, Paul Haggis's background in television really does show itself, as most of the segments are built a time frame of about 6- to 10-minutes, the segment of a dramatic television serious before a commercial break.  A LOT has to happen within those minutes to keep the television audience tuned in and not change channels.  Maybe with the profanity and expletives removed, it really WOULD play out as a made-for-television movie.

The interlocking vignettes that come full circle, after I had thought about it, are a form straight from the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler's ""La Ronde.""

The novelty of the ""[...]-kicking crashes"" wears off within time, especially as they seemed to be paired up, in alternation, with pretty mawkish segments (girl with the red cape, Matt Dillon with his father, Sandra Bullock hugging her maid, etc.).

Is this what ""real"" life is supposed to be like?  Or is this a sort of moral parable?  Or a compendium of the ""worst"" moments (and if so, why?  just for rhetorical effect)?  Or, more likely, is it a ""fantasy"" concocted in the mind of screenwriter/director Paul Haggis?

I think what is the most dismaying about this film is that a lot of white people, college students, people in mostly white communities, away from the reality of urban life, will say to themselves:  ""Oh, my, gosh!  This is what racism is REALLY like!  Now I get it!  This is really what happens to black people every day!"" as if this film is a very accurate portrayal of race relations in this country.

Purportedly this film is trying to shatter notions of racism and stereotypes.  But in doing so, it comes across as being as didactic and Manichean as the Roman Catholic Church by sheer dint of portraying one day in the life of Los Angeles as a series of over-the-top racial confrontations alternately with sappy snapshots of the other ""hidden"" facet of the same set of characters.  Jekyll is really Hyde.  Granted, Haggis is trying to do something with an ensemble cast that Robert Altman did in many of HIS films.  But I don't recall Altman ever being so obvious, so flat-footed, so ""this is the message.""

But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences liked it because it is ultimately just a reflection of the kind of self-congratulatory staring-at-one's-navel that the Oscars are famous for.

Another thing: I think Asian-Americans, who make up approximately  10% of the population of California, are portrayed very in very stereotypical terms--either as first-generation immigrants or illegal aliens, all of whom speak English with thick accents.

As an Asian-American, I recognized to some of the ""SURFACE"" racial issues, but I don't think they were dealt with in depth at all.  The picture ""Crash"" presents of racism in America does NOT reflect my own personal experiences except in very CRUDE and brutal ways.  (As a matter of fact, I have experienced ""tons more"" racism and prejudice from African-Americans, as opposed to Africans, than Caucasians).

It certainly doesn't reflect the political correctness and complexity of racial/ethnic interactions here in Seattle.  I recognize some of the explosive anger, misunderstanding, etc. in this film, but I think the movie was ""undone"" by the pretty ""stock"" situations that are not presented with great originality.

Yes, L.A. apparently lives on adrenaline, fast cars, and this film, while capturing that aspect,  seems to rely too much on ""shock and awe"" posturing that appears implausible upon reflection.  Superficial, panoramic but certainly not profound in the sense that I don't think it offered any particularly new insights on the topic (the ostensible raison d'etre of this film.

The ""redemption"" theme (made emphatic by the corny chorus of angels heard over the soundtrack) was really quite far-fetched and unearned.  Just a way little TOO glib, simple-minded.

Someone, please, tell me how this film contributes to a discussion of race  and ethnicity in this country?

It's disturbing to think that there are people living in parts of the country where there isn't a mixture of races and ethnicities will say to themselves: ""A-HA!  This explains racism, this is an accurate picture of race as it is lived in America.""",1167782400,18,6911,5.025483304042179

Every character was completely ignorant and discriminatory to the fullest extent. Everytime I thought there would be a breakthrough in a character's situation, it just got worse and worse. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and furthermore, I couldn't believe people would recommend this movie. There was nothing in this movie that could spark an INTELLIGENT discussion of ethnicity, heritage or class.

The African-Americans were portrayed as oversexed, very violent people that couldn't care less about having morals or being culturally educated. I really hated that.

Latinos were portrayed as also sexual objects (Don Cheadle's girlfriend), rough, poor, and came from a bad background, a bad neighborhood, a bad rep.

Caucasians were the instigators, not necessarily the ""bad guys"" but bad nonetheless. They were intolerant and naive, extremely paranoid and extremely ridiculous in their actions and their explanations for those actions.

The token Arabs in this film were actually Persian, which had to be explained. See, when a script involves an explanation for some scenes in which the characters have to tell the audience something they should be able to catch on to, then there is no fluidity to the dialogue and in this case, the entire film.

The East Asians weren't given the time of day in ""Crash,"" and I felt bad that they were mostly props or just mere additions to the cast.

If the creators of this film planned on being dedicated to showing what real people of varied ethnicities go through on a day to day basis and showing their real personalities and true colors, then they failed immensely.

I can only assume some of the reviewers who said they didn't ""get it"" or found this movie exaggerated or ""untrue""...are White (as am I) and have had only limited exposure to the racism that DOES exist in this country.

I had no idea how prevalent the sorts of goings-on depicted in this movie really are until I moved to a major city on the East coast, lived in a predominantly Hispanic community, dated someone of Dominican heritage, and befriended people of different races and backgrounds.  I was present to experience first-hand and hear real-life accounts of things that happened to my Latino and African-American friends; I've been the recipient of questioning looks by maitre d's and wait staff - not to mention passersby on the streets of NYC and Boston - as to why this blonde woman was with a man who looked nothing like her; likewise I saw the looks these friends received.  I also realized how small-minded some of my suburban friends are, as was I until I lived a different life.

This movie is poignant, intelligent, darkly witty, and does an incredible job articulating how some of the characters think or assume they are not racist only to show they are.  It is artistically and beautifully tied together to show how humanly fragile each of us is and ""should"" give one cause to examine their own thoughts and behaviors in situations involving people of different ethnicities.  This movie ""should"" give one cause to be empathetic toward others and realize you have no idea what life experiences someone else has had that scarred or jaded them to think or behave in certain ways.

It would have had a run of no more than a month---and then sent to the video stores.  Few people would be aware of its existence.  The script writing of Crash reminds me of the efforts of an immature college student who is convinced that the United States remains a very racist nation.

None of the story lines ring true.  The Matt Dillon white racist cop character, for instance, hasn't existed in this country since the late 1950s.  There is no way that a Los Angeles police officer in the 21st century dares to sexually fondle a woman during a non-threatening traffic stop.  Crash is a collection of hyperbolic vignettes created merely to entertain those left of center ""elites"" who are ideologically committed to the notion that America's racial relations have not dramatically improved in the last fifty years.  You do not need to see Crash.  I'm sure that you can find better things to do with your time.

2358678,2,B000A3XY5A,"When this came out it was all the rage.  Didn't it win or get nominated for an Oscar?  So I guess a film like this is still considered exotic and cutting edge.  I sure don't know why.  Maybe some people have yet to understand that multiculturalism in a ghetto doesn't work.  The stream of consciousness script suffers from a deep dependency on trying to be cute and tricky by throwing in an anomaly here and there, but it fails miserably as these are just silly contrivances.  The black youth who is into country music, hitch hiking a ride back to the city from the valley after ice-skating and confessing his dream of being a goalie is shot and killed by the white driver who thinks the youth has a gun, it turns out to be a skate key.  Another laughable moment is the hot car parts guy offering to buy the Cambodian immigrants from the [black] car thief who subsequently ""frees"" them instead of taking the money.  C'mon give me a break!  In the modern PC world people are much more subtle then this.  The dialogue and story line is just silly at times.

Stereotypes are generalities about a race or culture.  There is a reason why stereotypes exist.  It's because they are generally true.  But is the issue really race and culture or is it one of class?  Either way I say so what?  This film wants you to feel guilty about the occasional racial slip of the tongue or for leaving the city and moving out to the suburbs where you lose touch.  Believe me I lived in the pit of hell called LA for far too long.  Crime is rampant, the schools are disgusting and worthless, and the bureaucrats are just getting fatter and fatter.  I used to wake up angry all the time too.  So I left and I make no apologies for it.  Do I reside in a super white bread upper middle class community?  You bet, and guess what, no crime, great public schools, low taxes, and no more anger.  Is that just a coincidence; I think not.  Bad people live in the world.  They come in all colors and from all cultures, but they are generally poor, uneducated, and live in overpopulated urban areas.  Throwing out a racial epithet under the heat of the moment doesn't make you a racist...it makes you human and fallible and one seeking immediate, cheap emotional gratification.  Don't feel guilty about it.  This flick is a waste of time.  In the end heavy handed clichs and a preachy ""can't wall all just get along"" mess packaged in two long hours is all you get.  Two stars only for the decent acting by all.",1166918400,15,2477,4.380219780219781
2358679,4,B000A3XY5A,"The acting is top notch, and the stories are interwoven nicely. It has a beautiful soundtrack and editing, too. However, it's preachy about morals which are probably self-evident to most, but could be a revelation to some. Character development is strong enough that the director could make separate movies about the characters for more depth, which is something you might want--more depth. There are some certified tear-jerker scenes; however, it's not a masterpiece, because the Hollywood-style message about race and morality (which sets the bar for morality pretty low) kept intruding on 5 or more good stories. Some reviewers have complained the characters, ironically, have themselves been painted with a stereotypical brush. And, I have to admit the portrayal of Asians was as subtle as a sledgehammer hit to the groin. Also, there are absurd moments, like when actor LudiCris frees Cambodian slaves rather then sell them. LudiCris smiles to himself, knowing he's done the right thing. Well, 'atta boy! This scene is simply--yes, I am going there--ludicrous. Like I said, the morality bar is just inches off the ground. Also, the scene where Sandra Bullock declares that her maid is her best friend reduces her character to the lowest levels of patheticism, because her paid employee--who can not flee her for financial reasons--accomodates pretty much all her fickle wishes, even that of being her best friend.

I wanted to like this movie much more than I did, but the message of racism was watered down and not that original. In comparison, the movie, ""New Jack City"" punched harder at a gut level with less obvious ""serious"" preaching and got a much stronger point across, and yet it still cleverly came off as a wild action movie, not a studied elite cultural statement. Crash is just another example of message overwhelming otherwise good art, because the director didn't trust the audience to get it. Adding up all of this, it's still a great movie well worth watching, flaws and all.",1166227200,,1998,5.054545454545455

It was the same old story about racism.  I'm not saying these things don't still happen, because I know they do. The scene where Matt Dillon saved the life of the woman he'd previously molested was very touching, and the reason I gave the movie four stars.

I find most of the acting powerful and strong-- and was particularly impressed with Matt Dillon and  Don Cheadle.(And that lovely scene about the protective cape is simply extraordinary writing.) I find Paul Haggis' intentions to discuss issues of prejudice admirable, but, in the end, I am disappointed.  First of all I cannot handle the mixing of race and ethnicity as if one was the same as the other.  (At least the Latina/Hispanic/ Chicana character gets that one sorta right!)  I also cannot handle the inevitable mingling of all of these people in encounters with each other in a place as big as Los Angeles in such a short period of time. I suspect that Haggis has some theory about plot and parable that he is trying out here. This may make that work for some--but for me is simply does not hold up.  Haggis has good intentions but the road to............etc.  But.....I would like to see this film in the company of others, because I doubt that the reactions will be subtle.

2358684,1,B000A3XY5A,"One should not be fooled by this supposedly ""thought-provoking"" movie focused on minorities in America. What this movie is trying to do is obvious: fostering the existing racial prejudice toward people from middle-east (e.g. easily angered, irrational, childish and resort to violence even though the problem is caused by oneself, a all-too-obvious biased parallel with Israeli-Arab conflicts), African-Americans (most likely robbers, but cool, females  are typically sexially drawn to White people), and Chinese people (problem with English pronunciation -- it seems that the director doesn't even know that only Japanese have problem distinguishing ""r"" and ""l"" because the consonant ""r"" is not in Japanese, while Korean and Chinese don't --; typically pushy, live in Chinatown, either smuggling or being smuggled to this country from places with no electricity, and is even pitied by Black robbers -- the most insulting depiction out of what the three ethnic groups receive)

The producer probably thinks it is OK to release this kind of movie because he or she thinks movies do not sell to Chinese anyway because of piracy, and middle easterner is a very small percentage of the population with very little dispensable income. The target audience probably consists of white lower-middle class people with less than average education, Hispanics which this movie treats with some respect (e.g. the key maker, a huge difference from other minority groups), and some black people with low self esteem.

Even though the producer's observation is not that off the mark and the movie probably is economically successful, the act of making this kind of movie is ethically in the same league as OJ's latest book.",1164585600,14,1706,5.311111111111111
2358685,5,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH offers up a sinister 36-hour cruise through L.A.'s mean streets, reveling in the squallor, evil, and selfish sights along the way.  The stories that unfold in the movie are so true to life that they hurt.  Waters, a black homicide detective, has to deal with his addicted mother and law-breaking brother while trying to be a fair man in an unfair world.  Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play two of the chosen few to reach to the top of the ladder of success only to find out that they're hollow and not people the audience will root for.  Ludicris turns in a solid performance as a black heister out to avenge the wrongs done by the white world.

Paul Haggis wrote the compelling script, layering in the stories like Chinese boxes, so that when you open one, there's another.  Each of them are tied tightly together, and none of them effectively work without the other pieces making the experience whole.  A gamut of big-name stars worked on the film, bringing this failing world to light and splitting it right down the middle over issues of race and wealth and privilege.

The Blu-Ray presentation is absolutely amazing, which is why you'll want to pick this disc up even if you've already got the movie.  The picture is top-shelf, beautifully presented.  Though the sound quality isn't uncompressed the way movies should be packaged on the Blu-ray and the HD DVD releases (which studios haven't yet made a standard), it is exceptional and moving.

CRASH is harsh, abrupt, and hard to take.  But it is also compelling drama that will keep you frozen in place watching to see how everything all works out.",1163635200,6,1615,4.708185053380783

But, if you're as ill-exposed to some of the ethinic groups represented in the film as I am, the film can come close to convincing you that it's just brimming with valid points and challenging ideas.  Truth be told, it's not.  Crash is, in a word, hip.  Mainstream.  Overly simplified.  A single serving of ""wow, I should be more open-minded and accepting"" for today's Americans.  This is by no means a terrible film, but's a far cry from the moral index so many of its acolytes tout it to be.  Required viewing for universities?  Nonsense!

On another note, as a Korean teenager, I found the middle-aged Korean couple's miraculous ability to speak fluent English near the end somewhat patronizing.  I think the audience could have taken the 7 seconds worth of subtitles.  As for me, that misstep killed some of the film's credibility.

Just for the record, if I hadn't been watching this film with someone, the scenes with the little girl's cloak would have made me cry a bit.  I know this review's all over the place, so here's the final word: solid movie, great production (though hardly deserving of Best Picture), and don't see it as a bible for dealing with other ethinic groups.

2358726,5,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH is a movie about race and ethnicity in L.A. However, the film is more than that. It's also a movie about how we are all connected to each other and that despite the differences in our skin color, cultural heritage, and lifestyle choices we are more alike than we would like to admit.

The movie is an ensemble film that examines a wide variety of people in different parts of L.A. The film illustrates how their lives interact, or crash into each other, and how the varied views of race and culture come into play throughout their lives. There are times that the movie is quite violent and even without the violence, the film is still rather harsh because of its brutal honesty. The film has been criticized because its portrayal of race has been said to be riddled with stereotypes and generalizations. There is some truth to the criticisms, but just a nugget. CRASH uses the stereotypes and generalizations that so many of we Americans use and throws it in our face to show us how wrong we can be and how we are only crippling ourselves.

CRASH opens with a car crash and ends with another. These crashes are literal, but they are also metaphorical as to what happens throughout the movie. A young man is shot. A white couple is carjacked. A Hispanic man tries to protect his daughter from gang violence in their neighborhood. A respected black couple are pulled over by a white cop who physical abuses the wife. A black police officer finds it a challenge to communicate with his Puerto Rican lover. A middle Eastern man tries to protect his business from neighborhood thugs. Each of these characters lives interact with one another. Most of them are oblivious to how connected they are but some become aware of the beauty and wonder of life as their lives crash into each other.

CRASH was written and directed by Paul Haggis. He was inspired to write the film after he and his wife were carjacked. Haggis is an extremely talented writer he brings the characters to life and fills them with a realistic vitality so that the characters rise above the expected stereotypes they are presumed to be. Not only that, but Haggis uses some brilliant film techniques to keep the action of the film moving. With an ensemble cast of around twenty major characters, CRASH could have easily become bogged down, but Haggis doesn't allow that. The story keeps moving and like life itself, each moment is fresh.

The ensemble cast includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Tony Danza, Loretta Devine, Matt Dillon, Michael Pena, Jennifer Eposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillippe to just name a few. CRASH won the 2005 Oscar for Best Picture as well as the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

The film is not for everyone. It moves in a linear fashion, but instead of focusing on just a few characters weaves it's tale through many characters. I know there are some people who do not enjoy this type of filmmaking. However, if you don't mind the linear story from multiple perspectives and wish to watch an excellent drama that deals with race issues honestly, then CRASH is a movie you will want to see.",1161820800,,3129,4.692167577413479

I saw this film in a racially mixed theatre. We all laughed at ourselves and each other, and then we moved to gasps and tears, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who openly sobbed. This is the best it gets and shows why the film medium is so powerful.

I've sat through a lot of sensitivity training at work and school and this should be required. It's a first step in honesty toward encouraging not only better race relations, but real relations. It's in my all-time top five--and not because it was easy to watch--but because I needed to.

Both qualities will be shown throughout one's life. And racism is so much more than color of our skin. The movie shows that even a mother can be a racist toward her own children.

2358735,4,B000A3XY5A,"I liked Crash, but I think it came within a whisker of being purposely manipulative, and I'll say for sure that it went for the quick gratification of easy praise rather than taking a few more chances and truly breaking into courageous new ground on the subject of racial issues. Had it done that, I'd have no problems ranking this as a five-star modern masterpiece.

In my opinion Crash's saving grace had less to do with what it tried to say and more to do with how it was said. By that I mean its slick, successful use of what was almost a single time-warping plot branching out and weaving in its many interconnecting edges was far more interesting in its complexity than what was actually happening within the movie itself. And unlike every film that's employed this ""layered"" technique in the last dozen years, I didn't get the feeling it was either ripping off or paying homage to Pulp Fiction: Crash found its own identity.

As for its message (and make no mistake, this wasn't just storytelling, it had a message) to be honest I found that at times exploitive. Plus that whole defining theme of how strangers deliberately cause car wrecks in order to meet people and gain human contact? That was not only implausible, it wasn't even explored within the movie, just mentioned and left dangling. The situations, characters and events in Crash employed caricatures and broadly-painted stereotypes without any real complexity to them. We were treated to individuals straight out of mass market fiction: the bigoted cop with his moment of personal salvation; the angry white-collar black man; the flimsy, self-showcasing DA; the wronged white woman who lashed out; the Asian who can't drive; the persecuted Muslim, etc etc etc. Not once did the filmmakers go out on a limb and present a person in a role generally considered foreign to stereotypes of his or her ethnicity. There is also the question of whether a project like Crash explores sensitive social issues, or feeds the beast of racism, particularly, perhaps, by lending a sense of justification to an existing extra-racial persecution complex common among all Americans today.

Crash certainly entertains with top-notch acting and its polished story that makes you extremely interested in how it is all going to come out, but in the end it has little to teach us about our own perceptions of others or about the private lives of those who share this county with us. But then again, sometimes telling an engrossing story is really all its fair to ask from a movie, Crash achieved this, and that's why I gave it four stars.",1158278400,5,2585,4.830699774266366

And with some research I found out that it won the Oscar for best movie in 2005. It's fully deserving. It's not only in L.A. Look at the Middle East and the ethnic and racial problems of prejudice there. There is a huge problem in the world! And at its roots is a deep hatred between color and cultures. Paul Haggis took on this explosive theme head-on in his amazingly seamless screen-play, moving-making at its most daring and challenging best. Art is not only just to entertain and bring comfort; it's supposed to challenge us to look at ourselves in relationship to life and see if we just might be part of the problem because of our own unrecognized prejudices. So I'm sorry to see what I consider such shallow negative reactions to this great film. Who hasn't been a victim of someone's preconceived idea of who they thought we were? And the film has a positive message: it emphasizes that it just might be possible for people to *change.* This change must start from within, and for humanity as a whole it's overdue by a few centuries.

Sorry, but much of the unusually number of low ratings for this film, including on Amazon.com, appear to be from the upset gay community who wanted Brokeback Mountain to be top winner. The irony is that gays suffer from the same cultural or racial prejudices that are so brilliantly explored in Crash, and I think they have been extremely short-sighted by knocking an incredibly challenging theme to handle well and such an important one. Why can't people love both movies, rather than making it a ridiculous either or proposition over a stupid award? Both are worthy films, and it was CRASH that had a *much larger theme* than to that which is primarily related to gender and one's sexual orientation. While the theme of both films are important, maybe one is supposed to believe that it's sexual orientation they are warring about in Iraq, Israel and Lebanon rather than the racial, religious and cultural prejudices of the last 2000 years. Those who have expressed their displeasure by secretly voting a low rating and downplaying this great film with unnatural negative reviews might try to broaden their perspective of the world.

The film looks fine, sounds fine and is well-acted, and other reviews here will outline the who-and-what, so I'll merely leave you with a parting thought. A few years ago, a black man named Rodney King was severely beaten by LA cops. The incident was caught on camera and the police were initially acquitted by a largely white jury. This resulted in rioting in African-American neighborhoods, which cost one caucasian truck driver his life (wrong place, wrong time)and ruined many a business in the area (many owned by Koreans and Asians). If that true-life sequence of events didn't lead to revolutionary changes in people's attitudes (on all sides), an over-rated, but watchable, feature film will not begin to scratch the surface, despite its makers' smug post-Oscar posturing.",1155513600,50,1563,4.961832061068702

At first I did not want to see it, but I am glad I did.  It opened my eyes.  Some people don't want to realize that racism still exists, and this movies let's us all know that it still does, but we as a people can try and change our misconceptions about other races.

The only thing I can think of is that the liberal Hollywood elite wants Americans to think that there is still a tremendous amount of civil strive between races.

Only after they played the clip during the Oscar show did I realize I had rented & watched it months before.  I guess the positive reviewers are half right: It doesn't present the racial issues ""in black & white""- but only in the sense that it doesn't make all the white characters sophisticated and the minority characters blackface caricatures.  There are negative reviews here which seem to presume that racism is a relic of the past, which is patently absurd.  It is a very real issue, one which affects all of us (usually in more subtle ways than Haggis seems to understand) which is not going anywhere soon.  At the same time, every character in the movie seems to have an obsessive racial awareness which controls everything they do.  The characters have no depth at all outside of their racial attitude.  As a result, the theme is so prevalent that the movie plays like an after-school special.  If you want to see a candid and thought-provoking movie about racial relations, check out ""American History X"" with Ed Norton.

I was haunted. I laughed. I felt morose. Crash took me through a range of emotions and reminded me of my own shortcomings and strengths. What a wonderful movie of loss, renewal, weakness, strength and the human condition we all suffer from and love being trapped in.

2358774,4,B000A3XY5A,"With an ensemble cast of mostly B and C list stars, CRASH is a film about the intersecting lives and racial prejudices of random people in Los Angeles -- from a district attorney and a shopkeeper to a locksmith and television director.

Though few have anything in common with each other, their lives collide in stressful situations and as a result, most of them hatefully reveal their own pre-conceived ideas about ethnicity, religion and skin color.

Because CRASH won an Academy-award and has been reviewed endlessly there is little point in saying more about the plot.  But what is worth discussing is writer/director Paul Hagis's intentions in making this film.

After seeing CRASH a few times, I wonder if he hoped to position it as a water cooler discussion provoker a la ""Do the Right Thing.""  I wonder this because with the exception of two characters, everyone depicted in this film is both heroic and demonic.  A good example is the Matt Damon character, a rapist (and racist) cop who struggles to care for his ailing father.  There are at least 10 other examples of this kind of multi-layered character development.

But two characters, a maid and a locksmith, are sterling characters throughout the film.  They suffer prejudice and yet they succeed in rising above the 'kick the dog' mentality that afflicts the rest of the cast of characters.

Because I cannot imagine what message Hagis is trying to convey in reserving these two characters as pure (is he passionately pro-Latino?) I do not believe CRASH is nearly as great as many have found it.  Still I recommend the film.

By far the most moving character in this film was the latino locksmith, mainly because he wasn't given horrible, over-the-top lines and (like that other small film, Brokeback Mountain) conveyed more through his actions and reactions than the other more overt characters.

While I have no doubt that clashes between races such as those depicted in the film happen around the world on a daily basis, we would only be so fortunate if real people wore their racism on their sleeves as visibly as the characters in this film.  In reality, racism and prejudice are far deeper below the surface, and the types of epiphanies experienced by the characters in this film come neither as fast (the whole film took place in two days) nor as completely.

A film with such great actors, such brilliant score, so many dazzling stories, such a paradoxical end should not be rubbish. If you don't extract a single piece of advice of this movie, then you don't like movies because you only like straight stories, with a predictable end.

But a film with no tension, no remarkable interpretation, not a good screenplay and very few scenes that make you have deep feelings cannot be an Oscar winner. It's very simple: a memorable film wins five or more Oscars. ""Crash"" only won three.

These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.

The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it.

A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Pea (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.

In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone.",1152921600,2,1685,4.823529411764706

As a piece of entertainment it works as well as anything I've seen in recent times with a driving soundtrack, superb acting and bold visual representation of an alienating LA landscape. There are even a few moments of insight, almost soleley driven by Matt Dillon's character, but it's not enough to start a social debate on and dare I say this film probably had designs on just that, so I can't give it the full 5 stars, instead it's a 4 and abviously recommended to those who haven't seen it.",1152835200,2,1036,4.50531914893617

It's 1-1/2 stars out of four at *best.*  Like so much of Hollywood's social commentary, it says much more about the race and class ideologies of the people who made the movie than it does about the society it attempts to portray.  I'm not saying it doesn't have its moments, but the manner in which race and class issues were addressed were mostly phony, shallow and stereotyped.  At its heart, the movie is just silly, paradoxically made even sillier by its achievement as Best Picture.

Also, basic plotting and storytelling is ignored.  High school seniors could write a better plot.  Here's a literary example: in Les Miserables, you ever notice how Inspector Javert keeps popping up at just the right moment?  You know what that is?  I'm sure there's some fancy English Major name for it, but its common term is ""unexplained coincidence,"" a.k.a. ""clumsy plot device.""  Using unexplained coincidences to goose the plot may have been acceptable for 19th century readers, but I think 21st century audiences expect and deserve better.  When you look at how films like ""Magnolia"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" dealt with intersecting stories, you're looking at at least journeymen screenwriters, who are thoughtful enough to overcome this problem.  Not in Crash, oh no.  Just stick with the clumsy plot devices right to the end.  One cop saves the life of a woman he felt up the night before.  His partner, in a different part of town, saves the life of her husband.  The husband is carjacked by a robber whose partner is shot by the police officer he met the night before.

In fact I can find only one fault with it, and that is replayability. That is only because it is so realistic that when I walk down the street here in Washington D.C. I can see the same issues. Forgive me if this realism is not something I want to see in a movie on a regular basis. It stares me in the face everyday and I am not blind. This is a great movie to see once, but not something I would go back and review on a regular basis. So I highly recommned it for a rental but you need to be a great fan of drama and the darker side of human nature and society to be a steady watcher. I'm guessing this is like the ""Butterfly Effect"" in showing how what one person does can impact many other lives and our mental conditioning based on not only what we are taught but what we learn first hand. One excellent example is the case of the white girl grabbing her husbands arm and moving closer to him when two black men approach them on the street. She has been taught that they are more likely to attack them because of what she hears on the media and from her social group. The irony is they do in fact attack them and reinforce her fear. What is almost funny is the black mens conversation before they attack and one is resentful that the girl draws away from them before in fact they commit the kind of crime that they are stereotyped or profiled for. Just a great job of showing how we are foolish and not so foolish for developing our defense mechanisms when dealing with others. What is truly bold is showing that whites are not the only racist. Racism runs in all colors and cultures and this movie shows that. It gives examples of how some will complain about how they are treated and then be hypocritical and degrade another race and culture. It puts us in touch with the fact that we ""ALL""  need to get beyond the hypocrisy if we are going to work out the problems that are truly important like overcoming the violence and especially killing. I personally will take someone stereotyping me and calling me names over being shot any day thank you very much. Four more shot here on the street yesterday. You tell me where our priorities should lie. Excellent job of making us think about that.",1151452800,5,2349,4.243303571428571
2358833,2,B000A3XY5A,"Following the outcome of the latest Academy Awards with Crash surprising everyone by getting the Oscar for Best Picture, I thought I should perhaps see this film. I watched it with the best intentions and an open mind. I really thought I would like it because I knew it dealt with an interesting subject matter.

Unfortunately, the truth is that, while watching Crash, I really had the impression that I was simply watching a TV program, some kind of ""bad cop/good cop"" TV show. Nonetheless, I still found Crash to be an OK movie, a ""movie with good intentions"", but overall, just an ordinary made-for-TV movie. I thought it was too simplistic and, in some ways, childish in its treatment & development to be worthy of any significant praise. The first line uttered by Don Cheadle at the beginning of the film is so unnatural, unrealistic, and moralizing that my reaction was: ""What?! Do they think we're stupid?"" The problem with this film is that it is ""pushing"" a moral. It aims to carry a ""message"" and does so without finesse or subtlety. It is done so that the ""not-so-bright"" gets the message, i.e. ""we're all racists, let's all love and accept one another, ... and, if necessary, let's crash into one another in order to touch one another""(!). I personally do not particularly like ""preachy"" movies and, Crash IS preachy. This film could really have been entitled ""Racism 101"", ""Racism for Dummies"", or even better ""Racist Stereotypes - Advanced Level"". Mind you, I do not live in LA nor in the US, and I realize that such a film is perhaps necessary.

I really thought that the storyline was ""un-believable"". This sequence of coincidences is so contrived and artificial that, after just a few minutes, you can clearly see the pattern established, you can predict the ""surprises"" and, as the film goes on, you then automatically expect the ""unexpected"". It seems like the makers of this film are simply trying too hard. It considerably reduces the credibility of the film.

It is un-believable that this film won the Oscar for Best Picture. How did that happen?! In any case, the Oscars have hit a new low.

It is un-believable, and sad, that the Academy actually fell for the persistent and aggressive Oscar campaign orchestrated by the producers of Crash. Actually, the simple thought that these awards are earned through of a pushy ""Oscar campaign"" makes me wince... So much for the credibility of poor old Oscar.

Let's face it, Crash did create quite a ""coup"" on Oscar night for a movie that had quickly sunk into oblivion last summer. After all, it only ranked 58th in the 2005 year-end compilation of film reviews in the March issue of Premiere Magazine and was not even nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes. Despite the fact that Crash addresses the touchy issue of racism in LA, many reviews in reputed publications, including the LA Times, were rather negative mentioning how manipulative and unrealistic it was, and how it ""exploited stereotypes"". After watching the movie, I personally felt as if I probably needed to be more wary of people of other races. I felt that it only ""reinforced"" and ""validated"" existing negative stereotypes. Now, was that the intention of the film? I doubt it, but facile stereotypes are used without any restraint throughout.

In the end, I think that host Jon Stewart summed it up pretty well on Oscar night when, in order to save time, he said ""Whoever was NOT in Crash, please raise your hands"". He simply reminded us that Crash is ABOUT LA, was shot IN LA, and gave work to A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM LA, and of course, all these people FROM LA voted for themselves, probably also getting the votes of their colleagues and friends in the film industry (everybody would have done the same). But, was Crash really the Best Picture of 2005? I think that the answer is pretty clear and obvious: NO.

After receiving over two dozens of Best Picture Awards around the world, the extraordinary and unforgettable Brokeback Mountain should of course have won the Academy Award for Best Picture which it truly deserved. An upset of this magnitude is without precedent in Oscar history and, it is simply unjustifiable and scandalous. Everybody seemed extremely surprised, even, of course, the Crash winners. Brokeback Mountain was from the start simply outnumbered in this specific ""LA-based"" organization which is, as it just proved, very self-centered and preoccupied in glorifying itself. It was clearly demonstrated, once again, that in the Academy, ""inside politics"" and other dubious factors have more importance over true artistic value. The Academy has completely discredited itself.

I personally think that, as Crash's big Oscar rival, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, too profound, simply too good for the Hollywood peanut gallery. The impact of BBM has been absolutely ""historical"" in scope. Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history. This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented international acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely have we seen a film have such an impact on society, in the media, and with the general public, even on those who haven't seen it or did not have the courage to see it. In no way can Crash measure up to any of this.

Crash does have its merits but, by fetching the Best Picture Oscar through a desperate and very costly campaign, it showed that with money, you can make people believe anything. It also proved how irrelevant, unimportant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.",1151366400,17,5650,4.907853403141361
2358834,1,B000A3XY5A,"Heavy handed, lacking nuance, acting or story, reminded me of the stuff I saw on television in the PRC where there was almost nothing that was not meant to ""educate society"" or reinforce the agenda of that week's mandated ""political study"".  While it was somewhat amusing (not very, I had to reach very hard) to see human beings living up to and fulfilling their stereotypes, I was frightened by the fact that this film won best picture at the Academy Awards.  It was clear to me that none of the people who made this film, or perhaps any of the people acting in this film, had ever lived in a neighborhood, a truly mixed neighborhood.  In such neighborhoods there might be some of the abrasion that comes from the rubbing of cultures against each other there is also a sense of identity, of sharing fate, of struggling together for a better life.  Race is not that important in a neighborhood like City Heights (East San Diego) where I (a white woman!) lived alone for 17 years. In such a world one quickly learns that racism is a luxury no one can afford.",1151366400,21,1057,4.489583333333333

It felt like someone's thesis on race relations in the United States. In an attempt to create the most unlikely of situations to prove that race is not as black and white as it may seem, the writer tried to create scenes that were too artificial and too distilled to be of substance. The ensemble cast was a talented bunch, but poorly used. The performances in general may be the only redeeming thing about a movie that seems like it was written by a college freshman trying to impress his film professor.",1151280000,19,647,4.491525423728813
2358837,1,B000A3XY5A,"I just finished watching this film.  I find that it takes a very simplistic and childlike view of race relations. It's extremely melodramatic in all of the wrong ways. It started out as intriguing with the development of plot, but the resolutions were weak and tepid. This has a very TV-movie quality to it, and I am SHOCKED that this movie won the best movie of the year. The only thing I can think of is that the liberal Hollywood elite wants Americans to think that there is still a tremendous amount of civil strive between races. This hostility is what fuels the Dem base. There is of course still racism in this country, but there is no way it is this ubiquitous, and this movie constantly veers towards parody unintentionally with its heavy handed ""everyone's a little bit racist"" cries.",1151107200,47,794,4.631205673758865
2358838,4,B000A3XY5A,"As the film opens, we meet the two men coming out of the restaurant. Their discussion is interesting and a bit funny, but a little theatrical. Soon, we meet another couple. Then these two couples interact. Quickly, we meet a third person. Then they interact with one of the previous people and we follow the new person to their home and learn a little about their family life. Then we meet a fourth, and quickly, they interact with a fifth, and so on. This sort of `round robin' method of story telling may sound a little confusing, but I was never lost and I doubt you will be either. The key is that each character is quickly established as an interesting though maybe disgusting, maybe normal, maybe conflicted person right away. Each person is fused into our subconscious with a few words or actions.

As the film switches back and forth, Haggis uses a number of techniques to keep the action fluid. For instance, we might follow the detective during a visit to his mother's house. As he leaves, he opens a door and the camera pans across the open door to follow the white District Attorney as he enters a meeting. Or, a character looks out a window and the camera pans across the window to reveal another character looking through their window. As the camera settles on them, the story then centers on this character. This technique creates a fluidity that keeps things moving. It also thrusts us into the middle of the action, causing our minds to keep working as we follow the stories, the characters, and the actions. Your eyes will be riveted to the screen the whole time.

Much of the beauty of the screenplay and directing is that each character is quickly established and becomes memorable. One character is introduced with a monologue revealing their deep-seated racism. It is a memorable scene. In the hands of most filmmakers, this would be the extent of exploration for this character. In the hands of Haggis, we then learn the more subtle aspects of this same character. Later, more examples of the character's racism. Then more about the same person's life. This leads to a very complete portrait of this person. Imagine the same level of detail applied to the other ten or eleven characters and you begin to get a feeling of the complexity of ""Crash"".

It would be difficult to classify any of the actors as the ""star"" of the film. It is a true ensemble piece. Each of the very good actors is playing a small role, but the roles are integral to the overall fabric of the story. Each actor is memorable. Don Cheadle, apparently the first person approached, read the screenplay and immediately signed on. He also helped to get the other actors involved in the project. His performance is, as always, great. Cheadle plays Graham, the black detective He is a tough guy, but what lies beneath the toughness? What caused him to have such a bleak outlook? During the course of the film, we learn these things, adding dimension to his character. Jennifer Esposito plays his partner, Ria. Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser play a married couple, each of whom has to deal with issues of racism, in different, believable ways. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play an affluent married couple. He is a successful television director who doesn't at first realize what he is dealing with when he and his wife have an encounter with two cops. This encounter is especially harrowing and hard to watch. It is also done in a completely believable manner, which makes it all the more disturbing. Those cops are played by Matt Dillon (in another great performance) and Ryan Phillippe. Michael Pena is particularly memorable as the Latino father. He is not well-known. Yet. Another couple of roles like this and he will break out of character actor roles. Ludacris and Larenz Tate play the two men who discuss their service at the restaurant in Westwood. Their performances are perhaps the most theatrical, and least believable, but they still work. They frequently have long conversations similar to the ""Quarter Pounder in France"" dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"". There are many more equally memorable characters, but these are the most recognizable names.

If it seems like I am holding back some information, I am. I don't want to reveal how these characters interact, completely, because that is part of the power of the film. As the stories progress, and we meet the characters, they keep changing, or encountering unexpected incidents. Part of the film's impact is the surprise we experience as these people's lives change throughout. Also, it is interesting to watch the sort of ""Round Robin"" style of storytelling I mentioned before.

""Crash"" takes place over 36 hours in Los Angeles. The scenes set during the day are bright, a bit overexposed and grainy from bright sun. Some of the transitions are also caused by bright flashes of sun. Transitioning to night, there is little difference, because Los Angeles is so inundated with light. When the characters move to less populated areas, the film becomes darker, and grainier, due to the lack of light. This visual style fits the setting. It is more than a little refreshing to find a filmmaker who creates a film that has a lot of artistic flourish, but the flourishes only enhance the story. Too often filmmakers feel it necessary to show all of the tricks they can do, whether it serves the story or not. Haggis does show off some tricks, but they don't feel intrusive.",1151020800,16,5468,4.788135593220339

Spike Lee's movie was at least creative, somewhat groundbreaking and touched a raw nerve in society.  You have to strike when the iron is hot.  I live in L.A, and I can honestly say there is very little ""racial tension"" around here.  There are exceptions to every rule and life will never be perfect, but if you are on the REAL streets and deal with REAL people everyday, the race thing is beyond passe and stale.

2358849,5,B000A3XY5A,"No wonder Crash won the 2005 Best Picture Oscar. Paul Haggis, in his directing debut, gives us a story the explores the themes of race and violence in Los Angeles, but I think the story could be easily translated to any city peopled by a mix of ethnic citizens. The name comes from the idea that different people leading different lives can collide, and that in some cases, these collisions represent the only times people truly connect in our society, an environment where people design their lives to minimize contact with others.

The cast reads like a attendance list of Hollywood glitterati: Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillipe, Brendan Fraser. Many of the scenes are little acting studies in tone, gesture, and facial expression. All characters have very different roles: Dillon and Phillipe are cops with different values, Cheadle is a detective, Fraser is the D.A., Bullock is his wife, and Terrence Howard is a television producer. Other key figures include a Mexican locksmith, two African-American car thieves, and a Persian couple and their daughter.

I really loved how the film was engaging, riveting, but that it explored a topic that really mattered. Crash takes a hard look at some thorny issues in our society, things that people don't tend to talk about without becoming emotional or further inflaming the situation. I also liked that the film didn't pretend to have all the answers. Instead, it showed the complexity of the problem and provided much food for thought. It illustrated how those with the best intentions sometimes find themselves the architects of the injustices they despise in society, and how those who are up to no good sometimes end up accomplishing quite alot of it. The film also spoke to me regarding self-definition: how we define ourselves, how we let others define us, what we think makes us who we are, what we think betrays our identities.

Paul Haggis' previous credits include the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby, another film that I loved that dealt with unpopular social issues. Haggis is definitely proving himself as someone who says things that we are all thinking, but afraid to verbalize. I can't wait for his next film.",1149552000,7,2216,5.0

That said, I did try to keep an open mind when watching Crash, and it just didn't work for me.

A number of things turned me off. First, I thought that the dialogue was unrealistic and contrived. In the special features the writers claimed that they were trying to present situations and interactions between people that would make the viewers uncomfortable and force them to confront their own prejudices. It did make me uncomfortable, not so much due to the realism of the situations portrayed in the movie, but simply because of the awkwardness of the dialogue. In this movie, racism is not a subtle sentiment that lurks beneath the surface. Instead, racism is right there, just waiting to be acted upon in response to the slightest provocation.

The first part of the movie basically consists of people being set off by the slightest misunderstandings and resorting to ridiculous racial slurs. A white gun store owner unleashes a tirade of racial invective against a Persian man who takes too long to decide what type of gun he wants. There is a fender bender between a Chinese woman and a Latino woman, who immediately engage in a war of racial slurs before they even have time to assess the damage. This same Chinese woman later curses at a nurse because she asks if the woman can speak English after she barges into the hospital in search of her husband shouting his name at the top of her lungs. There were so many misunderstandings and unfortunate events that could have been avoided if people would just speak in calm voices and resist the temptation to yell.

Maybe this was the point that the movie was trying to make, that people need to chill out and evaluate their own prejudices before acting. And the unfortunate events that occurred were supposed to allow the characters to reflect on these prejudices and ultimately redeem themselves. However, the redemption that the characters did experience seemed artificial to me. What are we supposed to make of the scene where Matt Dillon's racist cop character saves the life of a black woman whom he had earlier molested? Has he been redeemed by this experience? Why? Surely in his 10-year cop as an LA cop he has had other opportunities to help African Americans in similarly extreme circumstances. If so, are we supposed to believe that only an event so extreme as saving another person's life offers the opportunity for introspection? What lesson has the Persian store owner learned after he almost commits a horrific crime?  After the incident, he has a tearful conversation with his daughter in which he spouts some babble about a guardian angel, but has he learned to stop flying off the handle every time he is provoked? I was similarly unconvinced by Sandra Bullock's character's sudden conversion to a decent person after her Latino maid cares for her after an injury. In none of these instances is it really clear what these characters have learned. Overall, I just didn't feel as if these movie brought any sort of fresh new perspective to the difficult issue of race. If anything, the film makes me want to rewatch Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, which offers a much more intense and realistic portrait of racial relations.",1149465600,50,3421,4.793220338983051
2358852,5,B000A3XY5A,"As terrible as the following statement sounds, racism it's usually the source of awful conflicts, hatred and prejudices. In the city of Los Angeles, this thesis seems to be characteristically true. At least, that's how the 2006 Oscar's winning movie Crash portrays it, written and directed by Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby).

Exhibiting diverse segments in the lives of a diverse group of characters along 48 hours, Crash confronts the audience with realistic and intense controversial topics. Latinos, arabs, whites, blacks, koreans, iranians, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless will define their relationships and their behavior through the racism planted in their brains.

The collisions to which the movie's title refers are mostly emotional, and through these crashes we end up understanding each one of the characters, their lives and reasons to distrust each other. The wonderful thing about Crash is that we cannot predict any of the decisions these characters will take, because they will be closely linked with the unexpected turns that destiny takes.

The final result is a series of parables in which the characters learn from their mistakes and their biased behaviors. The lessons are not subtle, but hard and cruel, because we are all prejudiced by nature, and for being like that, we usually pay a very high price.

The most important thing is to discover that hope is not completely lost; and in Crash's case, the characters learn something positive about themselves. And it's in that discovery where lies the wonderful possibility to decide to live a more fair and optimistic life. That's a lesson to never forget.",1149379200,2,1653,5.156716417910448

After many people recommended that I see this film, I finally broke down and rented it.  I can honestly say that it in no way moved me or affected my outlook on life like so many people said it would.  It left me asking why this film is so hyped and lauded.

The theme of the story is constantly rammed down your throat and played out by characters who are complete and extreme stereo-types of their races.  Matt Dillon and Sandra Bullock's characters are laughingly predictable, as are Ludacris and Larenz Tate.  The only thing I found touching about the film was the relationship of the locksmith and his daughter, which took all of 10 minutes of the movie.  The other characters were so unredeming and abrasive that I didn't care what happened to them.

The end of the story brings hardly any change in the characters, and those that do are not based in reality.  For those who have seen it, look to Sandra Bullock's character as reference.  Keep in mind, this is suppose to be a day in the life of these people.

So what do you take away from this film?  'That we are all racists.'  How profound.

If you want to see a good film about racism with well thought-out characters that you actually feel for, rent 'American History X'.  There is redemeption and emotion 10 times over what you find in 'Crash'.",1148601600,31,1540,4.350877192982456

A lot happened in the movie that it really didn't allow the viewer's mind to drift even for a moment otherwise you would miss something.  It is also a very American story.

2358869,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a film that makes you ask a lot of questions about yourself and your racist attitudes. It is just like a ""crash"" in many ways, difficult to watch and sometimes uncomfortable.

It's a bit like Short Cuts with lots of different character, and so the plot is difficult to describe but I'll give it a go.

This film is set in the glamourous and sometimes violent streets of LA, where everyone lives with a sense of suspicion about their fellow man (or woman). A wealthy white District Attourney is on the eve of a big election. He and his wife are car jacked by two black men who then go on the run. Meanwhile, a wealthy black couple are stopped by white police who harass them. The District Attourney hires a Mexican locksmith to change his locks, but his wife is suspicious of his gang tattoos. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else in this film, whether they're black, white, Chinese or Mexican. As events unfold, there are many twists and turns and you realise the bad guys aren't always bad, and the good guys aren't always good, a reminder that you can't judge a book by its cover. The message is clear - that everyone can be racist when it comes to it.

There are powerful performances from Don Cheadle and Sandra Bullock as the hysterical DA's wife, as well as Matt Dillon as a racist cop.

This is a good film to watch on DVD with a good bottle of wine and a friend. It really got us thinking well into the night. We spent a long time discussing it, about the prejudices we have had without realising them.

This was a very powerful film that did not answer questions, only asked them of us. As Michael Jackson said, you've got to start with the man in the mirror if you want to make that change.",1147219200,7,1712,4.35423197492163
2358870,5,B000A3XY5A,"Wow.  Been a long time since I saw a movie so willing to toss human nature so nakedly under a microscope like ""Crash"" does.  Ignoring some of the more prominent human shortcomings like greed, vanity, or envy, ""Crash"" zeroes in on the one trait that seems to make people squirm uncomfortably in a way similar to imagining your own parents having wild sex... you... just... don't... want... to... talk about it.  And that oft-denied, unnerving aspect of human nature is racial prejudice.

In what starts out as seemingly just another cop story in Los Angeles, we're presented an assorted list of characters of varying race and background, whose story lines are loosely interlaced and whose racial preconceptions help them filter and try to come to grips with (rather ineffectively in some cases) the collisions of their lives in random happenstance.

""Crash"" jumps right in with both feet showing us examples of bitter blatant racial characterizations from multiple racial groups towards multiple other racial groups.  We see two young black men, bickering back and forth about whether they have or haven't been victims of stereotyping, only to have them steal an expensive car at gun point in a predominantly white part of town.  A heavily accented Asian woman threatens to call immigration on a fluently-English-speaking Latino woman.  A black man references the ""Mexican woman"" he's just been sleeping with whose parents are actually from Puerto Rico and another Central American country (not Mexico).  An Iranian immigrant's store is vandalized with spray-painted slurs about him being Arab (hopefully most of you reading this realize Persians/Iranians aren't Arabic).  And there are plenty more uneasy depictions of people unfortunately acting prejudiced, biased, hypocritical or just plain ignorant.  Though some of examples come across a bit preachy at times, the impact of the message still carries weight.

What's the point to it all?  I'd have to say the main idea to this movie is to show that racial prejudice shows no racial prejudice.  Even the most racially stereotyped and demeaned people can turn around and racially stereotype and demean other people.  And seeing it that way, maybe the real message in the movie is that we all really are more alike that we'd like to admit.  To different degrees, we ALL judge people by the way they dress, look, act, speak, or walk...for good or ill...and in that way, we're really not so different.

Sounds a little heavy, eh?  Well, it is, but this movie and its message are delivered in a way that is deceptively subtle.  The blows are obvious, but the impact doesn't leave you black and blue, mostly just reflective.  The glass is half full AND half empty in this movie...there's loss AND redemption...yin AND yang...

Very good flick, makes you think...not perfect, but damn good.  I'd say 4.5 stars for the delivery, and 6 stars for having the huevos to tackle the topic so bluntly.  Way worth watching, and the soundtrack is quite nice also.  Check it out...",1146960000,9,3016,5.022132796780684
2358871,2,B000A3XY5A,"A film stitched together with very thick twine. This is how I imagine making of ""Crash"": 10 or so sitcom screenwriters are summoned and sat down at a table for 5 hours. Snacks are provided. The first task is: ""write down your most recent experience related to race relations in the USA."" Something you have heard yourself, heard a friend talk about, heard on TV. Two hours later the writers are given a second task: ""write down the  thickest racial and immigrant stereotype that comes to your mind."" Two more hours later (one hour goes for lingering and bathroom breaks) the pages are taken from the writers and put in a food processor. Well, an equivalent of it, some computer program that arranges the pages in random order. The screenwriters go on a lunch break. After the break the facilitator gives them a Power Point presentation of the written material and says ""please notice the main themes. Come up with 5 to 6 sub-plots and 8 to 10 characters that emerge from this material."" An hour later, and after a short bathroom break, the movie script is ready.
No, I'm not kidding. This is how the movie MUST have been made. The rhythm of the film is like of a sitcom, only except for bursting with laughter, the audience would gasp. Characters that are so diverse should be interesting, but they come out cartoonish. The process of shooting the movie must also have been speedy and simplistic. Sometimes the actors talk like they are reading the script from a conveniently positioned screen. Considering the sloppiness of Crash, I'm surprised that the audience couldn't (I couldn't) catch an accidental glimpse of such a screen, with the dialogue scrolling, the actors glancing at it, thinking about what they are going to do in the evening, not even paying attention to the artificial dialogue that comes out of their mouths....
There's the other side of the story: I'm very glad to see a popular movie about race relations, discrimination, prejudice, connections, etc etc in the USA. I'm an immigrant in the USA myself and, even with my white skin, lots of BS is constantly flying my way in many different ways. When I try to point this out, most people act like they have not clue and they would rather change the subject. Prejudice and discrimination need to be talked about, written about, made movies about - with artistic grace and passion, with depth, with heart, with thoughtfulness... ""Crash"" doesn't have any of that. I'm so glad the movie didn't include an Eastern European immigrant... I'm getting a cramp when I think what would be a ""Crash"" version of, let's say, a Russian?
My only explanation for the Oscar is that the Academy decided not to look at the artistic merit but at the urgency and importance of the issues Crash is trying to (clumsily) address.
I'm waiting for another movie. I'm waiting for many movies about race and diversity that will not just hit me with thick stereotypes, dazzle me with quick twists of the plot, startle me by its number of characters and the speed of the good guy turning bad guy turning good guy, but would shake my heart, make me wonder and feel and give me inspiration. I'm waiting for Awards for movies made by minority members, and not just about them (us). I'm waiting for a great movie on the greatest subject of this century: where are we all now in this melting world?

2358875,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is one of the greatest films ever made. Quite an accusation to make as the opening sentence of a review you say? Well this time you CAN believe the hype. For once, I honestly agree with the Academy's choice for Crash as the picture of the year. Crash is an emotionally riveting expose' from beginning to end. A true chronicle of the ways race and discrimination shapes our lives. With displays of breath taking courage and emotional turmoil, Crash delivers on every aspect a film should deliver on. Leaving the viewer with a changed heart and a thought filled mind.

Crash follows it's incredible cast through a 36 hour period in which all of the characters are faced with issues of racial hate and stereotypes. I know...It sounds like some kind of after school TV special. But the pure emotional carnage and the expertly written and acted script pull this film into the realm of having historical significance. Coming in at just under two hours in length, Crash displays an amazing amount of meaning into a considerably short period of time.

The acting is pure perfection. Paul Haggis directs with such a sheer intensity that leaves you struck and truly caring for each and every character and gives you a little spot for yourself in the movie. What I mean by this is that you do not simply believe that you are watching a scripted film, but that you are a witness to all of these events as they are occurring. You don't just relate yourself to one of the characters, but all of them, because all of them hold a piece to the puzzle of humanity.

I love the dynamics of the film as well. The film starts with all of the characters having a certain hypocritical superiority complex. While they are all quick to defend their own race for people that are prejudice to them, they are even more quick to discriminate against someone else. But what really set the greatness of the movie into my mind, were the changes the characters go through within the story. They all realize that underneath all of our differences are undiscovered truths and a bond that all human species are inherited with. The ending also leaves the audience conflicted. Both heart-breaking and joyful emotions are drawn from the end. Which left me feeling a exotic mix of emotions that I have not used in a long time.

Every actor in this film is a supporting actor. There is no real starring role. Though, that is one of the things I love about the film. There may not be a starring role, but the starring role is divided into all of the supporting roles, creating a monster of acting perfection. Paul Haggis really has made a point though. If everything is made equal, things are a lot better. Could their be a hidden meaning even in the amount of screen time each actor got?

Hands down this was the film of the year. Maybe even one of the best movies of all-time. It left me speechless and emotional. Crash displays true substance and teaches everyone a lesson that even the most radical of racial activist can not deny. When life is boiled down to it's one true meaning, when color and demographics are thrown out the window, and religious differences are discarded of, we all only have one thing. And that is life its self. The meaning of life is life itself...huh, what a concept. If only we lived in utopia, where all are nights were slept soundly and all are differences were forgotten. Then maybe we really all could start to live.

There are many reasons for this including more opportunities to make lower budget yet intense movies and a growing elite attitude in Hollywood (not that its new).  To me, this was by far the best movie of those nominated for best movie.

It seems that both those on the left and right have issues with the politics of the movie, so that enforces my belief that the movie attacks racism in a fair way.  Many of the characters are based on stereotypes.  But we do encounter such stereotypes in real life.  It also gives us complete well rounded characters that we can understand even if we don't live in their world.

Nothing gets resolved in this movie.  With maybe the exception of one character (the locksmith) all are flawed.  The movie does little if any preaching and really just entertains while portraying stories that make us examine our beliefs.  Some consider it a racist movie but I think it just tries to entertain rather than make a political point.  Thats why it is such a good movie.

""Crash""has to be one of the most overrated movies in recent memory, which is compounded by its Oscars.  Was it really that bad a year for movies?  ""Crash,""with its reliance on coincidence and wooden speeches on things related to race is both heavy handed and annoying.  You find yourself asking yourself again and again: do people really talk like this?  The use of coincidence is also over-the-top.  I'm okay with coincidence, but it has to be done with a light touch.  Movies such as ""Magnolia,"" or any number of Robert Altman efforts (not to mention Shakespeare), show just how to do this.  Director Haggis however has a blind eye to match his tin ear.  At one point you have racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) saving a woman he had recently felt up in an earlier traffic stop scene.  OK.  This is soon followed by Dillon's ex-partner confronting the husband of the felt up woman in a potential car-jacking incident.  Come on!  And that's just a small slice of the interconnectedness of ""Crash."" It's a small and racist world indeed.  Oh, and we need to get over it and see the real common humanity that we all share.  All to the accompanyment of a gloomy and swelling musical score - the kind that shows up in movies like ""The Killing Fields"" or ""Platoon."" There are a some good effective scenes in ""Crash,""that indeed convey the ugliness of racism.  In particular the traffic stop of a married couple (see above), which is also done without speeches.  Haggis for once lets the action take over.  It's ugly - and True.  You feel like taking a shower after the humiliation this couple suffers at the hands of Dillon's Officer Ryan.  Also effective is Dillon's saving of the same women a bit later.  The ""common humanity we share"" thing that Haggis is hitting us over the head with, bears fruit as Dillon frantically tries to free the woman from the flames (metaphor alert) that are streaking towards both of them.

So bigotry cuts both ways - we get it.  But having seen each of their softer sides, we can't simply dismiss any of them as idiots - we get that too.

Then the coincidences take over.  Of all the cops who could have climbed into that burning car to save Thandie Newton's character, the one who does it just happens to be the slime who felt her up and bullied her husband.  The ""charming"" carjacker - the less malevolent of the duo - just happens to be the wayward sibling of Don Cheadle's character.

""See?"" the movie says, ""Racist jerks can be heroes too!  So lighten up  - maybe you do have to put up with a regular abuse of power by law enforcement but there's always the chance they could save your life.  So it all evens out!

""The guy who stole your SUV just might like the same religious artifacts as you!""  Its a slick, facile suggestion that humans - Americans in particular - can just take issues of race and racism and simply put them someplace else when they become inconvenient.  Or that the lasting effects of a history of racism can not only be quantified but then outweighed by the underlying platitude suggested by the movie:  we're all good and we're all bad, so let's just call it even.

I found all these messages to be self-serving, heavy-handed and untrue to the reality of living in this country.  I'm also no longer sure that my review title is true.  But I'll be watching...",1146182400,20,1876,4.44574780058651

Then again, it doesn't surprise me that it won the Oscar for Best Picture.  When you film a movie in L.A., cast one third of Hollywood in it, and weave a contrived story of race relations while employing a tired six-degrees-of-separation theme a la ""Magnolia,"" it shouldn't be surprising that so many viewers and critics overpraise it.  The screenplay is riddled with implausibilities and unrealistic dialogue, which threatens even the most solid performances.  I dig Ludacris, both the rapper and the actor (check him out in ""Hustle and Flow"" if you really want to see him act), but his preaching and sermonizing in this film grew shrill real fast.  Equally annoying was Sandra Bullock, going into overdrive as the stereotypically uptight rich white woman.  Faring much better were Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe, and, best of all, Matt Dillon, who richly deserved his Oscar nomination.  But while these actors do THEIR job, the filmmakers (director Paul haggis in particular) fail to do theirs.  ""Crash"" has good intentions, good performances and a few solid moments, but its execution is badly lacking.  Come to think of it, Spike Lee filmed a much more honest and compelling commentary on race relations back in 1989.  That film is called ""Do the Right Thing.""",1146096000,19,1412,5.047413793103448

2358884,3,B000A3XY5A,"Now don't get me wrong; Crash is decent, and completely watchable.  Best Picture material?  Uh, no.

Look, I think it's fine and even occasionally necessary to remind people that racism exists and that, despite conscious or unconscious tendencies toward racism, people are more complicated than we think at first glance.  Yes, sometimes there's a reason (although not an excuse) for racism.

And having said all that, I still don't think Crash is anything close to a great movie.  It whacks you over the head again and again with its message that a) all races are okay, and b) even racists are people, too.  It accomplishes this message by taking a minimally simplistic view of racism--racists are baaaaad people--and complicating it, albeit as minimally as possible, by giving all the racists one redeeming quality.

Yes, Matt Dillon's character is racist... but he loves his father!  Yes, Sandra Bullock's character thinks all people of color are lazy... but she actually cares about her Latina housekeeper!  Yes, Don Cheadle's character is insensitive toward his girlfriend/partner (he calls her white, but she's not; he calls her Mexican, but she's not that either)... but he loves his mother!

And so on.  It's something we've all come across in our everyday experience and thought about in much more nuanced terms than this film cares to do.  If you have a sixth-grader, then perhaps this film is for him.

Now, let me repeat: this film is decent, and watchable.  Perhaps I'd be less disappointed if Academy voters hadn't, in a colossally dumb move, annointed Crash as the best picture of the year.  It isn't, not by a long shot.  But it's still enjoyable: well-directed, DEFINITELY well-acted, and the soundtrack is excellent.  I just think that our national discourse on racism (and yes, movies are appropriate vehicles for this discourse) ought to move beyond such simplistic views.",1146009600,23,1891,5.064724919093851
2358885,2,B000A3XY5A,"Like a bad student film with big-name stars in its cast, Paul Haggis' puerile and self-important ""Crash"" is a masterpiece for the easily impressed.  Filled with bathos and bombast, and more implausible coincidences than an 800-page novel by Charles Dickens (and no offense meant to Mr. Dickens), ""Crash"" plays less like a movie and more like some underachiever's dissertation for a Sociology course entitled Racism 101.  (Racist white cop fondles black woman in front of her husband at routine traffic stop...pause projector...discuss what this scene shows about racism in our society...resume film...same racist white cop pulls same black woman to safety from burning wreckage...pause projector...discuss what this scene says about the possibility of redemption for every individual...etc.).  Astonishingly, this piece of mealy-mouthed claptrap won the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 2005.

Cribbing its interlocking, multi-character format from ""Short Cuts,"" ""Grand Canyon,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""13 Conversations About One Thing"" and a whole host of other similar but far superior films, Haggis' work purports to tell us that everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - living in Los Angeles is a thoroughgoing racist and bigot and, even more amazingly, spends twenty-four hours a day giving voice to their prejudice.  Forget about political correctness; these people talk about race, race and nothing but race for nigh unto two hours in ways that show that Haggis is completely tone deaf when it comes to how people in the real world actually speak.  This is a movie devoid of a single plausible moment (you know that verisimilitude is not high on this film's agenda when it starts snowing in Los Angeles!); it's a movie in which characters act completely without reason or motivation and in which every event that happens, no matter how idiotic or ridiculous, does so in the service of the message.  On the level of dramaturgy alone, ""Crash"" is an unmitigated disaster and a blueprint for how not to make a movie.

Unfortunately, as ""Crash"" itself begins to crash and burn, an awful lot of fine people wind up getting trapped inside the wreckage.  A largely talented cast is wasted on an assortment of poorly written, shallow characters, and Haggis has no idea of how to create either drama or tension in any of the scenes he shows us.  The moody score by Mark Isham does its best to make it all seem powerful and important, but the sheer incompetence of the writing and directing rob the film of both those qualities.  Indeed, rarely has a movie been as full of itself as ""Crash"" is, and rarely has a movie explored such a serious and important subject in as pretentious and superficial a manner.  Perhaps the most insulting aspect of the film is how easily it bestows redemption on even its most wretched characters, as if all of life's problems could be so easily wrapped up in time for the closing credits.  As others before me have pointed out, this is indeed a ""feel good"" movie about racism, the very last thing a movie about racism should ever be.

If you can buy a film in which an assortment of whiney, unappealing characters hurl racial invectives at one another for an hour and a half, then turn around and throw themselves into each others' arms in time for the tear-stained finale, then ""Crash"" may be the movie for you.  But if you find yourself laughing rather than weeping through the course of the story, don't say you hadn't been warned beforehand.

2358886,1,B000A3XY5A,"I guess the best thing that can be said about this film is that the Key Grip did some really extraordinary work. The Gaffers were spot on as well.  The script was painfully strident and insultingly pretentious, however. In general, ""tedious"" is best used to describe the story line.

Yet another pampered Southern California writer sat in a mansion with a view and typed out a script that is blatant in its attempt to cast Los Angeles in the worst light possible. This is possibly the most ridiculously contrived movie to come out of the plastic metropolis in a decade. If you want to have the pain of the holocaust or the ill treatment of the Jews regurgitated for re-inspection yet again, stick with Spielberg. If you need to have someone lecture you about the evil of Vietnam,  stick with Stone. However, if you are ready for the shrill grating of someone's politically-correct guilt being splashed up on the screen in fragmented bursts... then Haggis is probably for you.

The film concept is not only recycled, it is basically Magnolia with the distorted misconceptions of the politically correct Southern California film industry pounded into us with the loving tenderness of an extremist agitator with good diction and perfect elocution.

Unfortunately the masses have tripped over themselves to support this movie because of the incestuous interest generated by the industry from which it came. Critics raved because they followed the gushing lead of the film industry, therefore the general public sheepishly follows along and recites the mantra of praise provided by others ""who know better.""

I have opted to step out of the queue of lemmings and come to my own conclusion... and my own conclusion is that this is a heavy handed, pedestrian, and unworthy of the awards.

2358887,5,B000A3XY5A,"One of those films that makes you want to watch it all over again right away. The way this intelligent gem works is that it makes you ultimately not want anything bad to happen to any of these people. The ""heroes and villains"" we encounter are brilliantly taken beyond type and become real enough for us genuinely to care - how much better is that than the soft-soap preachifying we get out of so many other ""issue"" pieces that strap their hearts onto their sleeves (and, all too often, the chips onto their shoulders) from the outset! ""Crash"" goes for the brain. It bonds you with an intriguing cross-section of recognisable individuals, challenging expectations all the time.

It's no less engaging and entertaining for all that, pulling off several mind-changes with little in the way of obvious moral convolution but much invested in character study and telling, accumulating, intersecting incidents. Plus it contains a couple of the most dry-mouthed, breath-catching suspense set-pieces you're likely to experience. The musical score matches this effective subversion by giving you moving, haunting themes in action-moments where more obvious players would lump in the techno-beats. Wit sparks in the dialogue where others would pile on the profanity and tough-talk. There's an elegance to the whole piece that makes what goes on cherishable rather than disposable.

All the characters whose lives collide here are divided - by class, gender, age and, of course, race (this last element being the paradoxical link, other than narrative, that ""unites"" the cast in being the focus for their various alienations). They are also variously unappealing or likeable in their ""types"" and behaviours. So just to shake this lot together in a series of overlapping incidents would have been engaging enough, given the acting abilities of all concerned and the terrific dialogue they're given.

As I said, though, the film's moral triumph is to take our sympathies and allegiances and work on them until we realise that the ""value"" of everyone here is that they deserve to stay in the world. We're ultimately surprised by the value and humanity to which everyone here is seen to aspire in their way. The film is exciting, harrowing and funny enough to hit all the right buttons in terms of good, popular viewing; but the affirmative difference it finally makes is well worth celebrating.

In fact, of all the characters to appear on the screen, only two (the Persian daughter who works the late shift at the LA County coroner's office and the DA's housekeeper) aren't shown to be explicitly racist. It's the kind of thing that seems deeply profound in high school or college, but the plot simply isn't as sophisticated as it should have been.

Having said that, the movie's still worth seeing. There are, to a person, great performances in the film (including the eerie sight of Tony Danza convincingly coming off as a racist Hollywood television producer) and some very sharp dialogue, a lot of it performed by Ludacris (including a humorous attack by him on hip-hop music).

Watching this movie at the cinema I was incredibly moved.  It is touching and requires thought.  My best friends sat on the other side of the theater and left.  To each his own.  When I watch a movie I want to be entertained, learn, and/or emotionally be moved.  This movie does all three.

You learn about yourself and society as the most racist commit the kindest acts and vice versa.  Particularly, there are two scenes in this that will literally bring you to tears or at a minimum emotionally destroy you.

But is it entertaining?  That appears to be where there is conflict.  For me, it was immensely entertaining.  For my friends, boring and more importantly, offensive.  I like to be challenged.  I like to view issues from a different perspective.  This movie does all that.  If you are that type person, order it immediately.

Now as to the Director's Cut, there is minimal change to the movie.  I rarely buy DVDs and when I do it is for the Director to explain his inspiration.  For me, listening to Paul describe how he wrote the movie and where specific scenes were generated in his own life brought this movie into a higher realm of understanding and heightened my enjoyment and understanding.

I believe everyone should see this movie just to see how they will react.  Much as I believe everyone should see Brokeback for the same reason.

2358890,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash (Paul Haggis, 2005)

If this was the best English-language film of 2005, then 2005 was one of the worst years for movies in recent memory.

It's not that Crash is a bad film; rather like its fellow Best Picture nominee Brokeback Mountain, Crash is a decent film with hints of greatness that are never realized. The full effect of the film is a school of fantastic performances awash in a sea of mediocrity in direction, pace, and especially writing.

Haggis, who should be best remembered as the creator of TV's Walker, Texas Ranger, takes an ensemble cast through a day of racism. Yes, folks, that's the entire premise of the film; various things happen, but there's no real defining moment. Some characters die, and some characters come to realize that their racism is wrong, both of which generally happen with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the temple; Haggis has a message, folks, and he wants to make sure you get it. As always, when the message supersedes the medium, the result is a mediocre mess.

It is, however, a mediocre mess that includes some fantastic performances. Larenz Tate, one of Hollywood's great underrated, turns in his best performance here since The Inkwell a decade before. Tate is never less than excellent, and here he's brilliant. Ludacris, as Tate's partner in crime, shows a flair for the dramatic as well. Brendan Fraser, who's spent the years since Gods and Monsters acting in fluff, shows that he is, in fact, still capable of sinking his teeth into a dramatic role. Sandra Bullock, playing Fraser's wife, is on the other hand completely wasted, nothing more than a cardboard cutout there to advance a viewpoint. Other excellent actors have what seem as if they could be powerful roles, but don't get nearly enough screen time to develop them-- Don Cheadle and Keith David are the two prime examples. Other wonderful actors are stuck with Bullock-like roles, most notably William Fichtner.

When I started writing this review, I didn't know that Paul Haggis was the creator of Walker, Texas Ranger; now, however, it seems like I should have known all along. ** ?",1145577600,17,2111,4.836565096952908

Both intentional and unintentional.

You truly walk in the shoes of every character and I found it difficult to defend one character without defending the other who was in direct opposition. It exposes our own prejudices, however subtle, and it magnifies our need for growth in diversity.

While we generally shun the very thought of being sterotyped, we're faced with raw honesty in its truest form. Steroetypes don't come about by accident and that's the hardest pill to swallow.

What I think this film captures best is the isolation of modern life that we all experience from time to time (or more regularly for others).  I think the people in LA, in general, experience more isolation in their daily lives than in other places in the country (not that we don't experience it in New York City as well - it's just that in NYC, it's in a different form - mostly by choice).  The first time I ever went to LA, I was shocked that at 10 p.m. on a Friday night, the streets were virtually empty, that you absolutely needed a car to get anywhere, that there wasn't much interaction amongst people just walking around on the street in the downtown area.  It was very different to me than what I was used to (and I'm guessing that people from out of New York City might have some opinions about New York too).

Though there is a decent amount of individual redemption in the film, something that struck me (that I haven't seen any other recent reviewer mention) is that the words ""I'm sorry"" are spoken only three times of the course of the entire film.  Officer Ryan says it twice (once to the HMO lady - actually he says he apologizes, not technically ""I'm sorry"" in that instance - because he needs something from her and once for saying the f-word while trying to pull Thandie Newton's character out of the burning SUV).  The only other time is when Thandie Newton's character says it to her husband for her reaction to his behavior (or lack of) while they are being harassed and molested by Officer Ryan.  From a writing standpoint, I thought that it was really insightful and smart to show redemption in ways that don't require words like ""I'm sorry.""  Though many people would choose the burning car scene as the most powerful and emotionally redemptive scene, for me, there are two other scenes that recognize redemption in a more intimate, less public format (because I think that true redemption comes from within).  In one scene, Sandra Bullock's character tells her maid she's the best friend she has.  And in another, Officer Ryan takes care of his very ill father (the scene where he kisses his father on the head).

As for the burning SUV scene, I was impressed mostly by the how the scene looked - how realistic the sun setting in the west looked in the background and its affect on the viewer.  For me, the sunset reflecting off of the dusty windshield reminded me of early morning driving east and the sun hitting the glass a certain way and no matter what you do - visor, sunglasses - you can't fight it.  There's this hazy blur that takes over at sunrise and sunset and that, combined with the orange of the flames and the subtly sun-silhouetted (and terrified) Thandie Newton gives a very authentic feel to the scene.  Not to mention that the light also makes Officer Ryan look a lot more severe and intense than he appears in any other scene in the film.  You can see every line in his face, every detail - not many actors would do that - it's visually remarkable.

I wouldn't speculate about its truthful depiction of American life 'cos I've never been to the U.S. therefore I guess I have no right to judge. I can only rely on other reviewers' opinions regarding this matter. Besides the movie looks rather truthful.

It has a structure of multiple characters with different story-lines each that collide suddenly when we wouldn't expect them to. Certainly this way of telling a story isn't new at all in cinema, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that director Paul Haggis (who was mainly working for TV and a couple of years back wrote the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" by the way) brilliantly sliced contemporary society showing all of us how rotten and corrupted it is from the inside. What's more important is that Haggis was quite impartial doing this - I didn't see any edification and preachment in the film. And that served it good because had it been didactic and preachy it would seem pretentious and pompous. Haggis doesn't make any visible conclusions here, he just shows the people their alienation, anger, spite, selfishness and racism and lets them make their own conclusions.

Conclusion I made watching ""Crash"" is that human relationship is a very fragile and delicate thing. We can live in peace if we want but one single spark is enough to ignite the whole thing, and we won't be able to put it out. We have to try to respect those who surround us no matter what and be tolerant. That's the number one rule for mankind if it wants to see its next century. Don't do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you - and we might live happily ever after. And it applies to small things also. I met people saying some racist stuff and in turn I was saying: ""You're a racist"". And they were answering: ""No, I'm not, I don't wish anything bad for folks with another skin color. I just don't want them near me"". And that, I should say, IS the racism. Because everything starts with some insignificant and petty things.

By the way here I am starting to sound didactic and preachy myself (unlike Haggis' film). So I'd better stop. Anyway ""Crash"" is quite thoughtful, fresh, actual and not a minute pretentious. Although (I just have to mention) Spike Lee sometimes does this kind of work better.",1145232000,3,2303,4.625916870415648
2358901,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a remarkable film directed by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote last year's Oscar winning film Million Dollar Baby, and featuring an all-star cast including Sandra Bullock (Speed), Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda), Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary), Terrence Howard (Hustle And Flow), Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), rapper Ludacris (Hustle And Flow), and Larenz Tate (Dead Presidents).

The movie is delivered in subplots that eventually collide with one another into the overall main theme. The stories altogether are an honest depiction of American society today, a seriously ill society diagnosed with paranoia, bigotry, and ignorance.

What Crash does so profoundly is focus our attention on regular people, and their motives to behave the way they do. For example, the racist Police Officer Ryan, played brilliantly by Dillon (who earned a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance); he hates black people, and doesn't hesitate to sexually harrass a black woman in front of her sophisticated husband, played by Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard respectively. The reason he hates black people is because his father was forced to leave his job for a black man. Besides the white versus black scenario, the movie also turns our attention to the Hispanics being viewed by the white upper class as gang bangers, and the Persians being mistaken for Arabs. There's also plenty of character development, the black police officer who has a drug addicted mother and a delinquent brother, two thieves who ironically discuss matters of racism in society, and an upper class white married woman who chastises everything and everyone including a decent Mexican whom she thinks is a gangster who comes to fix her door. As the movie draws nearer to its inevitable conclusion and final crash, we get a closer look at the cause of the illness itself and find that there might be a solution.

Crash earned 3 Oscars (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing) at this year's Academy Awards. It's definitely one of the most controversial and important films of the decade.

2358902,5,B000A3XY5A,"Although, when asked about the best films I saw last year, the movie ""Crash"" made my top 5 list, I'm not sure it deserved the ""film of the year"" consideration given it, when the Oscar was awarded.

That said, and without comparing it to any of the other nominated films, ""Crash"" is, without a doubt, one of the most poignant and memorable films I've seen in the decade.  Director

Paul Haggis, a gifted Canadian, comes to the film with mostly writing credits behind him (he collaborated with long-time friend Robert Moresco on Crash).  A long time television writer who did stints on some of my favorite shows (thirtysomething, Due South and Family Law) but also created some turkeys (Walker:  Texas Ranger comes to mind). Having scored big with his script for ""Million Dollar Baby"", Haggis was given a blank check to film ""Crash"", which attracted an incredible number of ""known"" actors and actresses to bit parts and cameos.

Here Moresco and Haggis used the ensemble format so successful for ""Traffic"" to portray LA again, with all its foibles.  The memorable quote by Don Cheadle, as officer Graham, permeates the film and defineds the feeling of LA...""In LA nobody touches you......we crash into each other just so we can feel something.""  Crime and race issues prevail in the film, with Cheadle and the surprising Terrence Howard leading the way as black men, successful in fields where black men are usually in the shadows.  Have they achieved what they've achieved by essentially forgetting their race?  No race conflict of America today - black vs. white, Palestinian vs. all the other classes, Hispanic classified as lesser citizens...escapes notice.

  Haggis and Co. present the vignettes that invariably interlock with grace and wisdom.  Completing the film is a truly remarkable score, with the now famous ""If I...."" by KansasCali running through your head over and over after you see the film.

The rescue of  Thandie Newton by policeman Matt Dillon (who has previously given one of the most egregious treatments to the her as the victim of one of his traffic stops) is amazingly filmed and breathtaking, and probably revisited the most of any scene in the film.  By far however, the two most incredible scenes belong to actor Michael Pena, who tenderly has a moment with his small daughter, begetting to her his ""invisible cloak"" and  then collapses on film when his conflict with Palestinian Frahad (Shaun Toub in a great performance)results in his daughter's shooting.

There is no question that Crash is a well-made, memorable film that everyone should see.",1145145600,3,2575,4.9882903981264635
2358903,1,B000A3XY5A,"Crash tries in too heavy-handed a manner its attempt to interweave various plots with the themes of race relations and stereotype bias.

Instead of making a profound statement, the film is a skirting, shallow view of race, actually bringing down the characters in the movie to the level of cut-outs or stereotypes themselves.

Insipid and banal. Don't waste your valuable time if you like to think and not be shown.",1145145600,37,415,4.914285714285715
2358904,5,B000A3XY5A,"Best writing ever. Wish I had written it.

720 reviews.. hard to come in with mine now. I do not read the other reviews before I sit down to write mine. As I do not read the back cover of a DVD, or anything about a film before seeing it. I had no idea who was in it, untill I saw it.

This is a movie everyone interested in humanity and life should see (kids over 14, and only if a parent will take the time to discuss it afterwards.) This film should be shown in high schools, and colleges, and discussed. It is good.

I love that they abandoned the PC crapola that we are force-fed, daily, and went for what is REAL.

Hate to say the cliche - but, I laughed - I cried. You will too.

I am not going to list the stars, go to the website for that. I will say that no one star hogged the light. It wasn't a typical Hollywood ""I'm so pretty"" kind of film. Not about the actors. Not at all. The cast was great, yes, but no one stood out as a Flash, brought in only as Bling, to get the audience. (Like a lot of movies, that are not that good, but people go just for the draw of a particular *star*) I applaud the director and the actors in Crash for not doing that here.

Also, 3 cheers for NOT being PC. Hallelujah!! I am so sick and tired of politically correct BS! We all know that real life is not all polite and pretty, and that blacks, whites, Asian, whatever - each have their fears, their pre-judged stereotyped racial ideas, right or wrong. The dialogue said it all SOOOOO stinking well!! I was truly awestruck.

There were a few characters that I liked, or related to. Sandra Bullock was great - as one would expect, but in a subtle way. Not grandstanding and sparkly, but real. Was fun to see actors that I recognized from elsewhere. Like - Oh! There's Tom from ""Invasion"" and there's Noah Wiley's girlfriend from ER. The 2 black kids cracked me up! The guy with mom and brother made me cry, as did the Hispanic daddy.. that scene was breathtaking good, dam good! I was impressed.

There were situations of such irony, Alanis would be proud. Brilliantly written. I looked at my dear Norman, at one point, and said, ""Dear, we have a very sheltered white life, don't we?"" He nodded.

I will not give away the content - you have to see it. Warning - do not watch this while folding laundry, knitting, or making out, or you will miss too much. Pay close attention.

Lives that pass, or intertwine, love, hate, racism, one's that think they are noble and are just human, this is a great piece of human history that should be watched as an education.

Stunning. Memorable. Makes you think.

However, I can recommend TWO much much better movies that also follow multiple story lines and are based around car crashes.  Amores Perros or 21 Grams.  You might not need to see both of them, but either one would certainly be worth checking out.  Those movies have depth and emotion and REAL characters in them.

I appreciate that the movie didn't just deal with one ethnicity's racial problems. However, I don't like how the characters were treated. They were one dimensional, just a figure to emphasize the racial tension of that particular ethnicity. The ""coincidences"" that connected each story were too cliched to be believable. And I find it difficult to believe the level of blatant racism that each person in their respective scenarios encountered.

Though set in Los Angeles, this could be almost any major American city.  Shows us the precipice, yet offers hope.  Excellent acting, too, by all concerned.  If there was an ensemble Oscar, this cast would have deserved it. The film won the Best Picture Oscar it should have won.

2358912,2,B000A3XY5A,"I thought I was going to have to turn this movie off 5 minutes into the first scene; the racial stereotypes and cliches were so ridiculous. The contrived nature of most of the scenes and interactions really detracted from any credibility the film could hope to possess.  This might be considered a good movie if your idea of a complex and compelling exploration of racism is throwing out every hideous racial stereotype in the book and then excusing everyone from blame by making the point that everyone is equally racist. Crash is an insultingly simplified and unrealistic look at not only race relations but at humanity in general.
I had to fast forward through the scene where a racist cop who sexually assaulted and humiliated a black woman coincidentally ended up saving that very same woman from a burning car crash the next day.  Are we suddenly supposed to see him as some kind of hero?!  And the fact that this woman was in yet another vulnerable, powerless situation with this same guy was condescending and sickening.
Overall, the women's roles were either as victims, neurotic housewives or maternal figures. As for the black men - they were reduced to being either thugs or 'sell outs' who were unable to maintain their dignity and integrity because they had to get over in the 'white world'.  While I think the intention was perhaps good, the execution left a lot to be desired.
Racism is a daunting subject to tackle and bound to be controversial. Unfortunately, this movie is so contrived, unrealistic and riddled with ridiculous caricatures and false sentiments that it ends up only reinforcing people's fear and stereotypes.
The Academy seems to favor only the most overblown, grotesquely obvious and sickenly sentimental movies these days.  Apparently subtlety, well written dialog and a convincing story line are negligible at this point.  I hope others see through Hollywood's B.S...",1144713600,31,1904,4.990536277602524
2358913,4,B000A3XY5A,"For me ""Crash"" is a story which consists of several short stories that in some way become intertwined. All these stories are very well packed into a 24-hour period. It is an intricate plot which is set to play in Los Angeles but can take place in any other big city. It is about racism in general and prejudice. I see this movie as a collection of events which can happen but not so close together in such a short period of time. The whole story is not something that might occur in reality, although each single event could be reality. The story is intended to show there is some good in most people. Most of the negative traits, bad behavior, wrong attitudes or malicious deeds of the different characters are mostly the result of previous bad experiences for which each single individual isn't necessarily responsible. I think the movie is pretty well made if you keep those facts in mind. Otherwise the whole thing will certainly appear way overblown. There is all over good acting. The actors have been very well chosen and fit the characters they play. Sandra Bullock as the spoiled rich housewife is just brilliant. There is some bias against guns in the plot although it is never the guns that kill it's the people. The dialogues are well written and sometimes amusing. The film offers no real solution and will keep you thinking later on. You might even find some parallels in your own life. A second viewing will reveal many subtle details. On the whole it is a well-thought out movie.",1144713600,2,1495,4.602996254681648
2358914,5,B000A3XY5A,"I'd prefer not to say too much about this film other than this: SEE IT.

You'll be glad you did.

By the time this year's Academy Awards took place, this was the only one of the five films nominated for Best Picture that I had not seen. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was the sentimental favorite as well as my own personal fave, natch. Yet I had been hearing vague rumblings that if any film was going to pull off an upset, ""Crash"" would be the one to do it. Sure enough, that's what happened, and after watching this film at last, I understand why.

One cannot overlook the importance of storytelling in a film, and unfortunately ""Brokeback Mountain,"" as moving as it was, was hampered by a rather slender story. ""Crash,"" on the other hand, succeeds brilliantly at interweaving the stories of about a dozen characters, of varying races and backgrounds, over a two-day period in Los Angeles. In the process we are given a multidimensional look at racial attitudes and presuppositions. Props to Matt Dillon, especially, who deserves all the accolades he got playing a very difficult role.",1144713600,3,1285,4.62719298245614
2358915,2,B000A3XY5A,"Hard to know where to begin about a movie that wins the Best Picture Oscar yet manages to offend, manipulate, and generally insult its audience all at the same time.  Resorting to cheesy coincidence to ratchet up the drama, Crash cynically throws every over-the-top cliche about racism at you, then shrugs its shoulders with a vague, can't-we-all-get-along plea that smacks more of a Sunday School sermon than a serious exploration of racial conflict.

There is neither depth, nor daring, nor originality of thought anywhere in this film.  It's a rich liberal's wet dream about how all those ethnics live, and it reeks of elitism and unreality.  Jerked this way and that by choppy, improbable plotting, we're subjected to some truly repulsive ideas, such as that a racist, rapist white cop -- who should be in jail -- would suddenly, and inexplicably, risk his life to save the African-American woman he had abused the night before.  We're told that affirmative action -- the one great victory of the anti-racist movement in this country -- actually CAUSES racism (they'll love that at the local [...] klatch), and that its victims (immigrants, black street kids) are just as much to blame for it.  And THIS they celebrate as some big progressive statement?

There is some fine acting here, but it's hindered by truly laughable dialogue and zero character development.

A forgettable, regrettable movie that will besmirch the Academy for a very long time.",1144627200,20,1455,5.033333333333333
2358916,2,B000A3XY5A,"It is unfortunate that ""Crash"" has gained undeserved notoriety and acceptance, having won the Oscar for best picture. This film lacks, among other things, a sense of proportion or context which renders its assumptions without useful point. Everyone is equally racist with the same equal effect, so why change anything? Even worse, white racist assumptions are given a credibility that only the Klan could appreciate.

  Why did Paul Haggis make this movie? Was it because he was aware that some people noticed a tinge of racism in the over-praised ""Million Dollar Baby""-the screenplay of which he was the author? In that film, a mentally-touched redneck spouting racial slurs became a sympathetic character, while the black man who was the target of his slurs turned out to be the real ""bad guy."" And then the white female boxer became the victim of an evil black female boxer, with the unwitting ""connivance"" of a dumb Hispanic corner man. Perhaps Haggis, aware that the film was infused with his own racial stereotypes, wanted to make a film about stereotypes in general to ease his guilt.

  Unfortunately, the film is such a jumble of racial stereotyping that it is almost beyond credibility.  Many whites may believe that all blacks are potential thieves, even those dressed like college students; and so Haggis obliges the racial bigot by confirming that stereotypes. White women, meanwhile, are-despite the media stereotype-the least likely demographic to be victim of a crime, yet here we have another stereotype confirmed. Haggis even goes so far as putting views that would more likely come out of white supremacist's mouth into a black man's. Hell, if blacks are as racist as neo-Nazis, why should we concern ourselves with the latter?

  That is what I mean by a lack of proportion. White bigots who ignore the effects of their own racism--especially in the economic and educational sphere-point to bogus or exaggerated examples of minority racism or criminality which have little more effect on them than a piece of lint they brush off their shoulders. Haggis, of course, isn't the only filmmaker to seek to assuage white guilt by making bogus comparisons. In ""American X"" the neo-Nazis kill a couple of black gang members; but the reality is that white-supremacists are too cowardly to risk themselves in inner-city neighborhoods-their victims tend to be those who are most vulnerable, like James Byrd who walking alone and inebriated was tied to a pick-up truck by a couple of goons in Jasper, Texas, and dragged until his head was decapitated.

  This film has no value as a statement on the state of our society, since it does not allow us to judge in context. It is the product of the muddled mind of someone trying to justify his own stereotypes.",1144627200,13,2765,4.971800433839479
2358917,5,B000A3XY5A,"Loathe as I am to agree with the Academy, this film blew my proverbial socks off. It's a fast-moving, character piece following a dozen or so denizens of L.A. focusing on race and the subtle, and also less subtle, interplay between them as they are involved in car crashes, police investigations and personal relationships. Different types of racism are profiled from overt, outright hatred to more nuanced, but powerful, forms like institutional bias.

Odious characters are partially redeemed, seemingly `good' people commit the worst atrocities. No one is spared in this brilliant script as personal and social tragedies fly by thick and fast. The mess that is Los Angelean life is put under the microscope and each act requires a mental dance to figure out the ethics of the many protagonists. Fittingly enough, there's no ""black or white"" only many varying shades of grey.

Paul Haggis' direction is similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's in Magnolia, but due to its core message and convincing characters instead of stereotypes it exceeds Magnolia by a long way. Compare and contrast Magnolia's rain of frogs with Crash's snow flurry as a uniting element towards the end. The frogs symbolise the random, unpredictable turns of life, whereas the snow can be taken in many different ways; oppressive, cold, beautiful, all-encompassing, dangerous. It's even an important factor in many car collisions. The way the characters connect is also all too believable even in a city where famously no-one meets each other in the street.

While there are no concrete answers proposed to this deeply-entrenched mess of a situation there are hints that focusing on and enjoying each other's humanity rather than fixating on ethnic make-up is the only way to gain any kind of personal freedom and improve the situation. While this may be a little clich?d, the consequences of ignoring this message are clearly depicted and are enough to force even the most passive viewer to examine their own ideas.

This is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. Impressively, for a movie that tackles such complex subject matter, it still remains highly watchable, moving and not one bit `preachy' or patronising. Get yourself down to Blockbuster and rent it now, just mind how you drive...",1144627200,4,2272,5.050666666666666
2358918,5,B000A3XY5A,"I finally saw this last night and am still awestruck from the experience.  It was amazing!  Some dazed throwaway dialogue from Don Cheadle's character in the first scene is meant to guide us:  this isn't so much (at all?) about a car crash as it is about the way people's lives, and attitudes, crash into each other and set other things in motion.

I will try to keep anything ""spoiler"" in nature towards the end.  The movie's title also refers to the way it ""crashes"" your initial expectations about the characters.  If you're reading this you know by now of the horrible, racist thing Matt Dillon does to an upscale black couple in an early scene.  But he's later humanized as you see him suffering all night with...of all things...a constipated father.  He's still a jackass as he insults HMO manager Loretta Devine, but it's more than that.  In his eyes, his dad's life and business were ruined by affirmative action, and the results literally keep him up nights.  And then he risks his life to save the same lady he humiliated the night before.  Manipulative in hindsight but in the context of the movie it's perfect.

Admittedly I was watching between midnight and two after working way later than I planned, but I was crying at the result of the vandalized store clerk's attack on the tattooed guy and his sweet little girl.  SPOILER ALERT--and when we saw that the ""red box"" of bullets the clerk's savvy daughter bought for him were blanks!  Notice I didn't say whether I was crying with sorrow or joy at the attack!  (And later, during the credits when I saw lovely Marina Sirtis' name, I cried with joy.  I had to skip around to find she was the clerk's wife.)

More irony in the way we were led to believe there'd be a car crash involving everybody only to see this is about people's lives crashing into and affecting each other:  how about what happens to Ryan Phillipe's character?  We all wanted him to DO SOMETHING to stop that icky Matt Dillon feel-up scene, then felt his frustration when his black supervisor blocked him from turning Dillon in, cheered at his heroic save of...a character I won't specify...who happened to be armed...from trigger-happy cops, then felt shock and dismay when he overreacted and did something awful and irrevocable in his last scene.

In trying not to spoil the plot, that last paragraph necessarily glosses over the interest of many analysts whose concern will ultimately decide whether ""Crash"" is to be an all-time classic or a relative failure that dangerously mishandles the vital topics of racism and race relations.  In other words, are the interests of minorities properly addressed?  Is any group being made to look too blameworthy for the way things are?  I felt properly uncomfortable at the way people were treating each other in the first third of this movie.  We were all supposed to.  The makers set scenes up that showed several people in their worst light.  The pig of a gun salesman is an obvious choice, but don't overlook Sandra Bullock's spoiled rich WASP character.  She launches into an ugly racist rant when her emotions were raw.  But at the end, what is she doing?  Finding her ""best friend"" of ten years was (like her) too self absorbed to help her and realizing her long-suffering Hispanic housemaid who came through for her--again--was her real best friend.  Brilliant.

I'm afraid some may be right in concluding that the couple tormented by the Dillon character fail to overcome their status as victims.  This despite (or because of) Terrence Howard's actions in a later car scene, because those he stands up to successfully are also black, and he is clearly not at his best (reduced to bare, cornered emotion) when confronted by more white people (again being sensitive to spoiling anything).  However, the dialogue between Howard and his wife (is it obvious I don't know who plays her though she's great?) is, in my view, excellent and deftly addresses how Dillon's actions especially burn the psyche because of their color.

Back to the entertainment value now:  How about Ludacris cutting down the hip-hop industry in a ""Royale With Cheese"" tribute exchange with the guy who played Cheadle's brother?  Classic!  And the surprise turn of events between him and the ""Chinaman"" he creams early on?  Minor SPOILER alert:  turns out he Chinese man was doing something truly despicable, and Ludacris, stunningly shamed a bit earlier (""you embarrass me.  You embarrass yourself.""), actually does a heroic thing.

I could go on and on.  And I have.  Frivolous notes:  Didja catch the alien husband from ""Invasion"" in the scene with Don Cheadle in the middle?  And 2 seconds of Jin from ""Lost""?  And...Tony Danza?  How'd HE get in there?  It's like a Robert Altman movie.  Or ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World"" with racist overtones.  Now to copy this for the ""Full Screen"" edition...need those helpful votes...I hope this helped anyone reading this enjoy the movie without spoiling any of the surprise bits.",1144627200,5,4974,4.814639905548996
2358919,3,B000A3XY5A,"To me, ""Crash"" is a remake of a 15-year-old film that dealt more subtly with the issues of racism and class warfare but also dealt with these issues in and around Los Angeles. That movie was ""Grand Canyon.""

If ""Grand Canyon"" wasn't worthy of Oscar nomination why did ""Crash"" win the Oscar? I think because members of the Motion Picture Academy, when presented with a slate of bland films, respond very well to movies about social issues that affect Angelenos and, therefore, affect members of the academy.

This would explain why the average buddy film ""Sideways"" was considered an Oscar worthy movie last year and why ""Crash"" won it this year when better movies like ""The Upside of Anger"" didn't get a sniff.

""Crash"" has a wonderful cast and was co-produced by Don Cheadle, an effective actor whose stature in Hollywood went through the roof after ""Hotel Rwanda."" I heard the producers of ""Crash"" sent every academy voter a DVD of the film and that that was the first time such a thing has ever happened. Is that why it won the Oscar as best picture?

Certainly the academy responds to movies made by Hollywood insiders like Cheadle. Any Clint Eastwood film, however dull or unremarkable, is just about certain to be nominated for best picture Oscar and, in most years, to win the prize.

So is this a movie that's more about the machinations in Hollywood that what's going on on the streets of L.A.? Perhaps. I've been to Los Angeles but not long enough to feel the unflinching negativity presented in this movie. Everyone there didn't seem to me to be a loser, like all the people projected in this movie.

I am certain that, if there is indeed racism in L.A., it is more subtly practiced than the way it's presented in this movie. It is certainly more subtly practiced in the part of the world where I live than its presentation in this movie.

I can't wholeheartedly recommend you run out and buy this picture, even though it has achieved fame. I did not find any of its performances far from average even though its cast is starry. Nor did I find its storyline very enthralling or entertaining. I see much lower profile films that this all the time that are more entertaining and more interesting, not to mention more well acted.

As to the racism angle, I think that issue is better managed in older movies like ""Black Like Me"", based on the book of the same name. However, if you want to see a contemporary drama set in megalopolis that's full of big stars and eye candy, this fits the bill. Just don't expect anything worthy of the best picture Oscar.",1144627200,11,2562,4.590809628008753

All character's lives and interactions are related to one another (similar to ""Love Actually"").  Ryan Phillipe is wonderful and I wish he'd do more movies.  Terrence Howard lives up to his hype as well and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges makes a surprising debut.  While I thought there were better movies made in 2005, I certainly would have given ""Crash"" the Oscar over the other nominees.  I am sure I am one of the few people who didn't give this movie a 4 or 5 star rating, but still I recommend that you see this movie, if not buy it.

2358921,1,B000A3XY5A,"1st question - is this movie meant to be taken seriously with a serious message or not? If not - end of review. Watch the movie, enjoy the entertainment value, eat some popcorn....

If to be taken seriously - and presumably so winning 'Best Picture' Oscar somebody intended it to be, Wwwellll.....come on out to Virginia! There's not a lick of bigotry, biasness, or racism in my part of the country......! I have not yet in 15 years of living here, seen one act portrayed in this movie played out anywhere in any day of my life or travels. How lucky AM I??? AND....there should be no liars, cheaters, pediphiles, rapists, druggies, killers...because they too would ACT AND TALK like liars, cheaters, pediphiles, rapists, druggies, killers.... being so obvious that anyone could point them out a safe distance away - surely they must be as easy to pick out as a racist, even easier, racists being so visible and all....til now at least that's been a hard one for me to delineate....

2nd question - WAS art SUPPOSE to imitate life? Or be mostly entertainment with a message tucked in casually?  which would be different from say - a serious message in a movie created perhaps.....from that very bigotry? Stereotyping???!!

3rd question - has life become so revolved around cell phones, rush hour traffic, microwave dinners, whatever forms fast-pace life-styles take across this country....that the norm of Hollywood directors assume the 'sledge-hammer' approach is the only way to get our attention? That subtlety, the language of the heart, would be buried too quickly and lost on us, the viewers - under the pressures of our fast-pace everyday lives? That we generally would not be given the credit to know the difference between the power in our hearts and the force upon our brains?

There are precious few directors these days who understand the power of subtlety. And it's exquisite potential as a background showcase for the shattering affect of a 'sledgehammer' moment. How the result can profoundly touch and turn a viewer's heart like nothing else going far beyond the message into 'transformation'. Movies like this make me deeply appreciate those few that do.",1144540800,22,2170,4.950549450549451
2358922,1,B000A3XY5A,"No cute intros here, I need to get right down to brass tacks.  Many of my faithful followers have practically begged me to write this review.  I hope I don't disappoint (which - burn number one - this movie most certainly did).

This is probably (burn number two) the most shallow look at race relations in the U.S. ever to be taken seriously.  I realize that there are many white liberals in this country that love to be reminded of how ""inherently racist"" they are.  This whitey doesn't accept that.  Many of my black, Indian, and East Asian friends have dubbed me an ""honorary woman of color,"" which is one of my proudest achievements.  I've earned it.  The makers of ""Crash"" (burn number three) wouldn't know how to fit me into their trite, contrived view of America.

In a movie full of stereotypes, I think the characters played by Ludacris and Lorenz Tate really take the cake.  It's almost like (burn number four) they are supposed to represent a socially-conscious modern day black Abbott and Costello.  Where do people like this exist in reality?  They don't.  When Ludacris sets those illegals free, it is meant to be seen as a moment of redemption but in reality is a crime that deserves punishment.

Some of the characters are not even racist.  Take Sandra Bullock's character for instance - she's not racist, just not very respectful of anyone regardless of race.  She's mean to everyone, therefore no one likes her.  And the Persian shopkeeper?  He's not so much a racist - he's just a stupid, distrustful moron.  Yet (burn number five) the movie strains to earn the audience's sympathy for these total jerks.

Much like other unmitigated disasters such as ""Magnolia,"" this movie follows many story segments - with the various characters' lives occasionally criss-crossing one another.  The unifying events that tie all the characters together (final burn) are strained, forced, far too coincidental, and ultimately unconvincing.",1144540800,33,1944,4.92

2358924,5,B000A3XY5A,"As the winner for the award for Best Picture of the Year was uttered from Jack Nicholson's mouth this year, I was silently celebrating.  What a wonderful surprise.  Caught in the shadow of another socially controversial film Crash was a true diamond in the rough.  This stunning depiction of racial predjudice was a testimony of the hardships real people face each and every day of their lives.  While the film obviously dealt with the subject of racism, it did not base itself (or its hype) on that topic.  Unlike the front-runner for this year's academy award, Crash was a well-made film.  If one were to remove the ""controversial social aspect"" of the movie, he would find the remains of what would still be an entertaining and clever cinematic concept.  I am greatful to have had the chance to see this film, and hope that in the coming months more people will give it a viewing.",1144454400,2,883,4.658064516129032
2358925,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a bit too simplistic for my taste.  In many ways, despite the fact that it deals with themes of racism, power, and violence, it seems like the film was plotted by a 10 year-old with no grasp of reality, or interpersonal relationships, or an understanding that things and people are not always black and white (pardon the pun).  There are a few too many one-dimensional stereotypes and ludicrous coincidences for me to take any of this seriously, and supposedly life-altering revelations were just absurd.  Parts of the film are exciting and suspenseful but overall I thought it was a little condescending.

However, much has been said about the acting in this film.  Matt Dillon was amazing, with the only character in the movie you couldn't sum up in five words.  Larenz Tate is wonderful, as usual, both funny and menacing, and Brendan Fraser was horribly miscast as the ambitious politician.

2358927,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a clever and groundbreaking movie.  The story takes place in Los Angeles and weaves several situations involving prejudice and anguish; each character is usually portrayed as a victim and a villain at the same time. The movie seamlessly takes all of these people with their diverse backgrounds and their situations and brings them together so skillfully that any criticism of the movie being ""contrived"" seems provincial.  To reflect on any of the scenarios is unnecessary and perhaps a spoiler, for this movie is meant to be savored.  The acting is realistic; the action is riveting; and the story is marvelous.

At the risk of damning with faint praise, I knew upon seeing this DVD, that it would win an Oscar for best film editing, but it obviously has more assets going for it than that.  After seeing essential films like ""Mississippi Burning,"" I felt that ""Crash"" has filled a need:  It correctly diagnosis our societal ills, but it also provides us with a way out of our human condition.  It transcends it by showing us our better angels, and it does so in a way that is plausible and not at all sentimental.  However, this film is no mere sociology class; it is fine entertainment.  It is entertainment which provides anguish and catharsis, which is what the best entertainment does.

Perennial commentary has been fixated upon the Oscars.  While ""Brokeback Mountain"" was groomed to win Best Picture, it was a matter of choosing between apples and oranges. (By the way, I want the reader to know that I don't think you are ""phobic"" if you prefer ""Crash"" to ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and I am mortified by those who do.  It is a rash judgment, and rash judgments are what ""Crash"" is all about. ""BBM"" fans should see this film without prejudice and vice-versa.)  (I also predicted that the picture that won Best Oscar would be regarded like ""Ordinary People"" of 1980, and the loser like ""Raging Bull"".  There is such loyalty for each movie and great merits for both.)",1144454400,4,1980,4.785294117647059
2358930,4,B000A3XY5A,"This movie follows a cast of Asian, Caucasian, Latino, African-American and Persian characters in Los Angeles during a 36 hour period. It's easy to follow the story and characters, and all their stories intertwine. Every character has some stereotypes of other ethnicities, and their own anger and fear makes them even more prejudiced. One Caucasian couple gets victimized by a pair of African-Americans.  The wife then takes out her fear and anger by humiliating the Latino employees in her life. The entire story is like this.  Someone gets victimized, takes that fear and anger and later lashes out verbally at someone else, and it all rolls together.  In another story line, a storeowner buys a gun to protect his store and his wife, whose was previously threatened by someone. Of course, the next time the storeowner gets angry, he takes out his gun to threaten someone the next time he gets angry. Three cars burn in this movie, and there's a lot of swearing.  In several storylines, you see people having to put up with humiliating racist behaviour, because it's safer for them if they don't complain about it.  I wasn't familiar with some of the references, like Shanique being an African-American name, or calling someone ""amigo"" because they were Latino, or African-Americans being expected to speak differently from Caucasian characters when they're on tv.

The story was very good, and several aspects shocked me - likely because I am from Canada, and have never been to LA.  First, there's a lot of guns and fear. There's this palpable fear of being victimized by someone with a gun. The fearful victim then gets angry at everything and either a) buys his/her own gun to fight back, or b) yells at someone else in anger, usually making racist remarks and further traumatizing someone else. Second, I was shocked by the number of corrupt cops in the story. Is this what they mean when they say a police force is known for corruption? It's hard to imagine, it was shocking.  Third, the power of the HMO was a shock. That a man couldn't see another doctor for a second opinion because the HMO didn't cover it, was a surprise to me, as I am unfamiliar with HMOs. The best part of the movie, I thought was the ending, because almost everyone has a kind of redemption, where they realize how wrong they were to stereotype or take out their anger on anyone else.

What I learnt from this movie was that a lot of problems can be prevented by speaking politely and keeping an open mind.  In other words, don't take out your anger at a complete stranger and make racist remarks.  Every interaction with a stranger is a new one, so don't let your personal baggage colour your perception.  The movie was well done, interesting, had good timing and was thought-provoking.",1144368000,2,2771,4.75
2358931,5,B000A3XY5A,"When I saw this movie last May, I left the theater amazed, awestruck, and utterly jolted.  These all are the signs of an outstanding film.  Yes, the movie may have racism as a main motif, but that is not all what this movie is about!  Of course most of us know about racism and that it is alive today, but that doesn't mean we don't have to be reminded.

The great thing about this film is that it doesn't just cover one area of racism or even just racism alone.  It covers many races and many points of view, which makes it such an outstanding piece.  It is broad and applies to everyone.  It also shows how people interact with each other, about relationships and families.  It shows how people can change, whether for better or worse.  It emphasizes the fact that sometimes are initial judgement of people is not always accurate, whether it be a judgement based on the color of their skin or the way they treat us.  It teaches us about trust and to think before we act.  This movie is not just about racism, but about human nature.

In addition to having great themes, this movie has wonderful actors.  Yes, Matt Dillon might have been the only one nominated for an Oscar, but that is because in this movie the acting consists of an ensemble, not any primary characters.  And that ensemble one ""Best Ensemble"" at the SAG awards.  But the awards aren't the only things that speak.  Just look at these names:  Matt Dillon, who has amazingly given his comedic badguy a more serious and softer side that earned him a nomination; Don Cheadle, who follows his amazing performance in Hotel Rwanda with this equally amazing role; Terrence Howard, who is as amazing in this film as he is in his nominated role in Hustle and Flow; Ludacris, who is, in my opinion, a better actor than musician, and also has an amazing performance in Hustle and Flow; and other great names as Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Jennifer Esposito, and Ryan Phillippe.

This is an amazing film with a timeless message, and absolutely no film collection will truly be complete without it.  This became my favorite movie as soon I left the theater, and I am so glad that the Academy sees the movie as I see it.  This is definately a must-have!",1144368000,2,2211,4.507537688442211
2358932,4,B000A3XY5A,"This is a movie about original sin -- or as it might be called alternately ""the human stain."" Happily, it does not attempt to attach such sin to one or another specific ethnic group -- whether black, white, Korean, Cambodian, Mexican, El Salvadoran, Persian or any of the other groups that show up in this aggressively diverse drama. We have here an equal-opportunity movie about sin, though it's probably not an accident that the unfortunate soul who has the most to learn is a white male. Nevertheless, the movie is redemptive in its good-hearted attempt to bring all of humankind under the big tent of guilt.

So, the film meets a basic moral test. And yes it also meets a basic test of being entertaining. A stellar cast does a more than creditable job of dramatizing the interlaced set of plots that thrusts love up against loss, guilt against self-righteousness, and so on and so forth. I'm grateful for the various actors who were persuaded to play against type here: Brendan Fraser playing a seasoned DA, Sandra Bullock playing an ill-tempered witch, Matt Dillon in a part with little humor. Don Cheadle, the most gorgeous and talented male actor on the scene, already exceeds any part in which he is cast. Aesthetically and intellectually, then, the film is in harmony with itself.

Nonetheless, it is a bit heavy-handed in delivering its moral message. Um, that message is that we should not stereotype each other based on race (play that out against a lush rap sound track and a lot of pious tripe about how nobody in LA ever touches each other and you will have some sense of why this film seduced Hollywood in the most recent academy awards).

Even so, I liked the film. I'd even watch it again. The multiple story lines make it a kind of  ""Love Actually"" played out against a much more challenging background. It's a very craftsmanlike and praiseworthy experiment in multiple perspectives. And despite my sarcasm above, sharing the blame is far better than assigning it.",1144368000,2,1984,4.775510204081633

We have all been taught the lessons.

I want to make it clear that my comments are not intended to minimize the importance of the continuing battle agaist racism - it's VERY important.  I just don't think that Crash presents us with anything new.

One of the things that I really like about the movie is that every situation that is brought up in the movie is very realistic, the situations happening during the movie are very common, and that makes the movie an even look more real. I'm glad that they did not use any ""fictional"" situations for the movie; it would change the way the movie was interpreted. Even thought we do not see most of the acting, you can tell that each of the actors and actresses are into the role they play in the movie. Over all I think that the movie is excellent and is an example of ""real life""; a life that is not very easy, and that has plenty of problems and situations that change and mark our lives forever.

The scene in the gunshop where the guy is yelling at the Middle Eastern gentleman is superb.  It shows how someone from the middle east, after 9/11, can be a target for hate even though that very person may have been born and raised in the USA.  Sandra Bullock does an excellent job as a snobby rich white lady who is robbed one night and lets her prejudice fester to the point of no return.

I liked the fact it tried to explore the deeper psyche of prejudice, and found it ironic that in doing so it became movie of the year so people would not have to face their own prejudice against homosexuals, or love that does not 'fit in the box'. As this movie explored deep seeded situations where we face our own racial prejudice....which is from all sides, I might add, American society remains ignorant to their own prejudice not against homosexualty, because any type of love felt by most but not talked about, discussed or even faced. Love is love. And that message is much stronger than the message of Crash, which was hate is hate. You decide which DVD to buy, and which message should have won best picture for 2006.

OK, here's a pop quiz: Without referring to the DVD box or anything else, NAME one of the characters in this film. It's almost impossible. They're all types-- they don't register as people.

Leave aside the implausible coincidences and repeat encounters that would have you believe that LA has a population of 20 (i.e., the entire speaking cast of the film), does any moment ring true of this entire movie? How about that ridiculous ""Driving Miss Daisy"" moment between shrewish Sandra Bullock and her Latina maid, seemingly her only real friend? Why? Because she does her laundry and brings her hot tea?

People rave about the great acting, but I wasn't all that impressed. Terence Howard does give signs of having an incredible future-- he's truly good. Ryan Phillippe is moving toward a career as a character actor, which is a good move (worked for Matt Dillon). Still, getting 20 people on-set shouting racial epithets at each other doesn't count in my book as a great accomplishment.

But Lions Gate marketed this overrated, overwrought glorified Afterschool Special/Lifetime Movie Event to an Oscar by playing into SAG pride (""Look at all the actors we're employing here!!"") and older Academy members' knee-jerk support of all things related to Los Angeles (""No runaway film production here!"").

Racism, lets be honest, is still a strong issue in America today but I think the reasons for a character's racism should have been the focal point of the film and not necessarily the consequences of their racism.  We've seen that before too.

2358958,3,B000A3XY5A,"While the Oscar winner might take you breathless with the span of its message(s), it seems like a rehash of the same style used in the not-so famous movie, ""Magnolia"".

Magnolia (Tom Cruise was actually good in this movie!) when it first came out, was well praised critically, but did not fare that well in the box office.  Magnolia deftly fused seemingly disparate emotional life situations of different characters, and at the end (with the music slowly evolving to not unlike a sad denouement but with closure and purpose), every character realizes that they are all part of the big circle of life.  The ending of Magnolia involves a weird scene of falling animals, shocking and at the same time, mysterious, like the movie that it portrays.

'Crash' on the other hand is more hard-core and deals mainly with the interaction of races in the proverbially diverse Southern California.  We see the interaction of everyday people with cops, high power politicians with cops and everyday people, minorities that mingle with the society and how the seemingly 'white' establishment view them, when they are backed into a corner, or how the same establishment uses them to further their own agendas.  'Crash' is a rich 'melting pot' of hidden norms that can only excite people who live in diverse neighborhoods.  While it allows racial situations to provide closure, the movie seems trite, seems forced, and seems almost preachy (check Ludacris' almost incessant banterings).  We have cops who redeem themselves, but we also have cops who cause more pain in the process of helping these 'misguided' minorities.

Race relations is a powerful agenda, and Crash uses it to the extreme.  Sometimes, it does overdo and overkill the obvious, and we are left wondering whether we live in such a disparate country of cultures or are we merely pawns to racial hysteria and we are left blind to the minority struggle of having 'to belong'.

Go see ""Magnolia"" and compare the movie styling.  Compare the musical scores and the ending scenes.  It is shockingly similar.",1144022400,8,2051,4.979472140762463

I think the most significant aspect of this film is how well it has been written by Haggis. The characters are believable, their intentions are often surprising and most importantly we care about them. Crash has been criticized for being unoriginal, ridiculous and many other things but how or why I have no idea. Crash chooses to be very unbiased and as a conservative Republican I was not at all offended by it. There are liberal characters, conservatives, extremists, etc. and yet in the film we find that no one is above reality. I will always recommend this film and I'll tell you right now, I'll bet most of the people who do not like this film, are people who were in support of Brokeback Mountain, which I must say cannot touch Crash.

However, this movie was also a bit over the top, unrealistic, and at times inane. There are some touching moments, but you don't really feel connected with the characters, so it makes it hard to even care about the significance of how they got their redemption. As i said, brilliant cast, but not necessarily a brilliant set of characters. Obviously, this movie is about the dangers of modern day racism, but unfortunately it focuses on that theme SO MUCH that the characters come off as lackluster and boring. We don't really get a chance to know who these people are before they get molested, shot, yelled at, whatever. And the racial sterotypes they touched upon were just ridiculous in the dialogue (like when a white man says to a black women on the phone, ""Shaniqua? What a surprise..."", or when a black man tells his mom on the phone that he's f***** a white woman when she's really hispanic...c'mon...). I didn't know what this movie was about until I decided to rent it to see what all the hype is for...obviously, I get the point of this movie: Racism is alive today, and it's just as dangerous now as it was then. But with all the  silly sterotypes, yelling, people randomly shooting each other (or trying to), and people constantly talking about racial issues (so much that it seriously loses the reality that the movie is trying to portray...), it makes this movie come off as being too pretentious.

I think I showed remarkable restraint in not walking out of the theater when in one of the opening scenes we were bombarded with the most brain-dead, too-stupid-to-even-be-called-insulting derogatory racial stereotypes I have been exposed to since the 7th grade.

I thought it's saving grace were the wonderful performances. But that's all. The Dialogue was jarring and full of venom, but with very little substance. You get a dozen or so, breatheless characters who at the end of the day you can't even remember their names. The fact that the racism is so blatant and basically the fuel for their entire day, and spewed in every conversation is not what racism is today. The fact that though shocked, you really aren't allowed to care for any of the characters. Everyone is a villain. From the snobby black socialite who blames her husband for his mistrust in an authoritarian, after she has been molested. To the white-racist thief who somehow sees himself as the victim as he victimizes others. Every character is offered redemption also, does not speak to the true results of racism. Racism is very prevalent and dangerous. People lose their jobs inexplicably, their homes, their friends. They are attacked, humiliated, and murdered just because of their race. This is the nature of racism in our culture, and for all ""Crash""s talk it offers no complete truth to the audience. Just an abridged Hollywood version.

  What is worse, is that since you aren't allowed to see much humanity in these characters, people just can't relate. Instead they become forgettable caricatures. Meant to shake you because of what they say, but not who they are. The only question this film poses is "" are you a bigot?""... and thats it. It gives you no insight into how discrimination is bred through experiences, up bringing, education and your environment. Offers no means to heal. Just a poor jagged observation that keeps trying to poke at your conscience until you've succumbed like an annoyed older brother.

In ""Crash"" land, whites are the greatest villain, arrogant, rude,intimidating, sly, liars who commit murders & sexual assaults. Yet for all these traits they are somehow forgiven and find no justice. You were not embraced you were used. Everyone depicted in this film should be insulted.

And putting it succinctly, it was a revelation. And the revelation was how to make a totally unbelievable set of circumstances such that it leaves the audience no opportunity to interpret anything at all. The film started about 7:50 and by 9 I was practically shouting at the screen, ""Are we supposed to be taking this seriously?"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Then when the scene where the Iranian man fired the gun at the locksmith, I just completely lost it. I told my partner very forcefully, ""I'm leaving."" He pleaded for me not to, that it was almost over. I repeated, ""I'm leaving,"" and I marched out of the theater, threw my leftover popcorn and soda into the garbage (where I believe the film should be thrown), sat down in the lobby and cried for five minutes with my face in my hands, I was SO upset. How any thinking person could have selected that piece of garbage for a Best Picture Oscar -- completely unbelievable situations, contrived and manipulative dialog, amateurish camera work not even good enough for an SVU episode, and the feeling that I had been repeatedly bashed over the head with hate by means of a sledgehammer? I don't have time for that kind of anti-artistic expression in the remaining years of my life. I might also point out that of the 70 some odd speaking roles in the film, there was not a single gay character portrayed. Talk about unrealistic for the city of Los Angeles! The only thing that could have improved the film would have been a top-flight director and not the writer. Let me compare ""Crash"" to the 2003 British film ""Love Actually,"" which also has multiple diverse plot lines coming together at the end. LA accomplished its purpose SO much better than did ""Crash,"" but I will be forever calling ""Crash"" by the name it truly deserves, ""Hate Actually.""

Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard do sterling work in this tale of culture clashes, prejudices, and coincidences in Los Angeles, and scene by scene the film is gripping with some amazingly powerful and poignant moments.  However, the script's desire to throw stereotypes up on the screen, while brave, is also its weakness: too many of the overwhelmingly large number of speaking parts are, in fact, stereotypes, and no amount of happy wish-fulfillment or well-intentioned scenes that come across as patronizing (an injured Bullock embracing her Latina housekeeper and telling her she's her best friend) can paper over the fault lines the film purports to examine.  Cheadle, as he was in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" is the throughline of the movie, and his knockout final scene with his mother has a dramatic punch and ambiguity that the rest of the movie needs; too often, it feels like something that would've been incendiary in the mid-90's after Rodney King and O.J.

But this movie fails on too many levels to be considered a great film, much less a worthy Oscar winner.

The movie is far too contrived and artificial, especially the way the same characters keep meeting up in extreme circumstances. For example, the racist white cop (Matt Dillon) sexually gropes a black woman (Thandie Newton) one evening and then the very next day he saves her life in a car accident. How likely is that? Los Angeles is a big city after all and contrived plot devices like this are simply weak and unskilled filmmaking. Also the characters come across more as racial symbols rather than real people. The characters dialogue is very forced and not at all the way normal people communicate in daily life.

I especially had a problem with the way certain characters were developed. For instance, Terrence Howard plays an educated, successful black TV director who goes from being an ""Uncle Tom"" to an ""Angry Black Man"" during the course of the movie. Why is it that intelligent, middle class black males are so often depicted as ""sellouts"" who have to ""de-masculate"" themselves in order to make it in mainstream society? Many strong, well educated black men succeed as doctors, lawyers, engineers and college professors without having to turn into gutless phonies. But instead our media and society choose to depict all the failures - the gang bangers, crack heads and prisoners - as more authentically ""black"". To me this is the worst sort of racist drivel and it's a shame this movie only serves to further promote these false stereotypes. Also the Iranian business owner (Shaun Toub) is shown to be a confused, angry immigrant who lashes out in violence at that which he doesn't understand. Muslims are almost always depicted badly by Hollywood and this movie is certainly no exception.

2359026,2,B000A3XY5A,"The hype over Crash and its alleged insight into bigotry and intolerance in America may best serve as a sobering reminder of the superficiality of the public debate on these issues. Sadly, Crash's approach may be miles wide, but it's inches deep.

First, Crash's characters are, at best, stereotypes: the bigoted cop with a heart of gold, the successful black man under the thumb of whitey, the hispanic mechanic who is also the soft-hearted family man, the shrewish, friendless wife, and on and on. Some critics try to forgive Crash on the grounds that these characters (more appropriately, caricatures) are archetypes in some highly tuned modern fable--that there is some essential, transcendent truth that rises from these conceptualized people. These defenses are little more than examples of The Emperor's New Clothes. Characters in a play or movie can serve many purposes. However, none of them in Crash are served by characters that are, to put it bluntly, fake. In fact, the characters had the feel of people that one might invent if you lived in an ivory tower and never really encountered a flesh and blood person.

Second, the events in Crash, symbolic or not, appear shoe-horned into the story--relying on coincidences, or, indeed, the improbable, to make points for which such deus ex machina moments are hardly necessary. I felt as manipulated as the woman who finds herself rescued by the police officer who molested her. Sorry, but rule number one of storytelling is that miraculous coincidences that advance the plot or make a ""point"" are the tools of the inexperienced and inartful.  Crash is littered with them. And even in instances where the miraculous doesn't save the day,  Crash resorts to sappy moments of unconvincing enlightenment, such as the rich wife who breaks a leg and then has the revelation that the maid she abuses is the best friend she has.  It makes my stomach turn just reliving that moment.

The entirety of Crash, in fact, has this feel of looking at people and society through a glass that doesn't let you touch them, speak to them, or even hear them.

This has to be one of THE worst movies I've seen in years.  The storyline of the cop and Thandie Newton is so unbelievable, I couldn't help but laugh at it.  I bought this movie because of all the Oscar hype, but I just don't get it.  Too many things going on all at once and it just seems like none of the storylines ended.

2359052,5,B000A3XY5A,"It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.......

Crash is the haunting tale of a group of mixed race people living in Los Angeles whose lives become extraordinarily linked because of a host of coincidences that happen in one night. A car crash and the brutal murder of a young black American sends Ria -a white Porto Rican- and Graham -an ageing afro American- into a dark world of politician corruption, where white politicians resent the place of the black community and sexism is rife. Rick is a major politician in the Los Angeles area, but when one night he is walking through town with his wife Jean and is attack by two young black teenagers, his home life is plummeted into paranoia as Jean has to fight with the consequences of her prejudice. Officer Ryan on the pretence of pulling them over for speeding, pulls a black couple over and forces his college to make the man watch helplessly as he sexually assaults her. After driving back home the victim Christine finds it difficult to look her husband in the eye as he didn't help her and watches helplessly as her marriage slowly starts to fall apart, little does she know though, that the very person who caused the end of her relationship may be the one to offer her the ultimate salvation. The two black teenagers who attacked the mayor and Jean rome the streets painfully aware of the looks they get in the predominantly white neighbourhoods, but both go through journey's of enlightenment and discovery, but one comes to a grizzly end.

Crash is a sublime tale of prejudice and faith, hope and fear, life and death that transcends its issues by showing real people in real situations. It is a story about searching for your identity, the invisible and fragile bonds that connect society and the line between good and evil. It's a film of both epic and tiny proportions closely examining the human conscience, what it means to be a human -and what humanity actually is- and the dangers of xenophobia with shocking, stark honesty. Crash is terrifying as well as strangely uplifting because of its compellingly raw narrative, incredibly well formed characters and exceptional performances from the ensemble cast. The Academy Award winner is wonderfully contempory with a spiky wit that should feel out of place in such a deep drama, but only helps to build the movies steam roller pace and punchy emotional hits, the screenplay feels fit to wildly swing between characters and situations with real things to say, real idea's to put forward and a real intelligence that gives the varied and talented cast some amazingly rich source material to work from. It is not a film that pretends that there are any easy answers and doesn't pose that it has any answers at all, but to its extreme credit, it has enough conviction and courage to search for truths in the darkest of areas, to find positive in the most devastating of human actions, to wish for a brighter tomorrow and to step forward when other, paler pictures would sulk away in the corner. Paul Higgins -who penned the equally effecting Million Dollar baby- has such a keen ear who urban dialogue and talent for crafting plots that his narrative is just breathtaking and engaging, for such a heavy film, I was surprised at how absorbed I became in his world and was thoroughly moved by the complicated, inspiring, emotional finale. A triumph of modern movie making, probing, intriguing, mesmerizing and haunting it fully deserved its best picture win no matter what people say.

Perhaps Crash's most astonishing aspect is its massive array of realistic, striking and intelligent characters that really do make a connection with the audience. Each one is wildly different, with individual opinions and faiths but are inexplicable linked, their interactions are completely entertaining and crazily informed, their dialogue tailor made for each one and they are all beautifully three dimensional. No-one is as they first seem villains turn into heroes, people in the darkest places find enlightenment, criminals search for redemption and the self righteous fall from grace which gives the film a real edge that perfectly balancing the harsh light of day that the script presents. Another amazing aspect of the film is the confidence and ease in which the screenplay plays around with time, the narrative sprints from pasts to present and from character to character with gleeful abandon. This makes a small proportion of the film a little confusing but allows the characters to be part of each others lives in unexpected and shocking ways. It also gives the film a mystery element that will undoubtedly keep you hooked; using such varied time frames also means that the film eventually becomes a fascinating study of cause and effect, constructing a chain of events that does have both incredible and dire consequences. About ten minutes before the final frame the plot elements fit into each other with such grace and realism that you may just forget you are watching a film as apposed to a documentary. Again a lovely aspect to the production in the enchanting examination of what it means to be a hero, it poses intriguing questions about heroic deeds -can they ever be selfless? If so what drives people to become `have a go heroes' when others would simply walk away?- and crafts a really brilliant insight into how different people react when put under extreme situations. Crash is a brave film, with bold character development that pulls you in, some really fresh ideas that will make you -or rather it did certainly me- think about things in a different way and a really important, unique narrative that simply won't let you out of its grip.

On the performance front Crash is in my opinion near on flawless. Sandra Bullock really surprises with her portrayal of Jean, the upper class white housewife who has to struggle with the repercussions of her prejudice and the effects of her unfulfilled dreams. Bullock really does put some raw emotion into her role, with a real finesse and confidence in front of the lens, she has a grace and inner strength that really shines through and when she hits an emotional stride she really does some incredible work. Also as impressive is the recent BAFTA winner Thandie Wilson who again puts in an emotional performance as Christine, a women struggling with the hatred she feels towards her husband as he watched her be sexually assaulted. It truly is a power house performance that hits like a sledgehammer, her pain, her anger; her shame really comes across in a more than just affecting performance. Don Cheadley really is stunning as Graham the cop struggling to fight the inherent racism of the American judicial system; he is perfect at playing the tired, jaded detective with sensitivity and strength and has a real screen presence. Matt Dillon is probably given the hardest role to pull off, the first thing we see him do is sexually assault an innocent bystander but to his credit, he really does bring the character full circle with a really competent, intelligent performance.

Many movies centring around one particular issue or idea quickly become preachy or one track minded, often they stick to delivering a message at the expense of intricate plots and striking character development. Directors become so fixated on hammering through an ideal that the emotional journey takes a backseat and you end up with a production that has something to say, but not the finesse and style to say it effectively. Because Crash is so brimming with life this rather large pit fall is avoided gracefully with snappy writing and more than just one issue that it wants to try and represent. Whilst watching it I never felt that I was being preached to, but the film did make me think and informed my opinions hugely, I found watching it an educational experience and came out of it with a fresh look on racism in contemporary America. Because the script never imposes its own opinions on the audience, we are allowed to develop our own ideas as the form offers more aspects for us to mull over.

Crash is simply hypnotising thanks to the very neutral visual style, dark blues envelope the sets in mystery and pain, adding a great depth to the film, deep reds appear to shock the audience and yellows offer enlightenment and relief. Dark rain falls from the blackening sky as the big black UVs run through the roads, their windows blacked out and doors firmly locked. Long shots of L.A a glow with bleak lights that illuminate the darkness those offer some hauntingly well paced moments of silence, as the rousing opera plays in the background and the lens slowly drifts from one characters life to the next.

Overall I believe that it is one of the few highlights in the Academy awards history that Crash won the best film Oscar this year, the establishment didn't bow under the hype of Brokeback Mountain and I believe picked the best movie. Crash really is a marvel of cinema, go and se it.

DVD Features

Introduction by Paul Higgins: This is a really silly and wholly unnecessary feature that is just basically as the title suggests, it lasts around 15 seconds and consists of the writer director saying `This is Crash'

A Commentary By Paul Higgins, Don Cheadley and Bobby Moresco: I found this really, really interesting, Paul Higgins came off as a really intelligent compassionate person who offers a mine of insight on the production of the film, the struggle he had to get it made and his experiences directin for the first time. Cheadley spends most of the commentary raving on about Higgins screenplay and directing style, however he has a warm approachable persona that really come across.

A Making Of Featurette: This isn't the longest featurette that I have ever seen, but has surprisingly good production values and some real insight into the amount of sheer work that goes into making such a complex probing film. All of the cast seemed to get on with each other well, and the comparison between first takes and finished product are astounding.

Theatrical trailer: this is just you average trailer that only hints at the depth and intelligence of the actual film.

Music Video For Into deep: I enjoyed this, a haunting, slowly paced tune that suits in with the film.",1143331200,8,10478,4.82091212458287
2359053,4,B000A3XY5A,"Not so powerful as it is bad, Crash recieved tremendous hype - and I can see why. This is one of those multi-strand plots (Traffic, The Thin Red Line, LOTR) where viewers get to follow the lives of more than 2-3 characters. It also boasted so many stereotypes that sparked the racism throughout. The racist side of each indivudual eminates from frustration. Though it can sometimes be fun to watch confrontations, it can also be thought provoking and impecible.

What is so amazing about this movie is the abilty to intertwine different characters via one ingredient - hate. The all-star cast which includes Don Chedle, Sandra Bullock, Terrence Howard and Matt Dillon is not the only aspect for anyone to watch this film. Its the sheer commodity, understanding and tribulations of every individual can ultimately mirror an image of the viewer.

Crash is another film about racism in America, but it probably is the most inspiring.",1143331200,4,930,4.955128205128205
2359054,1,B000A3XY5A,"I'm originally from Canada (as is the maker of this film, Mr. Haggis) and moved to the United States about five years ago. It is from movies like this that people in other countries get their crazy ideas about the USA.

A lady in Memphis has ""Life's Like That"" as the title of her Amazon review.  If anyone who lives in, or has spent a lot of time in, the United States thinks that life is as it is portrayed in ""Crash"" then they should take their medication.  You can just imagine the poor thing in the community room of a Memphis mental hospital watching ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" on TV and thinking, ""Life's like that!""

A reviewer in multi-racial Iceland wrote that Crash is ""the best film I ever saw."" Of course, she didn't say if she has seen any other films. Perhaps Crash was the first. Another reviewer who uses the name ""Lujan Matus,"" and won't say where he is from, wrote that Crash is ""Astonishingly Realistic."" Assuming that he is sane, based on his name, I suspect that he lives in Spain or Latin America. There is a book by a Lujan Matus for sale at Amazon (check it out if you don't believe me) that, according to the editorial review, contains ""powerful life lessons and encoded information that shakes the foundations of cognition and transports the reader into alternate realms,"" so perhaps my assumption that he is sane was a mistake.

Crash is an attempt to raise our level of consciousness about racism to the level of Mr. Haggis, and it is too unreal and ham-handed about it to be taken seriously. Don't waste your time and money on this one.",1143244800,47,1571,4.479020979020979
2359055,1,B000A3XY5A,"No problem with the talented actors who crowd this film. The story is implausible. Overall message, we are all racist but really, really good super nice, too! In brief, the white DA, his wife, and young racist cop get or get away with everything they want. Both the African-American Detective and the TV Producer sacrifice their integrity to keep their jobs and their white bosses happy. The store owner gets away with attempted murder as the Locksmith does not call the police after his daughter---wearing a magical protective cloak---is shot in the back by blank bullets. (I know.) The TV producers's wife is molested by a white racist cop... the following day they meet again (fortuitous) so the cop can save her in order to redeem himself. She disappears from the film (until a tidbit at the end) as her role in HIS redemption is complete. The racist cop sacrifices his own father's help because he does not seem to realize what an ER is for and he sabotages his Father's medical care on order to punish a HMO worker for taking jobs of whites...how many times have you seen that one on TV? Speaking of ripoffs, the DA's wife actually steals from Driving Miss Daisy when she inexplicably says to her maid, ""You're my best friend."" Most of all, Ludikris smiles smugly after he releases illegal immigrants the back of a van he stole from a human-trafficker he drove over earlier in the film. That smug smile is for the viewer share with the carjacker: a sense of..""ah, we are all such good people, and its good to know that racism is still a problem, but we can all get along can't we?"" Horribly over-rated film. I assume individuals react to the constant hammerring of intense drama or focus on the message aspect of the film. A few critics listed it on their worst films of 2005 list.

2359059,5,B000A3XY5A,"OK, I'm odd.  I thought Brokeback Mountain was the film of the decade, and hands down should have won Best Picture.  Dammit, I'm SUPPOSED to hate Crash!

Except that this was the OTHER great movie of 2005, and takes exactly the opposite tactic as Brokeback.  Brokeback was a study in subtlety, layered meanings, what's unsaid is more important than what is said.

Crash is in your face.  It wears its heart on its sleeve.  There's nothing remotely subtle about it.

But this is a good, no make that GREAT thing.  It's not blatently emotionally manipulative like a Spielberg film, but the characters fly off the screen at you with a fierce intensity as they meander their way through an imagined LA where everyone says EXACTLY what they're REALLY thinking about people of different ethnicities and religious backgrounds, and it snows.  I live in LA, in fact, I live in possibly the most ethnically mixed neighborhood in Venice.  I have never experienced these characters in LA, because their exaggeration is both ironic and insightful, and their manipulated interactions, or ""crashes,"" advance both a story and a reality of covert racism.  By making it overt, racism is exposed and able to be examined with some shred of honesty.

Much has been made about how the triteness of the film's ""coincidences.""  Again, they're not random, or overy manipulative, but advance the story.  In fact, they are all extremely meaningful.  Altman uses the same technique masterfully in Short Cuts and Nashville, and Magnolia is another example of its brilliant use.  Crash doesn't QUITE make it into the realm of these films, both of which are singular and iconographic, but it comes pretty damned close.

Although it doesn't kick you in the guts like Brokeback, this is hardly a cold, distant, unmoving film.  The ""crashes"" result sometimes a reinforcement of a character's prejudice in one scene, and sometimes a transformation of the same character in another scene.  It's this constant challange, both to each and every one of the characters, and ultimately to the viewer, where this film really shines.

Whoever says the acting was sub-par wasn't watching the same film.  I'm sorry, I thought every single cast member delivered a stellar performance.  I was glad that Matt Dillon got the supporting actor nod, as this is the performance of his career, and I think he's very underrated as an actor (partly from bad choices of roles).  As the hispanic locksmith and loving father, Michael Pena was another standout, as were husband and wife Thandie Newton and Terrance Howard (recognized with a nomination for Hustle and Flow).  Don Cheadle was superb, as always, as was Loretta Divine.  Brendon Fraser and Sandra Bullock surprised me with how good they were.  No Miss Conteniality here.  The rest ofthe cast was equally noteworthy.  It's no accident that this film won the SAG Ensemble Award, it was practically invented for films like this with an amazing cast but no clear lead roles.

Balancing the fevered action is a subdued, hypnotic look and feel, aided tremendously by a brooding soundtrack that was equally Oscar worthy as Santaolalla's for Brokeback.

I was floored by this film.  I'd missed it in the theaters, but as soon as I saw it on pay-per-view, I immediately rented it.  I liked it so much that I bought a rental again the next night, and have watched it twice on DVD.  There's a lot of ""there"" there, and although I rarely watch movies more than once, this held up to multiple viewings.  (To be fair, I saw Brokeback 5x, this seems to be a year for multiple viewings for me....don't even get me started on Donnie Darko).

But having finally seen ""Crash"" in a copy loaned from my local public library, I can certainly understand why the controversy is so emotionally heated.

""Crash"" STINKS!

Let the dishonest ""no helpful"" votes begin (dishonest because they usually come from people who already saw and/or own this movie and are rating reviews based on whether or not they agree with them, not on whether or not the review was truly helpful).

The most prominent champion of ""Crash"" was Roger Ebert (and his less prominent TV co-host) who admitted in his review of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" that he wasn't familiar with the TV show on which it was based because he wasn't watching television much in the 70s when it was popular. Well, if Roger hadn't been so busy seeing movies, or, more likely the case, wasn't such a TV snob (as many ""film critics"" tend to be), he might have seen one of the seemingly endless number of made for TV movies from that decade that ""Crash"" resembles. Most were 90 minute ripoffs of theatrical films, and a fair number of them were produced by Aaron Spelling for ABC's Movie of the Week.

Some had their feet planted squarely in the ""disaster"" genre so popular at the time in which assorted stereotypes are thrown together in a moment of crisis, argue about race and other matters few people are likely to think about when (A) trapped in a subway; (B) trapped on a hijacked plane; (C) trapped in an elevator in a burning building, etc, etc. There was always a street wise black guy in a Superfly outfit that few blacks would have been caught dead in; the Jewish character, usually a delicatessen owner, who spouts various cliched homilies; a Puerto Rican with a pregnant wife; a homosexual (limp-wristed variety), etc, all in opposition to each other until the heartwarming finale when their nearly fatal experience has drawn them together, enabling them to understand that, you know, black people are pretty much like white folk, and Puerto Ricans and Jewish delicatessen owners are, well, you know, no different than the blacks who, as already noted, are no different from the whites, etc, etc, etc.

""Crash"" is marginally better because it doesn't trap its cardboard characters in a plane about to dive into the ocean, or on a cruise ship overturned by a tidal wave, or in a 20 car pileup on a busy highway, but it's still the kind of hackneyed attempt at serious filmmaking guaranteed to inspire snickers from those of us who know a little something about people and real life. Contrivance is a tool that every filmmaker uses, as does every story teller in any medium. When the story teller is truly gifted, the seams don't show. In ""Crash,"" those seams are dangling and coming apart in our faces, so obviously do the filmmakers hammer home their ""message,"" which has been delivered many times before, and more convincingly, too, whether it was in 1967's Oscar winning ""In the Heat of the Night,"" or an episode of the landmark 70s sitcom ""All in the Family.""

The performances are all mediocre, but it's hard to fault the actors when they're spouting dialogue that sounds like it was cribbed from a newspaper's editorial pages, albeit with the addition of the F word that filmmmakers think ""real people"" use more frequently than they do. Cops may talk like that, and street punks may talk like that, but most Arab store owners, and most respectible people, do so only in the heat of passion. (Yeah, I know. EVERYONE in this movie is lost in the heat of passion, but not credibly so).

Matt Dillon's facial expressions bring to mind the frequently deranged looking grin worn by Robert DeNiro in some of his lesser performances. And Dillon got an Oscar nomination for that??? Don Cheadle smokes cigarette after cigarette, as if he just doesn't know what to do with himself. Some of the other black actors get stuck with the worst, most unconvincing dialogue, deriding rap for perpetuating stereotypes on one hand, and taking offense that a white woman played by Sandra Bullock clutches her purse when they pass, even though these particular black characters are the kind who make clutching one's purse necessary.

Other ""name"" (as opposed to ""star"") performers turn up throughout including Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Brendon Fraser, Jennifer Esposito, and Tony Danza. Tony Danza??? Yes, Tony Danza, the former sitcom actor turned talk show host, whose appearance in a small role serves no purpose other than to make the audience say, ""That's Tony Danza!""

The music score may be the most pretentious aspect of ""Crash."" It's one of those New Agey things with an etheral vocal, the likes of which is being used too often in movies these days.

It usually takes a little more time to digest the Academy's choices for best film and decide whether they made the right call or not, but not this year. The Academy blew it! ""Crash"" just may be the worst film ever to be named best picture of the year. Two big swollen thumbs down for this truly awful film.

2359072,5,B000A3XY5A,"With the success of such films as Pulp Fiction and Sin City there seems to be a new style of telling a story where there are separate tales intertwined with characters crossing over between the tales.  This film takes it a step further and seems to be like a soap opera with several plots happening at the same time with characters constantly crossing over between the plots.  The director performs a masterful job of this and creates an excellent tale of many separate lives that reach a crossroad and expose their inner soul and then their outlook on life totally changes.

Don Cheadle seems to have the biggest part as a homicide detective that devotes all his time and effort to his work and his romance with his female partner and not enough time with his mother and troubled brother.  Matt Dillon is a hardened LA cop who has a sour attitude toward black people while trying to cope with taking care of his mysteriously ill father.  Rapper Ludicrous is a hood who blames the whites for everything while car jacking.  Then there is a Persian shopkeeper who thinks everyone in the world is out to get him and needs to have a gun so he can get at anyone who pisses him off.  There is a heart-warming tale of a locksmith who moved his family out of a poor neighborhood because a gunshot had come through his daughter's window.  There is Sandra Bullock's character who is a wealthy housewife who is mad at the world and married to the DA who is worried that everything that brings bad PR will hurt his chance at re-election.  Lastly, there is the black director who seems to forget his ethnic heritage because he is a successful movie director.

Each one of these people could have an interesting movie about themselves but over the course of two days their lives intertwine while their stories remain separate.  One can easily see how this movie could win best picture without any one actor nominated for the top awards as there is no star but just a movie of supporting stars.

""Crash"" is not about racism but about relationships. One of my students made me see that, and I am grateful. It is a story about Americans told by a Canadian, with affection and hope.

2359075,4,B000A3XY5A,"Perhaps the film may be slightly overrated, but it is still true that `Crash' keeps giving us compelling portraits of the people among the racial conflicts in Los Angels. That does not necessarily mean that you have to take every incident in the film too seriously. Some critics complain rightly that there are too many coincidences and ridiculous situations, and even the stories and characters that tried to be multi-layered and complicated sometimes look very forced and contrived. The film's strength lies in the joy of listening to a good storyteller, and Paul Haggis certainly has that talent.

For all the flaws that nearly reach pretentiousness, `Crash' has a riveting ensemble cast that represents people divided by the racial divisions, who do not crash each other in the normal orbit of life. But when they do, something happens. When an Iranian grocery store owner is badly treated in a gun shop, or when a white cop searches the body of a black female on the street, or when two blacks carjack a white man's car, these incidents all lead to another surprising events that even the characters themselves cannot foretell.

Yes, the ever-going changes of scenes and the interaction between the characters might remind you of Tarantino's style at his best, and director Paul Haggis never gets you bored with his considerable storytelling helped by skillful editing. Still it must be said that sometimes his script shows unbelievable chain of events that might be suitable only for TV sitcoms (especially that part about Don Cheadle and Terence Howard`s character), and some scenes are clearly meant to be very provocative, instead of just being thought-provoking.

Some names in the cast such as Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock might attarct you initially, but though their acting is good, their roles are least satisfactory in the entire list of characters, almost unnecessary ones. Instead, Don Cheadle, Terence Howard, and Chris `Ludacris' Bridges are most impressive, but there are lots of good acting (from, say, Matt Dillon and William Fichtner) and it is hard to choose the best. That is no surprise for even Ryan Phillippe and Thandie Newton are good.

Though the film is flawed with its prolonged coda, and offers no new insightful views on the racial issues, `Crash' is a well-acted, well-written drama that is constantly engrossing with Haggis' deft direction and capable actors, like a real page-turner.",1142985600,6,2426,5.103274559193955

There were times in the movie that I just wanted to slap my forehead. The ""comedic relief"" in the film was Ludacris and his friend with their hypocritical ramblings. Those scenes just made me mad because they were on serious issues that shouldn't be taken lightly.

Some people may disagree with me, but this is just my honest opinion. This film won Best Picture only because the old, conservative Oscar selection committee didn't want a ""gay"" movie to win. Brokeback Mountain was an obvious winner over this one.

I am not saying that the movie is trash, it certainly isn't but it shouldn't be watched lightly. It's a serious film that should be watched WITH AN OPEN MIND and preferably in an academic setting so that critical analysis can take place.

2359080,2,B000A3XY5A,"Most of the reviews here focus on the movie, so I'll skip that. The DVD itself is what irritates me and that's one of the main reasons it doesn't deserve more than a two star rating. This is just one of many examples how consumers are being ripped-off. Last year I purchased this DVD and just a few months later, we have ANOTHER version, now on two discs. Why? It's the money (stupid), and for some people never enough of it. And then they have decency to bitch about torrent and stuff. They asked for it. Why couldn't have this movie be issued properly with all extras the first time around? Not to mention that extras on disc 2 don't even seem too enticing to spit out another $20 for the update. What a scam. And this DVD is not an exception. It's become a practice to steel from us this way. Shame on those who keep doing this (see a phenomenal doc. movie Enron to understand their mentality), and pitty on those who keep buying (into these shenanigans).

As far as the movie itself, it's OK, not as bad as some reviews claim. It's a tacky subject, for many hard to swallow. Understandably so. It's 2005 and America's still dealing with the color of skin issues. If, however, you would like to see some much better movies on the subject, try one of the classics such as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"" or more recent ""Do The Right Thing"", all of these way better than Crash.",1142899200,20,1398,4.33587786259542

2359102,5,B000A3XY5A,"I remember when I saw Paul Haggis's latest film ""Crash"" early last summer.  It had a bit of buzz but not much but my best friend and I were so intrigued by the preview that we decided to give it a go and saw it one June evening at our favorite theater in Union Square in New York City.

By the time the credits began to roll and the lights slowly brightened, we sat there in stunned, bewildered silence; tears silently streaming down our faces.  We both concurred that we had just seen one of the most emotionally distressing, powerful, and moving films ever.  We were flat-out exhausted from the onslaught of raw emotion and utter truth about the state of our society.  ""Crash"" is a film in which both cars and lives slam powerfully and unforgivingly into each other, leaving the victims to sort out the mess. Following the lead of movies such as ""Magnolia,"" one of my favorite films, ""Crash"" chisels its mosaic from angry urban encounters and in-your-face confrontation. This is not a movie in which emotions simmer below the surface; they're quickly brought to a full, dangerous boil that may prove to be simply too much for some audience members to bear; this is NOT a film to be watched casually.

The incredibly large cast of over fifteen characters includes such familiar faces as Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, Ludacris, Larenz Tate, and Loretta Devine, is black, white, Latino, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian. The characters are cops, criminals, victims, and innocent bystanders, but in Haggis' world no one is innocent of the sin of intolerance. As in many ensemble films they often have existing connections that are revealed late in the game, and they divide and recombine in unexpected, often improbable, ways.

The film opens with racial hostility right out as Kim Lee (Alexis Rhee) has rear-ended a car carrying Detectives Graham (Cheadle) and Ria (Esposito), and a disagreement over who's at fault leads to an ugly dispute in which Ria mocks Kim's accent and her height and Kim accuses Ria of being an illegal and tells her to go back to Mexico. We then move to a scene in a gun shop, where the middle-aged white owner (Jack McGee) accuses Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian convenience-store owner, and his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) of being terrorists. Two young black men (Ludacris and Tate) have a debate about unfair treatment and stereotyping but then proceed to carjack some rich white folks (Fraser and Bullock) who seem intimidated by them. While any one of these scenes could work fine on its own, the cumulative effect is awfully repetitive, and the implication that everyone in L.A. is virulently and outspokenly racist hurts Haggis' credibility. Sure, nearly everyone harbors some racial prejudice, but most of us express it a bit more subtly, if at all. Making it so overt so quickly rather than building up to it makes us feel overwhelmed and preached at.

The film progresses through a tight series of such confrontations, many of which may seem familiar - the sheer volume guarantees that anyone who's ever experienced racism firsthand, from either side or as a bystander, will feel a bit of dj vu. Though the quick sketching of the characters leaves little room for complexity, it speeds up the process of making us identify and empathize with them, so that when they get in over their heads we feel a sense of involvement. As circumstances push several characters to their breaking points, the film sets up anxious, potentially explosive situations that could go a number of different ways, then makes us squirm while they develop. There's surprising tension and even moments of real elation. Few situations turn out the way we're set up to expect; one life is saved due to a character's bad intentions while another is lost because of good ones; though some ""surprise"" reversals are telegraphed too far in advance.

While Haggis' writing lacks subtlety, he's a great actors' director. The performances are uniformly excellent, and there are surprises from some of the most familiar cast members. Phillippe, though cast predictably as the idealistic male ingenue, delivers an unusually grounded, unmannered performance. Bullock, who is so associated with her comedic roles that we may underrate her dramatic skills, has a smart, impassioned monologue that starts with her anger at the men who carjacked her and those around her who've let her down but winds up being about her constant, low-simmering rage; it suggests that rather than being the proximate cause of her fury, the black and Latino characters she lashes out at are merely handy targets for her unacknowledged dissatisfaction with her own life. Even better is the scene between a black television director and his wife (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) that offers a rare glimpse into the conflicts between and within educated, successful African-Americans. After an unwarranted police stop, she's enraged about his refusal to intervene when a cop used the pretense of frisking her to feel her up, even stroking her crotch. She rails against what she sees as cowardly Uncle-Tomism while he insists that he acted the only way he could, that when a white man has the power there's no way to win, so you do what you must to survive.  The film is at its best in moments like these, when Haggis downplays his self-imposed obligation to educate and allows the actors to explore their characters a bit. There's some great stuff there between all the object lessons; if only there were fewer of those to slog through. Like too many filmmakers taking on a large subject, Haggis seems to feel that he has to address it comprehensively. He explores virtually every imaginable permutation of racism, showing that resentment breeds resentment, that those who feel oppressed by the stereotyping they face don't hesitate to do the same to others, nor do they necessarily grasp the irony. He posits that institutionalized racism can force a person to turn against others like himself, as when a black police sergeant (Keith David) covers up racial profiling and harassment by a man in his command so as to keep his own record clean. A corrupt system can corrupt those who must work in it, but overreaching ambition, too, has its dangers.",1142899200,4,6306,4.940566037735849
2359103,2,B000A3XY5A,"I had to see the movie that beat Brokeback Mountain for best picture, I was a little worried that this would be a better film.  Well, I was wrong, it isn't, I felt the movie lacked structure and consistency, while also painting a negative view of Los Angeles, and the human race.  Yes, we do live in a world filled with hate and ignorance, but  this movie does not teach us to be tolerant of others, it teaches us fear.  While, I felt Brokeback,was about unconditonal love and people needing people.",1142899200,25,499,4.450549450549451
2359104,5,B000A3XY5A,"The best and easiest way I've found to describe this film to those who have not seen it, is this: it's the movie ""Love Actually,"" but the exact opposite. Whereas the former is comprised of tangentially related vignettes pertaining to love, ""Crash"" weaves together a series of seemingly unrelated stories all about hate. Everyone who sees this movie should be able to find something to relate to, should be able to find at least one character to empathize with. More than likely, you will see bits of yourself in all the characters - even the ones you despise most.

Interestingly, while the film does address race relations and does tackle stereotypes and prejudice, in my opinion, it is less about racism and more about understanding. In other words, perhaps our racist tendencies - and, according to the film, we all have them, conscious or not - are simply an expression of our situation, whatever it may be, not an expression of how ""good"" or ""bad"" we inherently are. Ultimately, as different as the many characters are (racially, morally, socioeconomically), they share a common, human frustration that manifests itself as racism. In this way, the tagline (""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."") is quite apropos.

Packed with star power, the movie is well-acted, well-directed, and well-written. It's also balanced - don't expect to find a ""main"" character in Sandra Bullock, or anyone else for that matter; everyone pulls their own weight, and the stars aren't there just to add name recognition, they contribute to the film. And boredom is not likely to be a problem - as others have described, ""Crash"" is constant action.

I'm tempted to describe it as flawless. I've heard others object to the unrealistic ""coincidences"" that relate the characters to one another, but if you allow it that one Hollywood stretch of the imagination, you will find a film that is perhaps all too realistic. At the very least, love it or hate it, you will find something to discuss, so be sure to watch with someone.",1142812800,3,2019,4.846376811594203

The moral of the story is: while we may have many differences, we're no different at the core of our being. We all fear, judge, and hate. But when we give ourselves the opportunity to shed our ignorance, we can understand, appreciate, and love.",1142812800,3,515,4.863636363636363

It struck me as written by a rich white person in Hollywood who probably doesn't actually interact with any non-white people, and oh, guess what, that's the case. It's Oscar win is a perfect example of white-dominated Hollywood saying, ""see how wonderful and progressive we are, acknowledging how we're all prejudiced."" What a joke!

Each performer is given two specific qualities-  their racist self and their human self.  And just like a nifty puzzle, all of these sides come together in a rather absurd stew by the time we get to the ""revelations"" sequence at the end.

""Crash"" is a shorter version of ""Magnolia"" with an emphasis on race, which is a good thing but this much becomes burdensome and the messages become rather stale and may hurt more than help an already confused issue. The first time it was interesting and insightful and bold. The next few times it got old amazingly fast. How it won the ""Best Picture"" eludes me except to say that they probably only watched it once and whatever happened to ""Magnolia"" anyway and why couldn't they do a better job than this if combining the two? ""Best Original Screenplay""? It was bold and interesting but is more of a documentary on race relations than a movie in the long run which makes me hope people don't watch it too many times as to miss the message or blur it as I think they did.

2359155,1,B000A3XY5A,"Devoid of any subtlety whatsoever, CRASH purports to portray the state of race relations in Los Angeles.  Well, if CRASH were indeed accurate with respect to its depiction of race relations in Los Angeles, with which the Academy voters seem to agree, then I sure am glad I live in New York City.

Extremely didactic and bombastic, CRASH has reduced racial politics into diluted, mind numbing stereotypes and extremely broadly written characters that are nothing more than caricatures.  CRASH takes the easy way out, does not, and indeed cannot, with its large number of players on its canvas, delve into character complexities or at least try to mimic, if not actually depict, the way real people deal with racism.  Among its embarrassment of extremely unrealistic scenes (and the film is replete with them), a rich, well-mannered white woman (of the noblesse oblige variety) hurled insults at a Latino locksmith who is changing the lock of her front door and, within his earshot, accused him of planning to sell the key as soon as he gets the opportunity to do so.  What instead would have been realistic was for this character to express her concerns to her white husband a couple of rooms away in their large luxury home with no one else in the room.

Such white woman is somehow redeemable from this faux pas with the Latino locksmith because cheap redemptions abound in this movie: this rich white woman later slips down the stairs and, lo and behold, the only one who tended to her injuries was her Latina maid.  And just like that, the rich white woman declared that her Latina maid, whose services were paid for by her and her husband, was her ""best friend.""  Presto!  Her earlier treatment of the locksmith is forgiven.

Then there's the white racist cop who is the caretaker for his father.  He treats black people like 3rd class citizens, but Paul Haggis would almost make it seem that this character's racist attitudes were balanced out by his having to care for his father.  I would further argue that Haggis posits that racism is excusable when one has other personal concerns in his or her life, and that is simply indefensible.  Racism cannot be excused by one's family duties, no matter how overwhelming they may be.  And, as with the white woman mentioned above, a cheap redemption also awaits this white racist cop.  A black woman he earlier molests in front of her black husband is caught in a car about to explode.  And who comes to this woman's rescue?  Super white racist cop!  And at the end of this segment, we are supposed to feel sympathy for this cop, when arguably it is a combination of his duty as a cop as well as his instinct of self-preservation (after all he was in the car that was about to explode with the black woman he earlier molested) that truly motivated his ""heroic"" efforts.

Racism is not reducible to mere black and white.  Racist cops are nothing novel: just recall the Rodney King case, the Abner Louima scandal and the Amadou Diallo news stories.  Racism in the real world, or at least the world that is outside the bubble that is Los Angeles, however, festers beneath the surface, is much more subtle and covert.  It's when I used to walk around the malls as a teenager and was constantly followed by the security guards and sales staff asking me if I needed assistance, while white kids roamed about the store free from the prying eyes and intrusive conduct of store management.  They are comments passed seemingly innocuously by people who tell me that they could never tell between Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos and other Southeast Asians because they all look the same.  It's when people assume that no black person who works as a secretary or receptionist could ever speak non-broken English.

And subtleties like these are what CRASH is glaringly missing.  In this day and age, if there is one thing we do with respect to this most sensitive of topics, we DO NOT vocalize our misconceptions/beliefs toward certain races and minorities absent heated confrontations or inebriated/altered states, and, more importantly, shout out these beliefs within the presence or earshot of members of the aforementioned groups.

CRASH would have us believe that everyone walks around so wound up and ready to lash out a racial epithet to anyone and everyone whose skin color and/or cultural background happen to be different from yours: be it your girlfriend, someone you got into a car accident with, your hired help, and policemen in the guise of performing their civic and professional duties.  And if Haggis really wanted to portray ""duality"" in that everyone has good and bad within them, then why did he carve out exceptions for Asians, as exemplified by the film's Asian male character and his wife, who the film deemed as the only irredeemable characters in the film's throughline?

CRASH has dumbed down racism to the point that if someone tells me they feel like they learned something about themselves from viewing the film, I feel nothing but pity for them because they obviously have not experienced racism and they either live in an extremely homogeneous society or not in the real world at all.  There is nothing novel about CRASH, and there are no lessons to be learned from it that are not self-evident when one just steps outside one's home.

CRASH fails in every way possible to show accurately racism and the true evil it is.  Racism is complicated and for a project this ambitious, CRASH should not have been rewarded with the Best Picture Oscar especially when it failed in all respects--artistically, technically and otherwise--from achieving its, admittedly, lofty goals.

I saw most of the films that were nominated for best picture. the only one i didn't see was brokeback mountain and i'll tell you why. It has nothing to do with the fact that the two main characters are gay. It's a tragic love story and I don't really care for those types of films. They have been done too much already. The story doesn't appeal to me probably the same way that it obviously didn't appeal to the voters at the academy awards. crash was a movie that they could relate to having lived in the area. I heard that the voters recieved free dvd copies of the films. even if they hadn't they would have still been sent screeners of each film shortly before the awards so they could vote on the most deserving. In short, I highly recommend this film. See it and think about it's message. It's important.",1142553600,7,1267,4.239669421487603
2359183,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash, recently coronated Best Picture of 2006, is one of the few blockbuster films of the past 20 years that has tried to deal with racism in a meaningful, honest way. Although I don't think Crash is the greatest race relations movie ever produced (that honor belongs to Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing), Crash does come in second place. This film is important viewing for all Americans of all ethnic backgrounds.

As America becomes more racially, culturally, and ethnically diverse, what will be the social implications? Will greater diversity bring different races together or further divide us? The message of Crash is that the future is what we make of it.

Don Cheadle leads an all-star cast as a Los Angeles detective investigating a string of recent murders. His partner (played by Jennifer Esposito) is also his girlfriend, although he has not progressed beyond his own simplistic stereotypes and realized that she is not automatically Mexican because she is of Latina descent. Meanwhile, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) is fed up and burned out with his job and life in general. His blue-collar father missed out on the American Dream, and the son holds ""minorities"" and ""special programs"" responsible for this - fueling a rage against all people of color. Rap-star Ludicrous and his sidekick are the type of people that Ryan hates: young, black, urban males with criminal backgrounds. Terrance Howard and Thandie Newton are a happily married couple, until Howard finally snaps at being forced to live a double life - neither ""black"" enough for his wife, nor ""white"" enough for his supervisors. And the list of characters goes on and on...

Most discussions of race in America tend to focus on a strict black-white paradigm. Crash advances beyond this dichotomy as it indtroduces characters of Middle Eastern/Muslim, Mexican-American, Latina, and Asian descent into the plot. Although some characters in Crash are straight-up stereotypes (Ludicrous as the dangerous black male, Matt Dillon as the working-class white racist, and Sandra Bullock as the uppity bigoted white snob), there is enough character variety overall in this film: some characters are fiesty, others are more mellow, and some are middle of the road.

Crash offers no solutions and takes no sides. There are no clear-cut ""good guys"" or ""bad guys."" The only ""bad guy"" is racial prejudice itself, for putting us in this situation in the first place. You owe it to yourself to see Crash. We need many more films like this.",1142553600,7,2493,5.043689320388349
2359184,5,B000A3XY5A,"""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""

These are the first lines spoken by Police Detective, Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) in Paul Haggis' Academy Award winning film, ""Crash"". In the film we watch how in a 36 hour period (mostly in the night), Detective Waters and more than a dozen diverse characters of different race, culture and economic class cross paths and both literally and emotionally 'Crash' into each other.

Director-Writer, Paul Haggis' film examines the complexity of racial relations. The emotionally moving script provides no real answers to our problems of racism. Instead it holds up a mirror and looks at the people involved. There are no 'good guys' or 'bad guys'. No, white or black hats are worn. None of these characters turn out to be as they initally seem. All of them eventually are put into emotionally dramatic situations, where either they find some good in themselves or they are forced to confront darker parts of their personalities, that they are loathed to admit exist. As Matt Dillon's openly racist LAPD cop tells his rookie partner, ""You think you know who you are? You have no ideal"". That one line pretty much sums up what ""Crash"" is about.

""Crash"" won the 2006 Acadamy Award for ""Best Motion of the Year"" and for once the Academy got it right. Haggis provides amazing direction and a wonderful script featuring well rounded, interesting characters. The entire ensemble cast is brilliant. Standouts include Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, Ludacris, Michael Pena and Shaun Toub. I'm moved by their performances every time I see this film.

Finally, I want to mention two technical aspects of the film. James Muro's beautiful cinematography, really makes the City of L.A. come alive seeming both inviting and dangerous. This is such a beautiful movie to watch. Also, I absolutely love Mark Isham's amazing musical score, which so inhances the emotional mood of the film. This is punctuated by the beautiful ending song ""In the Deep"" (written & sung by Bird York) which I absolutely love. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years.

I would highly recommend the two DVD disc, ""Directors Cut"" of this film. This DVD set features several excellent documentaries on the making of the movie plus deleted scenes, music videos and script & story board comparisons. Best of all is the well informed commentary track from Writer/Director, Paul Haggis and Actor/Producer, Don Cheadle. They talk in detail about the making of the film and its themes and storylines.

This is a wonderful film drama. I've seen it a number of times and always find myself emotionally moved by it. Isn't that what great filmmaking is all about? Fantastic movie! Highly recommended!",1142553600,,2998,4.926732673267327

2359186,4,B000A3XY5A,"So theres been a lot of hoopla over Crash beating Brokeback at this years Oscars. As a dedicated film watcher (Though not profesionaly) I can give my honest opinion and hopefully be unbiased. Crash is a great film, every actor in it put all their effort into their preformances both in and out of the camera. I also think the over all message of the film is beautiful, we really should stop judging each other on outward appearances. Now did Crash deserve to win Best Picture, in my opinion, no. Both Good Night and Good Luck and Brokeback are both better films than Crash, and what makes me mad is that I loved Crash, and its message is truly universal, but now I cant watch Crash without having a little bit of a grudge against it for beating what was obviously an instant classic like Brokeback, thanks Academy for ruining my opinion of a good movie. The dialouge in Crash, though powerful, is obviously trying to teach us something, and hey theres nothing wrong with that but it wasn't real, i can relate to Crash because I've had those thoughts before but I don't think anyone really says them out loud. Thats why I don't think it deserved best film, its easy to put all your cards on the table, but to hold your emotions in, to convey so much in simple conversations about babysitting or work the way the characters in Brokeback do, that is true acting and storytelling.

As for the acting, there are definately some hits and some misses, the strongest are I think Thandie Newton as a succesful black woman who gets molested by a police officer and the Mexican  locksmith (Sorry don't remember the actor's name) Their snubs at the oscars amaze me, Thandie portrayed a flawless mixture of anger and hurt at the fact that her husband did nothing to protect her, and the scenes with the locksmith and his daughter are some of the most heartbreaking in recent years. By the way, how did Rachel Weisz win Best Supporting Actress this year, to say that her preformance was better than Michelle Williams in Brokeback or Amy Adams in Junebug is a complete joke. Now for the misses, for all the accolades that Matt Dillon received, sorry but I thought he was the weakest, Terrance Howard and Don Cheadle gave way better preformances, but I guess fame counts for something in this business.

Many people wonder if Crash won Best Picture than why didn't it get Best Director. First of all I think the Academy wanted to make it look like they weren't snubbing Brokeback (sorry didn't fool me) and second I don't think Paul Haggis' directing had much to do with the power of Crash, he had the luck of getting an awesome cast and I truly believe any director could of had a hit with a cast this good. Now compare that to Ang Lee and Stephen Speilberg who had to work with actors who have often been criticized for over acting and you can see how hard their job was compared to Haggis'

If you're looking for a good film to watch but you're uncomfortable with the themes in Brokeback pick up Crash you won't regret it. But if you want to see true American film-making at its greatest watch Brokeback, its not a political film, it was made that way by both the prejudice groups against homosexuality and by the rainbow waving activists who are giving Crash one star when it deserves more, BBM is a simple story that delves into what it means to be a man and the lonelyness men often feel because we cant allow ourselves to be in touch with our emotions, I think of it more like Of Mice and Men taken to the next level. Hey pick up both, they're 2 great movies in one of the greatest years in films and will both be viewed as classics years from now.

P.S. can we please stop the arguing between BBM and Crash fans, yes BBM did get a crappy deal but its not like its lacking in the awards department, its broken new records with the amount of awards its won, and Crash, although flawed, isn't the worst movie to win the Best Picture Oscar, I mean have you guys seen American Beauty?",1142380800,6,3971,4.441700960219479

It easily makes my list of all time favorite movies, but something another person wrote on a post got me thinking, I can't believe the thought never occured to me.

I am curious as to why the film makers did not decide to add a gay character(s) to the mix, after all this group has had some of the fiercest discrimination in recent memory.",1142380800,3,585,4.3090909090909095

2359190,4,B000A3XY5A,"I have to admit that at first I did not know what to expect from this film, but as it turns out it is worth much of the praise it has received, though not all.

Crash brings to the screen a set of parallel stories that take place in Los Angeles, over a period of 36 hours, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in various ways.

The film does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  The main theme is racism in the USA and the mess they've all seem to have gotten themselves in over there (the so-called melting pot), and which demonstrates itself at every opportunity, most notably during natural as well as man-made disasters.

Nevertheless, the film also sends the message (as it should do) that there is hope and that there will always be hope.

What I found especially interesting is how one group in particular, which is small in numbers and yet has an extremely and unusually high profile, is mysteriously absent from this film.  What is even more interesting is that this particular group always finds itself in the forefront in matters of discrimination, but also of US politics (as of lately), the media, and Hollywood (as producers usually/mostly, but also and to a lesser degree as directors and actors, and always successful).  So to have them being absent from a film such as this is surprising indeed.

Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!

The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

You've never been walking down the street and something uncomfortable comes along and you cringe.  The ""f-word"" is a common word.  People say it often.  Therefore it makes sense in this film.  If you watch the ROCK with Sean Connery you'll hear the F-word a bunch more and then you'll probably  die from shock that people actually speak like that.

back to the film.  Crash was a powerful film and totally deserved to win best picture.  I found myself shocked at the attrocities of human nature, and the fact that most of this takes place near me made it even more real.

But White liberals also accuse White people who don't share their beliefs as being racist, which is a contradictory accusation if they are racist too. What I think they mean when say that all White people are racist is that all White people are racist, except for White people like them.

The White liberals who made this film go even further and seem to be saying that we are all racist, even Black people like me.  But, again, you get the feeling that the movie makers don't think they are racist. They are so smart and perceptive that they are above us all.  If only we could be like them!  I think the people giving this film good reviews are self-righteous White people who think like that.

As a Black man living in America, I have had a few minor prejudicial experiences, especially late at night when the street is mostly deserted and I pass people of other races and they seem nervous. But I'm a big guy and the fact is that here in Phillie there are more brothers who mug than Whites.  I don't like making a big deal about it and nor should White liberals who don't know as much about other races as they think they do.

The worst part of it is that a few older actors admitted they didn't want to see Brokeback Mountain , so it appears they voted for this by default. (frankly, those actors shouldn't be voting if they haven't seen the movies and should be kicked out of the academy).

It doesn't really matter anyway, the oscars have lost all integrity. The Crash team basically paid for their 'best picture' award. (The distributor even admitted that the few million they spent sending 130,000 dvds to academy members would pay off in about $10 million in additional revenue for Crash if they could get it to win 'best picture').

If you want an idea of what movies to watch based on awards from organizations with members who are movie fanatics and actually watch the movies that they vote for, then I would say check out the GOLDEN GLOBES, the INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARDS and the BAFTA (basically the British top movie awards).

The other female driver then proceeds to insult the Asian diver by mocking her lousy accent, ""no, I did blakey in time"". They then proceed to whine and complain for the next 5 minutes.  A parade of miserable, unlikeable, pessimistic characters will follow.  They are all basically the same character with the same speech pattern.  They incessantly complain and whine!  The DA's wife moans about everything, the racist cop complains about the HMO, the producer's wife complains that he isn't black enough, the producer complains that she complains too much.  As these initial characters meet up with other characters, we get hit with a second wave of whining.  When the carjacker brings the car to the cop shop, the guy complains that the car has too much blood on it.  When the racist cop's partner asks his superior to switch him with a new partner, the superior starts ranting about how hard it it to move up in the department.  This movie has the most unrealistic dialogue i have ever heard. Nobody i have ever met speaks like this.  Some of the scenes are pretty unrealistic too.  For example, the homicide detective interrrupts hot sex so he can have a back and forth whine session with his partner about his lack of maternal respect and her ethnicity.  Give me a break!  The only thing he should be complaining about is the bad dialogue.  I don't know about you, but I want to be entertained when I see a movie.  I don't need to listen to this crap.  I would rather be at work, I get less complaints there.

2359233,5,B000A3XY5A,"The controversial Best Picture Oscar winner, Paul Haggis' CRASH is an angry, very profane, and disturbing portrait of Los Angeles over about 24 hours in the lives of maybe twenty people of different races.  The vast and impersonal metropolis, where no one really sleeps, is brilliantly captured from early evening, to late night, to the wee hours up on Mulholland Drive, to blinding smoggy morning, to golden orange afternoon with a spectacular car crash, to night again.

The leading players include Sandra Bullock (never better as a nasty West Side socialite who berates all of her hired help), Don Cheadle (as a black homicide detective and the closest thing to a leading actor here), Oscar nominee Matt Dillon (as a racist white patrolman about to retire and trying to take care of his dad), Terence Howard (as a decent black man whose wife is harrassed without cause by Dillon), Brendan Fraser as Bullock's  husband, and about a dozen others I don't really know, including a key Middle Eastern character.

There is not a lot of plot in co-writer (with Bobby Moresco) Haggis' Oscar-winning screenplay.  On the West Side, white Bullock and D.A. husband Fraser fight a lot.  Dillon is called a ""racist prick"" by his own black boss and has Ryan Phillippe as his partner, who wants to be transferred to someone less volatile.  But Dillon has his good points, as he saves the life of a Hispanic woman pinned under a car in a bad car crash that is about to trigger a multi-car explosion.  Dillon is also fighting with an unfeeling black hospital supervisor (Loretta Devine) for medical care for his father.  He should have won the Supporting Actor Oscar.  Meanwhile, black Cheadle is a major homicide detective and a decent man whose only flaw is to call his Central American girl friend a Mexican.  Meanwhile, the Middle Eastern shop owner yells at a black locksmith to fix a lock on a door that needs replacing, but the locksmith says a door person needs to fix that so the lock change will be workable; the store owner adamantly says no, fix the lock, and his store is hopelessly vandalized that night-and his little daughter is shot at in a horrible crossfire scene.  CRASH is weak on storyline, but very strong on complex and interesting characters, provocative conflicts, and strong ensemble acting.

It is also a visual tapestry of the various moods of Los Angeles around the clock.  The ""night for night"" Panavision is particularly impressive.  J. Michael Moro is the magnificent cinematographer, and Laurence Bennett is credited on the DVD box as production designer.  They know exactly where the freshest LA locales are and how to capture them by day, evening, and the dark night of the soul, when it is too hot to sleep and everyone seems to have insomnia.

Should CRASH have beat crowdpleaser BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN?  It is like comparing apples and oranges; I prefer one on one day and the other on another day.  I am going to be unpopular and say CRASH is probably a better movie in terms of ambitions and results.  BROKEBACK is a wonderful and sad western that makes an important statement about gay relationships.  But I have a hunch that people able to get past its non-stop profanity are going to embrace CRASH as a brilliant and incendiary and gripping movie gem and discuss it decades from now as an important work of art.

The commercials emphasized Sandra Bullock, America's sweetheart, as a foul mouthed, mean spirited, rich, rigid, racist white woman, and Ludicrous as a witty, charismatic, black carjacker.

""Oh, no,"" I thought, ""just what we need. More Hollywood Limousine Liberal one-dimensional pablum about how we should just all get along. Another 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'"" A funny thing happened, though. Many acquaintances, from a variety of backgrounds, approached me to urge me to see the film. They were moved by this movie in a way that I haven't seen people be moved by a movie in years.

Then, when ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for best picture, I thought, okay, I need to see this, even if just as a cultural artifact.

Boy, was I surprised. ""Crash"" was nothing like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" except in that it has a great cast.

The script is sharp and fast and literate. Characters manage to say memorable things without sounding artificial (for the most part.) I miss Joe Mankiewicz. I miss great scripts. ""Crash"" is a treat for fans of language.

The cast is just, plain, unbelievably fine. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza -- who would have guessed that these stars could have done the kind of intensely moving work that they do here? Matt Dillon gave a performance, and created a character, that I will simply never forget.

Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, and Loretta Devine are also great, but not as surprising, because they don't play against type. The actors playing a Persian shop keeper and his daughter, a locksmith ... Each performance is stunning, perfect, moving.

Terrence Howard ... what can I say? I'm running out of words. Terrence Howard was exquisitely moving.

Ryan Phillipe. Keith David.

Just, standing on my chair, applauding. This movie gave me a whole new appreciation of acting as a profession.

""Crash"" consists of one stunning moment after another that wrenches both with its realness and its artistic merit. I've lived some of those moments: a father reassures his daughter with a tale of a protective cloak; a woman embraces someone whom she suddenly recognizes as a friend; a man says he doesn't want to apologize any more; a son tries to help his ill father.

Most movies would be lucky to create one such scene.

Some have argued that the movie is contrived. To those folks I'll report: movies *are* contrived. See, Matt Dillon is not actually a police officer ...

I didn't find one moment of ""Crash"" to be unbelievable. We've all had moments of coincidence that defied chance. That's why the word ""synchronicity"" exists.

Others objected that the movie is preachy. I've really got to wonder about the lives of the folks who found this movie preachy. I live in a very multicultural, multiracial world. Events like those in ""Crash"" happen in the world I inhabit. Unlikely allies do form. People do sell out. Deals are cut. Rescues are made, and lives are lost.

How is depicting these realities on screen ""preachy""?

I'm wary of overuse of words like ""preachy"" and ""manipulative"" in film reviews. They tend to be used by people who like movies shot through gauze in the South of France where the only thing that happens is that Charlotte Rampling gazes off soulfully into the distance.

I think many, too, had a problem with what is on screen in ""Crash."" The white supremacist bad guy everyone is primed to hate is revealed to be a complex human being. Blacks are not depicted as blameless; some steal, are rude, and make racist comments. I think that that bit of reality will disturb some movie goers.

Some argued that the movie ends too neatly. I didn't see any neat ending. In the end, there is life, and there is death, and mere chance separates the two. The final sounds in the movie are a new racial confrontation beginning.

The film's sheer artistry, and its soundtrack, make all the horror it exposes bearable. This movie left me exhilarated. If we can produce movies like this, maybe we can learn to all just get along.",1142208000,13,4080,4.8111587982832615
2359238,3,B000A3XY5A,"One of the better movies of 2005, but doesnt have anything new to offer to the audience, other than playing on their emotions.

It didn't have to be rewarded with an oscar, as it conveys the wrong message that American society is inherently prejudiced and racistic.

The movie makers might not have meant to convey that meaning, but as it doesnt present any end solution nor does it impart a decent message to the viewers, it unfortunately ends up as being a mere show-case of American racial prejudices.

Dont think of me as a right wing American patriot, I'm actually from India, belong to the Hindu majority community, from a city that has a huge muslim population. I'd several muslim friends who used to advise me not to venture into muslim localities during nights and evenings.

Thats quite similar to the predicament of a white person, being advised to stay away from black dominated areas after nightfall.

And at present, living in US, I'm a minority. The closest I've come to being discriminated here, is when I'm usually mistaken as a hispanic and strangers accost me speaking in spanish, a language I'm utterly unfamiliar with.

Its trivial knowledge that majority communities alone donot discriminate people, minorities do it as well, either due to isolation or propaganda by unscrupulous politicians, numerous reasons abound.

The problem comes when certain ideologically oriented people dishonestly try to justify acts of minority discrimination as arising from historical reasons (slavery, segregation, etc) while trivially shunning majority discrimination as based on racial supremism, nazism and what not. They want to level the playing field for all, by ""explaining away"" certain forms of minority discrimination as having legitimate reasons, while chastizing only discriminators from majority community. The end effect is that it builds up an unhealthy frustration in the majority community, which forces itself in the forms of extremism sooner or later.

BTW, has anyone ever realized that its possible to even discuss issues of race & religion in ONLY democratic, multi-ethnic societies ?

Very few countries in the world are genuinely multi-ethnic and religiously diverse as US and India are. India is perhaps even more diverse than US owing to her great linguistic diversity. And that is probably why people from these two societies cry out the loudest about religious/ethnic discrimination and oppression.
Because they are free to do so. They are democracies with freedom of speach and expression are enshrined in their constitution.

Afterall :

Can you make movies showcasing the racism involved against non-muslims in Saudi Arabia ?

Can you complain about censorship and organize anti-government rallies in China ?

Can you write articles against Vladimir Putin in Russia and not be jailed ?

And yet, inspite of their inherent oppressive societies, they donot face as much flak about their societies as democratic societies do.

Movies like Crash only make democratic societies look bad, by show-casing only the ugly side. Even if a couple of such movies are turned out by hollywood and rewarded with best oscars every year, people around the world would get a seriously wrong impression about the nature and character of American society.

The truth remains that democratic societies are moving toward assimilation and dialogue. They are already better than most of their counterparts, even though they are not immune from prejudice-free environments. Sooner or later, they'll achieve that harmony and balance. Non-democratic and homogenous ones cannot achieve that balance as their authoritarians systems prohibit open dialogues between different communities.

Situation in both US and India is much better than in majority of the known world. Some interesting facts to give a dose of reality to some of you, who probably are too influenced by propaganda from extreme left. Did you know that :

--> The standard of living of American blacks, as a whole community, is higher than that of Swedes ? Nearly 70% of black community doesnt belong in Ghettos, but leads normal middle/upper middle class lives ?

--> Over 25% of the entire black male adult population in US cohabitates and/or marries White females and over 500,000 Asian females inter-marry with white men each year ? This trend of racial inter-marriage has been growing unabated in United States in the past 2 decades, and only seems to increase. If American society is indeed as racistic as this movie portrays, how is this even possible that millions of Americans have inter-racial marriages each year ?

--> According to Amnesty international, blacks are subject to greater job-related and social discrimination in Switzerland, and eastern europe than in USA ? An average black person can experience hate glances and crude remarks with a greater probability in Zurich or Moscow than in backwater Alabama ?

--> Persian Americans are the most educationally accomplished of all recent immigration communities in USA ? Over 80% of them hold university degrees.

--> Indian Americans are the richest ethnic group in USA, next are Greeks and third are Jews ?

--> That India, inspite of its history of caste/religious tensions is the ONLY country in the entire world run entirely by its different minority communities. The Indian president is a MUSLIM, the prime minister and chief of Army staff are both SIKHs. How many non-multiethnic, non-democratic countries would allow their religious/racial minorities to run their countries ? Would China ever allow an Uighur or Manchu to be their president ? Would Saudi Arabia or Pakistan allow a Hindu to rule over them ? Impossible.

Democratic societies don't need to feel guilty about the direction of their societies. It'll all settle down if more people concentrated on solutions rather than exploiting the problems and making unfair, guilt-ridden statements about their own societies, mostly based on extrapolations.

I just hope the movie makers had realized that the key to harmonious societal existence is BALANCE and STABILITY in inter-racial, inter-religious relationships, which cannot be achieved by a blame game..... before making this movie.",1142208000,12,6189,5.265243902439025

2359240,1,B000A3XY5A,"A review that pretty much sum up what I think of Crash

The Oscar for Crash might be Paul Haggis' reward for the citizen's worry of racial prejudice and interpersonal violence in L.A. If it was an award for nice intentions, then everything would be ok. But as a reward for the quality of a film, this year's Oscar is just plain hilarious.
Crash is Mr. Chips' bombastic lesson that proclaims, from high above, its vision -terrified in the beggining and appeased later- of good and evil, falling and redemption, forgiveness, the angel and the evil that coexist in each of the people living in L.A.

The writer and director Paul Haggis has talent as a preacher, but his first film is a round of estereotypes, arbitrary turns, summary characterizations, incredible coincidences and situations of melodrama that come and go as portraits of the racial tensions in the big city.

Haggis is also the Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' screenwriter. What a difference!. The writer Haggis doesn't have here a filmaker that keeps quite his demonstrative eagernes, preaching and willing of keeping the tone for the movie in a constant pathetism register. The director Haggis doesn't come against the writer Haggis. The result is a movie that wants to be as open as life itself, but in where there's no space for relaxing, intimacy, silence, humor or the trivial things of life. In Crash, every single situation is a climax, each dialogue is preaching and each character is an emblem.
In the first act of Crash, white people is 24/7 white people and the only thing they do is going around being racist. Black people do the same but according to their condition.

In the second act, after an improbable succession of plot turns and unbelievable coincidences, the white and black representative people, as well as the persian, latin, chinese and italian american people, the people that practice this racial prejudice between them, find their redemption and begin taking concience. The bad people become good and the good find out they can also be bad, and all this bunch of blaming and redemption is blessed with the snow falling in Los Angels.

Yes, THERE IS SNOW. If we saw frogs raining in 'Magnolia' and an earthquake in Altman's 'Shortcuts', why wouldn't Haggis give his film an special christmas touch to his instructuve redemption tale?

The second half of the movie moves between the ridiculous and absurd. Haggis wants his characters to transform in the way of the movie and to get out of their initial characterizing. With a trapeze-artist maneuversm he makes them make piruettes and turn their backs to what they were, without even caring of the internal process of them.

In an unbelievable succession of coincidences, the huge L.A. becomes a children's park where everyone comes across. The characters go back and forth, and then Matt Dillon, the bad racist and corrupt cop becomes a hero saving a black girl (which he molested before in the movie) from death. The car crash scene is shameless in its willing to manipulate emotions and create pathetism with the music and de-acelerating time and images. As if it wasn't enoiugh, then we see Dillon, the prepotent, transformd in his father's disease guardian.

The ending of the story between the irani and the latin is even more shamless. The poor latin is the object of every single distrust and racial prejudice, but Haggis makes him look almost as the pope. He cares and sacritifes for a girl that almost dies of a lost bullet. To protect her of any evil, he gives her an invisible bulletproof vest. And of course, minutes later, the girl will defeat her fear and goes against a real thread with her magical vest. In the attack scene, Haggis goes for the manual of the emotional sensationalism: slow motion camera, climax music, dramatic efectism of the shot and the fake ""miracle"". The scene is shameful and its realistic finish is even more, with the image of the fake bullets that devaluate the girl's and the person's faith.

But Sandra Bullock's character is the worst of the bunch. Beleiving she's a temperamental Meryl Streep, Sandra, paranoic and racist, gives us a telephone dialogue full of concept about anger, rage, pain and urban alienation. Haggis' punishment for the accumulated hate: she hungs up, she silps of the stairs. And she's saved by the latin maid that she understimated before. Later she hugs her and recognizes her. With 30 more minutes of length, Crash would've end up with every character going to heaven.

Crash is what is known as a high concept movie, which means it takes the main ideas of oher movites and constructs its own principal dramatic lines from them. It's a sort of remake of 'Shortcuts', 'Grand Canyon', 'Magnolia', 'House of Sand and Fog', among others. The Academy that didn't award 'Shortcuts', the best of the bunch, now awards an artificial and derivative movie. If it isn't the worst of the year, Crash sure is the most pretentious and overrated one.",1142121600,35,4951,4.869358669833729
2359241,5,B000A3XY5A,"As a writer, I won't even begin to try to explain the intricate plot of this movie. This a movie that is best left seen than explained because for about two hours, Crash will place you on the edge of your seat emotionally and won't let go. That's because finally Hollywood has made a movie that makes you actually forget who's in it. You are provided with such an intriguing set of stories that shine brighter than the star power of the stars themselves. What makes this movie that much more powerful is that it forces you to confront your own personal demons, even at the risk of finding someone in the movie is a mirror reflection you and you may not like what you see. At the same time, this movie also provides a sharp dose of reality that should spark conversation about racism and prejudices for years to come. Even then, despite all the star power that is packed into this movie, two stars stand out for me. I dare you though not to be mesmerized by the performances of Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. These two stars are like a an accident that you won't be able to turn your head from even though you know there are casualties. Is the Crash the best movie ever made, maybe not, but it definitely is the best picture of the year and one that should be apart of your collection.",1142121600,7,1285,4.33609958506224
2359242,5,B000A3XY5A,"Academy Awards Show(2006)received a low rate in audience but not in the quality of the movies.  Maybe these times we are living of political and social turmoil have experimented the appearance of great directors and new topics (a new way of moviemaking also).  Influenced by the great European directors still alive in the '70's, the best movies of today includes: 21 Grams, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby...

Crash is, maybe, one of those movies.  Based upon a structure of small spots similar to some of  Spain's Luis Bu?uel movies, and with characters and situations taken maybe from television soap operas and series, it presents the stories of people who run in pairs: a married couple linked to the government, two carjackers, a racist policeman and his partner, a tv movie director and his wife.  All set in the city of Los Angeles like in Michael Mann's Collateral, a movie who can be read in counterpoint with this one: the metaphor of the car, the inclusion of Hispanic culture, even the presence of African-American characters and actors who did an excellent work.

Don Cheadle face expressions are amazing(I love the man!) and  Matt Dillon (so underrated) should have won the Best Supporting Actor category.

2359244,1,B000A3XY5A,"I admire Crash for trying to tackle a tough issue like racism.  I feel that more movies should try and take on such social issues.  But Crash does so in such an unrealistic and untruthful way that it is impossible to take seriously or learn anything from.

Below is part of Erik Lundegaard's article for msnbc.com.  I obviously did not write it, but I agree with it 100% and could not have said it better myself:

This is the worst best picture winner since ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" in 1952. It may be worse than that. ""Greatest Show"" was a dull, bloated romance set against the backdrop of a three-ring circus but at least it didn't pretend to be important. ""Crash"" thinks it's important. ""Crash"" thinks it's saying something bold about racism in America.

But what is it saying?

That we all bear some form of racism. That we all ""stereotype"" other races. That, when pressured, racist sentiments spill out of us as easily as escaped air.

Here's my take. Yes, we all bear some form of racism - that's obvious. Yes, we all ""stereotype"" other races in some fashion - that's obvious. (Particularly obvious in the Los Angeles of ""Crash,"" where so many characters are stereotypes.) But, no, we don't easily give voice to our racist sentiments. And that's why ""Crash"" rings so false.

Last month I wrote an article on the best picture nominees (called  ""Anything But `Crash'"") in which I talked about how the most potent form of racism in this country is no longer overt but covert. Once upon a time, yes yes yes, it was overt, which is another reason why ""Crash"" sucks. It's doing what simple-minded generals do: It's fighting the last war.

The ""Crash"" quiz

Here, let's take a little quiz. Say you're an Asian woman who has just rear-ended the car in front of you. What do you do? Do you...

Wait in your car until a police officer arrives

Exchange licenses with the driver of the other car

Notice that the driver of the other car is someone who looks like Jennifer Esposito, immediately assume she's Mexican-American (as opposed to, say, Italian-American), and then tell the African-American police officer that ""Mexicans no know how to drive.""

How about this one? You're talking to a bureaucrat on the phone about getting extra care for your father who is having trouble urinating, and she is not helpful. You ask for her name and she tells you: Shaniqua Johnson. You still need her help. What do you say?

""Shaniqua. That's a beautiful name.""

""Shaniqua. You could do a better job of helping my father, who is in pain.

""Shaniqua. Big f---ing surprise that is.""

One last one. You've just been told by your hot, hot girlfriend, with whom you're lucky to be sleeping in the first place, that she is not Mexican as you presumed; that her mother is from Puerto Rico and her father is from El Salvador. What do you say?

""I'm sorry, honey. I'm surprised I didn't know that. Now come back to bed.""

""Really? How did they meet?""

""Who took [all Latinos] and taught them to park their cars on their lawns?""

And on and on and on. Every scene. Put a little pressure on somebody and they blurt simplistic racist sentiments. Right in the face of someone of that race.

Worse, none of it feels like sentiments these characters would actually say. It feels like sentiments writer/director Paul Haggis imposed upon them to make his grand, dull point about racism, when a more telling point about racism might have emerged if he'd just let them be. ""Crash"" is like a Creative Writing 101 demonstration of what not to do as a writer. To the Academy this meant two things: Best screenplay and best picture.

The Sandra Bullock/Ludacris scene

A few readers objected to my column last month - and will no doubt object to this one. They felt ""Crash"" taught them something important about race. More's the pity. They said they learned that even good people do bad things, and even bad people have moments of compassion. Sorry they didn't already know this. They felt like ""Crash"" was a movie the average person could support. ""Average,"" I guess, is the key word here.

Some agreed with me that the most potent form of racism today is covert rather than overt; but they added that this was a movie, after all, not a book, and in a movie you can't show characters thinking.

Ah, but you can. Paul Haggis even did it in ""Crash"" - in the scene where Sandra Bullock's character grabs her husband's arm as two black men approach. Her move toward her husband is silent and instinctive, and Ludacris' character suspects she does what she does because he's black, and she's scared of him, but he has no evidence. We only get the evidence later, from her, when she argues with her husband about the Latino locksmith. And even this scene is handled ineptly. She should have argued with her husband upstairs, away from the help. But Haggis wanted her to complain about the Latino locksmith within earshot of the Latino locksmith - because apparently that's how we all do it. Lord knows if I don't trust someone because of their race and/or class I raise my objection within earshot of them. Doesn't everyone?

The main point is that you can dramatize our more covert forms of racism. But here's how bad ""Crash"" is. Even though the Bullock/Ludacris scene is one of the more realistic scenes in the movie, it is still monumentally simplistic. I have a white female friend who lives close to the downtown area of her city. Usually she walks home from downtown. If she does this after dark, and two men are walking towards her, she'll cross to the other side of the street to avoid them. But if the two men are black? She won't do this, because she's afraid of appearing racist. That's how much of a conundrum race is in this country. ""Crash"" didn't begin to scratch that surface.

Losing Jim

So why did it win?

There are rumors that older Academy members shied away from even viewing ""Brokeback Mountain"" for the usual homophobic reasons. Lionsgate also pushed ""Crash"" on Academy voters; it handed out a record number of DVDs and advertised heavily. I don't know which explanation bothers me more. All I know is I feel sick. It feels like the '72 Olympic basketball finals, when the Russians cheated and won; it feels like the '85 World Series when a blown call in game six tilted the balance towards the Royals. It feels like the good guys wuz robbed.

My friend Jim is more interested in the Academy than anyone I know who isn't involved in the industry. (He's a chauffeur in Seattle.) By early summer he's already talking up possible nominees. The discussion reaches a fever pitch in November and December when the prestige pictures are rolled out and critics make their ""best of"" announcements. He goes to see these films. He talks about them. He actually cares.

Not anymore.

""Crash's"" win did him in. The Academy, he said afterwards, ""is not a serious body of voters who vote rationally. If they're influenced by a DVD sales pitch, they're not worth my time.""

Are they worth anyone's time? Once again, they showed themselves susceptible to something other than a legitimate search for ""the best."" Once again, marketing appears to have won. The Academy is 78 years old and acting every bit of it, and last night they took another doddering step towards irrelevancy.",1142121600,73,7249,4.65282131661442
2359245,2,B000A3XY5A,"I learned from CRASH, the special two disc widescreen dvd, that Los Angeles is a cartoonishly racist place to live.  People spout off bigoted and evil nonsense, and then, ironically, some of them turn out to be justified!  I also learned that good communication skills are vital when trying to speak to a shopkeeper whose lock you are trying to fix.  If it turns out that he needs a whole new door, but you've replaced his lock anyway, actually taking him over to show him the new lock you've installed and how he still may want to replace his door could avoid a long and pointless screaming match.  Visual aides always help.

  I learned that spending a lot of camera time focused on a 60 year old man trying unsuccessfully to make wee-wee in a closet-sized bathroom causes a viewer to squint and look away, eventually to become involved in picking at his or her fingernails.

  There was a very pleasant scene between a father and his 5 year old daughter in which he gave her what he claimed was an invisible bullet deflecting cloak that was given to him by a fairy.  I thought that was good, because then the movie would have to kill one of them.  Either the dad, for irony's sake, or the child, so we could all be sad when she looked at her dad and said, ""But the fairy told you a bullet couldn't hurt me.""  I wondered if it would be pathos or irony?  Irony or pathos?  My tears were eager to flow, either way.

  I never found out, because after 51:03 into the film, I couldn't take anymore.  I'll try and get back to it later, to find out if there's any hope for Los Angeles and social justice.  In the meantime, I'm left looking at the second disc in my WideScreen Two Disc Deluxe Edition, and I'm wondering what could have been encoded on this bit of plastic instead of interviews with Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon?  The Magnificent Ambersons has yet to see DVD release.  A special edition of The Paradine Case?  It boggles the mind.

Far from being touched, I was completely irritated that a couple of white guys (Haggis and Moresco) were preaching to me about racism with all the authenticity and subtlety of a hammer (apparently the one referred to in Haggis's acceptance speech).

I appreciate the messages that this movie tries to bring out-that we are all connected in some way despite our color, that there are larger issues within each one of us that others don't know about-- but it seemingly fails miserably in its presentation of its issues. The main problem with this movie is that it tries way too hard to push the racism issue over and over again to the point of nausea. This isn't a film that lets you decide on your own about anything: it beats you over the head with it, and, just to make sure, hits you again.

Watching the movie, there was one thought that continued to come into my mind: Could a movie be more stereotypical or prototyped? All the characters have some racism agenda on their minds or in their lives. We have the two thugs who don't believe they have been given a chance in society. We have the white racist cop. We have the two white yuppie-wannabes. We have the foreign store clerk. Can this movie pick out a few more stereotypes to throw at us?

There are so many issues that irked me about this film. I know that we should not take everything we see at face-value in a film, but this film was so overtly blunt and forceful about it's theme of racism that it really got quite annoying. There literally is no shred of subtleness in this film: we know exactly what the characters seemingly are about. Another annoyance was the absolute preposterous circumstances and situations that seemingly arise again and again, namely the coincidence of the white racist cop (Matt Dillon) saving the black woman who he just happened to abuse the night earlier during a traffic stop.

The characters were so one-dimensional it is hard to comprehend how this film received so many accolades. For the record, Sandra Bullock's character was one of the most nauseating characters I've seen in a while.

I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculousness of it all. Then again, Hollywood seemingly has a knack for this.

The biggest problem is that this movie got the big prize, the picture of the year. If it hadn't been nominated, maybe it could have a sleeper that everyone got behind and talked about. As it is, this film is quite overrated, and one of the weakest pictures of the year in recent memory.

Yes, the acting is fine; yes, the intercutting between characters works; yes, some of the dialogue is entertaining (e.g. when the hijack duo banter about hockey and the Staples Center) but it's all using a sledgehammer and stock characters and emotions to make the point -- again and again and again -- that racism is alive and well in the 21st century.  This is news?

Jon Stewart jibed that Hollywood is out of touch.  Despite George Clooney's riposte, Crash and its Oscar validates Stewart's point -- the Academy awards itself for bravely discovering what is old news to every other sentient being, implying in the moralizing that Hollywood itself is different.

I didn't care about the ""racial message"" the movie had for its moviegoers.  I realized that the characters were racist but they weren't any more racist than any people I come in contact with everyday.  Apparently I wasn't the only person that loved the movie.  I looked around and saw tons of good reviews for the movie.

Then came Brokeback Mountain.

Everyone went crazy for Brokeback Mountain.  Was it a good movie?  Sure.  I liked it but I liked Crash more.  Suddenly everyone that had loved Crash before were now calling it some ""liberal brainwashing for the masses"" and that it ""told everyone that they were dirty little racists"".  I thought the movie wasn't saying anything new so the thought of it being some profound statement against racism never crossed my mind.  But now, everyone hated the movie.  It was cool to love Brokeback Mountain and hate Crash with every fiber of your being.

Then Crash won Best Picture at the Oscars.

I think, it was deserved.  All of the movies nominated were great, of course, but I think Crash was the best out of them.  It wasn't a more ""profound"" statement, it was just a better movie.  It was a better movie than Brokeback Mountain and I think the people that originally loved Crash just hopped on the Brokeback Mountain bandwagon because it was trendy to hate Crash for being liberal agenda and love Brokeback Mountain because it was about two gay cowboys.  People started judging the movies on their ""messages"" and not their quality.  I think that was the reason that it was such an upset that Crash won.  Everyone felt the movie was Hollywood telling everyone that they're bad little racists and Brokeback Mountain was groundbreaking as a movie about two gay main characters.  I think when you look at the merits of the movies themselves, Crash is the better made film.

It keeps repeating the same points as if too just make sure that you get the movie is talking about Racism. Okay, so he molests the black chick, that's awful and wrong. His father is sick, so I sympathize for him. He goes too the receptionist, who just HAPPENS too be black and there is a quarrel there. Oh, but no, just in case you don't get it, lets throw her in a burning car and HE has too save her. By the end of that story line, I didn't even really care. Ontop of that, there are 3 other stories (if I remembere correctly, it might be 4) go on dealing with different aspects of racism as well. Now, maybe a subtle movie isn't for everyone, I get that. What bugs me though was that after the movie we watched the making of. Everyone was praising it for being this new bold statement, and the writer Paul Haggis gloating over how his storylines suprised you how they twisted, even though we ALL know it wasn't. It's just him being pompous and freaking jerk.

However, this movie does have some plusses. The acting is fantastic (other then Sandra Bullock, but she isn't in long enough too really matter) and the cinimatography was superb. This movie was SO close too being so good, but with a script based on obvious plots that you can see the end of, despite the fact that there are 4-5 4-5 storylines going on. Very few surprises, and in the end just very over-rated. Haggis is a great director, but he needs to stop writting if he keeps writting drivel like this. It thinks it's being bold, sadly though, it seems like it tricked a lot of people into making this movie the best movie of 2005, but I won't get into that...",1141948800,9,2206,4.328502415458937
2359252,5,B000A3XY5A,"In the Film ""Crash"", movie viewers are challenged to remain ambivalent while following the life line of a city afloat in a sea of racial tensions. The story begins with a touching philosophical summery of modern life in a large metropolis of America. Don Cheadle, in what is likely to become a classic role for him, gives a most inspiring performance as a Los Angeles policeman in search of meaning. In his role as an investigative officer , he searches for the murderer of his brother and a victim of a gunshot shooting. While he makes his rounds of the city, he attempts to hold his family together while all around him, other people are struggling with theirs. Each life is laced with personal stereotypical barriers which prompts others to collide with them. Each suffers through their own brand of racial bigotry and in turn allows the viewer to see themselves in this fascinating mirror of life. This is drama at it's best.  Memorable performances from Matt Ryan, Billy Gallo, and Ryan Phillippe as Hanson, highlight this amazing collection of stories.

I will be honest and serious on my comments about Crash.
I have seen it last summer and bought the DVD last year as well as the soundtrack by Mark Isham.
Paul Haggis is an interesting person - he must be - just because he had written also Million Dollar Baby by one of my favourite directors, Clint Eastwood. So I was excited to saw this movie.
It's good and with some - not all - believable characters - fabulous Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton.
A good story line! Some interesting camera angles for a first movie experience from Paul Haggis. But I had seen ""this story"" in Theatres along the years: Lantana, Magnolia, The 24th Hour and so on...

But - really - this movie, although great, is not Art in Cinema. It shouldn't had won the Oscar for Best Picture. Crash is not the most significant movie of 2005.
Obviously, and for those who love cinema - I mean real love for the movies - KNOWS that Brokeback Mountain were the most obvious choice. It was so obvious that I just cannot believe it had lost that missing prize (the Only one!). It happens to be that Brokeback Mountain, just to remember, had won THE Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival, 4 Golden Globes, 4 BAFTAS, The Director's Guild of America among many others + 3 Oscars (same number as Crash) including Best Director (Crash misses it too!). You know, ALL of this meant something! Crash did not won none of the above listed prizes!

Art in filmmaking = Great directing. Period. Brokeback Mountain IS an unforgettable story ALSO brilliantly played by 3 Oscar nominees with a miraculous sensibility. What more can I say. I do not believe in people who say Crash is better than BM. Just don't. The Academy is more and more old. Sadly! And I think they will regret forever that Brokeback Mountain didn't won that only and missing prize. Though the movie lingers on in my heart.

Crash is a story from Los Angeles. The Oscars were given in Los Angeles. And the movie ends with an almost ""hollywood ending"". Everything was correct and explained to the viewer. Why?

Crash won Best Picture just because of the old fashioned prejudice from the ""Academy"". I really thought it was extinguish! Yes! How fool am I! The ""Academy"" MUST BE - SHOULD BE ahead of its time. But it's not! For my part I quit seeing the Oscars.",1141948800,10,2313,4.497619047619048

Rarely have I seen a film handle the issue of racism so clumsily an didactically, and what stuns me even more is that people are actually buying into the ugly, facile stereotypes employed by the screenplay. Paul Haggis' attempt at creating a mosaic of interlocking vignettes fails on fronts, chiefly because the director has little understanding of how people interact. Instead of drawing out subtle communications between the multi-ethnic characters, he goes right for the jugular with laughably overwrought demonstrations of how blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians are all oh-so mean to each other. I've seen Sesame Street episodes with more nuance (and better acting, too, but that's a whole different issue). CRASH panders to the mainstream audience with its reductive portrayal of race relations, and makes no apologies for its ludcrious plot contrivances and overly-tidy characterizations. The fact that members of the Academy thought this was the best film of 2005 is stunning and disgusting on just about every conceivable level.

Not all the fine acting, gritty cinematography, nimble editing and moody music score can hide the fact that Paul Haggis' screenplay fails to deliver as convincing drama. His writing is manipulative and he gives his fine acting ensemble rants and speeches instead of believable dialogue. This supposedly ""modern day parable"" on race relations in L.A. takes a disastrously wrong step early in the film (when  two young black men decide to hi-jack a wealthy white couple's SUV) and the picture never recovers from then on.

""Crash"" obviously has its supporters and there are some people who, while not liking the film, have labeled it as well intentioned, despite the clumsy storytelling.

2359281,3,B000A3XY5A,"I will admit right off to my bias. I loved Brokeback, and have seen it several times. I am gay and wanted it to win. I would rather see a so-so movie about something I am interested in than an outstanding movie about something I am not. And I think most people (movie critics included, except Roger Ebert who has the unique ability to move outside his own biases, even if I frequently disagree with his conclusions) are pretty much the same way. I have sat thru some pretty mediocre movies just because there was a gay romance in it. But Brokeback Mountain is one of the very best gay subject movies I have ever seen, despite some notable flaws.

With that said, I tired as hard as possible to be objective about Crash. But I found it to be heavy handed, contrived, and drawn in broad stereotypical strokes. It played like one of the better TV dramas. Actually, it seemed more like a diversity training film than a real movie: ""In this section we see how Asians are often perceived as...."" or ""This is what African Americans have to deal with when confronted by city police..."" We have heard it all before, it is not entertaining or fresh. I felt like i was being bludgeoned with the admonishment ""Racism! It's racism! Everything was so obvious and laden with artifice. It just didn't ring true or engaging for me at all. Just about every single line and plot point in this movie is racially motivated. Do these characters do anything else? After about a half hour of this I wanted to scream ""Make it Stop!"" Certainly the issues raised in Crash are extremely important, but this movie is just overdone and without finesse.

On the plus side, there is fine acting and some interesting characters, and the movie is well put together, although nothing struck me as being terribly out of the ordinary.

I can only conclude that the Academy was either homophobic, was suffering from Brokeback fatigue, wanted to reward a home town movie, or maybe resented being dictated to about who the winner should be. Also Oscar often parcels out the major awards to several of the leading most deserving movies. That certainly happened this year.

Most likely reason: the heavy marketing strategy of the producers of Crash. It may not have occurred to everyone that not every Academy member sees every movie. It is almost like a political campaign. And i do think some of the more conservative members refused to see Brokeback Mountain. In the end, these awards don't mean a whole lot.

I am not one to play the ""we were robbed"" card, but when a movie has swept thru so many previous awards, and got such an overwhelming critical response (more than Crash), wins 3 Oscars, and then loses Best Picture, you have to wonder why.

It was clear from the start that this movie would be sappy and cliche-filled: 'we crash into each other in order to make contact.' Anybody who would believe such a premise does not live in Southern California - let alone Los Angeles. The opposite is actually closer to the truth. CRASH quite simply spotlights this behavior and is a reminder of why we act as we do.

According to CRASH, we have justification for all our prejudice and hate for one another (and according to these movie-makers we all have them). After watching CRASH, one can believe that every stereotypical, hate and fear-based feeling we have is A-Okay:

Afraid of black guys walking down the street - you have every reason.

Think that a white can't hire a non-white without getting ripped off - you're right.

Believe that black people hate white people as much as whites hate blacks - it's not just your imagination (running away with you).

Think Asians shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a vehicle - here's your proof.

Middle-Eastern, Puerto Rican, and Mexican people are in their somewhere too, however they get lost in these confusing, go-nowhere and misdirected collection of video clips.

Many scenes start off hot and quickly fizzle out leaving the viewer wondering if the story will be continued in another segment or just plain didn't get the message.

The most unfortunate aspect of this movie was the waste of such a great cast. These very talented people found themselves in the middle of a muddle.

Most did very well with what little they had to work with, which earned CRASH the three stars instead of one.

The stand-out performers who deserve mention:

Terence Howard and Michael Pena are both brilliant. Hopefully we will see much more of these truly great actors.

Sandra Bullock gives one of her best 'against-type' performances.

Luducris is impressive and shows great potential for even more.

If CRASH is such a profound insight of a cross-section of human nature in Los Angeles,...ask yourself why the creators did not include any gay characters in their vast line-up. It's LA, where's the reality in that?

One probable answer: cross-country ticket sales. We can watch a scene (with very little left to the imagination) featuring interracial, mixed-gender lovers with no problem, yet if same-gender characters simply embrace, we squirm in our seats and condemn the movie to anyone who will listen (or read). We can dish it out, but cannot take it.

' CRASH had all the potential to make real statements - but it simply fell short and took the safe route. CRASH played the Hollywood political game and stuck with the Hollywood cliche: Give 'em what they like, tell 'em what the already know, leave 'em believing they're feelings are justified...and by no means upset any group that can create a negative backlash and hurt the bottom line.

2359285,4,B000A3XY5A,"I saw Crash last evening at a free screening at my local public library. The event was previously scheduled as part of the ongoing observance of Black History Month (yes, they admitted the official month is already over), long before it won the Best Picture Oscar.

As other reviewers have observed, it's impossible in the current climate to talk only about this film, and not make comparisons.

The craftsmanship (including the acting) in making this film is first-rate, and this is part of what gives it so much impact. And I believe we all have a moral duty to look at things that discomfort and disturb us. There can even be a subtle epicurean pleasure in doing so. Crash draws you in, makes you think, and leaves an enduring impression. These are the hallmarks of an excellent film, for me.

At the same time, the film is extremely bleak. It offers scant hope, and almost no sympathetic characters. Even that subtle epicurean pleasure I spoke of was missing for me, and that's why I deny it the fifth star.

There are a few things that bother me (aside from the film's message that we are enmeshed in a web of bigotry and violence).

The film hangs together only because a matrix of not-truly-believable coincidences. The attempts at closure near the end also are not truly believable for me. And there are events in the film (I won't say which, for those who have yet to see it) that wrench the emotions yet fail to carry through to the outcome we know would ensue in real life. These Hollywood touches don't ring true. All the same, I acknowledge that this is a motion picture, a work of fiction, and not a documentary. And to be fair, not everything in Brokeback Mountain rang completely true for me, either.

Of the five Best Picture nominees, I have seen only Crash and Brokeback Mountain. My girlfriend has seen the others, so I know of them, though only second-hand. Having admitted that, I'm puzzled why the Academy members chose this film not only over Brokeback Mountain, but the other nominees.

My suspicion -- and it cannot be more than this -- is that Crash portrays the reality that Academy members *fear* exists outside the walls of their compounds. If this is the case, then not the film itself, but the Academy's anointing of it, would represent a kind of subtle racism.

I might be wrong, but if I am right, this too should be faced and acknowledged.

2359299,4,B000A3XY5A,"Separate stories develop, then careen out of control & intersect in different & amazing ways. Far too many characters to explore in a brief review. The most compelling for me was Matt Dillon, playing a veteran, racist cop. But their are no  absolutes in this movie & even a character that starts out  loathsome, has redeeming qualities. Blacks, whites, upper & lower class have many of the same interpersonal relationship problems. We are the same under the skin. Ah, the skin. The whole movie is washed with the thin veneer of the racism that still prevades this country, especially in law enforcement. Very little to smile about in this sometimes grim but always interesting movie. An important work.

The Oscar win was providential in that many more people will now be exposed to Crash, if for no other reason that it was the winner. Kind of went under the radar while Broke-Back Mountain, the favorite, & an excellent by the way, was  out there everyday.

One group of them are bigots and complacent suburban right wingers. These people are either too obtuse to understand the message of this movie. They see only other whites portrayed as racists in this movie, ignoring the African-American, Latino and East Asian racism. They see a white cop shown as an abusive creep manhandling a black girl on the street but ignore the way the movie shows him breaking down under the weight of his dad's impending death and one of the reasons he is lashing out at African-Americans is because in some way he holds them partially responsible for his problems. They ignore how the movie has this cop later goes beyond the call of duty when he encounters this black girl again in a car accident, heroically he rescues her from being burned alive.

The other group of haters for this movie are a bunch of gay men, pink with anger (yes...the pun was intended) because their precious ""Bareback Mounting"" Oops! I mean ""Brokeback Mountain"" didn't win the Oscar. These people must have nothing better to do. Is ""Will & Grace"" in rerun season or something? Aren't there some House music or disco club comps they should be buying or something?

2359301,5,B000A3XY5A,"These are basically the four primordial elements which integrate an intelligent and absorbing. The detailed process of several psychological profiles which concur in L.A. are narrated with an impeccable edition work and engaging stories.

Supported by a visible documental style and forceful visual images, the anecdotic feature is however its main virtue and not necessarily a flattening proof of originality and creativeness.

To my mind there are four previous films that portrait with all the possible crudeness, this painful reality.

In what formal construction and narrative style concerns, Robert Altman was the pioneer with ""Short Cuts""; on the other hand there is French film of Mathieu Kassovitz ""The hate"" which focuses on parallel issues; there is another forgotten and underrated film of Dennis Hopper : ""Colors"" , the superb ""21 grams"" and finally we should not forget the admirable and absorbing work of Spike Lee ""Do the right thing"".

In this sense Crash prized as Best Film retains this bitter taste and seemed to turn around the circular nightmares and the absence of possible redemption. Its opened ending reflects and reveals with powerful strength the perpetual dynamic of the cyclic human condition.

This is a good symptom to take into account, because fortunately the special effects seem to have achieved the majestic peak (Lord of the rings) and returning to what it may constitute an authentic inner gaze, where the author `s cinema would seem to be recovering its missed dignity.

In last instance, if we take a look over the last seven years around films of  emblematic status such as American beauty, Mystic River, The hours, Lost in translation, The believer and 21 grams would seem to support my opinion.

I'm sorry that I can't go into more detail...but I do recommend that you watch it at least once before you leave this world.

The subtleties of the actors in this movie really blew me away; this is the first time Sandra Bullock has done ANYTHING to move me!

2359304,4,B000A3XY5A,"Roger Ebert said that Crash should win because it will be remembered more than films like Brokeback Mountain. Although  I liked Crash, I have to disagree. There's a lot of other films that made me say ""wow, I'm watching the best movie of the year"". Hell I got that vibe while watching Walk the Line, not Crash. Crash basically just shows people showing their bad sides and then has them showing their good sides. I guess it's point is that  if people showed their good sides more then their bad, the world would be a better place.

  It has a great cast with Matt Dillion giving a great performance as a cop who takes out his problems with his sick dad on black people. Although he's excellent, I didn't really see the oscar potential there. I would've rather have seen Mickey Rourke get a deserved nomination for Sin City instead. Just like with everyone else in the film, we see his bad side and then his good side. The film basically just does that with every character. The scenes I think that work  the most is the spanish locksmiths' scenes with his daughter. He's a good guy always showing that he's a good guy and his last scene with his daughter is bound to make you cry. It's the most moving thing the film has going for it. Other than that I think the 1992 film Grand Canyon is a better film about prejudice and how the world would be better if we got along. Yet I don't think that was nominated for anything.... I don't really see how it will be remembered more than Brokeback Mountain like Ebert said either. Crash doesn't make as much of an impact on you as Ebert acts like it does. Everyone knows there's problems in the world without seeing this movie. While Brokeback Mountain could make people think ""hey to each his own, if they wanna be together, why not ?"" lol.

One example of such bigotry shown in the film is the making fun of how Chinese speak English.  My wife is Chinese and I sometimes poke fun at her inability to pronounce words like ""brocoli."" I thought I loved my wife but thank you Hollywood for letting me know that I actually am bigoted and racist against her. GO BACK TO CHINA, HONEY!

I wish the makers of this film could see how my wife, her Chinese friends and Chinese relatives laugh out loud when I try to speak Mandarin.  It isn't because they are hate-mongering bigots. It is for the same reason we sometimes laugh at their English: Mispronounciations can be funny.

The maker of this film, Paul Haggis, seems to think that he is quite high and mighty as to be an arbiter of the bigoted ""little people,"" lower than himself. He has contrived characters who act as his puppets in a polemic on the racism that he thinks infects all those of us who have not reached his supreme level of consciousness. Haggis, who hails from my native Canada, is the kind of dour, doctrinaire, left-wing automaton that dominate Hollywood and Academia. They claim to promote ""tolerance"" despite being fanatically intolerant towards anyone who acts, speaks or thinks in a manner they disapprove of.

2359317,5,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH was an ambitious project which far exceeded my expectations. CRASH is not simply a movie dealing with ""racism."" Instead, it is a complex and multi-faceted reflection on multicultural urban America.

First, we see a wonderful ensemble cast coursing through Los Angeles isolating themselves from all but those most closest to them. Going from house to car and back again, they ignore those who are different from them and could care less about their ignorance. It's easier and less work for them to rely on stereotypes and hypocrisy than to involve themselves with those they are forced to encounter as individuals.

Second, This is not a movie about white racism or black and white relations. Instead it deals with the bigotry and prejudices which exists within all ethnic groups. Whites have fear and contempt for blacks. Blacks have animosity for Asians. Asians look down on Westerners. Etc.

What makes this an exceptionally well made and acted movie is the way it treats the issue of racism and alienation. Nothing is simple, not even racism. Ludicrous and Lorenz Tate gripe about the way young black men are seen as thugs right before they carjack Sandra Bullock. Ryan Phillipe plays a cop who can no longer deal with his partner's (Matt Dillon) racist attitude which is escalating with the increased stress and pressure from having to cope with a dying father and lousy medical care. However, in the end it is the ""racist"" cop who risks his life to save a black woman (Thandie Newton), while the other cop, in a seperate scene, falls back upon latent prejudices and fears which he very self-righteously didn't think he had for the black man.

This is the kind of movie which forces you to confront the bigotry that is not only inside you but in that guy walking by you or standing next to you in line. It makes you realize the baggage we carry from childhood about everybody who looks differently from us and vice versa. Perhaps this is why CRASH is getting some hostile reaction from so many negative reviewers here. Many of their statements prove the movie's point.",1141776000,12,2078,4.812324929971989

Having said that, I have seen Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck (but not Munich...want to see that one too).

Someone on here encouraged viewers to ignore the negative comments from the 'sore losers.'

I'm not so sure those who have vented don't have a legitimate gripe. Generally I don't believe in making comments in a review section of one movie that don't pertain to that movie.  I'm making an exception here, however, due to the shock of Crash upsetting Brokeback, and the comments it has generated here.  Due to that Oscar event alone, I am allowing myself to add my 2 cents worth.

As I mentioned in my review under Brokeback Mountain....  Brokeback Mountain has won upwards of a dozen best picture awards (probably more)... everything from film festivals to major newspaper movie awards (NY Times, LA Times), etc..right up to the Golden Globes... even the British equivalent to the Oscar for best film.  It has won every single time except once.

Crash, on the other hand, has won only once.  ONCE!  I think it is reasonable to expect, that if Crash was really equal to, or better than Brokeback Mountain, it might have won a few more of those awards along the way.

Now add to that reports that many of the Academy voters didn't even want to see Brokeback because they didn't like the content, and tell me that their stated prejudice didn't play a part in the film that won all the awards losing to a film that had only won one.

Brokeback Mountain is a gem.  I may very well like Crash, but I am predicting that after I see it, I will still see the wisdom of all those other competitions handing Brokeback the Best Picture award.

Brokeback lost because of prejudice. As I said in my Brokeback review....  years from now, Brokeback will be the most remembered movie of 2005, and the only one that will be labeled a classic..",1141689600,9,2062,4.467914438502674

The end of the movie with the snow in L.A. is about as original as raining frogs. The cut scenes following a variety of characters throughout the film with quick jumps and them passing each other on the street and not even knowing it. What do you know?! Magnolia did that first, too. Dealing with the stark realities of race and drugs. Yeah, not so original, Crash. Following cops on their beat like COPS the T.V. show. Magnolia did it first, yep. Cheesey lines and bad plot ties . . . well Crash did that all on their own.

2359325,5,B000A3XY5A,"Let me please explain to you why the previous few reviewers should be discouraged, and rendered void...

1) The Acting is Superb.  Such a cast has never been assembled.  It has Don Cheadle (an academy Award Nominee) Tarence (spelling?) Howard (an academy Award Nominee) and Matt Dillon (an academy Award nominee).  Each of them are superb.  Each are masters of ttheir trade.  Their work is pure genius in this film.

2) This film is not bad just because it beat Brokeback Mountain.  The Academy did not pass on Brokeback because it was too controversial.  It passed because Crash was the better film.  Simple.  Robert Ebert agrees.  Richard Roeper Agrees.  I agree.  The academy agrees.  END OF STORY

3) The script is moving.  Paul Haggis is now 2 for 2 in the oscars for his screenplays.  Would the academy make the same mistake twice?

4) The score is wonderful.  Reflecting the dark tones and moods of the movie, the timbres of the music are a joyous celebration of the movie.  Perfect.

5) Not all white people are portrayed as racist.  Ryan Phillip's character is the most tolerant person in the movie.  Matt Dillon's character saves the life of a black woman.  Sandra Bullock overcomes her own stereotypes.  Oh, and everyone else in the movie is racist as well.  Finally, I will not qualify the points of someone who uses the phrase ""more better.""  A reviewer who does such is quite invalid.

2359326,4,B000A3XY5A,"3/07/06

Why am I not surprised to see all the (overly) venomous things being spewed out at this film just hours after its ""upset"" Oscar win?  I don't think any of the people who are saying things like ""I wanted to burn this film,"" felt quite that strongly in their dislike for this movie before Sunday night, and I'd also bet most of them would never have even bothered to write a review until this ""atrocity"" of a win occurred.  All of a sudden, though, this movie is the worst thing to happen to cinema since ""Howard the Duck.""

Well, besides the fact that many of you arguing such things can't even manage to write a coherent sentence to get your point across (""I did not saw this movie and I don't plan to,"" writes one reviewer; a) that is poor grammar and doesn't make much sense and b) what then are you doing writing a review?), the others that do have valid reasons could still stand to relax.  Only one movie a year can win best picture.  It won't always be the one you want.

The Oscars have disappointed me more times than I can count in the past:  How does ""Forrest Gump"" win over ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The English Patient"" over ""Fargo,"" ""Shakespeare in Love"" over ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Gladiator"" over ""Traffic,"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" over ""Mystic River?""  The fact is all the movies nominated usually deserve to be (and often many do that aren't, see ""A History of Violence"" this year), but only one can walk away with that gold man.  We all have our opinions on which film it should be. In the past 15 years or so I've only supported the wins for ""Unforgiven,"" ""Braveheart,"" and ""Million Dollar Baby.""  ""Forrest Gump"" is a fine film, and ""Lord of the Rings"" was amazingly conceived, but was ""Gump"" as groundbreakingly original and revitalizing to American cinema as ""Pulp Fiction?""  Was ""LOTR"" as emotionally draining and quietly haunting as ""Mystic River?""  The answer, no matter if you liked these films or not, is 'no.'  But the Academy voters saw it fit to award the other films.  At least in the case of ""Brokeback"" and ""Crash"" the two movies are worthy competitors, both dealing with tough topics and aspiring to be more than just movies (if they succeed or not is in the eye of the beholder), and a win for one over the other does not mean the Academy is out of touch and awarding the ""safer"" movie.  I knew on Monday morning I was going to hear all this crap about the Oscars being homophobes and not ready to deal with a movie as tough and liberal as ""Brokeback Mountain."" It's a cop out.  To lose to ""Crash"" is to lose to a movie about racism, violence and our personal demons; a movie that questions its characters true inner beliefs and feelings; if they really are the people they think they are. That hardly sounds to me like an Academy that is out of touch or afraid to recognize a movie that deals with controversial topics, just playing it safe.

Also; I am laughing my ass off at all you people who keep saying that you are done with the Oscars, this is the final nail in their coffin, and you now realize they are a joke and out of touch, etc.; what rock have you people been living under?  You're just fed up now?! I just listed ten years of Oscar misses!  And to the people who keep talking about ""Magnolia"" and other movies ""Crash"" ""ripped-off,"" hey, ""Speed"" is ""Die Hard"" on a bus - and still an excellent movie!  (And for the record:  ""Magnolia"" sucked!)

And to reviewer ""Moviebuff Layne,"" I respect your attempt to be somewhat fair and balanced in what you said here, noting you hadn't seen the film and comparing it to ""Brokeback"" on a technical, award-winning level, however, the fact remains you have not seen it, and you are exactly the kind of person I am referring to when I point out reviewers who are trying to turn their disappointment over their favorite movie losing into a witch hunt for prejudices against gays. You also shoot your self in the foot because you acknowledge in your ""Brokeback"" review the movie hit home for you because you are gay.  That hardly makes you fair and balanced in your view of the better film and by that logic, should a person who has been racially persecuted be able to bash Oscar as racist had ""Brokeback"" won?  And to say homophobia is a bigger issue than race in this country is a pretty radical statement.  I'm sure anyone who's experienced racism, as you may have experienced sexual persecution, would disagree.  You are the close-minded individual ""Crash"" was made for. You say you planned to see ""Crash;"" do so, and then give us your two cents.

I also think these issues and ideas are bigger than the issue of gay love.  If you want to be equal about gay love then, fine, we're just talking about a love story with ""Brokeback,"" a well-done, moving one, but a love story just the same.  If it would have been about two male and female cowboys would it have gained the same notoriety; or would the gay community embrace it as the best movie of the year?  Would we even be comparing these two movies?  ""Crash's"" issues are bigger than any love story, gay or straight, and the answer's are tougher.  It is the more complex, challenging film.  Not all of us are struggling with budding homosexuality, but we are all struggling with our own personal prejudices.  If you think you're not, then you probably are more than any one else.  And that is ""Crash's"" ultimate message.

That said; is ""Crash"" a well made film, does it have all the cheesy moments people have mentioned, are the performances good, is the dialog labored, are there better movies out there, etc?  Hey, it's all in the eye of the beholder.  Enough Academy voters obviously thought on a whole it was a special, meaningful and potent film.  But if you don't, that's fine.  But don't make the Academy out to be homophobes because the movie you liked better didn't win.

The one criticism I can not tolerate is that ""Crash"" is a racist movie.  I don't know where in the hell this idea came from, but only the most self-righteous person, who thinks they are bias free, and that any exploration of some possible truism stereotypes furthers racism can truly believe this.  I am a white male who truly hates the idea of being politically correct just for the sake of being politically correct.  And I think racism works both ways, and that all races are guilty of it, just as they are all guilty of many of the stereotypes they have been labeled with.  To the white people who think they are being preached to:  you just don't get it.  To the minorities that thinks it reinforces stereotypes:  The NAACP awarded ""Crash"" best movie of the year.  If any organization was going to sniff out a racist movie, they would have been it.  Not only did they not find it racist, they also called it the best movie of the year.  `Nuff said.

Maybe it's the hype that has some of you baffled as to this film's greatness.  I first saw this movie nearly a year ago with free passes to an advanced screening and wasn't expecting any thing and I was blown away.  To watch it grow and build its deserved audience was exciting and to watch the inevitable backlash build was depressing.

I guess what it comes down to is the quality of the film.  This review forum has turned into an Oscar point/counterpoint, but we should still remember to review the film on its own terms (hard as it may be now).  Forget the awards and the backlash.  Most movies are either overrated or underrated (had ""Brokeback"" won, we'd have the exact opposite sentiments on this page from people who felt ""Crash"" was robbed).  I'm not giving ""Crash"" 5 stars.  It is a great film full of great ideas.  It deserves more than just to call it a good movie and I definitely think people should see it (even if they don't like it), but, as one Amazon reviewer said, it makes you think but is not perfect. As much as it made me think, there are plenty of movies that affected me more and haunted me more deeply.  But that's like saying something is not a great movie - or the best of the year - because it doesn't stand up to the best of some other year.  Of this year's nominees, ""Crash"" was the right choice.

Oh, and lets stop calling it an upset.  I know ""Brokeback"" was predicted in most circles to win, but we are acting like ""Crash"" stole the award or something, as if it never had a chance.  I don't know how many top ten lists that I saw list ""Crash"" over ""Brokeback,"" and for as many critics that loved them, both films had an equal amount of detractors.  Those shocked by ""Crash's"" win just underestimated how close of a race this was.  Don't bitch cause you're expectations weren't met.  If anything, the Oscars, generally a predictable night (especially after months of award shows leading up to them) could use more surprises, upsets and close races.  Last year was something of a nail-biter for ""Aviator"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" fans (it's hard to recall now, but they won equal amounts of Awards, and ""Aviator"" took the Golden Globe), but somewhere along the line ""Baby"" gained momentum and pulled ahead (good).  The same thing happened this year.  Both years, the Oscars were better for it.",1141689600,,9104,4.490577507598784

2359341,1,B000A3XY5A,"This is the most preachy after-school special type film ever made. Every second is pounding racsim into your brain. The characters say things nobody in real life would say. The white characters are all evil villains. For example, Sandra Bullock plays a selfish white woman who falls down the stairs and is suddenly cured of her racism. What a joke! The dialogue in this film is some of the worst in history and Sandra Bullock's performance is a laughing stock.

Contrived plots and highly unlikely occurances all combine to make a total failure of a motion picture. This was named best picture at the Oscars just to keep the better movie Brokeback Mountain from winning. The conservative members of the academy couldn't deal with that film's subject matter so they named this best picture because everyone is against racism (or at least they pretend to be); however most people can agree to discriminate against gay people. It's very sad that America hasn't come any further in the struggle for freedom for all! If you buy this dvd, you deserve to lose your money!

Brokeback Mountain, Munich, Good Night, and Good Luck and Capote were more deserving of the Best Picture award. Crash has too many characters in it and none of them are developed enough for us to like them. The Hispanic locksmith comes off the best. But he's too sketchily drawn. And when the Persian storeowner pulls a gun on the locksmith's daughter, the dramatic payoff is as subtle as someone showing video of a kitten strangulation to a PETA meeting. Not all the characters in Crash are racist, but most are. One amazon reviewer was dead on when he said real racism is far more hidden that it is depicted in Crash. Obviously, Hollywood can't show what is hidden. So, we get Crash, which, in its own way, is as meolodramatic as Birth of a Nation.

2359345,4,B000A3XY5A,"The problem is with this film is that it doesn't cover all aspects of racism, which, in all intentions, it should.  For a film to start out so strong and convey a message, it should finish that message.  Racism, even in LA, takes place from all different angles.  It's much more complicated, complex, and a downfall to society than a white man yelling at someone of a different skin color.  To watch this film would make you think L.A. is full of racism and it all comes from white people.  This is not true.  I lived in Los Angeles as well as San Diego for a total of 8 years and I can tell you, as a caucasian male, that it happens to us to.

Now, with that out of the way, I have to say overall the film is superb, and there are 2 reasons why.  One is how all the different people in this film are connected, it creates a tantalizing puzzle that all comes together very well.  The other is the actors and the characters they portray.  From Sandra Bullock to Terrence Howard (yay Terrence! Congrats on best actor!) and Matt Dillon as well as so many others, You do feel like like you are experiencing the greif, the anger, and the remorse along with the characters.  I didn't watch this till it was out on DVD but after it came out I rented it, and after that I bought it.  I've watched if probably 6 times all the way through and never tire of it.

The screenwriters and director, as well as the cast, should all be applaued for a fine job.  Again, I cannot give it five stars because it does fall short of showing racism from all sides.  However, it comes close enough to show that stereotypes and fear are something we all need to overcome, NO MATTER WHAT skin color we are, to accept all people on god's great earth.",1141689600,6,1722,4.223241590214068
2359346,2,B000A3XY5A,"THE GOOD:

The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton.  Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.

THE BAD:

I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life.  BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's FAR from it.  I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective.  Some of my problems with this movie are:

(1) Poor character development (or none at all).  Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed.  Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.

(2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay.  They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do.  I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is.  I get it.

(3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laugable.  What are the chances of a black car robber running over an asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber is good after all?  Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air?  If it was THAT simple, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?

(4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism.  As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face.  I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white.  Did the store owner said because I was not white?  No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside.  Did he yell racial slurs?  No.  Racism in America is more hidden.  Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs.  If a chinese woman rear-ended me, I won't be saying ""blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!"".  On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won't say ""Mexicans are bad drivers"" in front of her face.  That's not how things work.  Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs.  That is the real racism.  It's hidden and not in your face.

Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say.  The interlocking and interweaving storylines, plots, and characters have been done before. ""Magnolia"" is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.  It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc.  It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.",1141689600,31,3808,4.530791788856305

It's actually a series of stories about ""a day in the life"" of the various otherwise unconnected characters, and how their ideas and attitudes about others and themselves play out in their daily interactions with people who are different from themselves.  While highlighting some of the attitudes of the different characters and groups, it shows that racism and stereotypes are universal characteristics of human nature, rather than the problem of one or two specific groups. The film illustrates the binds created for some people because of those attitudes, and it also shows how those attitudes are either reinforced or altered by the enocunters we have with others in the world around us.  Would like to have seen it go deeper into the motivations and ideas of some of the characters, but good film nonetheless.  Makes one think!",1141689600,6,925,4.987012987012987
2359349,5,B000A3XY5A,"'Crash' is an interesting experiment in film making, not only because of its script but also because of how the director created this genre bending film, and by that I mean that it's not your ordinary drama, which is a positive development in the right direction.  However, its theme and the subsequent handling of it created quite a bit of controversy, essentially splitting people's views of it down the middle.  I think the reason why a lot of people don't like 'Crash' is because of its context and directorial style. At times it feels like we're watching a theater play in which characters are pouring their hearts out in monologues, some type of narration purely for the sake of the audience, and then all of a sudden it turns around and gets back to reality, which was kind of a bizarre mix of atmosphere and mentality.

What I liked about 'Crash' was that the characters seemed like real people, not some typical Hollywood cardboard cutouts, and even though some of the scenarios seemed a little far fetched, at the same time they were plausible and served as great tools to explore the depths of racial tensions, inequalities and preconceived notions that all of us have to a certain extent about people from different ethnic backgrounds. This film broke down some of those barriers and exposed a little bit of the truth that none of us are who we seem to be, and that we shouldn't be too quick to judge people based on a few random circumstances or chance encounters, because we're all more complicated than the first impression that we get of someone.

Matt Dillon's character in particular was fascinating because on one side he was this racist, chauvenistic pig who abused his authority in the most despicable ways, yet at home he was dealing with an ailing father and perhaps some of his misdeeds was him projecting his fears, doubts and frustration onto those around him. Obviously nothing can excuse his actions, but later on he kind of redeems himself in the most ironic of circumstances and as the movie progresses we get to learn that there was a deeper side to him, that he wasn't as much of a scumbag that the audience was initially led to believe. Even in the most overt monster there can lie genuine love and kindness and perhaps most importantly one act commited by a human does not define them into one stereotypical role, but rather the sum of their actions and thoughts displays a better picture of their true nature.

'Crash' is a different film, and definitely not the best film that I've seen, however the performances were quite good, they were believable, and I felt for many of the characters with a myriad of emotions. It wasn't a cut and dry film where the line was drawn between good and bad, it was morally and socially ambiguous, and that was the point, to make the audience think more about these issues, re-evaluate ourselves and our points of view of how we approach stereotypes in our everyday life. The film has a powerful message and for me I finished the film with a little more insight into human nature, and for any film to achieve that, it gets high marks from me.",1141689600,5,3112,4.64065335753176
2359376,4,B000A3XY5A,"This movie was very deserving of the best picture academy award. The movie goes way beyond what has previously been shown on TV and in movies as to matters of race and culture. It has been said that there are 2 America's- one white and one black. This movie rightfully shows how outdated that thinking is. CRASH shows us that there are many America's. America's where people look Arab but are not (and pay the price for that mistake). An America where outwardly a white person appears racist but maybe his impulsive behavior is caused by some other issue. An America where black, brown and white people can and do put aside their differences for the common sport of riduculing the speech impediments of Chinese immigrants. There are many perspectives offered in this movie and all are equally valid.

When I was a teenager my Mother was viscously robbed by black men while at work. So I can empathsize (but not agree with) the affluent person who in the aftermath of the crime initially vents her anger by blaming innocent persons of the same ethnicity as her attackers. I have seen how, my own wife, a person of color herself, was overlooked for a well deserved promotion because the company wanted a less experienced but white male face in the predominately female department she worked in. Was it because of race or gender? These are important questions with no easy answers. This film is complex (and enjoyable) because it gives equal weight to the many different opinions on race and culture.

It would have been easy to have the characters who demonstrate some form of prejudice to be thoroughly contemptible persons. But this would have been far to convenient. The script takes the time for moviegoers to learn about their issues. We see the troubled police detective, the affluent wife of a big shot attorney, 2 common carjackers, a young police officer who believes he can stay above it all, a man who is continually mistaken for an Arab, the troubled wife of a televison producer. It shows each of their ordeals from a fresh perspective. Their ordeals, although experienced seperately, inevitably intersect with one another. Crash does not claim to have all the answers but it does pose good questions as to how we perceive each other in a multi-racial, multi-cultural America.",1141689600,7,2287,4.816793893129771

The characters evolutions over the film is so unbelievably contrived. I don't want to give it away, but if you've seen it, Sandra Bullock's character has the most silly, melodramatic, unbelievable transformation. I was literally rolling my eyes thinking, ""This is all it took for the angry racist Sandra from the beginning of the film to change?"" Puh-lease.

A great cast like this could have made an amazing movie...if they had a good screenplay and a competent director.

The story is about a bunch of idiot bigots who represent a small minority of people in Los Angeles (though the makers of this film would like you to believe that this is how YOU behave, in secret or otherwise). The script is heavy handed in more ways than can be written about here.

Every character in this film displays their feelings and prejudices like a bright red name tag on their foreheads.

2359381,4,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis has made a wonderful film. In style it is very reminisce of the great director Robert Altman at his best.
Crash takes us on a journey of self examination that is both thought provoking and disturbing.  Many see ""Crash"" as a movie about racism, certainly thats true but I believe it more about racial/ethnic misunderstanding.(i.e. the Storekeeper and the Locksmith) Still there is more, the film also address our famliy relationships and more importantly our fears.

If the film has a short coming its it rather negitive characterization of LAPD and other authority figures. I know its a popular opinion but it detracts from what I feel is ""otherwise insightful and balanceed film"". I also have a small concern that some negitive stereotypes maybe reforced (in the mind of the viewer) rather than disproved as some characters rant familiar but false slogons.

Postscipt:
I have found interesting the polarization found in most of theses reviews. I have come to believe that we all are ""not talking or listening to each other"". It comes to mind that that is the moral of the whole movie. ( i.e. Don Cheadle opening line: ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you.""...""I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""

There is also the element of controversy that I don't understand.
This would have been a very non-controversal film not all that long ago. Anyone remember ""South Pacific""! Yet today a film that address how badly we treat each other is ""controversal""? Have we regressed that much?

the film takes an uninspiring look at the worm inside the human heart--bigotry--as you can imagine an american movie ever risking.

2359385,5,B000A3XY5A,"I must admit that I was somewhat shocked last night when Jack announced that the winner of Best Picture was _Crash_. I was so expecting _Brokeback Mountain_ that I had hardly considered that anything else could claim the prize. And while I did love BBM, I am very satisfied with the academy's choice. _Crash_ really is a first rate film about issues that most of us can relate to in some way: sex, race, misjudgment, etc., and it is able to do this with one of the best uses of a cast that I have ever seen.

Paul Haggis's script and vision are real works of art. Just as with Million Dollar Baby, he is able to create an atmosphere of love and dissatisfaction all at the same time, and the story is very easy to follow. There is not much mystery or drama, just the story of ordinary people living their lives in an unforgiving city - pretty simple. But the real triumph here lies in the use of the cast. Actors not usually know for their depth and rage shine brilliantly here. Some of the better ones are: Sandra Bullock (not the sweet, romantic at all here), Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges (the second huge surprise), Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillippe, and Loretta Devine (Not that they are all not fabulous!) However, the real stars of the show are definitely Thandie Newton and Matt Dillon.

Newton does a superb job playing the sexually abused wife of Howard. She is both powerful and extremely vulnerable in her part, and she pulls the mix off perfectly. I was so impressed with her performance. How the academy overlooked her is a mystery to me. I have seen almost all the nominees for best supporting actress, and I can easily say that she deserved a spot on the list. As for Matt Dillon, all I can say is wow. I never would have guessed that the man had such abilities in him. I have seen a few of his movies, and I can say that you have not seen him at his best till you see _Crash_. I was so happy to see him win at the Independent Spirit Awards.

2359406,2,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH: Surprise Oscar winner? Hardly! Hollywood - and hence, the Academy - is an institution bound to cater to the lowest common denominator, and from its perch on the bottom rung, CRASH just about manages to get its message across, i.e. a) racism is endemic across all social and racial groups, and b) it's not nice. Gasp! The filmakers achieve this by trotting out a series of cardboard cutout racial - and racist - stereotypes, and then allowing each some sort of contrived redemption (or vice versa), as if audiences should be surprised to find characters capable of conflicted or contradictory behaviour. Hey, come on; that's human nature! This central conceit will be blindingly obvious to many, but I suppose CRASH's heavy-handed message might be news to some. There are halfway decent performances here from Terrence Howard, Ludacris, and especially Thandie Newton, but the dialogue is uniformly unconvincing, and the Altman-esque story intersections are at best half-baked, and at worst irredeemably ridiculous. There are many, many better movies out there tackling this and related issues, but if you like your moralizing done Hollywood style in handy sound bite-sized pieces; if you're a cozy, middle-class suburbanite with little or no experience of or interest in other cultures or lifestyles; or if your brow is just plain low, then CRASH just might be the one for you.

2359407,4,B000A3XY5A,"The film profiles the lives of several people in Los Angeles who for a variety of reasons cross each others' paths. The way they interact with one another, though, is troubling, and is really the meat of this film. Most scenes encounter racism or bigotry, screaming, crime, fear, hatred, and violence. The film's thesis, I think, is that racism and bigotry are just beneath the surface in all of our lives, but fear and anger are the reasons why it exists. In the first scene, Don Cheadle says people in LA don't touch each other, so they have to crash into each other to feel something. Connecting this to the racism theme, I take this to mean people in LA--or really anywhere with diverse populations--lack the personal connections in everyday life with other people, undoubtedly because they are afraid of their race, and don't have the skills to connect with people in a constructive way. So it's a counterintuitive, destructive cycle--we want to seek connections with people, but we're afraid of them, so we hit them over the head with bigotry, so we feel something, but we're still afraid of people, so we withdrawal, but still we need the connections, etc.

In many ways, the film states the obvious, but it is unique in its storytelling because of a non-linear narrative structure: the film begins tonight, then flashes back to yesterday evening and continues to tonight, moving to tomorrow, etc. Adding to this complexity, the ensemble cast of diverse characters--a group of about 10 people of different ethnic backgrounds, ages, and occupations--crosses paths during the film in numerous ways. We are introduced to each character/group of characters in separate scenes at the beginning of the film, then watch as one-by-one they interact with each other. We then begin to realize the ensemble is a densely interconnected group of humanity. Here's just a taste of this convoluted web: Matt Dillon is the racist cop who molests the woman whose husband is carjacked by the two guys who originally carjacked Brendan Frasier and Sandra Bullock who is at the same hospital as the Chinese woman whose husband was hurt in a carjacking by the two guys, one of whom is killed by the cop who requested to leave the beat he was sharing with Matt Dillon.

Breath.

So the film works really, really well once you get your head around the narrative structure (after the film was over we had to go back through the DVD scene index to clear up some confusion), the interconnectedness of the characters, and the statements on race and fear. (Crash just received Oscars for Best Picture and Best Editing, the latter category the one most appropriate to recongnize the film's narrative structure.)

I thought some of the situations were contrived, however, particularly Sandra Bullock's accident, the Hispanic locksmith's reaction to his daughter's nearly being killed, and the refugee scene where the one carjacker finds redemption by releasing the refugees. These situations were far-fetched and not graceful.

Crash has a decidedly Traffic feel to it, from the dramatic crescendos, dialogue, interconnected characters, to the overall tone and electronic film score. It hit me pretty hard in the end. Not as hard as Traffic, but still pretty hard.",1141603200,5,3239,4.9907407407407405

These may have been fine examples of moviemaking but only this nominee and winner Crash you can actually relate to in everyday life. Like a Robert Altman film without the overlapping dialogue Crash traces the intersecting lives of Los Angeles residents who are profoundly affected by fear and anger. Crash features strong performances by a diverse cast from Matt Dillion as the racist cop to rapper Ludercus. One of the best aspects of Crash is it's honesty from a white woman gripping the arm of her husband a little tighter when a black man walks by to the fact that even though he's a racist Dillion's cop is still human and capable of heroism. The movie also has more surprises than any suspense film this year. Bolstered by Mark Isham's beautiful music score Crash is a mesmerizing experience. Most movies operate by a specific formula to make a quick buck but Crash took a big chance by doing something different. I feel what sets this apart from other big issue movies is the fact that it's not all gloom and doom or simple black and white.

Despite its shortcomings, though, the structure of the movie is a good concept. I've always enjoyed when multiple plot lines overlap (e.g., Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).

It's a decent film that touches on the present state of racial tensions that are just below the surface for everyone, everywhere, but, the film lacks one big huge thing - common sense.

Like ""Magnolia"", ""Crash"" is about a dozen people in the Los Angeles area who intersect & interact with one another during the course of one very busy day.

The cast does a decent job at holding thing's together, but, I couldn't really care for anyone of them (the closest I got, was feeling a bit sympathetic for Matt Dillon's character).

The film gets preachy in some spots, to the point where it loses its realisitc core (do you really think that the Ludicrous character is going to change his ways overnight?).

It's a conversation/commentary on U.S. race relations kind of movie and I think the good thing about it is there really aren't any right or wrong answers.

The premise of the movie is showing how one's own hatred, poor image, bad experience(s) and/or misperceptions of another race are in fact damaging.

Not groundbreaking, in theory but the movie succeeds in going beyond the typical Black-and-White racial divides and using a series of vignettes to show that basically EVERYONE is guilty of harming someone else because of what amounts to little more than a misunderstanding and with little regard for humanity.

""Crash"" is set in racially-polarized Los Angeles, California.  The movie is somewhat metaphorical in its analogy that for the most part, people of different racial groups remain divided and only truly ""deal"" with each other in a series of ""crashes,"" like emotionally-charged automobile accidents that serve as unintended platforms for people to vent their true racial attitudes and feelings (the stuff everyone says behind close doors or among ""their own"" but shy away from airing in mixed company given our politically-correct-obsessive society).

I only see one movie a year and I prefer seeing something compelling, something different and something I won't go away saying ""There's two hours of my life I'll never get back.""

This was that movie for me in 2005.

However, I'll warn you now, I don't think this is a movie for everyone.

If you're the typical moviegoer like my close friends who prefer escapist/fantasy movie types that stray away from reality, this isn't the movie for you.

""Crash"" is entertaining in its creativity and social commentary.  It's a great movie for any high school or college sociology class.

If you're into watching movies that will force discussions afterward, also a good movie.

If you're somewhat conservative, judgmental and/or narrow-minded (I'm just being honest), you'll probably dismiss half of this movie's scenes as impossible (to actually happen) or resist its strong overall message that the United States remains very much racially segregated and intolerant even in the new millennium.

The subject matter:  the movie Crash (2004)-- the one I have probably claimed to be like the second worst i have ever scene.

From Metacritic user comments:

Okay acting + helaciously bad writing + saccarin, white bread treatment of a social issue = Crash The only people for whom this film resonates are those who have spent their entire lives in a cocoon-like state. Wake up a smell the synthetic emotional palbum that is Crash. Actually, don't do that, it'll make you sick.

Successful drama is created out of character and the dramatist's ability to show--not tell--the action. ""Crash"" is a series of predictable speeches on the subject of race, completely devoid of drama and even the tiniest inkling of grace. One wonders what all of the award giving committees were thinking.

Clich after clich. Forced coincidences galore. I almost vomited. Oh look, it's the good cop who's really bad and bad cop who's really good afterall. Silly me, I had judged him too soon didn't I!! Oh thank you film for showing me the error of my ways. So intent is this film on making it's point that it completely forgets to entertain.

This movie was AWFUL. Manipulative, blatant, predictable. Storylines that are so far-fetched and extreme, with characters who do things with little or no psychological motive. Ridiculous.

The director/screenwriter is the man who co-created Walker Texas Ranger. He obviously still has not learned to write screenplays that are not obvious, embarrassing, and extremely funny for the wrong reasons. Although Brendan Fraser was hilarious, I still prefer Chuck Norris.

This has got to be the most manipulative, hollow-shells of a movie I've ever seen. It's full of every contrived, emotional-button-pushing cliche in the book. How people found this even mildly profound is beyond me - it's silly, simplistic and naive in it's storytelling, and it's devious and heartless in it's exectution.

It doesn't earn a single of its many pseudo-profound ""insights."" All punchline; no setup.

One more example of the critics being full of crap. I quit watching this load before I finished my popcorn.

If you want an honest examination of racism in America, watch the Chappelle show, not this. This is self-concious script-writing that thinks it's being edgy, insightful and witty, but which is none of these. People don't really speak in clipped, considered, perfectly phrased soundbites. Except when they're reciting dialog by screenwriters who are essaying through the characters. I've never liked this style, especially when the writers don't have anything interesting to say in the first place. And will somebody join me in turning around this mass myth that Don Cheadle is a good actor. He's conspicuous and flat, like this movie (though he was pretty good in Out of Sight). I used to have a policy against Sandra Bullock (until I accidentally saw Ms Congeniality) and, coincidentally, against Brendan Frazier (until I accidentally saw Gods and Monsters) - it might be time to reinstate those policies.

Words alone cannot adequately describe the contempt I feel for this movie. Oooh, look!! I just proved Haggis's point!!

Scenes are more often cheesy than moving. And say it with me, its called subtelty. Just a little would have been nice.

Great movie. This movie showed how crazy America is today. Many stars at their best.  (Sorry, that one actually gave it a ten...it works as irony instead)

The most condescending movie I have ever seen. If I wanted to hear a sermon, I would go to church for free (if anything in the church can actually be called ""free""). Unlike many people who did not like this movie, I was not offended by it; I don't care if they put racism on the screen. The fault lay with the method of telling. It was so pretentious and heavy-handed that it could not be taken seriously. Also, am I supposed to be naive enough to think that every situation in life is somehow tinged with racism? That people cannot do anything without the presence of racism? Can't even have sex without one person being racist and the other being overly-offended?

Preposterous and racist film that portrays the worst in people. Avoid.

You've gotta be kidding me. How can so many critics be snowed? This is contrived, overwrought hogwash.

While I hope this movie is not true reality (at least for most people), my experience with some of my kids and their lives tells me it is.  Crash is exhausting, painful, and real.  Every character has a flaw (or many flaws), some seemingly unforgivable.  Each character also has good and something irrefutably redeemable about them--just like the rest of us.  While Crash focuses mainly on racial prejudice and all that goes along with that, it also simply shines a light on how humans relate and treat each other as friends, parents, lovers, enemies.  Crash somehow managed to show many of man's darker aspects of his psyche in a way that makes you see your own, while giving hope about the resilience of human nature and the laughter that can only come through life and all the good and bad it has to offer.  While not a fun, light date movie or anything close, there is not one person who I would not recommend this too (unless you have suffered a lot of trauma in your life already--this may bring up a few issues for you).

2359484,5,B000A3XY5A,"A lot of the other reviews have covered the basics here.  Here are just some random thoughts after watching this powerful, highly charged movie:

The acting is superb.  It is a shame no one could really be nominated for any major awards because of the brevity of each on screen.

The score by Mark Isham is near perfect.  I thought it heightened the drama of the scenes tremendously; maybe a little too much, but perhaps that is just me admitting that I was hit really hard emotionally.

The ironic twists are amazing:  How the actions of Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe's characters swing in opposite directions that you expect them to.  Ludacris is amazing, I was very surprised.  His character's life was so close to being finished and instead he gives life to others.

Don Cheatle's character is the one I was left feeling for the most.  It is that loss that stayed with me afterwards.

The film may be panned by some people who think it is liberal hogwash just asking us to all get along and sing ""kum ba yah,"" but I don't know if that is the message.  More, it is showing us how our prejudices affect how we act and how those actions reverberate and affect others around us . . .  more than we think.  It battles with stereotypes, and definitely confronts political correctness in very complex ways that no one can dismiss.

The last thing that should be applauded is that the film was not predictable.  Every scene where something dramatic was going to happen, I thought I saw the writing on the wall only to be surprised at each turn.  Kudos to Paul Haggis.",1140912000,4,1564,4.505338078291815
2359485,1,B000A3XY5A,"This movie is stupid and superficial. Mr. Haggis is trying a cheap mannipulation of the viewers's emotions just as he did in million dollar baby.

This director/screenwriter creates highly improbable scenes just to get his silly points accross. For me the worst part of the movie is when a white guy (a cop) that has been previously introduced as a black-friedly character, suddenly kills a black guy, to whom he had voluntarily given a ride, and then just dumps his body somewhere. Mr. Haggis wants to prove the point that there might be a racist in all of us and that human behavior is unpredictable. If you have more than two neurons you know that such unpredictable behaviors are highly improbable, and that the world is not all relative. Haggis just wants to force the situation and induce a cheap emotion on the viewer.

I nearly didn't watch this movie because the description didn't make that much sense to me.  I was looking to be told ""what"" happened, but this is a movie about ""WHY"".  The ""what"", of which there are many, though crucial, is nonetheless secondary to the ""why"".

None of the characters are entirely evil nor entirely good -- they've all got their ""issues"".  If the characters' motives seem exaggerated, that's why they call it ""fiction"".

2359511,1,B000A3XY5A,"With some movies, I can tell within the first minute or two that I am going to hate them. Crash is one of those movies, it commits two of the cardinal sins of filmmaking right off the bat. Sin number one: lousy new age music that tries to be spiritual and meaningful, as if to inform the viewer, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FILM. Sin number two: the movie starts with a laughably bad voiceover, an inane attempt at profound philosophy, always a sign that a movie takes itself far too seriously(trust me on this, folks, I used to write bad screenplays in my spare time, I'm as guilty as anyone of this amateur's mistake, but I was never nominated for an Oscar). In this case, it's Don Cheadle speculating that people in Los Angeles intentionally get in car wrecks in order to experience contact with others. That's right, it's not bad driving, it's some existential search for connection. Apparently people in New York never have automobile accidents because, as a pedestrian culture, they brush up against other people on a daily basis. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Unfortunately, the first couple of minutes is a harbinger of things to come. Crash is one of the worst films I've ever seen.

In the early '90's, the great Robert Altman made Short Cuts, a brilliant, jarring and subversive look at present day angst, ennui, malaise, anomie, and any other fashionable term you can come up with to describe disaffection and emotional chaos. The film was set in Los Angeles and culminated in an earthquake, which was a great metaphor for entropy as well as a method for tying all the disparate characters together through a common experience. A few years later, P.T. Barnum, excuse me, P.T. Anderson ripped off Short Cuts with Magnolia. Magnolia was terribly over the top, but what it lacked in subtlety it at least partially made up for in chutzpah. For instance, instead of an earthquake, Anderson threw in a biblical shower of frogs. Magnolia wasn't a very good film, but at least it had enough style to compensate for its screaming characters and heavyhanded analysis of human nature. Now we have Crash, yet another film about lost and lonely Los Angeleans meandering about, their lives intersecting through a series of coincidences. Instead of an earthquake, or frogs, we get a snowstorm to wrap things up, the purity of snow signifying hope, get it? Well, the third time is not the charm. Crash is a hand me down of a hand me down, watered down Altman by way of Anderson by way of Paul Haggis, only Haggis ups the ante by making his film about race relations, which is part of the problem in reviewing this film.

See, I think that one of the reasons this film is so highly acclaimed is that critics are afraid to puncture a movie that earnestly tackles an important issue. Make no mistake, racism IS an important issue, TOO important to be reduced to a bunch of one-dimensional characters, bad dialogue and contrived situations, all neatly wrapped up and delivered in a package so obvious it wears its self-importance on its sleeve. An issue as complex as racism needs a movie just as complex, because racism,and racial mistrust, are insidious things, they internalize themselves while spreading, hiding instead of expressing themselves openly in every single word of dialogue. But try telling that to Haggis. Racism is all his people talk about, and, in effect, his film comes off as one long, boring public service announcement.

But you can tell that Haggis thinks Crash is a great, arty and important film. He certainly wants it to be. He went to the P.T. Anderson school of drama and dialogue, apparently, because Crash is loaded with scenes of people screaming at each other, using the F-word at least once in every sentence. Sheltered screenwriters(and movie critics) who spend their whole lives watching movies(most of which are bad) think that this makes a film gritty and realistic. It doesn't. It just makes the movie shrill and annoying. None of these people are real, therefore the situations are unreal, therefore the social commentary is diluted. Haggis shortchanges the subject of racism by attempting to explore it in such a trivial context.

Still, the hype machine rolls on. Crash was even nominated for best picture(probably because the Academy is populated by a bunch of guilt-ridden Los Angeleans). If it wins, it might well be the worst film ever to get the award, even worse than Titanic, Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love.

Crash isn't daring, it's the exact opposite, totally safe, and its lionization has set back the cause of serious-minded, socially-conscious filmmaking at least a couple of decades.",1140652800,37,4614,4.850253807106599
2359512,5,B000A3XY5A,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. I takes a real look at how we, as people, and individuals, tend to see and unfairly label other races. There were a lot of important messages throughout this movie that obviously flew over a lot of people's heads. First of all, you have to watch this movie with an open mind without being caught up by the amazing all star cast, or by another ""racial injustice"" movie cliche. It's more than that. I liked it because it wasn't just back and white, but different ethnicities as a whole. Like it or not it's real, and people are still going through these struggles to this day. It's about being quick to judge others based on appereance alone. These are different stories crashing together (no pun intended) in order to show us that we're not as different as we may think. Like, for instance, Ryan Phillippe's character portrayed a white cop outraged by his white partner's actions towards a black couple when in actuality he was more racist than his partner could ever be. In fact, so racist that he shot and killed a black man for coming out of his jacket with what he automatically assumed would be a gun when it was indeed a small figure of a saint. Matt Dillion played his seemingly racist partner (very well I might add), but in actuality he was just another cop that was having a bad night, and decided to abuse his power like many of them tend to do. I recoginized the difference between him abusing his power and being a racist. If he were in fact a racist he wouldn't have missed that opportunity to let a black woman die, but he did his job, and saved her life no different from the rest even though he could've died. Power combined with fear for his father led him to his actions. Let's not forget, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser get car jacked by black thugs, and she's so outraged that she accuses the locksmith of being a gang banging ex-con just because he happened to be a Hispanic man with tatoos when in actuality he was just another hardworking man trying to support a daughter and a family. At any rate, her character had to realize that even though she had money, and a Hispanic housekeeper, that the Hispanic woman was indeed her best friend in the world. Even the Persian people where mistaken for Arabs when their store got vandalized just because someone was too ignorant to know the difference. I could go on and on about this movie, but I'll cut it short for now.

Or is smooth exploitation (of the ""good sort"") of racial tensions really racism...though there are other layers opened up too.  I have seen amazingly simplistic reviews by the majors like the NY Times which seem not to have really understood what they were viewing.

Anyone that can scoff at the true to life message that emanated from this film only helps to confirm the fact that their refusal to see the realizm only identifies themselves as being actual contributors and supporters of the injustices and prejudices of our world today.  Whether anyone else chooses to belief it or not, in order to make good use of something such as an artist bringing real life awareness through his hard work and god given talent, we must become more in tune with our own sensitivies enough to the point of recognizing that these things happen around us everyday and identify it to be a massive plague that just gets worse over time.  There is always strength in numbers and each of us taking our own individual responsibility toward putting someone else's efforts to good use as they have intended and making a positive contribution by sharing the reality and existence of goodness in others is an integral part of ever having hopes that we can make a change large enough to make a real difference in the world.  As the old addage states ""it's a constant battle of good vs evil.""  Instead of criticizing and fueling the flames of evil, find the goodness in your heart and give an unselfish and dedicated fight for the good.

And by powerful, I mean extremely boring. Basically what the movie boils down to is two hours of white liberal guilt, the movie was written and directed by Paul Haggis, writer of Million Dollar Baby, and needless to say the liberal movie academy ate the movie up giving it six nominations.

The movie starts off with a car crash involving Don Cheadle (NFL Playoff Commercials) and Jennifer Esposito (Dracula 2000). Cheadle is really shaken up and goes off to la-la land before we head back to yesterday. I have to say the going back in time has become the most annoying plot devise currently used today in movies and television. There should really be a moratorium on using it. What's worse in this movie, and this may ruin it a little, but not as much as watching it played off ruined the movie, but they never come back to this crash later in the movie unless I fell asleep and completely feel asleep.

Early on we are also introduced to two black men, Larenz Tate (of the wrongfully shelved Love Money) and Chris Bridges (who you may, or more likely not know as Ludacris) who complain how a white woman clutches her husband as they come closer only to carjack the couple. And knowing Bridges is a rapper in real life only makes his soliloquy against the genre cheesier. The couple in question is Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality 1 & 2) and Brendan Frasier (Encino Man), who is the District Attorney who is mad that being robbed by a couple black dudes may hurt retaining the black vote in the next election.

There's also yet another good cop, Ryan Phillippe (Mr. Reece Witherspoon), bad cop, Matt Dillon (Herbie: Fully Loaded) tandem who pull over a black couple just for fun and the black dude, Terrence Howard (Mary J. Blige's Be Without You video) just stands there and lets Dillon molest his wife, Thandie Newton (The Chronicles of Riddick). Just for fun, Haggis even threw in families full of Hispanics, Asians, and Arabs just so no one would feel left out. Well except the Indians are once again forgotten. At least you still have baseball teams that make light of your racial stereotypes.

Each of the characters eventually intertwines with each other showing up in other storylines much like a Lost flashback. But much like this season of Lost, it all becomes ho-hum when you see this happening mostly because you see it coming a mile away. Speaking of Lost, be sure to look out for Jin who makes a blink and you miss it cameo.

Do they feel that because the film goes the way of being (semi-)Politically Incorrect, that somehow its message is somehow new, or more important, or better than any other films that tackle the race question (if that question even exists)?  This movie wants to be so bold and noble, but other than dropping a few one liners about sterotypes (some of which can be pretty funny), there is nothing bold or original about this film.  There's really nothing negative I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  I just wish that more people were able to see through the crap, the cliches, and the trite, and recognize that this is a perfect example of someone (Haggis) trying WAY too hard to say something that's already been said.  Not only has it been said, its been said better.  If you're really interested in watching a GOOD film dealing with race relations, watch Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing (1989), or the French film La Haine (Hate) and skip this crap. Neither of those films are as cheesy and melodramtic.  The characters seem MUCH more real, the scenerious are so much more believable, and even when those films to break away from convention into the UNbeliveable, they're handled with grace, maturity, and depth...instead of forcing us, through bad music, slow motion, and unnecessary, over-dramatic climaxes that attempt to change us and the characters.

The film opens with a ""Crash"" in which an Asian woman has rear-ended a car driven by Jennifer Esposito and Don Cheadle who also happen to be cops.  The film then backtracks and we see what has happened over the previous two days in their lives as well as the lives of several other characters.  We see a Latino locksmith, a white D.A., a black director, two black car theives, a Persian immigrant family, two white cops.  All of these lives, touched by and filled with racial annimosity.

The acting is superb.  Matt Dillion, who is up for best supporting actor, really hit this one out of the ball park.  What a performance!  I really hope he wins, as he is one of those very good actors who never seems to get any recognition.  Another great performance, in a film full of them, is Don Cheadle (no surprise).  He is such a great actor, I'm not sure how he has managed not to win an Oscar.  This guy is golden.

I *am* angry, however, at the people who are labeling this a great film.  I particularly enjoy Roger Ebert's defense he wrote for it a while ago, where he's just short of saying that yes, it is an utterly moronic, hopelessly manipulative piece of junk, but it has GOOD INTENTIONS!!! dammit, so take your damn medicine!  I especially love the great language people use to rename the worst aspects of `Crash':  These aren't shallow, cliched characters, they're `archetypes', this movie isn't a bunch of simplistic, contrived scenarios, it's a series of `parables'. (Yeah, 20 parables, each of which has exactly the same message.  And parables aren't exactly known for their dramatic value either.  And finally, parables are at least vaguely symbolic; these scenarios aren't)  Of course, they've gotta do this, cause if they described it accurately it'd sound like a terrible film, sound like the sorta film they'd all pan if it weren't a VERY IMPORTANT FILM!!!!!  The critics are correct, however, in saying that most of the performances are excellent, but the movie is just too idiotic and manipulative allow this to really help any.  In a way it makes it worse, to see these people put the effort into such an absurd farce of a film.

Yes, this movie does contain the thrilling, shocking message that RACISM IS BAD!  People think this movie is gonna reduce racial tension?  Give me a frickin' break.  First of all, no movie ever really changes anyone, and second, it doesn't even really make any sort of intelligible statement.  People are racist, the film says, and that makes bad things happen, or it at least makes bad things happen in the hilarious fantasy land of 'Crash', where everyone is a raving lunatic.  That is absolutely all their is to it.  There is no real discussion of racism in this film whatsoever.  But, surprisingly, it isn't the shallow, heavy handed message which gets to me.  It's the fact that in order to facilitate this supposed message they created some of the most dramatically lame scenes imaginable.

This movie doesn't really have a plot, actually, it's mostly just a pile of random scenes and coincidences.  I don't mind this in and of itself, really, but most of the individual scenarios prove to be very stupid, and again, exactly the same.  The characters are absurdly flat and simplistic, though they do all show a tendency to behave in a manner utterly inconsistent with that which we saw earlier: The ravingly racist cop risks his life to save a black woman in a staggeringly melodramatic scene, (the scene where the movie really went to hell, by the way); the calm, arguably cowardly black man flips out and takes on a couple of armed thieves and whole pack of cops and so on.  The film has a ton of characters, so they couldn't have fleshed them out much, but Haggis doesn't even seem to try.

But, again, up until the midpoint the film is just kinda stupid and simple-minded, but not really offensively bad.  It's repetitious, as it's just people being racist or complaining about racism and so on, but it's still all right.  But then when Haggis tries to make things come together, oh my god!  The second half of this film has 3 major climactic scenes which are just unbearable, the latter 2 of which are amongst the weakest scenes of all-time.  First we've got the aforementioned  racist cop and black woman whom he molested earlier scene.  This scene is just so amusing because it's unbelievably operatic, as if I care about either of these losers.  Let `em burn.  The real rock-bottom centerpiece of the film, the scene that really earns it the resounding F, is the confrontation between Daniel and the Iranian shop owner.  I don't wanna specifically spoil it, but this is by far the most manipulative scene I can think of in any film I've ever seen.  I could see where it might be going, and I thought, no, no way Haggis thinks this little of me.  No way he'd use such a low, obvious tactic, such easy, forced emotion.  And then he actually does it, and what's more he shot it in such an over the top fashion that I actually laughed aloud at the climactic, supposedly tragic moment.  And then, after all that, he uses a ridiculous cop out, unwilling to go through with the forced emotional manipulation that he just thrust on the audience.  Seriously, this scene is so bad that I wanna hit Paul Haggis in the face.  He deserves it.  And then we've got another major scene where Phillipe's character picks up a hitchhiker that is just so stupidly, contrived, and all based on the sort of bullsh*t movie miscommunication that never happens in the real world that it just really makes me angry.  (And it also involves characters behaving in a way utterly incosistent with what we've seen earlier.)  Shortly thereafter the movie just ends, kinda randomly, what with it's not having a central plot or anything, and thank god.  The rest of the film was just kind of foolish and inconsequential, but man, that stuff just really irritates me.  How about you get to work on a `Walker: Texas Ranger' film Haggis. (Which he created, amusingly enough.)  You ain't prepared to deal with serious topics.

Uhh, what a pathetic joke this film is.  Just when you thought mainstream film criticism couldn't get any more ridiculous they go around declaring this laughable PC pap one of the best films of the year.  [sigh]

2359547,5,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis has touched a very sensitive subject of racism in America, but the movie is so well written and directed, that it will hardly make anyone upset. The movie is about people living in Los Angeles, coming from different races, and their everyday brush-up with racists including the LAPD cops. A must see, if you always thought that LA is all about Hollywood, skyscrapers, and cosmopolitan town. The movie is very intense, and gives you enough to think about reality in big cities of America.

This movie is not about we all discuss and share with people, but about what we actually think and believe, which we never want even our best friends to know. All the actors have done an excellent job, and the dialogue delivery is brilliant. Very realistic! Deserves all the five stars.",1139961600,15,787,4.744525547445256
2359548,2,B000A3XY5A,"It's surprising to see Hollywood make a film in which racism is the major theme. That the movie simplifies the topic and relies mostly on insane coincidence and two dimensional characters to tell the story is not surprising. Here's the movie: Character 1 screams a racial epithet. Character 2 screams a racial epithet back. Through some ridiculous happenstance the character is either redeemed or has something terrible happen to them. At the end everything is solved and wrapped up nicely. The only piece of illuminating information in the film is that Los Angeles is the most hateful city on the planet, and everyone there is extremely upfront and confrontational with their prejudices and hatred of the other races around them. I just hope the success of the film leads to more movies that deal with racism in a more realistic way, and that are actually thought provoking and humane.",1139961600,5,886,4.953020134228188
2359549,2,B000A3XY5A,"All I heard about was how great this movie was.  It seemed all of the movie critics were raving about how powerfully it communicated a message that we all need to hear.  I wasn't even sure what this movie was about until I started watching it, I just knew it was supposed to be great.  Well, now I have seen the movie and I am still unsure of what the message was.  You may think I am an idiot because I didn't find the point totally obvious, but we are all entitled to our own opinions.  The first thing I noticed about the movie is that the dialogue was slightly corny.  I am not sure if it was the words they were speaking, or the actors themselves.  Several times I felt the ""power"" of the movie was being compromised by the ridiculous acting and script.  I did appreciate what the movie was trying to do.  Having a little bit of a background in sociology I thought that Crash at least tried to show us that making generalizations about people based on their physical appearance is wrong.  However, I also feel that this movie managed to somehow propagate several stereotypes.  I was confused as to who was good in this movie and who was bad.  Then I realized that there is no good and bad, there is only the confusion of trying to figure it out.  Most movies are black and white(pardon the pun) when it comes to deciding who to root for. (...following may give away certain plot points...assuming you can actually call it a plot) I do applaud this movie for at least showing us all the shades of grey.  Is the Matt Dillon cop bad because he fondled the attractive black woman, or is he good because he saved her life?  Is the other cop good because sticks up for minorities, or is he bad because he shoots one?  What is the message we are supposed to take from this?  Crash raised several questions in my mind that I think are good to think about and talk about.  Few movies can actually achieve that.  Therefore, even though this movie kind of stunk, it does have its redeeming qualities.  I have to comment on the gentleman who feels that all police officers should have to watch this movie.  Does it really do that good of a job at teaching ethics to cops? Or, did he just want them to see the proper technique for a reach-around?  Anyways, go rent this movie and see it for yourself before forming your opinion.  Regardless of your true opinion you better tell everyone you loved it, so you won't be accused of being a racist by all the white folks that were truly inspired by this powerful movie.",1139961600,4,2506,4.341935483870968
2359570,3,B000A3XY5A,"What is most intriguing about Crash is not its message about race relations, which doesn't provide any new insights on the topic.  Nor is it the elevation of the automobile to a starring role, so appropriate to the way we lead our lives: all fifteen or so of the chief characters' lives are altered by cars in some way (mainly through accidents and thefts).  Rather, what is intriguing about Crash is the intricate interconnection of all the characters in the ten or so seemingly standalone subplots.  After I watched the DVD, I diagrammed it: I had twenty boxes indicating the fifteen main characters plus fie minor characters, and over thirty lines linking them all up.  In fact, at the end of the movie the action has to circle back to the beginning so a key relationship can be revealed.

If you watch this movie as a puzzle to be solved, you may enjoy it.  If you try to relate to the characters or to look for new insights in its apparent messages, you may come up short.",1139875200,3,977,4.491525423728813
2359571,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is one of those movies that can be considered especially culturally relevant at certain times and during certain 'windows of opporunity'-- the reason being that it involves a lot of humbling questions that we are each left to ask ourself at the end of the movie, and many of these questions which may require the individual to be honest with his/her self and momentarily put aside the ego.

People originally used labels and stereotypes because life was too short for each one of us to be a scientist empirically documenting every sense experience and their effects, so after a while we tended to rely more and more upon prior experiences handed down throughout history- trials and errors, tested and true, etc. The problem was that sooner or later you had a few people who were in a position to set policy who wisened up to this and figured out that you could manipulate public perception on a very large scale depending on your agenda, and could therefore heavily influence the life decisions and ultimately the life chances of major ethnic and racial groups based on public perception-- thus although many stereotypes may have had at some point a very small basis in fact, people are far too varied even amongst their own cultural ethnicities and races to retain any sort of labels or stigmas. This, however, has not stopped people from pre-judging (prejudice) or from discriminatory behavior that results from this pre-judging.  Crash exhibits this policy we have adopted and mantained culturally in action, in every-day life as it occurs through the spectrum of diversity.  People want security and fear what they don't know or understand, and as a result it is no wonder we rely on a stereotype rather than actually find out for ourselves and expose ourself to such a large degree of vulnerability.  All this fear is further compounded by the culture of war we have created both within ourselves and in the world we live in. The drum of fear constantly being beaten by the war machine, maintaining and feeding all of our worst fears.

There are no new ideas in Crash that you wouldn't formally glean from any sociology text or class (albeit through different prose and delivery), however, as mentioned previously the difference is that it shows this prejudice and discrimination in action, how it operates in our daily lives on both conscious and sub-conscious levels in a format that most people can either relate to, or at the very least better comprehend. Maybe we need this refresher course through this sort of Medium to cater to our ever-shortening attention spans.  The more time we waste in needless arguments and petty strifes based on perceived differences the less we are able to look above all this confusion and observe the ones behind the curtains, setting policies and agendas, and truly controlling our fates through our fears. People really need to stop perceiving the illusion of difference between one another.  It is only by buying into such poor culturally fed beliefs you have surrendered your will to the agenda of a few who like nothing more than to control and exploit the power you have to rise above it.  Crash is reinforcement of concepts which need to be reminded on a collective level, that we are much more alike then we are different. Don't forget that racial and ethnic issues only remain today because they are functional in our society; they are functional as a distraction, as a way of limiting and preventing access to privileges and opportunities afforded select groups and individuals, and most importantly they are functional in maintaining the 'status quo' and cultural hegemony.",1139875200,2,3632,4.9135399673735725

In order to successfully appreciate and understand certain classes and ideas, there are certain books you must read. This is where I get the phrase, ""Required Watching"". This is a movie that should stand the test of time. First of all it has one of the most spirited actors I have ever seen, Don Cheadle. This movie takes the tangled lives of several different characters from very contrasting backgrounds and throws them into a big boiling pot of life. THis is not only a good movie but it also teaches a valuable lesson. It is the totality of the circumstances that make us the way we are. That as human beings we may carry labels, good or bad, but that life and society would function better if we all looked beyond those labels to see why people act, and react, the way they do.

Everyone in the film acted superbly and it was very well written in my opinion.  I also loved the song ""Maybe Tomorrow"" by the Stereophonics that played during the credits at the end of the movie, clearly the best song put out by that particular band.",1139788800,2,551,4.649484536082475
2359574,1,B000A3XY5A,"A mostly phenomenal multiethnic cast is squandered in Paul Haggis' hysterically overheated and laughably - and ultimately depressingly - one-dimensional take on race relations (and barely anything else) in modern-day Los Angeles. I absolutely agree with David Edelstein's 'Slate' review: ""Haggis wants to distill all the resentment and hypocrisy among races into a fierce parable. But the old-fashioned carpentry (evocative of '30s socially conscious melodrama) makes this portrait of How We Live Now seem preposterous at every turn. A universe in which we're all racist puppets is finally just as simpleminded and predictable as one in which we're all smiling multicolored zombies in a rainbow coalition.""

Right after I watched `Crash', my first impression was: What if the Mayor of Los Angeles set up a meeting with some movie studio heads and said, ""You know something, this city is getting just too crazy & overpopulated, and we really need to do something about it.  How about making an `anti-infomercial' for our town that depicts this place as unsavory, freakishly hostile, and all-around reprehensible & uninhabitable as possible?""

If you don't happen to think this movie is shallow, I'd just like to point out what a perfect match it would make in a flashy DVD 2-pak right alongside 'Falling Down,' with Michael Douglas taking his ludicrous Alienated-White-Man `agenda' out on the big, bad & oh so unjust metropolis!  Seriously - `Crash' is that ridiculous movie's unofficial sequel, only with a fractured, quasi-Altmanesque story structure that is teeth-gnashingly contrived in its hokey setups and payoffs.  This is melodrama of such spectacular grandiosity and pomposity that it must make executive producers of daytime soap operas scarlet-faced and shuddering with envy.

Still, I will wager anyone who's interested that 'Crash' is going to be the big upset at this year's Oscars & win Best Picture instead of `Brokeback Mountain' - it's just melodramatic & `controversial' and `tough-minded' and `hard-hitting' enough to be considered `serious movie-making'...when very unfortunately it is only what PASSES for serious movie-making these days.

And while we're on the subject - what in the world is up with Tony Danza's cameo as the mega-racist Second Coming Of Satan!?  For god's sakes, what's next, Richard Simmons as an owner of an underground neo-Nazi, pro-KKK aerobics gym!?",1139788800,8,2395,5.385026737967914
2359575,1,B000A3XY5A,"Two words can describe this waste of two hours: NO PLOT.  It's nothing but racial hate for 2 hours.  And for this you get nominated for awards?

So the movie starts out hitting the viewer with several racial stereotypes:  blacks are violent criminals, blacks are drug abusers, arabs are angry, violent convenience store owners, asians can't drive, whites fear blacks [because they are violent criminals], and the laundry list goes on.  Again, there is no plot or real character development to make the viewer at all interested in any of the legion of characters.  Then, there is absolutely nothing done to dissuade the viewer from seeing these as facts.  The black men are violent criminals.  Don Cheadle's mother is a drug abuser.  The Iranian convenience store owner is angry and violent.  These stereotypes are actually reinforced again and again.  As I was watching, I couldn't help but think the title should have been trainwreck because that is what the movie truly is.

I think somehow the writer intended for some message of hope or redemption in the twists that occur in the lives of this multitude over these couple of days. But the reality is, none of these characters change!  None of them has any great epithany!  There is no life changing moment of clarity.  There is no message of hope.  And there is nothing to tear down the stereotypes that have been reinforced by this film.  Will Sandy Bullock cross to the other side of the street the next time she sees two black men walking toward her at night.  You bet she will.  Will those black men continue to steal high-end cars for cash.  Yeah.  Will the Arab store owner with rage issues go after the next non-Arab that looks at him funny.  Yes, he will.

Same for the interlocking stories.  Rediculously clever but a distraction.  This made me think of the movie ""Go"" which ends at the beginning, begins at the end, etc.

There are way too many characters, every single one of them based on racial stereotypes and its misconceptions. One never really learns the core essence of any of the characters, other than what they think of other races. Incidentally, almost every race is represented in this film. If they were going to attempt to include every race, I am puzzled as to why they left out the Eastern and Native American Indians...

The plot, if it can be called a plot, is unrealistic and contrived. Throughout the film, there is constant buildup of events leaving the audience sitting through all of the movie on the edge of their seats with no clear resolution in sight. I find this manipulative and couldn't wait for the movie to just end already. The movie just adds tension upon tension and its climax is only just barely reached towards the end when, oh yeah, the vast amount of characters in this movie pass through each other's lives. Wow. Deep. There is nothing new to learn in this movie that cannot be learned from the news or just observing daily life.

Sadly to say, stereotypes is a sad fact of life that won't be leaving anytime soon until society becomes less privileged and more equal for everybody. Basing a movie soley on stereotypes is plain boring. There is no story in it. I suggest watching the original, Amores Perros, or 21 Grams. They're highly more entertaining, although gruesome.

There were like 5 guys in there, and none of us was the same race.  Needless to say our blood started to boil immediately at the sight of an 'other', and the tension in the room became enormous.  We were in the middle of a bloodbath in less than a minute.  I have little recollection of the next few minutes, until I found myself sitting in the midst of an enormous pile of blood and limbs-- the racial hatred was so intense that I blacked out, more or less.  Me and one other guy were still alive, the other 3 torn limb from limb.  The black xenophobic hatred was not dissipated at all, but we rested briefly, feeding on the flesh of out mangled enemies, preparing for our final bout for racial supremacy.  Then, as I sucked the blood from one of my victims via the carotid artery I glanced over the scattered pile of DVDs and noticed a number of copies of Paul Haggis' 'Crash' scattered about the floor.  I'd seen this movie, but more or less forgotten about it.  Seeing it now I was filled with insight and deep sorrow.  I dropped the corpse, than stood up and let out a primal scream of despair.  This aroused my enemy, and he discarded his meal  and bared his bloody maw at me.  I fell to my knees and gasped ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS NOT HOW PAUL HAGGIS WANTS US TO BEHAVE!!!!!!! RACISM IS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  I feared my impending death, though I was calm with my final epiphany before my eternal slumber.  I waited for my doom, then looked at my former enemy again; he was in tears.  He had seen 'Crash' as well, and now he understood.  Understood all, late, yes late, but not too late.  We came together and embraced in tears, never to commit genocide again.  Than we went to see 'Brokeback Mountain' together, and really had a rather good time.

Badly written and directed, the film is so busy telling me that it is a terribly important film about racism, but it never really gets around to being a terribly important film about racism.  It moves from one easily predicted big scene to another, giving the actors lots of Big Scenes where they can scream at each other but not much else.

The film finally sinks under its own Self-Importance.  Avoid it.",1138752000,17,465,4.5
2359632,4,B000A3XY5A,"This was a great film that took a deep look at the racism, steriotypes and misconceptions that suround us everywhere. The fear of others and the fear of the unknown show that, although different on the outside, people are more similar than they thought. The steriotypes and racism is not going to go away, but if that is the foundation for someone's actions and beliefs, then it will make for some messy situations. As for how the film was set up, the characters have individual lives and stories that blended together brilliantly. It shows how everyone is self concerned and never thinks or don't care that their actions will affect others.",1138752000,2,641,4.783783783783784
2359633,5,B000A3XY5A,"The opening scene of the film. A Persian man goes to buy a gun with his daughter. The owner of the shop asks their choice of ammunition explaining: We got a lot of things that fit. We got long colts, short colts, ball heads, flat-nose, hollow points, wad cutters and a dozen more that all fit in the same size hole, just depends how big a ""bang"" you can handle.

What a summary of the film in the first 10 mins.

Anyway, Crash is a film that attempts to integrate short-story parallels into a feature length film through the use of character and plot coincidences. The story is set in contemporary Los Angeles and intrudes upon the lives of several families - a bitter police officer who takes care of his aging father suffering from chronic urinary infection, a black TV director and his headstrong wife, an Espanic locksmith and his daughter who is recovering from the recent memory of a stray bullet entering her room, a paranoid Persian shop-owner and his daughter, two black carjackers, a District Attorney and his angst-ridden wife and a black detective officer and his Puerto-Rican partner (who are also lovers). The one thing that unites them is the very same thing that divides them - the colour of their skin.

It would not be wrong to consider this film experimental (or an independent film) because discusses the sensitive and taboo issue of racism (which many studios try to avoid) and share the narrative leads between eight different characters (the norm in feature length films are to have two or three protagonists at the very most). This unorthodox approach by Paul Haggis (writer/director) is very much a result of his many years of television producing, where it is the norm to have multiple characters share lead roles over six-hundred minutes a season.

One of the main strengths of this film lies in the form of the narrative. The use of an objective camera which translates into a largely objective perspective of the Crash film world, presents the spectator with the responsibility of the restricted knowledge it imparts within the story-telling system. For the most part, the spectator is in the position of power, fully aware of character back-stories, conscious of many character actions and motivations which are oblivious to the characters within the film. Thus providing the spectators the role of passive participants unable to shape or affect the film world; this device is rendered relevant and more powerful because of its racism themes. Hence, the `crime' behind racism - of assumption and judgement is transferred from the character's perspective into the spectators' viewing identity. A scene where Ryan Philippe's character who mistakenly shoots a black youngster because he suspected he had possession of a gun clearly illustrates this dynamic system, which puts us in a position of guilt for allowing the `crime' to occur.

The character-spectator relationship in this film is alarmingly powerful. Crash is highly self-reflexive in this regard because it manages to trap the spectator into a accountable position. This is visible in the scene where Sandra Bullock's character lashes out at her husband to change the house locks again the next morning because she fears that the locksmith will sell the extra set of keys to his `gang-banger' friends based on his appearance (skinned-head, tattoos and baggy pants). We soon realize that the locksmith is a loving family man struggling to make a living just like everyone else when we are taken into his home.

To minimize confusion, Haggis uses two excellent devices to draw a link with his characters: music as punctuation and editing transition. Not only is music used to embrace characters to aid identification, it is used to highlight moments of emotional reaction; because there are so many emotions involved with the problem of racism from anger, bitterness, guilt to sadness and resignation, moments of contemplation are aided with a score that tries to be subtle.

Crash anchors heavily on coincidences and character reversals to suggest a statement on racial tolerance. While many will be quick to point out that his story plots are too contrived, it is safe to say that this is film is not attempting to be a `slice of life' take on racism in LA but rather a representation of the struggle within this multicultural community. Obviously there are intentional moments that conjure up the common `yeah right' from the audience but without putting our cynicism in the `production' of the story but rather allow the film to make us feel pain, disgust, embarrassment, anger and sadness to hopefully perpetuate a sense of peace and tolerance.

Should win best picture this year for me. Its an important film, one that celebrates both the diversity and commonality among human beings.",1138752000,6,4777,5.0

Needless to say I was thrilled last night when Roger Ebert named CRASH as his number one choice on his top ten list of best movies of 2005.  I couldn't agree more!,1138492800,,357,4.619047619047619

2359640,5,B000A3XY5A,"What I liked best about Crash was the way in which they showed multiple sides of each character.  It is impossible to altogether hate or love each character, because, as in real life, they each have a positive and negative side.

Although the movie may seem stereotypical to some, I think that instead of portraying sterotypical characters, it just reveals the stereotypes that each person in the movie holds for others.

It did a great job of involving me in each character's story, and I would highly recommend the movie to anyone (and indeed I have recommended it to everyone I know).",1138406400,,587,4.735294117647059

I do have one problem with the movie it somethings Goes over the top(the characters do things that would never really happen in real life) Also They all seem too moviated by race in thier daily lives, for example everything they say and do is mostly movitaved by race and race only, which kinda keeps it from being great but good nontheless, THis is a film everyone should pick up Becuase race and discrimation effects all of us Hopefully This film is a step in the right direction.",1138147200,,789,4.486111111111111
2359682,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a great movie. Few modern movies can impact a person as powerfully as this movie did, and Crash does that and more. You can't just watch this movie. You think about it, and wonder what if. What if you were in a situation like the ones the people in this film were? What if you were the recipient of some harsh and blunt racism? What if you reacted the way that these people do to racism? Questions that are, in the end, purely relevant in today's world... questions that have and probably, sadly, always will be relevant.

Crash is about L.A., a huge city full of all kinds of different people, and what happens when these people are forced to deal with each other. The odd thing is it's the one thing that tears us apart as a society that brings these characters together: racism. The movie follows many different people as they live through two days in the city, while also handling and dishing out their own personal forms of hatred. The cast is huge, and the stories themselves are powerful and merciless. Where one man learns a lesson, another loses a loved one. Where one person gets a second chance, another loses everything in one dramatic moment. The sad thing is is that a lot of the hatred is based on simple stereotypes and ignorance, and the people in this story go from ignorance to knowledgeable, and are left with the option of whether they should continue to hate, or decide otherwise.

From start to finish, the theme of this movie is clear, and you're kind of left breathless with how harshly that theme is presented. You feel for the characters who are the objects of the racism, while you're also forced to understand the people who give out that racism. It's a constant, emotional swing; there are times when you're shouting at the screen and there are times when your eyes sting with tears. It's easy to be affected by the happenings in Crash.

For anyone looking for a good, modern movie to watch, pick this up and place all your sensitivities aside. Crash is a movie of pure relevance that should be seen by everyone. What it represents, what it teaches, is something that is very difficult to teach, and Crash teaches its lesson perfectly.",1138147200,,2174,4.554987212276215

It's about a group of people, all races and colors, and it shows how each one of them is a bit racist, in their own ways.  Some, not so much so, subtle things; but others very blatantly.  The movie really just paints a picture, it doesn't preach.

I of course, enjoyed the movie.  The actors were excellent.  The story was unique and interesting.  Needless to say, everything about it was thought-provoking.  One thing that I didn't care for, was that I felt the movie asserted that everyone is racist.  And I don't know if I truly agree with that.  Plus, they used a lot of shock-value things to get your attention, to make the point.  I don't know if that was necessary.  But, maybe it was.

The logistics alone, of managing the ""who's who"" cast, is worth Oscar recognition.

2359688,5,B000A3XY5A,"Amazing movie. The cinematography, the music, the plot, the subject matter...MOVING!

Don Cheadle's character opens the movie with a few profound lines. His girlfriend/co-worker just wrecked - and in all the chaos you hear him thinking. He considers how isolated, how lonely we are - and in our desperate search and longing for human touch and relationship - we crash into each other just to engage.

Stereotypes and racism are the main topics the movie addresses. The thoughts each race has about each other - they way those stereotypes play out - the casualties they bring.

Powerful, engaging, heart-wretching - and perhaps, the most appropriate: CONVICTING.

For some reason, we give ourselves reasons/permission to judge and assume in areas we have no business doing so. In the end, that kind of behavior only turns against us. We are so interested in entering the realm of God, foolish to think we can handle it.

Crash - another reminder of the depravity and selfish human heart of ALL peoples.

Only Love will cure - only grace can mend. These things are actions not of this world. All we seem to be interested in is wrecking. Crash is the verb of our world.",1137801600,,1166,4.805
2359689,2,B000A3XY5A,"Coincidences reign in this movie. People with no relationships to one another keep running into each other. Since there are so many interweaving story lines and since no one gets along, the movie is hard to watch. This is not all bad. Shakespeare tragedies are hard to watch, but can be enjoyed at an artistic level. The movie is good in some respects, but it does not really resolve anything. It sets up stereotypical characters and then tries to puncture our views about them. The trouble is at the end you don't care about any of the characters. I'm not sure why I dislike the movie. I guess I feel the movie tries to manipulate me to be more understanding rather than help me to be more understanding.

The good points are the acting and the sets. The plot, although it has many story lines, is pretty simplistic and the surprises are telegraphed by the music and the simplistic writing. The white guy who gets his car stolen is a District Attorney. His wife is a bigot. Who would have known? When people are stressed, they exhibit more bigoted behavior. Wow. I never knew that. Jerks can be heros too in a different situation. Surprise? Nice guys can make stupid decisions in other situations. No one gets along in this movie and they all most likely will make stupid decisions.

2359691,5,B000A3XY5A,"This movie is absolutely wonderful; and in my opinion, in this age of forced cultural diversity training, would be an excellent film to view and discuss.

I have never seen anything else quite like it.  It interweaves the lives of complete strangers ... black, white, Hispanic, Chinese, and Indian.  Each person, due to personal experiences, has perceptions about those of other races.  Due to these perceptions, given a certain set of circumstances, those perceptions rise to the surface, making a bad situation even worse.

What's so wonderful about the film, however, is how these perceptions become a mirror, reflecting each individual's hatred back at himself; and in each instance, the person does not like what he is seeing.  For instance, when a white cop molests a black woman, he is later put in the position of saving her life.  She, of course, pushes against him, while he is trying to save her life.  In that moment, they are both changed, for the better.

This is one of the most unique films that I have ever seen.

This movie plays like a high-school senior treatise on American racial stereotyping. It cleverly uses reverse stereotypes to give the audience ""aha"" moments, but that doesn't diminish the puppet-master morality play atmosphere that reduces characters down to two-dimensional symbols.

The ""cross-cut"" scripting technique, which magically intersects the lives of unrelated people, is really getting old and particularly heavy-handed here. If you want to see movies that handle racism elegantly, try Watermelon Man or Hollywood Shuffle. They succeed with humor where Crash fails with drama.

Plenty of good performances by plenty of good actors are wasted in this tutorial. If only those actors and performances could have found their way into movies about believable people. Racism can't be approached as a single theme in an issue-oriented movie any more than love or death could.

It is the story of several intersecting lives in modern-day Los Angeles, of characters from different racial backgrounds, and of how the prescribed stereotypes of those backgrounds affect the characters' values, beliefs and life decisions.  The action centers around the death of a boy and works backwards to reveal how each of the players in the tale is connected to one another through close contact or casual relations.  This film takes the viewer on a highly emotional roller coaster through the racial profiles, stereotypes, preconceived notions, behaviors, language and lifestyle of a cross section of Americans. The film is raw, the language is shocking at times, the acting (for the most part) is amazing. I particularly thought that Sandra Bullock's performance as the spoiled white wife of a District Attorney, albeit small, was incredibly convincing and disturbing- she is a far cry from her comedy typecast days.

Complimented by a wonderful soundtrack, clever cinematography and a web of colorful stories , ""Crash"" should appeal to all walks of American life.  Virtually all dominant racial groups in America are targeted and corresponding stereotypes smattered across the screen in an unapologetic manner that is simultaneously insulting, disturbing, humorous and loving.  ""Crash"" is not meant to be the Holy Grail of race relations in modern America , but it is meant to be, and succeeds (in an industry often plagued by the search for the ideal happily ever after ending) in examining a very sensitive and often times politically incorrect topic of race and prejudices  The upshot is that the viewer sees the blatant irony that characters who hold so much unconditional love for their relatives and equally such disdain for strangers- that these same characters would do anything, including lie, cheat, torture and kill another stranger, for that very love.

The film is very powerful and a welcome new entry in the homogenous landscape of Hollywood happy endings.  Don't miss it.",1137024000,,2021,5.232198142414861
2359721,5,B000A3XY5A,"When watching this film, two thoughts came to mind, first the Buddhist metaphor for life, that is to say, existence is a large tapestry, and we the threads of the tapestry, intertwined and interconnected, and that any of our actions, can affect the whole. The other thought was the early 90's film, Six Degrees of Separation; a young Will Smith plays the prostitute con man, affecting the lives of a wealthy Manhattan family. The premise being that none of us are separated more than six degrees, and that our actions or non-actions has a ripple effect to others, perhaps those we've never met. In other words, we are all connected. Crash has many other themes, including violence in modern society fuelled by the constant undercurrent of racism. It is understandable why this film was so controversial upon its release, as it is pretty hard-edged, and explores a few touchy issues that are topical and will continue to be so in the future.

The film begins with Don Cheadle, a police detective, commenting that the people in L.A. never make contact or touch each other because they're always travelling by car, -""separated by glass and steel""- and communication only occurs when their vehicles crash into each other. There's been a car pile-up on the freeway and his partner is having a heated argument with an Asian woman. The scene changes and we see two relatively well-dressed, young African- Americans, having an intelligent conversation about racism. They are walking through a predominately white upper-class suburb in L.A., one of the men observe that the white people around them appear to be scared of them, and that they are the one's who should be scared, when the other asks, ""So why aren't we scared?"" ""Because we have guns!"" Suddenly both pull out pistols and commit a car jacking, the victims just happen to be the District Attorney of L.A. and his wife.

The story continues focusing on the lives of a Persian storeowner and his family, an African-American television director and his beautiful wife; a Mexican American locksmith; a racist cop and his rookie partner and a Korean couple whose activities in the film is revealed at the end and is quite surprising.

Paul Haggis wrote and directed this film and cleverly connects the characters lives, where their individual actions, either directly or indirectly has a great effect on their respective views of themselves and the people around them. In other words, despite living behind ""glass and steel"", our lives are destined to collide.

As I believe this film is a realistic view of modern urban life, for the most part, however, is a tragedy, because despite existing side by side, we continue to be alienated, though connected as human beings, affecting each other personally, and forced to communicate only through fear, violence and...unexpected collision.

Crash is an excellent film.",1137024000,,2862,4.9916142557651995
2359742,4,B000A3XY5A,"Causality at it's best.  Unlike some of it's critics I do not believe that this movie was stereotypical. I do believe it pointed out that prejudices and racism can be found in the rich and affluent, the hardworking and disgruntled, and the poor and disenfranchised. In my opinion this movie questions stereotypes rather than implies them. For instance the crooked cop who fundles a man's wife before his very eyes character seems cold and heartless with no redeemable qualities. But once you realize that he has a sick and obstinate father at home that he cares for he starts to become almost human again. And then when you think about the fact that right before he harassed this couple he had just gotten off the phone with a (black) woman who had the power in her hands to help him with his father's condition but all she did was react insensitively to his request. You may come to the conclusion that part of the reason that he behaved so ""badly"" to say the very least, was because of his sick father, and the reason he took it out on this black man and his wife was because ""Sheniqua"" played by Loretta Devine was black and in a position of power yet, she reacted merciless in a situation where he was powerless. Near the end of this movie as fate would have it he would be put in a position to help the woman that he hurt. And when his own life is put at risk he saves her, his character has now been redeemed from demonic to human status again. This movie causes you to question what you know about others and what do you know about yourself. The good cop (a young rookie) is so repulsed by  the veteran cop, that he determines in his mind to do the total opposite. He goes out of his way to save an armed black man and to keep him from being arrested, But toward the end of the movie he kills a man who doesn't even have a weapon. He then dumps the body in an open field. Who would have thought that the good cop would have become a murderer and the bad cop would have become a hero? Again I ask, What do you know about yourself? What do you know about others.",1137024000,,2067,4.243654822335025

It's funny but  last semester one of my instructors decided to show ""Crash"" to the entire class because she thought it would be a ""good learning tool"" about how racism affects the lives of everybody. Of course everyone in the class was eager to see it- anything but hearing a lecture. So after the movie was over, everyone in the class talked about how deep the movie was and that the movie made them more aware of racism. First of all, this movie was about exaggerated stereotypes and I don't know how anyone could learn about racism by watching a Hollywood film  within the protective walls of a classroom. If my classmates wanted to learn more about racism, all they needed to do was go volunteer or work  for 1+ years in a minority community and talk with the people. But no- it's soooo much easier to watch ""Crash"" and then say you've been enlightened to the evils of racism. ""Crash"" was a waste of time and the only scene I liked was when Sandra Bullock fell down the steps. This movie is not deep- skip it.",1136937600,17,1182,4.462962962962963

This movie is about racism; it is about self blinding misconceptions and it is about the blinding pain that all of that causes.  It is also about acts of selflessness,courage,and human compassion demonstrated by  characters that we thought we had pegged as lacking in the capacity to demonstrate all of these virtues.  Don Cheadle is incredible in this movie.  I have always felt that his talent has not been sufficiently recognized.  He does an outstanding job with quiet dignity and understatement; exactly what his role called for...Absolutely fantastic movie: beautiful musical score, excellent direction.

2359748,3,B000A3XY5A,"CRASH explores racial animosity in present-day Los Angeles. We have Chinese, blacks, hispanic, whites and Middle Eastern types, many angry, some afraid of being mugged or killed or robbed, some waiting for another gunshot to come through the wall of their home. Behind all this emotional turmoil is race. There is the cop who abuses blacks because of affirmative action, the thug who car jacks whites only because of perceived white prejudice toward blacks, the Persian shopkeeper who hates hispanics because his store is burgled. And there are Chinese angry at whites for some unknown reason. At some point you feel like Rodney King and want to shout, ""Why can't we all just get along?"" CRASH implies that this is the way LA is and, by extension, the rest of the US. CRASH also seems to provide excuses for all this hate and criminal activity, the primary excuse being the effects of society on people. In other words, people have no individual responsibility; the devil (society) made them do it. I say bull dookie to this thesis. A cop should control his emotions and car jackers are thugs, not oppressed minorities, and America is NOT like this movie. The screenplay allows almost every character to perform an act of redemptive kindness or courage and that makes some characters more human or likeable but only adds to the film's overall shroud of moral ambiguity. Now that we have dealt with the film's political message, let's look at the film as art. I found CRASH to be well-made and entertaining, the acting quite good and the script tight and suspenseful with authentic-sounding dialogue. Matt Dillion, Sandra Bullock and other excellent actors flesh out this effort directed by Paul Haggis. I wouldn't recommend this as a date flick because it is a bit of a downer. Obviously, there are people who think and behave the way they do in CRASH and that is a shame but don't let CRASH infect you with pessimism about America -- even if it is a pretty good film.",1136505600,2,1968,4.774193548387097

Instead, it offers you each persons story, and you begin to piece together how they all ""crash"" together (that didn't ruin anything, I promise).

Crash deals with racism through the eyes of many different people. Not only do we see racism through the eyes of the race we are probably affiliated with, but through many others in this move. True, it's not as racially intense as American History X, it will still affect you the same way.

When Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) carjack the District Attorney's (Brendan Fraser) SUV, his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) goes on a racial tear to justify her own depression. Daniel (Michael Pena) is a quiet, polite Hispanic locksmith who finds aggression from a Persian family who loses everything in a store robbery he tried to prevent. And Graham (Don Cheadle) is an African-American detective looking for his lost little brother, forced to use his skin color to tow the company line when corruption rears its head in the department.

Last year, writer Paul Haggis left audiences thunderstruck by the power of his screen writing adaptation of the heartfelt Oscar winner, ""Million Dollar Baby."" With ""Crash,"" Haggis returns behind the camera (after years of television work), and once again delivers a masterful movie-going experience.

While covering a multitude of arguments and ideas, Haggis's theme for ""Crash"" centers on the thought of faulty human communication; the film suggests that people have grown cold to affection and respect, instead immediately using hatred and paranoia as a way of communicating with their fellow man, almost always with disastrous consequences. The L.A. backdrop to the film explores the intense racial loathing and confusion that plagues the city, and while I'm not a fan of using the tired metropolis as a location for any film, ""Crash"" almost couldn't be set anywhere else. The setting has just the right melting pot flashpoint posture to sell this seething tale, instilling the film with a realistic take on racial claustrophobia. Like many films, ""Crash"" makes Los Angeles look like hell on Earth. Yet, Haggis doesn't give in to that fear, and manages to find a palpable sense of hope behind the shattering of cultures and furious intolerance.

The magic of ""Crash"" is that it balances melodrama and realism in a seamless way. Haggis and his brilliant cast often perform loudly and uncomfortably to generate the sickening feeling of despair that is being sought by the filmmaker. This is a film that deals with blinding rage, and while the story dangerously straddles the line between cartoonish and insightful, Haggis never lets the tone out of his control. He keeps the truth of the situation bubbling behind every scene, and exploits the audiences' own personal prejudices with his scripted moments of aggravation, bitterness, and incorrect racial assignment. These characters aren't simply evil people, just products of their environment, family, and frustrations; they ache in very human ways to connect and protect, but are stunted by their own fears and anger. Haggis's script marvelously connects the stories through an oft-used multi-character, crisscross structure (a favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson and Robert Altman), but the cinematic showiness of the associations found in the film are erased instantaneously by the emotional wallop the movie routinely delivers.

As the film moves along (quite swiftly too), ""Crash"" grows stronger and stronger, until it feels that the screen has become one with the audience. I dare anyone not to recoil in horror as Jean yells about the untrustworthiness of a Mexican handyman, or as Anthony decries the negative Caucasian viewpoint of African-Americans while carjacking any automobile he can. In addition, some in the audience might need heart medication after witnessing Daniel and his angelic daughter at the business end of a gun in the picture's best sequence. The events in ""Crash"" roll forward without stopping, at times unbearably, yet they register strongly with their frankness and integrity. The honesty might be uncomfortable to watch, but through Haggis's careful vision, the picture cannot be easily dismissed.

""Crash"" isn't a simple film to digest, and with its uncomfortable ideas of intolerance and resentment, it also won't be a film completely accepted either. However, for a minuscule production, this is a masterpiece of substantial proportions. In the glut of summer product, ""Crash"" an easy film to miss.

2359764,5,B000A3XY5A,"My friends have been telling me I should see this film since it was released last spring.  Katrina showed us that racism was alive and well in our country, but this film said it first.

The story is another six degrees of separation situation with characters of several ethnic backgrounds.  The performances are excellent.  Sandra Bullock who has been given much too little chance to show her true dramatic acting skills gives a finely detailed performance as a spoiled upper class woman whose world is being attacked by the foreigners but who finds in the end that it is the foreigners who are her friends and the ones she can trust.

Matt Dillon continues to get better and better with each role.  His performance as a policeman whose life trying to help his retired ailing father is making so him so angry that he takes it out on everyone he meets on the job.  His arguments with his father's HMO, and the overworked doctor assigned to his father will bring recognition to those of us who have been in this position.  I can only hope Dillon will finally win an Oscar one of these days.  Don Cheatle is there playing a police detective torn between his job and his dysfunctional family, and Thandie Newton gives yet one more excellent performance as an African American wife whose first encounter with Dillon's racist policeman is followed by a second where each of them learns things about the other which turns each into a human being instead of a stereotype.  Finally, Ryan Phillippe plays a rookie cop who learns, the hard way, that you shouldn't judge someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes.

This film shows that the good guys and the bad guys are not always evident at first glance.  It also shows that a good turn will be remembered and may cause someone to act against their own interests because of it.

The whites are afraid of the blacks and think the hispanics with tattoos are hoodlums.  The blacks think that the whites are ""the man"" and that everyone is out to oppress them.  Everyone thinks arabs are terrorists...and on it goes.

My biggest problem with this movie is it fails to deliver on its promises. Though it clearly depicts current race issues, Crash falls short of its apparent purpose--a solution to the desperation. The movie causes us to cry out in anguish as we sit between ethnicities, wondering how the stories will resolve themselves, but we are given no way out. Instead of a message of redemption, we see (what may be) a reality we are powerless to change. If that's the truth, why bring these issues to our attention?

2359770,4,B000A3XY5A,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I'd heard the noise around it and thought it seemed too similar to Short Cuts, Grand Canyon, Magnolia sort of films. I've always kind of liked those and kinda had problems with them. I expected the same with this one, but it actually holds together with an original, honest and believable take on the present state of race relations in America.

But, having said that, this works because the focus remains with the individual characters. They're all believable. Their flaws are credible. Their prejudices are not without merit. That's one of the things that makes this good. It doesn't try to say that anybody who has a racist thought is awful. That sort of simplification is why we never get anywhere. It's much more interesting to let believable characters say things that many people think but rarely say in public. I do think, however, that people say an awful lot of things in the privacy of their own home, with a spouse, or when they're one on one with somebody who doesn't have the power to call them on their racism. This happens. This film, fortunately, lets us glimpse moments like these.

I read some of the negative reviews below mine. Many of them seem like the thoughts of people who had their minds made up before ever seeing the movie. The sort of points they make are the easy ones that you can come to the film suspecting. Don't let them sway you if you have an open mind, however.

2359790,4,B000A3XY5A,"This is one of the lastest films that focuses on the issue of race.  Other reviewers have explained very well who the characters are and give good overviews on what kinds of things happen in this film so I won't repeat what was said and will concentrate on what I've got out of this film.

Although I don't regard this film as a masterpiece, it's one of the more poignant films I've seen on the issue of race in a long time.  It's not as poignant as ""American History X"" but I think it's a film that makes us think more about how we perceive things.  All of the characters in this film who seemed to espouse certain extreme views all had very serious problems that they were dealing with in their personal lives.  ""Misery loves company"" and race is one of those things that seem to empower different people.  The film showed that when many of us feel weak, vulnerable, impotent, hurt, etc. we look for things to impower us which so many times happens to be race.  Which leads me to the premise that people who are truely happy with themselves and their lives have no reason to show any animosity towards anyone or anything.  There was one character in this film who seem to have that quality.

It's healthy to stand up for injustice, but when one just does things with the intention to hurt somebody because they are hurt, it becomes counter productive.  Mean-spirited and spiteful attacks (whether verbal or physical) do nothing but show others how miserable the perpetrators are.  We must constantly remind ourselves that there is nothing empowering about resorting to physical or verbal violence when we can't deal with our own problems.  In fact, it's my opinion that one who resorts to mean-spirited and spiteful attacks show not only that they are very miserable people, but that they are also impotent (no pun intended, but that may very well be the case as well :-) ).",1135296000,,1876,4.583832335329341
2359791,4,B000A3XY5A,"With no leads, Crash fills the screen with a seemingly endless string of fantastic supporting characters, all linked together by some form of crisis.  Harboring racist views toward others groups (or their own) seems to be another tie that binds them together, in this film that exposes stereotypes across nearly every ethnic group.

Whites, blacks, Latinos, Arabs, Asians, rich, poor, etc.  All classes and races are covered, and everyone is depicted as being unforgiving and unaccommodating to those outside of their own group.  Crash attempts to show that everyone is somehow a victim of racism and also a propitiator of it.

The most memorable characters among the ensemble cast include Matt Dillon as a cop who does a good job explaining the pragmatic reasons behind his racism and Don Cheadle as a detective trying to do right by his drug-inflicted family.  Those are only two of the remarkable performances by a cast that should (in a just world) receive the majority of the supporting acting nominations this year.  From top to bottom, the cast is that good.  But the number of great performances will probably cancel each other out, leaving Crash unjustly underrepresented during the awards season.

At times, the film is a ""one trick pony"", as it seems to only be about race.  It becomes a bit unbelievable, because racist assumptions and beliefs drive every major plotline.  At some point, the viewer should begin to wonder if there isn't more to these people than just their races and their views of other races.  Doesn't conflict and drama result from ""other"" things?

With that said, Crash is one of the most innovative and intriguing films of the year.  Some of the highest praise I can see comes from the desire to faithfully depict the races.  Black viewers will think blacks are unfairly depicted, whites will think whites are unfairly depicted, etc.  So, since no group is proud of the behavior of their own race, the film probably has it about right.

Each plotline contains high drama and rewarding resolution, but the film offers little direction on how to solve the problems it identifies.  Rather than giving answers, Crash tries to be a wake-up call to viewers, displaying how the world suffers because of our inability to get along.",1135123200,4,2257,4.925925925925926

When I saw many of the scenes in this movie, I was taken back to many different times when I personaly encountered something close to those kinds of stressful situations.  I even heard many minorities telling me stories about theses kinds of similurar situations that they encountered.  Unless you have been in their shoes, don't automatically accuse people of this country, both majorities and minorities of being ignorant of racisim.  Now, I'm not saying that one m inority faces racsism everyday of his/her life, but the minorities do encouter racisism in this country, just like I'm sure some of the majorities have encountered some stressful situtuations that were similure (I'm not saying exactly like the movie) in this movie.  The reivewer who wrote ""have some good acting but that's all"", made me upset when he stated that he was sick and tired of this kind of movies, and that he did not needed to be reminded of racisism.  He even go far to be nasty by demeaning people who bought this movie.  It's one thing to not like how the movie was put together.  You can think that maybe the dialog in this movie was to harsh or something of that line, but go go far as what these two reviewers said, it makes me very angry!  What makes me even more angrier was that, there were plenty of comercials and trailers that were shown for this movie.  I knew what this movie was about before renting it, so why did these two reviewers who sounds like they don't like to rent these kinds of ""makes you think"" movie even see this film?  What I liked about this movie was that it was not about black people vs white people.  Lot of times when people refer to minorities, it seems like they picture blacks and whites.  But, this film covered almost all groups including whites.  We got to see it from everyone's perspective.  I especially liked towards end involving the guy with a gun and the locksmith with a kid.  This film in my eyes is not a perfect film.  Could this film be made better, well of course it could have made better.  But, overall I think the director did a super job with the actors, actresses and the script.  The reviewer ""has good acting but that's it"", even slambed the actors and actersses saying that they made this film to make a bundle of money. I thought what he said was just so stupid!  If he does not want the celebrarities to make money doing their job, then he can stop renting videos, going to movies or buy DVDs from now on.  This way, he can make sure that none of his money goes to actors and actresses.  I have never heard of any actors and actresses that stars in movies that don't make money.  May be these two reviewers should stick with movies that are more of a nonbrainer like The Blob or Waynes World.  I didn't like some of the scenes in this movie, but overall this film is a great film for those who knows what to get out of it.  This film is definately not for everyone, but I for one glade that I've seen it.  This film, especially scenes that involed that little girl and the locksmith really warmed my heart.",1135036800,,4384,4.367901234567901
2359793,5,B000A3XY5A,"WOW! I haven't wrote a film review since March or April of 2005 because I've seen some good movies but they did not move me as much as this one!

Thank you thank you thank you! To all the writers, directors, producers, actors and anyone involved in this film and to God (seriously) for giving them such inspiration, wisdom and guidance on a delicate topic made so amazingly geniously! This film is truly, a MUST see, just as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" is one of those types, so is this one! Everyone over the age of 18 needs to see this! As a latino guy in this world, it moved me so much because this film so discretely and powerfully echoes the sentiments, experiences of myself and of us all no matter what your race is. Although this movie is fiction, it is an essential reality in our world that is played out in such a gut wrenchingly beautiful and soul-moving way. I cried after this movie was over and I'm sure many minorites seeing this will have this peaceful feeling come over them inside their heart. If you are a minority, everything you have ever grown up with and felt and everything that has ever nagged at you in the pit of your stomach as it relates to race relations, is poured out unapologetically from its heart and soul in this film.

Because of this movie, I will never be the same again.",1134864000,3,1307,4.374485596707819

Good acting notwithstanding, more anger, more racism, more random violence in the name of ""art"" means megabucks for the actors, producers, etc. but no answers for the greater good of society.

Even from Sandra Bullock, she seems to act like an air head in most of the movies she's in, but in this movie I thought she did a pretty good job.  Now, there were some reviewers that critcize this movie here and there, but overall I'm glade that I saw this movie.  Sure, the script could have been better, but I think the director was trying to get a message across.  The message is that all of us, no matter what race, sex or age need to be more sensitive to others around us.  We need to watch what we say and what we do.  Spoiler ahead!  And, don't just jump to conclusions about things, hence towards the last part of the movie about a lock smith and the guy who blamed him for the robbery (this was my favorite part), and went to the lock smith house to kill him. This movie may not have been scripted perfectly, but I highly respect the director and producer for having the guts to put this movie out, and putting out a message that ofcourse this was nothing we have not heard or seen before, but putting out the message to just remind us to just watch how we treat one another.  Great movie!  Worth seeing!",1134691200,2,1432,4.170909090909091
2359798,4,B000A3XY5A,"Crash serves up 31 flavors of racism via interlocking vignettes recounting two days in the lives of very different complete strangers.  I was a little leery of this film going in, partly because I don't particularly care for some of the cast members and partly because the prospects of making a serious film about racism without resorting to stereotypes or preaching to the audience seemed rather low.  I needn't have worried.  Sure, Sandra Bullock annoyed the heck out of me every second she was on the screen, but the movie works - powerfully and effectively.  The secret would seem to be a complete disregard for political correctness.  If you want to say something about racism, you can't dance around the issue, and thankfully the writer of this film knew that.

I won't go into much detail about the plot or the characters, except to say that a wide range of races and cultures are represented here - and the racism that is portrayed on screen works both ways.  Furthermore, the characters are by no means stereotypical and often do things you don't really expect them to do.  There was a time or two when I said to myself that no one would ever come out and say what a particular character just said, but maybe I'm wrong about that.  Those lines, though, show just how foolish and ugly racism is.  To some extent, we can at least see where a few characters are coming from, thanks to little references back to experiences they've had.  I think the real strength of the story, though, is the level of nuance built into these vignettes.  Consciously doing certain things in order not to appear racist, for purely personal reasons of self-interest, is no better than committing an overt act of prejudice, and this film brings that fact out rather effectively.  It also reminds us that even the most hateful of men and women are still human beings with their own problems.

There are some pretty powerful moments spread throughout this film: the heroics of an otherwise hateful cop and the angelic little girl scenes, for example, give us moments of pure cinematic magic.  Other moments surprise us, effectively denying us the ability to ever get truly comfortable with what we are seeing onscreen.  Lives are changed, some for better, some for worse - and the mixed signals at the end really just reinforce the points the story was trying to make.  Are these temporary changes?  Will life just go on as it always has, tainted by hate and mutual suspicion?  Any movie that leaves you asking such poignant questions has to be called a real success.",1134172800,3,2550,4.715575620767495

2359821,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a very aggressive look at Race Relations 2004 in Los Angeles.  It's an ensemble piece with the various races represented, a number of the characters in the police department or city government.  These stories of the naked city have been tried before by John Sayles in Lonestar, with a much lighter note, LA Story, 1991 with Steve Martin, or Lawrence Kasdan's, Grand Canyon, 1991 (also with the LA motif).  All these films rely on the interactions of diverse peoples that normally would not come into contact with each other except for the imagination of the screenwriter. Everything works as long as the viewer goes along with the string of coincidences.  Coincidence is actually what makes most stories, stories, but woe if the writer overdoes it.  La Story and Grand Canyon work, but Lonestar and Crash do not.

Paul Haggis wants very much to get at the nature of racial tensions and prejudice.  His avalanche of coincidences crisscross our moonscape of an LA inhabited by folks that seemed to be armed to the teeth.  That's the main tension.  Who is gonna shoot who?  Since all have a beef with society for one reason or other, who is gonna get it?

Spare me from gangbangers that sound like Bobby Seal, the Black Panther loony that went up for murdering his white, old lady secretary.  She knew too much.  Don't act like the glory days of Black Power were so special when there is much evidence that militancy catalyzes murder and poverty.  Then we have upper-crusty black women chastising a film director, a soft-spoken black man because he doesn't protect her from the sleazy Matt Dillion cop. Just deball a fellow and see what happens ladies.  That's not race relations; that's ball busting.

There are a baker's dozen story lines, too many to comment on all, but why do these films always end with a look into the sunset or a bizarre LA snowfall. Don't you see, ""we is all gods childrens master Haggis.",1133913600,,1919,4.717717717717718

The movie was entertaining but I certainly didn't feel that it warrants the credit being attributed to it. I certainly didn't need to see this movie to encompass all it entails. Everyone is racist. Racism, contrary to popular belief, is not a white vs. minorities issue. Further into the movie, I thought the connection that Matt Dillon's character had with the black woman was cheezy and way too predictable. What also didn't impress me is how, in the end, it reverts back to the white man being the ""bad guy"" (boy you don't see that in Hollywood do you???).

2359823,5,B000A3XY5A,"Canadian screenwriter Paul Haggis has proven his superior writing abilities with the Oscar-winning ""Million Dollar Baby,"" and now those wares extend at directing after helming the exceptional ""Crash,"" his feature directorial debut. A multi-layered tale about simmering racism in Los Angeles, the picture features exceptional performances and an involving script.

One night two black men, Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate) carjack the SUV of District Attorney Rick (Brendan Fraser) and his uptight wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). At home, Jean voices her suspicions regarding the honesty of the Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena) who returns home to his young daughter upset and frustrated. Meanwhile white cops Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Hanson (Ryan Phillippe) stop what they believe is the stolen SUV and harass black couple, Cameron (Terrence Howard), a troubled TV director, and spoiled wife Christine (Thandie Newton). The narrative thread then leads to detective Walters (Don Cheadle) who's trying to find his brother, Peter, who gets into trouble again after car-jacking a suicidal Cameron. Meanwhile Daniel has fresh problems when confronted by suspicious Iranian storeowner Farhad (Shaun Toub) that leads to one of the tensest sequences in the movie.

Though the ""race"" card is played almost ad nauseam, ""Crash"" is thrilling and convincing. Of course, with a cast that boosts Cheadle, Howard, Tate, Dillon and Newton and my fave rapper of the 'mo, Ludacris - all of who deliver powerful performances - it's hard not to be impressed.

2359825,5,B000A3XY5A,"Being, myself, a person born and raised in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles (where a good deal of Crash takes place), I must report that: it isn't this bad. We don't rush around here from one racial conflict to the next, really we don't.

But Crash isn't concerned with being realistic, or a slice of life. Crash is a film designed to talk about racism, or, rather, to bring racism up, shove our faces in it, and force *us* to talk about it. And it does that very well.

Crash brings together characters of different backgrounds and ethnicities whose lives only briefly intersect; usually, when they do, they react to one another based on the most easily noticable differences--race. The movie is well-acted, well-written and well-directed. You might think that--well, it's about racism, so I know that it's going to be straight-forward and present racists as evil and the oppressed as heroic, etc. But, it's not so. Crash has a great deal more sophistication than that, as displayed in the very opening scene where two young black males are complaining how people act afraid of them just because they're young black males... just before they carjack a passing couple. Surprises abound in this movie, and everyone is shown to have virtues and flaws.

I've noted that some earlier reviewers complain of the ""preachiness"" of the film, but I can't disagree more. Crash doesn't tell us what to do--it doesn't tell us who is right, who wrong, or even why. It simply says ""we have a problem and it looks like: *this*"" and then leaves us to sort it all out.

And because it does this in an inventive, enjoyable and compelling way, I say it is a great film.",1133481600,,1655,4.676975945017182

It also has all the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer to the head.  It's a Very Serious Film meant to enlighten the ignorant masses.

  Ham-fisted and tiresome, this movie is nothing more than a series of connected events created to manipulate the viewer to think and feel exactly what the filmmakers want you to think and feel.  It's truly insulting when a filmmaker decides the audience is too stupid to think for themselves.  God forbid we should draw our own conclusions about what transpires on the screen before us.  So what we are treated with is a forced, contrived and cloying script that bludgeons us with its Really Important Message.

  The actors do the best they can with the script and rise above the unforgivable mess that was handed to them, notably Sandra Bullock.  In the hands of a lesser actor her character could have easily been played as a histrionic caricature.  Bullock expertly tones it down and gives us a great performance.

  In my mind Crash is worse than garbage like Armageddon and its ilk, simply because those kind of movies don't have lofty goals and don't pretend to be anything other than what they are, i.e. mindless entertainment.  With Crash, writer/director Paul Haggis actually thinks he has something important to say about racial stereotypes and discrimination.

What is even more remarkable is that it manages to do this in a film that is, at its heart, concerned with racism and tribalism (the latter term seeming to be a more precise description of the film's subject matter).  That the film rises above the inherent toxicity of its subject matter as well as the urge to interpret things via a simplistic calculus is commendable.  It is also produces a rivetting and fascinating narrative that follows an ensemble cast through 24 hours or so of life in Los Angeles, as characters alternate between brushing past one another, guided by stereotypes and preconceptions, or interact on deeper levels that recognize common humanity.  The film, understandably, suggests the latter is preferable, but it avoids the pitfall of being trite with its characters and their actions, instead consistently showing a real and fascinating complexity of character and situation.

Highly recommended for anyone seeking a thought provoking, character-driven film.",1133049600,6,1233,5.270408163265306
2359851,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is an intelligent film that not only examines several facets of racism, but of racial identity as well. It causes the viewers to take a look into their own stereotypes and expectations. Each interweaving situation has touching, provocative, and even funny moments. Set in Los Angeles, several identities are presented in Crash:  how blacks, whites, Arabs (or in this case, Persians assumed to be Arab) Asians, and Hispanics all perceive each other.  It looks into race-fueled issues on small scales (like associations to the name ""Shaniqua"") to large scales, such as terrorism and affirmative action.

The cast includes familiar names such as Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Ludacris, and Ryan Phillpe, as well as some lesser-known faces like Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard, all who give top-notch performances.

Now granted, coincidences in Crash get a little too common and *too* coincidental--for such a whopping city like L.A., events tend to get conveniently linked. Theoretically the person you hurt one day could be the person you save the next, but such flukes pop up all over the city on this particular day. But I don't think this pattern devalues the film. It's necessary to make the events condensed into a small time frame, or else things would get tiresome fast.

This movie takes us to the racism-flourished neighborhoods of Los Angeles (in the same veign as American History X, another great movie) and we meet all our characters in about 30 minutes. From there on, we watch as one event to another connects them all. The racism in this film is used a lot, but only because it has to be. It is involved in all the character's lives, and there are sometimes when we understand it, and others when we feel like smacking the person in the face.

The movie really puts racial issues in your face, making you take a hard look at them and yourself.  it is a movie best watched with others, because the minute it gets over you will need to discuss what you have just seen.

Predjudices, judgements, past experiences, instincts, and what you think to be the truth all come into play as you follow police men, a DA, shopowners, locksmiths and everyday people around for 2 days.

2359856,5,B000A3XY5A,"This is a great film which I would strongly recommend. It is actually a very brave film because it is willing to deal with the issues of racial tension, bias and stereotyping, and the violence that can result.

There are several important themes and I want to comment on several of them.

First, violence comes in many shapes. This film does a wonderful job of showing the range of violence.  We see violence to self in an addicted African American mother who can't control her teenage son. We see homicidal violence when an Iranian almost kills a little Latina girl or when an off-duty Anglo police officer accidentally kills an adolescent African American car thief. We see everyday violence when an African American claims agent for an HMO refuses to help an elderly white man in pain because his racist son gets confrontive with her. We see deep long lasting violence as this police officer humiliates a wealthy African American TV executive and his wife, putting a strain on their relationship that could end their marriage. Sandra Bullock plays a cold upper-class woman who commits violence through class oppression and demeaning comments to her well-meaning Latina maid. A group of Chinese illegal immigrants are left for hours in a locked truck and are almost sold as slaves. A public relations campaign manager is willing to frame a white police officer for murder of an off-duty crack using Black police officer to make the district attorney look pro-Black by prosecuting him. Violence can be planned or spontaneous. Violence can be overt or covert. Violence can be against the body or the soul. Violence can be against an individual or a people. This film is full of violence, showing some of the roots and some of the consequences.

Second, we resort to stereotypes when we are under pressure. Matt Dillion is almost crazy with concern for his elderly father in chronic pain who can't get proper services from his HMO, so he erupts at the African American claims officer and when he is shut off, he seeks revenge on a wealthy Black couple. Shaun Toub plays an Iranian shop keeper who when vandalized with anti-Islamic graphetti and loses his business, attempts to kill the Latino locksmith with whom he argued the day before. Ryan Phillippe pays a liberal police officer who panics and kills an adolescent Black delinquent he picked up as a hitch hiker.

Third, life catches us sometimes at our best and sometimes at our worst. Matt Dillion and Terrance Dashon Howard are incredible actors as they show this in a white police officer and a Black TV executive. Dillion gropes Howard's beautiful wife after stopping them for no reason - demeaning the husband in front of his wife and demeaning the wife in front of the husband. However later, Dillion rescues the wife, Thandie Newton, from a burning car, putting his own life at risk. Howard absorbs the insult of seeing his wife groped but is driven to the edge by his TV show Director (Tony Lanza)and then finally goes over the edge when two Black car thieves try to car jack him. Ryan Phillippe is caught at his best, resisting his police partner's influence and calming Howard down when he has become homicidal with rage. Yet even Ryan, set up as a liberal clear headed hero, commits a terrible accidental crime becuase of snap judgement assumptions.

Fourth, the film tells us we can be at our best when we work across the sterotype and attribute goodness and badness to individuals at specific points in time, not to entire lives and to entire races or peoples.

I gave this film 5 stars for outright bravery.",1132444800,8,3575,4.7938311688311686
2359857,3,B000A3XY5A,"The first half of ""Crash"" features several interconnected vignettes of LA-style racism and racial tension that are so interesting and disturbing that it's a particular shame when the film later confirms itself as a heavy-handed ironic morality play. There are small signs of the screenwriter's heavy (white) hand early in the movie, in the overwritten lines of a young black carjacker, in the overheated rant of the DA's wife as she suspects her locksmith of being a Latino gangbanger (but who, needless to say, turns out to be a saint), and in the motivations of a racist cop for pulling over and humiliating a rich, smartly dressed couple for DWB--driving while black.

But the writing is smart and every scene feels real enough until the arrival of Ironic Moral Twist number one: the racist cop has to rescue someone from an overturned car that's leaking gasoline and about to explode, and it's the black woman he pulled over and molested the night before. The woman has to put aside her revulsion and let the racist pig save her.

The woman's husband gets jacked by the same pan-Los Angeles carjacking team featured earlier but he refuses to comply and ends up in a showdown with police that's defused by the rookie former partner of the racist cop, in the most unlikely scene since O.J. went looking for the real killers. The rich husband then admonishes one of the carjackers for embarrassing the entire black race and lets him go. The rookie cop later mistakenly shoots one of the carjackers dead. Leaden ironies like this pile up like fender benders on the 405 and slow the movie down accordingly, tempting one to pull over to the diamond lane of the fast-forward button.

The style and structure of ""Crash"" strongly resemble ""Traffic,"" another ""issue"" movie that focused on the drug problem, and it shows some of the same stylistic refinement. But while ""Traffic"" also indulged in unlikely irony for dramatic effect, it was more nuanced and believable, and had much less stage-play artifice.",1132358400,6,2000,4.876470588235295
2359878,4,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is basically a film that pretends to be more important than it really is, and that's the one big flaw that hindered my enjoyment of it. It really is a very well made drama, and an impressive directorial debut from Haggis, who obviously learned a lot from his collaborative work with Clint Eastwood - Crash is nearly as dark and gritty as anything the master had done. A cast of second rate Hollywood stars and B-list character actors - which includes Matt Dillon (who hadn't had a truly impressive dramatic role in more than a decade), Don Cheadle (who made his breakthrough the very same year with Hotel Rwanda), Brandon Frasier and Sandra Bullock among many others works surprisingly well together, and the film is a strong and professionally made drama with some very good dialogue and excellent atmospheric cinematography.

Crash is good, but it doesn't have what it takes to be truly great, and I wouldn't take anyone calling it one of the most important films of the year very seriously. The Altman-ish mish-mash of characters whose separate stories interact in surprising ways has become overtly fashionable in Hollywood in recent years, and sometimes it seems to me like the main objective is to avoid the nuisance of developing interesting individual characters; in fact, not one character in Crash - including Cheadle's and Dillon's, both of whom give undeniably remarkable performances - is interesting enough to be considered a main character, and I found myself completely detached from all of them. The film tries to get across a message about the racial tension in America - and some of the images and stories are definitely shocking, moving and effective, but the message is ultimately vague, and it often seems like a pale and weak imitation of Spike Lee. At any rate it never at any moment manages to be half as powerful and potent as anything Spike had made.

Crash is definitely a good drama that's worth your time, but it's not one of the best or most interesting films of the year. At its best it's as good as the weakest of Clint Eastwood's films - and if you've watched his films then you know that's high praise. Don't believe the hype; Crash is a very good film but it's no news. If you hated Magnolia, 21 Grams or anything of that genre then you're not likely to get that much out of Crash either.",1132272000,,2330,4.708333333333333
2359879,4,B000A3XY5A,"This film is interesting in the questions it raises. How do different races get along? If we are to start from a self-oriented humanistic base, why should an individual treat their ""enemies"" nicely as opposed to violently? How do we deal with retaliation and the attitudes the go along with it?

The portraits in human encountered are carefully placed to give great thought-proving imagery. This film could be used for starting some interesting dialog in relation to racial reconcilliation.

I think this film might be a catalyst in getting people think seriously about various things, such as: violence, racism, sterotypes, human relations, and whether their worldview provides a proper basis for morality and humaness",1132012800,,719,5.298245614035087
2359880,5,B000A3XY5A,"Wow....wow. Finally saw this film. It is not hard to follow at all. People talk too much when they watch movies with friends, and they eat popcorn crunch crunch, and leave to use the restroom (at theatre's), so i do recommend watching any film alone at least once for the first time. This film to me was pretty good. There are three categories that movies fall into, a). alright but not worth seeing twice. b) entertaining somewhat, but after it's over you're say that wasn't that good. and c) you enjoy it, at the end you say wow that was really good probably will watch it again. C is this film to me. What i like most about it, is there are many surprises, and it's not very predictable. It gets intense, and you think something awful is going to happen but something different occurs which suprises you. Also, last but not least, it seemed like the apparent bad people turned out to be good, and the good people turned out to be bad, not everyone but most. It's just like that saying ""sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to help you get back up"" And also never judge a book by it's cover. And when i mean intense, by the time this film ended, i was sweating. That is intense. Yeah some of the racist scenes were a little exagerated, but that was on purpose to prove a point. And the dirctors love this kind of order of scenes in films these days. The kind where there are several mini stories, and they all come together towards the end so that it makes more sense, and you find out who's who to everyone. The acting was pretty dam good. I love sandra bullok, and that scene where her maid was helping her with her leg, i thought to myself, see ""she's"" there for you! give her a hug, and she did. There was only two predictable parts. the one i just said, and the car accident in which the cop saves the same woman he groped on ths street. i knew it would be her. There were some sad parts, but this is a touching film that really gets to you, and has a good message. Great drama!",1131926400,,2026,4.224226804123711
2359881,5,B000A3XY5A,"Wow, just finished watching Crash for the second time, and let me tell you, the effect this movie had on me was just as strong if not stronger then my initial viewing. The emotional punch this delivers reminds me and restores me faith in thinking that movies like this can still be made. The performances are flawless, (even Sandra Bullock, who I generally can't stand) the plot weaves in and out perfectly and the soundtrack is devastating.

Racism is a scary thing, and this movie amazingly gives you all the myths, hype, violence, and stereo-types we've all come to hear about these days. But it also smacks you right in the face when you see the after-math of all types of racism. It chills me to the bone to think this is going on in our own backyards.

Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillpe, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Ludacris, and many, many more absolutely mesmerize with there performances. First time director Haggis has me anxiously awaiting his sophmore effort, I hope its very soon.

I hope when Oscar time rolls around this movie is not forgotten, I can think of atleast 6 categories it should not only be nominated in, but also winning. The first time I saw this was in the theater and the crowd was stunned. Half of them were either shaking there heads in amazement or crying there eyes out. Please watch this movie, especially if you find yourself questioning your faith in color, sex, or family.

  Crash is a movie whose tagline describes the movie perfectly.  ""You think you know who you are.  You have no idea.""  Unless you know where someone is coming from, you can never truly know them.  If you don't know other people, you can't really know yourself.  I think this movie is trying to teach us this lesson.  What factos actually defines who a person is, anyway?

  I took off half star for overusing racial slurs.  I beleive most racism these days is more covert and implicit.  I thought it detracted from the realism a bit.

  Great soundtrack and cameras.  I think this is a great movie if you want something that will force you to question yourself and the world you live in.",1131667200,,777,4.390070921985815

Superbly written and acted, it manages to deftly handle controversial themes such as racism, death, despair, ambition and redemption without ever becoming maudlin or boring.  It is a haunting film with a fabulous soundtrack that begs to be watched more than once.  All of the characters are connected in the end, but in such a subtle manner that one does not see the connections coming.  It is one of a handful of films that I was compelled to purchase, as well as the soundtrack. This film stays with you.",1131580800,,625,4.544642857142857
2359885,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is probably one of the most thought-provoking, well-written and beautifully acted films I have seen this year. In a collage of collisions, traffic and human, the disturbing underbelly of racism in LA is exposed in all its forms, each plot line producing outrageous events and even more surprising resolutions. With a cross-section of the public, multi-ethnic characters, cops, the advantaged and the disadvantaged, Crash manages to reach beneath the smooth exterior of everyday life, revealing the fractures that run through day to day relationships, the cherished prejudices, offensive remarks and outrageous attitudes that often go unchallenged, perpetuating more of the same misinformation. The acting is finely nuanced, Don Cheadle's disaffected police detective, Graham, Matt Dillon's jaded and racist cop agonizing over an ill father at the mercy of an uncaring health provider, a bickering black couple (Thandie Newton and Terence Howard), who are humiliated by police officers (Matt Dillon and Ryan Philippe), the husband's manhood put to the test and found wanting, an Iraqi shop-owner, confounded by his new country and a language he cannot navigate.

Brilliantly scripted and acted, this film is an example of the quality Hollywood should be providing instead of trite comedies and lackluster superheroes, as potent as Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"", exposing, transforming, confounding in every scene. With all the obvious disaffections of our society, absolutely nothing is predictable, the characters challenged at every turn, their precious beliefs transformed by changing events. Stereotypes abound, as do personal epiphanies, death defeated by a fickle choice, an astonishing exercise in the vagaries of fate and the promise of hope, no matter how spectral in the broader perspective. There are no facile answers and all issues aren't resolved, but the film is a wake up call to those deadened by the endless cacophony of daily defeats and the helpless rage that accompanies almost every endeavor. In moments of personal challenge and an almost overwhelming failure to achieve harmony on even the most elemental level, Crash reminds us of our humanity and ability to transcend our basest responses to crisis.

The acting is phenominal, as is the manner in which the writer and director were able to intertwine everyone's lives.

After reading some of the reviews written, I have to comment.  Some people feel that there were just too many coincidences to make this movie believable.  However, you've got to think about the premise of the movie.  These people didn't know each other at all.  Thousands of accidents happen everyday, and who knows how many of those people we've run into in the course of our everyday lives?  Forget about the fact that they are all famous actors and happen to see each other throughout the movie.  The fact of the matter is, the story is ALL about coincidence and how personal feelings toward one another kind of bring these things together.

One more thing...  I read about how a woman thought the movie was fantastic, and anyone with any kind of immigration experience will adore the story.  Maybe true, maybe not.  She then went on the say that she doesn't feel that a Caucasian would enjoy the movie as much.  This STAGGERS me...  She just watched a movie about racial prejudices and talks about how great it is to get the message out, and then makes a comment like that.  Listen, we've got to get to a point where we see each other as people, not Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Asians, etc.  That's what the movie is all about.

Sad to say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the movie mostly because it did not equally cover all of the ethnicities fairly in my opinion, most especially Asians.  I was exceedingly upset after watching the movie not for the plot but for how the filmmaker decided to showcase ""all"" (used very loosely) ethnicities (I WILL NOT USE THE TERM ""RACE"").  I do not want to go too much into why it was disappointing TO ME because some of the specific instances in the movie may give some of it away.  I will say that Asians/Pacific Islanders may be offended if they see under the surface of the movie and discover that Hollywood doesn't like Asians/Pacific Islanders, unless they are used in martial arts movies and, more specifically, if they are female (why are asian/islander women rarely ""coupled"" with asian/islander men in American movies, TV, commercials, etc?  America's fetish for Asian women, perhaps?)  Also, does the ""you all look alike"" joke ever get too old?  It's getting ridiculous...

 I gave it 2 stars because the rest of it was watchable and it did spark enough of a reaction out of me to be upset.  That and I did very much relate to Don Cheadle's character (great actor).  Although I will say that a lot of the instances where the characters interact are very unrealistic (you'll just have to watch it to see what I mean).

I've said enough....I'm getting upset again. But before I close, I will say that on a sociological standpoint, you have to watch films/movies like this one with a shrewd and sensitive eye and not take what it has to offer at face value.  If you think outside of the context of the movie then you MAY understand what I am trying but I'm not expecting it.

The movie, CRASH, raises many questions about the issue of race, such as how far have we come? How come we know so much, but so little about the people around us?  The film is quite controversial because of its depiction of stereotypes and misconceptions that people make about one's race, ethnicity, and class; The collage of stories interconnect with each other.

Director Paul Haggis and Don Cheadle produced a character study type of film about race.  The star-studded cast, which includes Sandra Bullock, Brandon Fraser, Matt Dillon, and a who's who list, do an exemplary job.  The opening scenes of CRASH ignites with an exchange of racist fervor and an automobile crash, and ends with an automobile crash with the exchange of racist fervor to suggest that racism is an unending circle that never seems to end.  The film tackles generalizations people make about another's race and class that imposes reverse racism on both sides with those making the racist comment.

The concluding scenes are the most pivotal.  While watching particular scenes, watch for how the St. Christopher statue is depicted in the film - how similar we are when successful communication is dispersed, but when there is a lack of understanding, things get ugly.  The most memorable and disturbing line in the film is when veteran police officer (Matt Dillon) speaks to his rookie partner (Ryan Phillipe) about identity.

'Crash' is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched.  The script doesn't miss a chance for picking on people because of exterior perceptions and stereotypes, and no one is exempt from the hate.  The plotline is pretty much a day in the lives of many people, and how they can intertwine with the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.

How many assumptions will you make, watching this film?  Where does your ""tolerance"" begin and end?  Rich or poor, no matter your color or religion, 'Crash' will spare no one the humiliation of being human.

Aside from a script that asks more questions than it answers, 'Crash' is an exceptionally well-cast film with stellar performances, superb editing, outstanding photography, and enough insults to go around for everyone no matter where or what circumstances you come from.

Sandra Bullock, who plays Jean Cabot, the DA's wife, has proven herself in both comedic and serious roles.  Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) is perfect as Det. Graham Waters.  His partner, Ria, (expertly played by Jennifer Esposito) is a strong female cop who clashes heads with Waters (among other things).  Brandon Fraser as DA Rick Cabot gives a great serious performance in spite of the fact I always see him as George Of The Jungle.

Thandie Newton gives her best performance to date in the role of Christine Thayer, movie producer Cameron Thayer's wife.  Terrence Howard is simply amazing in the role of Cameron.  Keith David (Requiem For A Dream) is excellent as always.  Watch for a great performance by Ken Garito (Summer Of Sam, Clockers), an actor I will keep my eye on from now on.  Ludacris and Larenz Tate are perfect as the roaming car-jackers.

The real surprise comes from Matt Dillon.  Perhaps he has never had a role challenge him before, but he absolutely shines in his role as Sgt. Jack Ryan.  Absolutely Dillon's best performance.

There are small cameo roles by Marina Sirtis as Shereen (yeah!) and Tony Danza as Fred (yuck!), but my hat goes off to the entire supporting cast of this amazing movie, along with director Paul Haggis.

I would rate 'Crash' higher than five stars if I could.  I think it's a movie everybody should watch, if only to judge your own reaction to it.  Being an aficionado of horror, I find judgmental behavior based on anything other than how you are treated by other people more horrifying than the bloodiest of films.  'Crash' will make you think.

We have different stereotypes of each other and instead of coming together to defeat this gap in society we are isolating each other creating a deeper gap.",1130976000,,622,4.822429906542056

It's amazing how a movie with such a great script and worthwhile cast didn't garner more than $55 million dollars in ticket sales. I guess since there was not a husband and wife trying to off each other,or a brick man in it $100 million was out of the question.
  Anyway,""Crash"" involves Matt Dillon,Terence Howard,Sandra Bullock and a host of other actors dealing with realistic racial stereotypes.

2359931,3,B000A3XY5A,"Many have complained that ""Crash"" is just too contrived in its plot and acting.  It is true that the movie has many convenient twists and turns, but these devices are meant to demonstrate a larger point.  The point is that we, as Americans, are all in this together.  We may be separated by race, culture, ethnicity and gender, but each of us has a role to play in society.  People may not see the interconnectedness, but we do have a common stake in the eventual outcome.  In the later half of the 20th century, as Americans moved out of the close confines of urban existence, and as huge faceless conglomerates developed that destroyed the traditional family business, Americans lost a personal touch that they once had.  As different cultures and ethnic groups cloistered themselves in their own communities, misunderstandings and fear increased from one community to another.  Misunderstandings and fear led to racism, but as `Crash' rightly points out, stereotypical thinking is not limited to one group.  All the characters in this movie have a chance for redemption.  Some redeem themselves by their actions, but some make it by simple twists of fate.  We all know to be bigoted and racist is wrong, but it is good for a movie like `Crash' to remind us that yes, we may have preconceived notions of people, we should not let those feelings blind ourselves that we all have a common stake in a positive outcome for all.",1130803200,2,1425,4.779591836734694

I like how Dillion's character succumbs to sexual temptation but at the same time, he is capable of having such a strong compassion and love for his father who is being failed by America's health care system, unable to fix his prostate problem.

I didn't even realize that it was some of the same people in more than one different story till I read some of the other reviews presented here.  I also don't think it's very realistic.

The Iraqui man goes out gunning after the Hispanic locksmith who he feels cheated him-knowingly with a BLANK PISTOL?

2359951,4,B000A3XY5A,"Exploring modern race relations in film isn't an easy thing to do. It's too easy to come across as preachy or trite, and very difficult to explore the subject as the complicated and messy thing that it is.

""Crash"" more or less succeeds in orchestrating a symphony of different characters in modern Los Angeles, all of different races, ages and social status, and showing what happens when they ""crash"" (hence the title) into one another in tumultuous and often violent circumstances. Some highlights of the film (and cast) include: Sandra Bullock playing against type as a rich, self-entitled woman who becomes the victim of a carjacking, Ludacris as a car thief who justifies his actions through armchair philosophy, Thandie Newton as an Ivy-league woman groped by a racist cop, and Ryan Phillipe as a self-righteous rookie cop who discovers that his moral superiority is just an illusion.

Although well acted and executed, what this film is lacking is a unique vision of its own. It plays like a cross between P.T. Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (where an ensemble cast experiences drama and tragedy while their lives intersect) and Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" (where characters of different races confront one another with brutal honesty that escalates into violence).

I actually was able to sit through ""Grand Canyon"" (though yes I cringed a lot too) but the reason I bolted from ""Crash"" halfway through was because of how totally predictable and implausible everything became---especially the part where the husband whose wife was mo lested by a racist cop goes nuts and overpowers 2 armed carjackers and almost gets himself shot by different cops, not knowing that just earlier in the same day the same racist cop has just saved his wife's life by sheer coincidence.

This movie might have some noble motives but is the most unwatchably preachy, predictable and hopelessly CONTRIVED movie I've seen in a long time. The dialogue is also hilariously GODAWFUL---everybody talks pretty much the same, totally out of character, like the working class Mexican locksmith explaining to his daughter the meaning of the word ""impenetrable."" Also irritating is a pretentious soundtrack that rips off bits of New Age and vaguely Eastern music.

What a waste of some very good actors! Hold your nose...

One day later: well, I forced myself to finish watching the whole movie and am happy to say that it was not 100% predictable as I thought, more like about 50%.  It takes more of a Zen-like, ""WTF do we really know about ourselves?"" ending.

I would give this 2 stars instead of 1...I still have a hard time with how artificial, self-conscious and tedious this film is, in spite of a very good cast.  If it were made by a bunch of high school students maybe I'd cut it more slack, but this is pretty cheesy stuff here.

2359954,5,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis' impressive creation ""Crash"" is an intersecting series of vignettes surrounding personal conflicts that have arisen among the films wide cast of characters.  These personal issues by and large are based on racial discord present in the diversified populace of metropolitan Los Angeles.

Haggis uses his many actors to create situations fraught with irony and pathos to make us aware of the racial profiling that we normally practice on a daily basis.  He uses his film to point out the danger created when we judge people based on preconceived notions regarding race, creed and persuasion.

The talented Don Cheadle who produced the film is effective as Detective Graham Waters who unwittingly winds up investigating the disappearnace and subsequent murder of his younger runaway brother.  Matt Dillon is also particularly efficient as racially bigoted Officer Ryan who despite his prejudices proves his mettle in a heroic rescue of a recipient of his undeserved scorn.

Haggis did a fine job in directing his players in a well conceived plot.  This flick was more of a showcase for writing and cinematic production.  While some of the bigger named Hollywood stars didn't have major roles, everybody pulled their weight in their portrayals to make ""Crash"" a successful endeavor.",1130284800,2,1290,5.258536585365854
2359955,4,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a gripping urban drama that gets under the skin of racial prejudice compellingly.  It displays intricate construction and intelligent, if melancholy, exploration of race and class warfare, telling interlocking stories of different races, classes, cops and criminals alike.

Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton head a superb group of ensemble actors, as several story threads intermingle over 2 days in a gritty visual of Los Angeles, an arena of prejudices spiraling out of control.

These stories are examined with precision and realistic tension, and all merge to highlight today's stifling tribulations of intolerance and ethnic suspicion, elevated by the ever-increasing stress of day-to-day living.

It's an intriguingly mixed cast, operating away from the racially harmonious zones we often observe.

In a outstanding cast, the standout may be Dillon as Officer Ryan, the personality with the most extreme variation of evil and good, brutality and benevolence. A cynic who bullies people of color, he's also a devoted son caring for a dying father-and we come to see that the bad side of Ryan is a sheath grown over the good.

But out of this chaos, ""Crash"" also suggests that acts of righteousness, mercy and compassion matter-that anyone, at any moment, can make a crucial difference. Haggis doesn't necessarily convince us, partly because his fiction is too patterned, a little too coincidental.  But ""Crash"" does convincingly argue that, in a world where everything can seem to be black and white, nothing really is.",1130284800,2,1591,5.34

2359958,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a very entertaining movie that combines multiple ""stories"" into one film. This motion picture examines racial and ethnic stereotypes and it is politically incorrect to the extreme. The characters depicted in this film have many prejudices that they hold dear and they have no problem openly expressing how they feel.

Several different stories are told in this film and they all focus on the controversies and problems of stereotyping certain individuals. There are people in this movie who hold prejudices against blacks, Hispanics, women, and other groups. They are put to the test several times where they have the opportunity to shake off some of these negative feelings about other people. Sometimes, they successfully remove the negative mindset. Other times, the feelings of prejudice are compounded further.

One of the many great things about this movie is its lack of predictability. I won't say too much here, because I don't want to give the film away. But there are many moments where the film seems like it is slowing down and getting a little repetitive with all the racial talk, then out of nowhere, something hits you like a ton of bricks. It happens more than once, and it adds greatly to the movie's appeal.

Another asset of this film is its all- star cast that includes (among others) Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, and Sandra Bullock. Everyone in this movie excels on the big screen and the director did a fine job with his timing and the emotions he elicits from this great cast of Hollywood actors and actresses. They all contribute top- notch performances to this film.

""Crash"" is a thinking person's film and among its many strong points, this is probably the one that matters most. After watching it, I ended up discussing the film's finer points with others who had watched it with me. We discussed the topic of racism and stereotyping; how easily this way of thinking can manifest itself in most any person; how it can adversely affect one's life; and how difficult it is to eliminate. Any film that can make you think the way this movie does is a film worth watching. And I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great, creative, thought- provoking cinema.",1130198400,3,2196,4.848
2359972,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is one of those movies that you need to watch closely, and take notice of details.  At first, I thought it was slow getting started, and I got kind of bored.  When the grocery store of the Persian family was trashed, I turned it off because I thought there was enough foreshadowing to conclude that either the locksmith or his daughter were about to be harmed.  I absolutely cannot stand to see children hurt in movies like this, or bad things happen to their parents...

The next day, I decided I wanted to see what happens, so I started watching where I left off and was very glad that I finished it.  There are too many story lines and connections between characters for me to get into describing them in great detail, but I think this is one of those movies where there's a little of each of us in at least one of the characters.  I just think this is a movie that everyone should see.  It shows how even people who think themselves to not be prejudice at all may still have a little bit of it them, it just takes one instance for it to be brought to the surface.  And it shows that sometimes when we suspect we should be cautious in a situation, our fears are very much valid and we should feel comfortable acting accordingly.

Stereotyping and prejudice are all around us.  Whether you're on the giving or the receiving end of it, it's there.  This movie shows you how wrong or how right people can be when they decide to judge others by their race/ethnic origin.  So, the question we are left with is ""Is it really wrong to stereotype or be prejudice?""  Your life or death may depend on how you view this issue.",1130198400,2,1624,4.32013201320132

2359977,3,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Higgis' directorial debut ""Crash"" is a fustrating, engaging, stagy and captivating movie that uses mostly one-note stage tricks to move the plot along instead of moving along cinematically.

The problem is that a movie even with a subject matter as bewithering as race relations must at first start with three-dimensional characters with real human being feelings and emotions and not machine-like actions. Every character in this film is a representation and symbol instead of being full complete indivuals.

The cast does a handsome job with the heavy material especailly Matt Dillion, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard who are all worthy of Oscar nominations. But their characters are trapped in film that fells to tell us anything about racism we didn't know and sometimes offends us with blatent cliches and contrivances to get across its not so original point.

Still, there is no denying that ""Crash"" is involving from begining to its stagy end. You can't help but be engaged by a film with this much amibition and a wonderful cast.

The story is about an interlinking section of lives between people of varying ethnicity, working backgrounds, and class and how one little event can effect the lives of those they've never met.

Racism rears its ugly head early and often in the film, and does so in the bright light of day. Nothing is hidden or candy-coated for the audience. And all of the characters have depth and emotion and love and hate and fear and hope balled up inside themselves.

A cop, who cares for his ailing and aging father in a very loving way, is also a bigot and uses his power as a policeman to exact revenge on those (i.e. African Americans) he sees as causing many of his and his father's problems.

A district attorney who gets his SUV car-jacked one night, tries not to stereotype those black men who stole it, but also has to deal with what ""the black vote"" will think when this news comes out. He also has to handle the sudden panicky fear his wife feels toward any minorities they meet (including their long-time, hispanic housekeeper).

A hispanic man who installs locks for a living must deal with the prejudices people feel toward him because of some gang tatoos that peek out from underneath his clothing. But he's also a loving father with a little girl at home who fears that something bad will happen to her; they used to live in a very tough neighborhood where gunshots were a common sound. The scenes with this father and daughter never ceased to grip me, especially when some of the girl's fears appear to be coming true.

A Persian immigrant who owns a store must fight to understand and to be understood in a land where he feels hatred at every corner because of the Sept. 11th attacks. And he responds in kind by buying a gun to protect his store's property, much to the dismay of his wife and daughter.

...And the list of characters go on, each event folding over and effecting the others. It's an awesome spectacle to behold, and the end is like a piece of interpretive art. There's no definitive message to hang on to other than that we're humans, flawed and greatness in equal quantities.

The all-star cast was also pretty impressive: Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frazier, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Daniel Dae Kim, etc.

I've read some other reviews here that comment on the ""sterotyping"" of the racist characters. But that is completely and utterly untrue. The fact that the characters often knew the stereotypes surrounding them, and commented on these, helped bring the screenplay to an entirely different level. And if, as a viewer, you felt offended by the film, you might want to ask yourself why that is.

Although the film uses race to deliver the message of hate, fear, and shallowness, the ending is surprisingly up-beat as some (but not all) of these great characters grow internally.",1129766400,2,2971,4.641904761904762

2359985,4,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a solid drama exploring the complexities of race relations in modern America, specifically Los Angeles.  The movie opens with the aftermath of a minor car crash, which serves as a metaphor for the lives of the Angelinos in this film; they're all seemingly disoriented.  A number of inter-locking stories subsequently unfold - some of them can stand on their own, others are told in fragments that add to the overall tapestry in clever ways.  As such, it can be compared favorably to such multi-character movies as ""Magnolia"" and ""Short Cuts.""

The best aspect of ""Crash"" is its multi-layered nature.  In the end, none of the characters come off as angels.  Those who initially seem open-minded and non-racist slowly show themselves as otherwise, sometimes in subtle ways.  That's what I appreciated most about ""Crash"" - the subtle moments.  The best example is the second meeting between Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton, which seems to end much sooner than one would expect.  A lesser movie would have milked this scene for sentimentality - a sin of which ""Crash"" is rarely guilty.

The cast is also uniformly good, particularly Thandie Newton, Michael Pena, and Matt Dillon.  The casting of some of the most likeable actors (e.g., Sandra Bullock) as some of the initially ""ugliest"" characters may seem like a cheap ploy, but it slowly pays dividends.  Director Paul Haggis does an admirable with ""Crash;"" he's best known as a television director - ""Crash"" is his first theatrical release since the obscure 1993 movie, ""Red Hot.""  If he can maintain this momentum, he could become a major film director.  The movie was made for approximately $6.5 million and grossed over $55 million, so he'll definitely get a shot.

The only major weakness is a too-obvious music score; the music swelling at tense moments really undermines the otherwise subtle nature of the film.  In addition, some viewers may find all the plot coincidences to be a bit much; however, these kinds of multi-character films often rely on the overlapping nature of the characters' lives, so I wasn't bothered by this aspect.  Overall, these flaws are minor compared to the quality of the film and its performances.  Although it's not a masterpiece, discerning viewers will probably like ""Crash"" a great deal.

CRASH is about racism of all kinds, not limited to just 'black and white', theres lots of cultural differences from all groups explored in this movie.  But most of the problems the various characters encounter come from the fact that they're mostly just jackasses.  They all act like idiots, and for the most part cause their own problems.  Racism appears to get blamed for a lot of the bad events, which to me, seemed to be caused more by a lack of common courtesy/respect.

There's a lot of good acting, but this movie is just basically a downer, and I don't know that it accurately represents a large portion of today's society.",1129334400,9,767,4.411347517730497

But ""Crash"" rises above the pitfalls of similar films, dealing with racial and cultural barriers beyond black and white, avoiding stereotypes while still admitting they exist.  The director deftly threads a number of stories together.  Although this may seem overwhelming at first, it quickly pulls together into an engrossing tale.  The acting is flat-out amazing.  Five or six actors deserve awards for their performances, but they may cancel each other out at Oscar time.  The screenplay is brilliant.  It will receive an Oscar nomination, I have no doubt.

I knew this would be a ""heavy"" film.  As I watched, I found my heart twisting into knots.  And yet, somehow, the director makes sure to give us moments to catch our breath without losing the story's pace.  Scenes that seemed to lead to inevitable consequences often surprised me, with redemptive moments for a number of the characters.  Not all works out for good, but the movie left me feeling uplifted and challenged at the same time.

Can we learn to appreciate others' differences?  Can we put ourselves in their shoes long enough to care?  ""Crash"" asks us to do these very things, and, if you can respond, you'll love this movie as much as I did.",1129161600,2,1328,4.800884955752212
2359988,3,B000A3XY5A,"This omnibus fable is as provocative as its daring concept - thirty-six successive hours of hostile, racially charged activity intertwining diverse characters in contemporary Los Angeles - and contains some powerful acting. But at the end of it all, I was left rather hollow by the experience. Steeped in allegory with scenes that start with a key assumption (either on the character's part or ours) and end with some unexpected redemption, the novelty of first-time director Paul Haggis' 2005 film is initially powerful but gets wearing over its running time.

Haggis ambitiously presents a multi-ethnic city full of unremorseful anger - where the inhabitants without exception eye each other with suspicion and ignorance to the point where the familiar epithets fly. Much of the early dialogue is uncomfortable to hear at first, but Haggis and co-screenwriter Bobby Moresco derive the shock value from the innate familiarity one has with the pent-up feelings expressed in such an unfettered and sometimes blackly humorous manner. The intense honesty of the dialogue is the film's chief virtue, as it is rare for Hollywood to acknowledge any race problem in its backyard. More often, filmmakers pontificate about it from an antiseptic soapbox (consider ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as a prime example).

A labyrinth plot has been constructed entirely out of the fabric of humanity torn mercilessly by racism, and the travails of over a dozen interconnecting characters make for quite a chess game. An ambitious young and white DA and his ice-cold wife are the victims of a carjacking at gunpoint that leads the wife into a state of hostile paranoia. She has the locks changed at their house by a Latino whom she myopically suspects is a gang member. In truth, the locksmith is a devoted family man who must face daily prejudices in his customer-oriented job. The carjackers are two young, seemingly educated black men who commit the crime out of an uncontrollable rage.

A black TV director faces the humiliation of seeing his wife groped by a racist white cop, while his young, nave partner watches with equal helplessness. A Persian store owner, constantly labeled an Arab, has his daughter help him buy a gun for protection. A black detective, saddled with his drug-addicted mother and criminal brother, is partnered professionally and personally with a Latina, as they to solve the mystery of a dead body in the road. They all collide in ways that are alternately compelling and manipulative.

Most of the acting is stellar, but accommodating the complex plot with an expansive cast does not allow much screen time on an individual basis. Cast against type are two actors more famous for their light comedy roles - Brendan Fraser and an especially unsympathetic Sandra Bullock as the DA and his wife. With this brief role, actually with one confrontation scene, Bullock may just have overcome the hurdle that constantly befalls Meg Ryan - her perky likeability has convincingly been subverted by a sharper, nastier edge of anger. I hope she does more such adventurous work in the future. Michael Pea plays the locksmith with dignity and provides one of the film's most primal moments when an angry customer blindly seeks restitution from him. Larenz Tate and a particularly impressive Ludacris play the carjackers with intelligence and fury.

Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton sharply delineate a marriage where they straddle precariously between their black identities and the white power base that keeps them living in style. Matt Dillon does some of his best work in the challenging role of the racist cop, while a surprisingly effective Ryan Phillippe embodies the moral ambiguity of Dillon's partner with lan. As the detective, Don Cheadle - who also served as producer - provides the authority to bring it all together. Even an out-of-character Tony Danza shows up in a cameo as a racist actor complaining that another actor is not sounding ""black"" enough.

But there is an evolving contrivance to the story, especially toward the end when plot threads are sewn up in an almost too circular fashion. For example, there is no denying the power of scenes such as the second encounter between Dillon's and Newton's characters or the revelation of the dead body's identity, but there is also a sense of parable that undercuts the credibility of the situations. The fates of key characters seem to follow a similarly moralizing pattern as previously deplorable bigots show their courage and compassion under emotional duress or dyed-in-the-wool liberals tap almost too easily into their inner misogynist. Everything just seems too neatly thought out to make the movie truly transcendent.

The DVD is surprisingly skimpy on extras - a throwaway introduction by Haggis, a by-the-numbers making-of featurette that focuses more on how the actors desperately wanted to be part of the film, a music video and several trailers that I fast-forwarded through. Haggis, Moresco and Cheadle  provide concise though informative commentary on an alternate audio track.",1128988800,4,5063,5.150851581508515

2359991,3,B000A3XY5A,"This film has, for the most part, excellent acting and well constructed scenes.  The pace of the storytelling is also excellent.  All in all, there is a lot to like about this film.  The key fault, however, is that this film goes way over the top in trying to make a statement on racism.  According to this film, everyone in LA makes every decision of every day with race being a major consideration.  No one in this film escapes unscathed.  Is LA really that bad?  I'm from Texas and I've never seen racism like that.  I find this level of racism completely unrealistic.  Only race hucksters would have you believe that people still make that many race-based decisions.

Also, the film makers appear to be terrified of making any moral judgements.  Every one of these race focused individuals is ultimately shown in a favorable light.  For example, the bigot saves a black woman; the drug dealer frees slaves and gives them cash; the cop who sends an innocent man to prison for life just to help his brother is seen in a compassionate light as he agonizes over his treatment from his mother.  Still, the film survives these weaknesses.

Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Brendan Fraser give the top performances, but most of the other actors are nearly as good.  The stories are fascinating to watch and the movie really kept my attention.  Although there are several off-scene car accidents, once car chase, and a shooting, this is by no means an action film.  It is definitely for those who like an interesting chain of events while being able to swallow the fact that these people keep bumping, er crashing, into each other accidentally in a city the size of LA.

It is a very honest and well made movie, the script is great, the characters are powerful and it is filled with unexpected turns. This movie keeps you guessing throughout, makes you uncomfortable at times(you might just find yourself identifying with these characters and their stories in ways you didn't expect) and really leaves you thinking at the end. It is easy to write this off as just another movie about race and stereotypes but you're doing yourself and this movie a disservice if you do. It's really not about black vs. white or good vs. bad, this movie hits on the good and bad parts that exist in all of us whether we admit them or not, or whether we're even aware of them. If you actually let yourself watch the movie and don't immediately get turned off by all the stereotypes that come at you from the very opening scene, you'll find that crash tells a very powerful and important story.

Pretentious, predictable, unwatchable.  The all-star cast could have been scrapped and replaced with racial stereotypes written in gigantic, flashing neon letters that drifted lazily across the screen.

There are a heap of elements that I truly appreciated about this movie, including its obvious honesty, its depth of character, its twists and turns, its play on luck, karma and faith, and its ability to allow the audience to sympathize with both sides of most of its internal clashes, as well as its surface aspects like the direction, the score, the acting and the story.

There isn't a character that doesn't think down on another person.  Crash beats in the point that no one race is superior, or inferior.  This movie needs much more publicity though.

There is no plot, just a series of intensely unlikeable people doing reprehensible things to each other. There are no characters, merely mouthpieces for the writer to espouse what he apparently thinks are varying viewpoints on the way people interact. Unfortunately all he does is perpetuate stereotypes. You see, the film's failure comes from its subject matter. It's about race. Period. Virtually every character in the film is racist. And the director would have you believe that every encounter between people is about race. It's ridiculous. The interactions between them are meaningless because nobody talks like the people in this film talk. It's impossible to take the film seriously because the director is so heavy-handed and the subject matter so pretentious that it drifts into self parody.",1128556800,23,1063,5.186046511627907
2360024,3,B000A3XY5A,"Dealing with race in a film is a difficult task because emotions inevitably become intense.  Crash deserves credit for being able to weave in stories about race with some talent.  However, the problem with the film is that Haggis simply using ""Hollywood stereotypes"" as a starting point and then, implements a strategy with his characters playing with them like there are puppets or a deck of cards without letting his characters develop realistically. Those who are not afraid to admit their naivety and ignorance will probably find the film more powerful than those who have truly learnt the ridiculousness of 'generalizations'.  My guess is this film will appeal to suburbanites with very superficial urban experiences or racial ones, who have been bred on way too much television.  Those with 'real' urban or varied experiences will see that the film as lacking depth and maybe serving as a very mild introduction into the complexity of race issues.  While Terrence Howard is powerful in this film, unfortunately, too many tricks by the director and the ""Magnolia"" allusion make the film come off a little phony / Made-for-TV.

Wouldn't it be remarkable if the words we cherish most as both prescient and haunting at the end of the last century came from Rodney King, ""can't we all just get along?""

That's the key to the Lion's Gate release of the Paul Haggis film, ""Crash."" Because the racism from white to black, black to white, white to hispanic, hispanic to Persian, hispanic to asian, asian to white all seem so foolish and unrealistic, until we stop and recall how we thought that, saw that, felt that or said that, just 12 hours ago.

The interlocking path of intersecting stories somehow operate seamlessly with a number of surprises and while the plots don't have a ""feel good"" result, perhaps one does get a hopeful result.

I saw this on the heels of ""Run Lola Run"" and no, I'm not going to connect the German Punk film with the American indictment of our ability to profile everybody in a literate poem to xenophobia. Except . . .

There is a hint that if we were just a little kinder to eachother once in awhile . . .

I feel the biggest success that Paul Haggis accomplished was how he used the race issues throughout this movie.  The main point of the story was to show that even the most racist person still has compassion for his fellow man(Ex: when Matt Dillon risked his life to save the same lady he sexually harrased the day before).  And also how the most liberal guy can still stereotype (when Ryan Phillippe shot the black guy cause he thought he was pulling out a gun.

Anyone who does not automatically exclaim, ""EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!!""  is automatically branded a racist, when in fact this film inadvertently celebrates robot racism (""white-people-bad-black-people-bad"").  It's all so exhausting.

I further dump on the movie and most of its reviewers for not giving a big ol' credit to films that were obviously deeply influential:  Grand Canyon and Falling Down, to name two.  With more subtlety, I see a failed attempt to co-opt the art and rhythm of P.T. Anderson in this reel.

The objective, in this sort of a movie, is to send a message to the audience and if ""contrived"" works, and the message gets sent (and received), then so be it. The message is that racisim is present at many levels and constantly in everyday life, regardless of the economic class of the individuals involved.

  This movie will make you question your own firmly held biases and prejudices, and will leave you re-evaluating your own view of the world.  In our day-to-day lives we may not see the violence and concentrated social collisions that are exhibited in CRASH.  But intuitively, we know what these extreme examples illustrate; the real examples of how our stereotyping of individuals may cloud reality.
  We become so overwhelmingly devoted to what our eyes and ears tell us about someone - their skin color, their accent, the kind of car they drive - that we fail to see through the surface to who that person may actually be.  Or, as this movie so aptly points out, maybe we had it right the first time; maybe the stereotypes we hold are there because they actually do represent reality.
  This is the point of the movie; the conflict between what we think we know about people versus the fact that sometimes our first impressions completely miss the mark.

Although they viewpoints people have in this movie may not be correct, they are still justified at least in their minds.  We have Rick (Fraser) & his wife Jean (Bullock) who are robbed by two black men, Anthony (played by Ludacris in a role I'm floored he pulled off) & Peter (played by Larenz Tate who once again proves he has talent beyond recognition).  This only intesifies the fear and unhappiness that Jean is already experiencing in her life.  Sandra Bullock plays this role flawlessly and I'm only upset to the fact that her role is shortend and more lead time would have been wanted.  You see, Anthony and Peter work for some ""red-neck"" as he puts it.  They steal cars and he sells them.  Anyways, Anthony has a view I've seen alot, the view that everyone is out to get the black man.  He sees everything as a finger pointing at him and he sees everyone, white or even black females, as wanting to put him down.  Peter seems to have a more balanced view.  Theres one scenerio.  Next is Farhad (Shaun Toub) who is a Pershian store owner who is buying a gun with his daughter for protection from the neighborhood.  There are words thrown between Farhad and the store owner and eventually Farhad is thrown out and his daughter makes the purchase.  You can see the way these people are treated all because of an incident (9-11) not involving themselves but a people they are linked to.  You have Cameron (Howard) and his wife Christine (Newton in her best role yet) who are harrased by Officer Ryan (Dillon in an amazing turn as a racist cop).  You can see the hatred in his eyes and when he explains his fathers condition your almost in tears.  This movie shows how each of these situations is interwtined and how these people are affected by they're suroundings, and hopfully how they will be changed by their experiances.  The most gripping plotline to me revolves around a locksmith (Michael Pena) and his family and how they are involved in a heartwrenching sequence involving Farhad.  Graham (Don Cheadle) & Ria (Esposito) are parters (homicide) and lovers and are involved in a case involving a white officer who shot and killed a black officer, both cops undercover and it appears the black cop may have been on coke and crooked.  The question comes into play, do you prosicute a white cop whos killed three other black officers (all claimed in self defence) or do you let him off because he may be telling the truth?  What would you do, especially if you were a black man who may or may not feel that white people as a whole take advantage and or put down the balck man.  Ryan Phillepe (it's nice to see him in a film) plays Officer Hanson, Dillons partner who is outraged by his partners blatand racism, but is faced with a battle of conscence when alone with Peter (Tate) in one of the most hearwrenching scenes in movie history.  I don't want to give too much away involving the outcomes of these charactors, just know that when the television goes black you will have a lot to think about, that being whether your white or black, asian, hispanic or Arab...our nation, our country as a whole places these steriotypes over each other, and as this movie shows sometimes we put them on ourselves instead of just being who we are and accepting each other for who they are.  These movies should be made more often.",1127952000,4,3482,4.536
2360048,5,B000A3XY5A,"When I saw this movie in theatres, I was truly blown away by the heavy subject matter that the film deals with. It tells the story of how everyone's lives intertwine and that we all have certain biases, whether we choose to acknowledge them or not.

2360049,5,B000A3XY5A,"This 2004 film is powerful.  Set in Los Angeles, with a large cast of excellent actors, the theme is racism the crash of human beings against each other.  These crashes are constant and often have surprising results.  And yet, they are all too familiar.  This film brings light to this very unpleasant subject, and it does this in a way that is immediate, forceful and easy to understand.

There's Sandra Bullock, an upscale white woman, who fears blacks and Mexicans and makes assumptions.  There's Don Cheadle, a black detective whose younger brother seems to be on the road to crime.  There's a wealthy Chinese couple engaged in an illegal trade.  There's an Iranian man who is mistaken for an Arab and who commits a disparate act.  There's Matt Dillon as a racist police officer who humiliates a black couple but who is having trouble with the HMO bureaucracy that is keeping his father from getting proper medical treatment.  There's his younger rookie cop partner who tries to do good but yet lets his own prejudices cloud his judgment with dire results.  These are just a few examples.  There are many more.  In fact, the whole film is a series of culture clashes where everyone has assumptions and anything can happen.

The film moves fast and completely pulled me in.  The characters feel real and multi-dimensional.  The screenplay is excellent and often touches a nerve just below the surface that we all can recognize.  It's also courageous, putting into words some angry and unpleasant thoughts.  Once in a while I found it a little preachy for my taste but mostly I just was drawn into the story.  I cared about the characters and couldn't wait to see how it would all play out.

2360051,5,B000A3XY5A,"I'll not go into the plot details because they are already chronicled in the Editorial Reviews.

Good movies are hard to come by nowadays. Contrived plots, mediocre acting, stale writing and poor directing seems to be the norm.

Yet, Crash suffers none of these artistic or technical ills.

I was a bit leery of seeing so many big names together. Many times these ensemble casts equal a very ""Hollywood-y"" movie.

Not so for Crash.

Brendan Fraser and Matt Dillon, two actors I'm not very big on, were supberb in this film. Don Cheadle, while not giving a performance on par with Hotel Rwanda, was convincing. Sandra Bullock, another actress I'm not a a big fan of, was excellent as the uptight, angry socialite who is, esentially, friendless. Thandie Newton was utterly convincing as was the actor her played her husband.

The actor that really stood out to me, however, was Michael Pena. Pena played Armando ""Army"" Renta in FX's The Shield--sidekick to officer Shane Vendrell. In Crash, Pena plays a locksmith. The storyline about this hardworking locksmith--which includes moving his wife and daughter to a safer neighborhood, encountering racism from a Persian store owner, and endowing his daughter with a magic, invisible ""impenetrable fairy cape"" was utterly gut wrenching.

Of course, most of the stories in this movie evoked strong emotions in me. I even recognized *gasp* some racist attitudes that I, myself, unknowingly harbored. I was horrified at how we treat our fellow humans. Yet, most of us do the best we can--and no individual is 100% good or 100% bad. We're a mixture.

And Crash brilliantly portrays the mixture that we are. Matt Dillon's chracter (a member of LAPD) goes from groping a black woman during a pull over, to attempting to save her life in a car crash, to standing over his cantankerous father while he's sitting on the pot--in major pain over some undiagnosed prostrate ailment (that the HMO won't grant coverage for in terms of seeing a specialist to help him).

Crash is about racism, about choices, and about consquences. Superbly acted, it is gut wrenching, heart-warming, inflammatory, and nakedly honest--all at the same time.

(PS: Look for Marina Sirtis, who played Betazoid empath Deanna Trois in Star Trek:TNG, as the Persian shopkeeper's wife.)",1127779200,4,2291,5.021108179419525
2360062,2,B000A3XY5A,"Total overkill. How often do we need to be beaten over the head with scene after scene of racism? How contrived is it that the characters in every scene somehow are related to the characters in the next scene, previous scene and in the end, everyone is affected by everyones actions. Yeah, I understand that that is the point of the movie but the coincidences were a little convienient. This thing plays like a made for tv movie. Also, Sandra Bullock is so absolutely awful in this movie. Just like every other movie she is in.",1127779200,4,527,4.5
2360063,4,B000A3XY5A,"I'm somewhat on the fence about this one.  I can't decide if it depicts racial biases fairly or if it's trying to perpetuate racial stereotypes.  Some of the situations are such a stretch that they're not very believable.  On the other hand, some of the situations and dialog are so subtle and heartbreaking; it left me really wondering what is wrong with the world today.

That said, I think this is one of the most well put together and thought provoking movies I have seen in sometime.  I was riveted.  Immediately in the beginning of the movie, I related to the Sandra Bullock character.  Not because I'm a pampered upper-middle class housewife, but because I have often wondered why it is that we live in a world where we are not allowed to be frightened or uncomfortable in some situations.  We do, after all have an instinct to protect ourselves, and that instinct knows no race.

Some of the scenes were wildly predictable, such as one with Matt Dillon on the road to some kind of redemption.  But even these scenes, this one in particular, was extremely intense and moving.  The best scenes in this movie, although predictable, were the ones that included a blue collar Hispanic locksmith and Persian immigrant.  Their failure to effectively communicate with each other hit the core, I think, of many of the problems this country does face today.

It left me disturbed.  I think it was supposed to.  I kind of look at this movie like a parable.  It may not be realistic (is The Tortoise and the Hare?) but it does provoke thought and at least tries to teach a possible lesson, such as unreasonable, snap judgments may lead to tragedy.  Good guys may appear to bad, and bad guys may appear to be good.  And we may not always know about the guys in between.  The always fantastic and always under-used Loretta Devine had me wondering on this point. So did Don Cheadle's character, which he played brilliantly.  And pay attention to his mother in this movie. Although very subtle, she had her own heartbreaking, distorted judgments. I think no matter what, it's a fact of human nature that we all have our biases, in one form or another.

It may not be for everyone, but the acting and filming was outstanding.  A haunting, excellent score also accompanies it.  If you like heavy-duty drama, give it a shot.  You will have an opinion.",1127779200,4,2340,4.637469586374696
2360064,4,B000A3XY5A,"Set in the middle of over-populated and fabulously diverse Los Angeles, ""Crash"" tells the story of 96 hours in the lives of 20 or so people.  In some way, all of their stories intertwine and each is taught a valuable lesson, some end happily, while others are left in misery.

The film starts with Detective Waters(Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria(Jennifer Esposito) sitting in the back of their car after it had just been hit by a frantic chinese woman.  While in the car, Det. Waters tells Ria ""It's all about the touch.  In big cities, people walk by and brush shoulders or bump into you.  IN L.A., nobody touches anybody else.  And, sometime we all need to crash into each other.""  This is basically what all of the characters in this film are going to do in one way or the other.

Told in brief scenes and with many characters involved, ""Crash"" takes us through the lives of people from all different ages, races, classes and backgrounds and depicts how each of them view those that are different from themselves.  We have Richard(Brendan Frasor), who is L.A.'s district attorney and his wife Jean(Sandra Bullock).  Jean is shaken up at the beggining of the film, when her and Richard are car-jacked by Anthony(Ludacris) and Peter(Lorenzo Tate).  Not only is Jean shaken, but she is angry and distrustful and quickly lets her feelings be known. She demands the locks on the house be changed again in the morning, because she insists the Mexican installer will bring his ""homies"" back with the spare keys and rob their house.  HE will also play a large role in this film and is my favorite character.  His compassion is something that the rest of our characters, for the most part, lack.

There is a Persian family, who run a small convenient store in the city, that is repeatedly rob.  This prompts the father to purchase a gun; which he finds to be terribly difficult, due to his nationality.

We have Officer Ryan(Matt Dillon) who is having issues with his father's health conditiona nd is bitter with minorities over affimative action laws.  Unfortunalty, he takes his anger out during a routine traffic stop on Cameron(Terrance Howard) and his wife.  His partnet, Officer Hanson(Ryan Phillippe) is less than pleased with Ryan's actions and asks to be transferred, something he finds is a difficult process.

This is the just the start of the film and is only really what happens in the first half-hour.  The remaining 90 minutes is a collage of fast-paced scenes in which all of the above-mentioned characters and some others, are confronted with racism and how they react to it.  Almost all of our characters will question their prior beliefs and some will actually surprise themselves.

This film is really terrific.  The cast is superb and the direction is very well done.  I knocked a star off, simply because, with all of the characters involved, there are just too many happy endings.  Not all are happy, but, too many are.  It's not that I don't like happy endings, it is just that in a film that felt so real, some of the endings didn't.  But, justice IS a real witch in this film!

Matt Dillon gives what I consider to be his best career performance in this film, and Ludacris is overly convincing and effective in his role(I had no idea he could act).  Hey, we even get a 2 minute cameo of Tony Danza, playing a TV show producer.

All in all, ""Crash"" is a film that should be watched and will probably not disappoint!  Very violent, so put the kids to bed first.

What I loved about the film was the direction. They do not come any better than this. Matt Dillon, you earn more respect than ever. This is easily your best performance. The soundtrack to this movie adds to the absolute haunting drama that ensures an everlasting impact. This movie is about a lot of stories thrown in together. It's about America and how a variety of people live there. People with their own merits and demerits of characters. This movie is not flawless but it's definitely everything a 5 star movie should be.

Watch this movie if you wish to  believe  in half of anything you just read.

The title is metaphorical for the secret need we all have of impacting each other, and how the only way we get out of our own private bubble is through pure coincidence or fate. Those are the devices through which the characters here interact over a typical night and day in Los Angeles. As a study of a cross-section of L.A. is succeeds brilliantly. My only problem with the film is this: IT'S TOO SHORT! Why this film wasn't longer is beyond me. The characters are so interesting you could spend whole movies with each of them. In any case, ""Crash"" is a great achievement. If you haven't already, see it.

One person you think is a racist really isn't.  One person you think is  good usually isn't.  One person's actions causes another person's misery.  Everything a person does intertwines with each other.  Paul Haggis writes and directs what I think is the best film of 2005.  Whether the film recieves any nominations is anyone's guess.  Sandra Bullock should deffinitely recieve a Supporting Actress Oscar Nomination as this is her best acting work to date.  Haggis should get a knod for his challenging screenplay, the best I've seen since Robert Altman's ""Nashville"".

The characters although from every walk of life, become dramaticly intertwined in each others destinies over these two days.  First of all, let me acknowledge some critics of this movie in that the plot is thin at best and that some of this encounters are highly implausible. However this is not the point of the story.  Also, while racism is the prevalent theme of the movie, it is more the lense through which the other themes of justice, family, politics, survial, and others are viewed through.  Also, some have said that the movie is guilty of pushing emotional buttons, but those buttons need to be pushed.  I believe the point of this movie is to make one feel and thereby think.  There are some very powerful and disturbing moments in the film and you should take that in consideration before viewing it. Especially moving is the intersection of two Father-Daughter relationships, one Mexican-American, and one Persian, and how both daugthers ""save"" their fathers in the same scene.  Two of the biggest sub stories deal with two policemen-- one unsavory fellow, played beautifully by Matt Dillon, who despite his bigotry, anger and bitterness ultimately finds redemption within himself.  Ryan Phillipe plays his partner, who in the biggest shocker of the movie, falls from grace to become everything he fears and hates.

Despite being a bit forced or over the top in some places, it is quite entertaining and definitely a emotional rollercoaster.  I would hope that you enjoy it.",1127606400,6,1565,4.893939393939394

Sadly, this film didn't even do that - a single moment's worth of Sharon Stone crossing her legs was far more effective.

It doesn't work either as a metaphor for our ""love affair"" with the automobile. One could perhaps build a sonnet around such an image, but ""Crash"" is a one-trick pony that gains nothing from endless swinging of the same sledgehammer to crack the same nut.

A lot of them focused on just one aspect of the plot... The obvious casts prejudices and racism's... I mean yes the director and plot made this an obvious point, but they also made a less obvious one as well throughout the length of the movie... If you fixate or concentrate on the most obvious here you will not find the hidden little jewel here placed so beautifully... Just as in life if you become too narrowminded and not be open enough to see what's in front of you, you tend to miss out on the best things in life.... Unfortunately I can not really dive into the whole plot and all here for you without giving too much of the movie away, I can say this is for sure one of the best movies I have seen yet in many years.... If you like a movie with a plot that will leave you thinking in the end, and saying hmm or wow, then this is a movie for you... Or if you like a movie with meaningful plots, something that will keep you in your seat or chair or sofa at home, and anticipating the rest of the movie or for more, then again this is the movie for you... I think this movie has a lesson in it for all of us to learn... All I can say is god works in mysterious ways, sometimes even out of bad comes good... And if you really watch and listen yes listen to this movie, I'm more then sure most of you will understand exactly what I mean by that... And hopefully you all will see the lesson in this movie that I have come to learn myself after watching it.... It's truly a must see, watch it twice if you have too, but I'm sure with this review you won't have too, you should point it out for yourself as well, I pretty much have spelled it out for you... If you don't buy the DVD at the very least rent it on one of them boring sundays with nothing to do, and looking for something to pass the time with... Good movie to watch with a friend or loved one, and at the end talk about it together, see if yall both come up with the same thing in the end, also great for movie or DVD clubs and or buffs...

It's easier to hide our heads in the sand than to watch this movie. The main theme deals with people's prejudices and racism which isn't the simplest of subjects. It's easier to just pass this film by than to challenge ourselves to confront our prejudices.

The main characters in the film end up with intertwined lives in the course of a day. People they may not have met in the normal routine of things, but people they'll need when chaos ensues.

What I had a problem with was the director's desire to ""intersect"" all of the main characters. This gimmick has been used to death in the last 10 years or so, and it really weakens the overall effect of this film. It's ultimately too 'gimmicky' and destroys the level of power it sometimes attain. I also had a problem with Ludacris being cast in the film just for his real life image as a 'thug rapper."" In real life, he's not much of a thug, just a poser, and in the film, he's simply a very bad actor.

This film is basically a hit or miss affair, but, many people will too quickly hail it as great, because certain scenes are very effective and provokes deep reactions. If they happen to view it twice, they will certainly notice it's many flaws and weaknesses, and regret their high praise.

It's not a bad film, and it's one that actually deals with racism from many angles with truth, but, it's ultimately a little too gimmicky and tidy to be called an outstanding film.

For example, Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who pulls over an African-American couple and sexually assaults the wife while ""patting her down"".  Then later in the film, after we've been subjected to his attempts to explain his racism to another African American woman, he arrives on the scene of an accident and lo and behold has to save the woman he molested.  OK, could we be any more dramatic?  Or predictable?

And other scenes like it.  The young idealistic cop who shoots a young African American man (he picked up a hitch hiker why?); the Persian who tries to take out his frustrations on the Hispanic locksmith who fixed his lock the night before (was I the only one who knew the daughter bought him blanks?!?); the Asian man who is dealing in Thai slavery; the African-American thieves who swear they will never ever steal from ""one of their own"" ending up in a situation where they, lo and behold, steal from one of their own.

I think this was a good idea for a film.  I think, overall it was very well excecuted, and well-acted.  The short narrative style of the film worked for me.  But it was too over-the-top, too predicable, and too determined to prove, that in their own way, everyone is a racist.

The best character for me?  Jean (Sandra Bullock, in a thankfully less glamourous and less comedic role than I'm used to seeing her in).  Why?  because she represents what many of us think.  After being carjacked with her husband, she goes into full rant mode.  At one point, she goes on about how if you're racist, and you genuinely feel that way, you can't express it because you are then inherently a bad person, whether or not you are/are not correct, and look where that got her... carjacked.  Whether she is right or wrong isn't the issue, though.  It's all about political correctness.

We have become so politically correct that we cannot face our own inner feelings because, as this movie tries to show, we all have our prejudices, and they always lead to something bad.  With the exception of the all-accepting locksmith who moved from the barrios to make a better life for his daughter, no one gets out of this film unscathed (and his unscather was just really dumb and demeaning!).

I agree with several reviewers that the only thing missing was a militant gay man, but I also agree with Lost Highways (yes a special mention).  The movie claims to be about race, but when I look back, the characters I associated with the most, and felt the most for, were the women.  Maybe this movie did accomplish what it wanted, but with gender and class as opposed to just race.",1127088000,3,2720,4.549382716049383
2360101,5,B000A3XY5A,"Race relations have perhaps never been dramatized as well as they are in Crash.  Never!  It's a movie that you might want to watch again as soon as you've finished it, simply because it's so rich and deep that you won't want to miss anything.  That's a kind way of saying that it's a complicated story that should be watched attentively.

The movie deals with a 36 hour period of time in Los Angeles.  During that time you'll encounter racist cops, car jackers, cynical politicians, road rage drivers, slave traders, paranoid shop owners, unfeeling bureaucrats and a more racially diverse cast than any five other movies you might see.  Characters come and go, crossing paths, interacting with each other in various combinations; with many of them slipping from victim to villain to hero depending upon which situation they're in.

In the ensemble cast, Don Cheadle stands out with a performance that is even better than the one he gave in Hotel Rwanda.  Thandie Newton is also impressive (as she usually is).  Other actors with less distinguished bodies of work (like Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza and Sandra Bulloch) should rank this film at the tops of their accomplishment.

Other actors deserve mention as well, Ludacris, Larenz Tate, Bahar Soomekh, Tony Danza, Loretta Devine and Michael Pena all excel in minor roles that remain memorable in far greater portion to the time that they are given on the screen.  Clearly they all took their roles seriously.

Earlier this year, when Oprah Winfrey encountered some apparent bias in Paris, she described it as her ""Crash moment"", that point when someone is judged solely by the color of their skin, their origin, their dress or other minor detail.  It's an apt metaphor as Crash will have you mentally reviewing your first impression of virtually every character in the film at one time or another.  It's a mobius strip of prejudice as blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, Persians and other ethnic groups foist their own biases and agendas on each other.  Crash is a tour de force!",1127088000,2,2040,4.906705539358601
2360112,5,B000A3XY5A,"I have often been deeply moved by a particular movie.  But Crash hit me on a gut level and did more than just move me.  It actually changed - or rather deepened - the way I relate to the world around me.  I can no longer encounter someone who is giving me a hard time or being an obstacle or even doing a ""snow job"" without wondering what's behind their action.  I may still be irritated, hurt, or even enraged by them, but after seening Crash stop and try to consider the source in a whole new way - and more and more I don't react as harshly as I once would have.

The opening scenes are very hard to watch as you encounter each charater from the outside - seeing only the surface - and almost no one seems likable.  But you are steadily drawn into their lives behind their ""game faces.""  And you begin to see that each one is just trying to make his or her life make sense.

I couldn't help but see some aspect of myself reflected in each revelation - scene after scene; how I have jumped to conclusions or over-reacted or too easily failed to see someone else's humanity, and how my own reactions just contributed to a deteriorating situation.  I came out of the movie almost shaking, and haven't been able to forget it since.  And I find myself constantly using it as an example when I hear someone relating some horror visited upon them by some jerk or even someone close to them.  Mostly my advice is ""You need to see Crash.""

Crash is also an amazing display of ensemble acting and cinematic story-telling.  There are no stars as such and no primary story line - perhaps the story arc itself is the leading player because the bits and pieces add up to so much more than the individual stories.  Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton are given the most riveting scene, but it was Ryan Phillippe's story, as the young idealistic cop who was dismayed by the violence and just trying to do no harm or at least bring some sanity into an insane world, that put the exclamation mark on the film for me.  We all are drawn into unpleasant situations from time to time and we all have our limits - no matter how noble we try to be.  I really do believe that most people are just trying to make their lives make sense - especially when denied what we want.  But we all need to stop and consider the ""other"" before we react and too often regret.  And Crash drives that message home almost relentlessly - in ways that words can't really convey.

I hope this movie wins lots of awards, but mostly I hope lots of people see in it and take it in.",1127088000,4,2531,4.2573221757322175

2360114,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is one of those films that you hear about with thunderous hype, knowing that it is controversial; at the eye of its' storm is race. This multi-character film deals with racism in the western world, using the USA as its' background. Various characters such as the disillusioned black cop Graham (Don Cheadle), the anxious and assuming Jean (Sandra Bullock) and the multi-faced director Cameron (Terrence Howard) are a few of the diverse personalities that make up this rich and intense race relations study.

There are many reasons why this film works (all of the actors' memorable performances) and listing them would be futile because once you see it, you will know! However, I think that the main point about this film that elevates it beyond a run of the mill race film hoping to get viewers is the fact that it breaks away from stereotypes as the characters are laced with hypocrisy, immense personal struggle and loss. It doesn't make scapegoats out of certain characters nor does it let you emphasise with one character over another. It lets you look into their lives and more importantly, it raises important questions over the race debate in today's modern world -- for example, the tough and unrelenting script gives us a stark look into the life of one of the memorable characters Farhad (Shaun Toub) who suffers due to the intense political climate of today, thus showing that ""Crash"" is more than just a film about the struggles between blacks and whites in the States.

Go see this film -- it is a 3-dimensional film on the emotional level and undoubtedly thought provoking.",1127088000,2,1595,4.860294117647059

If you are not moved by this film in one way or another, you need to question your place in humanity. This movie grabbed me tightly and did not let go until the credits rolled. To tell you the truth, with all of the crap being released in the theaters today, this one has absolute value. You will walk away changed for the better. Wonderful, wonderful film. Don't rent it, buy it!
Oh, and for those of you who thought Sandra Bullock could not possibly make for a convincing racist....Wrong!

I'm not sure if America will ever NOT have a race relations problem but at least this movie tells it like it is - like it or not, those of you that ""hated"" the movie. Hard to face the truth sometimes but it has to be done - we all have stereotypes and this movie ""picks on"" everyone equally, rich, stuck-up white people, black people, Hispanics, Asians. The best part was the Hispanic father and his little daughter, just beautiful the love between those two.",1126915200,,583,4.7254901960784315
2360117,5,B000A3XY5A,"I loved this movie.  It's like an updated modern version of Grand Canyon (Danny Glover etc).  Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play husband and wife (good teaming) and get car jacked by a pair of young black guys (Ludacris is one of them), a black couple get pulled over by a white cop (played by Matt Dillon) who's a racist, etc etc etc.  It's a movie where there are a lot of bit stories that merge into the whole movie, depicting the class lines in Los Angeles.  It's a great cast with so many recognisable faces.  The movie plays along in about a 36 hour time period following all of these stories.  It's an eye opener that's well acted and moving.  Initially I was apprehensive when I went and saw this, but I'm so glad I did.  Again, it's moving and admittedly it's a bit hard to watch but important to see.  Go get this, you'll love it.",1126915200,,844,4.291139240506329
2360118,1,B000A3XY5A,"Let me begin by saying I was really looking forward to this movie.  In retrospect, it was so poor, I'm inclined to write a review.  Firstly, the sad notion of every single moment of everyone's life being influenced by racism purely promotes the problem.  Racism is real, don't get me wrong.  But it is also a business; and keeps many pundits, film makers, and entertainers rolling in money.  Secondly, the constant perpetuation of stereotypes in this film made we wonder when the dirigible full of Nazis was going to hover over the city and start firing at Jews.  Some of the ludicrous comments made (no pun intended) such as ""buses have big windows to embarass the poor folk that have to ride them"" are so dismissible.  In my city, most all the folk that ride buses are commuting to downtown to avoid traffic.  Most are white, and guess what, they don't have more petite windows accordingly.  Last I saw, commuters on subways seem to be themselves completely on display.

Next you have the non-racist policeman (Phillippe) who just all of a sudden turns racist the next day after asking to be separated from his racist partner (Dillon).  If he had suddenly turned racist, he would never had picked up the black hitch hiker in the first place.  There isn't one character that doesn't turn in this movie.  All the bad become good and vice versa; ala professional wrestling.  Take into account the man who was being carjacked and when pulled over by the police, decided he had some kinship with the man he was just beating up a moment before (still in the man's car and yet he didn't alert the police of that fact).

To summarize, this movie portrays life as a series of awful events that happen to every person all caused by races other than their own.  What a truly sad world that would be; and yet the only ones richer from the experience are the persons involved in making this propogandist film.  Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have done any better.",1126915200,14,1947,4.629737609329446
2360119,5,B000A3XY5A,"Today, many movies and television shows exist in order to offend, such as South Park and Family Guy.  They insult religion, ethnicities, and even the different genders.  Shock value is used to either teach a lesson or just plain have fun with the audience who would never think that anyone would say such things.  Crash is different.  The almost non-stop racial remarks in this movie aren't in good fun; they are meant to be taken seriously, as if real people would (and probably do) say/do the things that the characters in this movie do.  Crash shows us just how deeply ingrained racism is in our world even if we choose not to acknowledge it, and it does so without mercy.

Crash takes place over the course of about 36 hours.  The movie begins toward the end, as we meet Det. Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) at a crime scene.  Graham makes a few remarks about racism and life in LA, then we are taken back to the previous day, and a diverse group of characters are introduced to us.  Farhad (Shaun Toub) is a Persian convenience store owner who relies on his daughter to translate most of his conversations into English.  Due to his poor grasp on the language, many things that people tell him get lost in translation.  Anthony (Ludacris) is a young black man who constantly complains about how black people are treated in LA by both white and black people.  His friend/partner Peter (Larenz Tate) tries to argue with him, but Anthony usually wins.  After a profound speech about how they are misunderstood, the pair carjacks an SUV from the Los Angeles District Attorney and his wife.  Rick (Brendan Fraser), the DA is a nice enough guy, but when it comes to politics, he tends to display a little ""reverse racism"".  He is way too concerned about how black people will respond to the carjacking.  His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), on the other hand, is a high-strung racist who doesn't hold back when she thinks she has someone figured out.  Two other police officers soon enter the mix while searching for the DA's car.  Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) is a blatant racist and abuses the badge whenever he is in a low-risk situation.  However, when life is at stake, he tends to be a pretty good cop.  His partner, Hanson (Ryan Phillipe), detests him for his racist behavior.  Hanson is a rookie who (I hate to say this) is still naive and idealist.  The duo pull over Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), a very affluent black couple, and Ryan has his way with the subdued Cameron.  Finally, there's Daniel (Michael Pena), a Hispanic locksmith who, on the same night, has an unfortunate encounter with both Farhad and Karen.

The cast of characters is very large, which in turn causes many interesting overlaps.  Different characters move in and out of the lives of each other, causing many misunderstandings, fights, and embarassments.  With few exceptions, every character at some time or another, shows that racism has nearly permeated our entire culture.  The characters that are openly racist can sometimes do good things for the people they claim to hate, while other characters who try to be moral can sometimes be subconsciously racist.  I can think of only one major character who never showed a racist side, however, due to the beliefs of someone else, was put in a bad situation.

One of the best things about this movie is that it is so hard to watch.  Some of the things that people say are just so terrible that one doesn't want to ever think about them.  But I guess that this story had to be told sometime, and the writers and actors do a wonderful job with pure hatred.  The characters act and react the way their real-life counterparts would, while none of the characters are actual stereotypes.  The actors do a great job with this film, even Ludacris, who is a rapper, not an actor.  One reason for the great performances may be that the actors had a lot of passion for this project (Bullock even paid for her plane ticket out of her own pocket just so that she could be in this movie).

This movie is not for the weak of heart, and not everyone may be ready/prepared to hear what it has to say.  Nonetheless, this is a film that I wholeheartedly reccomend.  Everyone should, at some point, see this movie.  The message is very powerful and very important.",1126915200,2,4336,4.641732283464567

It deals with race and what happens when different races collide... how do they interact? It also clears up how often in times our assumptions about people are way off. But it is human nature to judge and have these pre-conceived notions about people... sometimes we are correct in our assumptions and often we are not.
It's hard to really discuss this movie without giving too much away... so I'll just leave it up to you to see for yourself.",1126915200,3,702,4.246268656716418

2360132,4,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is a collection of scenes from 2 days in the lives of a group of Los Angelinos who are directly or indirectly connected to one another by chance. The action of the scenes revolve around racial attitudes and racial politics in the multi-ethnic city. ""Crash"" essentially explores two themes: One is the effect that strangers have on one another. The other is the consequences of racial conceptions and racial politics. The film doesn't seem to be about ""racism"" per se. Some characters may be ""racist""; others stereotype according to experience; some act out of anger, others out of ambition. It is more about the consequences of preoccupation with race, regardless of whether racial preconceptions are accurate or not. The characters bluntly speak their minds about people of other races and ethnicities, as well as their own. The dialogue sometimes seems too impolitic to be plausible, but ""Crash"" intends to reflect what people think and say in private, not in public.

The characters involved in this ensemble drama are: District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), whose car is stolen by 2 young black men. The men are Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Police detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are investigating a case of a white police officer shooting a black officer, while both were off duty. An affluent black couple, Cameron and Christine (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) are harassed by an apparently bigoted cop, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillan), and his unwitting partner Tommy (Ryan Phillippe). An Iranian shopkeeper (Shaun Toub) and his Americanized daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) disagree about keeping a gun after the family store is repeatedly vandalized. Their locksmith (Michael Pena) has no end of accusations tossed his way because he's Hispanic.

Once you get past the nearly 3-minute opening credit sequence, ""Crash"" moves at a reasonable pace. The early scenes of the Cabots, the carjackers, and the Iranian family made me wonder if this was going to be a film about a bunch of highly strung people arguing about nothing, but as the film progresses, we begin to understand the characters, and they become more complex than was first obvious. ""Crash"" is not preachy, not ""liberal"", nor ""conservative"". The scenarios are nothing that anyone living in a multi-ethnic urban environment wouldn't be familiar with. The film is to some degree sympathetic to everyone, in that it is willing to take each character's point of view for a while, but it is also critical of everyone. ""Crash"" doesn't offer solutions to American's racial issues, but it presents them frankly. It is not so nave as to deny the truths of stereotypes, or to deny their perils. Good deeds don't always turn out well; bad behavior doesn't always turn out badly. Sometimes people are too quick to judge others, while some aren't quick enough. Writer/director Paul Haggis embraces both the comedy and the tragedy in this complicated heterogeneous tableau. If ""Crash"" condemns anything, I think it is racial politics, which consistently foster unethical behavior and produce bad results all around. But whatever conclusion you draw, ""Crash"" is a kind of abstract of the American melting pot's more volatile ingredients.

The DVD (Lions Gate 2005): Bonus features include an introduction to the film, a look behind the scenes, a music video, some trailers, and an audio commentary. The ""DVD Introduction by writer/producer/director Paul Haggis"" (15 seconds) is very brief. Skip it. ""Behind the Scenes"" (10 minutes) includes interviews with the director, writer Bobby Moresco, producer Cathy Shulman, and members of the cast, in which they talk about the film's intentions. The ""Music Video"" (4 minutes) is for the song ""If I..."" by Kansascali. The audio commentary with director Paul Haggis, writer Bobby Moresco, and actor Don Cheadle is free form and has some lulls. Some subjects addressed are: the inspiration for the story in Haggis' real life carjacking, the cast, some details about filming on a relatively low budget in 36 days, the soundtrack, and the story. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",1126828800,,4226,5.184480234260615

I finally ended up seeing this movie to find out what all the fuss was about. Is it a good movie or a fluke? Well, it ends out being an excellent, powerful and intense movie definitely in my top 5 of all time after Frailty, American History X and Ghost World. As most of you probably already know, this movie is about Los Angeles and a group of people there that will collide with one another. There's a large variety of them including the rich and powerful, poor, cops, and foreigners. At the start of the movie, there was only one that I liked, and in the end, I liked more. But then there were the some that you had no feelings about and others that you dissliked. This movie is so powerful because I connected with the characters. I had different feelings towards each one and that made me have mixed reactions to all that happens to them. I would burst out crying at one moment and have no feelings if something of the same nature would happen to another character. The movie does give ope though, offering change anf showing that the characters here can change and may have reasons for the way they acted.

There's the businessman (Brendan Fraiser) and his hotshot, cocky wife (Sandra Bullock). There's the two criminals who like to steal cars. There's the cop (Matt Dillon) that seems to be evil and horrible but in the end, he was one of the few good people. There's his partner (Ryan Philippe) who is too good to be with a partner like Matt Dillon's character. There's the locksmith (Michael Pena) that is feared by people because he's  ""gonna sell copies of keys to his homies"". But he is in reality a kind loving and caring family man, that I was always connected to. I feared for him and felt like he was my friend. He is the best person in the movie and the way he is treated by Sandra Bullock shows the world's racism. There's the Iraqui salesman who fears for his shop and has loving and caring daughter. He also is a character that I pitied and liked. And in the end, he was another one I really liked. There's the detective (Don cheadle) who prefers sleeping with women than listening to his mother. For once, you don't really like him!

And then, there's the married couple, one almost white, the other balck facing troubles. They were characters that I seriously never liked or connected with and that were other examples of the cocky rich.

Buy this gem please, tell your friends the fuss is for real! Watch it as it's by far the best movie of the year and one of the best ever. It's a very dad movie showing our world the way it really is. So, watch it, and treasure it because for once, there's a good, original movie that deserves an oscar for best picture and one movie for once worthy of its praise unlike TRASH like American Beauty.",1126828800,,2772,4.40625

Fact is... when humans are deeply divided and blinded by their own situation, one way to touch their heart is with fable.  (All great spiritual teachers know this.)  This movie is NOT just about race nor is it realistic (one actually never sees the same person twice on the streets of L.A.).

This movie is in harmony with the old Buddhist proverb that it is ""impossible to say who will be enlightened at the end of the day by looking at them in the morning"".

There are a bunch of stories all seperated in this movie but Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) who plays the Detective ties all the stories together when he finds a dead body on the road and we learn at the end of the movie that it was Cheadle's brother that he found. Cheadle has his own issues to deal with like his brother, mother and he also is sleeping with his white partner, played by Jennifer Esposito (Spin City) The stories go like this, Brendan Fraser (School Ties) in a good role...its good to see him in another role besides The Mummy role and Sandra Bullock (Speed) who throws Miss Congeniality out the window here, get jacked up in their car by two thugs, played by Larenz Tate (A Man Apart) and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (Hustle & Flow).

2360139,2,B000A3XY5A,"I watched this film and tried to like it for many reasons. It tackled issues and characters in a raw and combatative manner and it was well made on many technical levels. However unlike Paul Haggis's other piece ,""Million Dollar Baby"", the script just did not hit the mark.

Virtually every set piece, I have seen in many other films of this genre;the cops frisking the woman,the political machinations involving Don Cheadles character,the whole carjacker/stolen car garage set up etc. The characters were all one dimensional, and besides the totally unbelievable about- turn offered by the Ludicras character , very obvious.

This film sets out to make us believe it is going to explore new territory within the realm of racial politics but the film is one tired cliche after another all strung together by the most contrived plot in years. Matt Dillon rescues the same woman he has sexually harassed ,Ryan Phillipe picks up and kills one of the carjackers .I realise that maybe the director spun a circle to bring these characters back together but for what purpose ? Redemption ? Irony ? I don't know. A well made failure.",1126569600,6,1125,4.854166666666667

2360152,4,B000A3XY5A,"I rented CRASH today. I had to. The movie doesn't surprise me one bit. It's really a movie for someone that doesn't live in L.A. or is simply stating the obvious. It's not an ""enlightening"" movie that will change your life forever.  Don't expect it to.

Yes, Los Angeles, with its multi-eclectic, multi-ethnic society is bound to have confrontations and animosity. We are after all, a ""stew-pot"" of different cultures and beliefs.  This movie hit on target every experience or desire that I've been confronted with in Los Angeles.  Even the police that have vowed to ""protect"" us can sometimes do more damage than good.  They can damage us physically, psychologically, and mentally.

We all have stereotypes and prejudices about each other. If you think this isn't true, have you been to the Museum of Tolerance? Try getting past the door that says ""Pass if You're Not Prejudiced."" You'll notice that you can't get through, no one can. We're all a little racist or prejudiced inside, no matter how open-minded and liberal we are.

The movie deals with prejudices with Blacks vs. LAPD, Muslims vs. Terrorism, Rich vs. Poor, and White vs. Black.  Whether you've experienced violence, prejudice, or racism this movie can clearly show you what it is to live in L.A. or modern America if you've never seen it before or it can open your eyes to what's always been in front of you.

It's a great movie.  Some stories were more developed than others and others I felt needed to tell me a little bit more.  We have Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe in a story where Dillon is a bigot and a racist.  He hates blacks because of past experiences with them and his actions are shown in the movie. The part was owned and dominated by Loretta Devine; she was great working with Dillon. Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock are the rich people dealing with their own prejudices and the political media.  Bullock realizes that money doesn't buy friendship and sometimes you have to set your differences aside to let people in. By the way, it's refreshing to see Bullock so high-strung and pissed she's great as a bitchy-wife, she's always so sugarcoated, unlike in this movie. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton deal with a negative experience and have to overcome obstacles.  Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito were also great, their characters were well developed and really lead us into the who dun nit mode which, starts off the movie.

In reality, there's violence all around us. Even the people that would surprise us are violent even though they may not show it. At any given moment anyone could crack and anything can happen. With the decisions we make every day we could affect the next person and as a result of that action the next person could act as an effect to our first action. We need to make sure to think twice about what we do and not be so quick to judge.  We should really give people the benefit of the doubt.",1126569600,,2908,4.672549019607843
2360153,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"", written and directed by Paul Haggis, writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"", is the first best movie of the year.

It is a labyrinthine melodrama taking an uncomfortably close look at racism and prejudice in modern America. The huge ensemble cast is flawless; everybody simply nails their part.

There are the expected stunners, like Don Cheadle, and the ones that blow you away, like the brittle harpy Sandra Bullock. First scene with her, and you realize you're not in Kansas anymore. I could list all the great actors here, some of them doing their career bests, but you can get that from the box cover...trust me, each and every one is a gem. Freakin' Ludacris? Who knew?

There are about eight or nine plot threads, which are tightly woven throughout the two hour running time (108 minutes plus a lot of credits...). A few contrived plot twists are necessary to bring certain circles to a close, but the story telling is very very good. It's not that you don't notice, you just don't care.

The direction is elegant, the cinematography crisp.

So technically, you should understand this is a fine film. What elevates it into that rarified air of greatness is the manner in which it handles an unquestionably volatile subject. If you know anything about people, much of what you will hear here is frighteningly accurate. You may think you do not have an ounce of racism or prejudice within you, but when seeing and hearing all the different ways it is manifest in our daily lives (as shown here), I think the average person will change the way they look at race relations after seeing this one film.

So much of racism is about blame. This movie goes deeper. And it goes across every major ethnic group, neither glorifying nor condemning each one. It shows good people misinformed or poorly educated, and it shows bad people who manage to find hope and understanding.

It's not clean, it's not tidy. It's ugly and intense. Many of the scenes have a visceral jolt I haven't felt in quite a while. The characters are so sharply drawn that the melodramatic incidents carry quite a bit of power.

This is one of those movies you will tell every one you know about; you'll tell them they have to see it...",1126569600,2,2206,4.667525773195877

2360155,5,B000A3XY5A,"Every action has an equal and opposiite reaction.

This film exemplifies that logic in the context of a thought provoking, raw, honest,  touching, portayal of people coexisting and connecting, without knowing it,  through daily urban life.

Every day,  people walk through their lives affecting one another without even realizing the influence that momentary connection has caused. One's thoughts, beliefs, prejudices, actions even a glance, nod, or smile....all have a domino effect on the lives of others.

You don't consciously think about it, it just happens.

Crash is an amazing film that addresses the issue of race and relationships in a raw, uncensored way. The film isn't shy. It speaks volumes in an ""in your face"" sort of way with characters who break the ""politically correct"" mold saying  outloud  everything that everybody thinks about one another but are afraid to say.

It depicts the varying degrees of love and respect people can have for each other wile they completely shun others who are not like them.

That is, until their fates collide.....in seconds..... resulting in characters undergoing a turning point, without realizing it,  from within.

The film literally left me speechless. It was beautiful, harsh  and thought provoking. Mark Isham's musical score resonates through the picture with an understated sentiment and haunting beauty.

The actors play their part with a welcomed reserved humility. Despite the ""big names"" gracing this picture, it is clear that they played their parts with heart,  remaining humble and true to their characters, not their ego.

Unlike other films, there are no mega star egos here. Just an uncontrived story and good acting.

Notwithstanding the unbelievable ensemble cast and excellent acting, the film is like an epiphany happening on screen. It speaks true and does not come across contrived or false.

The film deserves a rain of accolades, praise  and acclaim.",1126483200,,1928,5.279605263157895

But it's ""beat you over the head"" racial stereotypes, forced emotion (w/over-rated score), and obvious and unrealistic dialogue make this movie a bit cheesy, moreso considering how serious the filmmakers are treating it.

2360159,1,B000A3XY5A,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting something moving and exceptional from Crash. Instead, what I got was a cliched statement of the obvious, conveyed through some of the most forced, unnatural dialogue ever uttered in a movie. Right from the start Crash treats you like an idiot, when in the first minute of the film Don Cheadle explains the title: ""All this metal and glass... nobody ever touches in this city... maybe that's why we crash into each other."" The rest of the movie consists of an endless parade of stereotype characters (rich white b1tch, poor black thug) speaking in monologues that were probably taken from essays about racism written by junior high school students. I mean, the conversations held by Ludacris and some other dude are so ridiculous and phony, it feels like you're watching a bad sitcom.

Regardless of the terrible script, worst of all, Crash is just another Hollywood movie that winds up saying nothing by trying to say everything. Here's a summary of what Crash has to say: Racism is bad, we should all be nicer to each other and not judge each other, but yeah um, some stereotypes are based on truth, but you know, not all of them, and like, people are good, but some aren't, and some cops are nice but some are bad, but there's reasons for everything and everyone is sad.

2360172,5,B000A3XY5A,"I was talking with my wife a few weeks ago about how I felt that the quality and impact of movies was diminishing over time. I pointed to movies that had received Academy Award nominations in the last several years to indicate that this standard no longer reflects what it used to. Many nominated movies are indeed very good, but an Academy Award nomination it seems ought to go to movies that are truly exceptional and highly impactful.

Crash is an exceptional movie. You will certainly be unable to watch it without discussing it excitedly and thoroughly afterwards. There are excellent reviews written here to tell you what this movie is about. I will not do that here. I however choose to highlight brilliant writing, superb acting and wonderful directing (reminiscent of the work done by Paul Thomas Anderson in Magnolia). The vignettes are rich, deep and beautifully woven together.

Crash is highly impactful. You may find youself questioning ""what is racism""? You will be forced to see how extreme prejudice can coexist with abundant compassion and courage. It can be uncomfortable to reflect upon. Not unlike the uncomfortable combination of extreme violence and belly shaking comedy that are produced in some moments during Quetin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Furthermore, Crash may make you think about the importance of moderation. Must you always say what you feel and think? What is the right balance so that you do not go through life choosing never to express yourself? For the one character that did exercise moderation in Crash, look at the irony in terms of what was forced into his life that was certainly not of his choosing. So is moderation enough?

I echo the sentiments of one reviewer when she says that she hopes that this film will inspire film makers to produce work of this caliber. This is high art! Not everyone has the ability to produce something like this. However, I hope that the Academy of Motion Pictures recognizes Crash by nominating it  for the best picture award. It might inspire the few that have this level of talent to produce extraordinary work and it will recognize the film Crash and Director Paul Haggis for brilliance.",1126396800,3,2168,4.899182561307902

I'd be hard pressed to name the race of any co-worker, neighbor, or friend I know but, ""Crash"", for all it's kid glove liberal morale, lives in another world. A world of familiar racial stereotypes characterized as only pawns in high drama that more resembles network television, (picture a millionth episode of 'Hill Street Blues'), than it does powerful cinema. Black people are either hip-hop, jive talking carjackers or slaves to the system, white people are capitalistic, powerful and affluent, undisclosed low income Asians are robbery prone small grocery store owners, and Thai are helpless and abandoned slaves or refugees. The film succeeds in only it's whiplash sensation of melodrama; someone survives a sure hit with a gun, a character is pinned in a fiery crash, a man steeped with revenge leaves his home armed with a weapon.

2360176,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash will probably go down in history as not the film that won Best Picture 2005 but the worst Best Picture winner ever, in close competition with Around the World in 80 Days. For many, it's a socially important film and deserved its accolades, especially since it had a kind of indie-film feel with small budgets and a more performance-geared approach rather than big effects. In the end it's probably a film that shouldn't have won(I would've gone with Munich) but it's not a bad film nonetheless, it's just several flawed at times upset by some memorable scenes.

In probably one of the most credibility stretching 24 hours I've ever seen, a whole host of people are somehow interwoven in L.A and they all have one thing in common: they all have to deal with racism in one form or another. You get 2 policemen, a TV director and his wife, 2 philosophy wannabe black guys, a D.A and his wife, 2 cops/lovers and many others that are somehow connected to other. Guy 1 hangs out with guy 2 who has to deal with woman 1 who's married to guy 1. By the end of it, you think everyone is going to get into a reunion.

I would like the film's view on racism if it didn't shoot itself in the foot half the time. One scene, a black guy is ranting about a girl who flinched at seeing them walking towards them, however she was just cold, but he thinks she saw gangmembers. Well this would have weight if they didn't just carjack the couple 5 minutes later. Or the mexican locksmith who has to deal with a stubborn store owner only to not have insurance covered when the store's broken into. The film is saying ""see? racism is the problem there"" but I know better: it was a moronic store owner who didn't see the forest for the trees.

It does have some memorable scenes though. The scene with a police officer saving a woman's life in a soon-to-be fireball car is cool as well as the ""cloak"" scene involving a fired gun and a young girl, but it's mainly for Michael Pena's performance, and not for the kind of contrived feel of it. They're a bit too similar as they're basically music-only with dialogue cut completely out but they're effective scenes anyways. And it's great to see Jennifer Esposito in her um, slightly full glory, although Don Cheadle may not be your ideal bed partner.

Speaking of which, the cast is excellent but the performances are slightly marginal at best. They seem to exist to get the anti-racism messages across and they become merely vehicles to show off society's dark side. They're not really characters or people, except some of the cast works. But with such a big cast you're expecting a bit more than characters firing off every racist comment and slur you can think of. In fact, Ludacris' character seems like a spokesperson for anti-racism. I kept getting reminded the entire time of Mr Mackey from South Park and his ""drugs are bad, mmkay?"" speech. Racism is bad yes but here it just seems like surface skimming, not getting in-depth with it, just mentioning it is enough.

As for the ""director's cut"", I haven't seen the film for awhile so the film looks just the same as I remember it. Director Paul Haggis says the added stuff is just snippets here and there, not full blown scenes. I couldn't tell where they were though. The other extras are nice although it seems slightly skimpy, more substantial than its rival Brokeback Mountain though.

If you can get past the sledgehammer feeling messages about how everyone's a racist, you'll find a fascinating but flawed film.",1126396800,,3503,4.570063694267516
2360177,2,B000A3XY5A,"I heard a lot of great buzz about Crash before it was released in the theaters. Here, we were told, was a smart film about racial and ethnic prejudice where the writer/director turns every stereotype on its head and refuses to cater to our expectations. Sounded like my type of film. So finally I bought the DVD and have to say, sadly, that the ambitious theme of a diverse urban group of characters, loosely connected and only slightly developed, showing their small-minded prejudices, biases, and ignorance, looks more like an essay than it does a film. A couple of thug car-jackers lament racism while they brutalize human beings. A white rich woman condescends to her Latina maid and doesn't trust the Latino locksmith. An African-American cop talks racist trash to his Latina girlfriend, making her a stereotype. A white gun salesman accuses a Persian family of being terrorists. A black husband argues with his black wife whom he accuses comes from a family of too much privilege to understand his pain. A white cop hates an HMO supervisor, a black lady, whom he accuses of reaching her position through affirmative action. And on and on. This is really not a film but an essay about tribalism, the reflex to allow fear to rule our intellect. But as a film, the drama consists of watching people hurt each other over and over, relentlessly, usually pointlessly. Worse, the heavy-handed soundtrack, full of tearful laments and wails, tells us to be sad, as if we weren't intelligent enough to know that people hurting and killing each other because of their ignorance and frustration is indeed sad. So in the absence of a real film, here's what you get: Lots of made-for-TV melodrama, descending into bathos. Raw hatred. People screaming at each other. Bombastic, quasi-religious music telling you what sad emotions you should be coddling. Lots of guns. Chase scenes. People spewing racist venom. Sentimentality. Here's what you don't get: A believable plot. Nuanced characters.

Needless to say, I was gravely disappointed. If you want to watch a better urban film that cuts back and forth between many diverse characters, watch Robert Altman's masterpiece Short Cuts. For a much better film about urban racism, watch Falling Down starring Michael Douglas.",1126396800,6,2262,5.01595744680851

Rather than change my views on race, this only confirmed to me that multi-culturalism does not work and that we either are going to have to move toward mono-culturalism or we will quietly move into geographical/economic isolation from each other. This movie showed that it is nothing but a fantasy that hundreds of cultures can co-exist without misunderstandings and suspicions boiling up into violence.

2360179,4,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a bold, brave, and moving experience about people of different backgrounds-white, black, Latin, Asian, and middle eastern-and the ripple effects of their encounters with each other. Million Dollar Baby writer Paul Haggis steps up to direct this buffet of fear, hatred, anger, revelations, and stereotypes, and, surprisingly, he never ends up doing what his title suggests.

Haggis could have easily made this a sermon, preaching to us how we should all look past the skin and see what's within-typical mumbo jumbo we have all seen and heard before. But what he does is riskier. He sets up his characters-who they are, what they're going through, what ""type"" they fall under-and allows their stories to tell themselves, interconnecting much smoothly than could be anticipated.

There's the rich white couple (Brendan Frasier and Sandra Bullock) in which the wife, after being carjacked by some thieves (Ludacris and Lorenz Tate), becomes increasingly paranoid about anyone without her shade of color and their motives. The thieves are actually young black men, dressed as UCLA students, who have conversations about white and black relations that are quite insightful, such as when the Ludacris character explains why he would never ride a bus, or why he despises rap music.

There's also a detective (Don Cheadle) who is sleeping with his Latina partner (Jennifer Esposito). She gets upset when he calls her Mexican. He asks her how her people all learned how to park on other peoples' lawns. There is also a stubborn Persian store owner who is mistaken for being an Arab, a Latino locksmith who is just trying to raise his daughter, a racist cop and his rookie partner, a black TV director and his light-skinned wife who may be considered as ""acting white,"" an Asian man who is involved in ""transportation,"" and other minor characters that add depth to the film.

Haggis puts his heart in this film, and tries to wrench the viewer's. Some aspects of the film feel typical, certain situations feel forced, some emotions manipulated. We all know the characters will have revelations, a character or two will die, and people will be changed for the better. Or maybe not. But what's so interesting about the film is how those elements unfold before us, and they are easy to take thanks most in part to the terrific ensemble.

Everybody hits the right note, but the real standouts here are Matt Dillon as the racist, and Terrance Howard as the TV director. At first glance, Dillon is your typical white racist L.A. cop, but as his story evolves we learn of his reasons for his anger, due mostly in part to his sick father. Howard just shines as a man who must live with his decision to stand back as the cop molests his wife during an unnecessary pull over. That choice of his haunts him throughout the rest of the movie.
Haggis has done here what many filmmakers are afraid to do-expose the reality of a multicultural society, and the domino effects of individuals' choices concerning race. The film is brutally honest, even to the point of biting humor that will have you laugh out loud, and then think about what you just heard.

Crash isn't exactly a masterpiece, but it is a powerful, smart, and, most of all, bold deliverance of all our thoughts and fears of people of different races, and how in our day and age we should step back and take a look at ourselves before we judge others. You won't leave the theatre a completely changed person, but maybe you'll think twice about another race's perspective on situations. Just don't think too much-wouldn't want you to crash when leaving the parking lot.",1126396800,,3613,4.8381877022653725
2360180,5,B000A3XY5A,"This movie takes on so many plots that its brilliance is in how it manages to weave them into something believable, something where the plausible outnumbers the implausible, where belief does not (always) have to be suspended, and with only a few minor arguments one could make the case that many of these charcters lives intertwining in these most uncomfortable of ways was indeed possible and their actions resulting in a chain reaction of related events is taken at face value and beleived for once.

Haggis makes this a no-holds barred look at race and finds that all of us, regardless of ethnic persuasion, have it in our hearts to harbor a tinge of racism towards someone of another background and color, some in subtle ways, others in ways that are downright ugly and uncomfortable to watch. All of these are explored, and the circuitous route of this movie, starting a day ahead and then rewinding 24 hours and connecting the beginning with the end over the next 2 hours, to include the clever use of the film title in both instances, this movie is sure to grab your attention and not lose it.

Some of the references are obvious, and the director likes these characters to not only be victimized by the racial stereotyping constantly taking place but work to reinforce them, and they can be shown in other ways, like the turning of past injustices completely around (the scene where Ludacris, the hostile and acutely race conscious angry black male, pulling out the chains from the back of the stolen van, after he discovers it is full of Chinese boat people smuggled into the U.S. and held as hostages for sale, Ludacris sets them free, pulling the chains out as he drops them off in Chinatown, they all dirty and huddled in back. In this instance Haggis reminds us that there is still compassion even in those who appear to have none, or perhaps it is because of his race awareness that he makes this decision.)

Some criticize the movie for making a statement on racism and its associated guilt but that is probably not at all the message here, more like a transparent look at how these stereotypes manifest themselves over a 24 hour period in very different peoples lives, some even of the same race but vastly different backgrounds.

Unpredictable and clever, it also has a good, understated  soundtrack that blends perfectly with the plot twists, and enhances the movie even more.

The part of the rookie officer riding with Matt Dillon and the black producer of the television drama starring Tony Danza both gave superb performances.",1126310400,,2549,4.7687074829931975

2360202,1,B000A3XY5A,"Writer/director Paul Haggis would have us believe that everything in Los Angeles revolves around race. He would have us think that black car thieves are philosophers and have a code of honor. He would make us believe white racist cops would be allowed to openly exist in the LAPD. What Paul Haggis does in CRASH is ram his own white liberal guilt down our throats and tells us to like it. He tries to compose a giant irony-fest in which everyone's lives are seemingly interconnected, and what goes around comes around.

His irony isn't even subtle, but overt and predictable. He seems to have seen all three hours of MAGNOLIA too many times and tried to come up with his own version. He trades the rain of frogs at the end of MAGNOLIA for a snow storm in L.A. He plays on the same themes of death, failure and everyone needing to help one another despite biases. He purposely wants us to feel guilty that we have ever shared the same thoughts as the characters. I don't buy it, Mr. Haggis.

There are obvious stretches in credulity which make the film difficult to watch:

1. The Los Angeles County District Attorney has a driver. He would not have been carjacked.

2. No police officer I know would EVER pick up a hitchhiker, late at night, I don't care what color he/she is. This part of the movie is shameless manipulation.

3. It is wrong for Haggis to infer that Matt Dillon's character could get away with behavior that is clearly against LAPD policy. These matters are thoroughly investigated and for the most part the officer is considered guilty until proven innocent. Many officers have been suspended for less than what Dillon's character does while an investigation is pending.

4. I do not believe for a second that Ludacris would not have shot Terrence Howard when the carjacking went awry. There is no honor among thieves. Bottom line is to get the vehicle, and anyone who gets in the way is eliminated. People have been killed for less than a vehicle. Portraying a car thief as not really a violent person is wrong.

5. When Sandra Bullock whined to her Hispanic maid, ""You're the best friend I have,"" I threw up in my mouth a little. Puh-leeze!.

6. No cop would say something so pretentiously pseudo-existentialist like, ""I think we crash into each other just to feel something."" DUMB!!!

I know, I know...""It's only a movie."" The problem is, Paul Haggis wants us to think this is reality. Reality is worse. CRASH, to be truly realistic, would have had to have been so offensive to all people, the studio would never have released it. Instead, we have the watered down version of real life. You can keep your guilt trip, thank you.",1126310400,22,2649,4.607218683651805
2360203,4,B000A3XY5A,"Director/writer Paul Haggis follows up ""Million Dollar Baby"" with ""Crash"", a gritty film on racial stereotypes. The film takes place in Los Angeles, a hotbed for racial tension over the years from the Rodney King beating and to a recent violent showdown that led to one unarmed man dying. The story revolves around a handful of characters who do are complete strangers to each other but they in some odd way have a connection to each other. The events that occurs in the film is in a 24 hour setting.

The film begins with rapper Ludacris as Anthony and Larenz Tate as They carjack Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Rick's (Brandon Frasier)Navigator so they can sell the car to a chop shop for cash. Frankly the film should have found other actors to play Jean and Rick. I have yet to see a convincing performance from Sandra Bullock and Brandon Frasier in this lifetime.

Matt Dillion plays veteran cop officer Ryan who just happens to be a racist cop. Ryan Phillipe plays his partner officer Hanson who doesn't stand up to officer Ryan. When they hear about the carjacking they come across another Navigator but in the car is Christine (the lovely Thandie Newton) and her husband Cameron (Terrance Howard). Their confrontation leaves Christine feel violated while her husband feels helpless and scared because he didn't come to his wife's aid. Officer Ryan later has another confrontation with a black woman named Shaniqua (Loretta Devine)because of his father who is ailing and he feels that his father isn't getting the adequate treatment.

Then there is the Persian store owner who runs a corner market with his wife. He buys a guy to protect the store. There is a failure of communication between him and the hispanic locksmith who came to fix the lock at his store. I loved this particular story. This was probably the most convincing story in the film. Excellent performances as well.

Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play detectives who just happens to be lovers. Frankly I found Jennifer Esposito as Ria laughable. She was as 'convincing' as a detective as Cindy Crawford was convincing as a lawyer in ""Fair Game"". Don Cheadle as Graham was excellent to say the very least. His performance was intense. I liked the portrayal of his relationship with his mother played by Nona Gaye.

The language used in the film was definitely strong and at times made me uneasy which is good. There should be more films like ""Crash"" that makes the filmgoer uncomfortable and later think. ""Crash"" is easily the best drama I have seen this year so far. The message of racial stereotypes and how easy it is for everyone of every race to make generalizations about people of other ethnicities. I would be shocked if this film does not get recognized at next year's Oscars.",1126310400,2,2769,4.7845188284518825
2360204,5,B000A3XY5A,this movie is very dramatic i really like the way the story was told  and played out its a frame tale ( a story within a story within a story )it has great acting and some parts will send chills down your back if you don't buy it at least spend 4 bucks and rent it,1126310400,,264,3.7142857142857144
2360205,3,B000A3XY5A,"I have been hearing nothing but great things about this film since it was playing in theaters. I finally had a chance to view the movie myself once released on video. It was sort of a mixed bag of.

It is a story of a group of strangers who lives collide and become emotionally intertwined.  There seems to be no real plot and the stories only seem to serve the purpose of preaching about racial stereotypes and racism. The stories of each character seems to be just thrown together just for the purpose of preaching and many of the characters seem to have no real purpose to the movie but to serve as tools for melodrama. This gives the movie a feeling of choppiness.

Some of the events Crash just seems unbelievable to buy and really makes no sense. For example, it is No spoiler to tell you that a cop picks up a hitchhiker out of the goodness of his own heart in the film. While this is not entirely unbelievable, most of us probably can't imagine this actually happening but this seems to happen just to set up something emotional for the moving.

Crash is certainly an entertaining movie but it fails at being the social commentary that it strives to be. I would actually give this one 3 and  stars. I give it below the average rating here because you never really develop an emotional attachment to any of the characters save for probably one, the character development is abrupt, and it often feels preachy with too much melodrama for its own good.",1126310400,2,1457,4.462406015037594
2360206,3,B000A3XY5A,"I agree it was powerful and emotional.  It was a bit preachy though... and some parts were, well, too melodramatic for me.  But the stories were interesting, I was especially touched by the Persian guy's story with the locksmith.  I don't think that was supposed to be the most moving story in the movie but it was for me.  I have to admit, i don't know this side of America too well... i lived in the south most of my life, where racism is the worst but has mostly gone from what you see in the movie (cops molesting women, etc) in the 60s and 70s to just segregation and people's thoughts.  Denver (where I live)has some racism but not so much.  When i moved to Denver i thought its so great that like at my high school, everone gets along fine, people hang out and race is no (or very little) difference.  It wasn't perfect but it was much better than what i knew in Tennesee.  I lived in L.A. for a little over a year (in total), but I don't know to what extent most people have these extreme racial ways of thinking.  In the movie, everyone represented one extreme or the other.  There was no one in the movie who represented a sensible, normal american trying to make it in the ""melting pot"", almost everyone (from the crooked cops, the criminal blacks, etc) represented an extreme.  I think i like the hispanic locksmith guy the most because he was just trying to help people.  He was the only one in the movie who didn't seem an ""extreme"". i talk a lot about how i dislike things that only deal in ""black and white"", ""ying and yang"", etc... but it really bugs me.  Like all the white people in the movie were either racist, evil, or killed someone.  On the other hand, a movie with normal, sensible people trying to overcome everyday problems the ""melting pot"" might bring would probably be very boring.  its just.... some of the messages of the movie, like I hated at the very end of the movie, the last scene is even someone getting hit in the rear end (car crash) and all they say is ""don't talk to me unless you speak American!"" blah blah blah.  Its stereotyping really.  Does it really happen so often ? And its sad because the movie seems to be trying to show the realities and extent of stereotyping.  I guess thats the reason i liked the story about the locksmith most, because they were just thinking, ""oh he's just a gang member, he'll sell the keys to his gang...so change the locks again!"" and then the Persian guy thought ""oh he's the one who broke in my store"", but actually he was the only normal guy in the whole movie.

Besides the drama (which was powerful and gripping), the movie seems like it was trying to show people what the racial situation is really like in the US, and i just don't fully buy it.  The movie industry too often blows things way out of proportion and then people see it, believe it, and accept it as fact.  Maybe i'm just too sheltered in my life here to see these kinds of things happening, and maybe i missed the point entirely... but thats how i felt about it.  It was still moving and will make me think a lot the next few days.  And the soundtrack was really great!  I want to watch it again sometime.  It just left me with lots of questions that i want to try to figure out.

A good movie thats dramatic + believable + touching + much better than this : City of God",1126310400,3,3320,4.280448717948718
2360207,5,B000A3XY5A,"Wow. This film really surprised me.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but it absolutely blew me away.  Original, intelligent, and complex.  The characters are fully three-dimensional and demonstrate the complexity of true human personalities.  A masterpiece.",1126224000,,255,5.8108108108108105
2360208,5,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a very intense and powerful movie and it's interwined stories is as well-paced/edited as Magnolia without being three hours long. It really dealt with racism and cultural clash in Los Angeles, and it ultimately makes the viewers realized that in a city filled with so many different ethnic backgrounds, that acceptance is the only tool to overcome discrimination regardless of the individual's skin colour and status in society. This film explore the various harsh and violent situations the characters endured and how they are changed by the aftermath of those events.

Sandra Bullock has obviously chosen to play against her sweet and cute roles, and it's refreshing to see her play an angry and arrogant snob and overt racist wife(Jean) to her nervous and  insecure D.A. husband(Rick Cabot/ Brendan Fraser). She prentends to be scared and grabs her husband's arm when she was passing by two black guys(Peter Waters/Larenz Tate and Anthony/Ludacris) on the sidewalk, and they instantly gave her a bad reaction by hyjacking her car. Jean clearly felt more superior and there's no such thing as equality in her eyes. She loudly suggested that by the way the locksmith(Daniel/Michael Pena)dressed and the tattoos that he was deemed dangerous and possibly steal the keys and gets his friends to come and gangrape her! She would eventually go from angry to mellow....

Graham Waters(Don Cheadles) is not proud of his own colour and neglects his mother and treats his fellow detective girlfriend(Ria/Jennifer Esposito)disrespectfully by labeling her as Mexican when she was part Puerto Rican and Salvatoran. He's lost touch with his brother who was misbehaving on the street and steals cars and ran over an elderly Asian man...

Matt Dillon was impressive as the corrupted racist Sgt. Ryan who made a habit of abusing his authority at innocent folks. A sussessful TV director named Cameron(Terrence Howard) and his beautiful and emotionally volatile wife(Christine/Thandie Newton) had a nasty encounter with Ryan on the road. They were pulled over by him, and he sexually assaulted her after verbally attacked the couple. Ryan's innocent rookie sidekick Officer Hanson( Ryan Phillipe) was shocked to see the misconduct. Thandie Newton's performance in this scene as well the near-fatal accident scene was by far the most striking in this film. Her rage, fear, and breakdown was so memerizing, just think best supporting actress nomination. I was very touched by the spiritual and emotional changes Dillon's character had undergone later on, even though I really hated him at first. Loretta Devine(Shariqua Johnson) stole a few scenes when she had verbal disputes with Ryan...

Shaun Toub played a Persian immigrant/grocery store owner who was obviously having some hard time ""blending"" his old ways into the American environment. I thought his segment was kind of like House of Sand and Fog, and I was reminded of the characters played by Ben Kinsley and Shorheh Adahshloo. He simply takes matters into his own hands and violence was the only solution to a bad situation....

The Asians in this film had small parts and they are depicted as alienated and angry at the more superior Whites, and even the Blacks looked down on them. The most sterotype of discrimination was to make fun of their English skills, which was so inappropiate, since most Asians speak at least two languages and English is often their second or third.

This film is very worthwhile for everyone to watch and it will change the way you treat other people of a different race. Nobody should be more superior based on their race, it's what they do that matters the most.",1126224000,,3647,5.088628762541806
2360209,5,B000A3XY5A,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was funny at times, moving at times, very unpredictable. I really enjoyed the character development in the story as well as really what the story was all about. I think many people will get many things from this movie. First of all it examines society as a whole involving the blending of our cultures, the way it pulls it off is quite fascinating. Second it really is a thought provoking movie, once it ends you'll examine your own beliefs, the reasoning behind them, I think what it really exploits is the power struggle between all cultures, what it means to be __________ color in society and how we tend to take our anger out on our own culture in everyday life without realizing the effect it has on someone else.

2360211,3,B000A3XY5A,"That's what a veteran white cop (who has just sexually molested a black woman he stopped in traffic) warns his rookie partner. That goes for the movie too. It thinks it knows what it is, but I'm not so sure.

This incident, which is supposed to be the worst ""racist"" act in the movie, shows that the filmmakers may have wanted to talk about one thing, but they wound up talking about something else too.

Supposedly it's about race in the United States, and it is. Every scene, every sentence almost, has the characters seeing the world across ""racial"" divides: white/black, Iranian/white, white/Hispanic, black/Chinese, Iranian/Arab, Chinese/Thai, and more. We're repeatedly shown characters who are discriminated against, but who find excuses to treat other minorities as though they were less than human.

But while watching all these characters you get pounded with another message too - - women are things. In this movie a woman's so-called race is often just another epithet used against her. What really makes her less than human is that she's female.

A man tells his mother on the phone he can't talk because he's ""f*****g a Mexican."" They're both police detectives - - and partners. She asks how she can be Mexican when one of her parents was Puerto Rican and one Salvadoran. She also asks, ""What kind of man says something like that to his mother?"" It turns out his mother has dementia and doesn't remember anything he says or does, but that surprise (which supposedly humanizes the male detective) doesn't make saying it like that any less degrading to his partner.

A white cop pulls an affluent black couple over and feels up the wife while making the husband beg to be let off with a warning instead of being arrested. She's just an object the cop uses against the husband, a way of saying,  ""I can violate your property - - or you - - any time I want."" Even the wife thinks of herself this way. Later she tells her husband she was outraged ""for you."" (I wonder if most women going through that kind of humiliation would feel worse about how it made their husbands feel than how it made them feel.)

The Los Angeles district attorney and his wife (both white) are car-jacked by two blacks, Anthony and Peter. Back home, Mrs. District Attorney yells at her husband about changing the locks on their house again in the morning because she doesn't trust the Hispanic locksmith ""with prison tattoos"" working on the door now. She screams at her husband, ""You're not listening to me!"" For her husband she's just an attractive appendage for campaign appearances. (Thin, with long dark hair, Sandra Bullock makes you think of the ""First Lady"" of California.)

The district attorney's wife suspects he's having an affair with an aide (who's black) and glances between the two make it look like she's right. After the D.A.'s wife has fallen down the stairs and almost killed herself, she talks to her husband on the phone. It looks like he and his aide have just had a tryst. He lets his aide know her place in his life by telling his wife he loves her in front of the aide.

The D.A.'s wife tells her Hispanic maid (who she treated like crap but who was the only one there to take her to the hospital), ""You're the only friend I've got."" We're supposed to see a domestic and an employer from different races, but what strikes you is two human beings who have something very important in common - - they're both women - - who need each other to survive.

Only one male character in this film - - the locksmith - - has a decent relationship with women. He tries to protect his little girl (physically, by moving to a neighborhood with less crime, and psychologically, by giving her something that also protects her from her fears).

Big plot twist below.

Crash has one of the most unbelievable coincidences I've ever seen in what was supposed to be a serious film and not a comic book movie. The white cop who molested the black woman in front of her husband comes on a traffic accident (the next day) where that woman is pinned under her car about to be blown up by leaking gasoline. He's the only one who can save her. At first she resists, screaming, ""Not you!"" But then, seeing she's about to die, she begs for his help. He pulls out his knife (could we get any more Freudian here?) and tells her how he's going use it to cut her loose. He saves her, she's grateful, and the white audience can let themselves sympathize with this character again. And if we can forgive him for what he's done, we can forgive ourselves for the things we're ashamed of.

There are two things I liked about Crash. First, the acting. Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Chris Bridges, and Thandie Newton are great. Big stars like Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock get to do something more than the idiotic comedies they're usually in. (Sandra Bullock has the best scene I've seen her in for years.) Tony Danza (I didn't even recognize him until halfway through the scene) gets to play both an unpleasant and (for a change) an intelligent character. Jennifer Esposito (usually stuck playing a bride of Dracula or a neo-noir gun moll) is another intelligent actor. It's easy to see why the actors wanted to be in this movie.

And if most Hollywood movies weren't crap based on ""graphic novels,"" we'd get to see more of the kind of interesting characters actors like Gloria Grahame used to play. It's dispiriting to see writers and directors of films like Following and Memento pretending that the world needs another Batman movie. (""No, really. This time we're going to get to the psychological core of the Dark Knight."") Even Quentin Tarantino treats his material more honestly, and more like the real world, despite all the swords and philosophizing assassins.

The other thing I liked is that after two hours of people crashing into each other there was a little hope at the end. The car-jacker Anthony has a chance to make a lot of money by selling some illegal Thai immigrants he finds locked in a van he stole (a lot of them near-naked women destined for the sex trade). Instead he turns them loose in Chinatown, and spends his own money to buy them food (with a racist remark to the ""Chinaman"" he gives the money to). Anthony's a hood, but not a hypocrite, and he's not going to make money from slavery.

As he tells them to get out of the truck, he prepares them for life in the United States: ""This is America. Chop chop. Time is money.""",1126224000,3,6422,4.600524475524476

2360223,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash is a good movie - not great.

Everyone in the movie tends to emote whatever they are feeling at the time, damn be the consequences. Everyone is hair-triggered.

In real life people tend to be self conscious, careful, and somewhat held back even when upset.

In real life when someone flies off the handle others around them tend to stand back, observe, and not get sucked in.

The one character in the movie that doesn't lash out - the man who's daughter was shot at - should have lashed out. In real life the shooter would have been beaten senseless.

Thus the movie is carefully crafted to yank the viewers chains

at strategic points, manipulating the results counter to our expectations.

2360224,5,B000A3XY5A,"It would be hard for you not to think that you are a racist at some point while watching ""Crash.""  In fact, one of writer-director Paul Haggis's main purposes in this 2005 film is to confront viewers with their racism, which requires you to acknowledge it as a necessary firs step.  The characters and situations are carefully constructed to the point that even the very best of characters finds their actions colored by racism.  The question then becomes what these characters will do when confronted with their own racism.

""Crash"" tells the story of a group of couples who do not know each other, but who interact with each other, both as couples and as individuals.  There is district attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito), police officers Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), a television director named Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), a shop owner named Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his daughter, Daniel (Michael Pea) the lock-smith and his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez), and Peter(Larenz Tate) and his friend Anthony (Ludacris).  I could detail the races of each character, but your knowledge of the actors and the names of the characters will tell you most of that.  Besides, you really need to just watch this movie.

The interactions between these characters leads them to do things they have never done before, and the best thing I can say about this film beyond that it makes you think is that there are very few predictable moments in it.  If anything, there are several points where you might be absolutely convinced you know what is going to happen, or at least what is being set up, but you turn out to be wrong.  The various plot threads end in different ways, some good and some bad, as connections between character you may or may not have realized are revealed.  Not everything fits together, because the pieces of ""Crash"" do not make up one large puzzle and there is not a universal answer to the question of racism.

Overall, ""Crash"" is am ambitious and thoughtful film; you can see easily see Bullock, Cheadle, and the others were attracted by the script, which was co-written by Robert Moresco (""One Eyed King"") from the story by Haggis (I fully expect this original screenplay is going to be nominated for an Oscar as much by how it plays out the intricate elements as by the value of the subject matter).  The ensemble performances are as good as you would expect, although Dillon's performance clearly stands out (and he gets more scenes than most of his castmates).  There are points in this film that do get a bit heavy handed, more in terms of the music than anything else.  I can recognize a moment that is uplifting without swelling music with religious overtones.  ""Crash"" is better when it drives home its point in a quiet moment, and while there might be moments that you think over reach, there are more than hit home.  Just be warned that this is a fairly intense film and even with a cathartic release at the end, watching ""Crash"" can be a draining experience.",1126137600,,3166,4.779816513761468

It is a strong ensemble cast's dream, ranging from the likes of Brendan Fraser to Don Cheadle.  The fragmented storyline focuses heavily on racial preconceptions and prejudices, ultimately saying that it is the person within rather than the race they have been assigned that is the important part.  Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play a district attorney and his wife whose vehicle is carjacked by Ludikris and Larenz Tate, two homeys whose preconceptions of what people think aren't too far off the target; Don Cheadle plays a cop whose younger brother has turned to a life of crime, and who finds himself involved with a Latino played by Jennifer Esposito.  Matt Dillon in one of the film's strongest performances plays a prejudiced cop who takes out his prejudices on a tv director and his wife (convincingly performed by Terence Howard and Thandie Newton) and on the HMO rep who refuses to okay further medical help for Dillon's dad.  Loretta Devine plays this character with sharp verve and although she isn't on screen a lot, she dominates when she is.  Ryan Phillippe turns in a strong nod as Dillon's partner who doesn't approve of his prejudices but finds the shoe on the other foot late in the film.  With a rare snowfall in LA a crowning climax, CRASH moves flawlessly between these storylines to deliver a compelling, if sometimes uneven, portrait of people who ""crash"" into other people's lives.",1126051200,3,1496,4.912698412698413

If you like feel good movies, or if you are easily offended, this movie is not for you.  However, if you like movies that make you think, and that are brutally honest and real, and will make you talk, then see this movie.

I would give this movie 5 stars, but if I'm rating the DVD I have to take away a star for the lack of special features.  Besides a corny intro, a music video, a bunch of trailers (but none for Crash), and a pretty good behind the scenes feature, its a bare bones dvd.  I wouldn't be shocked at all to see a Crash Special Edition come out around Christmas or shortly after.  This movie deserves two discs and a whole lot more features.",1125964800,,809,4.0125

2360245,5,B000A3XY5A,"...at least until I see something better before the end of the year.

Any movie that tells the story of several different lives intersecting (or ""crashing"") within a short time frame is nothing new to anyone who has seen films like SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA or 21 GRAHMS.  CRASH, however, raises such racial heat and tension on the streets of present day Los Angeles, that the viewer can only sit on the edge of their seat with an uncomfortable knot it their stomach, almost afraid to see what will happen next.

I saw this in the theater only this past June during it's second run when many summer blockbusters had already opened and it was nothing short of refreshing.  A real movie, real story and real acting (I hope it didn't hurt Hollywood too much).

Footnote:  Last night, it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 2005.  There IS some cimematic justice in the world!",1125964800,,865,4.577922077922078
2360246,5,B000A3XY5A,"I saw Crash over a month ago, and I've been thinking about it more and more, as recent allegations have surfaced -- suggesting that the late response to helping New Orleans, is a result of race discrimination. Crash is a movie for America -- it is a movie for the world -- it is required viewing for all of us today. It is a movie for a world where cultures are colliding as the world shrinks. The fears, biases, prejudices, and sometimes, dark hatred, are polluting our thinking, our neighbourhoods, our relationships. Crash examines this all. The movie doesn't try to paint a grim picture -- it tries to paint reality, and the results are grim. Our prejudices are so human, and while we keep them in check most of the time, they break the surface when we're stressed. That is what's happening in New Orleans, and America, right now.

Crash is set in LA, and spans 36 hours in the lives of some very diverse characters. The city district attorney and his wife; a Persian convenience store owner, his wife and his daughter; a black police detective, and his lover, a Latino police detective; a black successful television director and his wife; a Mexican locksmith and his young family; two black car-jackers with a chip on their shoulders; two white cops on the beat -- one a rookie, the other experienced and bad; a middle-aged Korean couple. Their lives over the next 36 hours will intersect -- crash. You get to see their lives, from their perspective, understanding what motivates and guides them. You see that despite their differences, they all share the same humanity, with our potential for our best, and our worst. The movie starts disconnected, with the characters being explored independently, then the crash starts. As characters collide, their responses are at times jarring -- a definite wake-up for those weened on the good guys versus the bad guys. I left the movie theatre wishing we would all have the patience to see things from another's perspective. Maybe then the world would have a little less hate, a little less intolerance. It is easy to hate when you can marginalized those you hate by their difference to you -- it's an entirely different matter when you realize that they are not so different after all.

The movie will be available on DVD on September 6th. If you missed it in the theatre, get the DVD. If there's one movie you should you watch, this is it.",1125878400,,2388,4.683333333333334

The production, the cinematography, the directing, the cast of characters, the actors involved in the film and the acting... all SUPERB.  Don't SLEEP on this America.

It was unnecessary!  Matt Dillon, calling Matt Dillon, could you play a good guy for just once! I don't think you've done this in a long time.  he is the main reason i wanted to see this, it certainly would not interest me otherwise.

This movie is full of racial slurs, and intense moments(at least I got some bit of excitement out of the torturous 2 hours).

It is one of the few movies I've seen that I wanted to walk out of. Why didn't I? I thought it would get better, and also, i was curious to see how it would all turn out.

After all the great reviews I had heard about it, maybe i had just gone into this film with high expectations.  No thumbs are risen from this movie lover.  If anything, I would put this on my list of Movies that were reviewed well but really stank.

I really want to know what it is that people liked, let alone loved about this movie. there were a lot of bad characters, a lot of car accidents, and a lot of racism.  maybe, it was too real for me.

Each character finds him/herself in a difficult personal situation (most of which in the film can be considered a PRODUCT of racial ideology/policy in the US) and in their despair they resort to  classic American behavior:  blame it on somebody else because they are ________ (insert race/ethnicity of choice, rarely white).

Haggis uses these epithets so blatantly in the first third of the film that it becomes easier and easier to dismiss it as  shallow misguided social commentary with a fumbling attempt to ""make things turn out ok.""  However, the successive brushes with death among the characters leaves them with a sobering view of how they have approached their lives in past.  It is here that the true meaning of the film takes place:  powers and circumstances far beyond human control can give a new perspective to how we see things, and in turn, treat ourselves and others.  There's stuff out there greater than just us and our little problems.

The use of race in this film is just incidental; Haggis could have just as easily had people talking about each other because they were wearing RocaWear instead of FUBU.  The way that he pulls viewers in with the tantalizing taboo of race could actually be thought of as a way to critique our unwillingness to see anything beyond a phenotype.

Buy this DVD when it comes out.  See it again.  Be thankful that you are alive.  And don't forget to explore how the cultural conditioning in this country pursuades you think that darker skin is the ""reason for all the country's ills.""",1125360000,5,1776,4.777049180327869

I am dissapointed with all the bad/stupid remarks in some of these reviews. THIS IS A MOVIE of course it is contrived and circumstantial - it is only two hours long!!

The most stupid remark goes to muhammed:

'The continuing scandal of Hollywood's Arab-bashing smells to high heaven. When are we ever going to see an arab portrayed as working class peacful citizen of the U.S.? The actor in Crash is actually Persian, but people don't know or care to know the difference between an Arab and a Persian or Iranian. We are all in the same boat. After this movie is seen by millions of people, they will come out with a warped view that Arabs are stupid punks, which is the idea that came into my mind. I know that there are arabs who are punks like the one portrayed in the movie, but there are white people and black people and asian people who are also. Why does the arab get the bad card?'

Just what part would you have liked the arab to play, the car thief?, the sex abusing cop?, the stupid shallow house wife? - infact the daughter in the arab family was a nurse or doctor and the parents ran a respectable business!!! WHat are you going on about - perhaps you should have had a part in the film! You would have fitted in nicely by the sounds of things!!

All the cast are excellent,especially Don Cheadle,matt dillon and terrence howard-excellent. Brilliant performances,just watch it,its all about different people that collide,and whats great,they change their ways throughout the film,due to the certain events that we see sometimes in everday life.

The film is big on character also,not to big,which is good. Overall great directing.great cast. Brilliant ennding. But the best thing about this film is-it deLivers a  message and makes us think .

The heaviness is even reflected in the music - which is powerful and moving throughout.

This is, indeed, a very deep and thought-provoking film. I'm am a girl so I did find myself with tears in my eyes more than once but the film should not be dismissed and ripped apart by those who see it as just another very badly thought out set of scenes - deliberately there to shock and excruciatingly false and set up.

Yes, it is unrealistic to an extent, yet for some reason I found myself thinking, 'wow, I never thought of that - that really could be the case'. And why not? What's wrong with presenting a racist cop who also happens to have family problems and be able to save lives when required? Surely that's more realistic than stereotyping him as a demon throughout?

I know some would say this is the problem - these characters and scenes are so artificially calculated that it is embarassing to watch. Well IT'S A FILM for christ sake. It's a film, just like a novel, a play - some one has carefully put it together and has reasons for doing so - whether to move an audience, disgust them or just get them thinking. So matter how realistic any film tries to be it is still not real life and has been created by a person for whatever reason. This film is perhaps less realistic because there are so many moving storylines, all shoved into 2 hours - we are overwhelmed and bombarded with lots of information and lots of issues, all at once.

What's wrong with that - the film did well - it got me thinking and I liked how it got me thinking, perhaps it opened another mind or two around the globe...",1125187200,,1850,4.366279069767442

The hostile Arab, the uptight white woman, the disgruntled black youth, the incoherent pushy Asian woman, racist L.A. cop and so forth. The only thing missing was a flamboyant or militant gay character. The storyline was held together with spit and the sequence of events was hardly believable but it keeps moving and holds your attention with strong performances all around. Had this movie been released in the seventies, moviegoers would not have blinked an eye, but in today's PC climate you could hear the gasps and sighs throughout the audience. We've become a nation of ""word police"" and thus as a whole we are much more sensitive to the harsh realities around us. The movies plays and feeds on those very sensitivities. The movie does manage to shed some balance throughout. The Arabic daughter was articulate and mild-mannered, the hispanic locksmith was portrayed in a favorable light, and Matt Dillon's character was one at odds with himself.

This is just another feel good film for the hand wringing liberal who just does not want to believe that those people of colour that are patronised on a daily basis have the same basic feelings as they do.

Take our Hispanic joiner, he does a job for a white middle class family he overhears the wife commenting how she is concerned with him having access to the house keys thinking he will make copies so his 'homeboys' can break in later.  Does he say anything? Nope.  Just gets in a huff and walks away.  He takes a job for an Iranian shopkeeper who accuses him of ripping him off when he says the door needs fixed.  He is called for everything but does our modern day saint complain?  Nope.  Then said shopkeeper thinking he has broke into his shop goes round with a gun, aims it at him and shoots his daughter!  Does he complain?  Nope just hugs his daughter and wails!

Now you or me (or any normal person)  Some nut comes round to your house and shoots your kids do you. A. call the police B. Red mist descends and pick up the nearest blunt instrument and go for him or C. Have a cry about life in general.  Seems if you are Hispanic according to this film you do C.

Then we have the Latin maid who is treated worse than an animal by same white middle class woman who when has an accident calls on her to help (which she of course does)

Again any normal person A. Step over the evil old bag and leave her there B. Call an ambulance if you can be bothered C. Do everything you can to help because hey, that's your position in life.

Seems Hispanics have replaced that old 'loyal black servant' of 1950s movies.

Then we have the Hispanic lady who is racially abused by her own boyfriend.  Does she A. Get dressed tell him to f off and die B. Punch him as hard as possible in the face nope C. Goes for a cry in the bathroom.

The point of all this is this film is just as bigoted as the bigots it is trying to examine.  The people in this film are not real, blacks and Hispanics are normal people who react just as anyone else would just as any white person would react to an offensive remark being used against them so would anyone else this is what this film does not examine, real human behavior.  People are not saints and I cant imagine anyone in their right mind tolerating the kind of abuse that the characters in this film go through without reaction and it seems that is what the whole film is hoping for, non reaction.",1123545600,3,2572,4.197556008146639

an amazing movie.

there is no way to review the movie, it uses the ability of film and images to build a web of relationships that would take a full length novel to begin to unwind.

it's about race, and racism, and what it does to people. all people. it's about history and how sometimes you can escape it but most of the time you are caught up in it's web.

gutsy, in your face, subdued preaching, the author and the director ought to get some acclaim. put your name on the dvd list and see it in the theater.",1123286400,5,564,4.128440366972477
2360326,2,B000A3XY5A,"May i personally big-up M.Nicols for his review. Spot on. This movie started intriguingly enough, but then became laughably poor. If you have never taken the time to think about race and racism in any fashion whatsoever, sure, go along to this film, in the spirit one might watch a goverment infomation broadcast, and avail yourself of the impression that racism is BAD, generally leads to BAD things happening, and that one ethnic group does not have a monopoly on racism. If you're pretty sure you 've got those points down already, don't bother.

I actually started to snigger at that bit where the kid may be shot, (i've rarely seen such sensationalistic, manipulative direction) and then couldn't contain myself and laughed out loud when Bullock fell down the stairs. To take one of many examples, is Bullock's story supposed to be somehow sympathetic or vindicate her hard-pressed maid; probably, but the maid remains a completely one-dimensional paper-cut-out of a caring, old-school feminine maternal latino woman, about whom the audience is not invited or expected to care. Plus ca change, as a pretentious person would say. Maybe the maid thought, ""what a hopeless, stingy loser my employeer is""...i know i did.

While amusing at the time, on reflection the film began to depress me acutely. I mean, what kind of state is the discourse about race and society generally in if so many people mistake this dross for incisive commentary. It reminded me of a Day Without A Mexican in that respect. Well-meaning for sure, but so artistically flimsy, and didactically platitudinous that one is simply depressed that the directors thought that this movie would contain some hard hitting points worth making. If Los Angeles is infact like this then, well, i suppose you deserve to sit through this film, but don't expect me to.

Imagine the bastard offsring of Amores Perros and Guess Whos Coming to Dinner, who has grown up with a hubristic sense of self-importance and a recent sophomoric interest in race issues, and that is this movie.",1123200000,7,2040,4.976539589442815

This is a film that deals honestly and openly with race relations, especially as played out in America.  We all harbor stereotypes, fears, judgments and yet a fascination with ""the other"" and we often do not realize just how this effects us and society as a whole.  The movie digs deep into these emotions and draws them out brilliantly in a montage of triggers that are all woven together in a period of 24 hours in L.A.

Black, white, Puerto Rican/Mexican, Arab/Persian, mixed ethnicity, you name it, it's all in here and it's refreshingly in your face.  It is for that very reason that the film is about hatred and hope, violence and redemption.  Perhaps most poignantly, it is filled with all the complexity of modern life and provides no easy answers.

You will be left speechless.  All of the actors, most well known, play roles that are against their ""types"" of roles and it is for this reason that it is perhaps so impacting and believable.  It is a brilliant piece of cinema, one that should make us all realize that sanitizing culture in the name of political correctness is a time bomb.

2360328,5,B000A3XY5A,"If Charles Dickens lived in modern-day Los Angeles, he'd be writing things very much like ""Crash."" Paul Haggis, best known for his screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby,"" exceeds that achievement with his first-ever directorial assignment, based on his own screenplay. ""Crash"" takes the currently popular device of interlocking characters in multiple plot lines to tell a panoramic, consistently compelling story about America's original sin--racism--and how it warps every individual and institution in our society. Some may complain about the proliferation of coincidence in ""Crash,"" but Haggis goes after bigger truths here, transcending mere verisimilitude of plot, and he achieves them. Here in microcosm is all the cruelty and misunderstanding in our society that is borne of racial hostility, as represented in characters of complex, sometimes repellent, but always believable humanity. ""Crash"" is an impassioned and moving plea for racial justice and harmony, but Haggis is wise enough to know that such things won't be achieved easily. The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part; the great Don Cheadle, who portrays a beleaguered police detective here, is one of the film's producers, which virtually guarantees great acting throughout. My favorites among the cast were Matt Dillon (giving the finest performance of his career) as a blatantly racist cop with unexpectedly redeeming characteristics; Terrence Howard as a wealthy African-American who gets hassled bigtime by Dillon; Michael Pena as a Latino locksmith who has a fateful run-in with an Iranian convenience store owner; and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Larenz Tate as a pair of bickering carjackers. It took guts to release such an unabashedly serious film during the summer, but ""Crash"" was worth the gamble.

Racism, sexism, accommodation by the majority, collaboration by minorities, a seemingly educated and enlightened minority who's also a thug, seemingly good people making ""safe"" decisions, and ultimately a societal collage that meshes hope with despondancy and some tragedy.

Crashed does not pontificate--it reports in a most postmodern manner--with little judgment, and with great understanding, about why we do the racist, narrow-minded, compromising things that we do.

The atmosphere was dark, and the tempo was tense, but deliberate--not rushed.  The acting was superb--passionate, yet not shrill, not unrealistic.

Bottom-line:  Crashed allows you to draw your own conclusions as it displays a subtley tribalistic society awash in the grayness of situational ethics.  Fascinating, and, for me, quite sad.",1122508800,2,1128,5.517441860465116
2360342,5,B000A3XY5A,"and the only time they come into contact is by crash'.  And with these words Paul Haggis tears open the box of CRASH, one of the most searingly vital and important films of the year.  This is a film that explores prejudice, racism, fear, hate, bigotry, random violence and all of those barriers we people of the cities have erected to isolate ourselves from the miscegenated world in which we live.  In Haggis' hands every possible form of miscommunication based on ignorance and transference of self-loathing is woven together in a story that mixes Caucasian, African American, Asia, Persian, Hispanic conflicts and lifestyles and the concurrent disruption of world views gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision.

Every character in this well-crafted script eventually confronts every other character in ways that are at times coincidental, at times, tangential, and at other times the direct result of prior confrontations.  African Americans bully each other over their own prejudices, Caucasians belittle their Hispanic workers and are the first to point the finger at the 'tattooed gangsters' who in reality are innocent tradesmen, Persians terrorized on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority suspects, redneck racist policemen thrash out at African Americans in response to their own personal family demons that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie cops who metamorphose into like habits.  Every form of prejudice and hate is encountered and none of the characters is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim.  It is as though the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto you' has been hideously transformed into a reason for violence.

Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the largest parts to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful.  And some of the actors heretofore know as B actors rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis' knowing direction.  Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard (here is a star!), Thandie Newton, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Larenz Tate, Loretta Devine (extraordinary!), Beverly Todd, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena (who delivers the most affecting scene in the film), Shaun Toub, Yomi Perry, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Tony Danza, William Fichtner - indeed, the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos.

People leave the theater stunned, tearful, informed, and incredulous, so great is the impact of this film.  Much or that impact is aided by the brilliantly creative cinematography of James Muro and Dana Gonzales and by the powerful musical score by Mark Isham.  This is quite simply one of the finest films of the year by anyone's standards.  For those critics who descry Haggis' lack of providing 'Redemption' for the characters, this viewer would take offense: every character is altered either tangentially, directly, or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH.

2360343,5,B000A3XY5A,From the moment I walked out of the movie theater this movie was a classic to me. It is the most racial movie I have ever seen but it does it in such a real form that made sense to me. There were common accusations in this movie about every race it is so true to society that Crash just blew me away. If you did not or do not like this movie it is because after it you realized how much like them you actualy are,1121990400,4,412,3.7471264367816093
2360344,4,B000A3XY5A,"When Paul Haggis was 47 years old, in 2000-he walked away from a lucrative career as a television writer-and he began to court the 900 lb behemoth of Feature Films. He bought up the rights for some boxing short stories-and out of that MILLION DOLLAR BABY emerged golden. But prior to that-he and his partner, Bobby Moresco, developed CRASH. Haggis was originally slated to direct BABY, but CRASH was still in post-production-and the rest is Eastwood and Oscars.

The movie opens up with a crash-that we don't hear, like a silent scream. Don Cheadle does a remarkable job as Detective Graham Waters. After the accident, he wanders into a crime scene-that had jammed up the road. He recognizes the body. Fade out-prologue as epilogue-and it worked well. Perhaps, Haggis was inspired, in part by Cronenberg's 1996 film, CRASH-a car crash sexy cult film. It postulated that there is a connection between the violence of a car crash and the passion of the sexual act.

This new film is a Robert Altman-like cross-cutting storyline kind of film-juggling several characters and several scenarios-that at some point all touch each other. Cheadle's character surmised that the is so little sense of touch in the big city-that people just have to crash into each other in order to induce it. It is about prejudice-racism, sexism, elitism, and several other kinds. It is about being too many millions in a small space-about the madness of urban cohabitation.

Matt Dillon gave one of his best performances as Sgt. Ryan, LAPD-as a conflicted patrol officer that presented the world is hard shell, his arrogance, and his abuse of his constabulary position. Perhaps the streets made him that way-cost him a marriage and friends. But he, also, had a heightened sense of duty that could seem impervious to danger-and an earnest willingness to perform those duties. This film elevates Dillon to a new dramatic status.

Sandra Bullock played Jean Cabot-the snotty trophy wife of LA's District Attorney. Her conceit and judgmental manner left her few redeeming qualities-but like many others in the film, circumstances dictated that she ultimately behave in a way contrary to our first impression of her. Brendan Fraser played DA ""Rick"" Cabot. He found just the right amount of good looks, political machinations, and insincerity posting as sincerity-and poor ethnic attitudes buried behind closed doors. Thandie Newton gave a powerful performance as Christine-the light-skinned loud-mouthed wife of a black TV director. Terrence Howard played Cameron-the black TV director. He did a terrific job of conveying the torment of having to face his own tokenism. His frustration and anger nearly costs him his life when he has a mixed-up run in with the LAPD. This strong principal performances were well supported by Ryan Phillipe, Larenz Tate, Ludacris, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, William Fichtner, Jennifer Esposito, Keith David, and Tony Danza.

I found this film to be audacious and fearless-and tremendously thought-provoking and entertaining-as well as ambitious. I loved it for its challenge as well as its several messages.",1121817600,7,3107,5.181274900398407

2360346,3,B000A3XY5A,"Crash falls into the genre of film that might be called, ""Intersecting Lives in LA,"" which includes movies such as Shortcuts, Magnolia and Grand Canyon (all better films than this in my opinion; Grand Canyon deals with some of the same racial issues).  While always interesting, and with some good performances, Crash is ultimately too contrived and single-minded to be convincing. To really fall under the film's spell, you have to overlook some unlikely coincidences and accept that almost every scene and conversation is about basically the same thing --racial and ethnic stereotyping. Real life is, fortunately, more complicated than this. As for coincidences, there is one in particular that stretches the limits of credibility. A confrontation between a racist cop (Matt Dillon) and a black couple is followed by another scene that takes place only hours later in which the same people run into each other, providing a dramatic opportunity for a lesson to be learned by both parties. Considering that the film takes place in Los Angeles, the most populated city in America, and whose police force must number in the thousands, this is simply too farfetched to be believed.

  The film's exploration of ethnic stereotyping is certainly an important and compelling theme. The notion of moral ambiguity is also covered in an interesting way. We see how someone like the Matt Dillon character can be an obnoxious bigot in one area of his life and a caring son in another. Yet this theme starts to feel heavy-handed after a while, as one scene after another drives home essentially the same points. The film could also be accused of reinforcing certain stereotypes that it is asking us to question. A pair of black car-jackers engage in sometimes amusing but cliched dialogue; a Middle Easterner is driven to an act of violence; an Asian woman with a heavy accent yells hysterically at strangers. The technique here is to show a character as an ethnic stereotype and then have them do something that surprises us by being inconsistent with the image we have formed of them. This works to some extent, but when the same issues and devices are stressed to the exclusion of all other aspects of life, the result is a little one-dimensional.",1121558400,4,2238,4.96
2360347,5,B000A3XY5A,"I just had a delectable visual and mental treat from Paul Haggis. Crash, is a well-crafted story. From the opening scene of a car collison, the film unfolds to weave several stories to form an intricate web of inter-related events involving the beautifully drawn characters. The basis of the story might have been racial discrimination and stereotyping but beneath this surface, it's really an emotionally-charged collision of unearthed feelings, contradictive thoughts and the emotional freedom that people sometimes deny themselves by refusing to confront reality. Several of the heart wrenching scenes are so beautifully shot that the viewer is almost transposed into the movie itself.

Although most of the actors have minimal screen time due to the various stories, the acting is consummate. Don Cheadle is shaping to be a great character actor as his display of emotions is so intense that you feel him. Ludacris, the rapper (whose music I couldn't care less), also shows promise in his big screen debut.

For me, I identify most with Sandra Bullock's character, a heavily repressed and unhappy socialite who was robbed at gunpoint with her husband (Brendan Fraser). When her character said, ""I am upset but it's not because of the carjack. I wake up feeling like this every morning. I am angry but I don't know why."" And she falls off the stairs shortly after, only to arrive at the realization of the people and things that matter most.
I am deeply surprised by how well the little stories intertwine so flawlessly to present a thought-provoking film. Certainly one of my three favorite movies of 2005 following Closer and Sommersturm (Summer Storm).

I urge everyone to see Paul Haggis' Crash and experience 2 hours of feeling again. Oh ya, listen to the mesmerising music score that accompanies the film! (A)",1121472000,25,1818,5.053333333333334
2360348,4,B000A3XY5A,"Many other people have reviewed the screenplay, plot, and acting of the film so I'll focus on my own personal opinion.

Interesting aspects of the film:

1.  This film should be seen at the theatre among a multiethnic audience just to experience the wide-ranging, race-dependent reactions.  In certain scenes where characters behave in ways traditionally seen as ""racist,"" white people will cringe and feel awkward while minorities will laugh knowing that they've experienced similar situations or because they have their own racially-nuanced interpretations.  In other scenes (e.g., where a black character makes fun of Latinos), white people will laugh outloud knowing that it is socially acceptable to do so because other minorities are laughing and because it is not a white character doing the ridiculing.

2.  This film is dominated by the discussion of the race -- not the superficial race treatment you get from a Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker film but a relentless, in-your-face, cerebral, all-consuming serving of race.  This type of film from Hollywood, unfortunately, is extremely rare, especially given that race may be the most defining issue in America.  The last film that raised these issues so thoroughly was Spike Lee's Bamboozled, and this film was also a ""great idea but flawed"" type of film.  Most importantly, white people may feel uncomfortable being confronted with race throughout the movie but what they should realize is that, for minorities, every day is like ""Crash.""  Not that we experience theatrical discrimination and prejudice every day, but everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, we perceive on a daily basis is through race-tinted glasses.

3.  The scene where Ryan Phillipe takes a brave stand and prevents what would have likely been the LAPD shooting down Terrence Howard needlessly is, for me, representative of thousands of similar situations that occur every day where people can make a difference if they act with courage.  Unfortunately, I think most people wouldn't have acted as Phillipe's character did.

Flaws with the movie:

1.  A bit contrived in how the people's lives are intertwined but I'll let that go since there is a certain suspension-of-disbelief that must be undertaken.

2.  There is still a certain amount of Hollywood white liberalism that pervades the movie.  Although most races are represented in the film, it still centers around the black/white dynamic.  There are Iranian/Persian characters in the movie, but if this movie had been made before 9/11, I doubt that the filmmakers would have even considered this element.

3.  As an Asian American, I believe that Asians got the short shrift in terms of the portrayals.  Sure, most races got positive/negative treatments in the movie, but Asians generally were portrayed negatively:  (1) the squawking Asian woman with the terrible accent, (2) another token Asian man who's only time on screen is to get run over by a car and then reveal himself, disfigured in the hospital, to be a human trafficker, and (3) then all the Southeast Asian trafficking victims found in the van.  I might actually have been more angry had it not been for the token ""decent"" Asian American portrayed, with maybe 10 seconds of screen time, in the role of the insurance claims agent (or was he a detective?).

4.  The scene with the Latino man and his daughter and the talk of the guardian angel was a little too cloying.

Overall, it is a movie that still must be seen because everyone will have their own different interpretation.",1120953600,2,3519,5.092495636998255
2360349,5,B000A3XY5A,"This movie, ""Crash"" has so many layers. On one layer, it's a study on racism and racial attitudes in the U.S. On another layer, it's an interlocking series of tragedies and revelations about individual human beings who inter-act with each other.

One thing this movie is NOT is any sort of sermon or political tract. Which is what makes the movie so effective. As a viewer, I cared passionately for each of the characters. They are all in shades of ""gray,"" no absolutes in any of them. Which is what makes the characters -- and this film -- so compelling.

2360362,5,B000A3XY5A,"I loved this film for all its unapologetic, unmasked, raw emotions that took me through a roller-coaster of complicated interactions between lives intertwined in the City of Angels. It's a story about the deluded, the damaged, the proud and broken pieces in all of us and how we project them on each other and interpret them when projected upon us. A powerful concept that's executed extremely well with an all-star cast and an impeccable production.

The movie follows the story of several characters of different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds through the course of a couple of days. As the events unfold, paths are crossed and and at times end as lives change course and souls seek reasons that make sense of it all.

The ensemble cast is superb. Matt Dillon delivered a stellar performance playing a racist cop with a soft, caring side. Ryan Phillippe was also great playing a straight, clean-cut cop that makes a bad turn down the road. Ryan's character, to me, represents the collective American psyche that absorbs tension and conflict on daily basis as a result of simple human interactions and keeps them locked inside until they fester and burst in a split second changing everything.

The soundtrack is worth getting as well. ""In The Deep"" by Bird York is ever haunting and the Stereophonics' ""Maybe Tomorrow"" is just an excellent song with relevant lyrics.

The movie doesn't try to answer any questions. It's simply displaying a slice of life in the big city in current day America. For all of you living in a non-monolithic society, go see this film. It's worth your time.",1120262400,3,1592,4.885185185185185

The film really does a great job of bringing all of the characters together. As you watch this, you'll see that all of the characters in this film are connected in some way. It really is interesting to sit and figure out how.

This is one of those few movies where, just like Cinderella Man, the acting is sensational from everyone. I was especially surprised with Ludacris. From what I saw before I saw this movie, he seemed like a gangster just saying racist things and committing crimes. But, my perspective really changed after I saw it. He really has a lot of depth and emotion inside of him and his last scene is terrific.

Don Cheadle once agains hits another home run performance. The academy really has to give him an Oscar nom. for this.

Matt Dillon (the cop) is the character whom I had the strongest feelings toward. He has moments in this film of mean racism and moments of total heroism. He almost plays two different characters. His first scene when he ""feels up"" an African-American women by pulling her over is incredibly filthy and you feel hatred and dismay toward the character.

2360365,4,B000A3XY5A,"There are nine million stories in New York City. In Los Angeles, there's just one, and we're all a part of it.

The degrees of separation dwindle from six to two. Love, hate, crime, virtue, defeat, triumph -  it's all part of the same soup in the desert under hazy skies. The best Los Angeles movies - ""Chinatown,"" ""LA Confidential,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Short Cuts"" - express that theme with large casts, a wide canvas, a feast of subplots and an operatic scheme.

""Crash"" isn't quite cut from that cloth, but it belongs in the conversation, especially now that it's won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Writer-director Paul Haggis investigates racism under admittedly contrived, sensational circumstances, where villains become heroes and vice versa in one day. But the writing is strong and fierce, and the conflicts, while hyperboles, underline what's really going on out there - we're all pretty ticked off, nursing certain wounds, equally capable of cruelty and sympathy depending on who or what irritates that ulcer of discontent. Consider the characters long enough, and a more classic theme emerges - good vs evil, sin vs charity. Haggis is smart enough to know racism is a symptom, not the disease. Over two hours he slowly proves it.

The large ensemble includes Don Cheadle as a homicide detective, an unfavored son to his heroin-addicted mother; Matt Dillon as a racist cop watching his father die because of a crooked HMO; Ryan Phillippe as his partner; Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as an upscale black couple targeted by Dillon's character one late night; Brendan Fraser as a too-race-conscious district attorney; Sandra Bullock as his trophy wife; Larenz Tate and Ludacris as carjackers ; and William Fichtner, in one of those deal-with-the-devil roles of sublime corruption in the name of sensible politics. They mix, sometimes violently, curse and grapple, even redeem one another. The plot is cleverly spun, if a bit mythical, and worth discovering in the theater.

Cheadle is the lead; though the cast is billed alphabetically, only Cheadle wanders through the entire picture. He's excellent again, cool, intellectual, at a distance from his family and his partner (Jennifer Esposito), who doubles as his lover. Not unlike other characters in ""Crash,"" there is one thing particularly important to him, and his flaws keep him from quite protecting it. The same with Dillon's cop - he means well with his father, but his ""white man's lament"" so damages relations with the black HMO manager (Loretta Devine) that it nullfies his good intent. Newton and Bullock, in smaller roles, illuminate the necessity for marginalized wives to express the anger their prominent husbands cannot. They're victims/villains, in a sense, able to articulate but not act, powerless in a structure that favors the male code of business.

Nearly every major character, save one Latino locksmith(Michael Pena), seems to harbor some unjustified prejudice, and one of the weaknesses of ""Crash"" is that they speak of these in such blunt, vicious words. But it's also a strength: While racism in the 21st Century is subversive enough that we've developed ways of executing our prejudice without resorting to slurs, Haggis knows that, in a movie, a flashpoint must precede substance if it's going to reach a wide audience. A gotcha before the insight.

By the end Haggis has taken us through enough of these gotchas that we can telegraph the  ""surprise"" twist, involving what was previously the movie's most upstanding, idealistic character. And I don't much buy that scene, sad and jarring as it is. But by that point you're wrapped up in ""Crash,"" in its barking performances, Mark Isham's somber score and night setting, so that you reflect on a world whose misfortune, among others, is to fear what we don't know or understand, instead of embracing what we can.

""I wake up angry every morning,"" Bullock's character says at one point, and it's a summary statement for the whole tangled web. Directing it toward a skin tone or a foreign accent seems pretty dumb but, of course, when you're happy, waking up angry every morning does, too.",1119225600,,4129,5.060294117647059
2360366,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" forces each of us, no matter what race we are to examine the inner prejudices, misconceptions and stereotypes we have against those who are different from us. It even confronts and corrects our own self denial about all of the above mentioned factors. It is a portrayal of the ""new"" America, it's new and many different groups and the way we relate to each other and the unique issues and challenges each confronts on an almost daily basis in this great country. It is impossible NOT be affected by this film unless you were sleeping.

All actors did marvelous jobs, especially Matt Dillon. We  have seen Dillon play ""bad"" guys before, but in this movie, even if he is supposedly on the ""right"" side of the law, he is downright scary in this movie.

Don Cheadle again shows us why he is a fast rising star with a stellar performance as an L.A. detective with his own personal issues to deal with.

I can also go on and say this is like ""21 Grams"" and to a degree, ""Traffic"", where each person's lives in the film intersect at one point, either through good or bad deeds. Go see this film!

When I first sat down and the light went out I thought that it would be another sterotypical black on white; white on black racism movie and what I found, was a deeply involved, undeniable, mind blowing expereince. I live in the inner city, I have my whole life, and not once have I ever seen what really happens - I mean what really happens between groups of people displayed so perfectly. Each character gives you something to feel for, something to hate, something to love and something to find within yourself that makes you relate to them. Not just the bad guys but the good ones as well. Each character is so ""human"" that it hits so deep within at certain points in the movie. Anyone who saw it can agree. To take a movie beyond Hollywood, beyond racial guidelines, and further past the sterotypes that you actually get the truth is what people need to see. To sit in a dark movie theater and hear the laughs, the gasps, the cries, and to feel what every other person in that movie theater feels is the signs of a great movie. It would be a crime for this movie to be overlooked (as it probably will be) at the oscars.

2360371,5,B000A3XY5A,"The movie begins at night in Los Angeles, with two detectives (Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito) arrving at the scene of a homicide. Another car rear ended them, though, and Esposito's character begins exchanging racial epithets with the older Asian woman who drove the other car as Cheadle walks over to the crime scene. From there, the film flashes back to yesterday and the events leading up to the homicide. These two days are racially tense, violent, thought-provoking and, at times, incredibly sweet. Through chance meetings, each of the characters crosses the paths of the others, learning of each other's prejudices and dealing with their own. This large ensemble cast works incredible magic using an intelligent, racially charged script from writer/director Paul Haggis (who also wrote the script for Million Dollar Baby). And when I say large ensemble cast: Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Loretta Divine, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Marina Sirtis (for all you fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation), Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Ludacris, Daniel Dae Kim (for the fans of Lost), Tony Danza, and Terrence Dashon Howard. My favorite performances came from Michael Pena and Ashlyn Sanchez who played father and daughter who moved from the bad part of town to get away from the gangs. So many things were happening in the film, but I never felt lost for one moment. I felt right along with the characters and, at times, could even see myself having said some of the same things.

2360373,5,B000A3XY5A,"In some of the early reviews I read of this movie, many critics said, ""It's the kind of movie that gets you talking afterwards.""  I frequently scoff at such things, because so often the subtext is...""This is a movie that will make you angry at some group / type of person and you'll want to take action.""  I don't really want my movies to force a point of view down my throat.  But the cast was too good to pass up, so my wife and I went.

Well, for a few hours after the movie, our conversation was about little other than the issues, emotions and ironies that this movie brought up.  We enjoyed it thoroughly, found it original and riveting, well made and thought provoking.

It's a script full of intersecting stories.  We meet a bunch of different people, from different races, different backgrounds, different socio-economic standings.  Their own personal problems fuse with their racial attitudes, and with one dizzying but convincing coincidence after another, their stories intersect in often violent, never predictable ways.

You've probably heard that the movie has a lot to say about race...and it certainly does.  That is on its mind more than anything else.  But it makes racial attitudes personal.  We don't feel any character is speaking for a group or type...they are themselves, individuals.  White characters make slurs against Latinos.  Blacks against Asians.  Asians against Hispanics.  Hispanics against blacks.  Every possible combination.  Some characters never learn to rethink their prejudices, others have them affirmed and still others have them shaken abruptly loose.

I won't try to detail specific plot items.  Suffice it to say that we cover a short period of time in and around the Los Angeles area, and the various families, individuals, police partners, etc.  get jumbled around in an amazing but easy to follow sequence.  Although the plotting is very complicated, IT IS NEVER HARD TO FOLLOW.  Paul Haggis, writer/director (writer of MILLION DOLLAR BABY), takes us through the movie simply and crisply.

There is one plot development, involving a little girl, her locksmith father and a Persian shopkeeper that packs a huge, HUGE punch when it reaches its climax.  I heard audible gasps from the audience and, no exaggeration, a couple of sobs too!  Another great moment comes when the characters played by Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton collide for a second time.  It's a moment of great tension and though few words are exchanged, amazing things happen to the characters emotionally.

Other moments involved incredible twists of irony, such as the amusing and violent story arc for the car-jacker played by Ludacris.  Almost no story goes where you expect it to.  Each story is equally involving.  There is not really a wasted moment in the movie...it is boiled down to its essence, yet it feels somehow epic and all-embracing...kinda like SHORT CUTS or MAGNOLIA.

There are also many remarkable performances.  Matt Dillon might be Oscar nomination worthy.  Thandie Newton, generally a supremely annoying performer (see E.R. or Mission Impossible II) has her acting quirks put to proper use here, and her final scene with Dillon, as I said, is a doozy.  Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play Detective partners, and they create some great sparks.  Cheadle really is a terrifically versatile performer, and here we sympathize with him at times and hate him at times...kinda like many people we might know in real life.  Sandra Bullock has a small but juicy role, a departure from her usual personality, and an indication that maybe Miss Congeniality roles shouldn't be where her career is headed.  Brendan Frasier uses his typically bland exterior in the role of District Attorney to portray a politician who knows where he stands with all his constituents and knows exactly how to get others to do his dirty work.  And although many, many other actors are stellar in the movie and I can't list them all here, I do want to give special note about Ludacris, who is thoroughly convincing in a part that requires some delicate shadings of character.  Here's another hip-hop star who appears to be the real deal when it comes to acting.

The movie is R-rated, and it deserves to be.  Language is pretty harsh, and the themes are harsher.  It NEEDS to be seen by thinking adults, because it has the power to make you evaluate yourself, to turn the spotlight on your own attitudes.  It's also so well-written and acted that I hope it gets remembered come Oscar time.  It's the year's best movie so far.",1118016000,4,4533,4.9378306878306875
2360374,5,B000A3XY5A,"I had no idea what Crash was about before heading to the movie theater...only that it was controversial. The subject of this movie is one that makes you stop and think about your own interactions with people of various races. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...it's probably the best one I've seen this year (and I hope it wins some awards).

Like another reviewer said....it's hard to talk more about the movie without giving  plot points away. Whatever you do, don't dismiss it...see it right away...it's money well spent.",1117843200,2,523,4.931818181818182
2360375,5,B000A3XY5A,"This is a movie everyone needs to see. Not just that I would recommend to everyone, but that every person in America needs to see. Period. I don't think I've ever said that about a film before, but I can't stress it enough with ""Crash"": even if you never go to the theater, if you see only one movie the entire year, see this one. The makers of ""Crash"" clearly have a thorough, nuanced understanding of race and racial conflict, not often seen even in this day and age of increasing racial awareness. Racism in the United States is not gone, but it often works in more subtle and insidious ways than in the past. Subconscious fears and prejudices can rise to the surface in moments of stress and cause conflict even where none was intended, and ""Crash"" explores the way this social dynamic impacts the lives of everyone in a community. It dives into the world of racial conflict like no other film I've seen.

""Crash"" takes place in L.A. and opens, appropriately, with the scene of a minor car accident. A Black police officer, Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle), and his Hispanic partner (Jennifer Esposito) have been rear-ended by an hysterical Asian woman. We find out later in the film why she comes so unhinged at this moment, but at the time it is not apparent and as she vents her frustration on the police officers, sparking an exchange of racial slurs. A more ominous tone is cast over the film with the discovery of a young man's dead body in the bushes along the roadside a short while later. From here we are taken back in time to the previous day, from where we see the events leading up to the car crash and the dead boy unfold.

One of the most saddening aspects of the film, for me - even more than the overt expressions of racism - was seeing how the process of victimization and humiliation forms a ripple effect, causing additional tension and strife between family members. This can be seen most clearly through the characters played by Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. The black couple is pulled over on the street one evening by a white police officer (Matt Dillon), who proceeds to sexually harass the wife. The husband is torn, knowing that if he protests, the cop will most probably make the situation even worse for them. Yet his wife feels betrayed, seeing her husband simply stand by while she is humiliated. Afterward, rather than being able to comfort each other, as they need, the two find themselves erupting into painful argument with one another. This instance of racism, perpetrated by a stranger external to their life together, threatens to tear their marriage apart. We see tension just as real, though different in tone, between the upper-class white couple Jean and Richard Cabot (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser), as Jean struggles to deal with the repercussions of her own prejudiced views.

I don't mean, however, to give anyone the impression that the movie is entirely depressing. While sobering, it also contains element of hope. We see several characters undergo transformation over the course of the film, as they come to a deeper understanding of the consequences their attitudes and actions have on themselves and those they interact with. Particularly touching is the epiphany experienced by Sergeant Ryan (Matt Dillon), though we also see profound awakenings in the characters played by Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, and Shaun Toub. In fact, every character undergoes some degree of change, and none are the same at the end of the story as they were at its beginning. The acting all-around in this ensemble cast is superb, making the emotional journeys of its characters that much more accessible to its audience.

Another thing that particularly impressed me about the film is its incorporation of characters from a wide variety of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. We see both professional and working class individuals. We also see characters who are Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Middle Eastern. In a society where racial issues are often oversimplified into a basic Black-White dichotomy, ""Crash"" is a refreshing and eye-opening dose of reality. The only major racial category that is completely unrepresented is the Native American community. I was also pleased to see that the film does not resort to the trite conciliatory method of making any one group appear entirely virtuous or entirely corrupt. Within the members of each racial group we see both admirable and reprehensible characters. Indeed, even within the same character there often appear both admirable and reprehensible traits.

Though I have countless good things to say about the film, the reality is that one simply has to see it for oneself. It brings with it a much-needed awareness of the dynamics of the American racial milieu. Some other reviewers have argued that the movie makes racism out to be a bigger problem than it actually is, but this is just the type of misconception that ""Crash"" seeks to correct. Race and racism remain a powerful element of today's society. Unfortunately, there are many who do not realize this, and also many well-intentioned individuals who perpetuate the cycle of racism through behaviors that they do not even recognize as discriminatory. ""Crash"" highlights all these issues and dissects the issue of racism in a very clear and moving way. Once again, I urge everyone most strongly to go see this film at the earliest opportunity.",1117843200,4,5425,4.911668484187568

It struck me as the brainchild of a liberal-minded filmmaker with no real profound experiences to base his ideas on. The dramatics are a bit over the top and the characters and situations just seemed false to me. As usual in Hollywood, everything gets boiled down to black vs white. All the other races seem to only be there for appearance's sake. I can't fathom how one could even suggest to be making a film about LA racial issues without giving the Hispanic experience a significant voice. And Asians only exist for a brief moment as a tool to make a black guy a hero (all while he's cracking the same stupid old asian jokes that are only okay to laugh at when a smartass young black guy is saying them). I found some aspects of the film interesting, but for the most part its just a good example of the hypocrisy, ignorance, and condescension of liberal Hollywood.",1117756800,6,930,4.476470588235294

""Crash"" is a film that looks intelligently at a fearful post-911 world and the intersection of different character lives and takes on every stereotype imaginable and moves its audience on a cerebral and emotional journey that few films try but rarely succeed.  As I watched the film I kept thinking it was going to dissolve into sweet sentimental, ""Gosh-how-awful-we-are-as-a-human-race.""  ""Why-can't-we-all-just-love-each-other-and-get along"" and ""We-shouldn't-judge-each-other"" and although it may appear to approach that line it never crosses it.  With all the many blatant abuses of people in ""positions of power"" in this movie it make you mad as an audience member.

Kudos to director Paul Haggis for taking on the risks so rarely tried in today's tired cinematic world and pulling it all off beautifully.  A film to be remembered come Oscar and Golden Globe time, because there is not a weak performance in this entirely ensemble cast.  It is so much more than your average ""slice of life"" movie.  In the end, ""Crash"" doesn't tie everything nice and neat, everybody still faces their demons, situations and problems.  Clearly showing how difficult at times these characters and our own lives really are.

2360381,3,B000A3XY5A,"It was an ok movie (about 75 % of it anyway). It is a movie that shows the flaws with ourselves and reflects on racial prejudices in our society. I don't think we need a movie to show us this though, we all know its there, but we choose not to fix the problem. I liked the movie, it was interesting, it had several separate stories which eventually tied in together. The main point of this movie was to show us just how stupid racism is. My problem with the movie is started playing out like a farfetched after school special. The movie got very unrealistic as it got closer to the ending. Without getting into too many details, for people who haven't seen it: you will see scenes where you will say to your self ""Yea, Like that guy just HAPPENS to show up at this time so he can learn a lesson about himself"" or you will say ""Yea right, like that would happen, what are the chances?"" To me this aspect of the movie was cheesy. As I was watching the movie, I did hope the stories all would tie together, but I was hoping for something a little more realistic. Cops letting crooks go, and thugs changing their minds about stealing was just laughable to me. The movie had a good point to make, but we all know what the point is in the first 15 minutes of the film. Even though I thought it was an ok movie, I probably wouldn't sit through it again. I definitely wouldn't let children see it with all the racial language in it, and I would not see it if I was going to the theater to be entertained. Movies should be a thrill ride, like a ride at the amusement park: exciting, emotional, moving. I just don't think this movie is any of these. It is one of those movies that says ""look how bad you are"" and at times is depressing, and very stereotypical. Some people may leave the theater mad, which is not the intended point of the movie. Some people might leave depressed, or frustrated. This movie is like watching the evening news.

2360392,5,B000A3XY5A,"""Crash"" is the kind of movie that makes you think. Not the deep kind of thinking that ""I Heart Huckabees"" or ""Royal Tenenbaums"", or even ""Rushmore"" made you do. It is not the movie that makes you feel bad about yourself like ""Sideways"" (although a great movie, it made you think about the bad things you do, didn't it?), but it does make you feel like the experiences happening to these characters are hapenning to you. Perhaps it is that the characters are set up so well that we feel as if we know them, or maybe it is how intimately the movie is shot. The movie is filmed with each character either leaning against or near the camera, and the movie stays away from the rather cliched act of looking into the camera and talking (""Alfie"", or even a good movie like ""High Fidelity""). This may seem annoying to people, and you may say ""Why would I want to see people leaning on the camera?!"" Well, it's done in a very artsy way. The characters talk to one another, and it seems that it is rare that two characters involved in a conversation are in the same frame. The movie is also admirable for not running on too long. It runs a curt 103 minutes, and it feels like it's about an hour. On a completely different note, the movie has some great action scenes. Not the kind of action scenes that a dumb movie like ""xXx: State Of The Union"" would have, things blowing up and people getting shot, but scenes of action that have characters crashing their cars into each other. There are no incredible gun fights, gun violence, but no twenty minute gun fights. There's no fantastic samurai sword fights (no, there's no Uma in a yellow jumper thing). What there is is a good, no, great, movie that dabbles into the rather risque subject of racism. There can be a movie like ""White Chicks"" that makes fun of racism, but it is hard to be serious about the subject without being blasted by people and critics. The movie at times is funny, but not overly funny. It's more of a dark comedy/drama. A very dark comedy. The kind of accidic humor that ran rampantly through Alexander Payne's ""Election"" and Todd Solondz's ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"". Writer/director Paul Haggis finally makes a film that people notice. Yes, he did make the inferior ""Million Dollar Baby"", or more commonly known to me as the following three: ""Maggie Fitzgerald We Love You: A Musical"", ""Oh Lord Where Did My Tongue Go?"" "" or my personal favorite ""Thanks Mrs. Unlicensed Chripractor Whose Name Sounds Like A Bad Beer, That's The Way To Step On My Neck! Oww! Too Hard!"" But what I'm saying is that I'm glad to see that he has finally made a movie that people are recieving so well. Not everybody like ""M$B"", but many seem to love this movie. Some are taking the message of the movie too seriously. It's a movie about people changed by their actions, and by the end of the movie they are better people. They will never be great people, or honest people like you or me, but they have learned a lesson and they slowly learn to be kinder to people.

""Crash"", which takes place over a 36 hour period, is about fourteen people who are, to some varying degree, racist. Jean (Sandra Bullock), and her husband Rick (Brendan Fraser) walk along a downtown street late at night. Passing a couple of African American me, Jean inadvertantly takes Rick's arm. They assume it an act of racism, and soon carjack the couple. The friends, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate), are nice guys, but at some point they ended up doing the wrong thing, and now they have to do more wrong stuff to cover the last thing. We are more or less forced to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jean and Rick, who is the District Attorney, are a nice couple, a rather rich couple, but Jean is rather hard to put up with. When installing locks on their house, a Latino locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pina), takes a little too long installing the locks for Jean. She asks when he'll be done, then goes to her husband and starts yelling about he will go out and give their house key to his ""homies"", and that they'll be ransacked by morning. A parralel plot line follows two cops, Hansen (Ryan Phillippee) and Ryan (Matt Dillon). Ryan is a racist, and when the call comes in to pull over a black Navigator, Ryan pulls over the wrong one just because an interracial couple is fornicating. The couple, Christine (Thandie Newton) and Cameron (Terrence Dashon Howard), were in fact conoodling, but Ryan takes it one step further, fondling Christine under the guise of feeling her down to make sure she has no weapons. Cameron, a TV director, has to deal with racism even at his work place, like when Tony Danza tells him that an African American character in the show ""Does not sound black enough"". Another plot line folllows Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner/girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Espiosito). Graham, a police investigator, can never seem to get Ria's race correct. The movie actually starts out with Graham and Ria getting in a car accident and Graham investigating a murder. Graham's mother is always asking him to bring his brother home. His brother has not been seen for a while, and Graham, although worried about him, does not play into his mothers fears, probably to calm her. A lesser plot line, one that could have been deleted completely, is about a Persian store owner and his family, and his purchasing of a gun to protect himself. The most didturbing scene in the movie revolves around his character, but the whole sequence is still needless and rather stupid.

Even though the subplot about the Persian store owner is the worst thing in the movie, except for that one very interesting and stirring scene, it does not diminish the films impact. The movie is interesting without being too terribly violent. It works on more intensity than constant action. There is one truely intense scene with a character stuck in a car that is overturned and about to catch fire, and a cop has to save her. The whole scene is much better than it sounds, and is much more intense than I can do justice to. If you have any soul, any compassion for other people, and any view of good, no, great, movies, you have to see this. Yes there is alot of language. Yes there is nudity. Yes there is violence. But what ther is not is a manipulative story line. Even if you hate all three of those things, still see this movie. Even if you hate it, even if you know you'll hate it, you need to see this movie. Get up and see this movie. Now! Go! But if you are not yet convinced, know that after you see this movie you will, like the characters, be a little bit of a better, no, greater, person.

This movie was brilliant, breathtaking, and simply beautiful. Paul Haggis should be considered a master in the ranks of Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) and Clint Eastwood (Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby). Haggis actually wrote the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby which proved he had incredible talent at writing. But in his first stab at directing since 1993 (he was an unknown then) he showed us he knows how to paint a tragic picture of humanity and show us characters that have real issues.

The acting was incredible, especially from Sandra Bullock (whom I hope searches out more serious roles in the future - she was brilliant), Ryan Phillippe, Thandie Newton (Oscar-worthy performance), Terrance Howard, and suprisingly enough - Ludacris (yeah, the rapper). He gave a great performance in this film and I hope he continues his movie career.

This film focuses on the subject of racism, and is the best film to do so since American History X. It throws so many punches at so many ethnic groups and so many racial tensions in this country that it brings itself above being just an enjoyable (though painful) film, but it is an important film that we could all learn a lesson from.

As you probably noticed, I gave this film an A+, which is something I don't hand out lightly. The only thing that I could say negatively about this film is its extreme similarities to Magnolia (which ultimately is still a greater film than Crash only because of its bizarre yet poetic madness , which this film lacks). Both films center around coincidences and what brings people together, and both films have unusual things falling from the sky at the end of the film. However, it didn't feel like he was stealing. If anything I think Haggis was paying tribute to Magnolia, but he gave this film his own personal touch and gave a new and unique story that makes us all wish we understood the world a little better.

I recommend this film to everyone, I think mainstream audiences have the capacity to enjoy this film because of its mainstream feel. I will caution though, this film has some extremely disturbing scenes and some very harsh characters and plot points.",1116979200,2,2223,4.788511749347259
2360394,5,B000A3XY5A,"What happened? Hollywood is not supposed to make movies this good. Written and directed by Paul Haggis, who did the screenplay for MILLION DOLLAR BABY, CRASH is a richly layered and nuanced commentary on race in America. Almost no group gets left out, whites, blacks, Asians, latinos, Persians. Then we have characters from different strata of our society-- upper middle class whites: (Brendan Frazer is a well-off district attorney in LA who is interested in only one thing: staying in office; and working-class whites: Matt Dillon in an outstanding performance plays an LA racist cop whose father is old and poor, suffering from a chronic kidney infection and cannot change his HMO physician. The blacks are just as varied. Some characters are upper middle-class-- Terrence Howard is a TV producer-- to LA detectives (Don Cheadle) to black street types whose occupation is carjacking and robbery.

What makes this movies amazing and one you'll want to see again is that the director takes an unflinching look at racism in this country, all kinds of it; and nobody gets off scot-free. He makes it more than a cut and dried, black and white issue. There are no heroes here, and even racists sometimes can do something right. Asians discriminate against other Asians. A racist white woman's best friend turns out to be her Latino maid. A black man tells his mother he is sleeping with a white woman rather than say she is Mexican-- which she isn't really-- because it will offend his mother more. This movie goes a long way in supporting my theory that unfortunately many minorities discriminate against all other minorities.

I knew I was viewing a complex work of art when scenes that made me mildly uncomfortable brought uproarious laughter from the two men sitting behind me who were of a different race.

This is one of the best movies you'll see this year.",1116806400,5,1861,4.882911392405063
2360395,1,B000A3XY5A,"It is very telling that after a recent ""strictly for the rich and famous"" pre-release showing of ""Crash"" in New York City, the infamous black racist Al Sharpton said he loved ""Crash"" so much he'd already seen it 4 times (it had yet to be released).

Why might a racial arsonist like Al Sharpton - a man who is known best for having singlehandedly destroyed race relations for at least one generation of black and white New Yorkers - find so endearing about ""Crash""?

The film has been widely hailed by most in our cliche swallowing, politically correct media outlets as a 'bold film' that takes an 'unflinching look' at race relations. But a divisive (...) like Al Sharpton likes this film for a reason, and it sure as hell isn't because it instills in the viewer a sense of our shared humanity. He like it because it reaffirms his world view; that while minorities may not be perfect, at the end of the day it's really all whitey's fault.

It's rather curious that the film asks us to see the white Italian-American actress Jennifer Esposito as a half Puerto Rican, half Salvadoran 'person of color' who objects violently at being described as 'white' by her black lover, played by Don Cheadle. What is one to make of this curious casting of an Italian-American as a 'Latina' in a role that asks the audience - no demands the audience - see her as non-white?  Couldn't the filmmakers have found a 'real Hispanic' actress for the role? If the role calls for her character to object to being called white, why cast a white actress in the role? Or are the filmmakers trying to tell us that we should no longer regard people who look like Esposito - people of Mediterranean complexion - as 'white'? Didn't they call this 'Nordicism' when it was first advanced by the likes of Adolph Hitler? What is going on here?

It seems to me the makes of this film might want to consider some of their won racist attitudes before lecturing others. I'd say if Al Sharpton loves this film so much he can have it.",1116806400,9,1995,4.515235457063712
2360396,5,B000A3XY5A,"That is what I loved about this film, how all of the characters were intertwined and held some sort of connection to each other. I also liked the redemption of the characters that was achieved at the end. Though it was sometims over-preachy, for the most part it maintained a fine balance.

Standout performances by Thandie Newton as the molested passenger, the Hispanic father and his little girl, Don Cheadle and Ludacris.

This is a very intellectual film with lots of non-PC humor spread throughout. It succeeds on all fronts.

Also look for a special performance by Counselor Troi as the persian mom and always remember to blake in traffic.",1116547200,2,645,4.845454545454546
2360397,3,B000A3XY5A,"About sums it up.  Blacks are poor tippers and thieves. Whites are afraid blacks will rob them (fear fulfilled). White men take advantage of black women.  Someone who saves your life in the morning may kill you in the evening (or vice versa). Persians (since Persia no longer exists, perhaps they were Iranians?) don't bother to listen or pay attention, just talk over you, become insanely angry, and try to murder you. Hispanics come out looking good. Asians are money-hungry and will sell out their own race. Also mothers and fathers never appreciate the ""good"" children. Someone else gets credit for the thoughtful deeds performed for the unappreciative parent.

This is some very broad pigeon-holing but doesn't really go anywhere. Entertaining to watch, although a bit slow at times, well-acted, but not a masterpiece or anything.",1116460800,6,835,5.125
2360398,5,B000A3XY5A,"It is not easy to write about ""Crash"".  It is a difficult film to describe and, therefore, a difficult film to classify.  However, having said this, the film is great.

""Crash"" involves the intermingling of a series of seemingly unrelated events that, each in its own way, have consequences.  A black LA cop is having an affair with his Puerto Rican/Salvadoran partner but is also trying to piece together his brother's life.  The brother is climbing a slippery pole of card jacking and related crime.  Other members of the police force are dealing with crime and racial prejudice in their own way where success is sometimes difficult to measure.  Perhaps the best short description is that choices often entail consequences.  These consequences are often unexpected and often bad.

This film is highly recommended.  The plot is wonderful, the music is captivating and the characters are totally believable.  At no point is the complex plot erratic as it moves from sub plot to sub plot.  Scenes seem to flow in a languid and thoroughly engrossing manner.  Most of the characters are flawed but they each seem to understand that their behaviour has been questionable.  They each come to see the need to treat others as they would want to be treated.  Yet at no point is the film seeking to preach.  Rather, it is simply portraying a set of events without trying to press a message upon the viewer.

See this film!  It is a great example of how near mainstream American film making can still offer something great without having to slump to clich&eacute;.  Let there be more films of this type in the future.",1116115200,2,1607,4.778181818181818
2360399,5,B000A3XY5A,"Fresh from his success with the Academy Award-winning ""Million Dollar Baby,"" for which he wrote the screenplay, Paul Haggis directs this dark-hued independent feature, for which he also co-authored the screenplay with Bob Moresco. A district attorney and his wife are carjacked in Los Angeles by a pair of black men, one of whom is the brother of a L.A. police detective, setting off a complex chain of events. The intertwined stories involve married couples, pairs of lovers, partners, and other family units. Though the focus at first seems to be a bit too obviously on race relations, the larger theme that emerges is the lack of communication that can turn a minor misunderstanding into violent tragedy with stunning speed. The pessimism of this theme is relieved by unexpected rays of hope--a life is saved by the seemingly miraculous failure of a weapon; a police officer whose cruelty stems from his seething anger at life gets an unexpected chance at redemption; an affluent and lonely woman discovers that her plain, patient housekeeper is her best friend.

Haggis unfolds his potentially unwieldy tale with remarkable clarity--though the film is reminiscent of Altman's epics, Altman doesn't have this control of pacing--and though there are a few too many coincidences the points that are made are so convincing that one is willing, as in Dickens, to suspend disbelief for the sake of the emotional payoffs. That so many of these ring true must also be credited to the large and uniformly superb array of actors, many cast against type. Notable among them are past teen heartthrobs Matt Dillon and Ryan Philippe playing a pair of conflicted L.A. beat cops, and Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock (particularly noteworthy in her brief scenes) as the district attorney and his wife; but the whole is tied together by the understated style and great, sorrowing eyes of the superb Don Cheadle as the good half of the two brothers at the heart of this tale. Lastly, the film is notable for the ease with which it captures a dark, frequently hostile, yet ultimately all-embracing Los Angeles, which by the end has practically become another character. Despite its occasional heavy-handedness ""Crash"" delivers both to the mind and to the heart of the viewer.",1116028800,,2261,5.029333333333334
2360400,5,B000A3XY5A,"This is one of those movies that follows several stories in parallel, and does so more successfully - that is, in a way that kept my interest - than any similar film I've seen.

It's also one of those movies I'd even like to show my mother, who's over 80, except that she'd object to the one brief sex scene and one molestation scene and numerous bad words.  There's some violence, but the most objectionable thing to most people is a large amount of bad language, especially racial slurs.  But they're a major part of the point of the movie, so it wouldn't work without them.

Knowing that the movie deals with racial prejudice going in, the redneck that I am, I was expecting to be beat over the head with liberal messages.  On the contrary, I was caught up in the stories, and recommend the film for dramatic impact alone.  Furthermore, I took the ""message"" as a broad one about the injustice that can result from any pre-judgment of people and their intentions, regardless of race, a perfectly well-taken moral along the lines of ""innocent until proven guilty."" If there was anything more liberal than that, it was too subtle to bother a guy like me.

The performances were great and the directing, editing, and writing blend the stories skillfully to maintins suspense from beginning to end.  There are also some surprises - pleasant ones as well as the more poignant you might expect.  With the caveat of my second paragraph above, I whole-heartedly recommend this film to everyone. Probably the best movie I've seen so far this year (haven't seen the new Star Wars film yet).",1116028800,,1582,4.661870503597123
2360401,5,B000A3XY5A,"Take a few seemingly unrelated stories of people in Los Angeles getting through the drudgery of daily life with the crutch of racial stereotypes and unsettling domestic discourse, then intertwine them, and you have the basis for this brilliant, highly engrossing film.

The major acting roles are superb. I never noticed Ryan Phillipe before but he impressed me as a cop with a conscience. Matt Dillion was very convincing as a thuggish, lonely cop with home problems that have shaped his views on race relations. Then there is the Persian shop keeper, a stranger in a strange land, frightened, angry and numbed by the crime that has affected his family. There are several other known actors in this film, some of whom provide among their best performances, but the lesser known folks also shine. No one is made to seem one-dimensional and none of the scenes are wasted.

There was one riveting scene that almost brought tears to my eyes involving our Persian shopkeeper where he goes over the edge, desensitized by the vacuum of crime and his feeling like a victim, due to his own foolish prejudices.

Rapper Ludicriss plays one of the carjackers, but in his first scene, he and his partner (whose significance we learn later on in the film) are seemingly innocent, intelligent and harmless guys, out for a night outside their home area and feeling like victims in the white neighborhood. The film doesn't hestitate to play the race card, showing what many of us feel but are sometimes too ashamed to admit.

Crash, not to be confused with the David Cronenberg 1996 film of the same name, is one of the best films that I have seen this year. It's directed and co-written by Canadian Paul Haggis, writer of the Oscar juggernaut Million Dollar Baby. Great debut for this first-time director.",1115942400,,1790,4.82084690553746
2360422,5,B000A3XY5A,"Plain and simply, CRASH is the best film I've seen in a long, long time.  There's nothing fancy about it; no $50 million special effects, no plot twist at the end, just a very talented director guiding a very talented cast.

The premise of the movie is pretty simple:  most of us know virtually nothing about our neighbors.  Yet we take that little slip of information that we might know (or might think we know) and use it to paint broad strokes.  Racism?  Yes, but to call this a film about race isn't doing it justice.  It plays a significant role, but there's far more to it than just that.  ""Racism"" implies hate, and only the characters portrayed by Matt Dillon and Ludacris can really be said to embody that.  However, even they both gain a measure of redemption before the end of the film (and it's not as cheesy as I just made it sound).

Rather than hate each other, these people just don't UNDERSTAND one another.  Don Cheadle's and Jennifer Esposito's characters take ""loving thy neighber"" to its pinnacle but as their dialogue with one another shows, neither of them really knows the other.  Shaun Toub sets out to find Michael Pena for malicious reasons, but not because they dislike one another.  One of them just has two separate encounters and in a moment of confusion, he draws what seems to him to be a logical conclusion.

Earlier today (May 13th), M. Nichols gave CRASH a one star rating.  It's not my place to ever criticize someone's opinions; if you don't like something, you just don't like it.  But I do take somewhat of an issue with some of the reasons for the negative review.  First, the comparisions to the other movies are not justified because those movies were ABOUT the issues described.  CRASH is not, it just uses those same issues to say something bigger.  And that brings me to my second point, which I believe is something Paul Haggis did intentionally.  CRASH is not trying to preach, teach or sway anyone.  The film is merely a mirror being held up to society.  That is what is so important about the very last scene.  When someone literally crashes into Loretta Devine's car, you can see the entire cycle about to start over again.

Before I end, I'd be remiss if I didn't make further mention of the cast.  It's becoming more and more fashionable to make films with ensemble casts.  Sometimes it can work well, at other times it can be a failure (OCEAN'S TWELVE never happened. Understand?  NEVER. We will not speak of it again).  But this is truly a talented cast.  You expect nothing less than exceptional out of Don Cheadle, and Matt Dillon is right there with him in terms of expectations and payoff.  Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frasier and Ran Phillippe give wonderfully nuanced performances.  Jennifer Esposito, Terrance Howard, Thandie Newton, Michael Pena and Larenz Tate are all wonderful actors who deserve much more than what I have seen them in in the past.

And then there's Ludacris...I normally HATE seeing rappers (or singers or quasi-celebrities) in film roles because everyone knows they were cast for their names and the potential box-office bonanza that they may bring.  Far too often they are vastly overshadowed by the real actors they are working alongside, which just further underscores their own lack of talent (Sean Combs in MONSTER'S BALL anyone?).  However, Ludacris holds his own here.  Yes, he may be trying a little too hard but it works for his character.",1115942400,2,3429,4.715488215488215
2360423,5,B000A3XY5A,"Early on in ""Crash"", Don Cheadle's character makes an observation that people crash into each other just to feel something.  He is talking about a car accident, but the deeper meaning is that we crash into each other as individuals.  ""Crash"" is a chronicle of those instances.  The film weaves a number of different story lines featuring characters of different races, religions, and wealth together in unexpected ways.  You have the opportunity to make a first impression of every character, only to find out later that that impression was completely wrong.

A big name cast makes this a movie that many will see.  If the cast contained more lesser-known actors, it still would have been as good, but would probably disappear quickly.  First time director Paul Haggis provides the screenplay (he wrote the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" as well) to a finely crafted film that makes you think without being too preachy, a common downfall of movies with this subject matter.

The cast is excellent all around.  The script is great, providing serious drama as well as some genuine laughs, with revelations about the characters peppered throughout the film.  ""Crash"" is an excellent movie that shows how first impressions are not always correct.  I highly recommend this film.",1115942400,,1279,5.07177033492823

Graham intones: "" I think we miss that sense of touch so much, we crash into each other just to feel something.""
No sooner does he say this than Ria and the Korean woman begin to trade racial slurs. And so begins an hour-and-a-half of racial epithets, set against the background of a Los Angeles that pounds home, time and time again that we are a so-called melting pot and that this melting pot is being brewed with hate, racial distrust and basic disdain for our fellow man.
There is nothing wrong with anyone pointing out our social problems but ""Crash"" is a relentless cudgel with which Haggis bludgeons both his movie and us his audience: none of the 15+ characters have much on their mind except race and do not hesitate to spout off about the deficiencies of one another.
In one particularly nasty scene, racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) literally begs, after he had already insulted her on the phone by the way, an HMO worker (Loretta Devine) to approve some medical tests for his suffering father. She denies the claim because Ryan is a racist and tells him: ""If your father had come in here to plead his case, I might have approved this claim...but I will not approve it for you."" There is no gray or white in ""Crash,"" just black. For Haggis, if you are powerful, have money and are burdened with a light complexion...you are the enemy, a devil...an automatic racist.
All of the actors do a first-rate job: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Philippe are beyond reproach. But despite their performances, and some snazzy editing (thanks to ""Magnolia""), ""Crash"" is a major, unrelenting downer.",1115683200,6,1797,4.707936507936508
2360426,5,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis' ""CRASH"" is quite simply one of the best, most extraordinary films I have seen in the last ten years.  The Academy Award nominated screenwriter of ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"" shocks his audience once again.  In a story too complex to explain, and so beautifully detailed and realized to give away, all I can tell the novice who may read this is that if you wisely spend your money to see this film, you will not only come away having sat through an extremely entertaining story, but you will come away utterly moved, and you will be compelled to examine your own life that you lead day to day.

In any given place, at any given time, people who you may only lay eyes on for a few moments can and will have a lasting effect on your existence.  Our worlds, our minds literally ""CRASH"" into each other leaving us shaken, stunned and hopefully, enlightened.  This amazing work of Haggis' is simply lifted to a higher level thanks to the pitch perfect work of a cast any director would kill to work with.  In a sea of flawless performances, it is difficult to say who stands out the most.  Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillion and Thandie Newton give career defining performances delivering thoughtful speeches that will take your breath away.  The rest of the cast, which includes the always wonderful Don Cheadle, the stunning Jennifer Espisito, Brendan Fraser, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard, William Fichtner and Ryan Phillippe to name a few, are all absolutely heartbreaking.

I can't rave enough about this film.  It is a learning experience to say the least, and a haunting piece of work that will stay with you long after you leave the theater.  Please, do yourself the favor and take yourself to see this film.",1115510400,3,1710,4.68561872909699

2360428,5,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis pulls back the veil of hypocrisy in an effort to reveal that all species human, regardless of their class, status or skin hue possess varied levels of racism that almost always seem to find their way to the surface in times of crisis.

The movie pulls no punches, but I for one, though at times felt shaken up never felt beaten up. At times felt saddened, but never felt abandoned. If Haggis was preaching, it wasn't brimstone and hellfire, and it wasn't to the choir. It was more like a modern book of ""Revelations,"" and either you get it or you don't!

Painful, yes, but almost always poignant and often surprisingly funny, Haggis makes certain no one escapes his magnifying glass. At times the malevolence that spews from the lips of Sandra Bullock (The DAs wife) or Shaun Toub (The Persian shop owner) is brutal and exceedingly uncomfortable. But for Haggis it's like a detox program on the road to recovery.

The tapestry is woven with purpose and coincidence that may preach and pound but it never hems or haws or equivocates. It's the kind of film that tries to prove that an audience 'can handle the truth' (sorry Jack!).

L.A. is a cultural melting pot and serves perfectly as an authentic backdrop for the movie's message and tone. Here Haggis paints a cinematic mural of his City of Angels. A city of hate, hope and redemption.

In my opinion, ""Crash"" is never bleak, just refreshingly honest. It's funny, sad, poignant and finally, in its own way...healing.",1115424000,2,1481,4.702702702702703
2360429,5,B000A3XY5A,"In high school most people in the United States have been taught that America is no longer a melting pot where different ethnicities are assimilated into one homogenous mix, but a tossed salad where people keep their differences from their ethnic backgrounds.  The ethnic background includes aspects such as race, linguistics, religion, and culture.  This knowledge frequently drifts into some unused part of the brain, as it slowly moves into oblivion.  Nonetheless, the ethnic differences between people continue to exist in the United States, as people work and handle their personal matters on a daily basis.  Crash tells a story of people from all parts of the world, as African-Americans, Asians, Caucasians, Hispanics, and Middle Easterners move through life and occasionally bump into each other by accident, a crash if you will.

Through daily interaction people accidentally connect with each other where stereotypes and generalizations are made based on assumptions from the brief incidents, previous events, and hearsay.  This is often the result of simplified deduction, which could be colored by emotion and bias.  The skewed perception of people with different ethnicity could also stem from appearance, gender, and the socioeconomic status of the observer and the observed.  Paul Haggis directs several interesting characters from all walks of life such as police officers, criminals, locksmiths, storeowners, and TV directors.  Some are caring while others neglect those around them.  They have one thing in common with each other - no one is alike.

Instead of playing the card of racism in a black and white manner, Haggis cleverly intertwines all of the characters through a truly genuine approach.  The origin of intolerance is being dissected through the camera that depicts the characters' behavior while also displaying the source of the behavior.  Through the characters Haggis displays different emotions such as fear, anger, hatred, and love.  These different emotions are expressed in different manners, as interactions between the characters accidentally appear.  Some times the observed feelings are subtle, as when Jean (Sandra Bullock) in fear grabs Rick's (Brendan Fraser) arm while Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) walk by them, which is even mentioned by Anthony.  Another more overt example is when Farhad (Shaun Toub) speaks in Farsi to his daughter at a gun store in Persian, as the gun store manager throws out prejudicial comments toward Farhad.

Many of the scenes display racism, but the focus is on an incident before that triggered emotions such as rage, fear, and hatred.  These powerful emotions burn violently inside each person when being hostile, as the individual regresses into simplistic thinking using their stereotypes and generalizations as guides.  When each person regresses through anger someone always tends to get hurt either physically or emotionally.  In turn this anger breeds more anger much like Hydra, as when one head is cut off two new heads grow out.  The anger develops into fear of similar incidents which then is communicated to friends, media, or other channels of communication.  Sometimes people simply neglect to inform others of racist behavior in fear of repercussions.  Consequently, the fear brings about more negative generalizations that feed the hatred.  In the story the hatred is directed toward people due to their ethnicity, as race is the easiest thing to observe since it rests within the skin color of each person.

Crash has a storyline over a 24-hour period that begins at the end with a car accident at a crime scene where a young man has been shot.  Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and Graham (Don Cheadle) exit the car, as Ria commences a verbal battle with an Asian lady and Graham approaches the crime scene.  This opening is a little taste of what is to come, as several different characters bump into each other by accident.  Each time two characters cross paths for whatever reason a new story emerges while it also affects the next story, as if the person was following his or her fate.  These stories are far more complex than the stereotypes and the generalizations, but life is also very complex.  This complexity will remind the audience of what they learned in high school, as the information will reemerge from oblivion.

Viewers who have seen films by Robert Altman will definitely recognize the method of the storyline from brilliant films such as Nashville (1975),  Player (1992), and Short Cut (1993).  Crash also bares certain similarities with the spellbinding Magnolia (1999) and Grand Canyon (1991).  Despite these similarities Haggis develops a unique story about a very important issue through digging into the roots of the issue.  The terrific cast (Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Dashon Howard, Ludacris, Shaun Toub, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Tony Danza) enhances the visual experience by truly going deep into themselves while performing scenes with intense emotion.  One of the best scenes is when Matt Dillion's character, Officer Ryan, tries to help Christine (Thandie Newton) out of a car.  This scene will definitely strike a cord with all viewers, as both actors display their talent.  In the end, Crash connects with the audience in a manner that offers both cerebral participation and deep reflection of self in regard to an important issue and it should periodically be reflected upon to prevent history from repeating itself.",1115424000,435,5549,5.270762229806598
2360430,5,B000A3XY5A,"Horrible/beautiful. Bad/good. Complex, fearful, loving and hating. Everything at once. This movie tells you what you know: that individuals are complicated and that they are motivated by summating input from wildly diverse sources. Reactions are not necessarily logical, but are internally consistent. We know this, right? However, this movie drags it all up by the scruff of it's neck and shoves it in your face and forces you to look at it in all its raging glory. All actions have repercussions that ripple out in bad and good ways. All lives interact without touching. We are insular and terrified of each other and for good reason sometimes. I wouldn't call this an uplifting movie but I would say that is was ""life affirming"". It is not trite, it doesn't moralize, it has no specific ax to grind.

The movie itself is beautifully shot, the performances are excellent all across the board. I definitely do not want to scare anyone off with the ""multiple story lines"" description because it all weaves together so well. The writing is excellent and satisfying.

The overall story involves a night and a day in Los Angeles. There is an automobile accident involving multiple cars. The action unfurls and at first I thought the movie was going to be all about racism. Well, it's not. It is much deeper than that. The writer has used racism as an obvious hook to draw us into the much more complicated processes of these people's minds. We follow police work (Matt Dillon finally comes of age and excels), the DA's (Brendan Fraser) involvement with multiple processes including politics, crime, and his brittle and unhappy wife (Sandra Bullock), two young black men with chips on their shoulders, one of whom grows maybe a bit in the course of events and the other who is not given the chance. Into the mix comes an ex-gangbanger locksmith who protects his daughter, the only truly good ""angel"" figure in the whole mess, with a lie. Truly heartbreaking performances by Ryan Phillipe as a naive policeman and Beverly Todd as the police detective's (Don Cheadle) mother especially stand out.

If you are even thinking about seeing this movie, go do it. You need to. Excellent.",1115424000,11,2175,4.857142857142857
2360431,5,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Haggis brilliantly exposes the inner thoughts of many Americans to the light of day in this exceptional film. A dozen Angelinos and 24 hours serve as his instruments; the seedier side of urbia his canvass. The failed American idea of blending the world's cultures into one, is deftly replaced by Mr. Haggis with a blending of diverse ideas into one American.

The ""man against himself"" conflicts, wonderfully portrayed by Matt Dillon, Sandra Bulloch, Terrence Howard and Ryan Phillippe, are center stage and framed by the more traditional ""man against man"" challenges of characters expertly brought to life by Don Cheadle, Shaun Toub, Thandie Newton and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. Mr Toub's character (Farhad) is also the catalyst for the most heart-wrenching moments of the film.

If Mr. Haggis's ""day job"" wasn't writing (Crash, Million Dollar Baby, EZ Streets) I would urge him to give it up for directing. Pacing, performances and positioning of this caliber are normally the eyemarks of only the very best of the best.

Entering the theatre I expected, at best, an Altmanesque experience of quantity over quality. Leaving the theatre I felt shame for prejudging the movie by its inexperienced director and lack of ""stars.""

This is one Crash you don't want to miss.",1115424000,,1274,5.110576923076923

8074207,5,B000A3XY5A,"This movie is amaizing good and unusual for the modern day PC Hollywood.
Maybe, it is good because it is not PC and characters are complex, like they are in real life.

This movie is very dynamic with many surprisingly interconnected characters, but it is not confusing and it does not leave viewer with cliffhanger when it ends.",1526169600,,329,4.672413793103448
