7789818,5,0780023463,"Akira Kurosawa tackled cardinal problems in all his films: the struggle for survival of men, women and children in a country devastated by war, terrorized by a corrupt government, ravaged by bandits and by yakusa extortions or torn asunder by clan fights. But, he almost always put human dignity at the center of the debate; although, also for him, the nature of human beings and their motives remain questionable ('Rashomon') .

One of these cardinal questions is nuclear safety, the threat of the use of nuclear weapons in a new worldwide conflict (see also 'Dreams - Mount Fuji in red, The weeping demon' and 'Rhapsody in August'). This threat was still strongly felt in Japan long after the Second World War. For the Japanese, the 'anxiety about the bomb that we all share' is still very real.
In this film, the threat becomes an obsession for a Japanese entrepreneur. He invested already heavily in underground dwellings. But now, he wants to sell outright the family assets (his foundry) and immigrate to Brazil. With all means available he tries to convince and force all his family members to leave Japan with him. But, those members reject completely his proposal and introduce a complaint in a court specialized in family conflicts. They try to block the sale of the family fortune and ask the tribunal to declare the patriarch insane.

The film plays on three levels: the individual and his anxiety, the family (and, of course, the inheritance) and the Japanese society in general through the court of justice. At the end of the film, one of the judges raises the crucial question: 'Are those who remain unperturbed by the threat of a nuclear war, not the real fools? '
The film exposes the harsh confrontation between the cynical and ungrateful family members and a 'sick' father. Only one family member (born out of wedlock!) continues to respect the patriarch.

With a wonderful Toshiro Mifune in the role of the family don, this movie is a must see, and most certainly by all Akira Kurosawa fans.",1382227200,,2011,4.840116279069767
7789819,5,0780023463,"Chronicle of an alive being explores the dramatis personae and brutal generational clash among the father of family and the rest of his family, when, product of the horrid shock of the Atomic bomb and the induced radiations, induce him to migrate to Brazil, although the rest of his family does not agree with him.

Victor Hugo affirmed the genius was always excessive and part of the genius of Akira Kurosawa must be seen under thus perspective.

A mature film loaded of dramatic intensity.",1194134400,,491,4.833333333333333
7789820,5,0780023463,"Forget ""Ran"" Kurowsawa did ""King Lear"" far better with a post-war Japan setting and adding the fear of nuclear testing into the story of a family business. Toshiro Mifuna was 35 when he played a 63-year old man fighting for his dignity against a family trying to have him declared incompetent. His perfomance is flawless. I grew up in a family business. I saw this film at 20 and then again at 42 and it unnerved me both times. Watch closely as the daughter-in-law moves from the margins to the center with her outrage at the old man's treatment by the family. I kid you not, this was one of Kurosawa's best.",1166659200,2,608,4.4375
7789821,4,0780023463,"This film, originally ""Record of a Living Being"", is not among Kurosawa's greatest (Rashomon, Seven Samurai, etc.), which is just fine considering the achievements he has brought forth during his career.  However, this film is good in its own way.  First, Toshiro Mifune's role is different, as he plays a much older, family man, and plays it very well.  Also, the entire film is good to sit through and is not dull.  Plus, there is a clear message in the film about people who ""live in fear"" (although it is reiterated a bit too often).  However, the best part of this film -- and perhaps the biggest reason to buy this movie -- is the ending.  Here, Mifune's character gives one of his trademark, astonishing performances and mesmerizes, sort of similar to the way he did in ""Rashomon"".  However, see the whole movie first before you fast-forward to the ending in the future.",1000771200,2,877,4.69281045751634
7789822,4,0780023463,"This 1955 release is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of his bigger films like ""Rashomon"" and ""Seven Samurai"" but it's still worth seeing. The great Toshiro Mifune plays an industrialist in post-World War II Japan who is slowly going mad with the notion that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family (and his mistresses) to flee Japan with him. Mifune's obsessive portrayal is the stuff of great tragedy especially as he vainly pleads with his greedy family to leave and Takashi Shimura, the samurai leader in ""Seven Samurai"", is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten the mess out.  The movie captures Japanese dread about the atom bomb, a subject Kurosawa would also treat in his masterpiece, ""Ikiru"", very well and with the greedy family closing in on a raving patriarch, brings to mind ""King Lear"", a tale the director would go back to many years later in ""Ran"". This is a small film from one of the world's great directors but a very good one.",971740800,6,1021,4.6722222222222225
