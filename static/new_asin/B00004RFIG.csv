7921164,5,B00004RFIG,"SPANISH SUBTITLES?  A good purchase if you want to learn phrases like ""you sexy little witch.""  If you are new to the series the LIMC doesn't recommend this film as your first viewing.  However, if you are familiar with these films then you can expect a standard Witchcraft film.

7921165,2,B00004RFIG,"Kathleen St. Lawrence saves this film from being a total bomb.  She is a knock-out...the rest of the film does of a good job of knocking itself OUT!  It starts with a wake-up call where boyfriend/girlfriend make love in the early morn...he is well groomed and clean-shaven...she's got immaculate make-up...DUH!  It's real turn-off...she's fat and ugly, too.  It ends with three chicks eating a guy alive out in the woods.  Inbetween there's plenty of sim sex.  I think Kathleen takes her top off 57 times...but the excitement ends there.  Some of the best lines from the film are:  ""If I ever wake up from this dream, will you please push the snooze button?""  HONEST!  That is in the script. Near the end of the film, right before the guy gets gobbled up limb by limb, the fat chick from the opening scene asks her boyfriend, ""Where are they?""  He gives her a quick glance and says...""Where are we?""  That sums it up.  Push the snooze button and wake up from your nightmare!  I must say, it's much better than Witchcraft X...I gave it a 1...this one a 2.",1024012800,5,1054,4.537234042553192
7921166,1,B00004RFIG,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen.  I unfortunately bought this movie in an attempt to find a good Horror flick.  This film offers some of the worst acting ever, and an extremely poor plot.  This movie should not receive any stars at all but unfortunately I have to give it at least one.",975628800,3,310,4.220338983050848
