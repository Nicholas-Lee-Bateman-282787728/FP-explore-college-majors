5077648,5,B007CK6C1M,"This ""review"" is of Opeth's ""Lamentations Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003 Special Edition"" released in April of 2012 on The End Records/Sony Music/Music For Nations.

It is difficult to get information online regarding exactly what this set includes - even the Amazon description above is not particularly helpful. To clarify, this ""special edition"" contains:

Three (3) discs: two (2) compact discs and one (1) region-free DVD, all in a regular-sized hardshell, solid-side DVD case.

Outer labeling art is identical to original U.S. DVD soft (paperboard) case release with small text boxes added to front and back and text on the spine to denote the ""Special Edition"" status. Publishing information is, obviously, changed to reflect current publishers.

Inner DVD booklet/liner notes are identical to original U.S. DVD soft case release booklet/liner notes with same updates to publishing information.

Compact discs are identical to the compact discs previously only available in the ""Collector's Edition Slipcase""; however, no part of the original compact disc packaging art, booklet or notes is included - not even a breakdown of which songs appear on which discs.

Art/labels on all discs are identical to orginal U.S. release version art/labelling, again with updates to publishing information.

Content of all discs is identical in format and quality to previous release versions. Widely reported ""buzzing"" or feedback on at least some orginal release compact discs is not present on (at least my copies of) these pressings.

Contents of each disc are as follows:

Compact Disc 1:
1. Windowpane
2. In My Time of Need
3. Death Whispered A Lullabye
4. Closure

6. To Rid The Disease

Hope this clarifies just what this package is all about.

As for an actual review...it's classic Opeth. Of course it's great - even when Mikael's vocals go a bit flat (let's be honest!) or sharp, the music is always brilliant. Budget-wise, if you want an audio-only hard copy of this concert, this set is far more affordable than the ""Collector's Edition Slipcase"" has become on the secondary market. Finally, if you are reading this ""review,"" you probably have a some idea what the band is all about. Buy this set.",1349308800,24,2818,5.093478260869565

8514553,5,B007CK6C1M,"Really enjoyed this video. At the time I purchased this, I had only heard Damnation and Heritage which is Opeth's more Prog Rock style. It was interesting to see where the band had come from with the growling vocals and then changing over to clean vocals. I also loved the behind the scenes documentary on the making of both of these albums.",1505520000,,341,4.516129032258065

The bonus CDs of live material covering the entire show is awesome to add to my Opeth collection. One of my all-time favorite metal bands, these guys have so much talent it is ridiculous.",1420502400,,315,4.642857142857143

8514561,5,B007CK6C1M,"With buying the OPETH live-recording releases you pretty much have THE VERY BEST the band has to offer right now.

As much as I love their studio-albums I clearly recommend Lamentations or The Roundhouse Tapes first at all times.
Not in particular for the audience addition but more so for the crystal clear performance registration which I think marks the difference.
Next to that OPETH live feature their best songs, probably lacking one or two..but what else is new!

On Lamentations you can enjoy the OPETH's Damnation album and a 2nd disc with heavier songs.
Must-buy release for the fans!",1377993600,,594,4.93
