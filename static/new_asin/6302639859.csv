7829602,5,6302639859,I love most of the Bosses work including his collabaration with Gary US Bonds albums released a few years back (how about re-releasing some of them ) but his Human Touch/Lucky Town in my opinion are two of his best works. This video contains a lot of the songs in these two albums and is performed and sung as only the Boss can. This video is in my top 5 favorite shows and can only be bettered by making a good transfer to DVD (SOON PLEASE).,1073520000,,442,4.151162790697675
7829603,3,6302639859,"A good concert, but lacking in enthusiasm.  It seems The Boss has lost his spark singing his classics from way back.  I loved the Boss way more in the early days, and can't seem to get into the whole Human Touch / Lucky Town  experience.  Call me crazy, but I still love to hear 4th of July, Asbury  Park, Backstreets, and Thunder Road.  Thunder Road is included on this  video, but it seems Bruce wished he didn't have to sing it.  You can't  blame him really.  I'd be sick of it too, if I had to sing it every time I  picked up a guitar.  Red Headed Woman, Man's Job, and Atlantic City stand  out, and the Boss puts on a nice performance, but I wish I could have seen  him 15 years ago.  I just missed out on the greatest rock'n'roll experience  you could have.",959212800,,763,4.123287671232877
7829604,4,6302639859,"There is no doubting Mr Springsteen is one of the finest live perfomers in this era of recorded music. Therefore I was a little upset when he plugged in the guitar on this perfomance, although how can you stay mad at 'The  Man'. He proved his classics have lost none of their lustre, and finally I  have a rendition of Light of Day in my musical arsenal!
Keep on Bruce,  don't stop the music!",957484800,2,392,4.27027027027027
7829605,4,6302639859,"Having seen Bruce in concert with and without the E-Street Band, this tape is the cloest available video media to the type of non-E-Street concerts he's been performing over the past few years.  Great rendition of ""Red  Headed Woman"".",917308800,5,234,4.9743589743589745
