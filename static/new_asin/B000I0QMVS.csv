At the end of the nineteenth century the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company designed and built the world's finest yachts.  This is the story of the company, and more specifically of the two brothers who founded and ran it.  There are lots of good photos of historic yachts, the brothers and the factory where it all happened.  The narrative is very well done.  Interviews with historians and contemporary yacht builders round things out.  For anyone interested in yachting's golden age, this is a godsend.  The length is just under an hour and the production is good.  I have the vhs tape and have watched it many times, but have not seen the dvd, so can't say whether there are any extras.  My only complaint is that there is so much more that could have been said, especially about the steam boats and their revolutionary engines.  I give this film a very high recommendation to sailors, builders, designers, historians or anyone in love with a world that no longer exists and in need of inspiration and confirmation that there were people who devoted their all to setting a standard that may never be surpassed.  Enjoy!",1216425600,2,1161,4.788944723618091
