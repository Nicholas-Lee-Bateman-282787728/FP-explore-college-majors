It started as 4:3 letter boxed wide screen with back on all 4 sides. The switched to 4:3 (full for old TV) with bars on left and right. It is listed as the 2008 version which I was told was fixed.
I had already seen the movie on TV but wanted to see it again. I watched 10 minutes and the repacked it up and sent it back.",1395446400,,449,3.9450549450549453
