The Main thing I got out of this video was finding out how many paranormal groups actually are in competition with each and try to take other group's idea's.  I can totally relate to this as when I formed my own Group in Florida...there who were out to take my Groups Ideas and basically give us absolutely no credit.  I was very free and trusting with information...only to find other groups not so open and actually claiming Haunted Hunters Ideas for their own. I have even had members come into the group with the intentions of taking our ideas and investigation methods. This video shows this to be true over most of the country.  Unfortunately with so many immature people in the field...the scientific community will never take most of us serious.  Television has done one great thing for paranormal groups and one terrible thing.  The great thing is more awareness across the country of what paranormal investigators actually do.  The terrible thing is that now people who are actually Ghost tourists and simple thrill seekers..now call themselves investigators.  These people either join groups or form groups thinking sleeping in a cemetery or simply taking picture of orb or listening to the wind...is an actual investigation. I even had these thrill seekers infiltrate my own group..only later to find they were never serious. Also some people join groups as agitators..not investigators. Instead of coming up with their own ideas they simply float around or spy on other groups. This video highlights this problem and lack of cooperation.
The paranormal community needs to straighten up it's act and remove themselves from these type of groups. In Tampa I see groups going cemeteries with Psychics...using dowsing Rods...capturing animal sounds as EVP's..and calling themselves scientific. In this video you will a couple of good groups that seem to want to do the right thing and eliminate this problem.  Hopefully this will all come about. Overall not such a well done video..but some good education into the problems that plague the scientific groups along with Haunted Hunters PSI. Hopefully the idea of a database will come about.",1203033600,,2298,5.026315789473684
8216264,2,B000QEKIGQ,"This DVD is okay. It's certainly not the worst out there. Unfortunately, like alot of recent films like this, it's mostly a self promotion piece for various ""professional"" people in the ghost hunting world.

But even more so, the buyer needs to understand that both the editorial review and the 5 star review are from people associated with the project.

If you are looking for an unbiased opinion on whether or not to purchase this you need to do more research. My personal opinion, and the reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 3 is that, if it were truly worth your money, it wouldn't need the people involved giving it a false boost.",1185753600,2,636,4.521739130434782
8216265,5,B000QEKIGQ,"This is a very in depth look into the paranormal community and culture as it stands today.  This documentary features a wide range of people within the paranormal community as they answer some very interesting questions on theory, investigations and the paranormal community as a whole.

This is a must have for any paranormal enthusist, ghost hunter, parapsychologist or just the advid show watcher.",1179446400,2,400,5.234375
