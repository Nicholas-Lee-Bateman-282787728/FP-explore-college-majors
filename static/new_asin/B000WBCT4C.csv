2963957,5,B000WBCT4C,"Every section will give your body a good workout.  I like that they are short, yet effective. When your body gets comfortable, you can even double up on your workouts and do 2 of the same section in a row.  I really enjoy this Workout DVD and I happy with my purchase.",1267574400,,268,4.134615384615385
2963958,5,B000WBCT4C,"This is a very nice set of five separate routines which can be combined into a tough strength/toning workout, or used separately as quick 10-minute routines whenever you get the chance during the day. Debbie Siebers leads you through the Buns and Thighs routines, which involve a lot of squats, kicks, and mat-work that will definitely leave your legs burning - and elevate your heartrate moderately as well. Tony Horton leads the Abs, Arms, and Stretch routines. Ideally you should do the Stretch both before and after completing the other routines.

I definitely found the workout challenging, especially the Abs section, but was pleased how in time I found I was able to improve my stamina and strength. All moves are simple to learn and no additional equipment is required, although you can choose to do the Arms routine with weights. A workout such as this one should definitely be complemented by walking or other cardio routines if your goal is weight loss (or weight management). But for toning, it covers different ""troublezones"" of the body really well and is a program I would recommend.",1262563200,5,1098,4.935135135135135
2963959,5,B000WBCT4C,"I LOVE these workouts!  They are low-impact, quick, but REALLY WORK!  I used the VHS version of them a few years ago to take off 90lbs.  Since then, I've gained some weight, so I've now purchased these in DVD to help me get back to where I want to be.  I just did the arms and thighs yesterday and really feel it in my muscles today.  So easy for beginners for sure - with results.",1247097600,9,381,4.026666666666666

8222080,5,B000WBCT4C,A wonderful workout video to compliment any workout routine even if you have a gym membership,1435536000,,93,4.875
8222081,5,B000WBCT4C,"Think of it in terms of quality over quantity. There are plenty of long workouts available but many people, including me, like to get a shorter workout and target specific areas. This video fulfills that need.
There are five workouts:
Great Abs - which is a simple but very effective abs routine, Tony Horton leads
Great Stretch - I love the way I feel after this, Tony Horton leads
Great Buns - sounds silly but I doubt many people won't have buns that burn after this, Debbie Siebers leads
Thin Thighs - my personal favorite, it is a terrific program, Debbie Siebers leads
Great Arms - the only one I don't use but it's here for those who want it, Tony Horton leads

I do Great Buns on Monday and Thursday.
I do Thin Thighs on Tuesday and Friday.
I do Great Abs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
I do Great Stretch whenever I feel like it.",1404172800,3,840,4.350318471337579
8222082,5,B000WBCT4C,Used once a day doesn't amke you a rock star but keeps you from visiting the cardiologist. How is that fo a review,1401408000,2,114,4.0
8222083,5,B000WBCT4C,"This video is set up in segments - stretch, thighs, abs, arms and buns. All are about 10 minutes each, so if you want to work on a particular area, it's easy to do, and if you want to rotate shorter workouts for different areas each day, it can be done. I thought the arms would include push ups but they don't - surprisingly. Just isometrics or light weights.",1372204800,2,360,4.231884057971015
8222084,5,B000WBCT4C,"I have probably purchased 5+ copies of this over the years just because I eventually wear them out!  I like how these are no nonsense, simple, yet effective.  Once you get the form down, you can mute it and listen to your own music and the time flies by.  Great for travel.  Great for body ""troubleshooting.""  I am considering buying a lifetime supply incase these ever go entirely out of stock!",1367712000,,395,4.507042253521127
8222085,5,B000WBCT4C,This is a great overall workout!  Recommend this to anyone who wants to shape and tone up!  Tony (and Debbie) are great trainers.,1360195200,,129,4.565217391304348

8222087,5,B000WBCT4C,"i've been using this workout since before i was married...11 years ago back when it was only on VHS. Now, that my tapes are now just showing static i was glad to see this on a DVD! Yeah!!! Don't let the few minutes it takes to workout fool you. You will feel it in every area of your body.",1315958400,,289,3.9152542372881354
8222088,5,B000WBCT4C,"I have always loved these workouts.  I owned them in VHS and pretty much wore them out.  The workouts are short, yet effective.  Great for those who can't seem to fit in a 45-60 minute workout.  Do one or two a day and you'll be in shape in no time.",1313798400,,249,3.92
8222089,5,B000WBCT4C,"I use to have this on VHS and was thrilled when I found all workouts on 1 CD.
These are great for beginners wanting to slim down and tone up without muscle bulk.
I love beach body work outs. They really know what they're doing!",1304121600,,227,4.066666666666666
