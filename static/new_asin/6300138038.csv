7802920,4,6300138038,"This is ""The House of Shokoti,"" parts 1 and 2.  This is the only two-part He-Man story in the entire series.  And these episodes are some of the best they ever made.
A new and much more formidable villainess is the mainspring to the action here.  Leaving aside Skeletor and his never-ending quest to wrest away the power of Grayskull, these episodes are centered around the mysterious tomb of Shokoti, an ancient sorceress whose shade wishes to spread darkness across Eternia from the desert sands where she slept.
Shokoti was a memorable character who gave He-Man a much better fight than he usually got.  By the second episode, she has He-Man bound to a slab with magical bonds, and threatens to sacrifice him to the sinister Sleeping Beast.  The Beast, also, is one of the most memorable monsters to appear in a He-Man episode.  This tale delivers He-Man excitement more vivid than the series usually offered.
He-Man, of course, was one of the first entries in the 1980's renaissance of action cartoons.  The much criticised fact that the shows were part of the marketing efforts of a toy company meant, ultimately, that the sponsor was willing to spend some money on production values.  The only trace of 1970's sententiousness and handwringing left in He-Man was the intrusive end-of-episode sermon.  This one features Ram-Man's ""moral"" cautioning you not to hit things with your head.  One suspects there was a bit of a nudge-nudge wink-wink factor in this sermonette.
I understand that some of the He-Man videos will be re-released when a new series of He-Man action figures hits the shelves.  I hope House of Shokoti is one of the ones they reissue.",1004486400,,1657,4.8612099644128115
