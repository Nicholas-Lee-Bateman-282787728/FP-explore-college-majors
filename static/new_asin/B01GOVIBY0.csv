8763220,3,B01GOVIBY0,"I wanted to comment on the outrageous price for the Steelbox edition, which is roughly $30 more than the regular Blu_ray. For that you get some extras, a magnet (Whoopee) and Dolby Atmos. Simply ridiculous.

I also want to critisize Amazon for not indicating which of the myriad editions they sell have Dolby Atmos.

I have not watched this set yet",1468972800,3,348,4.688524590163935
