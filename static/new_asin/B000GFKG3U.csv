8131320,3,B000GFKG3U,I love Greg and Steve but this video did not get the kids motivated.  I put it in and they watched for a few minutes and left the room.,1303603200,,135,3.6551724137931036
8131321,5,B000GFKG3U,I bought this dvd for my 3 year old daughter and 1 year old son. They absolutely love it. They dance to it and already know most of the songs. It was a great choice!,1296777600,,165,3.742857142857143
8131322,5,B000GFKG3U,"The kids in my home daycare absolutely love this video. They jump up as soon as we put the dvd on, and dance, shout and sing throughout. I just reviewed the Wiggles 'You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" dvd...such a boring one. I was hoping for real enthusiasm from the kids, and they sat, glassy-eyed, and lost interest early on. If you want your kids excited, go with Greg & Steve!",1288310400,3,377,4.323943661971831
