8665771,5,B00LGY45SM,"I was somewhat disappointed in the film's length, but then one must learn, as I did, to read all the info concerning it. I thought it was a full length feature but instead it turned out to be a 26-minute short.. There was no scripted dialogue; just a hip hop boy spending some time with his friend--swimming, telling jokes, fooling around on the beach, etc. I did admire his dancing skills thus the phrase ""hip hop"" and my rating. But because of its shortness, it would have been nice if they also ""shorten"" the price. But still, in spite of all this, it was an OK film.",1452902400,,570,4.336448598130841
8665772,5,B00LGY45SM,"As previously stated is a short film made as a project, some complained about length of film..was stated was 27 mins long..seem those who gave not so nice review should go take a nice pill.

Jest of the film is, 2 friends get together and swim and have good time, one asked other if he was still dancing and stated yes still hip hop danced, those who complain about the dancing according to his mother this was made in late 90's and hip hop was just a bit different from way they hip hop dance now..we bought to see a bit of so calif ..and way kids danced back then",1389657600,,565,4.136363636363637
8665773,5,B00LGY45SM,"I really don't know where or how to begin this comment.  But, I'm sorry that everyone who has purchased this DVD so far, has been really disappointed.  In all honesty, I can't even believe I found this DVD on Amazon!  (thank you Amazon and ""Fun Studios"" whoever you are!)

Here is the dealio...I am so glad I found this on Amazon. Why?  Because the main character in this short film, Ryan Ellis, is my son!  He did this film when he was 11 years old.  He will be 25 years old this year, 2012.  This film was meant to be an original, personal project for the director (name withheld).  The whole entire storyline was created by an amateur film maker (at the time) and it originally came out on VHS tape.  My son had lent the only copy I had (on VHS) to a friend of his and she never returned it because she lost it.  That film was a sweet souvenir of mine because even though it wasn't a very good production or storyline, it was special to me because I was there on location while the entire film was shot. And, it was just a sweet memory of a time when my son was a young boy who loved to dance. I don't know who ""Fun Studios"" is, I do know the director/man who wrote the story and filmed it was just a very nice human being.  He saw my son dance in a hip hop troupe at a fitness convention and approached me and asked if he could use my son as the main character for his small video project.  That is how it all started.  I honestly don't think this short film was ever meant to hit the ""top of the charts"" or anything like that.  I know the storyline leaves much to desire, too. I don't know how it got on Amazon, but I'm glad it did, because after all these years of ""mourning"" (haha) the loss of the original VHS tape, I was able to find and buy the DVD here on Amazon!
Sincerely,
Ryan Ellis' (aka Hip Hop Boy) mom :)",1338595200,8,1822,4.050279329608938
8665774,1,B00LGY45SM,"I've seen better-quality movies sold for far less. I thought maybe I could rebuttle the two reviewers here but they're right:  nothing extraordinary about this film AT ALL!  Just a couple of adolescents getting together and talking and playing, nothing more, nothing less.  And when they share jokes, the jokes are nothing at all of a ""HA HA"" nature.  Plus, as another reviewer points out, the boy's dancing talent is raw and sloppy.
But what's more:  the film begins with a very bad lesson for children:  the protagonist, as he narrates, complains about school, doing homework and how he finds certain subjects boring.  His friend calls him by cell and, VOILA!, he's out the door on his bike to meet him.  Is this the attitude and mentality we are to convey to the next generation that's blooming?
I spared no time in returning this film.....the very next day!  There's nothing so extraordinarily ""hip hop"" about this film; ""Happy Days"" it is not.",1293926400,3,948,4.802469135802469
8665775,1,B00LGY45SM,"I purchased this dvd for a friend.  She stated that she watched it for 10 mins. and turned it off.  She returned it to me. I watched it for 10 mins. and then fast forwarded through the rest of the movie.  In summation, boy rides bike home from school, boy meets friend at pool, boy swims in his boxer shorts, boys talk, boys go to beach.  This is a rank amature film that is little more than a home movie.  Amazon should be ashamed of itself for placing this movie on its ""recommended"" list.  Don't waste your time or money on this movie.",1292630400,5,538,4.174757281553398
8665776,2,B00LGY45SM,"Purchased this to see some dance moves. Incredibly disappointed. This kid's talent is VERY raw, and the moves are really sloppy. The storyline ain't that great, either.
Two kids are close friends. They hang out at one's pool. Our star has no bathing suit, so he swims without one. Then the two share 'funny' stories and jokes before the dancing begins.
If he wants a career in dance, I hope he isn't relying on this film to pad his resume.
Sheesh.",1258416000,9,447,4.530864197530864
