It is only one camera angle so we reached out to someone at SubPop and they said that wasn't right and that there are apparently some bad pressings out there. They then put us in touch with someone from K7 and they confirmed. They sent us a file with the correct show, multiple camera angles, it's great but I do wish I had a professionally pressed DVD of that was right.",1385769600,,452,4.1477272727272725
8532377,5,B008Y1YHDI,I chose this rating because mudhoney rule! It is a sure must for any mudhoney fan! It features great songs!,1379808000,,107,4.4
8532378,4,B008Y1YHDI,"with more than 1 report that this release IS viewable as a multi-cam mix, perhaps some were mis-pressed with only that angle at the back of the room.  ive also seen this footage as a multi cam on youtube/'im now' doc, etc.  has someone emailed the label that put it out?",1358553600,,270,4.2745098039215685
8532379,5,B008Y1YHDI,"For $10 this is a really good live show.  I liked the full setlist and the bonus interview with Mark Arm.  The band played well, using instruments to play.  Each member moved around, stood still then moved around more.  Just to let you know, I'm not really in the mood to continue writing because I am currently half asleep.  Just buy this, don't take my word for it.  If you like Mudhoney, you will like Live in Berlin.",1358121600,,420,4.32051282051282
8532380,1,B008Y1YHDI,"This is basically a nice quality bootleg.
One camera, back of the room, clear and unobstructed view of stage.

The credits list 5 camera ops, but you only see the work of the
one at the back of the room, heck you even see camera men on stage,
but not what they are shooting.

A trailer on youtube shows edited segments with multiple angles
but the dvd I ordered two days ago has only one unedited angle
from a tripod at the back of the room.

The disc contains pal format and ntsc format, both with the
same single camera footage.

Sound is similar to the trailer, a bit thin and crispy.

Misleading youtube trailer found here:

8532381,3,B008Y1YHDI,"It's nice having some early Mudhoney footage, but be warned: This is shot from a single camera in the back of the venue so most of the shots are just Mark Arm singing. There are no other cameras.

Audio quality is fine. It's entertaining enough, but I was at least expecting a professionally shot concert. This is basically a bootleg.

Edit: Another reviewer claimed I didn't watch the video. I don't think THAT reviewer watched the video. One camera zooming in doesn't make it a multi-cam shoot. I rewatched it to make sure, and there's just one camera. Again, with that said, it's Mudhoney, and they rock and deserve your money! I am hoping for other DVDs from the band as well, I just thought this would be better.",1353110400,3,717,4.550387596899225
