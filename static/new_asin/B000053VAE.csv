1390631,2,B000053VAE,"This is a benchmark for how NOT to record sound tracks.
You buy Charlotte's recordings to hear her truely amazing voice and you have such high hopes that her voice will be recorded in a way that shows some respect for her incredible talent.
Then you play her latest DVD and your heart sinks.
Charlotte's previous Voice of An Angel DVD (not the CD) is recorded so well that you can't turn it off. On the other hand, this DVD's voice track is recorded so poorly that it just makes you sick. I'll put mine in the stack of stuff to trade.
Her singing sounds as if she's in an other room. Her speaking voice during the narrations however, sounds crystal clear so you know that the recording technicians are robbing you of the chance to hear this truely great singing talent. These ""alleged"" technicians should find something else to do becides making DVDs.
So Sad.",976752000,6,859,4.512820512820513
1390632,5,B000053VAE,"""Charlotte Church in the Holy Land""  is so beautiful that it almost defies description.  Every track on this DVD, from the very child like ""When a Child is Born"" to the almost overwhelming power she brings to ""O Holy Night"" is a world class performance.  The setting of this concert - the Dormiton abbey- the resting place of the virgin Mary- is breathtaking, and seems to lend a quality to Charlotte's voice which is unmatched, even on her Christmas CD release.
Charlotte is beautiful, and preternaturally gifted. But this performance is more than just that.  She imparts a devotional quality to this material that is obviously unforced. Yet, this is only fitting - she has already brought comfort and joy to millions of people.",975369600,53,729,4.854838709677419
1390643,4,B000053VAE,"I enjoyed Charlotte Church in the Holy Land very much, although I really can't tell if Charlotte lipsynched or not.  Every song sounds exactly as it did on the CD -- in all of her other concerts, Charlotte sang some of the songs a bit differently than she did for the CD.  The most noteworthy is Silent Night, when her voice on the second track is heard along with her actual singing.  If she did lipsynch, it really can't be held against her.  She had just finished recording the CD, not to mention that she had given a full concert (Charlotte Church in Jerusalem) on the same evening as she recorded Charlotte Church in the Holy Land.  She was only fourteen years old at the time, and her voice might not have been able to handle being so overworked.

The performance itself was nice --if she did sing then and there, her voice was strong and beautiful, although, slightly flawed (her technique was not perfect, and her jaw did begin to wobble quite a bit toward the end.)  Although, since she was still a child at the time, that was not her fault, that was the result of an incompetent voice teacher.  All that aside, she was still impressive.

I enjoyed the documentary bits very much (that is the history buff in me!)  I enjoyed her talks with historians who gave interesting facts about life in the first century, and told us about things that many people don't realize about the Nativity Story.  My favourite part was when she was dressed as Mary, and inside the replica of the sort home that Mary most likely would have lived in.  I wish there had been more bits like that!",1214179200,2,1581,4.451388888888889
1390644,5,B000053VAE,"Charlotte Church In the Holy Land is the ultimate Christmas DVD! I am 24 and have always loved Miss Church's voice (I wish she would have stayed classical, though..) but nevertheless I still listen to her old CDs all the time. It has been five years since the release of this DVD and I am still pulling it out every Christmas to watch. I think it is timeless, her voice is magnificent and I think anyone would enjoy it.",1135123200,4,419,4.3164556962025316
1390645,5,B000053VAE,"I have read, with interest, the opinions of the other reviewers, and I agree that the product promotion at the beginning of this otherwise wonderful and upliftng product is annoying and in very bad taste. Nevertheless, At a time when general appreciation for the meaning of Chistmas is is sorrowfully short supply, I welcome the opportunity to give this DVD to my friends and family, in hopes that Charlotte's gift will give us all a better appreciation for, and motivation to emmulate, the life and example of Jesus Christ. It is an excellent addition to any DVD collection.",1038441600,8,575,4.877551020408164
1390646,5,B000053VAE,This is a wonderful production especially for those who always wished they could go to the Holy Land. The Christmas hymns really captivates the essence of Christmas and to be able to see Charlotte Church kneel down to kiss the spot where Jesus was born is itself truly touching. A beautiful and humble girl with God given talents that can move the heart.,1020643200,17,354,4.634920634920635
1390647,1,B000053VAE,"I have always wanted to visit the Holy Lands.  However, if I do, this Video is a reminder not to take Miss Church along.  She provides no more than sterile renditions of religious favorites, while going from place to place with her as the focal point of attention.  I would have been much more pleased with her providing a narration of a video of these lands; while being out of sight and refraining from singing.  Her voice simply doesn't provide the warmth and emotion necessary to move an individual through such an experience.  This video may suffice for an elementary school crowd, but doesn't do it for me.",1012435200,63,612,4.62962962962963
1390648,5,B000053VAE,"First of all, to those who say that Charlotte's mouth quivers, her mouth hardly ever quivered in this concert. She didn't lip sync either. She also did very well with enunciating, which made her singing sound very great. A good listener can also easily tell that the performance is live and genuine because at one point I heard her voice echo in the church hall.  You can also tell both she and the orchestra and choir are putting lots of effort into their music.
 Besides, this concert DVD was a great pleasure to watch when I recieved it for Christmas. Charlotte sings ten songs from her Christmas album and two from her first album. It's a good chance for American fans who don't have the import to hear ""The First Noel"", which for some strange reason did not appear on the North American album. The setting of the concert is very beautiful, performed in a lovely Abbey and good camera direction presant fantastic shots of both Charlotte and the orchestra. In between songs, Charlotte takes a tour of the Holy Land, where she visits sites like the ancient church built over the birthplace of the Savior. The DVD has good special features such as a photo gallery and a very early performance of ""Silent Night"". The whole performance and presantation worked out very well. In fact, I like this concert even more than the Voice of An Angel concert(this concert has better camera angles and lighting). Whether you're a Charlotte fan and/or a faithful Christian, you'll like this very much because Charlotte fans get to see Charlotte perform and Christians get to learn about the holy places Charlotte visits while hearing performances of carols and sacred arias. I am very amazed by the spiritual touch of this concert DVD. Christmas may be over now, but it's probably not too late to check out this DVD.",1009324800,8,1803,4.720634920634921
1390649,5,B000053VAE,"I first saw this video on PBS and was absolutly spellbound by her voice and presense. She is an amazing natural talent.
I am a Christian and I love Christmas music.  The style of her voice and the classical music make for a splendid experience.  I have her other CDs but it is this video of the Christmas classics that is my personal favorite.
This video is going to become a Christmas tradition.",1001376000,2,396,4.410958904109589
1390650,5,B000053VAE,"Another wonderful presentation by Ms. Church. The quality of the sound and imagery is stunning. Her presentation is better than the previous performance. Her ability to effortlessly sing the high notes like ""an angel"" is very remarkable. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates fine music.",984096000,13,295,5.5777777777777775
1390651,4,B000053VAE,Worth watch...she sings just fine and it didn't look like she was forcing her self on the high notes at all...im very impressed with her singing and look very cute during the preformance...a must buy for a church fans..i personally think its better then the first video that came out....shows alot of improvement on her voice.,977788800,6,326,4.839285714285714

7930219,5,B000053VAE,Of all of the albums that I have of Christmas Songs this album is so good that it can hardly be compared to all the others that I have.  It captures the essence of what Christmas is all about with some of the most beautiful and touching songs that I have ever heard.  Charlotte Church was only 14 at the time but she sings better in this album than people twice her age with the elegance and feeling that is missing from almost every other singer of Christmas music in the present day.  If you watch it and listen to it I think that you will love it as I have many times in the past.,1393286400,,583,4.008620689655173

7930224,5,B000053VAE,This is one of the best Christmas performances I have ever seen.
