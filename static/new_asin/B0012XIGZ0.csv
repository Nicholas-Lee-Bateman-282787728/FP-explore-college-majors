3099337,5,B0012XIGZ0,"""Autism: the Musical"" wasn't necessarily something groundbreakingly new, nor was it the most complete view of autism (which can be a great deal worse than what you see in the film), but it was a truly inspired and beautiful vision of hope and understanding.  The children in the film are wonderful and the adults cover the whole range of what people can be.  If this doesn't deeply touch and affect you, then there is something quite wrong.  It's a valuable and important film for everyone to see and I applaud its production.",1207094400,26,526,4.695652173913044
3099338,5,B0012XIGZ0,"As the dad of a very special 10 year Autistic son, I want to say BRAVO to the people who put this work together, it does a great job of showing the reality of the ""wide spectrum"" of Autism. I am ordering several copies of this DVD to share with friends and family.",1207094400,13,264,4.0
3099339,5,B0012XIGZ0,I really liked the way this documentary was put together.  It really shows the wide spectrum of autism and the effects autism has on the people around it.,1207008000,6,154,4.5

3099363,4,B0012XIGZ0,"Enjoyed seeing all the children getting more comfortable and being able to better socialize with each other. I did not feel it was necessary to hear and see the extent to which the parents' lives and choices were affected by their children's condition.
True, being a parent of a special needs child is stressful and can test the strongest of marriages, but the film could have focused more on how the support staff along with the parents worked to address the children's needs..
It could have highlighted their efforts to help make the play not only a successful project, but also a meaningful experience  for everyone that was committed to giving those children  a very creative outlet to their inherent human need to connect with others.",1405468800,,739,4.857142857142857
3099364,5,B0012XIGZ0,Kudos to Elaine Hall. She is an inspiration to all. Her hard work has been worth all of it. It shows in the movie!,1400457600,,114,3.7916666666666665
3099365,5,B0012XIGZ0,My autistic grandson and siblings watched it with me. It was informative and entertaining. It's always good to know that you're not the only one. His siblings need to better understand why he reacts to things differently and understand why he does certain things. I recommend this to anyone who has or knows someone that is autistic.,1396656000,,333,4.859649122807017
3099366,5,B0012XIGZ0,I would like to say that this had my wife and I really like this movie. We let my mom watch it and she loved it that she is going to buy the movie for her self.,1396224000,,160,3.3513513513513513
3099367,5,B0012XIGZ0,"I work with extreme disability children.  Many of them Autistic.  I find Autism very intriguing. This movie does a good job showing the inner struggle of emotion that occurs inside these children who have this extreme communication barrier.  Although, autism may seem like a sad story for a family, this shows what a blessing they are to human existence and the super powers they have deep within.  This movie helps you understand their struggles more.  No matter who you are everyone needs someone who understands you and/or will be their for you during your biggest trials in life.  EVERYONE!",1395446400,,594,4.94949494949495
3099368,5,B0012XIGZ0,Really interesting and fun documentary. I highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the autism spectrum or anything related.,1394928000,,136,5.2272727272727275
3099369,5,B0012XIGZ0,"It certainly helped me to understand autism.
I found the film very powerful with a creative way to tap into the gifts of those on the autism spectrum",1394150400,,149,4.357142857142857
3099380,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Picked this movie up with ""Autism is a world"".  Both are excellent movies.
Autism the musical really tells.the story from the parents perspective and touches a wide array of emotions.  Worth the investment.",1394064000,,206,5.212121212121212
3099381,3,B0012XIGZ0,"Maybe my expectations were too high because of the other reviews, but I was a little disappointed.  I was missing the exciting conclusion.",1388361600,,138,5.0
3099382,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Great DVD! An amazing tool to help give awareness in the world of autism.  I am a grandmother of a 5 year old autistic child and I learned a lot.  The children in this production will grab your heart strings, so I strongly recommend this amazing project.",1376092800,,254,4.382978723404255
3099383,5,B0012XIGZ0,Used this for a group I run for 8-10year olds with autism. They loved it! It's great for kids to recognize the diversity of Autism AND learn empathy for others too.,1376006400,,164,4.32258064516129
3099384,5,B0012XIGZ0,My youngest child has autism and this movie let me see myself in other mothers. It came right on time in great condition.,1375833600,,121,4.304347826086956
3099385,5,B0012XIGZ0,I am a special education teacher with a nephew with Asbergers.  This is a great way for both students and parents to see some of the aspects to autism.  Worth the time to see it.,1373328000,,178,4.057142857142857
3099386,5,B0012XIGZ0,As a child welfare worker I am always looking for materials to share with foster parents.  We used this a training tool and the parents really enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend it to others.,1370908800,,194,4.514285714285714
3099387,5,B0012XIGZ0,This is an absolutely awesome video!! The children (and parents) touch your heart!! I had previously seen it on TV and it was even better the 2nd and even 3rd time I watched it.  I have lent it to 2 friends who also thought it was great!!,1362182400,,238,4.0638297872340425
3099388,5,B0012XIGZ0,This is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. These children are absolutely amazing and Elaine Hall is an inspiration.,1360195200,,126,5.0476190476190474
3099389,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Some reviewers have referred to the kids/families as being ""tragic"" or the movie being sad.  I do not see it that way. I see it as a real depiction of what life with an autistic child is like.  They did not sugar coat it, but that is a good thing.  I loved watching how much the kids grew during the 22 weeks.  Some may say it wasn't much, but it was something. In the end they had worked TOGETHER and they all got on that stage!  That in itself was an accomplishment!  Kudos to the parents and staff involved and to the AMAZING children!",1303344000,,538,4.125
3099390,2,B0012XIGZ0,"After watching this film, I am surprised there were so many positive reviews and high ratings. I want to start out by saying I applaud Elaine Hall for her ambitious endeavor to put a show together with children who have Autism. She shows so much caring and heart, but I have to agree with one reviewer that the film left me feeling despondent. The quality of the documentary cannot be disputed, but its message failed to convey the children's potential or to give a ray of hope that they will eventually find success in life. It could create a prejudice against people with Autism and reduce the possibilities of more research to prevent, treat and eventually find a cure for Autism. A recurring comment I hear from parents on documentaries like this is that society does not value these kids, but if they are portrayed in a predominately unflattering light, little can be done to remedy the situation; they'll be seen as a hopeless cause! The children in this film were beautiful, bright and talented each in their own way, but there were only a few anti-climatic moments of the musical while the bulk of the movie showed the misery, struggles and meltdowns of children and parents alike. I am a realist and as the mother of a child who has Asperger's, I understand the struggles of raising a child in the spectrum. However, there are some moments of discovery, and hard won triumph that should be celebrated, cherished and capitalized on. I would like to have seen a more positive focus and outcome from this film.",1303084800,4,1516,4.681647940074907
3099391,4,B0012XIGZ0,"I was expecting to see the entire musical only and not the parent/family bios this DVD included.  I was very pleased that I was able to hear the families stories.  This DVD was shared with 5 educators and parents within the first week that I owned it.  Truly an inspiration to parents, educators, and individuals on the spectrum!",1292284800,,329,4.637931034482759
3099392,1,B0012XIGZ0,"I expected more. As one who is passionate about the use of Arts in therapy and in human development, I wished there was more about the exciting process that the director undertook to work with these young people in the creation of the original musical. This doco's title is deceptive because there is more about the tragic lives of the families than about the actual musical and work. This doco's reviews talked about how uplifting it was and the title implies something more upbeat and inspirational -it left me feeling rather despondent and helpless for those involved. Is this kind of work not really of benefit for this population of young people?? I believe it is...but the documentary didn't actually focus on this.",1290297600,5,721,4.869918699186992
3099393,5,B0012XIGZ0,"I was first told about this film by one of my students while teaching an introductory course to special education.  I was a bit horrified by the title thinking that someone would make a musical (interpreted to mean ""lighthearted"") from a very serious condition.  I could have not been more wrong! This is an excellent exploration of some autistic children's lives who fall along different places along the autism spectrum and the challenges and hopes of their parents.",1283040000,,468,4.987179487179487
3099394,5,B0012XIGZ0,"I actually saw this show on tv and was very touched and compelled by it, especially because I have a friend whose daughter is autistic.  I hear of the daily struggles that she has to handle, both from her daughter and from her daughter's school.  I was sure she had already seen or heard of this documentary, but I ordered it for her to perhaps share with her daughter's teachers.  She is a constant advocate for her daughter, which I can only imagine, must be exhausting in itself.  Well, it turned out my friend had not seen the video and it really helped her heart as well as her family's.  She mentioned that so many of the comments made in the documentary, she had made herself, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house after watching it.  But it gave her insight and inspiration on how best to approach her daughter's school on certain issues, and maybe asking her teachers to view the video too.  It certainly was an eye-opener for me.  It is very candid, a little bad language (I had forgotten to mention that to my friend), emotional, tear-producing and represents only a peek into the world of those with autism and the loved ones who handle these very special children every day of their lives....  I think every teacher should have to sit down, and watch this, and learn from it.  One day, they may notice there is a particular child in the classroom, who seems......different, but needs their support more than ever.",1268784000,,1428,4.521400778210117
3099395,4,B0012XIGZ0,"This is a well done film about autism, both about the children who have the condition and the parents who deal with it every day.  My wife works in special education and was pleased by the comprehensive picture it presented of the challenges faced both by the kids and their parents, with the latter sometimes finding that their marriages simply can't survive those challenges.

Myself, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more of ""the musical"" in a movie called ""Autism: The Musical"".  The musical is built up over the course of the movie with frequent title cards that say things like ""three weeks before the performance"", ""two weeks before the performance"", etc., yet when we get to the actual musical production performed by the autistic kids, it's just another seven-or-eight-minute vignette among a film comprised of seven-or-eight-minute vignettes.  But that's more of a criticism based on the expectations created by the film's title, rather than a criticism of the film itself.

""Autism: The Musical"" looks and sounds great on DVD, and there are a variety of interesting extra features, mostly involving additional scenes of the kids.",1262563200,,1153,5.111702127659575
3099396,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Unless you have an Autistic child on 'the spectrum', you probably don't know what parents (or other caregivers) have to go through in caring for these wonderful yet demanding children.  The joy and pain can be very taxing phyiscally and mentally.  Without a doubt, the hardest job in the world is parenting Autistic or other 'special needs' children.  The film is about how these kids, with a lot of love and guidance, can 'break barriers' and accomplish surprising feats.  In this case, a special mini-musical/play was put together for a group of Autistic kids, who practiced for weeks, then pulled it off!  The film is full of ups and downs, and you will empathize and cry as you experience what the parents of these kids do to try and help them.",1261008000,,748,4.679389312977099
3099397,5,B0012XIGZ0,"This is put together very well, giving an insight as to what children with Autism have to deal with everyday, and that of their parents/families too. Not enough light is shed on the world of Autism, so this is a very important film too. I laughed and I cried, but throughout, I was inspired. A great film.",1252886400,,305,4.368421052631579
3099398,5,B0012XIGZ0,"My daughter is almost 5 and was diagnosed with autism shortly before turning 3.  Unless you have a child or sibling with autism, you have no idea what day to day living is like.  This movie touches on it and reveals some of the struggles families face as well as the heartwarming side of this puzzling disorder.  My husband and I watched it together first, then I lent it to our daughter's caregiver, her Montessori teacher and currently my mother has it.  I plan to pass this movie along to anyone who works with my daughter and family so they can have a better understanding of what life is like with a loved one who has autism.

I say the premise of Autism: The Musical could easily become a mini-series or reality series because not every issue facing families of children with autism could be covered in this 90 minute documentary.  Seemingly simple everyday tasks like going to the grocery store, the shoe store, family photo sessions at JCPenney, dining out, playdates, sibling issues, etc. could be featured to give viewers an even better understanding of the struggles families face.

Overall, if you know someone who has a child with autism or work with special needs children, it is worth your while to watch Autism: The Musical.",1252713600,9,1240,4.686635944700461

3099403,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Filmed in 2005-2006, this documentary documents the work of The Miracle Project in its first year. The goal was to bring children on the Autism Spectrum together to prepare for a stage production, a musical performance. The participants would learn, grow, and have positive experiences through the months of preparing for the show, the process was educational and a therapy of sorts, with the actual performance being the culmination of their work.

The creator of The Miracle Project is Elaine Hall, a mother of a boy with Autism. The show opens with her telling her story of her marriage and hopes to be a mother, of her infertility struggle and their dream of parenting was fulfilled when they adopted a toddler from a Russian orphanage. Only after coming home and experiencing numerous problems, was the boy finally diagnosed with Autism. After trying many therapies she credits Stanley Greenspan with giving her the idea to go into the child's world in order to connect with them and to draw them out and to be a part of the rest of the world. Her son responded well to alternative therapies with actors and dancers who were able to connect to her son more than the mainstream therapists did. She had this idea and she did create and run a structured program, a nonprofit organization called The Miracle Project, that would invite children on the Autism Spectrum and their typically-developing siblings perform a stage production together.

The film focuses on the entire process from conception to planning, rehearsing, and culminating with seeing parts of the final production. There is a large cast of children in the musical but this film focuses on the lives of five children who are at different areas of the Autism Spectrum. We meet the parents of the featured children and hear their stories from birth through noticing something was wrong, how they were diagnosed, some of the therapies they tried and of the child's current strengths and weaknesses. We see how the child appears on the outside and to us as strangers and we hear from the parents what the children are `really like'. We learn what types of education they are getting and of some struggles with the educational system. We learn also that some marriages were strained and how some of the couples separated or divorced and as a nice balance, see Elaine Hall begin dating a new man which we find out at the end, culminates in marriage. Other examples of how Autism changed the parent's lives is one mother suffered badly with depression and another gave up an acting and modeling career to dedicate her time to full-time mothering. How Autism affects Autism affects the entire family, even sometimes extended family, was clearly shown. The dedication of the parents to find the best care and education for their children is clearly seen. Different methods of education are being used by the children with varying degrees of satisfaction and progress. We also hear the parent's concerns about what their children will be like as adults and what their lives might be like as adults. The parents speak with brutal honesty from the heart.

I feel the film was a good mix of optimism and feeling happy for the children's growth and development that occurred as a direct result of their participation in the musical while also showing the negative side: the challenges and struggles of the children themselves as well as their family's problems. I shed both tears of joy and tears of pity for the children and the families as I watched it. I wanted to reach out and hug the children and praise them, as well as give their parents encouragement and kudos for their hard work.

Some of the best parts were the interviews with the children where they explain what life is like for them and what bothers them and what makes them happy. Discussions of the problems of and why children with Autism choose to retreat into their own world and bullying issues at school touched me deeply. Bullying is an issue for one child and bullying is one of the bigger topics discussed as a challenge to chidlren's socialization and as a problem in public school. When the least verbal child is shown how to use a device to type his thoughts out, I was surprised (based on his outside appearance and actions) how eloquent he was and what he had to say.

As of today people are still debating the exact cause of Autism or if it is a combination of many things. This film doesn't concentrate on that topic. This film doesn't discuss all the different therapies and how to treat Autism. Instead the film gives just enough background information on the families to learn some things about their journey. It is clear that all the parents are working hard to find the best care and services for their child. Some things these children and their parents say may help parents of children on the Autism Spectrum, inspiring them to action, help sustain their dedication, or at least that they are not alone.

I feel this movie may help other people understand Autism more and may raise the concern about what our society needs to be thinking about and doing about Autism. This Autism problem doesn't seem to be going away, there is still no easy or miracle cures yet. We need to think about things such as getting a correct diagnosis and not giving misdiagnoses, about getting an early diagnosis, about right and best therapies and services at the earliest age possible, about better options in the public education system and lastly, how our society can help adults with Autism survive and thrive if they are unable to fully care for themselves.

I felt the movie was very well balanced between the general information and challenges that Autism presents, with the hopeful and uplifting parts and seeing things that elicit a smile, and the story of the musical production itself. For me this was first and foremost about Autism and the real people living with it, and secondarily about the musical and The Miracle Project.

This documentary was filmed in 2005-2006 and was released in 2007. It has won multiple awards including two Emmy's in 2008. It aired on HBO in 2008 and was released on DVD on May 13, 2008.

Check your public library to see if they have a copy in circulation. If not, consider suggesting your library purchase a copy for their holdings. Most libraries have a special fund set aside to purchase media requested by its citizens. If you have HBO check their schedule for airtimes. Or consider purchasing a copy. Currently, Amazon.com sells it at a discount. It should go without saying that this belongs in the lending libraries of all Autism support groups.

In some of my reviews I mention issues for parents who are considering having their children consume the media I'm reviewing. My note to parents who are considering having their children watch this, (as I did with my own children) is: this film contains a few uses of the profanity word f--. It also discusses one parent who formerly was a Playboy centerfold and shows two of the photos from the magazine, one a backlit but darkened body silhouette that clearly indicated she was nude and another where she was scantily clad in a tasteful yet erotic presentation. This film has a rating of ""not rated"". After viewing this once I decided to watch it with my children as they are struggling to accept and tolerate the different behaviors of their cousin. Many topics are serious such as mentioning an affair, marital separation and divorce, and clinical depression. One parent mentions the option of killing herself and then says she hopes her child dies before she does (because she worries of who will be caring for her in adulthood). If you are considering showing this to your children I suggest you view it first and make your own choice. I don't believe this movie was ever intended for young children to watch but I felt in our family's case that it had some good things that I wanted my children to see and then we discussed it.",1230681600,4,7956,4.758695652173913
3099404,1,B0012XIGZ0,"Gotta love the irony here -- a feel good film about a disability yet no closed-captioning for disabled people.

Docurama doesn't caption hardly any of their DVDs. They don't care about hearing-impaired viewers.

I give it a ZERO rating because the DVD is totally USELESS to hearing-impaired people. Shame on you Docurama.

3099407,5,B0012XIGZ0,"It has been some months since I first saw this film, and I found it to be entertaining and educational, but most of all extremely moving.  It shows why autism is considered a spectrum disorder, and how both people with autism and their families cope in the many ways humans do.  There is nothing sentimental about the film, and yet is is very humanistic, in the best sense of the word.  Kudos to the director and all those involved.  Anybody who has someone affected by autism will be moved, and the general public would do itself a favor by watching this inspiring documentary.",1222214400,6,578,4.58252427184466

Adam is an autistic savant who is an amazing cellist, and loves to chase girls on the playground. Henry has AS and is the son of Stephen Stills, and is a walking encyclopedia on reptiles and dinosaurs. Neal is non-verbal and was adopted from Russia and diagnosed autistic soon after adoption. His mom, Elaine, runs the program. Wyatt has high-functioning autism, and is very smart and witty. Lexi is the only girl that is focused on, and she doesn't quite have a severe form.

3099409,5,B0012XIGZ0,I have a 5 year old who has Autism and I thought this movie was right on!  What I liked most was that it illustrated the full spectrum of autism.  It told stories of quirky kids with aspergers and high-functioning autism as well as kids who are non-verbal with severe communication and social impairments.  The best part is that the viewer gets to see all of these kids together as they are led by a wonderful mom who ambitiousy directs them in the production of a play.

I liked the fact that she did not hide the difficulties these children can have, but she still showed that they are so much more than just that (a fact that can easily be forgotten when the child has a meltdown at the grocery store).  I also liked that the director unflinchingly showed just how angry and frustrated that we parents can become, and that that anger and frustration has its roots in the fact that we are fiercely protective of ours and we fear what happens if we are not here.  At the same time, those kids were amazing and fantastic and she showed it.  Adam is a little ladies man in the making, Lexi has a lovely singing voice, Henry and Wyatt are just absolute stars, and maybe the reason Neal does not talk is simply because the rest of us don't speak angel yet.

I want to start out by saying I applaud Elaine Hall for her ambitious endeavor to put a show together with children who have Autism. She shows so much caring and heart, but I have to agree with one reviewer that the film left me feeling despondent. The quality of the documentary cannot be disputed, but its message failed to convey the children's potential or to give a ray of hope that they will eventually find success in life. It could create a prejudice against people with Autism and reduce the possibilities of more research to prevent, treat and eventually find a cure for Autism. A recurring comment I hear from parents on documentaries like this is that society does not value these kids, but if they are portrayed in a predominately unflattering light, little can be done to remedy the situation; they'll be seen as a hopeless cause! The children in this film were beautiful, bright and talented each in their own way, but there were only a few anti-climatic moments of the musical while the bulk of the movie showed the misery, struggles and meltdowns of children and parents alike. I am a realist and as the mother of a child who has Asperger's, I understand the struggles of raising a child in the spectrum. However, there are some moments of discovery, and hard won triumph that should be celebrated, cherished and capitalized on.

As one who is passionate about the use of Arts in therapy and in human development, I wished there was more about the exciting process that the director undertook to work with these young people in the creation of the original musical. This doco's title is deceptive because there is more about the tragic lives of the families than about the actual musical and work. This doco's reviews talked about how uplifting it was and the title implies something more upbeat and inspirational -it left me feeling rather despondent and helpless for those involved. Is this kind of work not really of benefit for this population of young people?? I believe it is...but the documentary didn't actually focus on this.",1290297600,5,721,4.869918699186992

I hear of the daily struggles that she has to handle, both from her daughter and from her daughter's school.  I was sure she had already seen or heard of this documentary, but I ordered it for her to perhaps share with her daughter's teachers.  She is a constant advocate for her daughter, which I can only imagine, must be exhausting in itself.  Well, it turned out my friend had not seen the video and it really helped her heart as well as her family's.  She mentioned that so many of the comments made in the documentary, she had made herself, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house after watching it.  But it gave her insight and inspiration on how best to approach her daughter's school on certain issues, and maybe asking her teachers to view the video too.  It certainly was an eye-opener for me.  It is very candid, a little bad language (I had forgotten to mention that to my friend), emotional, tear-producing and represents only a peek into the world of those with autism and the loved ones who handle these very special children every day of their lives....  I think every teacher should have to sit down, and watch this, and learn from it.  One day, they may notice there is a particular child in the classroom, who seems......different, but needs their support more than ever.",1268784000,,1428,4.521400778210117

My wife works in special education and was pleased by the comprehensive picture it presented of the challenges faced both by the kids and their parents, with the latter sometimes finding that their marriages simply can't survive those challenges.

Myself, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more of ""the musical"" in a movie called ""Autism: The Musical"".  The musical is built up over the course of the movie with frequent title cards that say things like ""three weeks before the performance"", ""two weeks before the performance"", etc., yet when we get to the actual musical production performed by the autistic kids, it's just another seven-or-eight-minute vignette among a film comprised of seven-or-eight-minute vignettes.  But that's more of a criticism based on the expectations created by the film's title, rather than a criticism of the film itself.

""Autism: The Musical"" looks and sounds great on DVD, and there are a variety of interesting extra features, mostly involving additional scenes of the kids.",1262563200,,1153,5.111702127659575

The joy and pain can be very taxing phyiscally and mentally.  Without a doubt, the hardest job in the world is parenting Autistic or other 'special needs' children.  The film is about how these kids, with a lot of love and guidance, can 'break barriers' and accomplish surprising feats.  In this case, a special mini-musical/play was put together for a group of Autistic kids, who practiced for weeks, then pulled it off!  The film is full of ups and downs, and you will empathize and cry as you experience what the parents of these kids do to try and help them.",1261008000,,748,4.679389312977099

Unless you have a child or sibling with autism, you have no idea what day to day living is like.  This movie touches on it and reveals some of the struggles families face as well as the heartwarming side of this puzzling disorder.  My husband and I watched it together first, then I lent it to our daughter's caregiver, her Montessori teacher and currently my mother has it.  I plan to pass this movie along to anyone who works with my daughter and family so they can have a better understanding of what life is like with a loved one who has autism.

I say the premise of Autism: The Musical could easily become a mini-series or reality series because not every issue facing families of children with autism could be covered in this 90 minute documentary.  Seemingly simple everyday tasks like going to the grocery store, the shoe store, family photo sessions at JCPenney, dining out, playdates, sibling issues, etc. could be featured to give viewers an even better understanding of the struggles families face.

3333900,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Filmed in 2005-2006, this documentary documents the work of The Miracle Project in its first year. The goal was to bring children on the Autism Spectrum together to prepare for a stage production, a musical performance. The participants would learn, grow, and have positive experiences through the months of preparing for the show, the process was educational and a therapy of sorts, with the actual performance being the culmination of their work.

The creator of The Miracle Project is Elaine Hall, a mother of a boy with Autism. The show opens with her telling her story of her marriage and hopes to be a mother, of her infertility struggle and their dream of parenting was fulfilled when they adopted a toddler from a Russian orphanage. Only after coming home and experiencing numerous problems, was the boy finally diagnosed with Autism. After trying many therapies she credits Stanley Greenspan with giving her the idea to go into the child's world in order to connect with them and to draw them out and to be a part of the rest of the world. Her son responded well to alternative therapies with actors and dancers who were able to connect to her son more than the mainstream therapists did. She had this idea and she did create and run a structured program, a nonprofit organization called The Miracle Project, that would invite children on the Autism Spectrum and their typically-developing siblings perform a stage production together.

The film focuses on the entire process from conception to planning, rehearsing, and culminating with seeing parts of the final production. There is a large cast of children in the musical but this film focuses on the lives of five children who are at different areas of the Autism Spectrum. We meet the parents of the featured children and hear their stories from birth through noticing something was wrong, how they were diagnosed, some of the therapies they tried and of the child's current strengths and weaknesses. We see how the child appears on the outside and to us as strangers and we hear from the parents what the children are `really like'. We learn what types of education they are getting and of some struggles with the educational system. We learn also that some marriages were strained and how some of the couples separated or divorced and as a nice balance, see Elaine Hall begin dating a new man which we find out at the end, culminates in marriage. Other examples of how Autism changed the parent's lives is one mother suffered badly with depression and another gave up an acting and modeling career to dedicate her time to full-time mothering. How Autism affects Autism affects the entire family, even sometimes extended family, was clearly shown. The dedication of the parents to find the best care and education for their children is clearly seen. Different methods of education are being used by the children with varying degrees of satisfaction and progress. We also hear the parent's concerns about what their children will be like as adults and what their lives might be like as adults. The parents speak with brutal honesty from the heart.

I feel the film was a good mix of optimism and feeling happy for the children's growth and development that occurred as a direct result of their participation in the musical while also showing the negative side: the challenges and struggles of the children themselves as well as their family's problems. I shed both tears of joy and tears of pity for the children and the families as I watched it. I wanted to reach out and hug the children and praise them, as well as give their parents encouragement and kudos for their hard work.

Some of the best parts were the interviews with the children where they explain what life is like for them and what bothers them and what makes them happy. Discussions of the problems of and why children with Autism choose to retreat into their own world and bullying issues at school touched me deeply. Bullying is an issue for one child and bullying is one of the bigger topics discussed as a challenge to chidlren's socialization and as a problem in public school. When the least verbal child is shown how to use a device to type his thoughts out, I was surprised (based on his outside appearance and actions) how eloquent he was and what he had to say.

As of today people are still debating the exact cause of Autism or if it is a combination of many things. This film doesn't concentrate on that topic. This film doesn't discuss all the different therapies and how to treat Autism. Instead the film gives just enough background information on the families to learn some things about their journey. It is clear that all the parents are working hard to find the best care and services for their child. Some things these children and their parents say may help parents of children on the Autism Spectrum, inspiring them to action, help sustain their dedication, or at least that they are not alone.

I feel this movie may help other people understand Autism more and may raise the concern about what our society needs to be thinking about and doing about Autism. This Autism problem doesn't seem to be going away, there is still no easy or miracle cures yet. We need to think about things such as getting a correct diagnosis and not giving misdiagnoses, about getting an early diagnosis, about right and best therapies and services at the earliest age possible, about better options in the public education system and lastly, how our society can help adults with Autism survive and thrive if they are unable to fully care for themselves.

I felt the movie was very well balanced between the general information and challenges that Autism presents, with the hopeful and uplifting parts and seeing things that elicit a smile, and the story of the musical production itself. For me this was first and foremost about Autism and the real people living with it, and secondarily about the musical and The Miracle Project.

This documentary was filmed in 2005-2006 and was released in 2007. It has won multiple awards including two Emmy's in 2008. It aired on HBO in 2008 and was released on DVD on May 13, 2008.

Check your public library to see if they have a copy in circulation. If not, consider suggesting your library purchase a copy for their holdings. Most libraries have a special fund set aside to purchase media requested by its citizens. If you have HBO check their schedule for airtimes. Or consider purchasing a copy. Currently, Amazon.com sells it at a discount. It should go without saying that this belongs in the lending libraries of all Autism support groups.

In some of my reviews I mention issues for parents who are considering having their children consume the media I'm reviewing. My note to parents who are considering having their children watch this, (as I did with my own children) is: this film contains a few uses of the profanity word f--. It also discusses one parent who formerly was a Playboy centerfold and shows two of the photos from the magazine, one a backlit but darkened body silhouette that clearly indicated she was nude and another where she was scantily clad in a tasteful yet erotic presentation. This film has a rating of ""not rated"". After viewing this once I decided to watch it with my children as they are struggling to accept and tolerate the different behaviors of their cousin. Many topics are serious such as mentioning an affair, marital separation and divorce, and clinical depression. One parent mentions the option of killing herself and then says she hopes her child dies before she does (because she worries of who will be caring for her in adulthood). If you are considering showing this to your children I suggest you view it first and make your own choice. I don't believe this movie was ever intended for young children to watch but I felt in our family's case that it had some good things that I wanted my children to see and then we discussed it.",1230681600,4,7956,4.758695652173913

Don't spend your money on a company that distributes a film about a disability but doesn't make it accessible to many disabled people.",1228089600,14,457,5.066666666666666

3333903,5,B0012XIGZ0,This was a great movie being a parent of a 3 year old girl with autism and being around other autistic kids you kinda have a appreciation for movies that come along like this.  I do know there are plenty of kids that are worse than the ones shown in this movie but this does bring an awareness.,1224547200,3,294,4.068965517241379
3333904,5,B0012XIGZ0,"It has been some months since I first saw this film, and I found it to be entertaining and educational, but most of all extremely moving.  It shows why autism is considered a spectrum disorder, and how both people with autism and their families cope in the many ways humans do.  There is nothing sentimental about the film, and yet is is very humanistic, in the best sense of the word.  Kudos to the director and all those involved.  Anybody who has someone affected by autism will be moved, and the general public would do itself a favor by watching this inspiring documentary.",1222214400,6,578,4.58252427184466
3333905,5,B0012XIGZ0,"First off: I absolutely ADORE this movie! Every time it comes on TV I just HAVE to watch it.
Adam is an autistic savant who is an amazing cellist, and loves to chase girls on the playground. Henry has AS and is the son of Stephen Stills, and is a walking encyclopedia on reptiles and dinosaurs. Neal is non-verbal and was adopted from Russia and diagnosed autistic soon after adoption. His mom, Elaine, runs the program. Wyatt has high-functioning autism, and is very smart and witty. Lexi is the only girl that is focused on, and she doesn't quite have a severe form.
I love how the movie turned out at the end and I would recommend it to anybody.",1221436800,5,648,4.408333333333333
3333906,5,B0012XIGZ0,I have a 5 year old who has Autism and I thought this movie was right on!  What I liked most was that it illustrated the full spectrum of autism.  It told stories of quirky kids with aspergers and high-functioning autism as well as kids who are non-verbal with severe communication and social impairments.  The best part is that the viewer gets to see all of these kids together as they are led by a wonderful mom who ambitiousy directs them in the production of a play.  Very inspiring!,1220745600,5,487,4.438202247191011

3333908,5,B0012XIGZ0,"As a parent and sibling of people with autism, and a part of the special education system, I found this DVD to be very moving, inspiring, thoughtful and honest.  It showed the variety of symptoms that can be associated with ASD and how different people cope with them, and the stress on family members and the individuals themselves.",1218844800,,333,4.741379310344827
3333909,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Absolutely wonderful!  Whether you have years of experience with autism or know nothing about it, you'll love it.  This movie helps to give a face to autism, and to break the ""Rainman"" mentality I find a lot of people seem to have.",1218672000,,231,4.476190476190476
3333910,5,B0012XIGZ0,"Excellent film! I saw my son in so many of these children, and myself in so many of the mothers. This film is a must-have for anyone who has someone autistic in their world. Amazing to see what can happen with a little love.",1218412800,,224,4.113636363636363

3333912,5,B0012XIGZ0,"I saw this movie in at a theatre long before it came out on HBO because I don't take cable. I laughed, I cried, I was completely taken by this movie. I left deeply moved and went right home after seeing it and emailed the makers of the movie to let me know when it was available for sale. They emailed me and I bought it. It still makes me laugh, cry and moves me beyond belief. I love this movie and highly recommend it if you know or love someone who has autism, or is the parent of a person with autism, works with people with autism or just want to know a little more about how it effects any of these people.",1214438400,,613,3.9516129032258065

This is a wonderful documentary where I learned more about the life of those living with autism: both the child and his/her family.  The woman who is putting on the musical with this wonderful group of autistic children does an amazing service to the kids, their families, and all who watch this film.",1212192000,,407,4.8

3333915,5,B0012XIGZ0,"As a mom of a child with autism, I was eager to see this film after it was released. I have since seen it 4 times. The first viewing was at an autism conference in a room with a few hundred parents and family members of individuals with autism. To say it was breathtaking is an understatement. We were all on the edges of our seats, laughed, cried, nodded our heads and glanced at our fellow viewers throughout the film with looks that said, ""Uh huh. Me too. Us too. I know how that feels. We've been there."" I can only say ""thank you"" to all those involved with this sweet, sad, sensitive and realistic view of the autism experience. Bravo to those who made this happen. And to the brave and gorgeous children featured, my your paths be paved with magic and peace.",1211673600,2,765,4.319444444444445
3333916,5,B0012XIGZ0,"I am the mother of an an almost 5 year old autistic boy, and I had been itching to see Autism: The Musical.  Now that I have, I am so touched and amazed by what went into that film.  I liked the fact that she did not hide the difficulties these children can have, but she still showed that they are so much more than just that (a fact that can easily be forgotten when the child has a meltdown at the grocery store).  I also liked that the director unflinchingly showed just how angry and frustrated that we parents can become, and that that anger and frustration has its roots in the fact that we are fiercely protective of ours and we fear what happens if we are not here.  At the same time, those kids were amazing and fantastic and she showed it.  Adam is a little ladies man in the making, Lexi has a lovely singing voice, Henry and Wyatt are just absolute stars, and maybe the reason Neal does not talk is simply because the rest of us don't speak angel yet.  Everyone should watch this.",1211500800,28,993,4.2
8248072,1,B0012XIGZ0,"This movie is propaganda for all the negative stereotypes about autism. I thought I was going to see the kids' opinions about theater-making and creativity (and was hoping for some ideas for theater classes for kiddos), but really it's a bunch of parents who want sympathy belaboring how bad their lives are because their kid is autistic, with very little footage of the actual play-making, and only a montage of partial scenes from the play itself. Get over it, whiny parents. You know what's worse? Being an autistic kid and having to hear you say mean things about us all the time. Parents like that are probably why so many of us are incredibly depressed and anxious all the time. I really wanted to watch some kids explore theater and flourish finding new ways to communicate, but even what little theater practice we witness in this film makes it look like none of the kids got to explore new ways to communicate, and instead the play making was all about trying to get them to communicate the way non-autistic people want us to communicate. Why is the main character a parent? The main character should have been one (or several) of the kids!!!!!!!! I did not feel that anyone was presuming the kids' competence (which is not only how I want to be treated, as an autistic person, but also how the theater program I participated in was run). Also there's tons of harmful myths included in this film that make people love to hate autistics.",1512691200,,1445,4.6484375

Be careful for what type of machine that you can only play it on.  Some of these I was unable to play because it was some foreign machine that I needed.  One of these had verbal language that I totally didn't appreciate.  I got rid of all three DVD's and would never recommend or purchase again.",1450483200,,424,4.3164556962025316
