4497673,5,B004XVMCQM,"This movie was about the love and faith of two friends. It wasn't about who was right or who was wrong. I loved every person in this movie. It showed that children are so filled with love and hope. It showed that even a dad who didn't understand his son's could come to at least try to understand them. And it showed a Priest and a Rabbi with the ability to give unconditional love. Tearjerker, but worth every one of them.",1363737600,,423,4.234567901234568
4497674,5,B004XVMCQM,"Bought this for my grandchildren after seeing it myself on a rental.  I thought it was so special the way it depicted the differences in religions, and how the boys bonded and accepted each other, while the Catholic father was much less understanding.  I haven't not heard what the grandchildren thought of it.  ( They are in Hawaii now.)",1353715200,,338,4.694915254237288
4497675,5,B004XVMCQM,"Stolen Summer is heartwarming. I am smiling as I write this. Two beautiful boys, whose wisdom transcends grown-up words is exemplified in their pure thought, life's questions and play. The authenticity of the mid-70's Catholic and Jewish families lives .... one large and loud, the other small and introspective,although stereotypes, (and who cares when the movie and messages are this good) hit home with me.. I could relate.",1352851200,,426,5.279411764705882
4497676,1,B004XVMCQM,"I was really impressed with the movie Stolen Summer, so when I heard there was a documentary about it's making I check it out.  Mistake.  It almost seemed one of their objectives was to see how much trash talk they could use within each segment.
