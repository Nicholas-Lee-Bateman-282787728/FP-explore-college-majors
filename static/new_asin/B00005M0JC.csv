7944633,1,B00005M0JC,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD from Retro Media. Other reviews have warned about the terrible quality of the source print and its production on this DVD.  They said the quality was so bad it was hard to watch.  I was prepared to put up with a poor quality image but the DVD would not play at all in any of the FIVE players I tried it in as well as three computers. Stay away from this disc, it's probably not worth the effort to watch ... if you can get it to play at all.",1304208000,,479,3.9278350515463916
7944634,2,B00005M0JC,"I grew up with the Philippino horror flicks (particularly the ""blood trilogy"") on cable TV in the 70's and was happy to see it available (at a budget price to boot) by Retromedia, but I have to agree with the previous reviewers with the headache-inducing ""print"" (probably from an old vhs tape, judging by the bleeding colors and lack of detail) that Retromedia used for the DVD. However, the same movie is available on DVD from Image Entertainment under the title of ""Blood Of The Vampires"" (from ""the blood collection"" series) that's vastly superior in terms of picture quality and special features (audio commentary track by Sam Sherman, video interview with Eddie Romero, still gallery, etc.) If you're a fan of Philippino horror (as I am), you won't be dissappointed.
I'm sure Fred Olen Ray had good intentions releasing this disc, but it's not worth your valuable time and money. Stick to the Image DVD.
Peace!",1080777600,6,916,4.878205128205129
