8457024,4,B0054SEUTA,"Some movies stay with you long after watching it even though you know those films are not perfect, even deeply flawed. ""Son of Babylon,"" directed by Bagdad-born Mohamed Al Daradji (who studied filmmaking in the Netherlands and England), is one of such films. Iraq's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film in 2010, the film was not nominated. This is not surprising. The film's pace is slow and though told with occasional humor, its subject matter is somber. But the film is made with sincerity and emotional power that will appeal to anyone no matter where he or she is.

Part road movie, ""Son of Babylon"" is set in 2003, just three weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. The film follows a long cross-country journey of a Kurdish grandmother (Shazada Hussein) and her grandson Ahmed (Yasser Talib). With Ahmed grudgingly obliging, the grandmother is determined to find her missing son (and Ahmed's father), who went to the Gulf War and has not returned since then. The only clue he has got is a letter from his son's friend, telling that Ahmed's father was spotted in a prison in Iraq's southern city of Nasiriyah.

Their travel is not easy (only Ahmed can speak Arabic), but most people they meet on their way are kind, trying to help the travelers within their limited means. Two episodes are memorable. One is about a young boy selling cigarettes at the Bagdad bus terminal. The other is a middle-aged man Musa (Bashir Al Majid), who has a strong reason to help the grandmother and Ahmed.

The narrative is slow and sometimes heavy-handed, but avoiding preachy didacticism, ""Son of Babylon"" works effectively not only as a strong statement about humanity in confusion and uncertainty in Iraq, but as a moving story of a young innocent boy who grows up seeing the grim reality surrounding him.",1313712000,5,1818,4.82051282051282
