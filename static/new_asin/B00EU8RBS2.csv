5943905,1,B00EU8RBS2,why would wwe not put this out in bluray like the years before?. i may pass on this. good match listing tho,1387238400,3,107,3.909090909090909
5943906,3,B00EU8RBS2,"I'm pretty sure that the blu-ray is a Best Buy exclusive.  It has a SKU on their website. Their exclusives tend to be released for the non-big box crowd a couple months after their release.  As I generally hate Best Buy, I'll be waiting for a wider release.",1386979200,2,257,4.333333333333333
5943907,1,B00EU8RBS2,With quite a string of releases not being released for Blu Ray (Most notable for Me was the exclusion of The Raw 20th Anniversary set) It leaves me disapointed to not see these sets in the highest quality possible.,1385942400,6,214,4.512820512820513
5943908,4,B00EU8RBS2,"No different than the previous collections, WWE wants to put this collection out before the end of the year so matches from the Survivor Series & T.L.C. events are not included.  And as a side note, the Blu-Ray version is not available in the United States due to the low sales of the previous editions.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. The Rock - Both men started off trading fist with the brawl going in & out of the ring with a funny part happening with Rock taking off the lid of the spanish announce table only for Punk to keep putting it back on & even doing a comedic jester to the announcers. A distraction by Heyman allowed Punk to take control using a unique head vice submission while also taking the match back on the outside with a springboard dropkick to Rock on the apron, top rope double axe handle, and suicide dive. They eventually continued to trade momentum allowing for some good sequences like a GTS to Rock Bottom to Anaconda Vice to pin attempt & later how Rock was able to counter a pin attempt by Punk into the Sharpshooter as the action continued back on the outside & in the ring that eventually resulted in one announce tables destroyed before the lights went out & the other table was broken as well. While this was another case where I personally wouldn't have chosen the guy who did win the match, I won't deny that this was a quality match between the two that at times did come off as a fight as much as a wrestling match.
Royal Rumble

John Cena, Ryback, Sheamus vs. The Shield - Cena's team didn't wait for the Shield to come to the ring as they got to them before the match started after they made their way to the ring over the barricade brawling in & out of the ring including a triple vertical suplex. Both teams traded momentum with Sheamus & Cena gaining momentum taking on each member one at a time before The Shield would regain & keep control with teamwork between two or all three members including isolating Cena away from his teammates keeping him in their half of the ring or taking out one member of the team when they were focused on another. Nice six man tag with an extra credit going to J.B.L. on commentary as the point he kept making throughout the contest was played out during the match in that, ""Cena & Sheamus & Ryback were allies but The Shield is a team.""
Elimination Chamber

Undertaker vs. C.M. Punk - Punk made his entrance with the group Living Colour performing ""Cult Of Personality"" while Paul Heyman had the urn symbolizing the late-Paul Bearer with Punk continuing to disrespect Undertaker tossing the urn around & even slapping Taker in the face causing Taker to respond in a dominate fashion with his strikes & big boot while driving Punk back first into the ring post & ""vintage"" apron legdrop before Punk was able to catch Taker off guard during Old School only for Punk to continue to show disrespect for Taker & taking it to the air with top rope moves like his Savage Elbow including one to the outside that ended up hurting himself just as much or even more than it did Taker. Both men continued to trade momentum by trading blows or using their various trademark moves such as the Anaconda Vice, G.T.S., Tombstone, and Last Ride with the other men somehow continuing to find a way to counter or escape the hold which resulted in the best match these two have had against each other & heavily surpassing their feud back in 2009.
WrestleMania

WWE Champion The Rock vs. John Cena - Both men started off with various stalemates early as each man was able to take the other man down before Cena whipped Rock hard into the corner where you saw it take an effect allowing Cena to ground Rock & keep him down with suplexes & slams. Momentum started to trade as both men knew each other so well from their previous match that they had a counter for each other's offense from the spinebuster to five knuckle shuffle to even submissions like the STF & sharpshooter as they continued to try to one up each other eventually hitting their moves after multiple attempts along with the strong finishers like the Rock Bottom & Attitude Adjustment before going back to trading fist & even stealing the other guys signature moves to the point where you saw a moment of ""deva vu."" I have to give credit & respect to both men as they've only had one other match against each other in their careers which was a year ago yet was able to come out & deliver a completely different match against each other that also played off the effects of the match a year earlier plus as we would later find out that The Rock got seriously injured early in the match to the point where he needed surgery yet still went so knowing that now, I'll give it more credit.
WrestleMania

Extreme Rules Match: Randy Orton vs. Big Show - Randy Orton's returns to his hometown of St. Louis & attempted to go extreme right away using weapons like kendo sticks on the outside only for Show to easily turn it against Orton & destroy it in the process before repeatedly chopping Orton & working over his shoulder but Orton went after Show's legs to take away the size advantage only for Show to be able to catch Orton on the top rope sending him to the floor followed by setting up a ladder scaffold across two chairs to setup for a Vader Bomb only for Orton to later use a chair himself in various ways in an attempt to keep Show down including resorting to something that we haven't seen from him in a long time.
Extreme Rules

Steel Cage Match: Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - This was the debut of a new steel cage that's more of a smaller version of Hell In A Cell with the reinforced walls (similar to the type of steel cage TNA/Impact Wrestling has been using since they stopped using the six sided ring). Triple H started this off with a bang attacking Brock as he was making his way to the ring & even giving Heyman a shot for his troubles before going into the cage & sending Brock head first into the cage more than once before Brock was able to use his power to shift momentum his direction easily tossing & ramming Triple H into the cage multiple times but injured his knee when it rammed into the cage to the point where he was screaming in pain with Triple H being able to escape the Kimora Lock by attacking the leg with Triple H continuing to beat on it. Paul Heyman made his presence known in Brock's favor allowing Brock to execute the F5 on one leg while Triple H was able to use a chair to damage Brock's leg along with moves like various leg submissions to the point where Brock was close to escaping at one point where Triple H attacking the leg to stopped him before Triple H was able to pull out his favorite weapon with bad intentions. I felt out of their series of three matches, this was the best one they've had with them telling the story of Brock being the beast he's always been but also the most vulnerable we've seen him in the previous year since his return.
Extreme Rules

Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. The Miz vs. Curtis Axel - This was originally scheduled for a triple threat with Fandango but was replaced by Axel due to the concussion he suffered. Heyman played a important part right from the start advising Axel to stay to the outside & pick his moments which we did see from time to time along with other action such as moments where one man hit an offensive move on his opponent only for the third man to deliver another maneuver right after, everyone in the match having a one on one face off at some point in the match, everyone breaking up pin attempts, and plenty of back & forth sequences with an ending that I've never seen before in this type of match. This was a non-stop action opening match that showcased each man well at moments but will mostly be remembered for the history this result made on the day of this event.
Payback

Divas Champion Kaitlyn vs. A.J. Lee - Kaitlyn was out for revenge for her entire ""secret admirer"" being nothing more than a setup for months & she showcased that when he went after A.J. right away pounding on her & even tossing her over the announce table before A.J. was able to recover & target Kaitlyn's neck with neckbreakers & the sleeperhold while Kaitlyn used power moves like clotheslines & spears as both women traded momentum countering each others holds like Kaitlyn powering out of A.J.'s crucifix & Kaitlyn catching A.J. during a crossbody attempt only to reverse that into the Black Widow before one woman made a mistake of being more concentrated on beating her at her own game than winning the match. This was hands down the best Divas' match in recent history as both girls came into this match & played it out as if this was a fight.
Payback

World Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio - Dolph came out to a heavy amount of crowd support & kept stalling early while still showing signs of his recent concussion causing Del Rio to target his head with kicks & knees along with a back suplex that bounced his head off the mat before going to the outside with his head bouncing off the mat & announce table to the point where Big E. Langston tried to step in only for Del Rio to continue to be ruthless with headbutts & more kicks but Dolph was able to keep kicking out & mount some offense but easily showing effects such as nothing getting most of the Fameasser & a Zig Zag that landed him on his head as Del Rio just continued to kick in the skull of Dolph to the point where the crowd completely turned on Alberto. This wasn't a competitive match that we know they're capable of doing in favor of telling the story of Dolph fighting against the odds & Del Rio being completely ruthless causing the fans to favor one man over the other (similar to another match that was held on a Chicago PPV around 16 years earlier) & did an excellent job at what this match was designed to do.
Payback

World Heavyweight Championship Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett vs. Fandango vs. Jack Swagger vs. Antonio Cesaro vs. Dean Ambrose - While the WWE Title Money in The Bank match later in the night featured former WWE/World Champion ""All-Stars"", this match focused on superstars of the future that featured many stories & moments such as the tag teams of Rhodes Scholars & Real Americans working together only to eventually face off, ladders used as weapons various times such a Barrett using a piece of the ladder rung to beat on Sandow, multiple backdrops onto the ladder, Fandango's sunset flip off the top of the ladder, Dean Ambrose taking a page out of Terry Funk's playbook, the creative ways Ambrose & Swagger & Cesaro tried to grab the case, Cody Rhodes busted open, outside associates getting involved, and one partner double crossing another. This was the action expected from this match.
Money In The Bank
[Straight To The Top: Money In The Bank Anthology]

No Disqualification Match: C.M. Punk vs. Brock Lesnar - ""The Best vs. The Beast"" started off strong with Brock powering Punk into the corner with strong shoulder drives & kept easily tossing him around before Punk was able to take Brock down & to the outside followed by a suicide dive & attempted to use the steel steps only for Brock to forcefully power through knocking the steps back onto Punk as both men traded momentum on the outside with Punk dropping down clotheslines & double axe handles while Brock kept tossing him over announce tables & breaking pieces of it over his body. Brock was able to keep stopping Punk's momentum with one power hit after another focusing on his ribs & back to the point where he kept telling Punk to ""STAY DOWN!"" causing Punk to get desperate taking a page out of Mike Tyson's past & started building momentum with punches & kicks eventually taking Brock down & keeping him down with roundhouse kicks & the Savage Elbow before both men was able to counter each other's signature holds such as the G.T.S. into Kimora Lock into a triangle choke into a running powerbomb while later a F5 countered in a way we hadn't seen before with a chair came into play along with Paul Heyman constantly becoming a difference maker throughout the match. Michael Cole said it best, ""What an incredible fight"" while Shawn Michaels later echoed everyone's sentiments, ""C.M. Punk & Brock Lesnar...Thank You Very Much!""
SummerSlam

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps. Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up. This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.
SummerSlam

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD took control early on with standing moonsaults both in the ring & off the apron followed by his trademark twisting ledrop onto Del Rio laying on the barricade before Del Rio went on the offensive with his own suicide dive headbutt & various kicks to the head including an enziguri kick to the back of RVD's head on the apron. Both men continued to trade momentum with RVD going over & off the top rope with legdrops & sidekicks & rolling thunder while Del Rio delivered a tilt-a-wirl back breaker & double stomp to the back & was able to counter a rolling thunder into a backstabber along as they just went back & forth with RVD's leg scissors takeover & split leg moonsault followed by Del Rio's knock out kick & block to the frog splash. This was a good solid encounter between both men but I felt that their non-title match on SmackDown weeks earlier was a better encounter with the finish not coming off well.
Night Of Champions

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Natayla vs. Brie Bella vs. Naomi - With A.J. being outspoken about the ""Total Divas"" reality show, all of her challengers singled her out from the very beginning working her over & throwing her into the barricade taking her out of the match before it became ""every diva for herself"" with some highlights like Naomi's athleticism with a head scissors takeover & attempted high crossbody and Natayla executing a double sharpshooter while A.J. kept trying to steal the win off other's work & using the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" by keeping the other divas out of the ring while she worked on one individually. This was a decent match.
Night Of Champions

Cody Rhodes & Goldust vs. The Shield - The stipulations for this were high as both Cody & Dustin would be reinstated into WWE if they won but remain unemployed with Dusty Rhodes also losing his job in NXT if they lose while both Dusty & Dean Ambrose were in the corners of their teams. The Rhodes were very dominate in the early going as The Shield just couldn't get any momentum in their direction even when Dean tried to get involved leading to all 6 men facing off on the outside but The Shield was able to resort to their ""vintage"" tag team strategy of isolating one man & heavily working him over as each member of the Rhodes was put into the position throughout the match before we saw some offense that we normally don't see from either Cody or Goldust including the Alabama Slam, moonsault, and a twisting crossbody while Dusty was able to get ""funky like a monkey"" on Ambrose. This was definitely an emotional match seeing how this is the first time that all three Rhodes were involved together in a match & told the story perfectly of them fighting for a cause as Cody was hot, this was the most I've seen Goldust motivated compared to his time in WWE before this while The Shield were on their game as usual.
Battleground

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. John Cena - Cena came into this match wear an arm pad which Del Rio targeted right away with strikes & stretches & using ring environment to his advantage while Cena came back with some offense like catching Del Rio in mid-air with a dropkick & tornado DDT along with even coming off the top rope but did hurt himself with some of the moves he did as they did trade momentum back & forth with counters & reversals to submission attempts with Del Rio continuing to focus on the arm & Cena showcasing also superhuman strength with that arm. If you can get past what pretty much everyone knew what was going to happen going into this match which I admit I wasn't happy with, I will give this match credit in that they told a good story here focused around the previously injured arm.
Hell In A Cell

WWE Championship Hell In A Cell Match w/special referee Shawn Michaels: Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton - Both men were pretty even early with both executing different types of dropkicks & utilizing not just the cell but also the steel steps at ringside to their advantage before Orton was able to take advantage of using Bryan's momentum against him to keep the match at a slow & methodical pace showing a more aggressive side such as using headbutts & even dirty tactics while Bryan kept a fast pace executing his strikes from a running position & scoring offense off the second & top rope with a steel chair coming into play on more than one occasion for both men before things really broke down with Triple H kept having conflicting opinions about the way things were going with Shawn Michaels leading to all the relationships with Shawn & all three men coming to ahead...literally. Orton & Bryan haven't had a bad match against each other & this was no exception with the only negative thing being that after getting the same type of finishes for months between these two that didn't have a positive response to the point where it's public knowledge that cable companies gave refunds to the fans who demanded it out of disgust that we shouldn't have gotten that type of finish again with the only thing positive coming out of doing it that way being that & the follow up angle the next night on RAW being that it may lead up to a possible dream match at WrestleMania.
Hell In A Cell

Now I know that there isn't enough room to get every single quality match from the year but some of the choices were very questionable for this being a ""Best Of"" as certain matches were picked (Orton/Show, Del Rio/Dolph, RVD/Del Rio from Night Of Champions, 4 Way Divas) in favor of some that were better quality (Show/Del Rio from Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber, Punk/Jericho, RVD/Del Rio from Battleground) but we still got some of the best encounters from the year so overall this is no different than the previous years in that this is a collection for those who those who have enjoyed WWE this year but obviously are unable to watch/collect most of the PPV's.",1385510400,6,19572,4.478845615018212
