7875017,3,6304622732,"This is a strangely put-together DVD.  It consists of two separate approximately 46-minute programs which play continuously--what I mean by that is that the copy I got has no menu options to select which program or chapter you want to view.  (That's kind of a pain because it makes it difficult to get to the chapters you like best.)  That being said, don't expect anything too fancy with the actual content--segments consist of various models and B-movie actresses telling you about themselves and then dancing against a plain black background.  Julie Strain is your host, appearing between each segment.  There are some familiar faces here, including Stevie Conrad, Fantasia, and Lorissa McComas.  Programs include full nudity.  A warning--a girl named Bambi is advertised, but doesn't appear in either program.",1376697600,,813,5.255813953488372
7875018,1,6304622732,"When buying a DVD called 'Julie Strain's Bad Girls', there are a few things you would expect to be on the DVD: 1) Julie Strain for more than five minutes; 2) Women in sexy situations; 3) Sets ; 4) Oh, and how about girls being bad. This DVD unfortunately delivers none of those. Julie Strain only introduces the video and comes back between segments with apparently improvised lines (at least I would hope nobody could be this incompetent if they took the time to sit down and write). The segments consist of wannabe starlets telling us about themselves and then dancing, usually naked, but some are not. The dancing is poor and uninspired, but that is not necessarily the fault of the ladies since they are hardly given anything with which to work. The ladies are basically put in front of a camera to dance in front of a plain background while being videotaped by a cameraman who thinks a zoom lens is creative. This could have been done by anybody who has a garage and a videocamera. The only thing of note on this DVD is that one of the starlets is Lorissa Mccomas. If you want a much better deal, get the Brentwood 2 DVD set called 'Bachelor Party' which is four hours of strippers.",1104796800,6,1187,4.474654377880184
