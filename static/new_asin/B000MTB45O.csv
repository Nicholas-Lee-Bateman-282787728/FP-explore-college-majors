8171801,4,B000MTB45O,"This is possibly the best video done on the Korean War.
It was done by Ted Turner and presented by Kurt Duglas.
I gave it four stars as this is a good VHS tape to own.
It is a shame it was never recorded to DVD.
If you can still get a copy of this tape do so.",1235952000,,259,3.4827586206896552
