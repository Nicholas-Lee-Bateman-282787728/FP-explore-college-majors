8152084,1,B000JM7GWY,"I bought this movie at an American air force base in Illinois.  As Pamela says, the first half is travelogue and the second half is propaganda.  Like her, I was wondering what was going on during the travelogue.  Then a guy came on.  He was speaking German very fluently, standing at a podium addressing an audience.  A subtitle said he was David Irving, British historian.  He seemed to have awfully good command of the German language for a British guy.  After watching the movie, I googled his name.  Now everything makes sense.  He's a crackpot who was once a gifted historian, but who has earned the scorn of other historians for his twisted views.

That said, the eyewitness interviews with people who were there in Dresden were heartbreaking.  There is no doubt war is hell and there is no way to try to make it seem civilized or good.  But as I was listening to them ask how one human being could do this to another, I was thinking, ""You started it.""",1442102400,,958,4.505813953488372

They are going quickly. It is a very fine
effoert to correct some of the myths about
WWII that have clouded our society since.
WWII myths, still alive in the 21st Century?
You bet!",1211932800,,410,4.189873417721519
8152086,2,B000JM7GWY,"This movie is divided into two parts.  The first part contains footage of all the art works, histoic buildings, and such...done with a voice over that reminds one of old school films...the kind with spools of film that went on a clunky projector. Although it is interesting...I began to wonder if i had the right movie.  It sounded like a travel log.  I'm sure it was to show what was lost in the fires and how these blips were the last we will ever see of these works of art.
 The second half is war footage, eye witness testimony, and anti-British/ anti-American propaganda that is dated.  (More recent books reveal the flaws in these arguments that the British/American's were monsters,forcing the peaceful Germans bomb them, and that the German City wasn't part of the war effort...yada yada yada...)
One intereting thing that the film does show is the fire storm from the vantage point of the bombers. It was awful. And the eyewitness testimony is heartbreaking. No one should have to go through what they did.
The bombing of Dresden was horrible, on the same level as a war crime...but with both sides bombing each other's cities, I'm suprised more firestorms didn't occur.",1184630400,3,1179,4.788177339901478
