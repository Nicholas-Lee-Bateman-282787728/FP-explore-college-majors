So true in this case.  Sid, the son of a gangster, comes to a fork in the road, and chooses a path far from where he expected his life to take him.

This is a film about discovery and redemption, and well worth a watch.

3595702,5,B001G5KEL8,"This film offers a different take on growing up. Sure, many recognizable story elements are in place, but for me, this movie provided many different opportunities to relate, and appreciate, the growth and maturation of the characters.

I've watched this several times, a luxury towards film that has diminished over time. As I get older, my days have become more full and my values have changed; to want to watch a movie more than once strikes me as peculiar for a variety of reasons. Thus, I'm a bit reluctant to share details to a new viewer.

I will say this, purposefully dancing around details. There's a quality to the film that I can best describe as ""authenticity"". Yes, dramatic license is taken, and this _is_ a storybook tale, but if you're willing to walk with the film at its own pace, to hold back on assigning expectation or judgment, I think you may find that this movie will touch you.

I wish I could have a conversation with each of you that watches this. I cherish this movie in some ways, and sharing a story like this with others is a lot of fun for me.

3595705,5,B001G5KEL8,"The Drummer is a story about the power of individual determination. The story may not be the most original: guy is on the wrong track in life, goes through a transformation, and then his old life catches up with him and he has to choose between the two paradigmn. But the execution is just so damn good that it doesn't matter that the vehicle may a bit on the refurbished side.

One of the reasons that director Kenneth Bi is able to pull off this concept is the quality of his actors. When you're playing the part of the reformed-upstart in training it is easy to drift into the campy terrain of exasperating impertinence and incredulous reversal, but Jaycee Chan honestly constructs a believeable, consistent character.

For me, though, the narrative wasn't even my favorite part of the film. I really enjoyed the mood that pervaded the entire experience. This effect is heightened by the contrast between the bleak, industrial prologue and the verdant mountainside of the monestary. Once the story arrives at the drumming commune it really blossoms. Bi really lets you indulge in the gorgeous scenery of the Taiwanese countryside, and the scenes cataloging the lives of the drummers allow the viewer to unabashedly yen for the life that Chan has stumbled upon.

All of this lets the complex themes of the movie arise organically. I won't color your experience of the film too much, but I just thought that it was interesting that the hands which Bi nearly loses in the opening of the film are the key to his percussive redemption and his ability to choose between the two lives.",1274400000,3,1581,4.762773722627737
3595706,5,B001G5KEL8,"Do you like percussions? Are you interested in Chinese traditions? Would you like to see how Zen drummers devote every breath of their life to help the drum sound? Have you reached all your potential?  If you're interested in these themes, ""The Drummer"" will speak to you.

The story

""The Drummer"" confronts two societies: a powerful triad empire in Hong Kong and a community faithfully devoted to austerity and tradition.

Sid (Jaycee Chan) is a boy of a triad leader and also a modern drummer; he is a talent but haughty youngster who lives on the edge of danger. Sid defies triad authority and gets emotionally involved with the girlfriend of Stephen Ma (a top executive of the organization), who sentences a severe penalty for the disrespectful kid.  Sid's father (Kwan) and Stephen Ma, negotiate a punishment for the boy. Despite being in debt with Chief Ma, Kwan assumes a high risk and sends his son to Taiwan to save him from the terrible sentence.

Hidden in the mountains, Sid observes a practice session of Zen drummers. As a percussionist himself, Sid recognizes the high class performance of those consummated artists. In a display of arrogance, Sid promotes himself to join the group.  Despite the disagreement of some members, Lan Jie (the supervisor of the band) allows Sid to adhere the community, because she perceives with compassion a sad kid who is asking for help.

Once accepted, Sid undergoes a tough but beautiful process of transformation through Zen practices. The film sequences in the mountains of Taiwan are inspirational; the Director (Kenneth Bi) drives the audience to a unique journey, fulfilled with remarkable values of the Zen society; this passage reveals the physical and spiritual activities Zen drummers follow to help the drum sound. At the same time, in the contrasting world of triads, Kwan must face the consequences due the alternative plan he executed to protect his kid.

Several months later, the destiny moves Sid to Hong Kong, he is still in the process of redemption, and the circumstances force him to face the crossroad of his life: Take care of his father's business or to continue his inner journey through drumming.

The performers

The actors of The Drummer don't act, they are the personages. It is impressive the way they got involved in the characters.  In my opinion, their performances reach the zenith in the final sequence, which is quite difficult, because the actors express themselves with every resource they have, except with dialogues. For information about the cast & crew members, visit the drummer's website.

The artwork

The amalgamation of the soundtrack of Andre Matthias and cinematography of Sam Koa is truly exciting. The artwork reaches the summit in the final sequence with the outstanding performance of the U Theater troup.

Chinese's insights.

The Drummer enlightens many Chinese thoughts, I'd like to comment two of them:

""We practice Kung Fu, no to conquer others, but to conquer ourselves"". The traditional practice of Kung Fu (work & dedication) doesn't include a ranking system to assign grades of expertise to its practitioners. In this discipline, students start as beginners and -no matter how long they train- they will always consider themselves as beginners. To overcome the lack of external recognition, the pupils of Kung Fu track their progress in terms of the internal benefits they receive, for instance: health, emotional stability and vitality. That means, the baseline of their development is their own performance, that's why their goal is: to ""conquer themselves""

""Drumming without drumming"".  An interpretation of that phrase goes beyond the acoustic level. It can be identify three stages  in drumming process, a) the drummer learns the methods to conquer the instrument, b) when the drummer dominates the techniques, the drum becomes his extension; at this point the artist starts to express his emotions trough the instrument, and c) the drummer ""forgets"" his techniques, loses his ego and becomes one with the drum, that's when the musician doesn't play with his hands; his heart beats along with the drum, so, at this phase the artist: ""drums without drumming"".",1265328000,21,4178,5.1071953010279
3595707,4,B001G5KEL8,"(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)

The Drummer tells the story of a young man on the run from organized crime who ends up hiding out by joining a bunch of hippies at their drum circle commune.

Well, at least that's what we'd call it if everyone were white, but since they're Chinese it's all mystical and wonderful and, at least somewhat to my surprise, makes for a pretty darn good movie.

The story centers around Sid, played by American actor Jaycee Chan, son of a certain other famous Chan. He looks rather like his father, especially in the face.

Sid is something of a good-for-nothing young man. He's a constant embarrassment to his father, a local crime lord. This embarrassment becomes especially acute when Sid starts sleeping with Carmen, the girlfriend/concubine of a rival crime lord. Things get ugly when the rival finds out about this and demands Sid's hands as payment. Sid's father instead exiles his son to Taiwan.

It's in Taiwan that he finds a group of taiko drummers and falls in love with what they do. He also falls in love with a rather pretty young drummer, but that's incidental.

The drummers live in a temple-like area where Sid winds up getting training that includes more contradictory koans than an entire Zen monastery. He also clearly hasn't seen any movies or he'd realized he's getting the Miyagi treatment with a bunch of what he has to do during training (you know, chop vegetables so that he builds arm strength and the like).

The plot is pretty cliche and you can basically predict from start to finish exactly where it's going to go. It is, however, very well-done cliche, with great performances all around, and moments of great wonder and beauty, even beyond the incredible scenery of Taiwan. There's a spectacular small-scale scene where Sid plays a solo concert for his father that can't help but touch the heart of anyone who has been on either end of the situation the two find themselves in at that point.

All in all this is a fine movie. I've never seen any of Kenneth Bi's other movies, but merely on the strength of this one, I want to seek out more.

The film is unrrated, but suitable for pretty much all audiences. There's a bit of strong language and some violence, but nothing too far beyond the PG rating.

Extras include the usual trailers for other Film Movement movies and a special ""making of"" featurette.

-- The Short Subject --

The short subject on this disc for this month is ""Love and War"", a strange little Swedish opera starting puppets. The plot is pretty basic: bunny meets bear, bear doesn't eat bunny, they fall in love, bear goes off to war.

Nothing special plot-wise, but the majesty is in the details. This is a lovely film to look at and the music and singing are great. I defy anyone to not get at least a little choked up at the end (it is opera, after all). It's a great little film and a wonderful addition to the disc!",1263168000,3,2938,4.583969465648855
3595708,5,B001G5KEL8,"Zhan Gu (The Drummer)

This film was shot in the mountains outside Taitung, on the east coast of Taiwan. The Drummer is a beautiful film with an excellent story.

Sid (played by Jaycee Chan yes Jackie Chan's son), the son of a Triad gang leader, is a troubled young man. He's a drummer playing in Clubs. He is full of rage, disrespect and admiration for his father (Kwan played by Tony Leung Ka Fai). Sid insults his father's business partner (Stephen Ma played Kenneth Tsang) who then asks for Sid's hands to be delivered, as retribution. Sid is whisked off to Taiwan with his uncle (Ah Chiu played by Roy Cheung)  and the story then gains momentum.

Sid decides he wants to join a drumming group. The group practices Zen drumming, mediation and kung fu. Lan Jie played by Ruo-yu Liu, and Sifu played by Chih-chun Huang are real life drummers, from U Theatre in China, as are the rest of their troupe. Sid also meets a young woman there who is very determined and full of fire (Hong Dou played by Angelica Lee). Through a series of events, young Sid eventually is renamed Tao by the Master or Sifu. He undergoes transformation and maturation in this intriguing film.

Kenneth Bi (Rice Rhapsody/Hainan ji fan) wrote and directed this well-researched and well-executed film. The Drummer is a ""must see"" film, and brings to light that this is what film making is all about. One perk to the DVD is the featurette: The Making of the Drummer. This makes this film preferable on DVD rather than the theatre; you'll really get a stronger feeling for what went into making this extraordinary film.",1250467200,2,1589,4.640569395017794

3595801,5,B001G5KEL8,"Music can have a profound impact on how we see and experience our world, whether we learn to play it or learn to listen to it. This effect is hard to describe, it is like explaining how an epiphany feels. It is better to witness this effect first hand, of course if that can't be done, it can be shown through story telling. This is what the movie The Drummer does, it shows you how music effected a young man.
 The main character, Sid, is the son of a Hong Kong gangster, Kwan, whose hot tempered disposition ruined his marriage driving away Sid's mother. This left him and his sister Sina to grow up with their father's extreme moods. To cope with the loss of his mother Sid turns to drumming. However, Sid also acts out, much like his father and eventually gets his father into trouble with a more powerful member of the Hong Kong underworld. To protect his son Kwan sends Sid away to hide in Taiwan, not Taipei, the metropolis capital of the island, but out in the countryside. While staying there under the watchful eye of an older member of his father's gang, Ah Chiu, Sid discovers in the hills behind his house a group of drummers who practice Zen drumming. While it is Sids' love of drumming that motivates him to join the group, the presence of a firery young woman, Hong Dou, in the troupe doesn't hurt.
 Like Zen, the style of drumming portrayed in the film originally comes from China, but both were adopted by Japan. Many in the west are familiar with the large drums beaten upon with thick wooden sticks popularized by troupes such as Kodo, from Japan. To play such instruments takes a different kind of training, it is a full body work out, not counting on the mental training. To be apart of such a group, in the traditional sense, means a high level of commitment and discipline, things that Sid lacks.
 Sid is able to join these drummers and goes through a maturation process that helps him cross over into adulthood. This process is not without setbacks as Sid adjusts to the different lifestyle practiced by these monk like performers. He also has difficultly communicating to Hong Dou who he is as a person, which makes for some tension. He has to leave behind his Hong Kong ego and love of wealth and freedom and become a drummer.
 The performances in this movie are wonderful and real. Sid is played by Jaycee Chan who clearly shows his character go from cocky brat to intensely focused young man. Tony Leung Ka Fai plays Kwan and brilliantly shows the aggressive gangster who hides away a much softer side and deeper understanding of his faults and how they have effected his children. The actresses in this movie do a top job of being fierce fighters for their place in the world and defenders of the weak. It is the women who fill the strongest roles. Sids' sister, Sina, played by Josie Ho, is a veterinarian and stands up to her fathers wild anger to protect her brother and her choice of husband, never backing down. Hong Dou, played by Angelica Lee, is a disciplined young women with no fear, proven when she attacks Sid in a market area for being a bully. While the troupe is lead by a master drummer, it's run by a woman named Lan Jie, played by Liu Ruo-yu, who is  pure example of Zen clam and determination. She is motherly to young Sid, but willing to put him in his place if needed.
 The movie is filled with memorable scenes and beautiful camera work. One of the most touching scenes is when Sid, who wants to perform for his father, plays his drums outside the walls of the prison his father is locked away in. There are picturesque shots of the Taiwanese countryside were the drummers practice. These scenes are shot in a way to suggest a protected area, not just the environment, but the art that is practiced there. Kenneth Bi seems to be saying there must be room in our lives for scared places and scared arts. Having always possessed a love for this style of drumming, because of its' highly meditative and intense nature, I was immediately interested in watching this movie. I was pleased to be given more than just a drum-line performance with some cheesy `boy gets girl after learning to drum' story. I was pleased to see that Kenneth Bi's love of drumming and Zen go much deeper.",1360454400,,4228,4.498697916666667

3595804,4,B001G5KEL8,"SHORT REVIEW:

If you're into drum solos and all that - this is NOT a movie for that sort of thing. The drumming is really just a bonus in the story - it's not the story. It's really a story of personal growth and development more than anything else as this guy learns to fit in and learns this art and the lifestyle of the group - and when they do perform it's easy to appreciate the physical demands and talent and precision and dedication.

So, clear your mind of expectations and let the movie take you where it will - it's a good experience.  I enjoyed this a lot.

**************************
MORE DETAILED REVIEW:

After an evening playing drums in a bar band, a Hong Kong  gang leader's spoiled punk son (Sid) gets in bed with a rival mobster's girl (Carmen) -- choosing her BECAUSE she belongs to the rival as much as because she is desirable - and he gets caught.

Instead of taking Sids life, the offended mob boss (Stephen Ma) lets him go, but contacts Sids father (Kwan), and demands only Sids hands (instead of his life) as the price to avoid war and restore honor.

Kwan is a brutal father to both his children, but he does love them.  Until he can figure out what to do about the situation, he sends his trusted right-hand man (Chiu) off to hide and protect Sid until further notice. And Chiu takes Sid to a remote mountain area (in Taiwan) - which is beautiful really.

While there, Sid hears a drumming sound coming from the mountains and wanders off to see what it is.  He finds a group of people performing on these large kettle type drums. They are the Zen Drummers.  He is emotionally moved and decides he wants to join.  They give him a tryout and then the drumming group leader (Lan Jie) interviews him to find out his real interest in joining the group.  [Pay attention to what Sid says.]  She lets him join.

But being part of the group means living in the remote area (they visit their families in the city once a month).  They grow their own food and are basically self-sufficient.  They workout hard and practice martial arts - ""not to have power over others, but to have power over themselves.""  Everybody does chores to pitch in.  Sid has to learn to conform, to be responsible, to consider others before himself, to fit in, etc.  His body needs to be strengthened and trained as well (again, their physical training is impressive!)  YOU learn to appreciate all that goes into the drumming performances.  Every movement and stance has meaning and intent.

The ""master"" teaches them how to drum, ""Lan Jie"" teaches how NOT to drum.  ie  How to understand yourself.  (Remember, he drums to escape and to vent, not to understand himself.)

It's very interesting and the performances are remarkable.  The end is a little unclear but it doesn't really matter.  The movie isn't about drumming - it's about the boy Sid, the zen drumming is just a part of him now. The Zen Drumming performances are like gifts as you see them throughout the movie, as is what you might learn as you go along as well.  All in all this was a really wonderful movie and I'm glad for the experience.  I hope you will be too.

**SIDE NOTE:
When they are in the mountains where they live and practice, there is 1 guy who rings this huge gong to mark time of day I think.  It only happens a few times during the movie, but I just LOVE the resonance it gives off - even through my dinky little pc pod speaker.  Let yourself feel/experience that when it happens.  It's great!

**BONUS:
Here is a YOUTUBE link that will give you an idea of the Zen Drumming - these are the people in the film really, sound quality isn't great but you get the idea [...]",1345507200,,3646,4.42042042042042
3595805,5,B001G5KEL8,"The drumming, the message, the power of the message and the acting were amazing. The movie reminds me that when a person finds the right vehicle of transformation they can truly evolve.",1341619200,,185,4.8125
3595806,5,B001G5KEL8,"The story of a defiant young man, treading a dangerous path, THE DRUMMER is an all-round excellent film.

PLOT: A coming-of-age story about Sid Kwan, the son of a Hong Kong Triad boss, who restlessly seeks fulfilment by challenging his violent father when he has an affair with the mistress of his father's greatest rival, Stephen Ma. Sid must escape retribution by hiding out in Taiwan, where he comes into contact with a group of Zen drummers. Long ago, Sid's mother, a nightclub singer, had an affair with a drummer. One day they disappeared and Sid provoked his father by becoming a drummer. But the Zen drummers Sid meets take him on an inner journey that has the potential to transform his life...until his father's heritage forces him to make a difficult choice.

SETTING: The juxtaposition of the frenetic lifestyle of modern Hong Kong with the peace and tranquillity of the mountain sanctuary of the Zen drummers reflects a universal struggle: how does modern man find his true spiritual self in a world where violence, sex and materialism are a constant temptation?  Beautifully filmed, the settings add to the film's power.

CHARACTERISATIONS & ACTING: Like his brilliant actor father Jackie, young Jaycee Chan is a superb actor. His portrayal of the complexities of Sid's life and choices were both subtle and intense. Chan captured Sid's love/hate relationship with his gangster father perfectly. Tony Leung Ka Fai (who we first saw in THE LOVER) was powerful and impressive as the tormented Triad boss Kwan. Josie Ho, as Sid's tough sister Sina, and Roy Cheung as Sid's guard Ah Chiu when he was sent into hiding in Taiwan to escape Ma's wrath, both gave forceful performances. Chan and Ho's portrayal of the siblings Sid and Sina, and their interpretation of the multifaceted relationship with their father, added another complex layer to the movie.

MUSIC: Andre Matthias's original soundtrack using Hong Kong born cellist Trey Lee as the cello soloist on the original score, deepened the tension without being overpowering.  The drumming performances by the U Theatre group of Taiwan were breath-taking in their power and serenity.

In conclusion, Kenneth Bi's THE DRUMMER is a movie that inspires as much as it entertains. A unique and interesting night's viewing that I highly recommend.",1332547200,,2306,5.052631578947368
3595807,2,B001G5KEL8,This movie just didn't move me like it did others. I thought it was boring and to long. It took me 2 sittings to finish it. I had high hopes for this movie hearing all the good reviews and I really wanted to see it because Jackie Chan's son was in it but unlike his father he has no screen presence. I think that it wasn't for Jaycee being Jackie's son I don't think this movie would have gotten such rave reviews. If I could I would have gave it 2 and a half stars.
