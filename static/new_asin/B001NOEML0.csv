8327534,4,B001NOEML0,"I originally got to see these cartoons on Australia's SBS channel, and found them very funny, in a bad-taste kind of way. Revisiting this material, some of it is very clever and some is the reverse.

I was glad that this DVD arrived promptly and in good condition.",1329696000,,420,4.767123287671233
