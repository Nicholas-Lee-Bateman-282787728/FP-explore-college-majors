3756558,5,B001PR0XZO,"Just saw this in a theatre with only two other people in the audience.  I am still crying, it touched me so.

I am a classically trained pianist who always was and still only am in my element when I'm sitting on a piano bench facing the 88s.  However, I was advised at an early age to ""do something that will earn you money"", and I didn't follow my heart.  Perhaps this is why this film touched me so much, but it was a moving tribute to Michael Bennett and the entire group of people involved in this magical musical.

Bravo.",1247011200,3,526,4.1683168316831685
3756559,5,B001PR0XZO,"If&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-on-Wire/dp/B001E5FYS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man on Wire</a>&nbsp;was the Academy Award winner for 2008's best documentary, then ""Every Little Step"" better be a shoo-in for 2009.  We saw these two films back-to-back this past weekend and by my estimation, Step's co-directors Adam Del Deo and James D. Stern have created a more compelling film-going experience.

Art and life are intertwined here many times over - Michael Bennett's interviews of real chorus line dancers spawned the initial incarnation of the play, which grew quickly into a Broadway colossus winning a Tony for Bennett and ascending him to a Broadway pantheon reserved for its great heroes.  Indeed, in this film Bennett is discussed in reverential tones.  There are compelling, fascinating videos and interviews of Bennett discussing the creative process of putting 'A Chorus Line' Together.  Most notably, the movie starts and ends with audio tapes of the original 12-hour session recorded by Bennett. In the world of theater, that's almost a sacred document.

With ""Every Little Step,"" art and life get further intertwined - just as the original play pulled its stories from real dancers, the movie bookends that by pulling together the real stories behind the casting of the revival.  It helps that some of the original players are here - co-casting director Bob Avian was a partner of Bennett's from the original production; and Baayork Lee - who does the choreography in the re-do - was not only 'Connie' in the original, she was also the inspiration of the Connie character. It's her voice, her story on Bennett's tape.

Standouts here include: Broadway royalty Charlotte d'Amboise (there's some great footage of her with her Dad, ballet legend Jaques d'Amboise) who wins the role of Cassie that was pioneered by Donna McKechnie; Yuka Takara, who wins the role of Connie despite some initial hesitancy from Lee; Rachelle Rak, compelling in _not_ getting a role (she's wonderfully articulate in describing her desperation at reaching for something that she can't remember when she asked to recreate ""what you did here eight months ago""); and - most notably - Jason Tam, whose audition for the seminal role of Paul has become the stuff of Broadway legend.  You'll see why here in the film's best passage.  Watching Avian and his team react to Tam, it's clear that they're of the belief that spirit of Bennett has entered the room.",1245196800,8,2490,5.329081632653061
3756560,4,B001PR0XZO,"This is a fun, enjoyable film about the casting for the 2006 revival of THE CHORUS LINE. With lots of clips and references to the original 1975, this almost mirrors the musical itself in following the audition process in discovering who would play the famous roles from the original. For the most part this works, though the film drags from time to time. After a time, hearing one person after another sing the same song others are also singing begins to lag a bit every few minutes. Watching a film about the casting of A CHORUS LINE is simply not a replacement for A CHORUS LINE. There are certainly a number of things to like and enjoy, but the film does not make for consistently great entertainment.

My favorite parts are those that chronicle the original production. A few cast members from the original show are interviewed and some archival footage is shown. As is well known, the original play was partially written based on tapes that director Michael Bennett made interviewing potential cast members. We hear some of those and we see how those fed into the final stage play. Oddly, arguably the best known person from the original play is not interviewed nor is she even mentioned by name. That would be Kelly Bishop, who won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in 1976 as Sheila. Thanks to her role as Emily Gilmore (Lorelai's mother) on THE GILMORE GIRL, she is far and away the best known performer outside New York from the original show. It is hard to understand why she wasn't mentioned even once. We do see her very, very briefly in a couple of archival footage and we see her photo when they mention the original Sheila.

Much of the film plays much like a reality show, not too much different than a reality show. You have fun trying to figure who is going to get what part, most of the winners being pretty obvious. I was able to guess correctly all but two. Frankly, I did not find most of the film riveting, though it was never bad.

I'm going to be honest: I think most of the other reviewers are wildly overrating this film. There is simply no way in the world it is a five star film. I'm not confident that it is a four star one. I seriously considered giving it three stars and if I could give it three and a half, I would have. I don't want to use the argument from authority, but this movie is not getting all that great reviews from professional reviewers either. My prediction is that as more potential reviewers see this, the rating will come down sharply. Like I said, my four star rating might actually be a bit generous.",1244678400,3,2574,4.46072186836518
3756561,5,B001PR0XZO,"My husband surprised me tonight by taking me to see this very special movie; one he knew I would love, and he would like not so much.  EVERY LITTLE STEP is the story of the Broadway smash hit A CHORUS LINE.  While EVERY LITTLE STEP takes you from the open call to the final casting and opening night of the 2006 revival of A CHORUS LINE, it also contains audio, video, and history from the original, ground breaking, 1975 production.

A CHORUS LINE is a Broadway show about dancers auditioning for a spot in the chorus of a Broadway show.  EVERY LITTLE STEP is a documentary that chronicles the audition process of dancers auditioning for this show about dancers who are auditioning for a show.  Whew!  But both EVERY LITTLE STEP and A CHOURS LINE are also about the love of dance, the love of performing, and what it means to be a dancer.  People who dance do so because they MUST; it is the only way they can be themselves.  The audition process painstakingly documented in EVERY LITTLE STEP is very honest, personal, and organic; it is the same process created by Michael Bennett for the original A CHORUS LINE production.  Mr. Bennett wanted to capture the hearts and souls of dancers; to truly portray who they are and why they dance.  It is an emotional, revealing, sometimes gut-wrenching, and often joyous process, and one that can be extremely moving.

The music is as memorable and timeless as always, the dancing is quite simply outstanding, and the choreography is classic and brilliant.  A CHORUS LINE is a show that means so much to so many, and EVERY LITTLE STEP is a wonderful, poignant tribute.

I cried throughout much of this film, it so touched my heart.  Of course, I, myself, am a dancer...I have auditioned for countless musicals over the years, and performed in ~40.  EVERY LITTLE STEP brings the realities and the dedication of performers everywhere out into the open where the general public can get a glimpse ""behind the scenes.""  EVERY LITTLE STEP beautifully shows the world what we do for love.",1244246400,3,2024,4.659154929577465
3756562,5,B001PR0XZO,"I awaited this film and, as one of the hundreds of very lucky ex-dancers who once had the thrill of working ""ACL"", though a long time ago, this brought back so very much of a life almost forgotten by having left to ""grow up"" and enter the real world.  A Chorus Line was the pinnacle of a career for many of us who had the honor and distinction to be a part of it, no matter how long ago.  Just as the show was like no other, so this film is absolutely like no other documentary that I have seen.  It is real, it is moving, it is genuine life, whether one has ever danced, never danced but wanted to, or never even considered dancing.  The film highlights the universal thirst of youth and beyond for all who have ever had a dream no matter the profession, industry, or passion.  It reflects the original show itself without repeating it.  Thanks Michael and Bob for giving the show--and by extension this film--to all who have ever dreamed a dream.  And a special thanks as well to the original Connie, the reliable Ms. B. Lee for doing your part to keep this dream alive for so many who have followed us.",1242604800,35,1105,4.258373205741627
3756563,5,B001PR0XZO,"""Every Little Step"" is a terrific movie. I've already seen it twice in the theater and I'm looking forward to a DVD ASAP :-D

A documentary about dancers auditioning for the revival of the musical about dancers auditioning for a musical?...it sounds insular but it's not. There is a universal appeal in following the hopeful young performers who aspire against tough odds and thousands of other dancers to land a role in A Chorus Line.

I'm a sucker for competition-type stories, and I remember seeing A Chorus Line on Broadway, so I found it fascinating to see how it all began and follow the intense, complex process of bringing a production to life.

You don't have to love musicals or dancing to enjoy this documentary. But if you do, you'll probably find it entertaining, moving, and more suspenseful than many so-called thrillers.",1242604800,17,836,4.873239436619718
3756564,5,B001PR0XZO,"About half way through this film I wondered to myself if the audience would clap when it was over. They did, and it was a spontaneous and well-deserved conclusion. I'm betting Every Little Step will earn awards for Best Documentary of the year. The film begins as a retrospective about the original Broadway musical A Chorus Line, which debuted in 1975 and after 6,137 performances became the longest-running musical ever. Archival material and interviews with members of the original production take you back thirty years to the show's simple premise, which centered on the deeply human stories of seventeen performers. The documentary then turns to the 2006 Broadway revival of the original musical, and takes you backstage to follow the stories of the dancers who auditioned for the fifteen or so spots. It begins with an open call that drew 3,000 artists, and proceeds through several call backs until the cast is finalized. Many are called but only a tiny few are chosen for the coveted opportunity.",1242000000,41,1004,5.017964071856287

3756638,4,B001PR0XZO,"If you are a fan of musical theatre in general or even just A Chorus Line in particular, this documentary is a must-see. It flips back and forth between looking at the original creation and staging of the show, and the audition process for the 2006 Broadway revival. Lots of wonderful interviews from old and new cast members, and of course great clips from different stage productions. The movie adaption of this groundbreaking show was simply awful---this documentary will erase all that from memory and bring the magnificent original stage show front and center.

I was already pretty familiar with the backstory of the show's beginnings with choreographer Michael Bennett, so I most enjoyed the in-depth look at the revival audition part of this film. Dancers lined up in the rain for hours, waiting to see if they can survive the first cut (after performing just one double-pirouette!). Pass the dance cuts, then you have to prove you've got the singing voice for the part. Dance yes, voice yes---now you need to act. ""100 nos to 1 yes,"" as one person says of the life of a Broadway dancer. When the final callbacks are finished, you'll despair or celebrate along with them.

One star off for some minor reasons: The filmmakers chose to focus on just a couple of roles in the revival audition process, and I would have loved to get even a small glimpse of the finalists for some other critical parts. The archival footage from the original Broadway production could have been expanded, with perhaps some comparison between those dancers and the revival wannabes. I definitely would have loved to see an extended ""director's cut"" with as much dancing, singing, and discussion as they had on hand!",1444003200,3,1700,4.858620689655172

I'd seen the documentary  earlier but wanted a copy, largely because Jason Tam, who made the panel of auditioners weep, landed the role of Paul San Marco in the revival. Saw him and chatted with him after the performance -- and he's a Hawaii boy, so there was the added element of pride that a local has made an impact on Broadway.

3756774,5,B001PR0XZO,"I saw ""A Chorus Line"" 11 times on Broadway during its original run. I had strong opinions on Donna McKechnie versus Anne Reinking. I knew every word and every step - could do entire dance sequences without stopping for a drink of water. ""What I Did For Love"" WAS (is?) my anthem.

As far as I know - no filming of the original show was made.
The movie of ""A Chorus Line"" (with Michael Douglas et al) was so awful that I wanted to picket theaters that screened it and carry a sign that said ""DANGER: Do Not Enter or you will never know that this story is really a masterpiece. REALLY."" It was like seeing the Mona Lisa painted by a 3rd grader on black velvet: not the real thing.

""Every Little Step"" tells the story of casting the revival of ""A Chorus Line"". It does a superb job of taking me back there - back to where I was hopeful, emotional, committed and limber.
It doesn't cheat or exaggerate: it doesn't have to. The truth of the story shines through. The performers are fantastic both when they are performing in auditions, and when they are not. The plot lines build naturally with all the inherent drama and uncertainty that IS the lives of these performers. The viewer involvement is as deep and complete as it was with the original show: we find favorites, yet love them all and wish they could all get the part, we tense up and time our breathing to that of the talent who are strutting their stuff over and over and over again.

It is a trip back in time with pretty photography, no editing room pyrotechnics (a la ""Chicago"", the film), great sound and amazing people who fill your laptop, HD TV, and/or soul.

If you never saw the original show, or the revival, I am sorry. But luckily for all of us, ""Every Little Step"" is a viable, satisfying and memorable alternative.",1318377600,13,1786,4.386706948640484

3756778,5,B001PR0XZO,"It is a fascinating documentary, not only for a in depth glimps of a major musical on Broadway's casting process, also a great perspective from those who must make the decision.

Show biz is so very subjective.  Those who made the callbacks are all talented performers.  But to cast for specific roles, the winners and losers become more and more obvious gearing towards the final callback.

I thought, with all the talent on Broadway, it must be hard to pick the right persons.  Wrong.  I viewed the DVD for the first time and was able to choose the ones being casted from the final callback scenes before the final cast was revealed.  How?  By knowing what each role is all about and by seeing the intercutting footage of each finalist doing the same dance routine/song/dialogue for the same role he/she was competing.  Seeing it from the decision maker's point of view, the chosen ones became very obvious.

SPOILER ALERT, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO GOT IT, STOP READING

Tyce was a great dancer/singer but he's too arrogant to be ""Mike"", a decent and easy going young man.

Jason Tam was no doubt the choice for ""Paul"".  I viewed his monologue (that made the production team cry) twice and both times I weeped, too.  The most amazing thing is that he snapped out character as soon as he left the audition room!  I found out later that his upbring was very unlike the character Paul's.  I don't know how he could bring such wrechedness and deep emotion out into the open to be Paul.....amazing.

Chryssie Whitehead was absolutely adorable as ""Christine"".  Her spunk and cute face were a leathal combination.  She reminds me of Sandra Bullock.  I wonder why Ms Whitehead wasn't on many feature film casting agents' top list for comedy or rom com?

Rachelle and Deidre were both fiesty performers.  It was too bad that Rachelle got into a wistful mindset before performing Shiela for the final cutback.  Seeing Deidre's interpretation of Shiela right after Rachelle's put any doubt to rest because Deidre was Shiela.  By the way, Deidre reminds me of Michelle Obama, assured, physically strong, and intellegent.

Jessica Lee was a bit young to be Val during the earlier callbacks.  I thought she'd be a great Maggie, her being so young and a bit unsure.  However, her final callback's performance of Val was terrific.  She's easily the best dancer in the lineup but she's also convincing as a flirty and no nonsense Val.

All in all, A Chorus Line is one of my all time favorite musicals.  I adore almost all of the songs and underscore in it.  I even like the movie version!  Long live A Chorus Line and wish for more rivivals to come!",1285113600,5,2640,4.659436008676789

It gives you just enough flavor of the complete show that even if you have no idea what the show is about, you will enjoy it.

The backbone of the movie is the playing of the original tape recording of the 12 hour marathon in a Manhattan warehouse that gave birth to A Chorus Line. When you hear the voices tell their own stories and then see those actual words in the script and songs, it gives you goose bumps.

Whether or not you have ever seen a musical, whether in high school, dinner theater or on Broadway, you will thoroughly enjoy this 90 minutes. What's even better is the commentary track that includes Marvin Hamlisch, the composer, and the producers of the film that gives some of the history of the show as well as how they got different shots in the film, i.e. camera placement, etc.

Highly recommend. Must warn there are two F-words spoken. They are part of the actual script in Val's Dance 10, Looks 3, number, where she says, I never saw The Red Shoes, I don't care a F... about The Red Shoes, and later at the end Val also says after she doesn't make The Rockettes, F... the Rockettes.

And here I sit, looking forward to sharing this great experience, and seeing women only, as if there are no men in the show. Really disappointing, a missed chance! Must I watch the deleted scenes? Well, I gave up.",1264636800,3,595,4.274336283185841
3756822,4,B001PR0XZO,"The Bottom Line:

A film about the casting of A Chorus Line revival that understands the central theme of the play better than Richard Attenborough's 1985 film does, Every Little Step is an engrossing documentary about aspiring actors/dancers that will interest you regardless of whether you have any familiarity with the story (though it certainly helps) and one I highly recommend.

3756823,3,B001PR0XZO,"As someone who has taught A Chorus Line and read several books or accounts about it's inception, this DVD was quite disappointing.  They relied heavily on telling the story of the inception of the original A Chorus Line, which I would argue is fairly well known (at least through theatre circles anyway).  Several people I know saw it in the theatres and said it was SO great, truly one of the best documentaries of the year, yet I thought it _dragged_.  They left out how several key characters were cast (Morales anyone?) and there were no extras on the DVD that examined the middling success of this revival or updates from the cast of the current or previous incarnations.  It was fun to see Tyce Diorio, now famous for his ""cancer dance"" on SYTYCD to be so blantantly egocentric to the point where he lost the part, but that was about the only thing I found exciting.",1262476800,2,872,4.535031847133758
3756854,5,B001PR0XZO,"I was never lucky enough to catch ""Chorus Line"" on the stage and found the movie so-so.  This docu certainly changed my perception of the essence of what Chorus Line was conveying to its audience and maybe with me being an ardent, almost fanatical, fan of the dance series 'So You Think You Can Dance' I've come to appreciate just how very hard these dancers have to work to develop their talent for their place in the sun.  I was fascinated how the stage play came about ie. as a result of true life stories of aspiring dancers, inserts that were taken from taped interviews over a period of 24 hours and around these song and dance numbers were formulated and brought to the stage.  Moving 3 decades on, the movie goes through the trauma (eight months of call backs)of auditioning and a further 8 months to bring it a revival back to Broadway . . . what tenacity that must take !

Most touching scene is the auditioning scene with the vulnerable youth bringing to tears the entire auditioning audience when he described how his debut stage appearance as a drag artist first shocked his attending-the-show parents, with his father, after the show, telling the producer of the show ""to look after my son"" - the very first acceptance of him as such.

3756864,4,B001PR0XZO,"For the legions of theater lovers who treasure A CHORUS LINE  this informative and fascinating little film will bring memories and tears and satisfaction.  The story behind the film is a documentary of sorts that examines the remake of the now nearly  thirty-five year old Broadway sensation of a show that was created by Michael Bennett from a recorded conversation with 'gypsies' (a common term for those who work the chorus line).  The road from conception to completion for the original show is mirrored by the struggles to cast this re-staging.  We are privileged to observe scores of talented dancer/singers as they try to satisfy the team that will have the final say in who is selected for the production.  Those familiar with the original cast as well as the movie version or one of the many traveling troupes that have keep this show alive will make their own decisions about who is best for each of the roles.  This provides a very immediate replay of the original idea, watching the reactions of each of the people who audition, learning about their own lives, and the importance that appearing in this production means to each.  They take what could have been an insider's story and make it viable - which most certainly adds to the joy of seeing and hearing bits and pieces of one of the best shows Broadway ever produced. There is a lot of humor here, some very gut wrenching drama (as we see one of the dancers recreate Paul's monologue), and load of fine memories.

What I was hoping for in this video was the story of the dancers auditioning for the revival, which was definitely there.  However, there was much more archival material and personal interviews than I had expected, to the detriment of documenting the audition process.  I was disappointed that we followed auditions for only a handful of the characters.  In addition, I found that in many cases the dancers' stories were relatively superficial and I found it difficult to get emotionally involved with them and cheer for my favorites (although the candidates for Sheila and Cassie were notable exceptions).  I enjoyed the film but toward the end I was forwarding through the interviews to find what I really wanted, which was the personal stories of the dancers.  One unexpected bonus was getting to know the present-day Baayork Lee (and finding out that she is delightful).  It would have been nice if the film had included more ""where are they now?"" features about the original cast members.

This is a great DVD in which you learn a lot about what went into casting the recent revival of ""A Chorus Line"" and you learn almost as much about the original production back in the Seventies.  Alternately inspiring and heartbreaking, ""Every Little Step"" has more genuine human drama than the best of scripted television or the reality shows.  In fact, it is a disservice to ""ELS"" and the theater community at large to even mention ""reality shows"" in the same sentence with this program.

The feature film is fascinating, and you should also re-watch it with the commentary track to hear and learn even more.

When auditioner Nikki Snelson (who didn't get cast for the Broadway revival but was cast in the national tour) watches from the wings as fellow auditioner Jessica Lee dances circles around everyone else, you can see the resignation (and subtle look of respect) on Snelson's face.  It's real life, folks, and much more interesting and relevant than ""those other shows"".

3756870,5,B001PR0XZO,"I, too, saw this movie in the theatre and was overwhelmed, both by the story of the dancers auditioning for the revival as well as the archival material & interviews with the cast & creators of the original.  I saw ACL on Broadway in 1976 and it helped inspire me to pursue a career as an actor and to take years of dance class.  Although no longer a performer, I love those who are and this film is a paean to anyone who dreams of earning a living doing the one thing they love most.  ACL has always had a special place in my heart (the movie version notwithstanding) and ""Every Little Step"" was like a giant bouquet of roses laid at the feet of an adored diva.  I wept at the loss of Michael Bennett and so many others, reveled in the joy of knowing that as long as ACL is being performed they will live on, and was on the edge of my seat waiting to learn which dancers made the final cut.  I could not have loved this film more.  A final note: my 15-year-old niece attends Pebblebrook, a performing arts school in Atlanta, and she, too, dreams of becoming an actress.  I have already sent her the DVD as I believe it should be required viewing for every aspiring performer.  Just like ACL, ""Every Little Step"" pulls no punches in its portrayal of the difficult road traveled by those hoping for success on the stage.  It drives home the concept that if one can be happy doing anything other than performing, one should not choose it as a career.",1255996800,,1448,4.274725274725275
3756871,5,B001PR0XZO,"After wiping the tears away at the end of the film, my first thought was, ""This helps erase the memory of the awful film Of A Chorus Line"". Having seen the show a number of times before the film adaptation, I was ready for a permanent homage to my favorite of all Broadway shows. I could have shot the director after seeing his misinterpretation of the original show. Every Little Step is even better than a film of the show could be for those of us who love it.

We are given a look into the genesis of Michael Bennett's concept. I did not know how groundbreaking A Chorus Line was until seeing this film. I think we all know about workshopping plays and shows now, but this show was the first one. Mr. Bennett sold the concept and found several years' funding to develop the show. Everyone in the Broadway community knows how hard the life of chorus dancers is and I think was interested in seeing a show that honored them. Mr. Bennett ""wrote"" the show by committee. The stories are true, though the film points out that he might have done a lot better giving more credit to the contributors. The concept was so compelling that Marvin Hamlisch, then making a very good living doing Hollywood films, dropped everything and went to NYC to write the music. The story about retitling one of the songs is special.

The stories about making the show and the archival films bring back wonderful memories and give great insight to the original show and the inspiration to/for the revival. Having principals from the original show staging the new one gives us a special look at why casting for this revival was so hard to do. Most important to the director and backers was whether they should even dare to try reproducing this most perfect of all Broadway shows. Would they be able to honor the spirit of both the show and Michael Bennett? Well, I saw the show (on tour, not on Broadway) and think they did Mr. Bennett and the original cast proud.

Because the show was so personal, the selection of the cast was also very personal. Every one of the over 3000 people trying out was auditioned. There were no ""resume only"" cuts. Every performer was treated with the utmost respect, and well they should have been. The people trying out are exactly the same ones Michael Bennett workshopped and personally selected for his show, only a newer generation. There are descendants of the original cast. There are people who have been around a long time and are most certainly wondering if it's time to hang up their shoes. There are people with more talent than a single human ought to have. There are people who have what might seem like too much ego and some with so much modesty that you wonder how they get themselves on a stage. The creative team is often moved, as is the audience, by the auditions. There are people they want in the show and there are people who knock their socks off. Most of all, these are people who LOVE what they do and are willing to work possibly beyond their own capabilities to get a part in this show that honors their work.

It was easy for someone who loves the show like me to get quickly involved. I have friends who have not seen the show who got hooked almost as quickly as I did. Nobody I knew at the preview screening ""survived"" the film with dry eyes, and we all sat through to the last credit, savoring the film to the very last second. For those who have only seen the film adaptation -- just forget a lot of what you saw and who did the songs. Every Little Step gets it right. Those of you who claim to not like Broadway shows can find much to like in watching these very talented people competing for jobs which, in many cases, are the goal they've been shooting for all their careers. They work so hard and bare their souls trying to be ""the one"". ""I really need this job"" isn't just a song, it's the real thing here. Many of the people auditioning are on unemployment. And you just can't help getting involved. There was lots of applause when certain performers were selected. There was much discussion after the film about why their -- mine, too -- person wasn't chosen. For instance, I think you'll be glad to know the person who wasn't chosen for the role of Cassie has gone on to do much great featured work in the DC area. She's really good, too! Take it from someone who's seen her live.

3756872,5,B001PR0XZO,"This documentary, lovingly constructed and produced, is a must-have for anyone interested in the process of auditioning, the emotional journey of an actor, and the components of putting on a show. As a performer and an educator, I find this engaging film to be a fascinating look into the heartache, the triumph, the passion, and the resilience of people driven by their love of the theatre. It captures so much of the work of the theatre practitioner, from the creation, from the truth of its inspiration to the discipline of the performers, to the challenging task of the casting director to the vision of the director and choreographer to ultimately the audience's integral role in the final most crucial part of the entire process. Films like this, and Moon Over Broadway and Show Business, are such amazing and affectionate portraits of a world and a people who realize that talent and ambition are often not enough but when the stars align, the reward for all involved is like nothing else in the world.

3756873,5,B001PR0XZO,"I too saw ""Every Little Step"" with only a few other audience members in a theater that could have held ten times more.  I too sacrificed my dream to earn a living, although I managed to stay associated with the arts.  I too accept that a typical reviewer of films for the media would probably not give ""Every Little Step"" five stars.  Maybe three. There are no exploding helicopters, no car crashes, no sadistic murders, just an intimate view of incredibly sensitive, talented individual, different and unique people all willingly venturing into a state of complete vulnerability, reaching deeply into their emotions, bodies and minds to create and recreate musical theatre, something so elusive even the world's foremost professionals live in uncertainty and abject terror before each audition, before each premier performance.  I was enraptured throughout the film.  Eagerly give it a five stars.  Now at 75 I keep trying, admitting that dance is out of the question, but I can keep trying as a playwright-librettist-lyricist and sometime actor.  I will get ""Every Little Step"" in DVD as soon as it is available, adding it to my copy of the playscript and DVD of the film of ""A Chorus Line"", Baayork's and Thommie's ""On the Line, The Creation of A Chorus Line"", and Donna McKechnie's bio, ""Time Steps.""

8334397,4,B001PR0XZO,"A CHORUS LINE is an unexpectedly brutal piece of theatre about the audition process and the people who endure it for the sake of their artin this specific case, dance.  It opened in New York in 1975 and won a Pulitzer for drama, nine Tony awards, seven Drama Desk awards, and went onto become the longest running musical in Broadway history until bested in 1997 by CATS.  It is a touchstone of American musical theatre, and it has had numerous productions and revivals in the years since its debut.

The documentary EVERY LITTLE STEP follows the audition process for the 2006 Broadway revival of A CHORUS LINE from the initial open audition, which drew over three thousand people, to opening night.  Along the way the film presents archival footage of original director/choreographer Michael Bennet, who conceptualized the play, and interviews with composer Marvin Hamlisch and members of the original company.  But the focus is on the dancers, and the process of their audition, which in many ways mirrors the process the show characters must endure to be castor not, as case may be.  The result is often quite as harsh as the play, with some chosen and some not, and all the frustrations and extremes that implies.

Its a good documentary and a good look inside what it is like to audition for a major Broadway production, and a good examination of the people who are willing to spend weeks, months of auditions and call-backs in the hope they will make the final the cut.  That said, theres simply too much going on in the film for it to have the depth wed likewhich is pretty much the same issue with A CHORUS LINE itself.  The dancers are too often fleetingly presented and then lost.  But hey, thats the nature of commercial theatre, and as one auditioning dancer who doesnt make the cut says, Im a big girl, I can take it.  Recommended.
