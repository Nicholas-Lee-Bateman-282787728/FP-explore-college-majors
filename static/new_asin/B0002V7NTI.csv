8032200,5,B0002V7NTI,"A & E does a terrific job of telling the story of Milton Hershey. He was one of America's truly great entrepreneurs. He made excellent quality chocolate available to the common man when previously only the rich could  afford it. He cared for his employees' quality of life and well being at a  time when business owners were known to be ruthless and abused their  workers. This is a great video and I highly recommend it to anyone who has  ever enjoyed a piece of chocolate! The video moves fast, and is  fascinating, motivating, as well as informative.",936921600,44,553,4.6020408163265305
