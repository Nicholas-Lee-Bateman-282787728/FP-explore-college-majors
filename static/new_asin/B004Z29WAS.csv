4504537,4,B004Z29WAS,"To be honest, this movie is strange and leaves you not believing what you have just witnessed. The Future is a beyond strange and probably the weirdest movie I've ever seen. The movie is narrated by a cat, yes, a cat that is soon to die within months to years, this couple is getting that same cat in 30 Days, so the cat is waiting for them. The couple decide to spend their last 30 days on something they want to do. Anyways, this is by far the weirdest movie, but most definitely not the best movie I've seen all year.

It is a gift to intellectual artists and philosophers everywhere looking for inspiration and deeper meaning in films.  Bravo to July.  She has much to be proud of.",1322956800,,270,5.232558139534884
4504539,5,B004Z29WAS,"Great imagination! This film has everything: narration from a cat, a talking moon, a man who can stop time, and a woman's heart in the shape of a yellow T-shirt. I think the cat is a metaphor for an unwanted pregnancy. Dealing with this both the woman and man hide out from life. The woman has an affair. The man stops time but only for himself. The world goes on without him.

Listen to the talking moon. Live your life fully.",1322870400,,427,4.271604938271605
4504540,5,B004Z29WAS,"When an aimless couple decides to adopt a cat, they realize there is no turning back and their future is now. They decide it's time to make some real changes in their life. You could call it pop existentialism for the youtube generation, but that undersells how hilarious and devastating and thoughtful is this latest creation from artist and filmmaker Miranda July.

Held together with narration from ""PawPaw"" the cat, the film follows the efforts of Sophie and Jason to finally accomplish something, to live in the moment now they realize it's slipping them by. They resolve to seize opportunities as they come, to follow destiny wherever it calls them. She gets inspired by a series of youtube videos to create and upload a series of ill-conceived dance routines. He follows up on an ad and befriends an older man selling a used hairdryer. Where else do we find our callings, in an age where to be is to be online? Much of what she says comes across as a deadpan comic routine, acted out on screen, that's both laugh-out-loud funny and utterly depressing to see ourselves in the almost pathetic need to be looked at and liked. When you translate into everyday life the intensity of interest in how many views a video gets or how many ""likes"" a comment online receives, it makes painfully obvious that the existential ideal of living authentically has turned into an obsession with exposure. Seeing important life decisions made with the same casual carelessness with which I sometimes waste away my downtime clicking on this or that link, managed at once to make me smile and evoke a feeling similar to what existentialists called ""despair.""

Don't go into it expecting something conventional. Expect unusual dance, a performance art piece, an extraordinary routine, that nevertheless sheds light on the momentousness of even our most ordinary moments.",1322784000,3,1855,4.9423076923076925
4504541,5,B004Z29WAS,"A film filled with beautiful human themes!  Synchronicity, Self Doubt, Love, Selfishness and a whole lot of fear.  No, this isn't ""Love Actually"" folks.  It's Miranda July!  She whole heartedly and naturally provides food for thought. I was captivated, moved, and at times severely uncomfortable.  Thank you, Ms. July, another beautiful film that will stay with me.",1322784000,5,365,5.333333333333333
4504542,1,B004Z29WAS,"For the first 90% of this movie, I sat enthralled and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie - it was deep, witty, and full of surprises. But then Ms. July (who wrote, directed, and starred in multiple roles) decided to take a very bad turn which left me feeling thoroughly depressed and totally ruined all the previous enjoyment. It wasn't really necessary for the plot and didn't really match the mood of the rest of the movie, either. It turned it into one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies.

(I don't want to give away the plot by detailing what I found so disturbing, but it'll be pretty obvious if you watch the movie.)

Watch at your own risk...",1322611200,12,701,4.46875
4504543,5,B004Z29WAS,"Miranda July's new film is a fascinating, eerie, unsettling film that does not please those viewers who like a straightforward plot line, a clearly recognizable happy ending, and an uplifting, 'moral' message. It addresses the inner insecurities that play such a major role in our life, in our relationship, and in the way we look at reality. I saw the film in a movie theater with a friend and we loved it.",1314662400,19,407,4.666666666666667
4504544,5,B004Z29WAS,"I just really loved this movie. It explored some of the gray areas in life and people's daily stress of ""am I going to reach my potential."" Some really great and endearing characters including ""Paw Paw."" You'll read some reviews who didn't like it but there are a lot of metaphors in the movie that you really wouldn't understand unless you've been through that event in your own life. I'll give you one as an example: There's a point where Sophie delivers some very upsetting news to her boyfriend and he stops time for a good while before he lets her say anything. I've had a woman deeply disappoint me and I shut myself off from the world and basically just went into a mental coma for over a month and for me time did stop. I think that's what she was trying to portray. A lot of the film is left up to the viewer to answer. I love that and I love the movie. Can't wait to buy it.",1314489600,21,884,4.175438596491228
4504545,2,B004Z29WAS,"Failure to connect with each other, and with the relationships they try with others. Failure to connect with a pet who could have loved them. Failure to connect with her muse of dance. Failure to connect with their own futures, individually or together. Everything they do seems, somehow, to stop short of completion and fulfillment. In fact, I came out of this movie wanting to do something, anything, just to see something come to an actual finish.

The few surreal moments - his stopping time, or her speeding through a whole generation in moments - stand out. Although enjoyable and useful to the story, they also stand somewhat out of place in this otherwise quasi-realistic narrative. Not a movie for everyone, me in particular.

4504582,4,B004Z29WAS,"There is narrative, there is the escape into ""art"" properly framed, there is the appearance of certainty, of conclusions, of clear cause and effect, and then there is the reality of our own lives and minds. Within our own lives and minds we keep at bay, so to speak, chaos, by establishing routines, by doing work, by creating a new life in a child in whom we invest our ""plans"", ""goals"", ""learned behaviours"" ""values"" and so on. To what extent is each of us fascistic - wanting to control not just our child, but our world? Is one result of this, gated communities? Is one result of this the fear of the ""other""? Is another result of this the strong desire to grasp at answers provided by religions?
Miranda July to me seems to understand the chaos within the mind of the educated,middle class, Western individual and she gives realisation to the tug that goes on between resting back on ""routine"" and giving in to curiosity and reaching out in some of form of improvisation towards some new experience. In this regard there does seem a connection with improvised music. The two protagonists use one of the most haunting and beautiful popular ballads ever penned as an anchor - that song is Where or When by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart and the version they listen to is one recorded by Peggy Lee backed by Benny Goodman a few weeks after Pearl Harbour so iOS especially laden with feeling and power.
Writer Ben Lerner wrote about a ""poem""...is understand as referring to a failure of language equal to the possibilities it figures."" Ms July is using the language of film (poem) and similarly ""failing"" to accurately, understandably reveal what ""happens"" in relationships, but gee, she gives her film a very, very good shot especially in giving a sense of the reality of misunderstandings that are commonplace in relationships.
I get no sense of self indulgence, of ""why not try some LSD?"", but a genuine sense of individuals yearning to understand and to learn. Sartre I think it was claimed there was only one real question which was that of suicide. Ms July manages to create a film which intensifies the experience of the ordinary making the moon, a cat's paw stretching, a look, a smoothie, a sentence, resonate with a curious power and intrigue. But she also creates a n interest and warmth in the viewer for her characters. No mean feat.",1457222400,2,2347,4.699029126213592

4504687,3,B004Z29WAS,"The Future is a 2011 film directed by and starring Miranda July.  It tells the story of Sophie and Jason, a morosely synchronized couple in their mid-30s who have decided to adopt a cat.  The waiting period for the animal is one month and they decide to use this time before the commitment as a rebirth of routine and philosophy.  It's an odd film.

As I'm getting older, I'm finding that I prefer relaxing cinema.  This is what initially attracted me to The Future and I wasn't disappointed.  But it was also cunningly funny and often eerie.  If you're at all familiar with either actor, I'm sure imagining the level of melancholy their fusion would birth isn't too difficult, but there's something else happening here and it's worth your time.  I wish I had the sort of talent that would let me explain this to you without ruining anything, but the delicate twists offered here would be too easily spoiled.  The humor was unexpected and I'd often be startled also by the dark little corners of this project.

And the cast did a great job.  This is my first time seeing Miranda July and I'm enamored with her style.  Blue-eyed and weird, she's a fluid form moving slowly through this film with these random little bursts of muffled energy that I found hypnotic.  (She's like a heavily sedated Zooey Deschanel to me; quirky, a bit strange.)  Hamish Linklater had a similar effect, if not more haggard and sadly worn.  The interaction between these two felt valid.  As for the rest of the cast, they also bowed to the strangeness and contributed beautifully.  Especially the old man.

I think the only nagging problem I had with this movie was the cat.  The cat narrates the film here and there but does so with a haggish voice that grated on my nerves immediately.  I know they were going for something bizarre there but it didn't feel that way to me - it just seemed off.  But this was only slight problem for me as the cat didn't pop up that often.

If you're looking for something different to do for a couple of hours this is a good start.  There's not much in the way of romance but there is something unsettling about the sort of love written for The Future and, although I'd put a ceiling on how much I'd pay for this disc, I thought it was worth the ride.

Thank you for your time.

The Future bears many similarities to Me And You..., but it's a better, more daring piece in near every aspect. It takes the magic of everyday life a lot farther, making it a real, integral part of the story. It also brings back the humanism of her first film, but this time it comes in a darker, somewhat more pessimistic form. Though I would never call Miranda July's view on things jaded, it is certainly more mature. A lot of what could be considered ""quirky"" and unnecessary by some are actual events and details observed by the director in her day-to-day life. The difference is that where most would just ignore them, she takes interest, and brings them to us.

Now this is not the fastest pace movie you'll ever see, but if you're tired of Hollywood recently and their half-a$$ movies, than this is a wonderful movie showcasing the absurdity of everyday life in a modern-day society and its complex twist and turns that may occur when two people decide to sporadically change their outlook on life.  The extension of the narrator's (Paw-Paw) part in this movie is symbolic and for the most part humorous, in an otherwise dry movie.  There are little surprise moments, as far as one-liners, but altogether is has a very Albert Camus undertone to this movie.  Trust me, if your girlfriend is crying for days as a direct result of this movie, breakup with her, because she didn't get it; and most likely you didn't get it either, because you either don't read enough or don't have an experienced enough palate to enjoy independent features like this.  It's not the worst of movies, but don't kill it for the rest of us.  Good night, everybody.",1325548800,,1123,4.59

4504705,1,B004Z29WAS,"So, my girlfriend had been feeling depressed, lying in bed, seasonal affective, etc., so I suggested that we watch the Miranda July film for which you are reading the review. Based on Miranda's other film, I thought this one would cheer her up. ""I heard it has a cat as the film's narrator!"" I pitched to her. You see, she loves cats and I knew she'd want to get out of bed and watch the movie with me if I mentioned it had a cat. I thought the film would be funny and sweet and and uplifting in a quirky, darkly comic way...big mistake. Big big big mistake. So the cat is terminally ill, and it is injured, and it has had a terrible life of loneliness, and it is in a cage the whole film. All that cat wants in the entire world is to be loved. Every time the cat appeared, and talked about how lonely it was, and how it wanted to be loved, my girlfriend started to cry. Well guess what folks? The annoying, unsympathetic hipster main characters never pick the cat up from the shelter and it is KILLED. My girlfriend practically went into hysterics, the tears pouring down her face. Sound like a good time? Are you depressed and want to get pushed over the edge? Want to see a suffering cat get betrayed and die? Then watch these miserable characters and a sad lonely cat who dies for the sins of vacuous hipsters. My girlfriend is still crying in the next room as I write this and the movie has been over for about fifteen minutes. Thanks for a terrible, depressing, lonely loveless cat killing evening. Also, the two main characters have the same hairstyle and it is distracting.",1324080000,35,1581,4.344594594594595
4504706,5,B004Z29WAS,"This is an intimate, absorbing, exasperating, and ultimately rewarding film, full of unexpected moments and delicate whimsy; but it also can seem dark, eerie, and even heartbreaking.  This is not a movie for everyone.  It is a strongly independent film from a unique and gifted woman with vision and drive to spare.  And even though I think it deserves my highest appreciation, I cannot say to everyone who may read this that I recommend it unreservedly to you.  There are more ""cold pricklies"" in this film than ""warm fuzzies"".  It has a resonance that may not be all that comfortable.  If you plan to watch it, I recommend seeing it through the first time with a sense of maintained distance -- getting too involved has led others to dismiss it as fraudulent and manipulative, with a feeling of having been cheated.  Still others react to the impressionistic, sometimes surreal style and images as pretentious claptrap.  But see how you react.  Then, after assessing your own feelings about it for awhile, watch it again with her commentary, and see if your opinions have altered somewhat.  As for me, I am grateful that independent visionaries like Miranda July have the courage and guts to overcome the overwhelming financial odds, and somehow manage to put their vision on film, even if that vision is more moonlight dark than sunlight bright.",1323993600,9,1348,4.898678414096916

It's the tale of an eccentric young woman whose relationship with her boyfriend is on the rocks; now that stray cat has been adopted, can our heroine get a second chance to make everything right? Miranda July directed and stars in The Future, and the film offers proof of her unique talent -- just don't expect a typical indie dramedy.",1323475200,,548,4.840425531914893

4504709,1,B004Z29WAS,"I usually like art films. At least I like art films that have some coherence. This mess of a film has a meandering bizarre screenplay with confusing editing. The most mundane of realities mix with surprisingly boring magical realism. The two main human characters are really difficult to relate to. The man is a clueless loser and the woman begins by endlessly doing unattractive and poorly executed dance steps and then becomes a vapid and soul-less nasty person. The only interesting character is the cat, who is left waiting at the vet so long that they forget about him and he gets euthanized for neglect. The cat has its own lines and they are very touching, unlike the self-absorbed dopes he got stuck with. Avoid this film. It poses as discussing "" big "" questions but never actually gets around to asking them, let alone answering them.",1323302400,11,844,4.7482993197278915
4504710,1,B004Z29WAS,"This movie was an unpleasant waste of time.  The one character that I cared about, that was most developed, was the cat.  *Spoiler Alert* He got left behind in a cage to be euthanized when they missed picking him up. This film MIGHT have been redeemed if they had managed to actually have a plot that involved ANY character who was worth caring about.  It didn't.  Pointless.  I don't know what else I can say except to keep looking for something worth your time.  I wish I could get back the time I lost waiting for this film to connect in some meaningful way.  I've wasted more posting this, but maybe I've save someone the dreary hour-something spent waiting for anything resembling a plot to actually transpire in front of them.  Just move on.  The world is filled with wonderful, overlooked film.  This just isn't one of them.",1323216000,9,831,4.554054054054054

8449281,1,B004Z29WAS,"Boring slow movie about a brother and sister who are maybe a couple as well, who look like each other, even have the same haircut and a fear of hairbrushes deciding that they will adopt a cat.  Prior to this some creepy voice over like Gollum from Lord of the Rings was going on about some nonsense.  We come to learn when some fake looking cat legs appear to accompany the voice that the voice is the cat.  The siblings must wait 39 days or something like that before they can take the cat home, so like expecting for the first time parents realise these are the last days they'll be able to do whatever they want before the responsibility of having to look after the cat takes over.  So they get up to really exciting stuff like the guy volunteers to go door to door and sell charity trees.  He also buys a drawing of a little girl from the animal shelter when the little girl subject is upset no one will buy it.  She has written her number on the back so when the buyer gets sick of it they can give it back to her.  The sister more bored than us viewers rings it up to ask about the weather.  Really I fast forwarded most of this after that but there's some adultery, freezing of time and other stuff that goes on but none of it is interesting.",1509753600,,1249,4.153526970954357

8449285,1,B004Z29WAS,"I cannot recommend this film. I had seen an earlier movie by Miranda July which was quirky and interesting. So I bought this one in the hope that it would be worth seeing. What a disappointment! It is just a depressing, empty movie with nothing to recommend it. I have no idea what the title means. And at this point I don't care. I once saw a Siskel and Ebert show in which they talked about bad movies and they said something which instantly struck me as true although it had never occurred to me: every bad movie is twice as bad as you think, because it is not only bad for all the reasons you can see, it is also bad for something you can't and never will see - every bad movie takes the place of a good movie that never got made.

8449289,2,B004Z29WAS,"In her earlier work 'Me and You and Everyone We Know', Miranda July used her characters' eccentricities and quirks in combination with her unique artistic voice to create a work which succeeded because it charmed us. In 'The Future', she again reaches into that same toolbox but in trying to create a piece meant to capture the vicissitudes of life..the wildness,untameable aspects which thwart us..she creates a piece that makes the audience feel thwarted as well. I adore Miranda July's daring and inventiveness but this one can be only appreciated on that level alone. As a story, it felt like Million Dollar Baby, ie compelling but ultimately oozing despair and ennui that you partly regret the journey.  I was intrigued by the mechanism of the cat in developing the narrative but what happens to him ultimately just feels gratuitously cruel. Perhaps Ms. July goal was to avoid a sappy happy Hollywood ending..I get it..but at the same time, it still felt like an unneccessary slap across the face. Anyway, I appreciate that this film again brought us the charismatic Miranda July, but I don't think I want to ever watch this movie again.",1479772800,,1142,4.917098445595855
