7710625,2,B01DB1FPQS,"The first two seasons were phenomenal....a HOOT.  The final season....just not funny.  I don't know what happened.  I was disappointed and not laughing when ""Mount Palms"" closed its doors.",1464307200,2,188,5.413793103448276

8755436,1,B01DB1FPQS,Love the show but the disk was damaged beyond repair when played the first time straight from the box.  We were still watching the first two seasons and didn't get to this season until after the window had closed for returning it.  Bummer! Because its a great great show.,1532131200,,271,4.510204081632653

8755442,5,B01DB1FPQS,"One great show with our best character actors/actresses honing unforgettable lovable personas. From the first to the third season, every episode is gold.  Can hospitals, terminal diagnoses, aging, suffering and dying ever be funny, yes it can be affectionately, reflectively and touchingly done with a bit of callousness thrown in.  The regular roles are full of memorable eccentrics plus the guest roles are all treasures.  The stories are pertinent and touching plus the antics are hilarious.  This is first rate comedy.",1512432000,,522,5.407407407407407
