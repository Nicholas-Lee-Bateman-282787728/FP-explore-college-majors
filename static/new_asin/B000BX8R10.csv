2444990,4,B000BX8R10,"Whatever Bill Murray touches turns to gold, so it's no surprise that ""Broken Flowers"" ends up being a highly watchable film despite its flaws, slow pace and unconventional ""indy"" feel that might otherwise make the average moviegoer stay away. I had to hunt high and low to find a theater playing this movie, but it was worth the effort.

I won't rehash the plot again but simply comment on some things I found good (and bad) about the film overall. While a little far-fetched, the plot is interesting and sets up a perfect blend for comedy and drama. Although Bill Murray's former relationships with the 4 women he tracks down are never developed, it was funny to see him in one awkward situation after another. His first encounter is by far the most ""productive"" when he gets to see Alexis Dziena parade buck naked in front of him and then hits the sheets with Sharon Stone. Not bad for one day's efforts, eh? His next 2 encounters are a little dull but the final one with Tilda Swinton is easily the worst, not only because poor Bill gets beat up, but because Tilda Swinton is given a whopping 2 minutes of screen time, if that. Tilda should have demanded more. But that's ok...I have my own Tilda Swinton DVD library at home and can always fall back on that. I'm also a little bummed that Julie Delpy had little screen time too, but I can forgive that.

I agree with other reviewers who said that this movie spends too much time showing Bill Murray driving, or sitting, or staring at his food, or whatever. I know, it's all part of the ""indy movie"" experience. But it does get a little old after a while. But on the bright side, those are the only slow-paced scenes that make this movie's slow pace *seem* slow-paced.

My only real complaint lies in the (seemingly) cheap and just-too-convenient plot coincidences all having to do with the color pink. One of Bill Murray's former girlfriends just happens to use pink business cards. Bill later just happens to come across a pink typewriter next to a pink-colored motorcycle seat. Later, he comes across a young man who may or may not be his son who just happens to have a pink ribbon tied on his backpack. Is the movie trying too hard to tell us something here?

Finally, the end of the film (no spoilers ahead). It ends the way you would expect it to, if you pay attention during the movie. Sort of reminded me of the ending in ""Cast Away."" So what happens to our protagonist now? Well, that's up to the viewer to decide for themselves. Some say endings like this are a cop-out, whereas others see it as appropriate. IMO it depends on the build-up, and it works here.

All in all, a nice film that surely has many hidden meanings that will get clearer with repeated viewings for those inclined. In all honesty I give ""Broken Flowers"" 3 to 3.5 stars but will make it a solid 4 because Bill Murray is just so darn COOL.

Do NOT put your brain on neutral and enjoy.",1123804800,2,2916,4.451310861423221
2444991,3,B000BX8R10,"I have been anticipating the release of ""Broken Flowers"" for a few weeks now. Ever since ""Lost in Translation"", I have fell in love with Bill Murray's films all over again. His film roles of lately have been quirky and very interesting to watch. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for ""Broken Flowers"". The premise of the film is interesting. Don Johnston (Bill Murray) discovers through a mysterious letter that he (supposedly) has a 20 year old son. With the insistence of his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don goes out on a search to find out who wrote the letter and who his son is. He pays a visit to Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.

I found myself a bit bored with the film. The traveling scenes were not necessary. I would have liked to have seen less of Don's visit with Frances Conroy (which for me dragged on longer than it should have been)and more with Tilda Swinton. I thought Don's past with Tilda's character Penny appealed to me the most. I would have liked to have known more about their past relationship. Bill's performance in this film seemed kind of a drag. Jeffrey Wright as Winston stole the film for me. I liked the premise of the film. It is too bad the writing was rather weak.",1123804800,,1247,4.566964285714286
2444992,4,B000BX8R10,"Broken Flowers is no doubt a star-showcase film for Bill Murray, since he is in every single scene, and he managed to delivered a heartfelt if not as funny as his Lost In Translation
performance. This film didn't work well as a comedy, because it's rather slow-paced, conversational, and a lack of jokes. There are numerous silent moments when Murray performs solo scenes, and it seemed like a waste of screentime, considered that the actresses in this film had very little screentime. Murray's interactions with the ex-girlfriend characters were far more captivating and entertaining than the scenes of him observing other people or having flashbacks at the airport and in the plane.

Bill Murray plays an over-the-hill playboy named Don Johnston  as his current girlfriend Sherry(Julie Delpy) calls him before leaving him to do some self-discovery, and confronts to him that she felt like a mistress to him even when he's not even married at his age. Don receives an anonymous letter from one of his ex-friends telling him that he has a 19 year-old son and is on the way to find him. He's surprised and confused, and had to seek the advice of his neighbour Winston(Jeffrey Wright). From there Don would travel on the roads and flights to visit his four ex-girlfriends in hoping to unsolve the mystery.

Sharon Stone plays Laura, a single mother with an ultra-precocious teenage daughter named Lolita(Alexis Dziena), who was always walking around either naked or in bikinis inside the house. Don wondered why Laura would give such a name to her daughter. Frances Conray plays Dora, who's happily married to Ron(Christopher McDonald), and they are successful in realty business. She was very suprised by the unexpected visit from Don, and it was obvious that she still has feeling for him. Jessica Lange plays a lawyer turned ""animal communicator"", and she's by far the most eccentric of them all. Her intense and controlling assistant is played by the scene stealing Chloe Sevigny. Finally, the least exposed Tilda Swinton plays Penny, an angry woman resided next to two mean truckers in an isolated area.

As a fan of Tilda Swinton, Jessica Lange, and especially Julie Delpy who was unforgetable in last year's Before Sunset, I was kind of disappointed that they all had less than ten minutes of screentime. Of all the female characters in this film, the most striking were Sharon Stone and Frances Conray. Jeffrey Wright provided some comic relief moments opposite Murray. Overall, Murray is very good with his restraint and subtle expressions. Even though this is a flawed movie, but Murray's Oscar-caliber performance is quite worthwhile, and the supporting cast is just irresistable.",1123632000,,2689,5.063205417607223
2444993,4,B000BX8R10,"Don Johnston (Bill Murray) receives an anonymous pink letter notifying him that he may have a nineteen year old son who may be looking for him. At a bit of a cross roads in his life; his current girlfriend (Julie Delpy) has just dumped him, he is a bit lost, unsure what to do with the money he made from the Internet boom. He sits in his house, in the dark, thinking, watching old movies, contemplating. His next door neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), a father with five kids, three jobs and a penchant to become a detective, suggests he visit each of the five women he had relationships with during this period. After some research, Winston determines one of the women died, but comes up with an itinerary to visit the other four. Don is certain that if anything, the letter is a joke, but eventually agrees to Winston's elaborate game, more because he doesn't have anything else to do. Don sets off on his journey and eventually visits Laura (Sharon Stone), Dora (Frances Conroy), Carmen (Jessica Lange) and Penny (Tilda Swinton).

""Broken Flowers"", the newest film from writer/ director Jim Jarmusch, is a very good study of one man's journey for meaning in his life. The film is funny at times, touching at times and very, very slow. The pacing is almost glacial. There are a lot of shots which end with Bill Murray's character staring off screen as the film does a slow (very slow) fade away. I don't mind this, but I feel that people should be aware of it before they go. Unfortunately, much like people feel it is okay to talk in theaters because they are conditioned to watching DVDs at home, and talking during the film, people are conditioned to expect a faster pace in their films. The majority of films released today barely hold an image for two seconds, so afraid that the attention of the audience will wander. If a film is for adults, don't worry about this. But I think Jarmusch takes it to the other extreme in ""Flowers"", the slow fades are nice, but there are too many and they impact the film.

Murray is clearly making a new cottage industry for himself. In his last few films, which were, coincidentally, his most well-reviewed films, he plays very quiet people, observing a lot of the action around him, essentially transforming himself into the straight man. In ""Lost in Translation"", he played an actor in Japan, making a commercial, lost in the sea of culture swirling around him. In ""Flowers"", he plays a role which is even more cerebral, but the portrayal works. We watch Johnston as he thinks about things. Not exactly thrilling on paper, but Murray makes it work.

Jarmusch sets up the film to allow Murray to react to the various characters he comes into contact with. His relationship with Winston, played by Jeffrey Wright, is humorous and adds a lot to the portrayal of each. For Murray, this solidifies our feelings that he is lost, nothing to do, nothing to care about. When Winston presents him with the plan, Johnston is so reluctant to participate that when he eventually does, we get the depth of his longing for something to do.

Wright's character is funny and multifaceted. With five kids, three jobs and a hobby, he is a ball of energy compared to Murray, which also adds a lot of depth to Murray's character. Their relationship is unique, funny and interesting. When Winston calls Don, Johnston springs (well, for his character anyway) over to his house to help.

As Johnston visits each of his former girlfriends, he reacts to the craziness in each of their lives. Two of these works really well, the other two don't, creating an uneven balance. Stone and Lange seem to have the most richly observed characters. Their lives are unique and strange, polar opposites from each other, allowing Murray to react and create some real, genuine laughter. Conroy's Dora is stiff and emotionless and I didn't get any connection between them. Dora's husband (Christopher McDonald) is slightly amusing, but the sequence is too long. Conversely, Tilda Swinton's Penny is on screen for all of two minutes, making her role the shortest and most difficult to accept and understand.

A couple of times, people mistake Don's name for the former ""Miami Vice"" star. He quietly corrects them. This seems like a joke that wasn't completely worked out. Is Jarmusch trying to make fun of Don Johnson's past? If so, the idea seems half-baked.

It seems odd to me that Murray is receiving so much acclaim for such low key performances. His performances are so good, that he deserves the acclaim, but for someone who started his career in high energy comedies, the transformation is all the more remarkable. I thought Murray was great in ""Lost in Translation"" and he is very good here. But after ""Translation"", ""Life Aquatic"" and now ""Broken Flowers"", each performance seems to have slightly less energy, as though he is simply content to stand and react. And the performances work. But I wonder if his next film will feature him sleeping through the entire film. It seems like the next natural step. And Murray will no doubt make it work.

""Broken Flowers"" is a very good, but not great film. It features a very good performance from Murray and some interesting supporting characters. But the pacing is so slow and the supporting performances are uneven, robbing the film of lasting interest, greatness and longevity.",1123459200,2,5339,4.764324324324324
2444994,5,B000BX8R10,"A sad and funny film, Broken Flowers features Bill Murray as Don Johnston, a disaffected, lonely playboy who, with the encouragement of his neighbor Winston, goes on a quest to find four ex-lovers who might tell him about an alleged son that Don fathered nineteen years earlier. Confronting his past, he realizes his limitations and shortcomings as a man who, too scared and selfish to love, is afflicted with an aching hole in his heart.

The film's plot device is amazingly simple. Once he agrees to search for the mother of his alleged son, the film is broken down into four episodes, each visit to a former girlfriend more painful than the previous one. And we see our Don Juan crushed with a sense of a life wasted on caprices and selfish, adolescent passion.

The film is hilarious if you are fond, like I am, of Bill Murray's priceless expressions of disgruntled cynicism and irony. There is nothing forced or contrived in the film--its plot, its pacing, its themes. The film is assured and confident in what it has to say and as such has nothing in common with the predictable films that try to overwhelm you every second.

One of the major themes of this film is the fear of attachment and as such I would compare it favorably to two other films--You Can Count On Me and The Station Agent.",1123372800,30,1298,4.586206896551724
2444995,5,B000BX8R10,"For the uninitiated, Jim Jarmusch cinematic creations are full of existentialism and messages left for the audience to ponder.  The films are philosophically dense where there are no single true answers to Jarmusch's questions, yet each viewer will have to strive to find their own interpretation.  All of his adventures contain a deeper meaning such as the transcending Mystery Train (1989) where people pass through Memphis to the spiritual Western, Dead Man (1995) with Johnny Depp, while Jarmusch also touches on eastern philosophy in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999).  Broken Flowers continues on the path that Jarmusch has laid out for himself without deviating from his thoughtful guidance to cerebral enlightenment.

There are several reasons why Jarmusch's films are fascinating.  One of the reasons is his visual sense of capturing the essence of time and place, which he efficiently makes use of in the opening of Broken Flowers.  The first scene allows the audience to see a hand mailing a pink personal letter, which is then followed through the technology of the postal services until it arrives in the mailbox of Don Johnston (Bill Murray).  There are numerous scenes where Jarmusch allows a motionless camera to capture Don's current existence, which brings out the melancholic state that he is experiencing.  The first impression might be boredom, for the audience, but if the audience submerges themselves into the story with thoughtfulness they will discover a gem among cinema that deals with existentialism.

Another reason why Jarmusch makes his films interesting is the characters that he has in his film.  In this film, Don is a has-been Don Juan with countless number of ex-girlfriends who has lived a life in the moment and never seized the opportunity to plan for the future.  This seems to bother him, as he often remains immobile, which suggests that he is in a contemplative state.  Yet, he never reaches any conclusions, as nothing ever seem to change around him.  For something to happen, an external event must take place that forces him to do something, and in this case it is the pink letter.  The story surrounds the pink letter, which he opens in the company with his Ethiopian neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright).  Through the letter Don finds out that he has a son with a woman he met some 20 years ago, but she kept it a secret until now.  However, the letter does not disclose anything in regards to who sent it, or where it comes from.  Thus, Winston coerces Don to solve the mystery and find the mother, which is easier said than done.

Winston's forcefulness ushers Don to begin something he would never have done by himself, as Winston asks him to write a list of the women that he thinks could be the possible mothers.  With the help of Internet and Mapquest.com Winston finds the women and he produce an extensive traveling plan for Don to see all the women.  Don sets off to find the women while listening to Winston's home burnt CD with Ethiopian modern music, which helps generate the mystifying atmosphere that often lingers in Jarmusch's films.  It becomes a journey into Don's past, as he seems to find the things that drew him to these women.  Furthermore, the audience will discover the similarities among the women, which in itself offers additional amusement.

Broken Flowers plays with visual symbolism in regards to how the environment and people change with time while it is experienced in the present, as Don ponders the future and visits the past.  Bill Murray's performance might feel familiar with Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Lost in Translation (2003), however, he deals with different issues in this film and succeeds in pulling off a unique performance.  In addition, there are several strong performances by several actors including Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton and many others who enhance the silent and melancholic character that Bill Murray presents.  Under Jarmusch's direction the actors deliver dry comedy with moments of laughter, but also a more meaningful existence where he leaves the audience to think about the philosophical possibilities of the past, present, and future.",1123200000,9,4199,5.0230880230880235
2444996,2,B000BX8R10,"""Broken Flowers,"" I guess, is supposed to be this long, contemplative film about a man's journey into his past to discover how his life and history of loves has added up. Initially, the film is structured as a mystery - as Bill Murray's character tries to find the old girlfriend who bore his son, but it's more about the journey than the destination.

But, to me, this movie was one of the most boring things I've ever sat through. There are an endless number of minutes-long takes of Bill Murray driving a car by himself. There are several scenes of him sitting alone in his living room, listening to the stereo and thinking. A couple of these scenes, where the silences could be meaningful and carry depth, would be fine in a film like this, if the film carried more weight or gave Murray's character more of a background than ""a bemused, aging Don Juan."" Instead, once the movie ends, I felt like it contained several good scenes where Murray interacted with the old girlfriends and about 30 minutes of dead air. Why, why, WHY were there four editing cuts done as Murray drove a Taurus down a country road? Wouldn't one shot establish the plot point as much as is necessary? I get it. He's driving.

Oh, and I figured out that Murray's character was an aging Don Juan within the first five minutes, when he's watching the movie about Don Juan. I didn't need to have Julie Delpy call him ""Don Juan,"" then have Jeffrey Wright call him ""Don Juan,"" then have everyone comment on how his name is Don Johnston. I get the point. Don't hammer it into the ground.

This is not a good movie. If it gets across-the-board good reviews, I'll be baffled. It's pretentious, meaningless and doesn't go very far. It doesn't function as a mystery. It doesn't function successfully as an illustration of a character. Good actors, like Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and Sharon Stone, are given little to do in episodic scenes.

2444999,4,B000BX8R10,"I received this movie as a gift from a friend.  The film is definately not for everyone, but any man who has dated a woman, broken up with her, and then wonder if she was better or worse off because of the encounter will definately relate to this movie.  One reviewer here said,  ""Bill Murray sleep-walks though this movie"" and I disagree.  I think this reviewer was confusing the actor with the character.  The charactor Murray plays is definately sleep-walking through this part of his life.  That is why he  receives an anonymous  letter informing him that the has a son.  Someone is trying to wake him up.  This movie will probably appeal to males more than females.  I gave a copy of this movie to a female friend and the end result was her yelling at me.",1502668800,,760,4.434782608695652
2445000,5,B000BX8R10,"I can see if you are not about the age of the character and have your own share of history like his, you might hate this movie.  But it seems to realistic, how each person's lives took twists over between their youth and middle and they ended up in a life they never imagined.  One gal a nice but directionless widow of a race car driver with a precosious teen daughter who works rearranging closets, a former hippy-gal from the free-love 60s now looking trapped in a sterile suburban neighborhood with a 2-dimensional husband and life, one woman formerally passionate to become a lawyer, now working as a high-end ""animal communicator"" and appears to have a lesbian relationship with the very young, angry receptionist of her office, last woman living way out in the country in a ragged shack, her appearance and reactions look like she may be a mental case or heavy drug user (just a guess).  Murray is pushed to find the mother of his supposed 17-year old son but his neighbor, able to be kind and interested in each woman, but seems all their lives are empty and unfulfilled.  Still it is not an unhappy movie at all, but more like real life.  I thought it was amazing because it parallels so much reality, you can't predict it, and the end is like real life, not really sure you learned anything or what your future is.  I liked it and thought it was very well-done, but I can see how a lot of people just wouldn't get it.

His character is an unappealing, solitary man who shows no interest or emotion; Murray pretty much phones in his performance, so underplaying his role that I wondered why he bothered at all. It's an intriguing premise that goes absolutely nowhere and the ending feels like the writer just ran out of ideas and stopped writing.

It was two hours long, but it felt like six.  Mr. Jarmusch stated that he wrote the script for this movie in two weeks.  In my opinion, he took too long.  It shouldn't have taken him longer than two days, three tops.  It's as slow as a brontosaurus, boring as a Presbyterian, trite as a tube of toothpaste, and the story has nothing interesting to say about anything.

The ever-changing cast, whose major players never last long enough to settle down and get comfortable, makes it an act with several faces but no identity.

He manages to rouse himself from the couch long enough to utter a few weak words of protest but Sherry hits the road.  Good for her!

I liked Bill Murray in Lost in Translation---the script was clever enough to support his aged, cynical, middle-aged man character.  Here that character is exploited and magnified, and we are treated to many, many. long minutes of this dreadful, basset-hound-like countenance, behind the wheel, on a plane, in an airport, on a couch.  He shows no emotion, only an occasional flash of testosterone as he views a thigh here and there.  That's what passes for love, in the heart of this soul-less man, and no wonder all the ladies left him.

In order to sustain a viewer through two hours of film, the central character should be someone we care about.  I didn't see anything in this man, other than a knee-jerk response to his wonderful neighbor's family, to even remind me that he was alive.
I guess his humor was supposed to be drole and dead-pan, but it was very light on the drole and way too heavy on the dead-pan.

On the plus side, we got to see some wonderful, aging women actors perform---Sharon Stone was gorgeous as the desperate, lusty trailer park ex; Jessica Lange was terrifically scary-intense as the ""animal interpreter"" and Tilda Swinton was good, too, as the biker-chick.  Jeffrey Wright, as the Ethiopian neighbor, Winston, brings some much needed humanity into the picture---very much Don's ""dark-side.""

Yeah, it's fashionable to resist the temptation to give ""Hollywood Happy Endings"" in the Indie-World...But here Jarmuscsh has carried out the lack of any sort of conclusion to the ultimate point of not-caring.  The idea of sending this guy on the trail of his past is brilliant.  The fact is, when he bothered to meet these women, he didn't say anything that could have helped him to understand why these relationships never worked.  Where did he go wrong?  What could he learned now that would help him to resolve his Don Juan complex and learn to truly love?  When the ex's ask him why he's there, he just gives lame responses like ""I was in the neighborhood.""  The thing is, it's Winston, with his healthy life urge, who has propelled this guy onto the road, to solve the mystery.  The mystery is ostensibly to find the actual mother of the son, but we know that the real mission is for the aging lothario to find himself.

The fact that this film maker has set up such a promising plot and then dropped it makes me angry. It could have been a film of substance, in which a real human being learns something but Jarmusch dropped the ball and contented himself with a stylistic trick.

I also object to the condescending treatment the four ex-girlfriends are given.  Each one is shown in the most negative light. As another reviewer wrote, I was glad when the biker guy punched our hero in the nose---he deserved it.

The obvious elephant-in-the-middle-of-the-room issue, which I will dare to mention, is---what did these four attractive women ever see in this guy in the first place?  I think this is a guy's movie, made by a guy, with a guy's fantasy point of view.  The fact that this really ugly guy with zero personality once had all these beautiful women, some of whom look like they still want him, is sheer wish-fullfillment on the part of the director in my humble female opinion.

I was going to give this three stars, but now that I think about it, I'm reducing it to two.  The two stars are not for the writer-director, nor for Bill Murray, but for the wonderful women actors who showed up for this endeavor and for the promise of what this film could have been.",1328313600,3,3835,4.644444444444445

You wish he'd snap out of it, maybe get some Zoloft or something.  The film's premise is strained so I don't assume it's meant to be taken literally: if Murray's character really wanted to find out who the mother of his son was he'd just wait till the kid showed up and ask him.  And other details, like pink typewriters tossed out in the yard, aren't particularly realistic. On the other hand I wouldn't call it surreal or dream-like, either.  This is the second Jarmusch film I've ever seen (first was Down By Law), and though he has a reputation as an independent film maker, there's a lot of Hollywood and TV sensibility here in the character cliches that pile up: flaky pet psychics, repressed real estate agents, biker chicks, well-off software developers, Lolita-like girls.  Sometimes the jokes are so strained even the characters don't believe them (the ""Don Johnston/Johnson"" thing, the Lolita thing).  I liked the relaxed pacing of it all, though.

Narrow in scope, it's as formally perfect as a Bergman film with no false notes, no unnecessary shots or sequences -- everything in it is as organically connected as a great poem.

With the help and incentive of Winston he start a wonderful story of search, encounter with the past and about how we live our lives.

Each of the four (living) women he had relationships 20 years ago represent several contrasting facets: from the widow that struggles to make a living and raise a child with ingenuity (Fortitude and sexual), the subservient and repressed wife (weakness and asexual), the successful cold ordered academic (order) and the emotional, angry woman who decided to separate from the mainstream world (chaos).

Very well filmed, the director leads us to a voyage or quest that we're eager to succeed. The interpretations of Stone, Lange and Conroy are great. Bill Murray shows a lifeless Don with perfection.

Bill Murray plays the charecter called Don and you are forced to think from Don's point of view, from his eyes. Bill Murray is almost perfect in his role and makes you think what would it be like to be in Don's shoes. Its the story about Don, his present and then certain things that introduce us to some of his old aqcuaintances, takes him and us to a journey to his past.

2445067,3,B000BX8R10,"The problems with Broken Flowers are not so much caused by the movie--although it is very slow paced, enough to drive some people insane--but by the marketing.  This movie is not hilarious, it's not a comedy at all; that a film has a couple of moments where you laugh does not make it a comedy.  Nor does the casting of a primarily comedic actor in the lead make it a comedy.  When Murray re-made The Razor's Edge, he explicitly said, ""This is not a comedy"" to every talk show host who would listen.  But the studio undercut him by sending along a clip of the only funny moment in the entire film.  And so here as well.  Murray does nothing to make this a comedy; he clearly wants to be taken as a 'serious' actor.  But someone in marketing thought that would be the kiss of death.  So they've labelled a dark study of a man alone as hilarious and a comedy; it's actually a tragedy.  Murray's character is emotionally detached from everyone, and has no understanding of how to reconnect.  I'm reminded of Camus.  Murray rarely shows any expression at all; the director emphasizes this by showing repeated shots of the back of Murray's head.  What happens in this film is that nothing happens.  Those flowers are broken for a reason--exactly what that reason is we are never told, nor do we particularly need to know--and no florist's trick can ever heal them.  Going to a film with wildly wrong expectations can ruin the experience for a lot of people--no one on the creative side was done any favors by Hollywood's relentless quest for the dollar.",1239580800,2,1548,4.541516245487364

He has played the same basic character in films from Groundhog Day to Lost In Translation to his latest incarnation in Jim Jarmusch's latest film Broken Flowers. This film is one of those works of art that should be filed under `nice attempt', but is ultimately a failure. And it fails for the simplest of reasons that all bad films fail: a bad screenplay, which was written by Jarmusch himself.
  Murray plays a former Lothario named Don Johnston, who made a fortune in personal computers, watches The Adventures Of Don Juan on tv (for all call him a Don Juan), and whose girlfriend Sherry (Julie Delpy) is leaving him. His Ethiopian friend and neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), is a mystery writer and amateur detective. On the day Sherry leaves Don gets an unsigned letter in a pink envelope, typed in red ink, from a former girlfriend saying that twenty years ago he fathered her son, and he may be searching for him. Don is is pushed by Winston to search for the writer of the letter. The first of his ex-girlfriends he visits is Laura (Sharon Stone). She's a NASCAR widow, whose daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena), is a gorgeous nymphet who nakedly tries to seduce Don (wow, what a shock!). She does not succeed, but Laura does (ah, film!- only in such a medium could a guy like Murray, and a cipher of a character like Don, have a prayer of bedding Sharon Stone- or her onscreen lookalike). Don, in Murrayvian fashion, never tells her his real reason for the trip, then later fantasizes about....of course, Lolita- yes, it's really that heavyhanded in its attempts at symbolism.
  His second ex-lover is Dora (Frances Conroy), who, with her husband Ron (Christopher McDonald), are realtors of pre-fab homes. Again Murray equivocates and does not reveal the reason for his trip to see her. The nest woman on his list is New Age pet psychic Carmen (Jessica Lange), whose lesbian assistant (Chloe Sevigny) resents Don's intrusion. Carmen's so fruity that Don does not even attempt to really tell her why he stopped by. His fourth ex-lover is Penny (Tilda Swinton), a biker chick whose boyfriend punches Don out when she goes psycho just a minute after meeting him. A fifth lover is now dead, and he returns to his posh home, and Winston, unsatisfied....Others have detailed the rest of the film.... Jarmusch is still a daring director, but he seems to be in mid-life crisis mode, not knowing what he will do next, or what he should do.",1220832000,,2626,4.72707423580786

2445072,5,B000BX8R10,"I am a big fan of Jarmusch and Bill Murray and when the two come together we see a great character named Don Johnston come to the screen.  When auteur Jarmusch focuses on an actor he tends to give them the freedom they need to really bring a character to life.  Like all of Jarmusch's films this one is filled with ""in-between"" moments, an obsession that Jarmusch has had and made obvious in other works such as Coffee and Cigarettes and Night on Earth, the moment that most film makers would cut away from but in Broken Flowers many of them become very meaningful and and interesting scenes.

One scene of this film will always stay with me because of the emotion Murray is able to convey as he sits under a tree.  The short scene is perhaps the best acting I have ever seen from Bill Murray and his ability to convey emotion seems to shine in this film.

One thing that really amazes me about Broken Flowers is the amount of interpretation this film provides.  The film has something for each viewer providing they are patient with it.  This film is not one you should watch when you are tired and trying to relax because the film depends on viewer involvement.  I own this film and every time I've watched it I have found different personal interpretations.  In fact so much that I have had late night conversations and made very great films who reported it as one of their favorite films when I asked them what kind of movies they liked.

Like most Jarmusch films this film I believe is rooted in literature (Jarmusch did major in English at college) and I think the names of the various characters that Murray meets will show you the irony that Jarmusch provides.

This film made a serious impression on me and became reasons that I have seen all his work and study film.  This was my intro to his work and I believe one of his easier films to watch much like Dead Man.  I throughly enjoyed the soundtrack and its placement in the film.  You will only get out of this movie what you put into it but if you think deeply on the small moments in the film you'll find it a rewarding experience.",1219622400,,2095,4.37984496124031

I found his neighbor Winston interesting.  I thought his love for mysteries endearing, plus, he seemed to know Don better than he knew himself.  As much as I found the subject matter interesting, the pacing can try the average viewer.  It was just a bit too slow for my taste and I really don't care for open endings like this.  But there are some things to like about the production.",1218326400,,554,4.382352941176471

There's no over the top scenarios in the Hollywood sense.  The story is a little bleak, yet for some reason it appeals to me.  Think ""Lost in Translation"".  Bill Murray is a master at being depressed yet still making you smile.  This movie is also accompanied by a great soundtrack.

No, this movie isn't hilarious but it's a great movie with many different emotions and left open to many different interpretations.  It's worth watching.",1206403200,,581,4.617647058823529
2445075,4,B000BX8R10,"-- a partial quote from Bill himself; Don, in the movie.

He chases these women from the past that he was involved with and asks all of them (except the one who hated that he showed) a series of questions when all he wants to know if he had a son he doesn't know about (with them).

He searches and searches, as a series of events happen; he visits a long haired blond woman, who isn't home at the time. Her daughter is, however. She's very ditzy, but open. When she goes to answer the phone, and Don gets up to look at some pictures to help him find out more about the family, she comes back, stark naked, and doesn't even act like Don's there. Maybe she forgot or didn't care. Either way, she was beautiful.

Most guys will go wild for this scene. She just turns, continues to talk on the phone and exits, going into another room or upstairs...(can't remember, wasn't paying attention to that!)

The next lady he visits, after having no luck with the last is an animal communicator.
""Are you an animal psychic?"" Don asks.
I laughed.
""No."" she politely, yet seriously chimes. ""I'm a communicator."" she says, with a smile.
Then the cute cat is let in, and eventually Don asks,
""Is he saying anything?""
""Yes."" she says. ""He says that you have a hidden agenda."" which was true.

She lets the cat out and then as Don persuades her to walk him to his car, they walk out and at the car she doesn't tell much. All we know is that she was married and had one kid; a female who was only 16.

Don searches and searches but you will have to watch it to see the ending and what he finds out.

3.8 stars.

End note: The quote was taken from the end of the movie...the movie was decent though. It kept my attention mostly, and turned out fine.",1204502400,,1730,4.237082066869301

2445077,3,B000BX8R10,"I'm torn. The pace of the film was (MUCH) slower than I expected, but couple that with the relentless, bruising heartache it inspires ... well, this work may have been just too painful for me (personally).

The acting was spot-on. Murray is playful and tender in his role as Don (Juan) Johnston. Though he has made (and makes) some bad decisions, the viewer is never pitted against him (if we were - if hating him were easy - this film wouldn't be as potent). Likewise, Stone is fantastic in her small but memorable role. In fact, I didn't even notice that she was playing ""Laura"" until several minutes of her being on-screen. She was just ""Laura."" Finally, Jeffrey Wright is wonderful as Winston ... Johnston's best (only?) friend. His quirky role is well-written and excellently played.

The music is stark. Even much of the soundtrack is diegetic in nature (we hear the music to which Johnston listens). This dramatically contributes to the overall sense of crushing bleakness. It is just so quiet ... contemplative.

There are many inside-jokes for lovers of film and literature (which I found entertaining). Lolita's giant heart-earrings (framing her face) were clever (see the poster to Kubrick's adaptation). Likewise, the notion of her wanting to share Popsicles with Johnston is equally amusing. And just when you thought the joke would stop there ... it goes OVER THE TOP (no spoilers from me). But, unlike some, I found this moment neither offensive nor distasteful ... I found it outrageous and hysterical.

Still, watching Johnston look for his child in the eyes of every teen-age boy that passes him (the ""model,"" the boy outside the airport, the kid in the car ...) it becomes more than poignant ... it becomes (again) too much. And all the cosmic-collisions and ""coincidences"" ... it begins to feel like the universe is conspiring against this relatively harmless man (and I mean ""relatively"" in the grand-scheme ... since the impassioned reaction of two of the women reveals Johnston's guilt).

I think that Jarmusch has created a truthful film ... but it may be more truth than I (personally) am prepared for (but this is me ... I felt similarly about Reed's ""The Break-Up"" ... night and day comparison, I know). But kudos for creating a sensitive, engaging film which breaks from mainstream dreck. I will continue to experiment with this director's work.",1202256000,,2373,4.93734335839599

2445079,3,B000BX8R10,"Dear Bill, Why are you doing this to us, to yourself, to future generations of potentially giddy viewers? The Razor's Edge is one thing, Lost In Translation another, and now this. But, they're all pretty much the SAME thing!

You're one of the truly great comic actors of your time. If you weren't so funny and so successful at it, you'd never get to make these ""serious"" movies, because you are NOT a serious dramatic actor. So why keep humping that dead camel? The truth becomes clear when there is easily more entertainment in the 7-minute blooper reel than in this entire film.

You pick good directors, but these scripts seem designed to let you sit expressionlessly, scene after scene, as if a tiny tic will convey your inner Brando essence. Your picking these static characters in these inert movies is killing us! It's not that we want to see Carl chase gophers forever, or Todd give noogies. It's just that your making this kind of plodding film is like Michelangelo running a plumbing service. He can do it, sure...but what's the point? There are lots of plumbers in the world. There is only one Michelangelo. Let him do what nobody else can.

And there is only one Bill Murray. He's the guy in the blooper reel who can't help but be funny at every turn with everybody. He's the guy who fills our hearts with joy and mirth and feeling. But he seems nowhere present in this and your other ""serious"" movies, and the guy who replaces him is, well, rather boring.

When you go halfway, as in Rushmore and the Tenenbaums (though not so much in Aquatic, but Wes knows who you are and uses you well), you get the dramatic approval you seek, but framed by your comic perfection. Take away the comedy, and nothing happens.

Maybe I'm way off here. But there was so much life in that blooper reel, and so little life in this movie. Jarmusch says in a dvd extra here, ""It's not my job to know what a film is about. It's my job to make it. It's the viewers' job to tell me what it's about."" Well, say no more. Please tell Jim that this viewer thinks it's about not knowing how to write a well-paced, continually engrossing film. It's about taking a handful of good actors and giving them little to work with. But most of all, it's about using one of the great comic actors now working and watching him be funny all day, except when the cameras are rolling. Then he just sits there and projects nothingness, in a film that could have taken its conceits twice as far in less time.

What a waste. So much more could be done in this turgid bore, but instead we get a kind of college-level faux Bergman flick that uses good music as filler for the dramatic tension that the writer/director just can't produce. It worked ok in Down By Law and some others; here it's just a crime.

Bill, it's your life and you've given us more than enough. You owe us nothing. But perhaps you owe it to yourself to find more scripts that let your true genius come to the fore. You could go halfway again: what if Nick falls in love with his lounge pianist and then finds out she only has a month to live? Just kidding, but man I miss your humor! You're a master at it.

Put it this way: if you can't hit a one-iron but are great with the five-wood, bring it home on the 18th at Pebble with what you do best.

Thanks for the laughs, Bill.

Don is a sad character and time has past him by. He is what he is and suddenly he gets a letter that makes him question who he is, how he has lived his life and that he may have a grown child out there that he doesnt even know about.

Jim Jarmusch's directorial style is very non-invasive. His camera is content to observe than to sneek in and peak within.

Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is at that stage in his life where he is passive about most things. Even when his current girlfriend (The oh-so-beautiful Julie Delpy) decides to leave him, his reaction is one of an inert nature. He just lies down on his couch and takes a nap. Literally.

Even when he gets an anonymous letter from one of his past lovers informing him of a son who maybe looking for him, he is not very roused. It is his neighbor (played by a delightful Jeffrey Wright) who gets excited at the prospect and gets him all planned for a trip around the country to meet all his past lovers in an attempt to figure out who the mother could be.

How does Don Johnston's journey end ? Well, that would be a spoiler. So I will refrain from it.

I can't think of any other living actor that could have played the character of Don Johnston any better. Bill Murray's performance is a study in subtlety. He conveys the inertness, the disappointments, regret and fascinations with minimal histrionics.

In the end you find yourself leaving Don Johnston with the hope that you don't have to live through the regrets that he has.",1186790400,,1473,4.581749049429658
2445083,3,B000BX8R10,"There's no denying Bill Murray is a very funny man. And his recent successes demonstrate he's just as funny now as he was when he was in his prime.

But, if you'll allow me to state the obvious, his recent movies are a lot different than the kind of acting he used to do back in the early 80s. Most of his recent movies involve a minimalist acting in which he is placed in frustrating situations and just uses his facial expressions to show his exasperation. He's the perfect straight man to a crazy world all around him.

As such, he was hilarious in ""Rushmore"", ""Lost in Translation"" ""The Royal Tennebaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". But with all his recent successes, I wonder if he isn't in danger of too many trips to the well. Does there become a point in which all these performances start to seem too much the same?

""Broken Flowers"" was pretty much exactly what I expected it would be. Bill Murray was absolutely hilarious, but I did have the sense that I had seen this movie before with Bill Murray as the lonely old man awkwardly fumbling his way through uncomfortable social situations.

The plot of this movie, by the way, sets up these awkwardly social situations perfectly, if somewhat unrealistically. But I thought the funniest parts of the movie were all in the beginning before the plot really got underway, when Bill Murray was hanging out with his amateur detective neighbor, and interacting with his neighbor's kids. Once the road trip gets underway, the movie kind of lags a bit.

The movie ends unresolved. I can't decide if that's really cool or really annoying. Right now I'm leaning towards really annoying. I know we are spoiled by Hollywood endings, and that open endings are a lot more true to life. On the other hand, if there was ever a movie with a ridiculous Hollywood set-up, this one is it: a man gets an unsigned letter with no return address (and a postage stamp conveniently too faded to read) telling him he had a kid 20 years ago, and because he slept with so many women he has to take a road trip and visit them all to find out who sent the letter. And, for unclear reasons, he can't just come out and ask them if they sent the letter, but he has to try and guess by picking up clues from their conversation. If you're going to give me a ridiculous plot like that, at least give me an ending where I can get closure.",1186099200,2,2373,4.445977011494253

2445086,4,B000BX8R10,"Broken Flowers is about a lonely retired former womanizer played by Bill Murray.  His name is Don Johnston, a ""Don Juan"" if you will, who receives a random letter in the mail from an unnamed former girlfriend.  The letter indicates that Don has a son who has just begun a trip to search for his father.  Don seems somewhat indifferent to the news but given the theme of the film it's likely that he is more tired of life and perhaps a bit self-absorbed than actual indifference, as this news is something that will eventually serve to re-awaken Don and perhaps it gives him just the self-interest he needs to live life with renewed vigor.  In that sense, the story of Don is an existential tale more so than one with a conventional end.  The film offers us means to complete a nice story of a father's union with his son that he's never met.  But director Jim Jarmusch is not conventional and he is too smart to throw such a trivial narrative our way.

At the suggestion and great enthusiasm of his friend and neighbor Winston, Don is convinced that the search for this former girlfriend and the mother of his son is a worthy undertaking.  So he goes off to find five of his former girlfriends at the time his son would've been born (about 20 years ago).  One, Michelle, has passed away and he visits her grave and seems to express more reverence for her than the others...he even tells Winston he loved Michelle and she is the only one he says that about.  Another is Laura played by Sharon Stone.  Don gets to sleep with Laura again and he doesn't seem as surprised as I was when Laura's flirty teen daughter Lolita walks about the house in nothing but her epidermis.  Her overt sexuality probably mirrors that of her mother's and Don seems unfazed by it...great dead pan acting once again by Bill Murray. Dora is another former girlfriend and she is played by Frances Conroy.  Dora seems to contain an underlying regret in her decision to choose a lifestyle completely different than the one she practiced when Don met her.  Jessica Lange plays another former girlfriend who works as an animal communicator.  All three of these women seem to initially react quite positively to Don and are pleasantly surprised to see him, but they are still interesting and unique in their own ways. Finally, Penny is played by Tilda Swinton and seems to be the only former girlfriend that is really disgusted with seeing Don.  I won't reveal how Don's journey ends but I will say that he is given an opportunity to reflect on his life during his travels, and that is something he badly needed.

Perhaps Broken Flowers doesn't ask that we read into the clues as to who sent the letter and if Don will find his son.  If you look carefully in the credits and perhaps watch the movie again you will find some decent resolution to those questions but that isn't necessarily what Jarmusch is telling us about Don.  Broken Flowers is not about a father meeting his son as much as it is about a man becoming a father.

To note further on the film's content, I must say that I always enjoy the atmosphere of a Jarmusch film, as much as they may require a bit of patience.  Some will find it to be a slow movie but it is both fascinating and funny.  In my humble opinion, it also happened to have the best soundtrack of 2005.",1180569600,6,3303,4.47
2445087,3,B000BX8R10,"Jim Jarmusch's comments in the Bonus Features section of this DVD are well worth hearing, as they will temper the stupor one might feel at the end of this typical Jarmusch work. No need for me to supply a plot synopsis, as that's already been done on the opening page of this site. Instead, I'll give you my reactions as a viewer.

I was amused by the absurdities arising from Don Johnston's search for his son (who may or may not exist). Jarmusch tells us that, as he sees it, randomness is a key player in life and in the universe, and so Don's hunt for the mother of his possible child leads him into the sometimes hilarious randomness of these women's lives, as one of his ex-lovers is a ""closet organizer,"" another sells prefabricated luxury homes, another is an ""animal communicator,"" and the last is something of a wild  motorcycle chick living in the country. The ""plot"" tumbles forward like dust drifting in the cosmos. One never knows where any of it will go or why. And Bill Murray, as Don, delivers a generally humorless performance as a man in a comatose state, empty and sad and somehow incomplete, in contrast to his hilarious neighbor Winston, who seems more than fulfilled by his gorgeous wife and six kids. Winston also works three jobs to make ends meet, while Don sits in his lovely home, decorated with beautiful art, listens to sad operas, and stares at his blank plasma TV screen. As was Jarmusch's intention, Murray's performance throws a very large wet blanket over the whole proceeding, as Don is a man without a plan, a sexual drifter who lets randomness take him from one of life's seemingly pointless encounters to the next.

The truth of randomness and mystery in our lives cannot be denied. What gives Jarmusch's work its integrity is his unwavering adherence to this truth in every frame, setup, and script he produces. His outlook, however, grates against many viewers who long to escape into more simple pleasures such as cute comedies, warm romances, and blood-pounding dramas. After all, this escape route has been the traditional role of cinema, but Jarmusch, because of who he is, never really takes it. Tangentially, his movies are hilarious in the way a Kafka story is. The juxtaposing of diversely different elements into the same space makes me laugh out loud.

The other point Jarmusch (and Don) makes is that about time. We know the past is done (and Don learns that through the course of his journey). The future is unknowable. So all we have is this moment, within which we do whatever we can. That's it. Nothing new here, but again, Jarmusch is true to his vision, and again, it's hard to swallow. There are no resolutions, no looking forward, no going back. Nothing can really be learned or discovered except the reality of the moment. Historians, give up your search for the past. Seers, resign your fraudulent predictions of the future.

In this movie Jarmusch framed a shot that forced me to repeatedly look into the rearview mirror of a Ford Taurus, just as Don is looking into the past, but, like the movie, the view was claustrophobic. And Murray's character was numb, lost, and ultimately suffocating. Although this movie could have left me depressed, it left me thinking, thanks to Jarmusch's insights into it.",1180310400,2,3266,4.753086419753086

2445091,2,B000BX8R10,"Ok look, do not get me wrong. I am all into interesting, deep, artistic, and subtle movies. But they have to make sense to me and this just did not make any point whatsoever. I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my day, and you should not feel that when you watch something that is trying to send an important message to the audience.

The acting, subtle and eccentric humor,  dialogue and the nuances in the actors' expressions and feelings were all fantastic, but it was Murray's character that might have contributed to this ""what was the point of all this?"" that I got from the movie. Murray did not change at all, and he should have.

He was portrayed as a drifting, middle-aged character with an empty life, flitting through life from one meaningless relationship to another. Then comes his wacky neighbor-Winston, who was my favorite and felt he was the only thing that made this worthwhile to watch, provoking him to have some type of feeling and passion to a very important quest-finding if that letter really meant that he had a son out there and that maybe his life was not such a waste after all. And although Murray wanted to find his son deep down inside, it felt unnatural and forced and not convincing at all, hence the feeling of meaninglessness I got from the movie.

There really was good material for something very touching, but sadly it lacked emotion. Murray's character felt catatonic and robotic. I understand minimalism but this was not it-In The Mood For Love displayed amazing minimalist acting that was not captured here.

2445092,3,B000BX8R10,"I admire Bill Murray's choices as an actor which doesn't mean that I agree with them.  Instead of going for ""Meatballs V"" or ""Ghostbusters III"" Murray has sought out adventurous directors and interesting characters which doesn't equate to boffo box office.  With the exception of his work with Wes Anderson, though, most of his films miss the mark.  ""Broken Flowers"" is quirky without being humorous.  The central premise of a middle-aged lothario seeking out the possible mother of his son yields few laughs or insights.  You first have to buy into the idea of the taciturn Don Johnston(Murray) as some kind of Don Juan and it doesn't fly.  Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be more interested in the quirkiness of Johnston's past flames.  The women in Johnston's life are more caricature than character.  The most normal woman from Johnston's past is the biker chick (Tilda Swinton)and she's only dealt with perfunctorily.  The film's saving grace is a nice supporting turn by Jeffrey Wright as Johnston's buddy who fancies himself an amateur sleuth.",1175385600,,1049,5.0523255813953485

2445095,4,B000BX8R10,"This particular collaboration between auteur director Jim Jarmusch and Bill Murray seems to be a perfect mix of acting sensibilities and a director's artistic vision. Jarmusch is not known for main stream films though his contributions to the film community, really has brought something different and rare to the industry.

A good example is Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, staring this years Oscar nominee, Forest Whitaker, (The Last King of Scotland) plays a somewhat reluctant assassin with an obsession with carrier pigeons. A very strange film but an interesting one, feeling compelled to unlock the film's message when, in fact, there might not be a message.

This is Jarmusch's style, emotion and visuals must carry the film, words, on the other hand are incidental.

The same could be said about Broken Flowers. Bill Murray's expressive eyes and revealing body language says more than his limited dialogue.

The plot is a simple one: rich, retired and lifeless man loses girlfriend and receives a (pink) letter telling the man that he has a 19 year old son. Feeling self pity over his present break-up with his girl friend, he becomes more lifeless, despite the fact that someone has reached out and stated he has a son. The emotional state of Apathy is a strange disease. Nothing in life matters and the strength to even move from the couch to the bedroom requires a tremendous amount of effort. (This is done extremely well in the opening scenes).

Enter his next door neighbour, Winston, (Jeffery Wright) an enthusiastic man in love with life, not only a father of six, working several jobs, but working on his first crime novel. Johnson's (Murray) only real friend, he coaxes Don to investigate the matter, thus he hits the road, visiting his old girlfriends, in search of his son. This is a great premise for any story whether short story, novel or film.

""Revisiting"" films, plays and novels, is a well used premise for any protagonist to examine their life and make an honest assessment of their past and an opportunity to set their life `right' again. The list is enormous, Our Town, A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, etc. this territory has been well trodden.

Broken Flowers, however, does not follow the realist form of story telling, that is to say, a resolution and awakening from the main character. The Murray character, in most respects, is just as lonely and apathetic at the end of the story, but he at least, reaches for a possibility, (seeing a homeless boy) which was a far cry from his behaviour at the start. This character does transform, though not in a dramatic way, but somehow changes into a lesser form of apathy. The story ends and we wonder what will become of him...and the boy he meets...Will this man continue on this path or return to his lifeless existence...Jarmusch, like most great story tellers, leaves it up to us to decide, finishing the tale, leaving the audience to form their own conclusions.

Broken Flowers is one of Jarmusch's more accessible films though never created for the main stream perspective.

Broken Flowers is not a great film but a very good one.",1171065600,4,3127,4.840823970037453

An anonymous letter he received insists that he does, and that his enterprising son is on a journey to find his father. Don's not so sure; perhaps it's a hoax. Next door neighbor Winston, a wannabe detective writer, cannot resist the intrigue, and sends Don packing to visit four girl friends from his past, all the while looking for important ""clues"" to discover who sent the letter and bore his son.

  We know that Don will visit four former lovers, and that they will now live in extraordinarily different settings. ""It sure is crazy how people change,"" exclaims the husband of a former lover. Laura (Sharon Stone) is a ""closet organizer,"" Dora (Frances Conroy) was a former hippie who lives in a wealthy but sterile suburb and sells ""high quality pre-fab homes,"" Carmen (Jessica Lange) is a former lawyer turned ""pet communicator,"" and Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in rural isolation among angry grease ball bikers. Winston identified a fifth candidate who died, so Don visits her grave too. But this simple road trip develops more subtleties than we might imagine.

  The journey transforms Don. At first he professed wholesale disinterest, then he agreed to go, he eventually becomes interested in these former lovers and how their lives had intersected, and by the end he himself is haunted with finding his son. Also, violent dreams about any number of other women agitate him with unpleasant memories. A second letter from his most recent former girl friend Sherry on similar stationery bookends the end of the film. But to the last of the film you do not know if Don succeeds in his quest, and neither does he. Then you realize that this film is not about Don's girlfriends or his phantom son but about himself, an aging Don Juan who made money ""in computers"" but who awakens to move beyond his laconic, couch-potato existence.

To read between the lines, so to speak.  The same can be said for many of Jim Jarmusch's films.  Jarmusch is the master of lingering minimalism.  Eschewing the ""quick cut"" technique, Jarmusch allows the scene to progress, capturing invariably human moments.  Broken Flowers is a case in point.

Bill Murray plays an ""over-the-hill-Don-Jaun"" who's just discovered that he is a father.  The only problem is that the letter detailing this bears no signature or return address.  Murray, in another simple, spare, slate-faced, but effulgent performance, embarks upon an odyssey which finds him turning up on the doorsteps of old girlfriends in an attempt to discover which of his former paramours was the writer of said letter and the mother of his child.

2445100,3,B000BX8R10,"For some reason I keep watching Jim Jarmusch films and listening to hype around him. Critics seem to love everything he does. I guess he must be a tremendous filmmaker. I really don't see it. Everything in his films is played down to the point of just being boring. Although this film has some great acting, it's no exception.

Although the film is interesting, and the acting is great, the plot is a bit diluted and seems forced at times. Basically, Don Johnston (Murray) receives an unsigned letter from an ex-girlfriend telling him that the son he never knew he had is coming to find him. He receives this letter as his current girlfriend is leaving him.

This leads his best friend Winston into wanting to play detective and sends Johnston to visit each of his old girlfriends to look for clues as to who could have sent the letter.

Each woman's character is remarkable and they provide the high points of the movie. And although Bill Murray is even more sedate than he was in Lost In Translation, it works. The whole thing is very realistic. Sometimes to the point of being realistically boring.

Some things in the film are cliche and some are surprising. For example, having a teenage daughter named Lolita is cliche. Having her parade naked through the living room with a stranger in the house is surprising. Surprises like that help keep the movie from being utterly tiresome, but Broken Flowers still manages to stay pretty uneventful throughout.

On the DVD there's a special feature where Jim Jarmusch talks about his creative process and how creatively creative he can be. Basically, you get to hear him loving to hear himself talk while weird shots of a barn are shown in the background.",1167868800,3,1702,4.717171717171717

Don Johnston gets an anonymous note stating that his 19 or so year old son (it's the first time he's heard of it) will be paying him a visit.  In an orchestrated preemptive strike, he visits his list of ""usual suspects.""

After the second visit, you can predict the personality types of the remaining two old girlfriends.  I give you a 95% chance of getting it right.

Note that the director also makes it impossible to ever, ever figure out where in the heck Johnston (Murray) is traveling to visit his old flames.  No cities mentioned, no signs in the photos, or distinguishing features in the scenery.

I am amzed at how people can suspend their disbelief while watching action movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger overcoming the impossible or even horror films (which I happen to be a fan of), but dismiss movies like Broken Flowers and Lost In Translation as being unrealistic.  Here's a newsflash people...PEOPLE WATCH MOVIES TO ESCAPE FROM THE REAL WORLD.  IT'S OK TO DO IT.  IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANY LESS AN INTELLECTUAL TO DO SO.

Anyway...back to the film...

The plot synopsis is well outlined in other reviews, how ever slanted the reviews might be.  My biggest selling point on this gem is Murray's ability to not over act or overstate certain emotions.  To me, there is a sort of realism you can find in some of his most recent work.  I'm not here to say the film is realistic, but Murray's acting is spot on here.  And for anyone who wishes to lament Murray's older films...are you actually going to try and tell me films like Stripes and Ghostbusters were realistic?  They were fine films.  I happen to love Stripes, but realistic, it ain't.

Bill Murray is fantastic in this film.  He flexes that same muscle that I first saw him display with the film Rushmore.  Since then, Murray has made some fantastic films such as Lost In Translation and Life Aquatic.  These are clearly all films that Bill Murray did because he wanted to.  He knew these films wouldn't be blockbuster hits.  He did these films because they were interesting to him.  Luckily, there is an audience out here who appreciates these films.

I give Bill Murray the utmost respect because he isn't afraid to explore new territory as an actor.  In fact, he seems to be one of the few who craves the challenges of new territory, and it's in that element that he truly shines.",1166918400,2,1857,4.608562691131499
2445103,4,B000BX8R10,"Starring Bill Murray as the protagonist, ""Broken Flowers"" chronicles the story of Don Johnston, who receives an unsigned letter in the mail from an ex-flame telling him to not be surprised should a nineteen year-old man show up at his doorstep, as this would be his son. It turns out this one-time girlfriend had a child with Johnston, but never bothered to tell him as the two had parted soon after the child was conceived.

After conferring with his friend and neighbor Winston, played by Jeffrey Wright, who does detective work as a hobby, he is convinced to pursue each of the five potential mothers, as his interest in finding his son blossoms. After Winston compiles the necessary information, Johnston sets out on the road to pursue each former flame.

In viewing Johnston's visits to these women, with particularly fine performances from Jessica Lange and Sharon Stone, a few things remain consistent. Indeed, Johnston seems emotionally ambiguous, overwhelmed by how much these women and their lives had changed, and, most notably, incapable of directly asking any of them outright if they were the mother of his son, surely owing to his being ashamed of his past.

Messages that the movie conveys are intense and plentiful. One such point is that a promiscuous lifestyle at a young age, which is deemed not just culturally acceptable but expectant of males, is rife with tragic possibilities. Had Johnston been looking for more than mere superficialities in his late 20's or early 30's, he would not know be faced with such a predicament. Also, the fact that he felt true love for the fifth woman he was searching for but did not pursue it is a clear reminder that many put their feelings on the back burner until it is too late to pursue them.

This is a thoroughly top-notch movie, despite the fact that it had not a single laugh; a possible first for any film of Murray's, even considering ""Lost In Translation."" Definitely superb is its cold, honest portrayal of what a life like Johnston's - which a lot of American men lead - can ultimately lead to. So too is the desperate yet understated clarity of Murray's performance.",1165017600,4,2137,4.814713896457766
2445104,5,B000BX8R10,"Bill Murray has been a part of many wonderful films over the years.  Broken Flowers is yet another one.

The movie starts off pretty slow, I admit.  It's slow and boring for about 20 minutes.  However it's supposed to be.  This is clearly a film where you're supposed to sort through a puzzle and put the pieces together pertaining to a storyline about which one of the four (five) women is the mother of a son attempting to visit his father (Bill Murray).

The story picks up as soon as a letter shows up at Bill's house one day, and it says Bill has a 20-year old son.  He doesn't know who sent the letter.  His neighbor tracks down the addresses of all the women who might be the mother of the child (ex-girlfriends of Bill of course).  It turns out there's four (five) women who it might be.  Bill goes on a journey through car and plane rides all over the country to be reacquianted with the four women once again and discover which one is the mother.  Bill gets quite the surprise when he notices that many of them have changed dramatically through the years.

Now, with that out of the way, I thought the movie was hilarious.  It's not supposed to be realistic- the humor lies in the way Bill interacts with the women.  All four of the women turn out to be VERY different personality-wise from one another, and that's where the plot and the humor kick in.  I gotta admit, the scene with the first woman is shocking.  For no clear reason, her daughter walks into the room where Bill is waiting for the mother to arrive completely NAKED!  We see everything, haha.  I wonder what her age was when this movie was created?  She looks younger than 18.  Bill's facial expression was pretty similar to mine when he caught a can't-miss view of her entire nude body!  And when this family is sitting around eating dinner and listening to the Allman Brothers Band ""Dreams"" guitar jam... strange!

The other women are less interesting.  Well we don't even know what the fourth woman is like because that conversation doesn't last very long, but the other two (the woman who can communicate with people's pets (lol) and the one who's a real estate agent) aren't as enjoyable as the first one.  At least, the first woman probably wouldn't have minded Bill Murray being a part of her life again given how they wind up sleeping together.  He should have jumped at the opportunity!  She's pretty good looking.

I have nothing more to add except if you like Bill Murray films, give this one a chance.  It's very good.  Sometimes a slow-moving film can be forgiven when the storytelling keeps you attached and guessing what's going to happen next.

It was the little things that made this film enjoyable: how Don always knew it was Winston when he answered the phone, Lola's pink earrings, the cat on the cusion, the pink typwriter, Don's favorite track suits, and the scenes of the side-view mirror.

A few things bugged me, however.  I didn't like how we never knew where Don was when he visited each woman.  The landscape always looked the same, and I would have at least like to see some geographical differences: desert for one woman, palm trees for another, perhaps Iowa cornfeilds and wind turbines in another.  Also, the ending seemed to leave us halfway though the plot. It is one thing to be left with new questions at the end of a movie, but now we are only left with the same questions that were posed at the beginning.

The music in the film was wonderful, and I loved how it was incorporated through Winston's mixed CD.  I will probably be buying the soundtrack, but not the DVD.  Go to Blockbuster for this one.",1162684800,,1118,4.522388059701493

2445107,1,B000BX8R10,"I had high hopes for this movie. Alas it was a wasted sentiment.

It started off very s-l-o-w. It had a great premise. An aging Don Juan gets a mysterious letter saying he has a son....and he may be looking for him. So off he goes on a journey.

But...can Murray possibly have more of a complete stone face? His complete and total lack of any emotion was appalling. I kept waiting for this charming, charismatic man who seduced woman after woman to pop out. Nope. I thought this was a comedy/drama? No comedy. No drama.

In fact everyone in this movie acted with such stilted restraint in this movie it was painful. Very unrealistic. People do not act this way....

The conversations and time spent with each woman he once had a ""relationship"" or one night stand (we never know as they never once talk about anything much) are boring and again unrealistic. If someone I had not seen in 20 years showed up, I think I might have a couple questions, some animation. Either it be anger or surprise.

One other thing about this movie. It feels claustrophobic. Tight. Constricted. Scenes drag on forever. Shot of him sitting on his couch staring 2 min. Shots of him driving down the road (many of those) with horrendous jazz playing...dragging on for a minute. Just constant boring listless shots. It got to the point if I knew what he was going to do next- say go over to his neighbors house- I would fast forward...knowing it would be a boring drawn out walk over there. I never FF through movies, this one demanded it.

2445108,4,B000BX8R10,"Life is mysterious.  Sometimes bombshells shake us up.  Life seems to be a run toward fulfillment with expectations that frustrate our deepest desires.  Such is the quandry for Don Johnston (Bill Murray) who is a solitary middle-aged bachelor.  His live in lover, Sherry (Julie Delpy) leaves him at the beginning.  He seems slightly startled out of his orbit, but her complaints provide the crux of his situation.  ""You're never going to change,"" she complains.  ""I don't want to be with an over-the-hill Don Juan...,"" and ""I'm just like your mistress, except you're not even married.""  Romance is certainly not elusive for Don ""the Juan"" Johnston, but he seems attached to the experience and not any lover.  He dreamily lives his life through dinner with wine, DVD's, and classical music, sitting almost stupor-like, oblivious to all but the nuances of his surroundings.

It is, however, at this transition that he receives a mysterious pink letter.  In it he is told by a former lover that he fathered their boy who is now about twenty years older and set on a sojourn to find and meet him.  She relates some of his personality traits, but otherwise leaves his son mysterious.  The handwriting is unrecognizable, and the letter is unsigned.  Meanwhile, he makes his best emotional connection with his next door neighbor friend, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), an Ethiopian emigre' who works hard, is an amiable presence, and works three jobs while grooming to be a freelance mystery writer.  His family, including his precocious and cute daughter, Rita (Brea Frazirer) provides a vicarious outlet for Don to the family life.  Don is clueless to any emotional connection to his newly identified son, but Winston, naturally, is fascinated.  After a series of meetings between the two friends, Winston has gathered a whole plan to find the mother and lover who bore Don's son.  Winston's detective sensibilities provide the addresses, workplaces, and MapQuest directions (even a burned soundtrack C.D. for his romantic quest).  At first Don resists, then he is convinced:  It is fascinating and worthwhile to connect with the past.  ""Bring pink flowers...look for red typewriter ribbon and pink stationery...just say you're checking in..."" are the key words Winston advises to make the trek work.

The movie makes emotional connections by rejuvenating Don's spirit at times.  It provides all of the awkwardness one would expect to find in an adult comedy.  Fragments of his former love lives come to roost.  Sometimes it is refreshing (as with Laura [Sharon Stone]), and sometimes it is downright awkward (as with Dora [Frances Conroy] when he finds her married to a man who remembers him as a past love interest, while expounding on trite pleasantries during dinner about how their marriage is so wonderful.)  It is here that Murray shows his comic prowess.  Much of the humor is written on his face (not unlike Bob Newhart, only here he is more subtle with less agitation).  Besides that all of the encounters have that school reunion uneasiness where everyone stares at one another until the other party recognizes the addressed guest.  The four encounters with the would-be mothers provide anything from the sublime to the tragic.

We leave 'Broken Flowers' with tender longing.  The film is not entirely unlike Bill Murray's other acting achievement 'Lost in Translation'.  There is loneliness presented in distant worlds with whimsey and aching trying to break through the pattern of longing and unrealized fulfillment.  Don Johnston may or may not fulfil his inquiry into life's rich enigma's, but Jim Jamusch's directing perfects with bullseye precision this fascinating, easy chair trek.  And, just like 'Lost in Translation,' we too, have been transported by the same sojourn as the protagonist.  Some of the movie is deliberately slow moving with a reflectiveness that deserves the treatment of its subject matter.

2445110,5,B000BX8R10,"This is my first review written for Amazon, and I'm writing it because I feel very strongly about this film.  I've seen it, probably, four times now.  When I finish writing my review, I plan on ordering it so I can watch it again.

I don't love it so much because of a compelling plot, but because with this movie, I find Jarmusch to be perhaps the first filmaker I've come across who really wants to tell a story about how F'd over the men are getting in Western society.  I give the movie 5 stars for being groundbreaking in a way that probably won't be discovered for several more years.

There are two things to consider with my take on the film:  the first is the title ""Broken Flowers"" and what it means.  The second is about the Don Juan myth itself.

The myth is one that changes with time.  There is a Don Juan myth that anyone can look up on Wikipedia and get an idea of what the story line is.  But the myth changes with time and with the culture in the way that it's viewed -- sometimes Juan is a womanizer who uses women, other times it's that he loves women and can't get enough.  Jarmusch is telling the Don Juan myth circa 2006.

It's funny to read about how the take with most people seems to be that Johnston doesn't want to settle down.  Are you sure?  Tell me this:  which one of the frauds and jackasses should Johnston settle down with?  The closet organizer who's raised a daughter to walk around nude?  The animal communicator?  The surrendered wife?  The redneck trash?  Yet he looks longingly at Winston's life, for the truth of the matter is, every woman Johnston's been with has been a broken flower.  He's made his living off of computers, yet he doesn't own one.  We're introduced to Winston through his broken computer.  Simple and elegant plot devices.

Something to notice at the beginning of the film:  As Sherry's leaving she asks Don about Winston and his family, ""Don't you want that?"" she says.

""I don't know, do you?""  answers Don.

""I don't know.""  returns Sherry.

Every reviewer I've seen takes that to be Don's reluctance to commit, yet at the same time, Sherry doesn't know what she wants either.  Jarmusch has tricked every reviewer from the New York Times to the Chicago Tribune into exposing their gender bias.

But the truly huge red elephant in the living room is the idea that Johnston has a son.  Somewhere, possibly, a woman from his past has denied him the opportunity to have a family even while we criticize him for not wanting one.  There is, of course, no criticism for the woman who would do this.  More tellingly, there is no criticism for the denial of her son to have a father.  So, kind reader, is that the broken flower Johnston should have settled down with?  The one who'll dismiss the deep emotions of a man and a boy simply because it's the most expedient?

Nice girl.

Most people tend to think Jarmusch left us hanging, but in fact, if one is willing to REALLY look at this movie, you'll see he answered every question.

The last woman -- Penny, is that the one?  She had his child, she sent the letter and the young guy at the end who wears the same warm-up jacket is Johnston's son.  The pink typewritere gives it away as well as Penny's use of violence by proxy.  Penny is a user who uses one man to beat up another even if it's her own son to wreak emotional havoc on an ex-lover.

Truly a masterpiece movie that every man should watch, and I hope that someday it re-emerges to be what it is.",1159056000,8,3466,4.373626373626373

Murray's soulful, silent stare was way too overused here, cheapening the times he used it quite well in other movies, and after he parts from his neighbor, who is a wonderful character and helped balance out Murray's doleful depression, the film just seems to bottom out and never seems to rise again.

Jarmusch has had much success in the past in following very quiet, interior characters (_Dead Man_, _Ghost Dog_), but here he either overplayed his hand or forgot that what really made those other films work was counterbalance.  Nobody and the French ice cream man are excellent counterweights in the other films to keep things from getting too dragged down, but in this movie, the counterweight is cut away from way too early, and this film suffers for that mistake.",1157414400,11,1049,4.65945945945946

The Dumbing Down of America has obviously succeeded. Murray is excellent and even shows his vulnerability -- he is hardly the great stoneface that these reviewers seem to think he is. By the end of the film we know which of the four women wrote the ""pink letter"" and we see his son. Just because no one states this in so many words makes it appear unresolved -- but it's no more unresolved than most of our lives. Fine performances by all concerned, beautifully revealing photography, a thoughtful script, and an intelligent denouement make this one of Jarmusch's richest films to date.

2445119,2,B000BX8R10,"""Sometimes life brings some strange surprises."" The tagline of `Broken Flowers' goes like this, but for anyone who has been watching the film of Jim Jarmusch, this film's strangeness hardly comes as surprise. The real point is whether or not you like the director's insistence on his own method of filmmaking, which prefers the minimalist approach to the film's material. And I couldn't bring myself to like his method. Well, in short, it was boring.

It is true that Bill Murray again did a fine job as the tired protagonist Don, aging Don Juan-type guy whose simple life-weary facial expressions or poise is always attractive though it is no longer amazing after seeing him deliver dead-pan humor in `Lost in Translation' and other recent films.

To him a letter in a pink envelope arrives, which tells some news about his son. With a help from an officious neighbor played by Jeffrey Wright, Don hits the road to search the sender of the letter, and the road movie-like scenario brings him back to his ex-girlfriends played by Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.

To avoid making vague commentaries about the elusive film, let me talk about the most obvious. Like Spike Lee, Jarmusch has never been good at handling female characters, and he shows it again. It looks as if the director is intent on making them as ordinary as possible, and except for too brief appearance of fantastic and unpredictable Tilda Swinton and the free-thinking daughter of Sharon Stone's character (whose one scene is just jaw-dropping), these female characters including the one played by Julie Delpy are all ciphers. Perhaps you may say this is exactly the point, but then what is the point of Don Juan's visiting these ciphers?

The critics as always hailed this film as Jarmusch's masterpiece, but even they seem at a loss to pinpoint what really makes them think the film `beguiling' `existential' and `subtle.' I agree with all these words as far as Bill Murray and Jeffrey Wright are concerned, and I may feel differently when I'm the same age as Don, but honestly, for me, except the opening and ending parts, the film itself is too remote and detached, too slow-paced and self-indulgent to make me awake.",1154131200,6,2222,4.885941644562334

I sense it, but I can't quite put it into words. Be it some sort of metaphor for the human condition in our world today, or the melancholiness of life...I'm not sure.

2445121,2,B000BX8R10,"**1/2

I have rarely seen a movie handed such a promising premise and yet do so little with it.

In ""Broken Flowers,"" Bill Murray plays an aging Don Juan-type who has had a long succession of girlfriends but never a fully committed, sustained relationship with any of them.  On the same day that his latest love interest has decided to move out on him, Don receives an anonymous letter from one of his former girlfriends informing him that he is the father of a 19-year-old son who may be coming around to look for him.  Eventually, albeit reluctantly, Don decides to go in search of the four women who could possibly have written the note and find out for himself about the boy he never knew he had.

In typical Jim Jarmusch style, ""Broken Flowers"" is all windup and very little follow through.  The preparation for the trip is done with a great deal of style and subtle humor, as Don first balks at the prospect of tracking down the women, but then relents under the persuasive persistence of Winston, his concerned next door neighbor and first class buttinski.  Anticipation is high as Don, filled with curiosity and anxiety, sets off on his journey into the past.  Unfortunately, after all the suspense and build-up, not much happens once he gets there.  To call his encounters with the ladies ""under whelming"" would, in itself, be a masterpiece of understatement.  For in his effort to avoid melodrama, Jarmusch has pretty much thrown out the drama as well.  Yes, we understand that the point is that we never really can go back to the past and make restitution for what we did back then, but does the theme have to be presented in so attenuated, episodic and dramatically inert a way?

This is a particular shame considering the caliber of actresses Jarmusch has hired for the occasion: Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Sharon Stone and Tilda Swinton, not to mention Chloe Sevigny and Alexis Dziena in even more minor roles.  All these women are given so little time on screen that they are unable to develop any truly memorable characters.  What a waste.  As Don, Murray plays pretty much the same zonked-out, near-catatonic fatalist he did in ""Lost in Translation,"" but he does it so well that he keeps the movie interesting even when it is faltering and trying to figure out where it wants to take us.  With the subtlest possible facial expressions - the ever so miniscule tilt of an eyebrow, the barely perceptible half-smile, the sardonic twinkle in his eye - Murray conveys thoroughly what his world-weary character is thinking and feeling.  It's another breathtaking performance from a man who began his movie career as a broad comic and will surely end it as a first rate dramatic actor.

Despite the sag in the middle, I must say that ""Broken Flowers"" ends on a brilliantly sustained high note, a long scene involving Don and a young vagabond that hints at how great the movie could have been had the whole thing been played at this level.  The inconclusive ending and the lack of a clear-cut resolution goes a long way towards redeeming much of the rest of the movie as Don comes face-to-face with the emptiness and meaninglessness of his existence.  It's a fine finale to a deeply flawed and ultimately unsatisfying film.",1153180800,3,3236,4.724199288256227

Actually, he put me to sleep exactly 20 minutes after these broken flowers started to wither (with LOST IN TRANSLATION, I slept almost the whole movie).

Well, with ""Broken Flowers"" I am pleased to say that Jarmusch is returning to form. I still don't like it as much as I enjoyed his earlier films, but for my tastes, ""Broken Flowers"" is the best thing he's done in years.

Bill Murray gives a wonderful performance, as do all the various women he meets up with along the way. Jeffrey Wright gives a fine performance as Murray's neighbor, and Jarmusch deserves major points for using some of the great African, ""Ethiopiques"" music on the soundtrack.

2445128,4,B000BX8R10,"In Broken Flowers, Jim Jarmusch creates a vague physical world without clear sign posts to alert, explain, or direct either his characters or his audience to time or place. Don Johnston (Bill Murray) follows a schedule to retrace his love life (to identify the mother of a boy who may be his son), a schedule detailed by someone else, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), to fill a void that someone else-- Winston--thinks is ruining Johnston's life.

Every detail that Johnston might use to identify himself within the world has been co-opted or obscured. Endlessly fumbling with a map, Johnston must rely on the directions provided by Winston; the road signs are blurry, as are the license plates; even his name is obscured by its similarity to Don Johnson's--another clich detective, and note how both Johnston and Johnson are vague, watered-down versions of Don Juan.

Every conceivably useful piece of information he finds seems too clich to help him triangulate purpose or meaning--at first. The first two women Johnston revisits are, in fact, pure clichs--one stereotypical cut-out of a widowed redneck mother and daughter, and another of a repressed, one-time-hippie yuppie living with an overly enthusiastic husband. Obviously, Johnston cannot learn anything about his life from these clichd ex-girlfriends.

But as he continues along the path backward through his life, the other women from his past become increasingly original even to the point of absurdity--and ironically remain just as blurry, as vague. As Johnston continues this mission--again, a mission created, defined, and organized by someone else--he begins to lose his distance from the past. However, his memories are uncertain, too different from reality--they cannot be trusted. When he realizes that he has lost his claim to both the present and his own path, he is filled with an urgency to discover any outcome at all.

After viewing Broken Flowers, I immediately rented another Jarmusch flick: Dead Man, another brilliant movie. I'm beginning to understand what Jarmusch is about: as we move through our lives, we initially believe we are following the unique destiny given to us; eventually we believe we are caught in the flow of forces beyond our understanding. Jarmusch builds his films in a way that the meaning achieved by the resolution moves past the motivations of characters, and those of the filmmaker as well. Whatever punishments or rewards that may await our own ending will transcend our own expectations, our own sense of justice, and will have nothing to do with our own hopes.

This is every penetrating film to watch; it talks about absences, of vanished illusions and disappointments, a retrospective journey in search of certain clues in order to restore or rebuilt certain unfitted pieces.

Back into our memories, there is not so much to find: the people we loved and ourselves change according the interests and the years.

But perhaps, the most interesting aspect to remark is the visible existential boredom of this living wreck, who is forced to initiate a desperate and troubling search of a teenager, product of love affair.

The urban jungle: airports, airplanes, buses and mails, filled of empty words without importance, seem to accent still more the vast silence underlined by inexpressive dialogues; trying to find a door exit that leads to nowhere; old love adventures: All those women of his past intend to live or survive and somehow represent an extension of his ego: Sharon Stone, a very attractive widow with a daughter named Lolita (a posthumous homage to Vladimir Nabokov' s novel and Kubrick's film); a mind reader of animals; an unhappy and  narrow-minded wife and an outlaw woman who lives in the suburbs conform a mirror image of himself.

The incisive and corrosive shot is implacable: five intersections, five women, five fingers that represent the hand of fate. The film possesses a visible dark poetic flight; the process of edition itself is part of the narrative speech.

Two points to remark: the central personage  was extremely flat; Bill Murray is simply an extension of the previous character in ""Lost in translation"" (I think about Jeremy Irons who looked perfect for this role) and second: Jarmush is not Antonioni.

But if you can watch this film just for the pure joy of watching the collision of the baggage of the past meeting the present and the fun that ensues, then you will really appreciate this wonderful film.

Jarmusch unravels the illusion of ""Don Juan"" as Don faces the fact that his past lovers are either uncomfortable with him or he's uncomfortable with them and none of them are forthcoming with any information as to whether he's left a trail of kids behind.

Until your middle aged and reflect on the past and realize the choices you've made are what molded your present situation, AND see that perhaps you could have made better choices, then this film won't make any sense to you. Jarmusch beautifully photographs (and scripts) the accident that is 21st century ""middle age"" for a man who's fought his way through a quagmire of womens lib, empowerment, equality, the pill, feminism and every other end of the 20th century battle of the sexes that has left the modern male alone, childless and confused.

Jarmusch's style is to just points his camera at the characters and let this reality unfold... subtly - and it's unpredictable, funny, sad, scary, absurd, awkward and beautiful all at the same time.

Like reality, don't expect a happy or easy ending. By the time the final scene rolls, neither the view nor Don knows if he really HAS a son or not, if he really WANTS to have a son or not, or if every time he turns around and sees a young man about 19 years old - is he going to wonder... is that kid mine?

For all around fun and unexpected surprises in human dynamics, Jim Jarmusch is a modern master. Plus he scores huge on three major cinematic points in all his movies:

1. his choice of actors with their dramatic and textured faces is always surprising.

2. his choice of soundtrack is always hip and cool

3. he films the US roadside like no one else

I was fully unaware that when you feel like total s**t you're supposed to sing about it.  come on, ladies and gentleman, you've got to be smarter than I give you credit for.

now, on to the film itself.

Written and Directed by (personal favorite) Jim Jarmusch, Broken Flowers is the story of an aging Don Juan (Murray), Don Johnston, ""Johnston with a T"", who, on the day he's left by his latest love, receives a letter in a pink envelope, informing him, on pink paper in red ink, that he has a son, the letter is unsigned and there is no return address.

Don's neighbor, the seemingly Raymond Chandler obsessed Winston (Jeffrey Wright) jumps at the bit quicker than Don does.  Winston urges him to go on a trip to find the women who could possibly be the one who wrote the letter, Don refuses to make a list of the women who could be the mother, but does it anyway.  Then Winston sets up an entire investigation for Don, car rentals, motels and everything, and again Don refuses to go.  He leaves the next day.

What follows is a journey of discovery.  Not who the mother of his son is, or if he even has a son, but the discovery that he, Don, is totally alone.  This theme is enforced by the seemingly meaningless shots of Don in the car, by himself, and the final shot, where he stands in the middle of a street that seems as if it should be flourisihing with people, but infact he is alone.

The acting, all around, is top notch, as is everything else, from the soundtrack (Jarmusch knows how to compose a soundtrack better than Tarantino ever could.), the cinematography and the locations.

I know Murray is no longer the young pup filled with energy. He's an old timer now in Hollywood. With such a treasured past of movie roles on his resume, I can't help but get excited when I see a new movie of his getting ready to hit the movie theaters. I really had to scratch my head with his ""Lost In Translation"" (2003). Slow, boring and more importantly disappointing were not strong enough words. Now, 3 years later, ""Broken Flowers"" follows in the same vein. Slow, boring and again disappointing. How long can we sit and watch the main character drive his car, sit on the sofa, read his mail, stair out the window (without dialogue or any background music)? I agree with one Amazon reviewer here that the ""pre-teen nudity scene"" was unneccesary and ""disturbing"". Not to mention the abrupt ending... it just fades to black in the middle of a scene. After watching Murray's latest 3 bombs (""Lost In Translation"", ""The Life Aquatic..."", and now ""Broken Flowers""), I'm absolutely starting to think the days of Murray's comidic genious are well behind him. For me, ""Broken Flowers"" is a total downer and a very bland and bitter pill to swallow. Two stars for some interesting cinematography and some of Murray's dialogue with the neighborhood kids... but that's pushing it.",1148342400,3,1610,4.9010989010989015
2445136,3,B000BX8R10,"Seriously, This film COULD have been good because the characters were all interesting enough,some a little weirder than others,but then....I thought the player had messed up because it ended in the middle. Then I realize that WAS the end !

I actually did get very caught up in the story.

He gets a letter , unsigned ,that says he has a Son , and his detective wannabe buddy takes a list of names of ex lovers , maps him out a route , motel rooms etc. (He has to travel what I assumed is long distances between ex-lovers) and he is off on a quest to find the Son , who we find out in the beginning (from the pink letter) is also looking for Dad.

I still can't figure out why all the guessing on his part.( Why not just straight out ASK these women if he fathered a child by them,Instead it is a big guessing game.) And

the way we were left just HANGING ,The director must have wanted us to come to our own conclusions , ( either THAT or he was doing MAJOR drugs :)

We are left with all the pink clues,and I would've thought it was the trailer trashy girl ( because of the pink typewriter)  but her reaction at seeing him would have been WAY off base after HER getting ahold of HIM. So in my mind that eliminated HER.

But yet, the kid that shows up at the end I DID feel was supposed to be his Son...then another kid drives by in a car to confuse us FURTHER

I have seen movies end abruptly , but this takes the cake.

My guess is that the trailer trash girl who had him beat up WAS supposed to be the Mother of his child after all, and the kid who he bought the sandwich for wasn't the Son (because his reaction was genuine shock and he ran away ), and I feel that the kid that drove by in the car probably was just a ""symbol"" that Bill Murray would just never know for sure  but my guess is as good as anybodys.

Any comments on anyone else's conclusions would be appreciated. I know a lot of the more modern movies now don't have the ""traditional ending"" and we are left to explore the possibilities on our own , but dammit! I want an ANSWER.

Although the letdown really sucks , I still give it 3 stars for the acting. Anyone else interested in sharing thier thoughts on a conclusion here? Thanks!",1148169600,2,2205,4.102325581395349

As this persona looks up a handful of flames from 20 years back in an attempt to figure which of them may have had a child by him, he finds that his former women too are damaged or wacked out, no matter if they are married or single, rich or poor. The only people who seem to be happy in this film are Murray's neighbors from Ehtiopia. The husband especially is full of life, for all his five kids and three jobs. So what, the film seems to ask, is wrong with America? Very low key, but a terrific soundtrack.",1146268800,,695,4.3538461538461535
2445142,2,B000BX8R10,"I've always liked Jim Jarmusch's films.  Quirky, meandering stories used as settings for atypical characters who live on the fringe of normal life, and don't seem to have any idea where they're going.

I didn't like this one.  Yet, I can't get it out of my mind.

Often there's one line of dialogue in a film that gives the theme away.  In this film, it occurs when the lead character, played by Bill Murray, finally meets the young man he believes is the son he never knew he had.

The young man asks Murray for some philosophical advice.  Murry tells him that all we have is the moment.  For Murray's characher, every moment is empty, pointless.  Was this Jarmusch's existential statement?  If so, pop psychology beat him to it.  Anyway, no one said ""the moment"" has to be this meaningless.

Bill Murray delivers his role in his usual ""acting"" style.  Dead man acting. Expressionless.  He sits dead center on his sofa, motionless, eyes blank as he stares into his void.  Everyone else he knows goes on living their lives without him.

He's supposed to have been a Don Juan whose inability to commit leaves him with no one, and nothing.  I find it very hard to believe Murray's character could have ever been a Don Juan.  What woman in her right mind would be in love with such an empty man, so lacking in charisma?

Of course, he could learn to embrace life, as the women he knew have done. Not this guy. He passively passes on every opportunity.

This story went nowhere.  New characters are introduced and then dropped.  No continuity.  No development.  Maybe that's the point.  This is a character who's completely detached from life.  He has nothing to give.

I guess I keep thinking about the film because I felt cheated.  I was waiting for some deeper insight, or at least, some interesting character development.  It never came.  Like the main character, all I got out of this film was a pointless, empty experience.

If he doesn't care, why should we?",1145750400,5,1961,4.613372093023256

2445145,5,B000BX8R10,"I saw this beautiful sleeper of a movie back to back with ""A History of Violence"".  ""Broken Flowers' was a perfect antidote to a cynical re-hashed Western about a 'gunslinger' revisited by trouble.

The sad thing is that so many people thought that ""Violence"" had very deep things to say about America.  I think that Jim Jarmusch knows more about America than David Cronenberg, and I'm grateful.

""Broken Flowers"", as others have remarked, has the character of a waking dream.  Bill Murray's  shipwrecked Don Juan emerges in the beginning of the film from a cave-like bachelor's lair and walks into the sunshine of real life, looking (as always) rumpled and frowsy and not entirely awake.  Through a sequence of gorgeous days, he pursues the chimaera of an unknown son that he may have sired twenty years earlier.  He makes a tour of old acquaintances, and realizes some bittersweet lessons about life, such as, ""be careful what you wish for...  that son who's looking for you may not be the idealized version of yourself that you would like him to be...(if he indeed does exist).""

The places that Murray visits seem like classic slices of Americana, archetypes that exist in our collective unconscious:  the little yellow house with junk in the yard,  the huge tomb-like McMansion where Murray finds himself being served a 'happy meal'.

I loved this movie!  It's a movie populated with actresses and actors who are allowed to 'act their age'.  It's got a great score, and a great look.  It will make you feel good about life...life with its inevitable disappointments, still beautiful and still worth living.",1143936000,14,1611,4.911111111111111

And shine they do. Once again Bill Murray, as Don Johnston, is understated, and once again it works, allowing the rest of the cast to flesh out their richly idiosyncratic characters. The journey is Don's, but the film really belongs to the actresses who play his former lovers. Don sees himself, and the world, differently through the eyes of each of these four women. The beauty lies in the subtleties: the glimpse of nudity that Laura's (Sharon Stone) daughter un-self-consciously allows Don, the desperate looks Dora (Francis Conroy) shoots to Don over dinner with her obnoxious, soulless husband, the hostility that seethes under the surface of Carmen (Jessica Lange), or Don's strangely unsurprised reaction when he's attacked by Penney's (Tilda Swinton) backwoods companions.

Item the third: A camera nerd is one who freeze frames DVDs to see what cameras people use. Jim Jarmush uses a Contax T3. Very nice.

Item the fourth: I enjoyed the movie a lot, but the ending was a letdown. Note to film makers: if you are not going to reveal the mystery in the end, it is cheating to put up a mystery in the first place.

2445149,4,B000BX8R10,"I knew I'd see a lot of negative reviews for this movie, as it is slow and not much happens plotwise... BUT the whole point of the movie is contemplation, looking backwards.  The lead finds himself at a life double crossroads in the first 5 minutes, left alone by a younger woman and seemingly unsure of what to do next, then finding a mysterious unsigned letter in the mail stating he has a long-lost son.  From that point on, Murray's character is shell-shocked and lost, he drags himself across the country I think because he has no idea of what else to do - he simply does everything his neighbor\friend tells him.

The main theme I got out of Broken Flowers was ""what might have been"" - each house he goes into, he stares wordlessly at objects and pictures, you can almost hear him saying to himself ""this could have been mine, I could live here, if not for..."" and obviously the cause is his emotional detachment.  Each visit is shown as being more dreaded than the last, by the end he obviously doesnt want to go, but he does it, almost like scratching an itch.  Think of the situation yourself - if you could meet 4 people you dated 20 yrs ago today - there would be a lot of uncomfortable silence and dazed afterthoughts, there's no high drama, car chases or explosions involved.

The visits are suitably bizarre and tense, the randomness of events very true to life.  Murray is quietly charming, a few times he gets laughs with a mere sideways glance or re-statement of another actors line, I thought he did a great job.  The 4 female supports were all good, although Jessica Lange needs to find a new surgeon, she's barely recognizeable after all the work she's had done.  Or maybe she should just face the fact that she's almost 60 and its time to stop playing 40-somethings.  I still cant believe she played Ricci's mother in Prozak Nation, give me a break.  But aaanyhoooo.....

The ending will leave many unsatisfied as it does not resolve the main plot device, but in a quiet, contemplative sort of way it's quite fitting storywise and powerful.  4 stars, this is a touching film that I really appreciated.",1142899200,5,2122,4.552631578947368

If you take out the scenes of Bill Murray driving, sleeping or speaking in one-word sentences, you'd be left with about 10 minutes of movie, and even that would be too long. I mean, the whole premise of the movie is ridiculous. Bill Murray gets a letter from an exgirlfriend saying she secretly had his son 19 years ago, but she leaves no name or return address. Bill's next door neighbor finds the addresses of all his old flames, then Bill goes to track them all down in person to solve the mystery. First of all, if the neighbor could find all the addresses, couldn't he just see which one had a 19-year-old son? Problem solved. Second, now he's got all their info - why not just drop a phone call? I guess that wouldn't allow for the film's numerous scenes of silent conversation and awkward moments. And even if you buy the premise, why would you even care what happens to a main character that is an unlikeable blank slate. Man, this movie sucks - I wish it was a person so I could punch it.

There were many beautiful moments in this film, but the ending, with Don in the crossroads, was the most beautiful of them all.  It epitomized the entire film for me: him always faced with many possibilities, and never knowing which direction would be the right one that would lead him to what he was searching for.

Likewise, the idea of Don looking at every boy of a certain age and wondering if it was his son....  there's a justice in that.  Not a nice one or a fair one, but a right and proper justice all the same.

I'm not much of a Bill Murray fan, and I swore off Julie Delpy after ""White,"" but I was intrigued about this new Jarmusch movie with Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton (who, btw, was EXCELLENT in her very brief and all too short role).

I love how it starts out as a light, pretty dry comedy, and slowly turns almost tragic and sad, yet remains charming througout. I love movies like this, and I wish Jarmusch and Murray had gotten due Oscar nods for this. As much as I loved Bill in Lost in Translation, he is far more deserving in this film. Although the story is not as interesting as Ghost Dog, and the style and wit isn't as cool as Down By Law, this film stands alongside both of them, and above some other works by Jarmusch. Its easily his most accesable film, as far as mass audiences go, so its a shame that come awards season it seems to have been forgotten. If I was a critic, four stars. But I'm not a critic, so its just really good.

as far as movie-goers who seem to feel that if they don't catch on to something, then the rest of us are ""faking it"" all i have to say is shut-up.  its one thing to not like the film because you can't see what the rest of us see, but just because you're unable to enjoy films that don't involve fallus and flatulance jokes, and are so antsy that if the scene lasts more than 10 seconds you get bored, don't condemn those of us who can appreciate something different.  some movies are slow.  Jarmushsch films certainly can be.  i'll accept reviews that don't like it, who thought Bill Murray didn't perform, and that Jarmusch isn't funny or entertaining, but drop this ""if you like it, you're lying"" b.s., because it just how low your intelligence is.",1141430400,4,1544,4.292096219931271

This one turned out to be a fresh highly original and beautifully acted film, equal parts humor and dramatic narrative, a movie with a heart and a brain. Bill Murray is in peak form here.

Although the plot ostensibly concerns four past romantic relationships of Murray's, nothing is revealed about them when he travels to see these women.  In the absence of dialogue and detail, the viewer is free to make up their own story about what happened in the past as well as the protagonist's present perspective on it.

He, along with a friend, plans a trip that will devolve into his past and will examine his relationships with his old flames long after they have ended.

Jim Jarmusch is notoriously known to have films that are slowly done. People say that his films move at the pace of a snail. Well, in this movie, his style really finds a niche here. The film is slow and really detailed when it comes to the shots and the pacing. I have had no problem with that. His films, Down By The Law and Dead Man, were impressive. Jarsmuch's writing skills are solid too, although there is not all that much dialogue in the film.

Bill Murray's performance was sluggish, brooding, and depressing yet brilliant in a way. He takes a role that is extremely complex and lonely and makes it his own. He literally amazes us and makes us locked to the screen with his performance. He was fantastic.

I have been a big fan of Jim Jarmusch after I watched Dead Man late one night in my room, with no light on. I felt for the characters in every films that he has made. His slow style won't suit anyone. In fact, some people probably won't have the patience to watch a Jarmusch film.

Directed by Jim Jarmusch

This may be one for the ages, for it shows Bill Murray, now aging but not aged enough not to be able to play a Casanova (Don Juan in this case-are the two the same?) who has fathered a child with one of his ex-girl-friends, but has no idea who that might be. He received a letter in a pink envelope, typed in pink letters, informing him that he has a 19-year-old son, who will soon show up at his door. After a brief scuffle with his present girl-friend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), who walks out of the door on him (just dropped in to say good-bye), he shows the letter to a friend of his, Winston, a wizard with computers (Johnston had made his money in computers himself), who soon finds out, from the names of former girl-friends given to him, where they are and by what means they can reached. He buys Johnston air tickets, rents cars for him, and gives him maps and detailed directions, and sends him on his odyssey to discover his son-through finding who of the women was the mother. He has to look for a pink typewriter.

Johnston first thinks this is all crazy, but he is compliant and, under his dead-pan faade, really curious, he embarks on his search. He looks worn out and uncurious, to begin with. But the surprises of his trip find even this stoic soul stunned. Holding a bouquet of pink roses, he starts knocking doors, looking for the four women. First, he finds Laura (Sharon Stone) in a shack somewhere in a remote neighborhood resembling a trailer park, and the first thing that comes to his attention is Sharon's teenage daughter, who comes to the door scantily dressed, lets him in, and tells him her name is Lo ... short for Lolita. ""Lolita?"" asks the amazed Johnston (even he is capable of shock)-and a moment later he ogles at her when she comes into the room, a cell phone stuck to her ear, completely naked. Soon Sharon arrives, she recognizes him, and tells him her husband had been killed in a race-track smash. She now works, arranging ... closets. But she is happy to see him, and, naturally, they sleep together. No pink typewriter though. Next morning, when he takes his leave, Lolita thinly clad in her undergarments, stands next to her mom, and waves goodbye as he drives away. The road has is compensations.

His next stop is at a prim housewife's suburban home, where Dora (Frances Conroy) receives him with a lukewarm smile, looking at him as if he were secretly deranged, but invites him in, and as soon as hubby, Ron (Christopher McDonald), arrives, Don is invited to and stays for dinner. They tell him are in real estate, but plan to go into gold, when the market slows down. Their dinner is bland and tasteless, but Johnson endures his passage through this Charybdis by forcing himself to swallow it. Dora has no children, and the couple imply they are content to look at each other. No result, however, can be obtained regarding the object of his search. The next stop marks the real comedy of such encounters, for he finds Carmen (Jessica Lange) busy with her clients-dogs mostly-for she is a canine therapist but who calls herself animal communicator. Before he sees Carmen, Johnston has ample time to sit on the couch outside the office, ogling at the receptionist's (Chloe Sevigny's) thighs, exposed to the absolute maximum,  a torment to a still hormonal Don Juan who can't help looking at a tempting sight thrown in his direction. But Jessica is busy, her appointments with dog owners pile up on her, and she absolutely refuses to even have a cup of coffee with the intruder, no doubt thinking him crazy, unaware that she is crazier than him. She walks to her car, repeated refusing opportunities to talk. The receptionist sweeps her hips as she urges her to return to the office, and Johnston, despondent, drives away in his rented Taurus. He calls Winston soon and tells him he should be doing this in a rented Porsche.

Stoically, but visibly growing  more anxious, he drives through a forest of tangled back roads, in search of the fourth woman in his list, Penny. He asks two menacing rednecks near a shed, where she might be, and they inform him she is inside, behind ""the screen door."" But when she sees him she screams at him, and they run to her rescue-and one of them lands a swift right in his left eye. Before he goes unconscious, he sees a pink typewriter a few feet away in the bushes, as if thrown there as a piece of junk. When he comes to, he finds himself in the mist of a plowed field, at the back of his car, his left eye black and blue, his brow swollen. He drives away wearily, stops at a flower shop to get to get another bouquet of flowers (which he has carried all along), and an obliging salesgirl gives him some things to band-aid his brow. Soon he flies back home. But wait, a young fellow (Mark Webber) follows him to his neighborhood, and Johnston, now really curious, and beaten up, offers the youngster, who seems hungry, a sandwich. After a brief talk that gets him nowhere, he tells the young man that he might be his father, and the youngster calls him crazy and runs away, like he has seen Don Juan in hell.

Johnston's search comes back full circle, with no results-except for his black eye. This may be the imagery Jarmusch was after. That, and the pink letter, the pink typewriter, and the pink flowers suggest a psychological turmoil that Johnsotn's dead-pan expression does not show. Why a pink letter? Who sent it?  The answers are not given, and the movie remains open-ended,  for there is no conclusion to the search, and Johnston's yearning for fatherhood remains unfulfilled. But the unstated message may be: what is fatherhood? Is it the desire to acquire a son whom one has never brought up-to accept him as a matter of conscience, or even mere curiosity? Johnston shows himself far from inhuman and behind his mask of apathy-he sits in front of his plasma TV, alone, at nights-there may be real paternal feelings stirring. But the movie, by remaining inconclusive regarding the search, may also be saying that he is reaping the rewards of his profligacy in his youth (or even in middle age), for, to him, women were an object of pleasure, not of real affection or kinship of spirit. What-who-is a Don Juan? History and legend-and opera  and literature --show him as a man of conquests of literally thousands of women (""mille tre"") who succumb to his inordinately sexual charisma. This, today, would appear as a travesty of humanity-just as the brief reference to Lolita (amoral creations by Nabokov/Kubrick) may indicate. Johnston is a nice enough fellow and sincere in his search for his son. But his final punishment is that he may have to spend the rest of his aging life in ignorance and isolation. Is that not some kind of hell? And, if I remember correctly, isn't pink one of the colorations that painters, poets, and other literati (not to mention religious writings) the color ascribed to hell's locations? Yes, yes, it's red, but pink comes close to it-uncomfortably so. Think of a pink hell. Whoever sent the letter devised a perfectly diabolical revenge.",1140393600,2,7107,4.623613312202853

The viewer is left with the uncertainty about whether Don Johnston will maintain his emptiness and regret, or take a more fulfilling path at this major crossroad in his life. I think that the ending is Existential--highlighting the reality of how it is hard to know what path each of us will choose for ourselves.

He has hardly any reaction to a letter telling him he may have a son, except to show it to his next door neighbor and apparently only friend Winston, whose energy and interest get Bill moving, at least to the point of deluding himself that his son is actively looking for him.

At least a couple reviews use ""elliptical"" to describe the movie. Elliptical means a ""vague"" circle. More accurately, the movie is a circumvolution. At the end we are at the beginning. Nothing is resolved, but the protagonist (Don Johnston played by Bill Murray) is changed. Hopefully we, the audience, are changed as well. Chekhov is the benchmark for such style, which always leaves the audience dissatisfied-- and thinking.

Some talk as though a comic in a dramatic role is some sort of reversal. Instead, Murray shows the commonality of comedy and drama. In both the actor plays the audience to elicit a strong reaction. To properly play drama requires keen wit and a sense of humor. To properly play comedy requires a sense of the dramatic. Murray is great!

The pace (painfully slow) is deliberate and brilliantly done. We wish it would move faster, but we keep watching. The pace makes the audience feel the mood. It creates an incredible tension.

The movie is full of visual gags and various metaphors. ""Don Johnston"" is an obvious contemporization of Don Juan, and there is a lot of play on its coincidence to Don Johnson. Jarmusch really draws the audience into the story. The audience is primed to be alert for clues: boy things, typewriters, pink, etc.

Everyone gives solid, stellar performances. Every actor plays an integral role. Every scene is critically important. Many scenes are real gems; worth watching the movie for are: Girls on the Bus (Jennifer Rapp & Nicole Abisinio), Lolita Miller (Alexis DZiena), Carmen's assistant (Chloe Sevigny), Carmen's cat (?), Sun Green (Pell James), The Kid (Mark Webber), and Kid in Car (Homer Murray). Supporting actors shine bright (Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton). The real genius pulling it all off is writer/director Jim Jarmusch. Awesome!

We share Don Johnston's quest. We end at the beginning, knowing nothing new for certain-- still wondering. Yet, the journey is not a waste.

Synopsis: Aging womanizer gets an anonymous letter telling him he has a son, and that the son is looking for him.  Womanizer embarks on a series of vignettes displaying various female stereotypes (Trailer trash slut, hippie-turned-yuppie, woman with flakey career, biker/hillbilly)

The movie employs cheap visual tricks (all the women like pink, all the young men who might be the progeny of the aging womanizer wear variants of the retro-tracksuit that he wears) and ham-fisted ""symbolism"" (At one point a slutty teenage girl named ""Lolita"" wanders around nude for no apparent reason.)  This is in between pointlessly long shots of... well, not much really.

I'd like to say I won't ruin the ending for you, but if you watch the first half hour you've seen the ending.  Nothing is resolved, nothing is explained, no character is developed beyond the cardboard cutouts we start with.  Does he have a son?  Was the letter mere flummery? Can I get my money back even though I watched it?

At the core of the movie is a cynicism typical of young film students.  Everything is pointless, everything is dark and empty.  No hope.  No hope.

2445175,5,B000BX8R10,"Okay--I'm going to warm you about this but I want you to go ahead and see this wonderfully written and directed film. This movie has no ending. I think it would be considered a post-modern ending--which means you will be frustrated when the credits suddenly pop up.

I was disappointed as anyone (honest with themselves) would be in the lack of a clear cut ending especially when Don looked as though he might have found his pot of gold.

After what he goes through and learns about himself in this story maybe he will face his emptiness and do something about his life. I would highly suggest psychoanalysis as he clearly has issues with women and being able to love them.  He has apparently spent most of his life objectified them as a young man but free love seems fine when you're in your 20 and 30's but it bites you in the butt when you're middle aged and have no family of your own.

We don't know what ultimately happens to Don Johnston (NOT DON JOHNSON!) played absolutely superbly by Bill Murray. This man who I loved in the mid 1970's and was so goofy on Saturday Night Live has totally knocked me out in LOST IN TRANSLATION and now BROKEN FLOWERS!  Where are his Oscar awards???

Anyway, Don, a successful computer expert (living in a state of perpetual depression and emotional numbness) receives an anoynomos letter telling him that he has a 19 year old son but has not been given the name of this son or the mother.

Our immoblized pathetic man--once a Don Juan--is not at all sure who the mother might be. Thanks to Winston, his neighbor and only friend--a talented detective wannabe--Don is conjoled by his Winston's ""motherly"" orders to go on a journey in search of clues to find out who the woman he impregnanted might be and if he indeed has a son.

On his trip he mets up with 4 very different women from his past (two being Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange).  I won't say much more about this except that this journey contains much tension, humor, and a lot of surprises as the lives of these woman have a way of going their own unusual paths. The 4 are all very diverse women.  I specially liked the woman who became a real estate agent and her annoying husband. Her body language says it all says a multitude of what she is feeling.

This is definitely a dark comedy but it is very quirky and amusing. I had personally never heard of it until I found it at my local library.

I have been a Bill Murray fan for decades.  I've enjoyed his comedies, and I've enjoyed him in dramas.  Why anyone would enjoy watching him in scene after scene of sitting in his living room staring into space, or driving down the road, is beyond me.

Its really baffling since this movie has such a good premise, and such a strong cast.  If I could give it less than one star I would.  It was boring and pointless.",1139184000,8,769,4.328671328671328

I would group it with movies like ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Rushmore"".  Sometimes it goes a little too slow and ""arty"", but for the most part it is smart and intriguing.  My husband even sat down to watch it, and he rarely sits still through movies!  It is definitely worth a watch (even though I wasn't thrilled with the ending)!",1139184000,4,593,4.70873786407767
2445178,4,B000BX8R10,"I didn't really care for LOST IN TRANSLATION--I thought it was bland and pretentious--but I was thrilled that Bill Murray got an Academy Award nomination out of it.

I'd seen him in 1984's THE RAZOR'S EDGE many times (check that movie out!) and knew he was capable of more than Hollywood was getting out of him.  His supporting role in 1982's TOOTSIE, still one of the greatest comedies of all time, was an early clue.  (His convictions in 1980's disastrous WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM were right, but everything else in that film was a wreck).  Even 1988's SCROOGED showed a great range.

So I went to BROKEN FLOWERS with a lot of hope.  Murray's great in it, if a little understated.  The whole movie has that slow, steady feel to it.  I just wish the film would've included a little of Murray's sense of humor.  It would've explained how he got all these women in the first place (which is never addressed, honestly) and it would've been another aspect of his ""loss"" as a person.  We're left to decipher his somber expressions to see what's going on inside.

The film has moments that teeter just at the edge of inspired lunacy--not slapstick or crude laughs--but surreal and emotional moments of hilarity.  The appearance of ""Lolita"" perked up the audience I saw it with and generated some real laughs.

The rest of the cast is great.  If you run out for popcorn (or blink), you'll miss Tilda Swinton (the Ice Queen from THE CHRONICLE OF NARNIA).  It was fun to see ""Nurse Charles"" and ""Jeff Slater"" from TOOTSIE do a scene together, as unnerving as Jessica Lange was in that scene.

Look carefully in the end credits for ""Homer Murray"" for another clue about the son.  It's actually Bill's real-life son.

This movie is really about the unseen forces connecting the past and present.  Jung called it synchronicity.  In ""American Beauty"", it was that plastic bag floating upward, seemingly having a life of its own.

Don Johnston's journey is riddled with seemingly connected clues, but in the end, he doesn't find the answer.  Or does he?

  1)The ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER acts as a kind of Cliff's Notes for those who prefer not to drink the Jarmusch kool-aid in that all the information one needs to talk superficially about the film is condensed to 2 minutes.
  2)GIRLS ON THE BUS is a delected scene that works as a cartoon.
  3)FARM HOUSE is a 4 minute documentary of JJ explaining his methodology.
  4)BROKEN FLOWERS START TO FINISH, the coup d'oeil, is a wonderful 7 1/2 minute short that consists of most of the film's clapboard shots spliced together. It will seem like just so much paint drying to anyone who has not enjoyed the film.
  5)THE FILM ITSELF takes THE BIG LEBOWSKI one step further. Where the Dude (Jeff Bridges) was a laid-back, California Dreamin', reluctant detective, here Don Johnston (Murray) is so loathe to act that he lets his neighbor, Winston (Wright), not only do most of the sleuthing but also provide him with an itinerary along with the necessary plane tickets, hotel accomodations and rental cars. Johnston complains, ""Couldn't you have rented me, like a Porsche or some car that I might really drive. I'm a stalker in a Taurus!""

Uh uh. He's Don Juan as a bump on a log. Don Wan with no outward manifestations of desire. Does he really want anything? Should he? Should we?

There are but 2 instances when he is moved to actually do something. Both involve flight.
  A)Alone with a teen-aged girl named Lolita, with provocation, he leaves in a panic.
  B)A young man runs away from him, with provocation, and Johnston gives chase.
  That's it.
  His one act of forward motion driven by genuine desire is rewarded with... bewilderment.

Most of the film is just talk and transportation. Inertia is such an operating force here that many of the more resonant scenes are just Johnston on a bus, Johnston on a plane, and Johnston driving. These, along with scenes straight out of STRANGER THAN PARADISE of planes taking off and planes landing, are eerily more interesting than they have any right to be. At one point Winston assures Johnston, ""Look, don't worry. We're still going to solve this mystery."" Weirdly compelled to agree or disagree, we forgive such irony.

Bill Murray's odyssey in the Jim Jarmusch film ""Broken Flowers"" takes us on an exploration into this past world. The vehicle is his quest to find the truth about a possible unknown illegitimate child. And it makes us ponder our own relationships - their durability, their place in the context of our finite lives, and the role of continuity beyond.

Along the way we peer into the many forms of Americana, while sexual nostalgia occasionally bursts into the present.

Bill Murray takes his Lost in Translation, emotion dead character to further extremes.  It's almost like watching the Weekend with Bernie, dead guy, visiting his four ex's of a certain time to find out which one sent the letter telling about a son he has sired twenty years before.  Don Johnston is sort of a Don Juan, but we never see his talents as a Romeo, but rather, we see the results.

Go ahead; suddenly show up at an ex-lover's door twenty years after the fact.  What's their reaction?  Sharon Stone jumps back into bed with him.  Her daughter is Lolita.

2445186,3,B000BX8R10,"The postal carrier drops a stack of mail, including a curious pink envelope, through the mail slot in the front door just as Don Johnston's (Bill Murray) girlfriend is moving out.  Later, Don, an aging, lonely, and confirmed bachelor who has made a fortune in computers opens the anonymous letter and reads about the alleged existence his illegitimate son.  Don's neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), an amateur sleuth and a professional busybody, reads the type-written letter and is convinced that Don must learn who sent the letter.  So, armed with a travel itinerary, an admonishment from Winston to bring flowers and to look for pink things and a typewriter, Don visits five women who could have possibly given birth to Don's illegitimate child and would have written the mysterious letter.

Don begins his journey mapped out in detail by Winston, and shows up unannounced at the homes of the suspects, each a woman who is more a ""broken flower"" than the one who preceded.  While the tone of each of Don's meetings run the gamut of emotions, from humorous to painful to just terribly sad, he collects meaningless clues like a painting of pink flowers, a pink business card, pink stationery, a pink motorcycle, and even a pink typewriter.  However, as Don finishes his journey, he appears no closer to an answer, an answer he arguably never wanted to find.  When a young man, who may be the approximate age of his supposed progeny, appears, Don must face a cold and hard possibility.

What is it about men's desire (or willingness) to revisit decades old relationships?

A commentary on relationships and loneliness, ""Broken Flowers"" is an curious, nicely done film, but it is more ambiguously artsy than it is sheer entertainment.  Bill Murray is interesting as Don, but Murray's portrayal of the lead character is similar to his depiction of Harris in ""Lost in Translation.""  Obviously, Murray was extraordinary in ""Lost in Translation,"" but the likeness in the character poses questions about Murray's range.  Audiences learned that Bill Murray is much more than a comedic actor, but there still may be some debate whether Murray can navigate the nuances of dramatic roles.  Believe it or not, it's Jeffrey Wright who provides the comic relief in his interpretation of the quirky Winston.  Wright is solid, and both director, Jeremy Jarmusch and Wright himself effectively develops Winston so his actions and behavior throughout the film are quite credible and, at times, funny.

One particularly cute scene is that in which Don is having a tea party with one of Winston's daughters.  Don asks the young lady a whether her father is really one of a number of famous private detectives, ""I think you father's real name is Sam Spade.  Is it Sam Spade?""  After each question, the young lady more and more emphatically and more and more endearingly responds in the negative.

The broken flowers themselves, two of whom are played by Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, respectively, are interesting.  Sharon Stone's character, a widow of a stock car racer and a mother of a ""Lolita,"" (whose name IS actually Lolita), is the first of Don's destinations and is only moderately broken.  Lange's ""animal communicator,"" is divorced, quite strange, and clearly more emotionally damaged than the first two.  By the time Don visits the animal communicator, the audience wonders, ""How much worse can it get?""  Chloe Sevigny is appropriately peculiar as the secretary of Lange's character and apparently a broken-flower-in-training.

In all, ""Broken Flowers"" is a not a bad video store rental if the renter is in the mood.  However, the story and moral are a little esoteric and Bill Murray's performance is ordinary.  As such, the ""Broken Flowers"" is only slightly better than average.",1138060800,4,3774,5.027331189710611

His acting in Broken Flowers mirrors director Jim Jarmusch's laid-back direction perfectly.

The always reliable Jeffrey Wright is excellent as Winston who does all the leg work and pushes his friend to solve this mystery. He is the proactive counterpart to Don's reluctant protagonist - a hallmark of Jarmusch's films. In typical fashion of all of the director's movies, Broken Flowers is an understated comedy and this is evident in the way Winston and interacts with his family - they clearly love each other but Jarmusch doesn't hit us over the head with it.

Broken Flowers most closely resembles Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise with its long, static takes and deals with a protagonist's inertia. Don is an aging Don Juan, a bit of a sad sack stuck in rut with no direction in his life and the anonymous letter he gets in the mail motivates him into action. Or rather, he stumbles into an adventure. A large weight of regret hangs over Don and this overshadows his entire journey. True Jarmusch devotees are wondering throughout if this film will be open-ended a la Down by Law or have some kind of closure like Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Ultimately, Broken Flowers is about a journey that forces Don to re-examine his life and his relationships with the women in it.

""Girls on the Bus"" features more footage of the terminally chatty teenage girls that Don encounters on a bus.

""Broken Flowers: Start to Finish"" is an amusing outtakes reel that takes us through the entire movie.

""Farm House"" features behind-the-scenes footage with Jarmusch talking in voiceover about the random nature of life and how he likes to have scenes in his movies where you don't know what's going to happen next.

If you did like Lost in Translation, and you do like David Lynch films, I think you may enjoy the movie. By the David Lynch comparison, I mean don't look for a neat, tidy, feel good ending. Just watch the film, and enjoy the experience of observing the characters. Nothing is really resolved at the end of the film, but that's OK.  One of the editorial review mentioned seeing the movie as a ""poem"", and I think that's better than any analogy I might try to come up with.

I would recommend a Zen-like approach to watching this movie. There is a Zen saying,""Before Zen, chop wood, carry water; after Zen, chop wood, carry water. The difference is in your Awareness.  Enjoy the symbolism in the film.  Enjoy the understated emotions. Enjoy what's being left unsaid as much or more than what's being said. It's the space between the notes that makes the music.

If my last paragraph makes sense to you, I think you'll like the film. On ther other hand, if you're thinking ""what in the h*ll is he talking about"", then watch Mission Impossible II and enjoy yourself.",1137974400,5,1244,4.506666666666667

I was quite suprise considering all the glowing reviews when the movie was first released into theaters.  Murray plays a depressed late lifer. I'd say midlife except Murray is actually 55 but looks more like 65 in this film.  His character Don Johnston has seemingly lived (and continues to live) the life of the carefree playboy sleeping with various women (most of whom are 20 years younger).  Now he gets an anonymous letter claiming he has a son who is trying to find him.  There is very little laughter, mostly serious moments. This may sound crazy but at times I got the impression Murray was bored with doing this movie.

Sharon Stone's career must be at rock bottom to bag a cameo role in this stinker.

If you can read something into this film, then you must be able to devine tea leaves or stare at a monotone paiting and see Breugel.

Jarmusch, who has given us such off-beat classics as Stranger than Paradise and Down By Law, seemed at a loss as to how to present suburbia, which made me wonder why he wanted to go there in the first place.  This movie plods along at its ineptitude pace as Murray, as Don Johnston, searches out a handful of girlfriends from the past, after receiving a mysterious note that he has a grown son.  We get cameos by Julie Delpy, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange and an unrecognizable Tilda Swindon along the way, which shows you just how much cache Jarmusch has these days.  However, the stilted dialog barely holds the vapid scenes together.  About the only excitement is a brief peep show by Alexis Dziena as ""Lolita.""  I kid you not.

Really strong cast all around, from Jeffrey Wright (who supplies some awesome Ethiopian pop music) to Sharon Stone (in a non-bimbo role for a change) and Jessica Lange.  As with most Jarmsuch movies the soundtrack is excellent.

I won't bore you with a plot synopsis, because many others here have done so already, and also because this movie is really not about plot at all.  It's more about the absence of plot which is really the plot of all our lives...IF we are awake and aware and open enough to realize it.  Yes, there is a strong Zen flavor to this film.

His new mantra appears to be ""the more obtuse, the better"" as he has moved from bad to worse in his last several movies. He plays the same comatose, walking-through-life-without-purpose vegetable that he started in Lost in Translation; with less connective tissue. Murray's ""Don Johnston"" is hardly a convincing Don Juan, as he walks through life with a perma-frown borne from a life with less purpose then EuroDisney in France. The best part of the movie is when Murray's character gets knocked out flat. It's just-desserts for the formerly funny and talented actor, who has sold the last few years of his life for trite material in the pursuit of respectability.

Every trace of that subtle sly humor that made ""Lost in Translation"" such a wonderful movie is gone and we're left with a character that's so flat and lifeless and dull that at times it's painful to watch. So much so that watching Murry between takes in the Special Features, (Which, curiously enough, manage to be even more pointless and annoying than the movie itself.) it almost seems as if you're watching a completely different actor. Visually this is a beautiful movie and there are some good performances. And the core of the movie, the center section, is watchable. But the beginning seemed poorly written to me and the ending was just annoying. (And no I don't mind a movie that makes me think. I ""still"" can't figure out how I felt about the end of ""The Crying Game"" but it didn't annoy me.) (Okay maybe it annoyed me a little. Still...) The one thing that bewilders me (Well, okay one of many. My confusions are legion.) is not that Jim Jarmush makes such bad movies (And I have to admit here that the only other thing I've seen by him is ""Coffee and Cigarettes"". Still, as far as I can see he's 0 for 2.) but the fact that so many critics praised this.

Maybe my taste just isn't mature enough.

2445199,2,B000BX8R10,"Bill Murray has nearly become synonymous with introverted, angsty middle-aged men in the past decade. ""Broken Flowers"" is his latest film on that theme, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. This time, Don Johnston (Bill Murray), a computer mogul without a computer in his home, receives a mysterious letter just as his live-in girlfriend (Julie Delpy) is leaving him. The letter, composed with a manual typewriter on pink paper, is from a woman claiming to have been Don's lover 20 years before. She announces that Don has a 19-year-old son, who is on a road trip in search of his father. But the letter is unsigned, leaving Don to wonder who might have borne him a son or if it is a hoax. Don's neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) wonders more than he does, and convinces Don to set out across the country to visit the 5 women who could have been the mother of his child.

Bill Murray can certainly play aloof angst. It isn't the extent of his talent, but it is unfortunately sometimes the extent of his characterization. Beyond that, ""Broken Flowers"" isn't about anything. The characters seem tailored to fulfill their particular roles, which are inconsequential, not to impress anyone as genuine. I kept hoping Winston would reappear, because he is the only character who  seems to be among the living, even though he's not credible either: A working class man who lives in a modest home next door to a multi-million dollar house, speaks with a charming accent, works 3 jobs, and is a meticulous and efficient travel agent for no pay. The film spends an inordinate amount of time staring at Don in his living room or in his car. At least 20 minutes worth of  unnecessary shots should have been trimmed. ""Broken Flowers"" has just one moment of genuine emotion when Don is overcome by exhaustion and self-pity. I thought about giving the film 3 stars, but that one moment is the only thing I could find to recommend it, and that isn't enough.

The DVD (MCA 2006): ""Girls on the Bus"" (1  min) is additional conversation between the 2 teenagers in the bus scene. ""Broken Flowers Start to Finish"" (7  min) follows the filming from scene 1 to 63, skipping some scenes, by showing the clapboards for each scene. There are a few bloopers and a lot of clapboards. ""Farm House"" (4 min) features behind the scenes footage of the farmhouse scene while writer/director Jim Jarmusch speaks about the film's themes and his intentions. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.",1137283200,14,2535,4.75

He gets a mysterious pink letter in the mail with no name of return address on it saying that he has a son and he reads it to his friend Winston, played by the always amazing Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Syriana). Winston then wants to investigate this letter more and he tells Don to write down all the names of the women he dated back then. Winston then finds the names and sends Don on a trip all over the place as Don visits the women from his past. First up is Sharon Stone (Basic Instinct, Total Recall) who has a teenager named Lolita, played by Alexis Dziena (Havoc, Wonderland). Dziena bares all in one scene which might make some people look away. But that doesnt ruin the film.

He shows zero feeling when he is acting, there seems to be nothing there....gather to guess that in his heyday, he may have done too many drugs or something.

""Broken Flowers"" is an attractive production loaded with talented actors and graced by a delightful soundtrack, but Bill Murray plays the same detached, morally ambiguous character with zero emotional range we have seen in other films, and all four women he encounters on his quest are broadly stereotyped -- neither nuanced nor sympathetic.  I give the film credit for telling a reasonably absorbing story without relying on violence or (much) sex to advance the narrative, and I was not troubled by the ambiguity that apparently irked some viewers, but the contrast between this and ""Sherman's March"" was like seeing a Cezanne still life compared with a paint-by-numbers bowl of fruit.",1137024000,11,988,5.326923076923077
2445203,2,B000BX8R10,"Nobody does comatose middle-aged angst better than Bill Murray! Just like Lost in Translation, Murray plays to the hilt the role of a rich, jaded, washed-up, older ladies' man. The only problem is that he's boring to watch. This could have been a decent movie if the character of Don Johnston actually had a spark of mischievous life left in him, and I know just the actor who could have pulled it off brilliantly: Jack Nicholson. Sure, Jack's fat, ugly, and middle-aged, but he still effuses like crazy his ""bad boy"" pheromones. Murray's deadpan demeanor might play better in the role of a corpse in a wake.

As for the story, I did not like the inconclusive ending - it seemed pretentiously avant-garde. A decent conclusion might have redeemed the plodding plot. And why did all of Don's exes have to be messed up in one way or another? Is it asking too much for just one of them to be happy and normal? Wait, I get it! All those beautiful, delicate, messed up women are the broken flowers, and our Don Johnston, aka Don Juan, is the cad who broke them, right? But the movie never shows us how these ladies were broken, and it never shows Don as a cad. Don is boring, depressed, rude, and unwilling to make a commitment - just like that other middle-aged twit in Shopgirl, and just like the real-life Don Johnson, come to think of it - but he seems harmless enough.

And just how did Don remember the names of five women he had brief affairs with from twenty years ago? And within one day his neighbor could find the current addresses of all five from a quick search on the internet? Wow, I'd like to learn that trick. And of course all of the ladies happened to be home whenever he came unexpectedly knocking on their doors. Oh, and give me a break with the oh-so-highbrow literate humor when the half-dressed nymphet teenage daughter of one of Don's amours introduces herself as ""Lola, but my friends call me Lo, but my real name is Lolita."" (And she hasn't got a clue about the book or movie of her infamous namesake) That's just too funny - and it makes me feel so smart that I got it. Even more highbrow humor could be found with numerous people mixing up Don Johnston with Don Johnson. Did Johnson pay to have his name repeated, like the embedded ads for Ford Taurus and MapQuest in this film?

More seriously, Don is a poor communicator and he never seems to feel empathy for anyone. That explains why he's alone, but it doesn't explain how he continues to attract an endless stream of beautiful, younger women. Since he leaves Sharon Stone with a very satisfied smile after a sleepover tryst, I guess we're supposed to assume that Don is a great lover. Don may appear to be bored, depressed, and rude, but he's red hot in bed! Some of Don's remarks are insensitive and border on cruel. The best scene in the film is when an oafish biker punches him in the eye for being rude. I wanted to punch him, too.",1136851200,,2913,4.4309701492537314

the movie goes nowhere afterwards.  Just the repetition of

the 4 plane/car trips, and the quirky old-flames that add

almost zero humor and just detract from any focus the story

had.  The ending is somewhat sensible (as it shows he's learned

nothing), but also lackluster.  In total, although Murray

is excellent at playing the cynical, nothing-to-lose character,

But if you were wondering how far Murray can go in divorcing himself of his well-known mannerisms and such, then ""Broken Flowers"" would say the answer is pretty far.

Murray plays Don Johnston (pay attention, people, there is a ""t"" there), who apparently made enough money from computers to feel comfortable sitting on his couch and watching his latest girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy) walk out the door.  For all we know her exit could write ""fini"" to his life, but then he gets an unsigned letter that says twenty years ago he fathered a son who might, at this very moment, be searching for him.  So the letter constitutes fair warning, but makes no impact on Don.  However, his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is intrigued by the mystery, compels Don to make a list of all the women who could be the mothers of such a child, and then arranges a trip for him to check out the possibilities.  All Don has to do is go on the journey.  Giving the women pink flowers to gauge their reactions and seeing if they have a typewriter (the letter was typed on pink stationery) are Winston's helpful hints as he sends Don forth into the void.  He also promises to keep an eye out for any 19-year-old boy who shows up looking for his father.

So it is that Don takes off to look for the woman who may be the mother of his child.  The candidates are Laura (Sharon Stone), Dora (Frances Conroy), Carmen (Jessica Lange), and Penny (Tilda Swinton).  Don must have been some sort of Don Juan (or even Don Johnson) two decades earlier because otherwise it would be pretty hard to connect the dots given that quartet of women.  As Don goes from one station of his journey to the next it is hard to tell if it is making an impression on him because Murray's performance is going for a minimalism that is quite impressive because it forces you to focus on what little he gives us to try and glean what is going on in his mind.

Writer-director Jim Jarmusch (""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai"") makes it clear that the journey is more important than the destination.  After all the best case scenario here is that only one of the women on his itinerary can be the writer of the letter.  You may well watch ""Broken Flowers"" from start to finish wondering what it is all about, because Jarmusch's approach is to show instead of tell.  Some will find that maddening and others compelling, and your tolerance of this film could well be how much you like Bill Murray.  Fortunately, most people like him a lot, and that could well be the foundation for allowing his performance to be your conduit to this film, because without him it does not stand a chance.",1136764800,2,2943,4.460820895522388

2445208,3,B000BX8R10,"Know what you're getting into with this movie:  it's a Jim Jarmusch film. Jarmusch makes avowadly ""minimalist"" cinema:  often in his films, we know next to nothing about the protagonists, and a long scene might be the protagonist sitting at a bus stop with some kids playing nearby.  The idea is that the more you know about a character and the more conventional the story line, then 1) you'll predict what is going to happen and 2) the meaning will be instantly familiar and hence the cinematic experience is a failure.  Jarmusch insists in a dvd extra that his films succeed because 1) you never know what is going to happen in a scene and 2) the meaning is imposed by the viewer.  He's right, and I respect the hell out of him, and I mildly liked the movie, but it seems to me that the price you pay for minimilast cinema is 1) protagonists who are deeply uninteresting and, well, one-dimensional (since they are just a point for projection), and 2) some really slow and boring scenes, in which, for example, we'll get a very slow pan of a rhinestone encrusted cell phone belonging to one of the characters.  Yes, I can impose on that all sorts of interesting thoughts, but at some point, I didn't care what would happen next and I yawned a lot.  This is not a ""Bill Murray minimalist film,"" this is a ""Jim Jarmusch minimalist film"" and you have to be prepared for an experience like going to a gallery or museum, not seeing a movie.",1136764800,6,1436,4.458015267175573
2445209,1,B000BX8R10,"This movie, quite frankly, is terrible.  (I'm not a hater of art-house films, either - ""You, Me, and Everyone We Know"" was bizzare, but enjoyable.)  I saw it with two friends, and we all agreed that it was the dullest movie we'd ever seen.  Imagine how shocked I was to see that 89 percent of critics on Rotten Tomatoes liked this film.  They were calling it a ""minimalist masterpiece"".  Apparently not making viewers so bored that they want to stab their eyes out with a fork is no longer a requirement for good cinema.

The premise of the film is promising: Bill Murray goes on a tour of old loves, trying to figure out which one of them, if any, is the mother of his son.  Somehow the filmmakers manage to suck all the promise out of this and make it dreadfully boring.  The most glaring problem is Murray himself, who spends the entire film looking depressed and/or bored.  (I don't consider maintaing the same mopey facial expression for an hour and a half to be good acting.)  Some people are calling this a small, sensitive, personal film; for me it never worked on that level.  I wanted to like Bill Murray's character, but he never showed even the slightest glimmer of personality.  Apparently he's dated some interesting women, but what they ever saw in him remains a mystery.  Another problem is the incredibly slow pacing of the film - seeminging a third of the screentime is devoted to Murray's character driving through nondescript countryside, staying in nondescript hotels, and flying in and out of nondescript airports.  It's a bit like watching you aunt and uncle's vacation video - only without the good parts.

Encouraged by his neighbor, Winston (who actually has a personality - compared to him Murray's character looks like a wooden indian (although come to think of it, Murray's character is so lifeless he would probably look like a wooden indian when compared to a wooden indian)), Murray is supposed to be looking for ""clues"" to solve the mystery of his supposed offspring.  Clues there are, and the camera lingers over them lovingly, as if the director thinks he's being clever - only they never point to anything.  This movie could've been a kind of  mystery story, with the clues meshing together at the end to create a clever whole - only that never happens.  The mystery is never solved at all, and the end of the movie is completely unsatisfying.  I'm not some sap who demands that every movie have a schmaltzy happy ending, but I spent the whole movie hoping against hope that all this dullness might add together to mean something.

Another problem - and a disturbing trend I'm seeing lately in so-called ""good"" movies - that this ""comedy"" is actually not funny at all.  A running joke that Bill Murray's character is named Don Johnston, which sounds like Don Johnson.  It's not funny the first time, or the fourth, or the fifth.  Humor can cover over a multitude of sins, but in the movie there is none.  I don't think I laughed out loud even once.  Don't buy this movie.  Don't rent it.  If you do, it may be the dullest 105 minutes of your life.",1136764800,18,3083,4.627992633517495

After reading the rave reviews of this film, I decided I had to see it. It has been described as ""funny"" which it is hardly so. Yes, there are instances that made me laugh out loud, but they are few and far between.

I understand that the filmmaker took a minimilistic approach when creating this film. Yes, sometimes the ""less is more"" philosophy can work out rather well. Unfortunately, in this film, it served in a negative way by portraying characters that are entirely one dimensional. The quirky friend, the slutty ex-girlfriend, the crazy ex-girlfriend, the lonely man, etc. - none of these characters I could relate to, nor did I ever develop feelings for them. Thus, I never got emotionally involved in the film. The line between reality wasn't blurred to the point where I got ""into"" the movie and felt attached.

The premise of the movie was a good one. It's unfortunate that the potential of this film, with the excellent cast and interesting concept, isn't ever fully realized.",1136764800,6,1312,4.670995670995671
2445211,2,B000BX8R10,"Here's my question. Bill Murray's character in BF, Don Johnston, is clearly established as a hermit who doesn't like to move from his couch, even when his current girlfriend is leaving him. So he gets an anonymous letter from an old girlfriend claiming that he has a son who is looking for him. So . . . . .(1) if the old girlfriend has Don Johnston's current address, why doesn't she just give it to the son so that he can come visit, or (2) if Don discovers that his son may be looking for him, why the hell would he leave the house and go looking for old girlfriends? Wouldn't most guys who are established couch potatos merely stay put and let the son come to him???????

Sorry, but I never bought the premise of this movie. I'm not trying to be overly picky here because I'm a HUGE Bill Murray fan and there are some truly great moments here. Who knew Sharon Stone could act? And Jessica Lange is dynamite. The Francis Conroy bit goes too long and Tilda Swinton is too briefly on film. Jeffrey Wright is hilarious.

But the script needed more depth and more of an arc for Bill Murray to follow. Worth a rental, but keep your expectations lowered.",1136678400,5,1151,4.348837209302325

2445213,4,B000BX8R10,"Jim Jarmusch continues his exploration of the human plight with BROKEN FLOWERS, a story he both wrote and directed, and this time he examines the psyche and the consequences of the Don Juan complex.  In doing so he offers a quiet meditation about choices and their reverberations and leaves  many thoughts open-ended, a definite tribute to the intelligence of his viewers and followers.

Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is a middle aged bachelor who has devoted his life to being a success in computer work, all the while being a lothario with countless women used as  sexual partners over his lifetime. His most recent paramour Sherry (Julie Delphy) has just left him: 'You make me feel like a mistress and you're not even married!'.  He now lives alone in Anywhere, USA, his only friends being his next-door neighbor, novelist Winston (Jeffrey Wright) and his wife Mona (Heather Simms) and five children. Don receives a pink envelope in the mail, no signature, no return address, informing him he has a 19-year-old son  who may be out looking for him.  Don's affect is flat: he has no idea of his parenthood or the identity of the mother.

Winston is curious, takes the letter in hand and begins detective work to find out whom the mother might be.  In a matter of days he has located four prospects from a list Don reluctantly and fuzzily makes of girlfriends from 20 years ago, makes all the travel arrangements, gives detective type advice, and  sets Don (Juan) Johnston off on his journey with instructions to greet each of the four with a bouquet of pink flowers.  The four women are a disparate group: Laura (Sharon Stone) and her au natural daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena) where he pauses for a physical dalliance; Dora (Frances Conroy); animal communicator Dr. Carmen Markowski (Jessica Lange) with her sexy office assistant (Chlo Sevigny); and Penney (Tilda Swinton) whose fellow bikers beat him.  Don returns home, without having a clue as to who sent the letter or has the son.

Back at home he receives a second pink letter which he turns over to Winston: case unsolved.  He remains a lonely man, befriends a young lad (Mark Webber) at the thought he may be the son, but that too leaves stories unresolved.  Was the lad his son,  had he met the mother, or is this all a concoction for a novel by his best friend Winston?

Jarmusch leaves the ending to the audience.  He has created enough characters with whom we can identify and understand and then just leaves it there.  The cast is excellent, with Bill Murray's Don being the finest interpretation of his career. Each of the cameos is brief but fully realized and allows each of the actors a divergent role from their usual casting.  Though promoted as a comedy this story is more of a meditation on lust, desire, loneliness, and failure to connect.  It is a fine little film.  Recommended.

If you think I don't ""understand"" strange movies and must be force fed plots and subtext please understand I LOVED The Life Aquatic.

Broken Flowers on the other hand is simply a shell of the above, coated in an armor of DULL. Each encounter Murray has seems worse than the one before it and by the time the movie rounds the three-quarter mark you will be saying; ""Only a miraculous ending can save this mess of boredom."" The funniest part is... the ending is quite possibly the worst part of it all. Not because I'm some mass-market-shlub that is not enlightened but because I'm not pompous enough to pretend to want to THINK about this movie any more than necessary after it was over. You can sit and try to pry symbolism out of this movie if you want but since the performances and dialogue were subpar, I suggest moving on with your life.

Broken Flowers was indeed as bad as Lost in Translation. It wants to be a movie about awkward circumstances but instead BECOMES an awkward circumstance. The movie was simply poorly cast and lacks any sort of passion, the rest follows suit downhill. I am giving this two stars because the premise is at least good, and Bill was satisfying. I instead reccommend: Punch Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, the Life Aquatic, About Schimdt, or even Sunshine of the Eternal Mind; these movies are in the same vein, and they actually... bleed.",1136332800,11,1540,4.596363636363637

The original title must have been Dead Flowers because the DVD extras have it on the cut scenes, Pay attention to the conversation when his latest girlfriend leaves in the beginning and they talk about family. She leaves the day the letter comes and the flowers on the fireplace are Pink. At the end they focus on them as dead and dyeing. I think after watching the film and thinking a bit, which to me is a good film when it makes you think. I give it a 3 because Bill Murrays character just has little emotion and pretty much is the punching boy here (literally) and it felt he was walking through the role till the end he picks up speed. Yet in the end it must depress him even further how he had wasted his life knowing some of these woman really loved him. Ah the classic successful and lonely plot.

Don's nextdoor neighbor convinces that he should go on a road trip to interview the possible candidates for the author of the letter and comes up with the names of five woman, four living and one deceased.

The rest of the movie essentially is about Johnston's quest. Bill Murray is a terrific actor, having great timing. He is joined by other good actors, particularly Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange; but their fine performanes do not keep this movie from dragging. The last movie I rented was ""The Brown Bunny."" I am sorry to say that this film reminded me a lot of more of that dog than I would have liked. Some of the driving scenes are almost as slow.

Then he receives a mysterious pink letter from an anonymous former lover who informs him that he has a 19-year-old son, who may now be looking for his father. Prompted by his neighbour Winston (Jeffrey Wright) who has a penchant for unsolved mysteries and has tracked down the names and addresses of four possible mothers from Don's long list of ex-girlfriends, Don reluctantly begins a journey to visit each of them and try to figure it all out... Great setup. You think you know where this is going - aging Lothario revisits the past and learns something about himself - and are even looking forward to the journey. The problem here is that Jarmusch does very little with it and does it so tediously that most audiences are likely to be more frustrated than engaged. The pacing is truly mind-numbing. So much of the running time is consumed by repetitive transitional sequences, most of which add absolutly nothing to the story or character, nor anything more to the atmosphere than what was established by the opening scenes, that they seem little more than excuses to hear the soundtrack. They're used to such an extent that they infect the entire film with an artistically unnecessary lugubrious tone. Thankfully, the performances compensate. The ex-girlfriends - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton - are all excellent, doing wonders with very little screen time. Much has been made of Murray's minimalist style. It works, to an extent. Although it does make you wonder how such a stick-in-the-mud ever managed to attract such a coterie of women, or what he used to be like and what hideous event changed him. But we never find out. We never find out much of anything in this film. In the final moments, all we are left with is a banal regurgitation of Buddhist philosophy - a philosophy of the Eternal Now that Don, by the way, seemed to be living quite perfectly when he was sitting alone in his living room, doing nothing, being present, in the semi-dark. Arguably, the (non)resolution of this (non)story is realistic in the extreme, but it's a very unsatisfying ending. This may well be what Jarmusch intended: the answer to our future doesn't lie in nostalgia for an unrecoverable, impenetrable past; and the magic is in the silences, in the unsaid. Fair enough points. But they don't make for a very good movie. ""Broken Flowers"" is quite enjoyable on one level, but not the deeply satisfying film you might have expected. Think of it as ""About Schmidt"" or ""Sideways"" or ""Lost in Translation"", but without the growth. Or the hope. Or most of the laughs.

2445221,5,B000BX8R10,"Jarmusch is mushy at times but a limpid and clear mush of sorts. An old  bachelor , which means (typically American) an unmarried lady's man, is titillated by life : one more girl friend goes away, and a letter arrives from an old anonymous girl-firend announcing the existence and eventually popping up of a 19 year old son of his. He is dumb enough to get on the road to check his old girlfriends to try to find out the one who is playing with his nerves, because the idea of having a son is definitely trying on his nerves. And of course he ends up in a blind alley, or rather a set of five blind alleys all dead. That's Jarmush. These  bachelors  of the libertine generation of the 60s, 70s and 80s are just misfits when they reach the ripe age of sixty. They have a luxurious house, they have a good income, but they have nothing affective, nothing sentimental. They are a wasteland left on furrow for fifty years and there is like a crazy dream that maybe they would enjoy a son or a daughter, or whatever that could look stable till the final departure. Jarmush is a sentimental undertaker who buries even the slightest and smallest illusion we may have about a possible redemption in this world. We were abandoned a long time ago by all gods that we imagined existed and we find ourselves, soulless, selfless, godless, and so on, in other words in total  suffering  (Dukkha in Buddhist Pali) by lack and want of human sentiments. Jarmusch is the Buddhist of Hollywood.

Bill Murray perfectly plays the role of the old millionaire, living in his dark mansion. The women that he meet to find his son are all meant to show a portrait of America. First we get to meet Laura and her daughter Lolita (whom tries to get him in bed with her from the first scene and in one scene walks around completely nude talking on her cellphone). The second woman that he meets, Dora, is supposed to be the upper class wife whom lives in an "" antiseptic McMansion"" and the food they eat is a riot. it is rice, some fish and some carrots and they are all made in an ""artsy"" yet ""clean"" way. The other two women also show a portrait of the American, Carmen (the quirky pet comunicator) and Penny (the redneck woman). The movie does not miss anything like small details such as the expensive dog treats at Carmens place, the ""beaded"" cell phone of Lolita (Yes, she plays the same role as in Nabakov, and I started chuckling to myself when she mentioned her named), the piles of rusted cars in Pennys frontyard and many other details that desribe America in a nutshell.

2445226,4,B000BX8R10,"In the Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche is focused on the idea of intoxication, of being intoxicated, filled up, and engulfed in a passion. Nietzsche contrasts the the Dionysian impulse and the Apollonian. The Apollonian is the visual arts, and gives an appearance of form and stability. The Dionysian is intoxication, and its representation in the arts is music. Like music, the Dionysian is constantly moving through time, whereas the Apollonian, like sculpture and painting, is stationary, forever present in one form. These two impulses represent, for Nietzsche, the ""origin and essence of Greek tragedy.""

For Nietzsche, tragic plays were the high point for Greek culture. The Dionysian spirit embodied them, since it is out of music that tragedy emerged. Tragedy was great because it moved beyond a moral and ethical interpretation of the events described in the play. The world of tragedy presupposes that there is no objective order. It is not evil or wrongdoing that causes suffering. It is just part of the chaos of existence. Meaninglessness is inherent to existence. In tragedy, the Greeks showed how one could confront this, by recognizing the Apollonian images of reality, and surviving the meaninglessness through a Dionysian ""intoxication"" of life.

The golden age of tragic plays would end with the birth of Euripidean drama, where the Dionysian impulse is disavowed, and the hero has a connection to virtue, knowledge, and morality. In Broken Flowers, the recent film starring Bill Murray, Murray's character, Don Johnston, must decide whether to continue and bask in perpetual intoxication, or attempt to get a clear, `sober', look at his world.

Don Johnston is a self made rich man, preferring to remain in the comfort of his living room. He seems to be unfazed even as his latest girlfriend decides to leave him and move out. Don, whose fortune has come through his knowledge of computers, leaves his house-a house without a computer-to help his neighbor, Winston, fix his computer. Don decides to read an anonymous letter he has received. It is shockingly revealed that he has fathered a son 20 years ago, and that this 19 year old boy is out searching for his father. Since no name is written in the letter, Don enlists the help of go-getter friend Winston, an Ethiopian immigrant holding down three jobs to support a wife and five kids, to help him figure out which of the five women he was dating around that time could possibly be the mother of his son.

Winston researches and plans the trip, and Don sets out on an adventure to reconnect with his old flames and come to grips with his past. Connected often with tragedy is irony, such as the confusion by those he meets over his name, mistaking Don for Miami Vice actor Don Johnson, who in real life is not half the celebrity of Bill Murray, or girlfriend number one's daughter Lolita, often naked and always suggestive around Don, to the chagrin of mother Laura, herself not afraid to jump into bed with Don after a 20 year break.

The visits to each successive old flame get worse, leaving us, and Don, to wonder whether his effort to move from the Dionysian to the Apollonian is worthwhile. Should Don have stayed in his home, with the blinds down, the lights off, in his comfort, if not happiness, zone? Does Don receive the answers he is looking for, and in turn, the peace of mind that has not come with what the film suggests are his numerous sexual conquests as he lived a life of Dionysian intoxication?

Spoiler Alert! I think the greatness of this film is that it gives us the struggle between the Dionysian and Apollonian impulses, without showing its hand and revealing where it stands. The movie concludes with the young man that Don believes may be his son leaving him, and Don is as confused as when he first opened the anonymous letter. We are left wondering whether, as Nietzsche claims, tragedies are the highest apex of the beautiful, offering us a respite from meaninglessness, with Don's despair resulting from his attempt to leave the Dionysian for the Apollonian, or if, as Socrates suggests, the beautiful is something that can be comprehended and seen as true, with Don's despair the result of not finding an answer that he knows is out there.",1129680000,3,4243,4.84551724137931
2445227,3,B000BX8R10,"Oh boy. Enough with the artifice of minimalism. Murray's latest bare-bones entry seems like a quick slide down to being a one-trick pan-faced pony. Lost in Translation was slick and novel for its time, even had some genuine cross-cultural humor thrown in. The Life Aquatic was quirky in bits if too sporadic for a general audience. But Broken Flowers' strained effort at being a soulful existentialist pondering just got my dander up.

The theme, I admit, is intriguing. Don (Murray) is a middle aged man leading a pitifully listless life. One day he gets an anonymous pink letter saying he had fathered a kid twenty years ago. Egged on by his faux-detective Ethiopian friend, he sets off to interrogate all his ex girlfriends. The vivid assortment of these women -- Sharon Stone as an isolationist closet organizer, Jessica Lange as a flaky animal communicator, Tilda Swinton as a redneck biker woman, and Frances Conroy as a button-down prefab real estate agent -- gives the film its only promise of flavor in contrast to Don's banal existence. I recall a couple of moments that I found amusing enough to blurt out laughing.

But in a stylish statement of keep-the-audience-guessing, everything goes unexplained, unexplored. Why does Don not own a computer despite having made his fortune in the computer business? Why had none of his relationships worked out?

The pace, slower than a barrel of tree slugs, seems moody at first. I began by enjoying the great economy with which Murray plays his part; we can almost see through his transparent countenance to figure what he is thinking. But it quickly gets tiresome. He spends endless minutes driving at what seems like 5 mph, or gawking at roadside walls, or sitting in awkward sullenness across the table from his counterparts. There is even a gratuitous faux-Lolita nudity moment thrown in, which, like much else, amounts to very little.

At the end of it all we are probably expected to tie all those loose strands into a conception that should make it all amusing and oh-so-thoughtful. ""Live in the present"" is the bankrupt philosophy that we are left to mull over, which seems rather apt, because beyond that disappointed moment in the theatre when the credits suddenly started rolling, this is an utterly forgettable, insipid exercise in Murrayism, built on the assumption that some newfangled Ethiopian jazz (which sounds like a Gotan Project recording on an African safari) will make up for the spice that the storytellers clearly forgot to bring to the table.

A largely boring film with a cavalcade of big name stars that should appeal to pedantic critics, or people looking for a good background for a comfortable afternoon nap.

2445228,5,B000BX8R10,"Broken Flowers is, in many ways, not a typical film for Jim Jarmusch. But then again, what is? After twenty five years of work, Jarmusch is still one of the most original and creative directors in the US. Broken Flowers is not, by any means, his best; it is his most sensitive and most mature, though. Many have blamed Jarmusch of going mainstream on this film. That's partly true - in the sense that it conforms to film-genre norms more than any of his previous films. By that I mean: Dead Man (1995) was a western that was an antithesis to every other western in the world. Ghost Dog (1998) was a gangster film and a samurai film, and at the same time it was absolutely neither. Broken Flowers doesn't actively challenge Hollywood; instead, it's a study in character and in human life. As such, it's the most personal, most beautiful film that Jim had pulled yet, and it manages to do what films like Sideways have tried to do in recent years but just didn't get right.

More than it is a triumph for Jarmusch, Broken Flowers is a triumph for Bill Murray, who plays Don Johnston, an aging Don Juan who receives a letter regarding a long lost son, and sets out to find which of his old flames the mother is. Like most of Jarmusch's films, the premise is simple, and the film is slow and minimalist, but the combined strengths of Jarmusch's direction and script and of Murray's performance make it a powerful experienced. Murray, who had spent much of his youth as a successful mainstream comedic actor, had in the last few years, with a chain of critically acclaimed films that included Rushmore, Lost In Translation and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, based himself as one of the most talented and intelligent actors at the fringes of Hollywood. His poker-face, which shows none and yet reveals all, comes to wonderful use in the role of Don, which in a way is further development of the character he created in Sofia Coppola's beautiful Lost In Translation, and it may just be the most brilliant performance of his career - yet.

The rest of the small cast is absolutely flawless; like in most of Jarmusch's films, in Broken Flowers Don is the only true major character, but he's better defined by the fascinating personalities surrounding him. Four stellar actresses - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under's Ruth Fisher), Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton, play the women in Don's life, each one shedding her own unique light on him; Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat, Angels in America), one of the most humble and underrated actors in Hollywood today, is fantastic as Don's neighbor Winston; Julie Delpy (Killing Zoe), Alexis Dziena, Christopher McDonald, Pell James and Mark Webber (Hollywood Ending) are all worthy of praise as well.

You can say that Jarmusch has gone 'middle of the road', but the fact is that all his marks are here, color and all; and none of it is fake, he's still one of the most sincere and most original creators in America. His unique approach to cinematography, to pacing, to editing and to music (Ethiopian fusion artist Mulatu Astatke does for Broken Flowers what John Lurie did for Down By Law, Neil Young for Dead Man, and RZA for Ghost Dog, and Jarmusch's fusion of music into the film is as seamless as it always is) are fresher and more creative than anything seen in any mainstream film and Broken Flowers is probably the most beautiful film we'll see this year.",1128124800,,3406,4.673333333333333
2445229,4,B000BX8R10,"Don Johnston is what one would call a ladies' man, though as seen in the movie, he really doesn't understand women or himself.  When he receives an anonymous letter telling him of a son he sired 19 years ago, his dominant inclination is to ignore it and simply go on with life - which for him involves long periods of time on his sofa, watching T.V. or listening to music without really seeming to hear it.

On the other hand, his next-door neighbor Winston, an effusive family man, is excited by this mysterious letter and outlines a trip for Don that would involve Don visiting four ex-lovers who, given the time frame, are potential mothers of the young man (the fifth woman who fits the time frame is dead, and one startlingly painful scene is Don's visit to her graveside).  Don allows Winston to twist his arm into investigating the letter, and a long road trip ensues, in which he pays a visit to each woman.

They're all so very different, these women.  Laura (Sharon Stone), is a widow with a sexually precocious daughter (who is aptly named, as you will see).  Dora (Frances Conroy) is in real estate, lives with a patronizing husband, and is a pale shadow of what she was in youth.  Carmen (Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator, getting into the heads of troubled pets, yet isn't the trippy, mellowed sort of woman that you might expect.  And then there's Penny (Tilda Swinton), who lives in a backwoods house with junk in the yard and a couple of scruffy, overprotective men.

The meetings with these women are each distinct and leave sharp impressions.  As Don goes from woman to woman, bearing flowers, he senses what impact, if any, he left on their lives.  And in seeing the ways they've changed and what has become of them, he has cause to reflect on his own life.  What he learns is not so easy to say; Don deepens, the change subtle and difficult to articulate.

Bill Murray has a great ability to inhabit the character of Johnston, who is dry, ironic, quiet and emotionally disconnected; many other actors would have rendered the character dull to watch, particularly in those moments of the movie where Johnston does nothing but sit and stare, seemingly devoid of energy and will.  In contrast, Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is a man with simple joys, great enthusiasm, and deep love for family and life; he is a character that can't help bringing a smile to your face and is the perfect foil for Don.  And each woman Don meets - you can't help but wonder what Don felt for each one, how he regards them now, what brought them together and what drove them apart.  Throughout the movie there are recurrent themes - the color pink, for example, and the image of flowers - and the wonderful soundtrack underscores the movie's moods.  For example, there is the sensual music of a CD that Winston makes for Don's road trip, and there's a heartbreaking excerpt from a requiem that Don listens to in the dead, dark quiet of his living room.",1126742400,3,2953,4.594285714285714
2445230,5,B000BX8R10,"Thank god!  After one of the worst summers for movies in years, we needed a thoughtful, subtle, quietly intelligent film to balance out the horrors of the previous months.  I have long been an admirer of Jim Jarmusch, having seen STRANGER THAN PARADISE the first weekend it was shown in Chicago and all of his subsequent films.  This is, in my opinion, one of his very finest films.  It is also another surprisingly fine performance by Bill Murray, who in his mid-fifties has put together a string of unexpectedly excellent performances.  For those who still think of his more from his over-the-top, gonzo roles of the early eighties, these roles could almost stand as the the complete antithesis of what he used to do.  Indeed, it would be hard to find many performers who could contrast the goofiness of Murray's role in CADDYSHACK with this role in BROKEN FLOWERS.  If in the former he crazily managed to generate all kinds of rage at gophers, here he manages to suppress any kind of rage at all.  In fact, Murray's Don Johnston in this film is like someone from whom all hints of human emotion have been sucked clean.

Structurally, this movie reminded me somewhat of Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, in which an older man (in the Bergman a quite old man) takes a trip during which he is forced to confront the life he has been denied by the life choices he has (or has not) made.  After Johnston's girlfriend (played by Julie Delphy) leaves him, he receives a pink-enveloped note in the mail in which someone anonymously informs him that twenty years earlier when they had an affair, she has become pregnant and had a child of whom he was unaware, a child who was now a 19-year-old boy who could possibly be coming in search of him.  Prodded by his next door neighbor Winston (marvelously played by Jeffrey Wright), Johnston compiles a list of potential mothers of a child from that time, and goes off in search of clues as to who the authoress of the note might be.

Johnston's journey involves visiting five former girlfriends, four living and one deceased.  One is the widow (played nicely by Sharon Stone) of a NASCAR driver who is also the mother of an absurdly sensual teenaged girl improbably named Lolita (who wears ear rings that mimic the famous sunglasses worn by Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA).  Another (played by SIX FEET UNDER's Frances Conroy) is a real estate agent married to a mildly irritating fellow agent.  A third ex (played by Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator, author of several quite odd books, and, it is hinted, a lesbian.  His most unpleasant encounter is with a former girlfriend who has become a backwoods societal drop out (played by the very nearly unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, who wears a long black wig to hide her red hair).  None of these apparently the mother of his possible son, though several are vague possibilities.

Though Murray starts off the film as someone incapable of human emotion, as if he just can't be bothered to care, by the end some subtle new emotions begin to assert themselves, such as regret, sadness, remorse.  None of the people he meets have spectacularly enviable lives, but one senses that Johnston has understood his own complete lack of a personal history, his lack of a network of significant human relations.  The film ends with his meeting a young man he mistakenly believes might be the son searching for him.  Though a profoundly cold person, we see by the end that he is someone who yearns for more, and is forced to confront the lack of anything at all significant.

This is truly one of the loveliest movies I have seen in quite a while, and it forms a nice trilogy with Murray's two previous significant roles in LOST IN TRANSLATION and THE LIFE AQUATIC.",1125964800,2,3747,4.697247706422019
2445231,4,B000BX8R10,"Jarmusch's movie is startling and bold, in a somnolent sort of way. Jarmusch is all about symbolism, and Murray is perfect for the role of Don Johnston, a wealthy bachelor who lives through life, seemingly emotionless.  His angst over losing girlfriend Julie Delpy at the film's beginning, is buried deeply, and shown only in the way he sleeps and wakes...a deadish man who makes a feeble attempt to talk Delpy into staying.  As she leaves, the mail she leaves contains a letter from an old lover who doesn't identify herself, other than to say that Johnston has a son who is 19 years old.

Enter Don's neighbor, Winston (the very capable Jeffrey Wright).  His life  is 180 degrees away from his friend Don's.  His house, bursting at the seams with his glowing wife and 5 children, is full of toys.  Despite the fact that he has three jobs, he is writing a mystery novel.  Don's mysterious letter (in a pink envelope) is a goldmine for Winston, and he determines that Don will pursue this mystery, and must provide a list of potential mothers - lovers from 20 years prior.

From the reluctantly prepared list Winston culls not only addresses, he mapquests the instructions to reach each house and books Don's flights and rental cars.  Don is reluctant, but can't afford to turn down this slice of life that Winston offers.  He embarks on the journey.

The movie breaks down a little for me here...the repetitive shots of Don flying in and out of airports get on one's nerves, particularly since Don never seems to go anywhere different.  The five women are all located off the beaten path from each airport, and Jarmusch is careful not to identify the cities with landmarks.  In truth, the scenery is so similar for each location (kind of an upstate NY-Jersey-PA small town trip) that you wonder if Jarmusch is making a statement about the fact that all of Don's loves have chosen similar scenery, or if perhaps the film just didn't have enough funding to make the womens' locations more diverse.  A nagging point for me.

 There's a running small gag about Don's rental cars and hotels...although he can afford much better, Winston has economized with different color Ford Taurus' and chain motels located off busy highways.  The audience picks up on Don's silent notation of Winston's predicted clues; a woman who likes pink, signs of a young man in the house (in this case, the existence of a basketball hoop in each location).

Following Winston's plan, Johnston drops in on the four women from his past (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton). In these scenarios, Jarmusch focuses on the color pink...they color of the flowers Johnston invariably brings to each of the women, following Winston's orders, and the increasing focus on the color he encounters from each visit.  Each woman is more and more intense, and each vignette turns up the volume on the symbolism of the color.  Johnston is greeted unfailingly with surprise, as though each of the women knew that, by his choice, he would never see them again (out of sight and out of mind; younger women are available!).

These vignettes with the women shed some light on Johnston, but Jarmusch, I was led to believe, shot them with the focus on the women themselves, and not Johnston's reaction to them.

As Laura, Sharon Stone is lush and cheap- her daughter Lolita shows sexual significance and eroticism that the viewer believes she copies from her mother.  Young Lolita shocks even the jaded Johnston.  With only a daughter, clearly Laura did not send the letter. Laura's wantonness and availability lead Johnston to spend the night; a decision he clearly regrets in the morning.  Stone is as ""dead on"" in her portrayal as an actress can be.

Frances Conroy, as Dora,  shows rapid aging and deterioration found in women married to a control freak who successfully subjugates them without abuse or violence.  Ron (Christopher McDonald, who has appeared in countless roles on TV), the monstrous husband, has her in a cookie cutter house and sneers at the picture of the young Dora in hippie garb and flowers, that she keeps to remind her of who she once was.  It is unclear if Dora has a child...she responds that she has no children with Ron.  Johnston is understandably uncomfortable in this house where violence simmers behind the carefully groomed shrubs and carefully groomed owners.  He leaves after being forced to stay for dinner.  Jarmusch again uses quiet symbolism in the food Johnston is served...it clearly reflects the life that Dora now leads.

Jessica Lange has always been a powerful actress, and hers is a rich role.  An attorney when he knew her, Lange's Carmen is now in the field of veterinary medicine - but she doesn't treat the animals, she talks to them, and analyzes them emotionally.  Unlike the former two women, the sense is that Johnston was deeply involved with Carmen, and that the regrets that they are no longer together are his, not hers.  Carmen is an overachiever; she's bitter; she's removed herself from any emotion and she doesn't want to explain herself to Don.  A malevolent force in Carmen's life is Chloe Sevigny, who plays her office assistant, and the guardian of Carmen's forbidding castle.

Swinton's cameo is almost gone before the cameras catch it, but in her desolate backwoods world, pink is startling and pouring out of nooks and crannies in the house and landscape.  She's drawn by the site of Don immediately to anger and violence.  The viewer is surprised, given her surroundings and her actions, when Don says...""you left me, Penny"".  Johnston is subjected to an attack by her friends, and finds himself broken and sad, finally expressing emotion, visiting the graveside of Michelle, the last of the women he identified for Winston.  It's possible that the son in question may have come from the liaison with either Penny or Michelle.

There are a couple of dream sequences strewn in Don's journey, startling in that the viewer really doesn't understand what they mean or why they are filmed.  As the journey proceeds, Don becomes more and more aware of young men in their late teens - the final sequences, which are frustrating for some(in that they provide no answer to the mystery), deal with his encounters with them, and his summary for Winston.

Murray plays his detached, nuanced character from ""Lost in Translation"", with perhaps a less effective script.  Supporting performances are crystal clear and the players are visibly more engaged than is Murray's.  Winston is a delight, and each one of the actresses must have yearned for the richness of the character they finally get to play on the screen in middle-aged cameos.  Symbolism, as noted before, abounds.  Sometimes it gives the viewer food for thought, and sometimes it just gets in the way.

At the end of the film (which has a subtle and fitting score), I was absorbed, involved, and vaguely unsure of why.  I was also curious about why Murray's character gets so deeply involved in the quest for the young man; obviously, Jarmusch is conveying self-discovery, but there is no joy at all in the process, at least none on view for this filmgoer.

Jarmusch has created a successful film for small theater venues, and art houses, that is being picked up around the country as a feature film, given the success of ""Lost in Translation"".  That's dangerous, because many will attend looking for Murray's comedy and grow angry at the ""waste of film"" and lack of action in what is really a superb small film.  Thus, look for a lot of 1 and 2 star reviews for the movie, but if you are a serious follower of films that make you think, see ""Broken Flowers"".

4 stars.",1125705600,177,7668,4.815889992360581
2445232,5,B000BX8R10,"I have seen Jim Jarmusch's earlier work (Stranger than Paradise) as well as his later work (Ghost Dog) and so I had an idea about what he'd do with this film, but the cast also got me excited once I heard about them.  One thing that's most striking about the film is the use of silence to convey things.  Jarmusch uses it in part to signal the awkwardness of everyday conversation and experience as well as for the purpose of outlining what his character is like.  He has no problem having minutes of silence where the only realization is that the main character is bored, lives a boring life,  and has no desire to really do anything remotely interesting.  These things add up to an experience that most filmgoers are not going to appreciate, or like.  Most people are trained to believe that everything that makes it into the film must be interesting, when in actuality the rule is that everything that makes it into the film must be in the film.  That last sentence is not meant to suggest that the film doesn't have interesting moments, because it does it's just that the film doesn't feel it's necessary to interesting from beginning to end. The run through of the story is that Don Johnston is a wealthy man who's trade was computers and now he doesn't even have computer at home.  His girlfriend leaves him and notes that he just recieved a letter that is probably from another one of his girlfriends. He reads it and is nonplussed. It is an anonymous letter stating that he has a son and the son has come looking for him, he reads this to a friend who interested in writing mystery novels so the friend looks into solving the myster for him by setting up detailed plans for Don to seek and find out who the mother is.  He goes to all of the women he was with at the time, that he remembers and follows a simple plan (he brings pink flowers, since the envelope and paper it was written on were in pink and it was typed on a typewriter, so he asks about them when he goes).  Each woman presents an entirely different obstacle for Don to overcome.  With the first woman it's her daughter, with the second it's her husband, with the third it's her receptionist, with the fourth it's her boyfriend (?) and his friend and the fifth girl is dead.  Some of these encounters are funny, some are violent, and some are uncomfortable.  Mainly I find it interesting how Jarmusch decided to make a movie about a character who doesn't want a movie made about him, wouldn't care if there was, and has not interest in seeing it even if he lived next to the theatre. Making the main character a reluctant and offbeat character enhances this story in a way that obviously won't appeal to many people, but it appealed to me. Also, the acting in some of the scenes was simply excellent. For instance, the scene in which he goes to see his former lover who has become a real estate broker and he ends up eating dinner with them. In this scene Christopher McDonald is simply great. Although the film has a relaxed attitude about the mystery that spurs the action forward, it still has some interesting features of the most interesting mysteries.  It has plotlines and clues that may or may not lead to anything.  I'm not giving anything away by saying that this film leaves some of the mystery wide open while dispelling some of it. What's also funny about this mystery are the dreams he has where he's internally processing different things he notices during his journeys.  You wonder if they will actuall lead to anything and that is something I will leave to those who to see the movie to find out.  As for Murray, I like this part of his career just as much as when he was younger.  He may be funny, but now he's working on being more than that and in this film some of his decisions are divisive, but I'm glad that he's making them because they make his characters more individual and you can't just say that they're the ""The stock Bill Murray character."" I wouldn't have given the film a prize persay, but enjoy it nonetheless.",1125360000,,4018,4.450953678474114
2445233,4,B000BX8R10,"If you thought Bill Murrary was underplaying in Focus Features' ""Lost in Translation,"" he makes that role look like Tom Cruise on Oprah compared to what he puts on the screen here in ""Broken Flowers.""  Murray is completely believable as the undiagnosed yet obviously depressed, stuck and emotionally devoid Don Johnston.  A little pink envelope from a (ex-?)lover and wanna-be detective neighbor Winston (the great Jeffrey Wright) slowly but surely shakes Don from his moorings.

I'll admit, like others, to feeling perplexed and unsatisfied by the ending.  However, I'll also own up to the fact that I completely missed a key clue in the movie, which - after realizing it later and piecing things together - I feel took me to a higher level of appreciation of Jim Jarmusch's direction.  Well played, Mr. Jarmusch.

That's not to say ""Broken Flowers"" is on par with ""Lost in Translation.""  That was Murray's role of a lifetime - no question he deserved an Academy Award for that.  Let's hope for a make-up call here.

And, what the world needs now is more Julie Delpy.  Her luminous presence at the beginning of ""Broken Flowers"" has me once again scratching my head trying to figure out why every director in Hollywood isn't beating down her door.  This smart, attractive actress should be on everyone's A-list.  Anyone who disagrees needs to watch her Nina Simone impression at the end of ""Before Sunset.""  She's so pitch-perfect and fetching, you'll be slack-jawed.",1125273600,,1467,4.963114754098361
2445234,5,B000BX8R10,"Near the end of this film, a young man who might be Don Johnston's (Bill Murray's) son asks for a bit of philosophical wisdom from a fellow traveler.  What he gets (see the title for this review) is not original but probably appropriate for one who gets described by almost everyone else as a ""Don Juan.""  That is, of course, the idea behind the famous romancer: that romantic love and sex are all about the here and now (that is why romantic love and marriage are such uneasy ""bed partners"": the best that romantic love can offer is an unimaginable ""happily ever after"" because the real future is not so romantic).

The response, ""what are you, a Buddhist?"" is a deliberate jab on the part of Jarmusch at this philosophical approach that says everything and nothing.  The irony is that this film will likely be appreciated for its moments more than for what I take to be its underlying critique of the ""philosophy of the moment"" (a version of an existentialist philosophy).

Because Don lives in the moment, he cannot really act -- he has no character.  What he does is merely a reaction to those he is  with -- he is for others just what they expect to see in him.  He lets his actions be dictated to him by his neighbor.  He never describes himself in this film but is described by others: as a Don Juan, as Don Johnson, as a rich man, as a computer guy.  It's significant for this question of labels that Don made his money in computers but refuses to have one in his house.  That would define him.  He doesn't like any labels to stick: even when he thinks he's found his son he tells him not that he is his father but merely admits that he might seem like that to the boy.  (This issue of labelling is fairly complex in the film: most everyone in the film can be labeled and even accepts a label - Lolita, the real estate agent, the pet communicator; note though that Don's neighbor isn't easily labeled -- he's a Jamaican family man with three jobs who fancies himself a detective but whose daughter insists he can't be identified with any of the ""famous detective"" labels that Don tries to pin on him.)

The idea of having a son is precisely what he has to reject if he is going to hold on to his philosophy: because to be a father is to have an inescapable past, a moment that defines you essentially in relation to another person, and to have a future that is bound up with the vicissitudes of that other person's life.  At the end of the film, though, in the first real show of feeling and passion Don begins to want such a connection -- as if in despair over his own lack of identity.  The ambiguity of the ending captures this despair in a simple and powerful way.  A very fine film, well worth the ride -- with an incredibly cool Jamaican jazzy soundtrack.",1125273600,,2770,4.357976653696498
2445235,2,B000BX8R10,"Jim Jarmusch's latest self-consciously independent effort won the Special Jury Prize at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. All I can really say in response to that is...why? Of the '05 films I haven't liked I'm perhaps most frustrated with ""Broken Flowers."" I don't see the innovation, the skill behind it: I really don't see anything (besides a relatively strong cast).

""Broken Flowers"" tells the story of Don Johnston (Bill Murray), an ""over-the-hill Don Juan"" (which wins the award for the most obvious pun of the year) whose latest fling breaks up with him and storms out in a fit of rage. The next day, Don wakes to see a pile of letters including a pink envelope, which he ignores till he arrives at his friend Winston's (Jeffrey Wright) house. Eventually, they read the anonymous letter which informs Don of a son who may or may not be looking for him. Don's friend is intrigued and organizes an entire trip through memory lane so Don can revisit four women from twenty years ago, one of whom may be the mother of the alleged child.

Throughout the film, Jarmusch keeps his distance from the audience with intentional awkwardness. Often times Bill Murray is seen sitting in a room, staring at random objects that could mean something, but after staring for five minutes you realize they are simply objects. There came a point in the film where this ""silence is golden"" technique became hard to take. What's understandable is Jarumsch's desire to have the film's distance represent Don's emotional detachment from the world that surrounds him, but even the characteristic itself makes it hard to believe his most recent love interest would have ever taken an interest in him in the first place. There is a problem when the film's protagonist isn't convincing in the context of the plot; no, the entire basis of the film.

For ""Broken Flowers"" to work we are to believe that at some point in time, Don Johnston was a compelling, interesting, and alive human being. Unfortunately, though a case can be made that the four relationships Don explores were old sparks from long ago, it's a bit difficult to see this empty man loving anyone, enticing anyone. And why, exactly, is this man empty? Is it because his frequent relationships, he now realizes, have no meaning? Or is it because Bill Murray is in the central role and that's what he does nowadays, that nothingness he wears on his face as if it were interesting? I still believe Murray's Bob in Lost in Translation is the only three-dimensional version of Deadpan Bill. At least in ""Translation"" he was funny, and often adorable around Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), his ""accomplace;"" he was charming in a subtle, understandable sense. I could see a girl like Charlotte falling for him; he was plausible, and the overall work is probably Murray's best. Since then, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" and now ""Broken Flowers"" seem like no more than a couple of directors looking for a chance to take advantage of Murray's critical success and, as a result, a credibility boost.

Coming into only my second Jarmusch film after the intensely boring ""Coffee and Cigarettes,"" I was expecting to see something subtle, calculated, inventive, yet slowly paced so that one can process the emotions that had been laid out on the screen in previous sequences. I guess I misheard much of Jarmusch's praise, because instead of subtle I saw over-obviousness (ie the Lolita jokes, the personality quirks/vocations of the four women that were as rediculous as they were meaningless, the underscoring that screams ""look at how outside of the mainstream I am!"", the color pink as a motif which amounts to absolutely nothing), useless calculation (in scenes that needed to be observed, such as the moment which may have been Johnston's emotional turning point, the editing was swift to revert to sequences of an eery quiet where nothing is said or seen or felt), nothing new (if anything is said in ""Broken Flowers"" it's been said before, and better), and the slow pacing was painstakingly lethargic.

Though ""Broken Flowers"" may not be the worst release of 2005 I will end up remembering it as a most gargantuan disappoinment. Its cast was promising (Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright, Julie Delpy, Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Chloe Sevigny, and Tilda Swinton) and its director famed, but even the conclusion (my last hope) which declared ""I have meaning despite saying nothing"" felt forced, and thus I walked away with nothing, absolutely nothing. I've looked hard, I've thought extensively, yet..nothing. I may never be capable of understanding the encomium over ""Broken Flowers."" This movie literally is Don Johnston: unalluring, overdone, and striving for something which simply does not exist and may not even be present; and in it there is little emotion, and when feeling arrives, it is distant, fleeting.",1125187200,13,4864,4.9705159705159705
2445236,4,B000BX8R10,"Like his role models Yasujiro Ozu and Robert Bresson, accomplished indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch provides his typically slow-moving, elliptical ride of a movie by placing Bill Murray squarely in the driver's seat of this sometimes hilarious, more often bittersweet road film. The episodic structure and constant sense of dislocation draw the viewer into an idiosyncratic world filled with knowing glances and almost subliminal comments. Your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much things need to be spelled out for you, as Jarmusch the screenwriter prefers to drive a story by insinuation.

The plot, such as it is, revolves around lifelong bachelor Don Johnston, the subject of too many ""Miami Vice"" jokes, who opens a letter, typewritten on pink stationery, informing him that he has a 19-year-old son who may soon show up on his doorstep. The letter is unsigned, which tweaks the interest of Don's best friend and next-door neighbor Winston, an enthusiastic and persistent amateur sleuth. It is Winston who tracks down Don's ex-girlfriends across the country and organizes a trip for Don to meet and subtly ask each one a series of questions that may lead him to conclude who is the mother who penned the letter.

The subsequent film really provides mini-showcases for four fine veteran actresses (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton), who pierce through the hearts of their characters with minimum fuss. Don pretty much remains a cipher throughout these encounters, as he gleans just enough information to tell him what he needs to know. He first meets up with Laura, a recent widow with an exhibitionist adolescent daughter named appropriately Lolita. Looking as beautiful as ever, Stone underplays her white trash role with surprising subtlety, even as she vividly describes her race car husband's fiery death and chats about her calling as a closet organizer.

Next on Don's list is Dora, an uptight real estate agent married to a fellow glad-hand agent, who seems to be bubbling just below the surface about Don's sudden appearance. Conroy, ideally cast in a controlling variation of her Ruth Fisher character on ""Six Feet Under"", gives a nuanced performance of a woman cracking slowly within the walls of a perfect, pre-fab home. The next stop is at the office of renowned ""animal communicator"" Carmen, an edgy professional who has apparently abandoned men for animals and a misogynistic receptionist (played with an ideal sense of passive malice by Chlo Sevigny). Lange plays Carmen in sharp, unapologetic detail, conveying the bitterness she holds toward the type of man Don represents to her.

The last encounter is with an even more embittered biker chick named Penny, played with seething force by an almost completely unrecognizable Swinton, who is in turn, defended by a couple of hyper-sensitive, mullet-head bikers. What happens from all these episodes toward its intriguing conclusion will not satisfy those looking for closure, but Jarmusch provides enough emotional baggage for Don to recognize what his journey means to him and to us.

Murray is his typical deadpan self here, but he still maintains that peculiar sense of goodwill he has without which the character would have been simply insufferable. With a Jamaican accent, Jeffrey Wright is wryly comical as Winston even as his curiosity gets the best of him. Also worth mentioning are Pell James' sweet turn as a sympathetic flower shop clerk and Mulatu Astatke's jazzy musical score. Well worth watching for those who like to come to their own interpretations when observing the lives presented by Jarmusch and their personal histories of which we can only speculate.",1124928000,,3675,5.18013468013468
2445237,4,B000BX8R10,"Bill Murray's character of Don Johnston bears a few similarities to the character that he played in Lost In Translation, which was also produced by Focus Features.  Both of them are rich men who have hit a wall in their lives, and are having trouble with the women in their lives.  I had heard many good things about this movie, and the fact that it was produced by the same people who did Lost in Translation, one of my favorite movies, made me even more excited.  The result, however, wasn't everything that I hoped that it'd be.

As I said, Johnston is having trouble with women, in the sense that he can't really hold on to one.  His neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright) often notes that Don is like Don Juan, and many people call attention to the fact that his name sounds like Don Johnson.  Don seems to go through girlfriends pretty quickly.  His latest woman, Sherry (Julie Delpy) has just left him, and he finds an annonymous letter from an old flame saying that he fathered a son about 19 years earlier.  At first, he has no interest in what may be a prank, but Winston, who sees himself as a detective-in-training, encourages him to pursue his mystery son, and soon, Don has compiled a list of 5 possible women who may have had his child.  After a few internet searches, Don is on his way.

On his journey, he reconnects with a few of his former girlfriends, each of whom are living very different lives in very different places.  The first woman, Laura (Sharon Stone), is a widow living with her young (and possibly nudist) daughter (Alexis Dziena).  Dora (Frances Conroy) is a subdued real estate agent living under the passive aggressive Ron (Christopher McDonald), while Carmen (Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator who may have a certain bond with her receptionist (Chlo Sevigny).  Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in the middle of nowhere in the deep south, while the fifth woman is confronted under different circumstances.

The events of the search are both humorous (though not laugh-out-loud funny) and sad.  Some of them show regret for leaving Don, while others wish that he'd never shown up in their lives.  Others have problems with their current men.  Unfortunately, most of the events prior to the journey and what happens afterward aren't as interesting.  I will say that at the very end, his talk with a young boy (Mark Webber) seemed to be leading up to a certain ending, only to have something else happen.  While I was definitely expecting a very non-Hollywood ending, what we got was, in my opinion, a little unsatisfying.  I didn't hate it, but there was something missing in my opinion.

I'm going to try not to give too much away, but I think that writer/director Jim Jarmusch wanted us to draw our own conclusions about certain things using the themes of the film, such as the color pink, daughters, and sons.  All in all, this film wasn't bad, it's just very different (not that different is a bad thing).",1124841600,,2950,4.665377176015474
2445238,4,B000BX8R10,"""Broken Flowers"" is the story of Don Johnston, a middle-aged bachelor who seems melancholy and without purpose in his life. This is in sharp contrast to his neighbor Winston, a happy man with a beautiful wife and 5 children. When Don receives an unsigned letter indicating he has a 19 year old son, Winston arranges for him to leave on a quest to find his unknown offspring by visiting several old girlfriends.

The strength of this movie is that it has a sort of wry and intelligent humor that kept me laughing loud and long. The encounters with the previous girlfriends range from sexy to boring, nutty to violent. But each episode is imaginative and funny in it's own way.

The movie is also philosophically probing, as Don looks to his past to provide additional meaning to his lacking present life. Ultimately, Don finds no concrete answers and is left in the same existential dilemma as when he began. I found this lack of resolution to be a bit disappointing. But certainly more honest than your typical Hollywood flick where everyone lives happily ever after.",1124668800,,1067,4.762162162162162
2445239,4,B000BX8R10,"I once toyed with the idea of writing a column about how we REALLY see movies--that is to say, how the average viewer (who may or may not have something of a critical sensibility) sees movies.  Even those of us who love film passionatesly, but who are not professional critics, experience film in quite a different way from those critics, no matter how ""of the people"" they strive to be in their writing.  Simply put, if you see maybe a couple of films a week, and maybe the majority of those months or years after their release, your experience of those films HAS to differ from those in the pro-crit establishment, who as a professional necessity, live and breathe the cinema.

I was thinking about this very fact when I caught Jim Jarmusch's most recent film BROKEN FLOWERS.  I haven't seen nearly as much of his work as I might have liked--not nearly as much as thought I would have by now.  You know how it is, you have a running list of films you intend to see, books you want to read, music you hope to get around to listening to.  Then one day you realize that, hey, there are only so many hours in a day.  And most of those are spoken for by everyday life concerns.  So maybe you better pick and choose your entertainments carefully.

It's not too late, of course, but I wish I had chosen to get better acquainted with Jim Jarmusch's work well before now.  The understated humor, thoughtful and episodic approach, and his brutally honest cinematography (which captures the American landscape as it really is) were all elements that I felt I instantly understood and related too.  It's presumptuous at best to say that an artist's sensibility matches your own.  But you can't help but get excited when you begin to feel that kind of spiritual kinship.  In cinema, it happens all too rarely these days.

This is what some might call a ""quiet film.""  Casting Bill Murray as a laconic, vaguely depressive aging Don Juan (punnily named Don Johnston--jokey on a couple of levels, both pretty good) may seem almost too easy.  The aging, alienated hipster is a role that Murray could pretty much phone in.  But no one does it better--and I for one, prefer his jaded performance here to that of say LOST IN TRANSLATION.  He just seems more, well, ""at home"" wandering the contemporary American landscape than he did in the confines of a Tokyo superhotel and studio.

The inconclusive plot will frustrate some, but as some have noted a more conventional ""Hollywood"" ending would have been less than honest.  The story of a man's initially half-hearted search for a son of whose existence he never knew (and is actually still not sure of) seems like a dismal and futile quest from the outset.  But we go along willingly, in part for the absurd comedy of it all.  In part, because we all have loose ends that were never quite tied up in any satisfactory way.  You can't go back again?  Well, you can try, but you're really going someplace else.

As BROKEN FLOWERS suggests, the Information Highway has made tracking down the people in your past much easier than at any time in history.

Actually reconnecting with those individuals is quite another matter.",1124582400,4,3152,4.624100719424461
2445240,4,B000BX8R10,"Don Johnston, the main character of ""Broken Flowers,"" is a guy who has apparently made a fortune in computers, yet doesn't actually have a PC in his home.

He's played by Bill Murray, and the movie opens at a point in his life when he is content to just sit in front of his large-screen TV or zone out to music all day while his large, pale house settles around him.

When his latest girlfriend leaves him, he simply shifts from a sitting to a reclining position on the couch.

But then he gets a mysterious letter from an anonymous ex; it informs him that he has a 19-year-old son who may be trying to find him.

His neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), eagerly sees this as a mystery to solve -- surely it shouldn't be too hard to track down the boy's mother -- so he puts together a dossier for Don's investigation (complete with rental car reservations, profiles of Don's four former lovers, Mapquest directions to their homes and a handy CD of Ethiopian jazz) and sends him on his way.

Most of the rest of the movie involves Don's very different reunions with a quartet of very different ex-girlfriends (played by Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton and Frances Conroy).

Going into ""Flowers,"" though, I wondered if Murray really should play yet another glib, vaguely-depressed-but-funny middle-aged guy not unlike his characters in ""Rushmore,"" ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""Lost in Translation."" I'm a fan of him and of those movies, but they tended to frustrate as many people as they delighted, and seeing Murray stare down another midlife crisis almost feels like watching Billy Bob Thornton play another surly drunk or Angelina Jolie play another femme fatale.

He gets away with it again, though, and ""Flowers"" is, again, one of those movies that will please some greatly and absolutely confound others.

That split is largely the result of writer-director Jim Jarmusch, who specializes in movies that would march to the beat of a different drummer if they actually chose to march at all. His films (""Stranger Than Paradise,"" ""Coffee and Cigarettes"") are comedies that tend to elicit lots of wry smiles instead of huge belly laughs. Low on plot, they move at their own steady pace.

""Flowers"" is no exception and it certainly takes its time; it's also a wise, funny and eventually very moving little film, with a script that carefully lets viewers answer some of the story's questions on their own. There's also a lot of fine acting, especially from Wright, who's extremely funny, and Lange, who's quite frightening; but this is mostly Murray's show and even if it feels a little like material he's covered before.",1124409600,2,2626,4.817777777777778
2445241,4,B000BX8R10,"Director Jim Jarmusch, best known to me for his work in making Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai, first worked together with Bill Murray in Coffee and Cigarettes before getting back together two years later to make Broken Flowers.

Broken Flowers features Bill Murray acting in a role similarly caught up in the mundane passing of time as was his character in Lost in Translation. Murray plays Don Johnston...with a T...a ""middle aged Don Juan"" with a whose past relationships with women are to be admired. As he says, he was just living his life when one day he receives a mysterious letter which had neither a return address nor a signed name. The letter read that it was from a woman from 20 years into Don's past and that shortly after they went their separate ways she gave birth to a son. Don's son.

Winston, Don's sleuth-obsessed neighbor gets involved to discover the origin of the letter. His blueprint involves Don creating a list of possible women from which he will plan an itinerary. The choice, then, is Don's; whether or not to set out on this wild goose chase to find a woman who may or may not have given birth to his child.

The movie was good. It was not great, it was not incredible, it was not wonderful. It was good. I think it COULD HAVE BEEN great, incredible and/or wonderful. Something was missing.

Winston was the loveable character. It was his role that should have been developed further. He and his family with their relationship to Don could have been used more. Maybe a few less cut scenes to watch a plane take off.

I understand that the idea was to let Don embark on an outwardly manifested journey into himself, but so many solo shots of Murray sitting quietly as he learned more about himself made the movie progress too slowly.

I know I broke the cardinal rule of movie watching and entered the theater last night with expectation(s) for this film. Granted I had not heard much of the movie itself, only that Murray was great. I will concede this point, but with exceptions. To an extent I will draw a parallel between Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Both men were great in their respective roles, the problem was that maybe the roles themselves needed work. The Terminal was a horrible film, so I will go no further in using the two movies in the same sentence. I said before, Broken Flowers is a good movie.

I laughed (maybe too) loudly at many points. That is part of what made the movie difficult for me as I would laugh so hard and then there would be such a long lull before the next laugh. This emphasized some parts of the movie as being slower than I believe they really were upon reflection; the contrast was too great.

There were two things that I definitely enjoyed about Jarmusch's direction. One, though it made me a bit nauseous, was his camera shot out Don's driver side window. The shot is right out the window, including the reflection in the side mirror. This shows Don on his journey through his past to maybe find a piece of his future. We watch the world pass by his window then vanish into the horizon. The second technique was the use of basketball hoops. Winston instructed Don to keep an eye out for clues that may indicate which of the women mothered a son. Each neighborhood he travels to shows a basketball hoop. The hoops are used as hope that maybe he is on the right path.

I was also fascinated by the newfound desire in a man who had never exhibited any signs of wanting a family of his own to find his son in the face of every 19 year old young man he passed on the street. ...So I guess that was three things I liked....

Either go in committed to ""the long haul"" or maybe get antsy in your uncomfortable theater seat, either way the movie is good. Maybe Jim Jarmusch will just let me see his next script ahead of time so we can work in a few more jokes to keep up the intensity. Until then, go see Broken Flowers. (Oh and I recommend Ghost Dog, too.)",1124409600,2,3960,4.397540983606557
2445242,3,B000BX8R10,"Bill Murray stars as Don Johnston, a man who is sleepwalking through his own life.  Sleep-sitting is probably a more accurate description as he seems reluctant to ever leave his couch.  As the film begins, Johnston's latest girlfriend (Julie Delpy) is in the process of moving out.  Johnston obviously doesn't want her to leave, but cannot seem to summon the energy or effort to talk her into staying.  After she leaves, he resumes his position on the sofa.

In a perverse version of ""tag, you're it (forever),"" Johnston receives an unsigned letter purporting to be from a former girlfriend, informing him that he has a grown son who may or may not be visiting him soon.  Upon showing the letter to his next door neighbor, Winston, he insists that Johnston investigate further by visiting the women in his past who fit the timeframe.  Jeffrey Wright turns in a pitch perfect performance as Winston, Johnston's only friend and connection with the outside world.  Winston is probably my favorite character in the film. The man is a human dynamo with an endless zest for life.  With five kids and three jobs, he still has time to organize a travel schedule for Johnston down to the smallest detail.

As Johnston drops in unannounced on the four women from his past (Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and Tilda Swinton), he is greeted with a varying mixture of surprise and suspicion.  Some former girlfriends are definitely happier to see him than others.  The only time Johnston indicates what might have been a deeper emotional attachment is when he visits the graveside of a fifth girlfriend.

As Johnston goes about his sad task, signs and symbols begin to appear everywhere, infecting both his dream and waking state.  Whether or not these are actual clues or simply random, recurring pedestrian objects that Don has chosen to fasten on is unclear.  I suppose Jarmusch wants the audience to make their own judgment call.

When Johnston finally does take some initiative, striking up a conversation with a young man whom he feels might be his son, he botches it miserably.  Don is completely out of practice with those social skills that would enable him to deal appropriately with people.

The pokey pace of the film can be a bit frustrating.  There are interminably long shots of scenery and painfully drawn out silences between the characters.  I know that Jarmusch's films are always about the journey and not the arrival, but these scenes really do seem to go on too long.

Murray delivers his usual subtly nuanced performance as the sad-sack lothario, Johnston.  All of the actresses are singular and memorable in their wildly diverse roles.  A slow but interesting journey for Johnston and the audience.",1124150400,2,2721,4.905908096280087
2445243,2,B000BX8R10,"Here is a rarity: a beautifully acted film with an engaging plot (as far as it goes) that frustrated me so much with its ending that I just had to give a 2 star rating. Perhaps it's really 2.5 stars, but that's as high as I can go.

The problem is that while the plot is engaging early on, it's a form of detective story, and the viewer is engaged by the desire to solve the mystery. There are lots of interesting characters and funny situations that arise during the episodic journey taken by Don Johnston (Bill Murray), not least the characters encountered in waiting rooms and on planes, and the dream sequences that Johnston experiences are obvious attempts to put together clues to solve the mystery that is the object of the journey. The fact that NOTHING is solved at the end strikes me as a proof that you were wrong to be so engaged in solving the mystery. It is a kind of horse laugh that seems meant to teach you that you shouldn't have expected a hollywood ending with all the knots neatly untied to reveal a solution.

My daughter loves Jarmusch, and defends the movie as being true-to-life. I don't think this is accurate, since the episodes that led up to the ending were dramatically (and humorously) engaging, clearly crafted to hold the viewer's interest. It is only the ending that is true-to-life, and we were given no warning of the ambiguity we would be left with. The movie reminded me of ""Blow-up"", the ambiguous 1966 film of Antonioni, that I also disliked.

Now if you're aware of how Jarmusch structures his films and are happy with an ending like this, I would raise the rating to 4.5. If you want your plot to lead somewhere 2 to 2.5 seems appropriate. My daughter said that it's like the difference between Mozart's Requiem (where you don't look for a plot, but the experience is beautiful) and the song ""Kilkelly"" which details a sequence of letters (based on real letters) from an Irish family to a man who's emigrated to America (the lyrics build to an intensely moving climax). I like both. But I still think that Broken Flowers misled me into thinking a puzzle would be solved at the end.",1123977600,3,2123,4.537859007832898

Broken Flowers is the latest film from director Jim Jarmusch.

Don (Bill Murray) is a seemingly retired person, who made a fortune in the computer business.  One day, he receives a letter with no return address or signature, claiming that he fathered a child with the writer and that the child, almost 19 years old, is now one his way to find his unknown father.  With the help of his would-be detective novelist neighbour (Jeffrey Wright, someone we should see more of in film), Don embarks on a trip to unexpectedly drop by a few former girlfriends, to try to figure out who sent the letter and who his child is.

There are too many quiet, contemplative moments that worked in Lost In Translation, that don't quite work here.  It's true that sometimes less is more, and that much can be communicated without relying on a lot of dialogue.  But after a while, the numerous quiet moments made the film seem tedious.  There are also parts that are meant to titillate, always involving females, but they don't really add to the story in any germaine way, with the exception of playing on men's interest in attractive women.  Was this some type of social commentary on the director's part?  Probably.

The real estate agent former flame (Frances Conroy)looked embarassed and the dinner scene was painful to watch.  However, it was also realistic.  We've all been in situations with that type of tension.  Jarmusch also tried to juxtapose the dry real estate agent and her bourgeois lifestyle with the hippie that she used to be when Don knew her.  The change is apparent without having it trupeted.  The animal communicator on one hand seemed loopy and self-imporatnt, but on the other hand, stand-offish. Real people are like that: more complex than mere stereotypes.  The redneck former girlfriend (Tilda Swinton)and her reasons for reacting to him upon his surprise visit, didn't develop any intrigue and didn't contribute to the story in a postive way.

Broken Flowers is not predictable, and that is one of its strong suits.  It's slow moving pace and ending may turn off mainstream audiences, however.  Those with different tastes may find this to be one of the best films of the year.  I can respect this film for trying to be different, but I don't think I would see it again or recommed it to everyone.

8093766,5,B000BX8R10,"There are two kinds of Bill Murray characters the actor plays in his films: One is the wise-cracking, smart-a**, authority bashing rebel who goes up against the system and gets the girl. This list of course includes Caddyshack, Stripes, Meatballs, Ghostbusters and the like. The other is the world-weary, resigned, much deeper and darkly deadpan Bill. This era kind of began with Groundhog Day and has run to include Rushmore, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom, St, Vincent and others. The subject of this review, Broken Flowers, is firmly in the world-weary camp. This would have to be one of Bill's best performances, and I think it's sad that it's not often recognized as such.
  Bill plays an aging ladies man who gets a mysterious letter in the mail from an old flame, saying that he has a son out there somewhere. With the help of his amateur detective neighbor (Jeffrey Wright) he goes off on a road trip to find the truth. The ex-girlfriends from the past do not, however, lead him anywhere to the truth. The film has a great twist at the end, which I of course won't give away. But pay attention to one of the credits at the end of the film, during the credit roll. That might contain the answer. Sometimes it does pay to watch the credits.
  Jim Jarmusch put this little beauty together, and it just drips with his deadpan cool and bone-dry wit. The whole sequence with Jessica Lange as a ""pet therapist"" is note for note perfect, down to Chloe Sevigny in her Go-Go-esque day-glo outfit. Sharon Stone and Tilda Swinton also deliver as two of the ex-girlfriends. I also liked the recurring joke of people noticing the similarity between Bill's character's name, Don Johnston, and a certain popular 80's TV actor of Miami Vice fame. And then there are moments which work only because Bill Murray pulls them off. The scene with Bill alone in his home, with a drink sitting in front of him and Marvin Gaye's ""I Want You"" playing on the stereo, is priceless. Any other actor doing this scene would be a waste of celluloid. But Bill gives it that deadpan, hillarious touch that only he can give it. Will he or won't he? Come on Bill, you know you want to. It's amazing to look back and notice in Bill Murray films how the little things he does, the small gestures, the tiny inflections, matter more than anything else. The man is a walking masterclass of acting.
  Now some astute film buffs may have noticed that this movie has a similarity to the greatest film ever made, Citizen Kane. It does. Bill is the reporter Thompson, the identity of his love child is Rosebud, and his ex-girlfriends are the various witnesses. And the mystery is all the more mysterious at the end, when we find out the secret in almost a throwaway moment. If you're gonna rip off somebody, rip off the best. No crime in that. The Kurasawa film Rashoman also bears a resemblance to Broken Flowers, right down to one of the ""witnesses"" already being dead. (Also referenced in Kane with the diary of the late Walter P. Thatcher.) This film even bears a closer resemblance to the Gary Oldman, Beethoven biopic Immortal Beloved. Anybody remember that one? But this is still it's own fine film, and Bill once again delivers in a roll that just deepens an already great career. If you haven't caught this one, then by all means do so.
