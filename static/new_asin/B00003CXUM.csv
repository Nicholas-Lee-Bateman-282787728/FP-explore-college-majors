It's sort of old technicolor. Maggie Cheung is gorgeous. The chemistry of the film invloves you so deeply, you don't notice the time spent watching it.

1328594,5,B00003CXUM,"As a huge, long-time fan of Wong Kar-Wai, I was very excited to hear about his latest effort, In the Mood for Love being released theatrically in the US. I had ordered the Chinese DVD in late 2000, and after viewing it was sure that once critics saw the film, the auteur would finally receive his comeuppance. Unfortunately, another ""Asian"" film (which was funded by US sources) came out in 2000 - a much bigger, more accesible film - that blew the competition away.
As they did with Lars Von Trier's The Idiots, USA Films has relegated In the Mood for Love away to the back shelves, preferring to spend more time on DVD special ediions of tripe like One Night at McCool's. If you were lucky, you lived in one of the few cities that In the Mood for Love played at in its theatrical run. If you are less lucky, your video store has rented to you a pan and scan VHS copy.
But gripes are no longer necessary as the wonderful Criterion has decided to release a spectacular 2-disc DVD set of ITMFL in late February. Supposedly a port of the Region 2 French Special Edition, the set includes hours of bonus material, including a half-hour of very interesting deleted scenes, complete with the director's commentary - a first.
I currently own three version of the film (Chinese VCD, Chinese DVD, and French Region 2 2-disc SE), and could not feel more obliged at the prospect of purchasing a (pricey) fourth. If you thought that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was what Asian film is all about, you are sorely mistaken. Pre-order Wong Kar-Wai's masterpiece In the Mood for Love to begin educating yourself on the beauty of cinema.",1008374400,5,1622,4.577319587628866

1328608,5,B00003CXUM,"Since many other posts discuss the story of In the Mood for Love, this review will be about the quality of the blu ray edition. It is wonderful to have my all time favorite movie on blu ray. The picture is very good for a movie that came out 15 years ago, definitely being an improvement over the DVD. Colors are vivid, images are sharper, and I even like the way the subtitles look better than the DVD. While the level of sharpness isn't what you will see on recent high definition films, this blu ray is the best version there will probably ever be of this film, and I must say I am very pleased with it. If you love this movie like I do and are considering making the jump to blu ray, I say go for it while this blu ray is available at this price. I missed out on acquiring the Criterion Collection blu ray of Chungking Express before it went out of print, so I am glad I did not make this mistake with In the Mood For Love.",1420243200,10,927,4.043478260869565

1328618,5,B00003CXUM,"In The Mood for Love is one of the great movies of the new millennium. The Criterion blu ray is excellent. The auteur Wong Kar Wai is incomparable in presenting textures in his movies: sounds, fabrics in clothing and decorations, mood, actors. Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Chung give extraordinary performances as the cuckolded spouses, who develop a friendship, and possible emotional relationship. The visuals and music are stunning. Maggie Chung's wardrobe is astonishing [for this viewer], a different dress for each hour of the day [at least so it seems]. Tony Leung was named 2001 Cannes Film Festival Best Actor for his portrayal--deservedly so.  In the Mood for Love, Chungking Express, Happy Together, and 2046 are the great Kar Wai's greatest achievments [so far]. Highly, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1395014400,7,804,5.232558139534884

A lot of extras on here as well that fans will appreciate. The story takes place in Hong Kong, 1962: Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen move in next door to each other and the film goes from there, examining ideas about love, alienation, sadness, etc. And with Wong Kar-wai you know the film is just absolutely gorgeous as it comes from a mature director at this point. His earlier films sometimes lacked grace, but this one has it in spades. The entire project presents a sumptuous and grand look that is hard to shake from your mind.

The woman's face remains out of focus. Despite the company of the woman, he is alone, isolated with his feelings.

Very much enjoying Criterion's handsome blu-ray release of Wong Kar Wai's masterpiece In The Mood For Love. The film is a 2 hour long masterclass in cinematography, set, costume and production design, the works. And the images are just so hauntingly pretty, utterly mesmerizing from start to end.

I'm also enjoying the supplementary materials, including a new interview with critic Tony Rayns. I was also suitably impressed by both Maggie Cheung & Tony Leung's impeccable command of English during the press conference at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2000.

1328635,5,B00003CXUM,"This movie is quite possibly one of the best movies ever created. It goes far beyond the cookie-cutter romance movies that one may find today in theaters. A love that, unknowingly, blossomed in the midst of the despair of two crumbling relationships. The music score sets the tone and the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again; re-discovering the meaning behind the subtle movements and revisiting the same emotions that you felt when you first watched it. It moves at a much slower pace and allows the viewer to relish each scene without seeming sluggish and repetitive. Definitely one of those movies you have to see at least once in your life.",1374796800,,731,4.7637795275590555

1328637,2,B00003CXUM,"I am becoming very cynical about screenwriters who insist on directing AND producing.  Unless you are a Fassbinder or a Bergman, you need help to visualize the emotions and thoughts from your pages.  Both couples look, move, and speak alike and little passion or desire shows under their very reserved mannerisms. The best complement I can give is that the peripheral characters are trimmed down.",1367452800,,396,5.076923076923077
1328638,5,B00003CXUM,"I was introduced to Wong Kar-wai through his earlier film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chungking-Express/dp/B004KVXC64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chungking Express</a>, an extraordinarily sweet, humor-filled exploration of romance in early-'90s Hong Kong. The energy of the filmic technique, the colors, the music, and the performances of that film left an indelible impression on me and I knew that I needed to seek out more of Wong's output. Via this Criterion release I have recently seen In the Mood for Love and, to my great delight, this latter film is just as wonderful as its predecessor while also being quite different.

In the Mood for Love is set in 1960s Hong Kong and is replete with the styles of the period. Like its predecessor, the colors in this film are quite vivid and the soundtrack, featuring an alluring waltz by Shigeru Umebayashi and Nat King Cole serenading in Spanish (!), is quite effective. Wong's mise-en-scene is impeccable. But unlike the infectious, popping energy of Chungking, Mood's tone is of repression -- the melancholy of unconsummated love. The deep reds and clouds of swirling cigarette smoke evoke a deeply erotic atmosphere, but like our two protagonists, Wong never allows the audience to succumb to our basic instincts, never resorts to cheap titillation. We watch these two people meet and fall in love with each other, grappling with the knowledge that they can never be together. There is no ""plot"" to speak of, only the fascinating relationship between these characters. The film is a slow burn, but never is it dull. Wong's film is a mature work that masterfully evokes a time and place, subtly exploring a love that can never be with great empathy and exquisite style.

Criterion's Blu-ray provides a first-rate presentation of the film. The video transfer is filmic and gorgeous with rich colors, and the soundtrack is no less lush. Extras include trailers, deleted scenes, several documentaries and interviews, a separate short film by Wong, isolated cues from the film's soundtrack, and a booklet featuring a critical essay as well as a short story that helped to inspire the film.

Overall, this is a robust package for this beautifully romantic film and comes very highly recommended.",1365984000,,2288,5.35
1328639,4,B00003CXUM,"This is a great movie and is presented in a superb edition with an exquisite quality of audio and video.

1328640,5,B00003CXUM,"There is a quote from this movie by Maggie Cheung ""You notice things if you pay attention"" and this is my final verdict about this movie. I think I have never seen such a stylish movie before. Really love the way they shot those scenes. I mean how come you can make a simple walk towards a noodle shop highly stylized and sensual and as entertaining as this? Its Wong Kar-wai's vision and directon which made the daily simple things and gestures this classy.

I really love both leading characters and specially Maggie Cheung for obvious reasons. There is no nudity or sex in this movie but yet I find this movie to be very sensual and erotic. I Love the overall subtle tone of the film. The ending is good. It ended as it should have, otherwise there will be no impact.

The background score is to die for. Glad to see that Criterion has included all the audio tracks in the extras section. There are plenty of extra material included by Criterion. The packing is great with a great looking booklet.

The Criterion BD looks and sounds great with so much extra content to enjoy. This is a must have Blu-Ray for any movie fan. Watch it if you want to see the beauty of foreign cinema.",1363651200,2,1183,4.392694063926941

In my opinion, the director Wong Kar-wai was so far ahead of their peers, the techniques, the music, the cast and the styles he used in this film was unbelievable successful.

In the Mood for Love has never looked better. The sound is also top notch with atmospheric effects spread out and the music coming across crisp and clear.

There are two new extras with this Blu-Ray edition but sadly the interactive essay by film scholar Gina Marchetti is gone, as is the photo gallery, key cast and crew biographies. In the liner notes, we no longer have the essays film critic Li Cheuk-to and the director's statement.

""@ In the Mood for Love"" is a 51-minute making of documentary that traces the film's origins to actual filming and how Wong made changes to the story as he went along. He says this film exists in the same world as his second film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Being-Wild/dp/B0002X7GWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Being Wild</a>, also set in the `60s. Tony Leung claims that early on the film was more erotic in nature but somewhere along the way changed to be more subtle.

There are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wong. He provides a bit of backstory to the footage and shares filming anecdotes. One scene revisits the characters 10 years later and we see how much they've changed in that time.

""Hua yang de nian hau"" is a montage of images from Chinese cinema set to Zhou Yuan's song of the same name. Wong uses archival footage to celebrate his country's rich cinematic history.

There is an interview with Wong Kar-Wai and he talks about the challenge of getting his film made during an economic crisis in Hong Kong. He speaks of his fondness for the time period depicted in the film. He also speaks eloquently about the characters and his approach to them while also briefly talking about how he directed Cheung and Leung's performances.

""Cinema Lessons"" features an interview with Wong at the Cannes Film Festival. He talks about his love of principal photography, which, for him, is like a vacation - hence his infamously long shoots.

Also included is the press conference at the Toronto International Film Festival with Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. They talk about working with Wong and how he never has a complete screenplay and likes to improvise while filming. They speak of the challenges they faced making it and how it made for a sometimes frustrating experience.

New to this edition is ""On In the Mood for Love,"" which features an interview with film critic Tony Rayns. He puts the film in the context of Wong's career and how personal a work it is to the director. Rayns points out that Wong drew on his experiences of growing up in Hong Kong during the `60s.

The other new extra is ""The Soundtrack,"" which features Rayns talking about the film's richly evocative soundtrack. Wong chose a mix of pop songs, Nat King Cole, waltzes and original instrumental music. You can also listen to 12 tracks from the soundtrack.

Finally, there are television spots from Hong Kong, the United States and France as well as trailers from these three countries.",1350864000,10,3428,5.20508166969147

1328652,5,B00003CXUM,"I had no idea who Wong kar-wai was when I saw IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE at an international film festival in 2000. Nor was I familiar with actors Tony Leung Chiu-wai or Maggie Cheung. Or cinematographer Christopher Doyle. So I had no idea what to expect. Which may be the best possible frame of mind to be in when about to encounter the sublime...

A gorgeous, atmospheric, sensual and very artful film, it centers on a man and a woman who rent rooms in the same home in cramped Hong Kong, 1962. Each is married, though we don't see their spouses. In fact, we don't really see many other people, and we usually see the two in close quarters, whether together or apart - at home, at work, in the street, in a restaurant, in the back of a cab. There is much to this film beneath its lush, color-saturated surface...it is a mesmerizing exploration of repressed desire, the other side of infidelity...and lost time.  Wong's use of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack, singing in Spanish, is inspired.

Since seeing IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, I've made a point to see Wong's other films (and own some of them): DAYS OF BEING WILD (1991), CHUNGKING EXPRESS (1994), HAPPY TOGETHER (1997) and 2046 (2004). Wong kar-wai is one of the great contemporary auteurs and I look forward to his upcoming release, THE GRAND MASTER, starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Zhang Ziyi.

I've also sought out other films featuring the great Tony Leung Chiu-wai (who has won 5 Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Actor and 2 for Best Supporting Actor) and Maggie Cheung (winner of 5 Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Actress); the two appeared together in the 2002 Zhang Yimou epic, HERO.

1328653,4,B00003CXUM,"In the Mood for Love is exquisitely photographed, and there's fine acting from all. Best is the wonderful screenplay, depicting a sadness and frustration that can only be interpreted by the viewer. It's not a million laffs, but a character study worthy of consideration. Tony Leung is fine; Maggie Cheung is terrific, handling all this upset with dignity and grace. This took place in '62, so maybe traditions were different then; the claustrophobic setting added angst. Wonderful supporting characters. I rented the film because of all those awards it received; maybe I expected more. Don't watch if their are distractions (kids, phones, etc.)",1286236800,,644,5.262135922330097
1328654,4,B00003CXUM,"This is one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen.  The movie is worth watching for its intricate textures, rich colors, lovely compositions of light and shade, and wonderfully complex backgrounds.  The story, however, is a little bit faint.

1328655,5,B00003CXUM,"This movie is my absolute favorite of Wong Kar Wai.

The visuals are stunning, the actors are great, and its twisted and sadistic and yet still turns out to be a tender love story . Wong Kar-Wai's use of slow mo on So's gloved hand while walking in the street is an image that I could stop and rewind and stop and rewind a thousand times over and never tire of it...

It's simply beautiful...

1328656,5,B00003CXUM,"There is a recurrent sound of a sensual waltz that accompanies each encounter between Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) as they invariably cross paths in a crowded residential complex: the first is a polite glance as Mo-Wan leaves the room of a friendly card game; and then during the subsequent encounters on the steps of a noodle shop, where, often denied dinner companionship by their spouses, they stop for a quick meal. One evening, Mo-Wan asks to meet Su Li-zhen in a restaurant, admires her purse, and asks where he could buy one as a present to his wife. She explains that it is a gift from her husband that was purchased during a recent international business trip, and is not locally available. Su Li-zhen, in turn, asks Mo-Wan about his tie, and he responds that it is a gift from his wife. The subtle, underplayed moment is a knowing confirmation of their own nagging suspicions about their spouses' infidelity. The two begin to rehearse scenarios in order to prepare themselves for the seemingly inevitable emotional confrontation: who initiated the affair; how to broach the subject of infidelity; how to react after the shattering admission. When Mo-Wan decides to pursue a lifelong dream of writing a martial arts serial in order to pass the time, Su Li-zhen agrees to proofread his work. However, when their professional collaboration leads to an undeniable attraction, the two find themselves struggling with the shame and guilt over their own emotional betrayal.

Using graceful slow motion sequences and nostalgic music, Wong Kar-wai juxtaposes the romanticism of a lost era with the unrequited longing of an impossible relationship in In the Mood for Love. Wong's highly stylized camerawork serves as a visual foil to the chaos of the meticulously structured mise-en-scene: the crowded living conditions, overly familiar neighbors, and imposing, uninvited guests reflect the claustrophobic, intrusive nature of traditional society. In contrast, the suffused colors of the empty restaurant and the long, reverse tracking shot of the hallway leading to Mo-Wan's creative retreat reflect the uninhibited freedom of their surfacing emotions. Furthermore, Su Li-zhen's seductively bold and exquisitely tailored high collared dresses manifest her paradoxical character: passionate, yet reserve; sensual, yet conservative. In essence, the visual dichotomy of the film serves as a reflection of the emotional turmoil that results from their innocuous alliance. In the Mood for Love is a subtly intoxicating and hypnotic film on love and longing, fate and destiny, connection, and isolation.",1262822400,6,2625,5.340579710144928
1328657,5,B00003CXUM,"There are few films that can match internal beauty with visual splendor quite like Wong Kar-Wai marvelous `Fa Yeung Nin Wa'; a film that is intoxicatingly rich in character development as it is in the vast array of color splashed across each of Maggie Cheung delicately designed garments.

The film tells of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan, two neighboring tenants in an apartment building in Hong Kong, circa 1962.  Though they only meet and or converse in passing they soon uncover that they have a terrible reality in common; their spouses are engaged in an affair.  Determined not to fall into the same trap of infidelity, they form a close platonic bond with one another, frequenting the same restaurants and spending a lot of time talking and confiding in one another.  There is an apparent chemistry, and it becomes obvious that there is a longing for one another, but they remain at a distance so as not to disrespect their own dignity.

What we are left with then, is a breathtaking look at restrained affections.

I want to just take a minute to talk about director Wong Kar-Wai.  I've made statements before in my reviews of `Chung Hing Sam Lam' and `My Blueberry Nights' that I didn't understand what the draw was to this director, and that my experiences with those two particular films made me question whether I should look into his work anymore.  This film alone is so incredibly good (seriously, one of the top twenty films I've EVER SEEN) that it makes up for any previous concerns and or notions I've had towards this director and compels me to watch everything he's made.  I don't see how he could ever top this (or how any director could really top this) but I am more than willing to give the rest of his films a go.

Why, you ask.

What Wong Kar-Wai does here is effortless transference of emotional connection.  In other words; he paints such a vividly captivating picture that he evokes in us an immediate reaction, playing on our own internal feelings and drawing out of us a personal connection to the events unfolding on the screen.  With images that linger on the screen for long periods of time; symbolic clouds of smoke lifting to the ceiling; rich expressions of color gracing a dimly lit room and that constant emotional tenseness that just captures the ultimate meaning in it all; `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' is so incredibly detailed that one could watch it multiple times and still catch something new with each sitting (case and point; I've seen in four times this past week and I still feel it has so much more to tell me).

The material is elegantly handled by its two stars, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung.  Both actors have proven themselves time and time again, but this may be their most committed and ultimately most rewarding performances.  They each understand their characters, the pain of betrayal, the fear of loneliness, the desire to be complete.  They just `get it' and so each scene is elevated by their emotional connection to the material.  Cheung is especially captivating, delivering one of the best performances of the year with her smoldering internal struggle to fulfill herself.

I recommend this film without any hesitation and plead with you to see it.  There are few films that can achieve what `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' has achieved.  This is an emotionally stimulating visual feast that is as thought provoking and intelligent as it is beautiful.",1238630400,3,3383,4.729131175468484
1328658,5,B00003CXUM,"You will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. This movie is breathtakingly beautiful and it showcases some of the best acting on earth. Much of the story is told with body language and facial expression rather than with words, and the direction and cinematography are brilliant. In my opinion, this is one of the all time greatest movies ever filmed.",1230422400,,359,4.625

1328661,5,B00003CXUM,"This movie is simply enchanting.  The director's consummate use of color, the musical score, and the detailed attention to the historical setting -- 60's Hong Kong -- was sublime.  The main characters are statuesquely beautiful and Mrs Chan, in particular, is delectable in her body hugging dresses (qipao). The real thrill is the story line: erotic, without being coarse, passionate and sensual without being prurient, provocatively sexy and yet moral.  Its a refreshing change from the lascivious drivel that we often endure from Hollywood.  Interview excerpts in the second CD (Criterion collection), especially the director's commentaries, as well as the alternative endings are both revealing and captivating.",1219017600,4,714,5.644859813084112
1328662,5,B00003CXUM,"As many have said, the cinematography is visually stunning and really sets the mood, akin to a smoky jazz club and you're the only one there, except there are no jazz clubs in the movie and there are actually two people... neither of them you.  These people are Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung.

Some detractors of the movie claim it to be too slow or boring.  Yes, it is a very slow moving piece and if you have a short attention span, you have to take that into consideration.  If you do find that you are afflicted with ADD, try this... absorb the two main characters' acting style, notice the details, see how much they can convey through facial expressions and postures.  That alone can carry the movie, the complex desires of what is not said... or rather what is said verbally but expressed differently.  I'd say Tony and Maggie put on the best performance I've ever seen in any movie.

To those who found it boring and lacking plot, I kindly disagree with you.  While you can watch the movie and get blown over questioning the existence of subtext and symbols (some of which may be nonexistent), wondering what anything means, the movie DOES have a plot.  At the core, it is about two neighbors discovering that their respective husband and wife are having an affair AND how they come to terms with this: the little games they act out in hypothetical confrontations with their spouses, the little scenarios they act out as they puzzle over how a relationship begins, and finally the distractions they put play to put the affair out of their minds.

In particular, you may find it quite interesting and also quite realistic watching them come together by this betrayal and over time, growing fond of each other.  If you are watching this movie for the Big Breakdown or a Dramatic Fight That Clinches Everything, you won't find it here.  But there are many other pieces that can move your heart.  Additionally, the dialog has a poetic cleverness at precise moments, allowing for it to be taken both literally and figuratively.

Quite beautiful.

One thing I thought worked very well for this movie is how ambivalent the ending is.  Unlike Chungking Express where the movie ends on a definitive note or at a definitive point for each character, this movie plays more like real life.  There are no actual 'endings' and there's always the potential for great joy or missed opportunity.  If you didn't like this movie the first time around, give it another go with some patience.  Admittedly, the first time I watched it I wasn't 'in the mood for love' and had to set it aside.  Subsequent viewings have led to a deeper appreciation.  Make sure you are inclined to be receptive.

Good luck!",1201564800,10,2689,4.6645435244161355
1328663,5,B00003CXUM,"In the Mood for Love has to be rated one of the best films ever made. The film is a visual feast -the art direction, lighting, sets and most of all the wardrobe are stunning. The story line  of two people meeting by chance and how in someway are forced into each others company. The main highlight of their story is the complexities of relationships and loyalties - two very profound life matters which test us on a daily basis. The actors performance is mesmerizing. There's not much dialogue and much of it is left to your interpretation.  The film's chemistry is focused in its visual presentation including the story and its dialogue - you pretty much feel like your looking through a visual and emotional kaleidoscope.",1200528000,,723,4.68503937007874

1328665,4,B00003CXUM,"Every metaphor is in Wong Kar-Wai's amazing directing and coloring. To
which, successfully evolves a flummoxing emotions between Maggie and
Tony to audiences. There are several significant scenes I like:

Scene 1: A kind of relationship reveals when Maggie's husband only
vocally appears in the movie. Maggie's gently scratch over her leg
after her husband gets up for a change hints prior sex. During this
time, the scene was viewed through a door seam that leads a
restraining,or suppressing atmosphere. Later on, the director also uses
this technique taking the eyes of camera through windows, fences, veils,
etc.

Scene 2: the rice cooker. Gathering for meals is an important thing in
most oriental cultures. Maggie is often alone and lack of connection
with her husband while her friends' dinner scene provides a juxtapose.

Scene 3: the clock, the rain (water), and diurnal eat-and-out suggest
the time. Time concedes a vastly recurring mise-en-scene.

Scene 4: albeit the lack of his countenance, the smoke of cigarette
surrounding by Tony gives an invisible projection of his perplexing
thoughts.

The whole scene: speak it all a conservative year back in 1962. No
strong physical affection back then, yet the intense love and
affection ferment deeply inside these two protagonists.

It is a beautiful film and also a good study material for students in
film majors.",1196294400,,1374,5.1945701357466065
1328666,5,B00003CXUM,"Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love is a beautiful film in every since of the word.  From the wonderful performances to the beautiful cinematography, In the Mood for Love is an excllent example of crafty filmmaking.

The film is about two couples who move in on the same day.  After finding out that their spouses have been cheating on them with each other, they form a great friendship and intimate bond.  But that's just the surface.

The two disc criterion release deatures a plethora of materials.  A few deleted scenes, a feature on the music of the movie, which is also haunting and beautiful, an esaay, and many more featurettes on the second disc.  Also included is a booklet with a story that inspired the film.  Plus, there's a short film from the director as well.

1328667,4,B00003CXUM,"One of the reasons I love Wong Kar-wai is that he has an amazing ability to write good smooth dialogue. Even if the film lacks in other areas like picture quality for one, he takes your mind off of that by focusing on these characters and their cool conversations. He creates what I believe are magical scenes of emotion between these characters with his charming writing. The actors he casts are perfect, no wonder why he sticks with them. Especially Tony Leung who sets the mood with his smooth style but I must say Maggie Cheung has equal skills here. In the Mood for Love is extremely simple, two couples meet in a Hong Kong when they become next door neighbors in an apartment building.

Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) who is a journalist meets Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) a secretary when they move in on the same day in the apartment. The two have a few things in common like they are both married to people who work all the time or at least this is what they think. Chow and Mrs. Chan's spouses are both cheating on them with each other. Yes that sounds really crazy but that's what happens. The two find out the well kept secret and then begin developing their own relationship and become close friends. Throughout the film I kept wondering when all these things were happening. I felt like this movie could've been so much better if you had a slight clue that something was going on between the Mrs. Chan's husband and Mr. Chow's wife.

You watch the film not knowing the plot so some may be suspect to turn the movie off before it develops because it takes to long for the conflict to be exposed. Also when your told the two are cheating it's too simple, Mrs. Chan says something like ""I can't believe they were together"". You never even get to see their spouses; you just hear their voices, which is not so cool. You'd like to see them together to actually understand and really believe the situation. Mrs. Chan talks to Mr. Chow like a close friend after making clear that she was distant from him because of her own loneliness. You can tell an amount an unexplained ammount of time passed. She attaches herself to him too quickly and it creates a bit of an unrealistic feeling in the film.

On a more personal expectation I wish the relationship between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow could have had more to it than what it had. I hope people don't get me wrong when reading my review because I liked this film but to me it could have been so much better. I rate it high because I love the direction from Wong Kar-wai. The way he puts his characters in environments where they have to be near each other. He gives them good deep dialogue where they pick each other's brain and get to know themselves. He makes them feel like real life people. I also love his settings, choice of music, and camera angles. I want to like this movie and did but I saw a few flaws that took away from it. The loose sequel 2046 shows that Kar-wai learned from his mistakes with this film. I believe some people will love this film, some will like it, and some will not but either way you will have to be in the mood for In the Mood for Love.",1192752000,,3118,4.344768439108062
1328668,5,B00003CXUM,"Even though this was on the list of my movies to review, it was not on top of the stack. But today I had a conversation with one of my friends about moral high ground. That prompted me to pick this up.

This is an old(er) movie. But not many may have seen it. So this is my way of recommending it to all the readers of this blog.

Also in a time where morality seems to be measured by whom (race, gender etc) you love rather than by how you love, this movie speaks volumes.

The plot is fairly simple. A simple story of neighbors - a man and a woman, who find out that their spouses are having an affair. Somehow this catalyzes a strong friendship between them. And that is the only thing simple about this movie.

The treatment of the movie makes the viewer almost feel like a voyeur - lurking behind doors and corners watching them as they keep denying their longing and love for each other. By the latter half of the movie one is rooting for them to shake off these bonds and embrace their attraction.

The movie is set in the 60's Hong Kong, a time when women still wore beautiful dresses and men were gentlemen who wore suits and jazz was the preferred genre of music. (I always contend that the world was a much better place when men wore suits and listened to jazz.)

One is driven to think ""Why don't they get together? Their spouses are already cheating on them.""

That is where their sense of true fidelity and decency comes to the fore. It makes the case that morality is not a relative term. It is a set of ideals that one has to strive for no matter what turmoils surround you. And using someone else's immoral conduct to justify one's behaviour is just a poor excuse for our own weaknesses.

'Random Hearts' starring Harrison Ford and the oh-so-beautiful and charming Kristin Scott Thomas, did try to explore a similar subject. But for any story dealing with human emotions, subtlety is the key. And Wong Kar Wai literally gives an education about the art of silent glances and unspoken emotion in this movie

My final word on this is a quote from this movie itself.

""You notice things if you pay attention""",1186790400,8,2122,4.362944162436548
1328669,5,B00003CXUM,"Wong's lush romantic melodrama is an achingly gorgeous homage to unrequited love. Though Chow and Chan are drawn to each other, personal morals and social propriety prevent them from acting on their attraction--a tension Wong exploits masterfully, evoking their desire with hushed phone conversations, furtive looks, and a heavily eroticized scenario in which they pretend to be the cheating lovers, play-acting an adultery they won't indulge. Beautifully shot by Chris Doyle, every frame of this film hums and throbs with eroticism. An art piece as much as a story of longing, ""Love"" is smart, sexy, and atmospheric.",1184803200,2,617,5.371134020618556
1328670,3,B00003CXUM,"I was more engrossed in this film than I should have been. It has a very simple plot. No twists and turns. Just the one question: ""Will they or won't they?""

Basically, it's the prolonged musings of a man and woman thrown together because their spouses are having an affair. They, however, seem too principled to give into their own obvious chemistry.

Like the other Wong Kar Wai films I have seen, this is beautifully directed and photographed. It is set in Hong Kong of the 1960s, therefore, vaguely familiar to us Westerners who remember the 1960s.

To be honest, if I watch it again, it will be to revel in Maggie Cheung in the form-fitting cheongsom dresses popular in Hong Kong the 60s. (She's also very pretty in the special features contained on the DVD.)",1183507200,5,764,4.602941176470588

Well, I have to say that this movie by far exceeded my already grand expectations of it. It truly is like entering a dream in which you feel like a close spectator of a reality that defies reality. You know it is not real; yet, you can't help but stare and believe. The scenary is just something that will haunt you for days. The music is just amazing and complements the visual effects very well. It adds to the surreal  dream-like aura. The dialogue does not waste a single line. From the get-go, we are being seduced into a trance that allows the movie to capture us and take our imagination to another place. This movie is like a hallucinogenic that allows us to marvel at the simplest of things like the sound of a heavy rain. It has taught me that sometimes you say the most by not saying much and just listening and observing. That's what you should all do...get this movie, listen and observe.",1176854400,3,1046,4.336734693877551
1328674,5,B00003CXUM,"Wong Kar-Wai's ""in the mood for love"" is, as its title suggests, a study of this human experience we call love. But is not, unlike the title (which alludes to a famous western love song and western loves songs are elemental to the plot) and its surface plot line suggests, limited to romantic love. It does, in fact, depict the lifeline of a seemingly tragic unconsummated love affair but in the process of this exploration meditates on a range of human emotions and feelings and ways of being. I say seemingly tragic because although the lovers do not live ""happily ever after"" and the hero rides off into the sunset alone they are both, in fact, liberated from illusory existence in the process. Furthermore, the film considers what it is that constitutes love be it romantic or altruistic; examining such aspects as sincerity, truth, concern, loyalty, trust, honesty, and, of course passion. It is a study of the roles that we mortals and fortune play in our different relationships both as individuals and members of society. And, echoing ""Casa Blanca"" it is a buddy flick to boot; staged during the turbulent East of the sixties. His friend, although a comedic sidekick, is also a somewhat pragmatic earthy confidante who serves a drunken master/monk's role. This symbolic image is repeated towards the end when a Buddhist monk is the sole witness to our hero whispering his secret to the mountain. The extended ensemble of neighbors and workmates that serve as boundary lines, backdrop and compass points are also major cast components. Even French President, Charles De Gaulle and Nat King Cole make significant appearances via documentary footage and soundtrack. The film is informed by both Zen Buddhism and post post modern physics both in regards to the space/time continuum it explores as well as the cinematic techniques employed to do so. The freeze frames and blurs employed to punctuate and slow ""reality"" were especially effective as were the chapter titles and soundtrack. But more importantly the plot and dialogue themselves serve to simultaneously focus and distort to more accurately depict reality as evidenced by the role playing that isn't role playing as well as the mirrored images. ""in the mood for love"" is a meditation on how to be both in love and in life and it makes the point that we are by what we do and in the process, if lucky, we be.",1174262400,,2372,4.873762376237623

1328676,5,B00003CXUM,"The story is set in the early 60s.

The landscape, the music, the scenery are perfectly set to remind us of those years when things were changing and new values were created.

During those years, the freedom in relations was also accompanied by the respect to the values of the generation before.

In this environment of challenging changes, two couples move in an apartment block in Hong Kong.

The spouses of both couples are very successful in their own business and careers and often travel overseas.

Soon it is understood that the ""often-travelling"" spouses have an affair.

The remaining two, who are busy with their daily life in Hong Kong while their spouses are travelling, find comfort in their growing friendship.

One can imagine that the fact that their spouses have an affair might have tempt them to act in a way to either confront them or to have an affair themselves.

And yet, the obvious appears to escape realisation.

Despite the attraction between them, despite their wonderful friendship and their bitterness over the way their spouses behaved, they keep their dignity and respect above all.

They share so much and they enjoy moments of silence, loving conversation, eating together, visiting the street vendor for noodles, and sharing an umbrella in the tropical rain, and all this ""in the mood for love""

This mood for love is constantly in the air and it is expressed in more that one way.

The conversations, the cinematography, the impressive music, are all elements, which are reinforcing this ""mood"" that remains in the air until the very last second of this magnificent film.

Sad and loving, emotional and strong, soft and sensual, this film is moving slowly at its own pace and keeps the viewer attached to the story from the very first second to the very last.

Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" is a remarkable piece of work - sensuous but not showy, restrained but highly intriguing, and satisfyingly unresolved.  I dare anyone who considers themselves a film connoisseur to watch this and not be impressed.  Every shot is expertly framed, every color and costume choice agonized over, every piece of music is nothing short of appropriate.  The performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung and are superb and often, more is said with a lingering expression than dialogue could ever convey.  Their chemistry isn't just realistic; it's electric.

Now to be perfectly clear, not everyone will like this movie.  It simply lacks the comforting elements that make the usual Hollywood tripe palatable to the masses.

1328680,4,B00003CXUM,"Kar Wai Wong's lyrical 2002 nostalgia piece is almost tailor-made for this beautiful Criterion Collection edition because of its complex historical and cultural allusions, which are perhaps not readily understood by many Western viewers, that its very simple narrative structure belies. In 1962 Hong Kong, the Chans, a couple from Shanghai, move into an apartment with other Shaghai emigrs where they live down the hall from Chow Mo Wan, a newspaper editor, and his wife. The film is told almost entirely from the perspective of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Leung), who slowly come to realize (as the viewer does) that their spouses are having an affair. The two main characters come together first to commiserate, but they slowly come to fall in love with one another... yet their refusal to be ""like"" their faithless spouses prohibits them from committing to one another fully. The film is constructed like a puzzle, with many scenes scene from just around a corner, or down a hall, or through a nook or alcove. The deliberately slow pacing (underlined by the score's use of a beautiful but maddeningly repetitive waltz theme on the cello) can be a bit soporific, and you can find yourself after a while fixating on the showstopping series of spectacular cheongsam Maggie Cheung wears. (""She can't possibly top this one,"" you'll think after each scene, and then she will.)

But like Resnais's LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD (which this film seems at times to evoke quite consciously) or Akerman's JEANNE DIEHLMAN, part of the point of IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is to change your perception of temporal understanding, and to stay with this film and accept its tempo is to enter its world where the passage of time changes because of the story it depicts. The film's ending has been controversial because of its abruptness and dissimilarity, but this too is part of Kar Wei Wong's point, and the alternate endings this Criterion edition appends greatly helps a confused viewer understand what's going on. So too do the fine essays by Chinese film scholars which helps clarify the rich historical framework of Hong Kong and Shanghai in the mid 20th century, and also the melodramas of the 30s Shanghai cinema to which Kar Wei Wong pays homage.",1140739200,4,2244,4.905263157894737
1328681,5,B00003CXUM,I know that some reviewers are going to slam this movie calling it a stylish soap drama. But really have you seen the soap dramas imported from China courtesy of PBS? I have and there is no comparsion to be made between the two. The colors of the clothes and scenery are breathtaking. The awkward but shy glances that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan share between one another before entering their almost conjoining apartments back to their cheating spouses. Even the strange but delightful way their friendship starts in order to uncover the motives behind way her husband and his wife ever cheated on the both of them in the first place. I especially love the part where Mr. Chow informs Mrs. Chan that he is moving to Singapore to write for their newspaper. The look of shock and disappointment in her eyes and how she tries to discourage him from moving away. I am not going to spoil the end of the movie but I will say it broke my heart.,1140220800,6,933,4.430232558139535
1328682,4,B00003CXUM,"I would strongly recommend the readers to get the DVD with extra features in it.  After watching the ""Interview with the Director"", then, we would come to appreciate more the subtleties in this movie.  To put it simply, the Chinese title for this movie was ""Hua Yan Yuan Hua"" which implied ""the flower at its gloriest moment"".  For some, it's interpreted as a woman's finest moment but for the Director, it meant two things, Hong Kong's finest hour (Director's nostalgia towards the 60's when he was growing up as part of the Shanghainese community in Hong Kong escaping from Cultural Revolution in mainland China) and the finest hour between Maggie and Tony's characters.  To get the ""look"" in the movie, he scouted for locations in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Cambodia.  He also explained the rationale behind ""2046"" and that some scenes from that movie was shot simultaneously together with ""In the Mood for Love"".  It's more due to logistics rather than creative interest.  He was not afraid to admit the argument that he had with Tony and Maggie on how to portray the characters through gestures rather than dialogues, and the necessity of doing this movie with a ""point of difference"" when there were already many other movies made about affairs.  Then, there were clues been left for the viewers to understand that time was moving on with different vegetables and dishes been consumed by the Shanghainese in different seasons of the year in the movie.  It's also quite interesting to note that this movie evolved from another movie that he originally wanted to do about food, and involving three different group of people only to be refined into this one particular story subsequently.  Obviously, the Director had enormous passion and love for this movie and he specified that if he didn't set a target to show this at the Cannes as a closure, this movie would have gone on forever.  Without a doubt, the framing, the intimate angles and close-ups, the lighting, the composition of the movie layered with the ""Yumeji"" soundtrack (Dreamlike) followed the rhythmic movement of the actor and actress scene were achingly beautiful to watch.  Don't be startled when he indicated that he was inspired by Kurosawa who was specific about details and in this instance, he wanted to emulate that through subtleties but the clues were always there.  Some friends of mine found this movie daft and boring because of the thin storyline: two persons converged together to cope for the infidelity of the spouses and yet, they found love from one another and was never meant to be.  Then again, God is in details.  Perhaps, it's a visualist movie and not meant for everybody's liking at the first place.  All I know is that I love it and that's enough.  I think it's ideal to watch this movie with no expectation in the beginning but soon after, with commentaries given by the Director, then, we would be able to see this movie from a new light.  Highly recommended and one of my top pick of the year.  An unmissable experience.",1139875200,7,3017,4.812015503875969

1328685,5,B00003CXUM,"A user before me has warn you not to watch the deleted scenes. Lucky of you, nobody told me that on time.

This is a beautiful movie by any standard: the colors, the mood, the story, the acting, the soundtrack -at the same level of the one in Kieslowski's Three Colors: Red-. Image is sharp and the sound is clear.

It tells the story of an impossible love. It is not impossible because of the circumstances, but because the characters have decided to deny their feelings. They are married to other people, but they love each other. Their couples are being unfaithful to them, but they don't want to do the same thing.

Every time they try to talk about their feelings the camera shows them as if they were at jail, behind bars (usually the bars from a window). That's what's happening to them: they are trapped because they have decided to. Of course, the bars are not really there, they're free to do whatever they want to, but they have to prove that they're different, that it is possible to defeat temptation.

The DVD comes in two discs: disc one is the movie itself, disc two comes with a lot of extras. All the extras are worthy... except the deleted scenes. All the charm and the sadness of the story in disc one is destroyed by these scenes that should've never been filmed. This is one of the best examples of the importance of editing the story, as the movie gained a lot of points by delivering something very different and shorter than the original idea.

1328686,5,B00003CXUM,"""It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away.""

-Opening Line

An attractive, slender Asian woman with a striped, fitted 60's collared dress and upswept hair walks in slow motion holding a tiny Convertible-blue thermos by its thin chrome handles, down the street, down the stairs, near you, past you- without a single glance. The street sounds disappear and the only thing you hear is a repetitive, painfully sweet, tango-esque tune that saturates your imagination every time you think of her, every time you see her, every time she walks up and down that long and narrow flight of stone steps. You pass her again-this time it's within the narrow flight of stairs. Today she's wearing a green (but tinted with red) dress cut in the exact same oriental style and has the same blue thermos dangling off of her fingers. You turn towards her as she passes.

Set in Hong Kong circa 1960, Wong Kar Wai's story depicts what happens after two individuals find out that their spouses are cheating on them. They engage in a game of role-playing to figure out what prior events could have led to their infidelities, with the intention of constraining physical interaction, but allowing their emotions to explore this intoxicatingly unconventional situation. Consider this one of the greatest movies of all time; if not for its innovative voyeuristic sophistication, at least for its mastery of making simple = more. The texture of this film is palpable for anyone who really knows what it is like to want what you shouldn't have, and purposely not taking what could so easily be yours. I couldn't find a better description than that which is detailed in the leaflet as a ""claustrophobic romance.""

On a technical note- its better not to see the deleted scenes in the special features. For anyone who has seen Terry Gilliam's Brazil and recognizes the impact of what an additional 5-second finale can do to the meaning of an entire movie, take my word for it.  In this case, it's desecrating. The less you know about how this movie could have been different, the better. For those of you who are skeptical and are more inclined to watch the special features now, think of Godfather III and try harder to dissuade yourself.  The other special features are good and include a short film tribute to great actors that have inspired Wong Kar Wai, using the ""happy birthday"" song from the movie.

Lastly, I wanted to mention that there is a scene at the end (which I won't divulge) that is made immensely better if you have a bass speaker in your sound system. It makes a huge difference. It starts at exactly 1:30:00 and involves a great cello orchestral piece, but there is a deep, visceral, drum rhythm that can only be felt with a bass speaker. You won't forget this scene, as it is also a conceptual lead-in to his sequel ""2046"", but in particular, you won't forget how you felt while watching/listening to this scene. I don't want to describe it more because its one of those things you just have to try.",1126742400,14,3104,4.673992673992674

The theme of forbidden passion in a rigid moralistic society is fairly common in Chinese films, here the visual and aural beauty gives it a massive kick in the @ss.

1328689,4,B00003CXUM,"I realize that there are a whole flock of folks out there who refuse to see a movie if it's in black & white.  Everything from vintage Chaplin to ""Casablanca"" to ""Raging Bull"" goes unseen by them because they're not in color.  In fact, I understand that a major reason why Peter Jackson remade ""King Kong"" is because many refuse to see the monochrome original.  These ignoramuses don't know what they're missing.

To the contrary, black & white cinematography is an utterly compelling way to convey the filmic image.  Like the visible brushstrokes in an Impressionist painting, black & white emphasizes the composition within the film's frame.  And although it puts the viewer at an arm's distance from the on-screen action -- black & white is not how most of us perceive the outside world -- it should not prevent us from becoming absorbed in a movie.  Black & white is cinema in all its primeval splendor.

I don't insist that every film I see be in black & white -- indeed, some of my favorite movies are in color -- but I'm sorry to see the monochromatic moving image vanishing from the big screen because there isn't an audience to support it.  Martin Scorsese originally wanted to shoot ""The Color of Money"" in black & white, but he was overruled by his producers.  When Brian De Palma had the same idea for ""The Untouchables,"" he met the same fate.  However, I think that some contemporary color movies would have been enhanced if done in black & white.

Which brings me to ""In the Mood for Love,"" a film in color.  Its director, Wong Kar-Wai, is one of my favorite filmmakers working today.  Furthermore, his movies would be unimaginable without the visual input of two longtime collaborators: production designer William Chang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  All of these gentlemen have my utmost respect, and I wouldn't want to second-guess any of their creative decisions.  Anyone who's experienced the whimsical whoosh of ""Chungking Express"" or the fish-eye introspection of ""Fallen Angels"" knows exactly what I'm talking about.

But ever since I bought ""In the Mood for Love"" on DVD, I've had the nagging thought that the film would look better in black & white.  Black & white would better evoke the film's setting of Hong Kong in the early 1960s, a time when infidelity was even more taboo than it is today.  Black & white would better capture the textures of the dilapidated city before its growth into a chrome-covered economic powerhouse.  Black & white would better convey the supression of love through its supression of color.  These thoughts crowded my mind every time I slid ""In the Mood for Love"" into the player.

Finally, I found the button on my TV set's remote that controlled the color, and I turned it all the way down.  Know what?  I was right!  ""In the Mood for Love"" is a better film in black & white.  All of my thoughts were confirmed.  There was something especially kinetic about seeing Maggie Cheung's luminous face emoting in a silvery monochrome.

Granted, ""In the Mood for Love"" was designed to be shot in color, and when viewed in black & white, the gray tones are particularly muddy in some scenes.  The faces don't ""pop,"" don't stand out in relief from the background, as they surely would have if they had been shot for the monochrome screen.  Also lost are the extravagant colors of Maggie's cheongsams (those form-fitting Chinese dresses), but their designs alone still pack a visual punch.  In fact, for a film shot in color, ""In the Mood for Love"" looks pretty darn good in black & white.

So, if you love black & white movies as much as I do, try watching ""In the Mood for Love"" on video with the color switched off.  See if you don't agree with me.  See if the film doesn't remind you of early-'60s Antonioni.  See if it doesn't better capture an era when women wore their hair above their necks and infatuation with another man's wife was a love that dare not speak its name.",1123804800,2,3935,4.670058139534884

1328691,2,B00003CXUM,"In the Mood for Love is entirely overrated.  I've been reading the reviews on here in amusement, as people dig beneath the surface for more than there really is.  Call it what you will (""evocative,"" ""langorous""); the film's pace is unbearably slow.  Though it heaps on the ambiguity with meaningful glances, unspoken words, and hesitant gestures, this tentative slowdance wholly failed to move, or even impress, me.  Naturally, as critics would have you, it is ""exquisitely understated.""  Wong Kar-Wai relies on the same techniques over and over again to drive home whatever point he's trying to make -- for example, slow motion shots of the willowy Maggie Cheung gliding down stairs as the violin-and-cello score is cued up.  It's haunting at first.  The 4th time around, it's redundant and self-indulgent.  Tony Leung won a Cannes Best Actor award for his performance, yet he never has to stray from the intense, stoic gravity he brings to most of his other roles.  Chris Doyle's mesmerizing, richly saturated cinematography is the only thing that prevented my eyes from glazing over completely.  Visual beauty, however, is not enough to redeem a film whose center is utterly hollow.  Wong Kar-Wai hints that there's more beneath the surface, but scratch that surface, and all you'll find is an artsy exercise in self-importance.  In short, it's a load of BS that's tempting to analyze to death.",1118620800,26,1397,5.0524017467248905
1328692,4,B00003CXUM,"This movie, filmed in Thailand in order to recreate the atmosphere of Hong Kong in the 1960s, manages to marry the claustrophobic mood of illicit, romantic longing to the sense of epic proportion that only memory can bring. Director Kar Wai Wang was first brought to the attention of many American viewers through Quentin Tarantino's enthusiasm for Chunking Express, a 1994 movie that harbingers some of the techniques employed in Mood For Love but registers nothing near the impact of this melodrama set mostly in the cramped confines of tenement houses and business offices.

Chief among these techniques are the slow motion shots and the discreet ruptures of time and sequence to emphasize the confusion inherent to the predicament of the two major characters. Where slow motion sequences in Wai's previous work were often halting, and combined with out of focus camera shots, in Mood they are languorous and intensely erotic as they follow swaying hips and swinging arms of characters simply moving from one room to another. These shots are usually close-ups at torso-level (front or back) and encourage in the viewer the kind of obsessive observations made by lovers in close quarters.

The action begins in 1962 as Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in to adjacent rooms with their respective spouses. Since the heart of the story follows their co-discovery and reactions to the adultery committed by these spouses, there is an element of surprise that evokes sympathy for the Chow and Su as they fumble their way through a web of tangled emotions within their private lives and struggle out from under the oppression of a society that places more burdens on them than on their sneakier spouses, whose faces are never seen and their voices never heard. No wonder that love soon blooms between them as well. On the pretense of writing a martial arts serial together they begin meeting more frequently, and their growing friendship is characterized in the movie by their unification within single frames, where they had hitherto been more often separated by individual shots. Their intimacy increases even as they remain faithful to their already broken marriages, and the poignancy of their choice is most evident in their efforts to keep their relationship secret.

The importance of secrecy is apparent when Chow shares with a co-worker a fable about confession rather than the details of his life. According to the story, in the old days, if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they went up a mountain, found a tree, carved a hole in it, and whispered the secret into the hole. Then they covered it with mud, and left the secret there forever.

Perhaps a three fourths of the way through the film moves forward: first to 1966, then to, and finally to Cambodia in 1966 following De Gaulle's visit to Phnom Penh. The era is vividly evoked by a soundtrack that includes Nat King Cole and other standards of the decade. Other staples of the mid-60's aesthetic are the bee hive hair doos and cheongsam dresses worn by Su.

Compared, say, to Adrian Lyne's `Unfaithful', or for that matter, Liv Ullman and Ingmar Bergman's `Faithless,' Wai's film seems both staid and daring in its treatment of adultery. It isn't that morality is sacrificed, but rather the full dimension of moral responsibility is explored in such a way that something more than titillation and lacerating guilt is brought to the drama. To pursue the story of the aggrieved partners is an interesting choice, if not totally unheard of. What makes it works so well is Wang's restraint, which is translated on film as the self-control of Chow and Su. This decision brings its own pain, as when he helps rehearse her for the eventual confrontation and revelation. As viewers we never see this confrontation: we are left to imagine it just as they imagine it. Of course we don't want to, any more than they do, and soon we are returned to the private life shared by them.

The final sequence observes Chow's pilgrimage to Angkor Wat, perhaps as a search for love and reconciliation on a religious plane. He's seen whispering into the hollow space of pillar, confessing his secrets in secret. Though we can't hear, we understand the significance of those whispers, and of such a mysterious ending to such a mysterious movie we are privileged observers indeed.",1118448000,3,4362,4.911804613297151
1328693,5,B00003CXUM,"Platonic relationships, in cinema as in real life, represent a nebulous, sometimes dangerous terrain: a sphere of carefully set-boundaries, of mutual appreciation that, on the surface, remains confined to the intellectual and the emotional, with the physical act of love itself banished from thought and action.  In real life this fragile balance is often upset by the gradual development of interior feelings - or by the repression of secreted urges - resulting in unrequited desire, in anguish and longing; in cinema, the temptation to milk this repression can often sink the material into the mires of overwrought melodrama, bathos, and clich.  It takes a talented, keen mind to carefully glean the poignancy of the platonic relationship, to avoid the pitfalls of tearjerking indulgence and the convoluted plot-twist.

Won Kar Wai's *In the Mood for Love* achieves this rare distinction, capturing platonic fidelity - and its inherent torments - with a sure hand and subtle perspective.  This is the second film I've seen of Won Kar Wai's, and he is quickly becoming my favorite director of Asian cinema; the delicateness of his approach, and the masterful juggling of experimental framing and intricate storytelling, is a wonder to behold.  This director fully understands the power of understatement, of allowing the audience to connect the dots, of achieving transcendence within tragic circumstances.  *In the Mood for Love* is a masterpiece, the epitome of the Romance, a genre I tend to avoid due to the overdose of manipulative schmaltz implicit in Westernized attempts.

The film follows the life-trajectory of two lonely Hong Kong residents in the mid-1960s, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su (Maggie Cheung), who discover that their respective partners are having an affair.  Seeking comfort from the brunt of these infidelities, the two embark upon a relationship of their own, sharing noodles and coffee, collaborating on a martial-arts newspaper serial and slowly drifting from the platonic nature of their affair into more complicated waters.  ""We won't be like them,"" is the mantra, the moral high-ground assumed; but it is never that easy, especially when instincts writhe beneath the impeccable surface of the ethical shield.

The acting is superb - Tony Leung radiates soulful hurt and gives his character a depth only hinted at by the script; Maggie Cheung is exquisite as the faithful wife trapped as much by social conventions as she is by her beautiful cheongsam garments.  Leung and Cheung are established names on the Hong Kong circuit - featured as conflicted lovers in *Hero*, for example - but they inhabit their dramatic personas so totally that one never refers to the other roles they have played; they avoid the artistic bane of overexposed fame, shatter the shackles of screen-iconolatry, and for two hours ~become~ Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su, a bereft pair we simultaneously root for, and root against, hoping they can maintain their platonic vow, hoping they will break it and reach fulfillment.

This paradox is further shaped into tense being by Wai's experimental perspective-shifts, playing with the 'truth' of the matter via multiple perspectives and isolated sequences.  Christopher Doyle's cinematography is in a class of its own, highlighting the storytelling aspect of the characters and environments without ever calling attention to itself; I recently read that Doyle loves to capture the beauty of women, spending hours to find the perfect angle, the defining frame: Maggie Cheung is exemplified by this painstaking technique.  The music completes the framework of *In the Mood for Love*: source music from the 60's floats in snatches, cementing the film to a tangible era, and Shigeru Umebayashi/Mike Glassoro `s evocative cello and violin score gives thematic counterpoint to that occurring on the screen.  Film is essentially a collaborative medium: when vital talents are assembled for a specific project, greatness occurs; the original vision is given depth and a grand eloquence it might not have achieved otherwise.  *In the Mood for Love* is a paramount example of this collaborative genius.

This Criterion edition contains several extras, including deleted scenes (which shred certain ambiguous elements; I'm glad they were deleted, and glad they were included here), notes on the music process, and a short tribute film by Won Kar Wai about the icons of Chinese cinema in the 60's.

In the Mood For Love calls for the very care she is referring to. As you pay close attention to the details it grows into a magnificent tale, the tale of an unlived affair.

Mrs Chan and Mr Chow infinitely postpone yielding to desire despite the strong magnetism pulling them together-maybe because they ""do not want to be like them"" or maybe because they want to be sure they are not doing this because they are angry with their spouses.

The rehearsal scenes where Kar-wai Wong plays a game of deception with viewer are ingenious. Before Mrs Chan is told by Mr Chow that ""they were merely rehearsals"" you are fooled into taking them for real.

The bittersweet, mysterious soundtrack proved once again the power music can have over af film. Much of the film's elusive atmosphere of impending doom is due to this amazing music. A pained Japanese waltz, and sexy Latin jazz work miracles.

However, the true revelation in this movie remains the fact of how much is understood, how much emotion is felt, all the while so little is said.

In conclusion, this film really left an impact on me. It left me feeling things I couldn't either explain or comprehend.

Bogart and Bergman cannot consummate their great love.  Brett and Scarlet can consummate, but the love part is tricky for Scarlet.  What I think I'm trying to say, everyone with a modest love life has fallen for that special someone that got away.  For the American audience, the resulting hurt is gripping in story or film.  We mourn lost love.  Well, the Chinese director Wong Kat-wai's gives us a Buddhist version of lost love.  It resembles mourning.

It is a platonic relationship despite the fact that they are very warm, attractive people. Indeed, Maggie Cheung is sultry hot in silk slit dresses with long legs and 1962 stiletto heels.  They vow not to be like their cheating spouses, but before long they are in desperate need of each other, but their previous declarations takes precedence.

The story is painted.  Think Toulouse-Lautrec meets Gauguin in Hong Kong.  The colors are dazzling and the scene set-ups are all about the artist's eye.  What was that Charles De Gaulle scene in Cambodia at the end of the movie?  What's with the Buddhist Temple as a Notre Dame Cathedral in Cambodia?  I can't be sure.  Perhaps it's Buddhist sophisms.  This film is not for fans of American romance, so be forewarned, but it is an exotic and fine piece of art.",1101340800,,1557,4.713754646840148
1328699,5,B00003CXUM,"Perhaps Wong Kar-wai's international attention has diminished viewers' perception of this sumptuous film. Like a star that outshines other nearby stars, people soon forget its intricacies and the wonder and nature of its possible existence.

""In the Mood for Love"" is like that intricately woven web of vapours, energies and intensities which shape and form that delicate but volatile atmostphere of a star, or ""mood"" in the film. It is what rises up to the surface, although our perception of which nonetheless mutates with each subsequent viewing. To say that Wong's films do not have a plot is not entirely true and sounds to me as a repeat of the often heard soundbytes from other viewers/reviewers. The thing is, Wong makes visible what other directors would rather not show, Wong's vision is that of an alternative version of the same story. And one that is told through images, colour, light, music, movement.

So, one may say that this is a story about Mrs Chow and Mr Chan's affair - the respective spouses of Tony Leung's and Maggie Cheung's characters - it is an affair which we (as audiences) do not and cannot identify with, as these characters are virtually nameless and faceless in the entire film.

So too, the characters that we do see in the film - Mr Chow and Mrs Chan - refuses to identify with this affair. But for them, try as they might to keep reality at bay, they are, nonetheless,  entangling and ensnaring themselves into a labrythine web that they themselves have spun -- by play-acting and role-swapping -- they have discovered their own yearning and desire/love for each other.

Like the four chambers of the heart - love, deceit, self-deception and desire circulate. But like a heart that has closed-in on itself, it is claustrophobic, suffocating and barely alive.

The movement and rhythm of the film is like that slow-waltz (the main theme of the film - Yumei's theme) and the ravishing cinematography - so close is that camera movement to that of Hou Hsiao-hsien's film ""Flowers of Shanghai"" (shot by the same DOP, Mark Lee Bing) that one is hypnotically absorbed into the fabric of the film, its colours, the texture and density of the images. Wong is building layer upon layer of memories, fictional and real, combining his own childhood memories of the 60's in Hong Kong to imagined memories that could only have come from a distant future - year 2000 of contemporary HK.

When you watch this film, please allow yourself the luxury of time, after all, Wong did take 18 months to make it. And Maggie said in a Chinese interview that without this time, she would not have been able to play Mrs Chan as she did, ""when my nails are painted a certain shade of pink, and my hair and makeup is done, my hands automatically place themselves in a certain way..."" I think this says much about the truth Wong translates on screen -- that it exists because of his patience with time. So, I guess it'll be nice to do him the same courtesy and make time to see this film - and let its mood absorb you for a while.",1099526400,5,3037,4.654850746268656
1328700,5,B00003CXUM,"If you like Maggie Cheung in Center Stage, you'll in the mood for her again in this visually stunniing and emotionally impacting period romantic film from WKW. It was perfect to cast her alongside with Tony Leung, because they had a great deal of chemistry and were vulnerable under the direction of WKW.

It's a beautiful film about adultery and meeting a stranger next door and falling in love again without an outcome. The scene when Tony Leung was pretending to be Maggie's husband and she had to act as though she had just found out about his secret affair. It goes something like:"" Are you sleeping with another woman?"" And Leung would respond:"" Are you crazy?! Who told you that?..."" was so funny and touching to watch. The two would eventually fall in love. I still can't forget when Leung called Maggie and said,"" If I have an extra ticket, would you come with me?"" Unfortunately, she didn't and they didn't divorce their cheating spouses. I wonder if the kid who appeared with Maggie in the old apartment building years later was the offspring of Leung and her. It's trully amazing to see two of HK's finest actors turning in a multi-layered performance without a script and the film was made on-and-off for 15 months which had driven Maggie to near insanity. Maybe that was how she gave such an intense performance. And you like fashion, Maggie worn at least 20 dresses in this movie.

The cover may be pricey but I'm telling you that it's all worth it, especially if you're a big fan of the film.  What made the dvd experience more exciting for me is the inclusion of deleted scenes, which really did answer all of my questions in the film.  Not to mention, the shock value these deleted scenes deliver.  This dvd definitely stands out.  It does deliver the value for your money.  I do encourage you to get it.

  I just want to respond to a negative comment, which said that there is no plot or that the plot is very shallow, and notice that only the cinematography and the art direction is being given praise.  If you're going to watch a Wong Kar-Wai film, you should know that the movie will not draw you with thick plots or plot-driven scenarios.  Wong Kar-Wai delves more on character development, which is always the base where the plot will eventually follow.  The magic of Wong Kar-Wai films is that it does not spoon-feed you with previously used plots.  His films are more like a jigsaw puzzle where he invites his audience to give his own view or understanding of the film.  The cool ambience and setting is merely an addition to the subtle but relatively wonderful plot each Wong Kar-Wai film has.",1097798400,4,1324,4.485355648535565

1328704,5,B00003CXUM,"'In the Mood for Love' is a touching, engrossing meditation on, you guessed it, love: what it is, what creates it, what ends it, what keeps it sewn strong together. All of these aspects are collected into a clever, lovely, sometimes devastating piece of artistry directed by the fabulous Wong-Kar Wai. Those of you who love romantic comedies or grand, epic love sagas will be immensely disappointed with his latest film. It is not either. Rather, it is a gem of cinema that strives for emotional truth and absolute realism. Inside of cramped apartments and old diners, that, too, is what the main characters of 'In the Mood for Love' yearn for.
The film takes place in Hong Kong during the year 1962. Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) have just moved into neighboring apartments and have met each other rather casually. But the two progressively realize a secret about their respective spouses and a profound relationship develops almost instantly. From there, the film sets a tone that is cislunar, seeming to float in its own world situated between reality and a sense of disconnection. Kar-Wai perfectly evokes this mood with fleeting slow-motion sequences accompanied by Christopher Doyle and Mark Li Ping-bin's delicately visceral cinematography. What ensues throughout the rest of the film (both plot-wise and technically) masterfully conveys romantic yearning.
The lead performances were breathtaking, namely Maggie Cheung as Su Li-zhen. From scenes of obvious hurt to moments of hidden despair, she ceaselessly astonishes. I'm surprised she did not receive the massive encomium she deserved from 2001 year-end awards groups, let alone the Oscars. But credit must also be given to Tony Leung as Chow Mo-wan, who managed to maintain a quiet, tired loneliness throughout the film. Leung also understood that it was only with Su Li-zhen that Chow Mo-wan felt truly alive with passion.
Another character worth mentioning are the breath-taking sets by production designer William Chang Suk-ping. The claustrophobic atmosphere offered by Suk-ping's dated, tight hallways was as much a part of the emotion and story line as each lead. Collectively, each part of the movie-making process (screenwriting, directing, designing, acting) achieved an assured concinnity; and in the end, what was already a personal, accessible study is lifted by Kar-Wai to a universal level using epic shots of Mayan temples and mysterious landscapes. As the credits role, it becomes apparent that 'In the Mood for Love' is arguably a masterpiece worthy of the all-time lists.
For me personally, the constant flashbacks of wind sifting past vinaceous curtains and artful conversations about love at its core only underscore 'Love's greatness. It is an unforgettably personal journey not to be missed.",1090195200,4,2800,5.29438202247191
1328705,5,B00003CXUM,"98 minutes of excellence. I am never a big fan for romantic films. Especially with the current scene filled with countless teen-or-chick flicks, I have become very picky on this category. I watched it with skepticism. 98 mins later, I switch off the TV in great relief, and also with understanding of why a few people do not enjoy it.
Generally, people who dislike this film have the following reasons:
1. Simple plot and no plot twist
2. Repetitive scenes
3. Few and confusing dialogues
4. No significant signs of intimacy or eroticism. Can it even be categorized into ""Romance""?
One thing I have learnt from ""In the Mood for Love"" is also the same thing I wish romantic film directors would learn for a long time: Character Study and Development are often more important than unnecessary plot twist. There are pretty much only two characters in the movie, but by middle the audience could feel as if we know them for real. Thus we do feel the characters' happiness, pain and suffering. Yes, even if the time is set in 1962, Hong Kong.
The repetitive scenes do not represent lack of creativity. In fact it is one of the hardest tricks in my opinion. Although some actions are very similar, each scene has a subtle change in intimacy and impact for future relationship. Not one of the scenes can be taken away because they're all crucial links. As for the dialogue, it is few but every line is to the point. Each word is polished to sharpest and kept to minimum. Every word is a keyword.
Intimacy and eroticism are indications and eye-candy. Audience would understand immediately two people are in love. In my opinion this is director's point of view to choose it or not. Wong Kar Wai deliberately wanted to create a longing relationship without obvious physical contact to add up the sadness. In fact, the film has at least once ""Implied Intimacy"". ***SPOILER*** When Su told Chow she did not want to go back home in the cab, that ""Implies""they would probably spend the night together ***SPOILER***
It could be artistic whether sex scenes are included or not. It just happens that WKW wants to present us a unique experience. I highly appreciate this effot. In the Mood for Love is a ten-level-upped romantic film and I definitely recommend it to every viewer, tertiary or not.",1083715200,15,2278,4.6975
1328706,5,B00003CXUM,"This is a love story set in China in the early 1960's. A man and woman are neighbours and discover that their spouses are having an affair. They meet to discuss, to commiserate, to comfort but finally fall in love. They don't want to be like their partners though. The movie is about passion, but also about restraint - how love can make us not act, rather than act. The scenes are beautifully shot, the costumes stunning and with the wet streets, the slow pacing and Nat King Cole singing Spanish in the background you are transported to another time. Often it felt more like an Italian film of the early 60's than a Chinese film made just last year. It is layered and rich in content and style. I have watched the DVD five or six times already and still discover more nuances with each viewing.
The Criterion Collection two-disc DVD is what DVD's are really meant to be. The making of featurette and the deleted scenes allow even deeper insights into an already intriguing film. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung at the Toronto Film Festival - you can really appreciate the charm of these two very talented actors.

1328707,5,B00003CXUM,"I was born in hongkong in 80's,and this movie portrayed the love between a journalist and his neighbour in 60's. Their love was unconventional when compare to the social taboo at that time. I found it the most fansinating that their attitude towards each other and the tone of their words were ambiguous!!After watching it,I search many pictures of Hong Kong in 1960's. They are wonderful and I love them so much. Nowadays,many hong kong students rare notice the bright side of Hong Kong in the past. They neglect the history and culture of Hong Kong. However,this movie , in fact, provided lots of pretty accessories and furniture in the 60's. They are incredible.
Besides,the sharp contrast of colour made by Wong was remarkable. The clothes were extremely beautiful and unique. The angle that Wong tried to shoot from the reflection of mirror was actually carrying out confusing ideas and ambiguities. Some of the scenes were blurred by rain ,shadow and smoke,maybe rendering a sense of escape and moral depravity of Chow.
Over all,the ending scene shot in AngKor Wat was excellent!!I love the quote ::: ""He remembers those vanished years.
As though looking through a dusty window pane,
the past is something he could see, but not touch.
And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct.""
Though they have no future , they had once continued sacrificing,or giving, simply for each other. The background music ""Theme"" was also a great supplement!!",1073692800,4,1449,4.991735537190083
1328708,5,B00003CXUM,"This Chinese film goes back to the recent past of Hong Kong, China and the Chinese. The love affair is delicate but it is not the essential element in the film, except as a metaphor for change, for the changing world. In those years (circa 1963) the world was changing but within a divided pattern, that of the two blocks and we feel this behind the scenes. The Shanghai community in Hong Kong, a symbol of the change in continental China. The family going to the US to visit their grandchildren, a symbol of the attraction of the US in those days, but also of the desire to go away from continental China and the danger some thought it represented. The visit to Cambodia and its sacred temples, with de Gaulle's visit in the middle of it in 1966, brings up the phantom of the Vietnam War behind this historical period. The spouses working in Japan or Singapore or Thailand shows the development of Asia in those days, led by Japan as the great industrial and commercial power it was becoming. But we have to think of the present. Things have changed so much. Japan is no longer the leading power in Asia. Hong Kong has found its place in continental China. Shanghai is more attractive than San Francisco. Cambodia has rebuilt its unity and independence after the tragedy represented by the intervention of the US on its territory and the subsequent bloody episodes. Today the Chinese are not emigrating abroad any more. They have become the engine of the development of Asia. This vision of Hong Kong in the early 60s emphasizes this change and the film is like archeology. The love affair then is symbolical of this evolution : the spouses emigrating to other Asian countries and having a love affair there ; the young man visiting Cambodia or even further and coming back not to discover, by lack of courage, what happened to the woman, though the film tells us about the son she got from her liaison with him, is a symbol of the complete beaking up of human relations in that world ; the vision of the Temples of Angkor, a Buddhist monk there, and the man burrying his secret in a hole in the wall plugged up with some earth, is a vision of very old traditions, beliefs and even superstitions, a world that has mostly disappeared. Very nostalgic. And the film is systematically invaded with music from Brazil or other distant, non Asian countries and in some foreign language that has nothing to do with Hong Kong. A symbol of the uprooting of this community brought by the divided world, but also announcing the globalization of the world that was to come at the time and is in the process of emerging today. The slowing down of some scenes makes these scenes look like some old dream, or old recollection, look like a mnemonic vision of a past that has disappeared.

1328709,5,B00003CXUM,"This is one of the most complete DVD packages I have ever seen ... something that couldn't have happened to a nicer film.
This package is one of few that takes advantage of what the DVD medium promised when it was launched. In the same small package all DVDs come in, the producers of In the Mood for Love somehow manage to include an array of the movie's trailers and posters from around the world, interviews with the major actors and director Wong Kar-wai, a second short film produced by Mr. Wong, an alternate ending to the story that had been under consideration, and director's commentary about all of it, along with a variety of subtitle options. There is also a special booklet that has the translated short story the film was based on, an essay about the film by a well-known Hong Kong critic and a very interesting (if unevenly translated) essay about the setting for the film by a local historian. All in all, a really amazing collection of information.
Of course, none of that would matter if the film it was all based on wasn't so darn good.
The story is wonderfully understated, told with deft simplicity and a delicate hand. On the surface, it's a relatively simple tale about two couples in neighboring Hong Kong apartments in 1962. Through circumstantial evidence, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover that their always-on-the-road spouses are having an affair -- a discovery that comes into focus as the stay-at-home half of each couple discovers the attraction each has for the other.
But the beauty of this film comes more from what is left out than what is put in. The dialogue is sparse, and the acting is elegantly austere. The faces of the unfaithful spouses aren't shown at all during the film, and the film's main conflict comes not when Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover they are being cheated on but when they fail to react the way most would expect.
Add to that unusual camera angles that at times pull the viewer into the scene and a haunting soundtrack guaranteed to stay in mind hours after the end of the film. The final result is a film that feels like a blend between an old classic and a modern masterwork, a recipe for great entertainment.",1062288000,,2170,4.609819121447028

Not too much plot to speak of, but with a mood so effective, who needs one?
Second viewing: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung turn in gorgeous performances (in every sense of the word) but Cheung particularly impressed me this time around. That could be because hers is the more outward performance, and Leung's is more internal. Both, however, were powerful.

1328715,4,B00003CXUM,"In the Mood for Love is such a charm despite a very simple plot. The year was 1962. Chow Mo Wan, a newspaper editor, recently moved into a dwelling populated by Shanghai immigrants with his wife. Through casual and accidental encounters Chow exchanged pleasantry with So Lai Jun (Mrs. Chan) who later found out about her husband's affair with Chow's wife. Heartbroken and devastated of the cruel truth, Chow buried himself in his job while So indulged in nightly movie screening. They began to let down the guard for one another and spent time during the mahjong sessions of their landlords. The characters forced themselves to abide by inveterate conventions and cultural morale that forbid an affair to become fruition. ...
Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung as usual deliver an impeccable performance in this 2001 Wong Kar-Wai release. Leung portraited a man who is unsatisfied about his marriage and denied his spouse's infidelity. Cheung seizes the empathy of her character who is accustomed to hush about reason for his husband's frequent absence. Maggie Cheung is elegant and charming in this movie. Not to mention the dazzling wardrobe she wears consistently over the entire movie. Her leg movements are captured in slow motion. Her arms dangling with the thermos meant for the late-night porridge order-to-go from the street vendor.
The movie is shot through a minimalist scope, that is, message is conveyed through very succinct scripts and imagery full of lush colors and meticulously chosen soundtracks. The film is shot in a very stealthy manner; it is as if a pin camera being fastened on the wall of the apartment. Conversations between Leung and Cheung are shot in an eavesdropping manner. The director seeks to de-emphasize other characters in order to focus on Leung and Cheung. Their spouse, respectively, always have their back facing the camera. Their performances are conducted by voices. The gaffer has done an excellent job adjusting the hues of light which is relatively dim throughout.
As a native of Hong Kong (born in mid-70s) who never witnessed the city in glory 60s, In the Move for Love has done me a favor in reminiscence. Wong Kar Wai makes sure everything is done just like when it was the 60s. Yes, even the restaurant menu to which Leung and Cheung skimmed through briefly. It was a green piece of cardboard decorated with some coconut tree clip art. Menu with such heavy Malaysian touch can still be found at local cafs that serve a fusion menu of Malaysian spices and sirloin steaks. Napkins are folded diamond-shaped like paper planes and kept at the far end of the booth. Leung and Cheung sip coffee from flimsy green chinaware cups that hold maybe three gulps. The green vinyl blinds hang unevenly at the office windows. The rotary phone. The subleased rooms where newly-wed couples rent and the kitchen with whom they share with their landlords. The white-collared wardrobe worn by housemaids. These are all the epitomes of lives in the 60s, in Hong Kong. Some find this mmovie a little slow-paced. I savor the manner in which the film is made. I savor all the details, the choice of colors and the tiptoeing scores in the film. 4.6 stars...",1048204800,80,3178,4.908921933085502

Because of this, a lot of people call this an ""art"" film. And for every people who say this is an excellent HK noir film, there are people who will insist that this is a boring, slow and shallow movie.
The story is simple. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and his wife move into their apartment on the same day that Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband move into the apartment next door. Initally, their relationship consists of passing pleasantries and mundane mahjong games with the neighbors. Soon, circumstances like their spouses' absence, and the suspicion that their spouses have a thing going on results in a friendship between the two. In the process, The two falls in love.
But this definitely isn't a love story. Remember, this is a Wong Kar Wai film. It's never a love story but rather a story about love. That love grows and eventually fades. That no one ever really does anything extraordinary or heroic for most of their lives. If you're looking for a good narrative story, rich character development, you will not find it here.
What you'll find are dark atmospheres/settings and conflicting emotions. Take note of the excellent physical details. The way Maggie cheung runs her hands thru her hair, the way smoke curls up from Tony Leung's cigarette, dark walls and alleyways on their way back home or from the noodle vendor.

The simple, yet somewhat complicated tale is both heartfelt and authentic.  And the performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are a marvel.  But it's none of these that really makes this film, it's rather the manner that Kar-Wai so magically molds all these factors to set a mood that I have never felt before while watching a movie.  In all honesty, I'm really not too fond of ""forbidden love"" movies, but this film really startled me.
Ironically, ""In the Mood for Love"" feels nothing like a Wong Kar-Wai film.  It's a very slow moving film which uses lots of fades and dissolves.  The Criterion edition of this film is probably the best dvd package I've seen to date.  There are just so many extras on it, it's hard to believe.  Deleted scenes, interviews, and promotional material, are just a few of the extras.  The way Kar-Wai shoots his films (without a script) also adds to the suprise of picture.  You see in the extras how much different the original concept was for ""In the Mood for Love.""  There is also an alternate ending that seems very plain, but at the same time very heartbreaking.",1023408000,127,1426,4.720647773279352

Soon Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover that their spouses are having an affair. Mutual commiseration developes into a guarded love veiled in trepidation. Not since L'Avventura have I seen a movie so beautifully shot, and Maggie Cheung gives a performance that rivals Maria Falconetti's in the Passion of Joan of Arc.
In the packaging there is a comment from the director that they did have troubles with the censors. In a couple of places in the film the information seems incomplete so it would seem that some scenes may have been omitted or shortened. Someone who has more background on the film would know for certain.

1328722,5,B00003CXUM,"""In the Mood for Love"" is simply one of the most beautiful films of the last several years.  I cannot praise this film enough - the plot is at once simple and complex, the characters are both real and heartfelt, and the images are powerful and elegant.  There really are so many positive things to say about this film, I'll try and hit the highlights for you.
The acting is superb - both Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung give impeccable performances filled with subtle emotion.  They radiate a quietly powerful intensity that is so lacking is a great number of film stars today.
The story moves in ways both expected and surprising.  The pacing is wonderful as the story unfold slowly before you.  They're none of the lighting fast cuts and manic pacing of most films.  It's a slower film for a patient audience willing to wait for their just rewards.  The overall design of the film with the use of color and wardrobe stunned me with it's rich simplicity.  The same can be said of the photography - rich with nuance (the way the shots are framed is remarkable) and feeling.
With ""In the Mood for Love"" Wong Kar-Wai has become one of the most skilled directors of our time with this film, proving that ""Happy Together"" (another brilliant film) wasn't a fluke.  The Criterion Collection edition of the film is a two disc set that has an astonishing number of extras.  After watching the film once, I watched the extras - then immediately watched the film again with a fresh eye to see how the entire thing was put together.

1328723,5,B00003CXUM,"I recommend the Criterion Edition of In The Mood For Love with no reservations.  I'd like to respond to a previous reviewer who criticizes the former work of Wong Kar-wai by suggesting the director imposes ""westernized"" forms on Chinese productions. Consider first that John Woo, of Hong Kong, ushered in an orchestral action vision through the Better Tomorrow films, The Killer, and Hard Boiled, which continue to influence ""western"" culture. And remember that films don't begin and end in ""western"" forms.  Wong Kar-wai, like many intelligent film-makers, makes use of multiple influences, including Woo, Godard, probably Pekinpah and others.  It's presumptuous and, I think, reductive, to imply an artist engages too much with something like ""westernized"" forms -- I'm not sure this has any meaning to begin with.  Luckily, most challenging and worthwhile film-makers are inspired by, know of, and pay homage to a variety of films and directors, ""western"" and otherwise. Wong Kar-wai is certainly no exception.  He's a young film-maker with impressive potential -- and a fine resume already.
  If you're only now coming around to Wong Kar-wai, I recommend not just In The Mood For Love, but Fallen Angels, Chungking Express, and Ashes of Time, among others.  And, of course, by all means try to get the Criterion Editions, if and when they're available.  Thanks.",1020211200,3,1365,5.224770642201835

1328726,5,B00003CXUM,"I had never seen ""In the Mood for Love"" and to be quite honest, was never a fan of Wong Kar Wai..I always found him to be a bit pretentious; as if he were trying to force Westernized techniques and cinematic fads into a Chinese mold...I never understood what the big deal about ""Chungking Express"" was...except for a totally awesome cover of the Cranberries ""Dreams"" in Cantonese by Faye Wong...
Well, with that said, I loved ""In the Mood for Love.""  Dreamy and sensual filled with rich fabrics and colors and music, it is truly a feast for the eyes ears and senses.  The story is heartbreaking, of two people who you just KNOW will never be together...this is well-established by the restricted mannerisms they adapt and the concern of image and reputation.  I don't even think they were fighting their feelings, but instead, they gently rode them out until it got to the point where it was just skirting a bit too close to the edge.
You probably have heard lots on the beauty of the film, which is why you are here reading customer reviews, right?  Or you must be a die-hard Criterion junkie.  But folks, this 2-disk set is THE most impressive package I have ever seen from Criterion.
Why?
Because on the second disk, you see Wong Kar Wai filming and you see the rehearsals and tons of deleted scenes that never made it onto the final cut.  And these are especially significant because they show us what a different film this could have been.  I am not sure if ""In the Mood for Love"" was a happy accident (which you may conclude after watching all the supplemental material), but I can say that the scenes that didn't make it shed a whole new light on the scenes that did.  You see Maggie and Tony reading the same lines in different settings, switching their lines, you see Tony's utter ease with Wong's method and you see Maggie's obvious discomfort (watch the Toronto Press Conference to hear a very guarded and careful statement by Maggie and then hear Wong Kar Wai say in the documentary that he and Maggie didn't hit it off from the get go for some hoots).
Pages of background by a noted historian puts the full story into the context of time and allows us to see why WKW set his story set pieces in particular years.  Posters, conceptual art, trailers, its all there...and in French too!  And check out the Russian one-sheet under promo materials to see a look that is totally different from those of America and Asia and Europe...
And the beautifully illustrated booklet with a short story that was a source for the film is another added bonus...

Instead, watching this movie made me feel like I was perhaps missing something all the Cannes and Toronto film award critics saw.  The movie never really captured me nor did it make me sympathize with the characters.  It was one of those ""artsy"" movies that leave critics in awe but moviegoers in disbelief...disbelief that we actually spent $$ and time watching this film.  It sets out trying to lure you into it's ""coolness"": insinuating scenes of raindrops badgering broken down concrete buildings, softly vivid colors that defined the 60's, characters walking slowly in tune with slow romantic music, etc.  But that's just it, I felt the movie tried so hard to be ""artistic"" that it never gave us a chance to feel what the characters might be feeling.  The music was highly repetitive; trying to soak you in it's intended ambiance but I guarantee you would want to turn down the volume after you hear the movie's theme score for the pointless Xth time.  The story was convincing: two neighbors each find out that their corresponding spouses are having an affair with each other.  Imagine the feelings of guilt, denial, anger and curiousity you would have finding this out about your husband/wife.

1328731,5,B00003CXUM,"If you were to find a fault in Wong's film it would be the pace: slow, methodical, but inspite and because of that pace ""In the Mood for Love"" is an utterly engrossing tale; a tale of a man who suspects his wife of cheating and a women who suspects her husband of the same. As they secretly share their pains and suspiscions they fall in love, a love which, due to guilt and the society they live in, cannot blossom.
""In the Mood for Love"" is a period piece, taking place in 1962 Hong Kong, and it captures the period wonderfully with small details like the snippets of Shanghainese speech and Nat King Cole's melodic voice floating in an American-style diner.
In this movie Wong Kar-Wai achieved brilliance on every level. Not only does he create a perfect mood with his methodical pace, dark yet beautiful camera work, but he tops it off with excellent performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung and an enthralling soundtrack that ties it all together. I have been a fan of Wong Kar-wai for some time, but in all of his films I felt something was missing. Here he has captured it all.

7918562,4,B00003CXUM,"Set in Hong Kong, 1962, In the Mood for Love depicts a pair of quiet, introverted neighbors who discover that their spouses have been carrying on an extramarital affair. As a means of coping with this mutual heartbreak, they begin spending time together - bonding over martial arts serials and a mutual curiosity about their significant others' double lives - and are shocked to uncover the flicker of a budding romance themselves. Their sense of honor, propriety and, perhaps, a jolt of fear stands in the way, though, and the pair treads cautiously lest they commit the same sins that first brought them together. That central conundrum proves impossible, ultimately, and it's an issue the film never completely resolves despite toying with the subject for quite a while. Which, in a way, is the most relatably authentic path it could've chosen. Sometimes life is defined by what happens between those narrowly-missed connections, those epic romances that could've been but weren't. Actually reaching that conclusion is somewhat laborious, as director Wong Kar-Wai dallies about with only faint plot developments for most of the duration, but I didn't mind that so much. The marvelous cinematography, rich supporting cast and lush, detail-laden scenery provides interest where the story itself might otherwise fall short.",1508457600,,1323,5.304761904761905
7918563,4,B00003CXUM,"The course of true love never did run smooth.
But must love perish?

The strikingly beautiful and original pathos of this movie certainly merits 4-stars, but there is also a bitter resignation that leaves me dissatisfied. Where is the anger? Where are the consequences of loss? The story walks the thin line between emotional restraint and chaos, all the way to its conclusion. There is no hint that chaos ever gets the upper hand, ever wreaks havoc.

Love denied is too often seen as a matter of chance and fate. But unlike a film like ""Roman Holiday"", where the impossibility of love is practically written into the stars, this movie offers the most pedestrian of obstacles--and even when that impediment disappears, love stumbles and fails.

Life is like that, we are quick to say. But the power of this film, it's universal language of longing and grief, really makes us wonder if all the cultural and (yes) political obstacles to love are so fixed and intractable. Love is the rule of life, and yet we do practically nothing to nurture, encourage or support love. Instead, love clashes with money, moralism and religious notions of sacrifice (Latin: ""production of the sacred""), and loses over and over and over.

Unfortunately, this film does nothing to challenge the mythology of fate that continues to defeat love in our lives.",1501977600,,1335,4.893805309734513

When I saw it shortly after its release, I would have rated it 5 stars, but on second viewing I found many flaws.  In the first 20 minutes nothing happens--that's when my wife fell asleep and I started yawning.  Then the story, what little of it there is, begins with friends Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan in Hong Kong accidentally discovering their spouses are having an affair together.  The action is so slow that this 1 hour 37 minutes film feels interminable.  Very gradually the friends fall in love, but vow never to consummate their relationship.  A key scene in the middle of the film concerning a mistress is SO confusing that my hypothesis was that the subtitles were mistranslated, because the dialog shifted back and forth and back between first person and third person and first person, which was subsequently explained as a role-playing rehearsal.  How frustrating!  That should have been explained BEFORE the scene.  Mr. Chow moves away and he's frantically searching for something missing from his apartment--but we're never told what was missing.  Immediately thereafter he finds a cigarette with lipstick on it, and the film never explains its significance.  About the only acting involved is lighting cigarettes and smoking, which was so common in films from the 1930s-1950s that it became a visual clich.  The two predominant musical themes on the soundtrack are pretty, but they're run into the ground by excessive repetition.  The scenes of DeGaulle visiting Cambodia and views of Cambodian architecture are irrelevant to the movie.

7918565,4,B00003CXUM,"One of my favorite films in recent years was The Grandmaster from 2013 which was written and directed by Kar-Wai Wong.  I decided to go back and look at this earlier film made in 2000, just a few years after England turned Hong Kong over to the Chinese.  Set in 1962, Hong Kong looks much different than it does today, something Wong seemed to want to focus on.  The city he grew up in.

Certainly the cultural differences are stark.  It would seem that empty nesters would rent out bedrooms in their smallish apartments just to make ends meet.  In this building, married couples are recruited.  On the same day, two couples are moving in at the same time, in apartments next to each other.  Wong only shows the faces of Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) whose husband is always away on business, usually in Japan.  Likewise we only get to see Mr. Chow (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung).  Similarly his wife is always working late, so not seen on screen.

Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow pass regularly in the hallway, occasionally see each other on the street but rarely speak beyond brief salutations.  Eventually they do and open up a bit about their respective absent spouses.  It becomes obvious to them, as it has to the viewer for some time, that their spouses are having affairs.  They talk about it, they practice confrontations and slowly become interested in each other.  We know it, they know it but they refuse to act upon their feelings, less they become like their spouses.  It is painful for them and frankly for the viewer which of course is the idea.

In one scene, they are forced to spend the night with each other in Mr. Chows room as his landlord is having an all-night card game in the next room.  The clandestine but chaste affair must be kept secret.  The kicker here as the PG rating would suggest is that the couple never act on their burning desires.  I don't think they ever even take off their shoes.  Still the romance is palatable.  However, the story moves along ponderously slow.

Wong shoots the film with interesting angles.  In one such scene the wannabe lovers sit in front of a make-up mirror, one with angled corners.  The camera pans so that we see the dour faces of each reflected back.  The soundtrack is very effective and includes several Nat King Cole love songs sung in Italian!  Realizing that their love for each other is doomed, Mr. Chow eventually moves out to another building closer to his job as a cartoonist.  The room number is 2046, which is also the name of Wongs 2004 film.  One which I didn't like much when I saw it many years ago.  Perhaps I should go back and watch it again.  I could be wrong.",1496275200,2,2628,4.4926004228329806
7918566,5,B00003CXUM,"Set in early 1960s Hong Kong, Wong Kai-wai's 2000 film IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE chronicles a brief affair, and one that is poignantly ambiguous.

As the film opens, we see two married couples move into rented rooms in the house of an elderly matriarch (living space is at a premium in Hong Kong, and the claustrophobic sets reflect the reality). Two of these new neighbours strike up a friendship because they feel similarly neglected by their spouses. The husband of Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), a traveling businessman, is often away for weeks at a time and probably seeing another woman. Meanwhile, newspaper reporter Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) quietly suffers his wife's betrayal as she stays out night after night with some other man.

Chan and Chow begin spending time together, wondering if their actions mirror those of their unfaithful spouses: ""Is this how it started?"" Their exact relationship remains ambiguous, as Chan suggests that any physical intimacy would be stooping to the level of their spouses. Even if their friendship is platonic, they struggle to keep it hidden from the conservative society of the time, adding considerable suspense to the film.

Tales of adultery are pretty old hat in art cinema, but the storytelling here is fresh and IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE proved a moving experience for this reviewer and his wife. Cheung and Leung play their parts with such painfully sad faces, as if the betrayal of a husband or wife is a natural disaster that can only be born quietly with dignity, never undone. It's not unbearably oppressive, however, and a little bit of comic relief is provided by Mr. Chow's coworker Ah Ping, played by Ping Lam Siu. Strikingly, Ping Lam Siu wasn't a professional actor at all, but rather a prop man, but he's a real character and I'm glad Wong Kar-Wai  brought him in front of the camera.

Besides the memorable acting, another strong point of this film is its exploitation of the medium. The viewer is dazzled by cinematic slight of hand such as a rapid succession of near-identical shots in the same location, representing in an instant how these characters had been meeting over weeks or months. Shots from under a bed or behind a curtain make the audience feel like a voyeur; we are no longer innocent spectators but almost implicated in the protagonists' affair that they are desperate to keep secret. The husband of Mr. Chan is never directly shown, while the face of Mr. Chow's wife is always turned away from the camera, an effect that strengthens the viewer's identification with these protagonists and leads us to sympathize with their feelings of neglect.

Criterion has released this film in both DVD and Bluray, but I strongly urge you to get the latter format, as the visual splendour of this film deserves viewing in high definition. The extras differ somewhat between the DVD and Bluray releases, but both contain a great deal of footage that was cut from the film. Knowing how the film was made will definitely elevate film editing in your eyes to the same level as the initial writing of any script -- which Wong Kar-Wai doesn't even do, working intuitively without a script. The director shot something like 30 times the amount of footage that finally made it into the film, including further directions for the story to go in (like a final meeting between the lovers, scenes of their spouses, etc.). He then pared all that down into the utterly convincing two hours that was ultimately showed to the world, in a process much like a sculptor revealing a masterpiece out of a huge block of marble.",1491955200,,3559,4.797716150081566
