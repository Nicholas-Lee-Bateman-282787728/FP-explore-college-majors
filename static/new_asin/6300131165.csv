7803822,2,6300131165,"To cover up for a story that was uninteresting, the producer and director knew that they must do something to save such a bad script. They did!! They filmed some of the best and fastest fight scenes in the Ocean Shore Catalog.
The story seemed to be about a man who was on the run and who was always being hunted down for no apparent reason. Villian after villian is hired to kill this guy but there is no way for them to match his high skills as he defeats them easily. Enter in his master who only begins to teach him kung fu after he has already  beaten several other men. (made no sense...it never seemed that he needed to be taught when he already appeared to be very very good!!!) The master teaches him about the 18 weapons of kung fu...which he never really used.
Overall don't watch this movie for a plot or story..there is none.  Watch it for the great fight scenes!!! (4 stars for fights 2 stars for the plot)",984096000,2,920,4.251428571428572
7803823,4,6300131165,"This is a fight filled flic with some great styles brought together in a great film.  One man caught up in something greater then he ever believed is forced to fend off an onslaught of attackers and killers.  Before he finds out the reason he loses many family members, and is forced to fight back using his 18 secret styles.  Amazing.",980380800,,335,4.459016393442623
7803824,1,6300131165,"All I have to say is this is pitiful. Any two year martial artist can do the whole movie with some student friends. This is the kind of movie that makes you say "" this is the kind of stuff that people like back then  "", or who could have made this junk. The editing is terrible. You can  see that it was geared to an American audience that knew nothing of real  martial arts. I say spend a few dollars on this only, and I mean only if you  are around a bunch of ""frat"" friends and want to end a weekend  with the biggest laugh of the week. I assure you you won't be disappointed.",940118400,,579,3.9145299145299144
7803825,5,6300131165,"this movie is awesome. the other reviewer to this point has said it best, but let me add, if you are a true kung fu, scene splitting, super-sound effect loving, 14,000 intricate move loving person, you gotta have this  one...",929923200,2,225,4.625
7803826,5,6300131165,"This film's title would lead one to believe that the movie is full of great weapons-based fight scenes in true martial arts movie style.  Not quite.  Sure, there are some (excellent) weapon-fighting sequences early in  the movie, but they are short and have nothing really to do with the actual  ""plot"" of the movie.  But you know what?  It doesn't even  matter!  This movie is a classic because it doesn't care about the title,  the script, or even the acting!  All it cares about is kick-butt kung-fu  fight scenes.  All your favorite stereotypical martial arts types are here:  the main character who has people attacking him everywhere he goes for no  apparent reason, the young actor dressed as a venerable kung-fu master, the  two guys who always fight together against their opponents, and some of the  worst editing you'll ever see (Watch the main character's outfit get dirty  as he falls down and magically become clean again as he's getting up to  resume fighting.).  All that being said, you will also find some of the  absolute coolest fight scenes this side of Sonny Chiba's ""The Street  Fighter.""  I honestly can't recommend this movie highly enough.  It is  a prime example of the chop-sockey movie and will remind you why you love  them so much.",923011200,3,1262,4.785046728971962
