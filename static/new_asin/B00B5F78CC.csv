8562899,2,B00B5F78CC,Not what I was looking for. This is more on different  techniques you can try to develope early skills then teaching formation and how the kid should stage hia or herself for the hit or catch.,1487030400,,192,4.333333333333333
8562900,3,B00B5F78CC,"It is okay.  there are a bunch of good ideas mixed in.  It is hard work to keep t-ball aged kids paying attention.  I wish there was more focus on how they throw, turn sideways and not just winging it to a ring.  Even bumping their thigh before they throw to get arm movement instead of pushing.  Last note- spoiler alert:  Do not expect your t-ball aged kid to be as good as the kids in this video, they are older kids performing t-ball drills.  It is okay as long as you are aware of your expectations.  I rented this from my library.",1460160000,,536,4.135922330097087
