8147253,5,B000IQBR9E,"A typical Shyam Benegal movie. Without being excessively maudlin or histrionic, the movie captures the trauma of a family torn by partition. Also very sensitively shows how the little kid experiences class bias from his classmates. Farida Jalal is at her best- very loving and very jolly though life has given her a raw deal.",1249776000,2,325,4.927272727272728
8147254,5,B000IQBR9E,"A touching story told very beautifully. It is a typical Shyam Benegal movie, that seems to have a soul.
The story captures the horrors of India-Pakistan partition very subtlety and brings to light the plight of  the divided families that still suffer in its bloody wake. The protagonist, Mammo, is played by Farida Jalal and she gives one of the most heart rendering performance here. The theme song of this movie sung by Jagjit Singh is very melodious.",1177804800,3,453,4.8076923076923075
