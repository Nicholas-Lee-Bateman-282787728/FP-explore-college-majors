2957094,5,B000VWYUFS,"An absolutely mesmerizing account of a chapter in American history. This should be required veiwing for all high school students, adults that know nothing about the Black experience, and adults that think they know everything about the Black experience. This video is not harmful to children or anyones ideology. It does challenge what people believe to be truth. If people can accept the truth from those that actually lived it, it will go a long way towards healing the wounds of the past. Being a upper middle aged white guy, I found the video simply reinforced what I believed to be correct. I recommend this video for the entire nation.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emancipation-Revelation-Revolution/dp/B000VWYUFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emancipation Revelation/Revolution</a>",1229212800,6,825,6.245614035087719

I am ordering a final version for myself and a SECOND one to donate to our local public library.

PLEASE...consider buying one for yourself and a SECOND one to give to  your own local library.  The public NEEDS to see it!",1223424000,6,370,4.382352941176471
2957096,5,B000VWYUFS,"This DVD is an award-winning documentary about the history of the civil rights movement in America and the role that both major political parties have played in it. Between, the title of the film and the topic that it discusses my first impression was that the film must be boring. It's NOT Boring! The documentary is so informative and enlightens the viewer so much, that it is a film I wish would be shown in all schools in America. I have personally watched it several times and have shown it to many of my friends. It is well worth the money spent for a copy of this DVD, and there is a need for more accurate informative films such as this documentary. Also, checkout this interesting website and what they say: [...] Then compare the DVD and the website. Money well spent!",1206489600,9,778,4.485915492957746

8220401,4,B000VWYUFS,This DvD was right on the money. The only reason I gave it four stars is that the home screen menu is off a little.,1356480000,,115,3.64
8220402,5,B000VWYUFS,"I did some research after watching this film. It is a true account of past history. A must see! I did research the 1854 Kansas Nebraska act,..the 1854 A'bolishment of slavery, the 1850 Fugitive Law,..then I researched the ""slave-ocrats""..and it is all true! I also researched the 1870 voting of the 15th Amendment and every Republican did vote against slavery,..while only 19 Democrats voted to end it. The history shows how the Democrats fought tooth and nail to keep slavery, while it was the Republicans that voted to stop it. I also researched and it WAS the Democrats that tried to keep children (black) from going to school, and also started the KKK! The big question now, is why do they always say it was the Republicans? They know they are not being honest!!The democrats ought to be ashamed!
Every school should show this film...but I nave a feeling that is the last thing they will do,..this is why private schools are so packed.",1331424000,8,939,4.7317073170731705
8220403,5,B000VWYUFS,"This video reveals how the main stream media has the majority of citizens believing the lie, that the Democrats are for the working man. Many Americans and especially my fellow African American citizens are convinced of this lie. This video presents facts and not opinions on what the Democrats really stand for. A must see for revelation",1329868800,4,338,4.947368421052632
8220404,1,B000VWYUFS,"Wish I could give it no stars!!!  This film is total proof that todays Republican party is totally out of touch with America's community of color!  After I finished laughing at the reenactment of Fredrick Douglass, I began to count the amount of times the word plantation was used!  Propaganda rule #1: if you say something enough people will believe you!  Everyone involved in this picture should be ashamed of themselves.  A feeble attempt of todays republicans trying to take credit for plight of the abolitionist during the Civil War.  A republican party who by no means would support a social program like the Freedman's Bureau today, and who only want to visit the NAACP to tell them to trade their food stamps for jobs!  Buyers beware...this is an insult of your intelligence!",1327017600,,783,4.842105263157895
8220405,5,B000VWYUFS,Every High school student in America should view this DVD and learn the truth of why our government wants to keep people on the 'plantation' and the price that is being paid for such scandlizm.,1304467200,5,193,4.542857142857143
8220406,1,B000VWYUFS,"This is not ""Eyes on the Prize."" The film presents earnest Black American Conservative voices making the case that today's Democratic Party represents the interest of modern plantations, and that today's Republican Party is the same as Lincoln's. The film fails to point out that the Republican Party of today, especially in the South is in fact the heir of the Dixiecrat opponents of civil rights legislation in the 1960's. The current ""liberal"" welfare state is identified as the plantation. Head Start, food stamps, housing assistance, Aid to Families of Dependent Children, Medicaid, school lunch programs, day care assistance to working moms, etc., are all intended to keep the colored folk dependent on the ""liberal"" master. ""Be free"", the film exhorts, ""Vote Republican."" Although there are a lot of facts of history thrown around, the context is clearly selected to the Right. The film is provocative, but I would not characterize it as instructive. Let the buyer beware.",1275868800,,979,5.2025316455696204
