8349027,4,B0021FP34U,"Previous reviewers panned this book but I actually enjoyed it.  There were tidbits like Heath's favorite wine that I found interesting.  Now, as to its accuracy, who knows whether the info is true or not.  I choose to believe it as it is the closest I will ever get to knowing what Heath was like.  I would love to read an authorized biography of his life but I doubt that will ever happen as everyone close to him is respecting his wish for privacy.  It is wrong of me to want to invade that privacy but I can't seem to help myself when it comes to this amazing actor.",1247270400,6,569,4.18348623853211
