7990702,5,B00009B8CQ,"This series is full of short episodes that are fully packed with humor in the 'Oh! My Goddess'/'Ah! Megami-Sama' vein. These are the video equivalent of the vertical single-strip fillers that appeared in the original monthly mangas - direct, concise and packed with pint-sized ROF laughter!

Mainly centered on the goddesses Urd And Skuld - along with a surprisingly lucid house rat named Gan, - these episodes alternatively poke fun at movies, sports, techology, magic and various other subjects at random. They're almost all light-hearted, with the sole exception being an episode titled ""Rainy Day""; this one is a gentle musical episode that will make you smile wistfuly as it plays. The others? You'll chuckle, laugh and end up straining something when you catch the references that usually are blantantly obvious - such as a certain 'monster-ous' film studio logo, twisted to fit this series.

With times like they are,  this is something to have on the shelf for when you need a little lightening-up...",1290384000,,1008,5.096969696969697
7990703,5,B00009B8CQ,"I love this spin-off series of the Ah! My Goddess series.  I just think it's hilarious to see the antics that Urd and Skuld often get to and the pain and endurance Gan-Chan has to go through.  Heck, you don't necessarily have to be a fan of the franchise to enjoy it, take it from me.",1235779200,2,284,4.053571428571429
7990704,3,B00009B8CQ,"The Adventures of Mini-Goddess (in the handy petite size) is a collection of vignettes which show the daily antics of super-deformed Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld. The way I understand it, the events in this anime take place in the premises of the original OAV. It's like what the goddeses do in their spare time, when they aren't preoccupied with humans.

Most of the eps feature Urd and Skuld, and a rat friend / sidekick they affectionately refer to as Gan-chan. Belldandy just comes and goes, I figure this is because she's always busy taking care of Keiichi and doing household chores in the OAV. Adventures of Mini-Goddess eps are very brief, lasting only about five minutes or so. What do they do in these eps? Just about everything -- from searching for treasure in the attic to making fun of Gan-chan. It's all very silly and shallow. The humor is generally weird, albeit at times admittedly funny. In the first ep, Urd poses as a fortune teller and tries to help Gan-chan with his lovelife. After a series of Urd's erratic love spells, Gan-chan ends up getting married to a tea kettle.

The art and animation are quite good but cutesy in style, as this anime's theme seems to revolve around cuteness. You can actually watch this without previous Oh My Goddess background because the eps pretty much stand on their own. The songs and music are also pleasant and catchy, following the tradition of the original. To be honest, I'm quite neutral in my feelings about Adventures of Mini-Goddess. I'm not crazy about it but I don't dislike it either. Adventures of Mini-Goddess is simply a combination of brainless fun and a whole lot of cute stuff. If too much cuteness makes you cringe however, you may want to skip this altogether.",1158796800,4,1734,4.7194719471947195
7990705,5,B00009B8CQ,"This short shorts make fun of everything, from monster movies, action & adventure flicks, space epics, dating games, trains, elections, baseball, treasure hunting and even have some touching moments, like the episode with Urd during a rainy day.
I knew Wendee Lee was the English voice of Urd, but then I realized Belldandy was being played by Belldandy..er..I mean Ruby Marlowe and Skuld was being played by Sherry Lynn, well, I couldn't be happier.  Toss in Tony Oliver as Keiichi, Anthony Mozdy playing Gan-chan (who seems to get all the best lines) and you have a perfect little series.  Something to enjoy on those slow days, when it is raining or when you just need a break.
Don't forget the green tea and rice crackers!",1109289600,2,726,4.8
