2960800,2,B000W0DE5Q,"I have purchased all the DVD's in this series and this 2008 edition is a big disappointment!! By far the best is 2007 which is sold out and now commanding high prices online. I much prefer B&W to color and also feel a stadium setting or abandoned buildings works best, even if it might be hard to create something different each year. Each edition has progressively shown more full frontal nudity and I was expectiong more this year but there is absolutely NO FULL FRONTAL NUDITY, a big mistake if the producers were expecting increasing sales. Also, many of the models look tired, bored, and uncomfortable...although seeing many of the hot models aging over the years of the series is interesting. Now the big question for me is whether I will buy the 2009 edition.",1211587200,6,766,4.681481481481481
2960801,4,B000W0DE5Q,"Dieux du Stade: Yes, the Gods of the Stadium are as handsome, and well-groomed as Pagan Gods.  Where would Pagan Gods fit best? This time the production chose a neoclassic villa, with a beautiful garden decorated with marble statues among others.

About the video: This time it was shot in colors. The producers and the troupe have increased considerably in number. The quality of the video is above average. The athletes and their bodies are extremely beautiful, and well-shaped/toned. Unfortunately, the make-up/maquillage procedures are too long, too elaborate, and somehow ridiculous. But all in all, the athletes have gorgeous body, and often also very handsome faces.

I must admit that one's own expectations before watching the video shape also the personal perceptions about its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the overall quality of this 2008 edition. You will see lots of beautiful things, but do not expect heavy loads of full frontal nudity. I simply haven't seen it, and I bet you won't either!

Post Scriptum:

I have received the DVD as a present for my birthday at the end of October 2007. Since I had received it from France (the first copy), it still was in a Pal color version. I have had not had problems watching it.

I believe that the distribution's delays in the NTSC version are mainly due to post-production and (maybe) marketing issues. Among the many ""Making of...."" - this is probably the least fortunate edition. On one hand it might be because the producers seem to be running out of ideas on how to find and then create (an) appropriate setting(s). On the other hand, it may also be due to long waits, and some scenes that are slow and boring. Since this edition has lost quite of its peculiar ""flair"" and thrill -- it is conceivable that the producers did chose not to invest additional money on a product that hasn't been that successful so far. The 2007's edition has reached its peak, and in my opinion it has been the best so far. It will be difficult to create a better one, unless in the next edition we will be blessed by watching also the new entries players (younger, more fresh, and extremely sexy).

By any means, some of the other videos (with similar topics) on the market are still inferior to this 2008 Dieux du Stade edition. The greatest flaw of this 2008's video is its slight artificial atmosphere, and a lack of veracity. There are too many useless people around the sets: More like friends of the troupe or visitors. Plus, since most of the shooting takes place in the garden, some of the rugby-players look annoyed by the long waits, and the wind chills. However, even if sometimes it is artificial and slow, the show is still decent and viewable. Buy it only if you have technology that allows you to watch also PAL system colors. Otherwise, use the media center on your computer.

8220914,4,B000W0DE5Q,"Dark, Romantic, Classical almost spiritual, Immaculate composition, Superb technique....this is one feast of the now infamous Franois Rousseau Galore.
While though Mr. Rousseau's work has already evolved onto the next level as we saw in his monumental conceptual work 'Atelier' (Maison europenne de la Photographie), this is definitely a re-omnibus of his influential photographic works from 2005 to 2008, namely 'Princes of the Sea', 'Amor Causa', 'ORA' all rolled into one stroboscopic explosions of imagery.
DEFINITELY STOCK THIS FOR YOUR PERMANENT COLLECTION IF U'RE A FRANOIS ROUSSEAU FAN AS I DO! ENJOY! ^0^

They just keep getting worse and worse as the years go by.  It has a stupid concept (a boat trip, mostly) and almost all the scenes have all the guys in one group instead of being alone or in small groups as in the good years.  And by the way, it is censored.  What a waste of money.",1356480000,28,418,3.8823529411764706
