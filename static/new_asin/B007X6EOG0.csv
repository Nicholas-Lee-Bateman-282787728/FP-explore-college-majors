8522820,4,B007X6EOG0,"This version is a remake of the original from Yam Kim Fai & Bak Suet Sin, both legendary opera stars,by their most successful students Loong Kim Sang and Mui Suet See. Their superb performance in this opera classic is as good as their masters' if not better!
This story is set on the backdrop of the last days of the Ming Dynasty, with the focus on Princess Chang Ping the eldest daughter of emperor Chong Zhen. When rebel forces entered the capital, the emperor ordered all his empresses and consorts to commit suicide rather than face capture and humiliation by the rebel troops. The emperor attempted to kill the princess before hanging himself. The princess survived and was saved by a Ming Minister who later attempted to present her to the new Manchu emperor who had ousted the rebel forces and established the Qing Dynasty by then. She escaped and went into hiding in a nunnery and later was reunited with her prince consort(played superbly by Loong Kim Sang).They utimately offered themselves as hostages to the Qing court in exchange for a proper burial for the deceased Ming emperor and the release of the former Ming Crown Prince, brother of Princess Chang Ping. After the Qing emperor fulfilled his promises, the princess and her prince consort were married in the palace. On the wedding night, the couple toasted each other with poisoned nuptial wine, a final act in defiance of the Qing dynasty and a sacrificial act of honour in respect of the late Ming emperor. This scene is performed in the last section of the movie and is the most important highlight of the opera. I simply couldn't get enough of this song performed with fully charged emotion and passion by  Loong & Mui! This story is essentially a work of political resistance and a dramatic means of declaring political allegiance, loyalty and filial piety to the last Ming dynasty.

I wished this movie came with English subtitles - it would have made it more comprehensible for someone like me who doesn't read Chinese! There are many areas where deeper poetic and metaphorical speak in classic Chinese is beyond my level of Cantonese comprehension. But what can I say - this movie is  such a treat for opera fans and Loong/Mui did such a fantastic job that one could be totally immersed into every scene with them, comprehensible Cantonese or not!",1348790400,,2324,4.776119402985074
