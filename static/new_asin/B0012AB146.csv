8244958,1,B0012AB146,"I rank this video ""very poor"" for the same reason as explained in my review of the ""Level 1-2"" video.

The only words really used by the instructor are ""rock back, 1, 2 3, 4"".  There is virtually no verbal instruction or explanation on the moves. The dance instructor expects you to learn simply by watching the moves. Most of the moves demonstrated in real speed look awkward, last only 2-3 seconds, and the music does not even sound like jive. These make the moves very hard to follow.

The only useful parts are the slow motions. This is why I gave it a credit of 1 star. But again, the slow motions also do not have verbal instruction or explanation.

I bought the ""Level 1-2"" and ""Level 3-4"" videos at the same time.  I wish I had only bought one video first, so I would have learned its' poor production and would not have bought the second video.  The ""Bonus materials"" takes up about 80% of the entire video and it really teaches nothing about jive.  It shows captions of other types of dance and serves only as an advertising scheme of their other videos.  The ""Bonus materials"" are identical between ""Level 1-2"" and ""Level 3-4"" videos; therefore, if you already made the mistake of buying one of the video, it makes very little sense to buy the second.",1207440000,2,1262,4.456521739130435
