In the course of the story Kim develops friendships with many different characters including a Bhuddist holy man (played by Peter O'Toole) and certain undercover figures connected with the British Secret Service. The plot of the story develops around a group of Russian military personnel who stake out the Himalaya region for an invasion of Russian forces into India. Operatives of the British Secret Service employing Kim as an undercover agent are successful in thwarting the aggression contemplated by the Russian military personnel. Kim is decorated as a hero of the British Secret Service. Kipling's story Kim is more detailed and intense to read then the screenplay, but the screenplay is engaging and well-acted and interesting to watch.",1340150400,,942,5.123376623376624
