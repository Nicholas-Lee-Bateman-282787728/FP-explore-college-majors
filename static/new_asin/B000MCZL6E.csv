8167886,5,B000MCZL6E,"I bought this film years ago, and I love it.  It clearly explains and renounces everything that the ""progressive"" liberals use to promote evolution.  After watching this, I had to laugh at how unintelligent this theory is.  Remember, evolution is a ""theory"" and it has never been proven to be the truth.",1411171200,,303,4.788461538461538
8167887,1,B000MCZL6E,"A friend gave me this tape years ago when he was cleaning out his desk.  All these years later I finally watched it.

This tape is geared towards the creationist minded people as it spins a secret plot to keep evolutionary theory taught to everybody.  It makes rather outlandish claims with linking evolution to communism, Hitler and abortion.  It mentions the well known hoax of the Piltdown man as a conspiracy by evolutionist to prove their claims.  Failing to mention it was science which exposed the hoax.

It makes claims of falsification of data.  For example John Morris makes the claim Lucy bipedalism was based on a hip and knee bone which is contested by many paleoanthropologists.  The problem is this is not true.

A common theme seems to center around absolutes.  Unless the explanation is absolutely right, it's dismissible.  Be it dating methods, be it the evolutionary process.

Speaking of dating methods, there is a specious claim labs date things by orders of scientists.

Darwin was of course mentioned and there described him as throwing away his Religion which in fact the man struggled with his findings which he took a long time and only was really motivated to publish when he thought Wallace was about to do the same.

New age mysticism is raised and the claim is made evolution is trying to replace God with Man.

Dover is mentioned and of course the claims of censorship to silence Creationism with the help of the ACLU.

Overall, it's dated.  Many of the claims are out right wrong and or are no longer being made.",1308441600,,1544,4.7443609022556394
