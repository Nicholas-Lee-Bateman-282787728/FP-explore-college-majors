8234963,3,B000Z7G8AO,"This DVD is extremely uneven in its coverage of the parks listed in the description.  Yellowstone, for example, shows Old Faithful, briefly, then an extended treatment of the Yellowstone falls and the canyon--nothing about the other thermal features or the northern and western parts of the park.  In the Red Rocks part of the DVD, a lot of attention is paid to petroglyphs and Sedona.  The narration is pretty hokey, and the cinematography is adequate--nothing special.  The packaging and DVD credits carefully conceal the actual date of production, but, looking at the car models, the giant VHS camcorders, and the mustachioed interviewees, I would guess that this was shot in the early 80s, NOT 2008!",1346630400,,703,5.086956521739131
