1910102,5,B0000C2IV1,"The first workout I have ever enjoyed in my life. Combines sports and dancing, in a fun, strength-building, confidence-boosting way.

 The three ladies have REAL bodies. Real strength and beautiful definition, without being thin. Having strong legs and hips is an asset while following this video. The moves come easy to someone who has always done sports in the past, but now has limited options available.

 This video is so entertaining. Listening to the pleasant voice and encouragement of the instructor, watching the girls with my own aspirations, and the beautiful videography, are just some of the elements that make this video WORK.

 I pop  this tape in 4 to 5 days a week, and am 40+ years old. So fast, it became an excellent workout I can do, while thinking  through whatever is on my mind, or chosing to focus on the dance.",1097625600,13,837,4.763888888888889
1910103,4,B0000C2IV1,"I really enjoyed this workout and I think it will be fun and challenging and not get boring for a while.  But I do have one complaint and that is that I don't think the instructor takes enough time to isolate and demonstrate the moves.  If I hadn't already been used to my bellydance workout dvds (and they are good at the demonstration) I would have been lost, discouraged, and frustrated.  As it was, I was only slightly frustrated and I hope to get better at it soon.",1093478400,7,470,4.318181818181818
1910104,5,B0000C2IV1,"I'm all for letting out my inner goddess as long as she burns some calories for me. Let's face it, working out can get boring if you are doing the same aerobic moves all the time. By incorporating dance routines from various countries, you can enhance your workouts and also enjoy a mini-vacation.

Kili guides you through the Hula dance moves that seem to be as ancient as time itself. I found myself almost transported back in time while trying this unique island tradition. Kili has been dancing for 25 years and she shows a Hula dance, teaches you the dance and then repeats the dance so you can really learn the moves. By the third time, I was actually doing the dance and it is so much more fun than boring old aerobics moves. Kili's cueing is perfect and her voice is very pleasant.

In this DVD you will find instruction for 7 basic dance moves:

Kahola
Hela
Double Hela
Kawelu
Ku'i
Ka'o
'ami

The beach patrol clothing is a highlight of this workout. The dancers wear orange skirts, striped shorts, bikini tops and even red orchids attached to their outfits. They are dancing on a woven mat set on the greenest grass you can imagine. The entire scene with a sapphire blue sky and rippling ocean made me a bit heady. I definitely need to visit Hawaii. If you love flowers and lush scenery, not to mention bright sun and waves crashing on a beach, this is going to really take you away from the normal routine of your life.

So, after watching Kili show you the dance you will be learning, you learn all the basic moves and then suddenly you find yourself really doing the hula. Not only will you tone your entire body, you will notice almost immediate results. Your abs will be tightened and toned. The very easy lunges in this workout did not hurt my knees and were perfect for toning and firming. Toning your stomach by dancing is way more fun than sit-ups.

Kili has cute ways of explaining the moves: ""Like the Motion of the Ocean."" I love her creative teaching style and I'm very excited about trying all her workouts. The music is quite motivational and you can hardly sit still while listening to it. There is also a section where you can do the entire routine with just the music and no instruction.

1910105,2,B0000C2IV1,"I am dumbfounded by how many positive reviews this DVD has. I think this workout is more suited for senior citizens. While the instructor is clearly in fantastic shape and knows about hula dancing, this has (at the most) one third of the content and moves found in a typical workout DVD. Also, there is horrible editing in several spots where the camera stays zoomed in on just the stomach or upper body of one of the women when what you need to see is their feet and legs. The instructor will be verbally describing a new move, or changing something, with your legs or feet, and all you see is a close up of the upper body that comes across as creepy and a little perverted.
Aside from that, the ""workout"" is one short dance routine that they a really long time to get to the point of running through the whole thing. The moves require you to contract your abs if you are doing them correctly, but there is very little challenging your buns here. And you have to be incredibly out of shape to really break a sweat going through this whole DVD. Its a shame, because if the hula moves were utilized better, and there was more variety, more drilling, a much longer and better structured routine (or at least 3 different ones which is standard in most workout DVDs) this could have been a great DVD.
I can't justify anyone paying more than a dollar for this.",1466380800,5,1355,4.380952380952381
1910106,5,B0000C2IV1,"I bought this program just over four months ago. Just like so many other exercisers, I too was embarking on trying to get back into shape after the Holidays. So I went in search of some programs to help me with my journey. I had known about ""kili's Programs"" for awhile. I had had a ""HULA WORKOUT PROGRAM"" years ago, but I don't remember much about the program, except that it was on ""VHS"". And I don't remember if it was ""Kili's Program"". My interest in ""Hula"" began when I was about eight or nine years old, and we had a ""Luau"" at school. My interest waned a bit until I got involved with BELLY DANCING"". Unfortunately I had no way to further or advance my lessons. So once again my interest went on the back burner, until ""Video's"" became available. Then in ""1992"" I discovered a ""BELLY DANCING PROGRAM"" on ""VHS"". Years later I came across the ""Hula Program"". HULA was/is not that difficult for me because it is very much like ""BELLY DANCING"". I don't remember how come I didn't continue with the ""HULA PROGRAM"". And by that time I had gotten away from ""BELLY DANCING"" because I had moved into other forms of exercise, such as ""Weights"" and ""Stepping"".

When I'm away from exercising for awhile I'll ease my way back in by ""Walking"" and/or ""Dancing"". I was in a Local Supermarket, in their ""Video Section"" when I saw a selection of ""Natural Journeys Fitness DVD's"". That lead me back to """"BELLY DANCING"" again. ""Veena and Neena"" were being offered and I bought them, eventually buying five of their ""BELLY DANCE FITNESS PROGRAMS and later their ""BELLY DANCE INSTRUCTIONS DVD'S"". There was another ""BELLY DANCING FOR WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, too, that I bought. I wanted to try ""HULA"" again. So I was on ""AMAZON"" which is my favorite website, looking for some sort of program. I then came upon ""KILI'S PROGRAMS"". I immediately put this program into my cart but I did not purchase it. I was very excited, too, because it was affordable. Still, for some reason, I kept saving it, instead of purchasing it. Then I got myself into some trouble. I got lazy in the Exercise Department. And gorging during the Holidays really put me in a pickle. After putting about four inches on my waist and about five more on my behind, I knew I had to get busy. Plus I want to look my best for ""MY WEDDING"", which is coming up later this year. According to my calculations, I have roughly six months and ten days to get nyself into better shape.

Finally, I decided to order this program along with several others. My idea is to rotate them about every six weeks or so. I really do enjoy this one and it isn't hard to learn. ""KILI"" AND HER FRIENDS first demonstrate the ""HULA DANCE"" then they break it down into manageable parts. Then it is put together in the ""Dance"" that was demonstrated at the beginning. It's not to difficult. Though to be fair I have practiced ""BELLY DANCING"" which is why I find it simple. I am still learning the steps, though. I want to comment on the lady who said a ""Dance Background"" is needed. I DISAGREE. It makes no difference what a person does, that person has to get started somewhere. All it takes is a little practice. And so what if some of the steps are done wrong. You are still exercising your body and eventually you will get the steps correctly. And even if you don't, you'll have fun while you work at it. This workout was filmed on a beautiful beach in Hawaii. It is time friendly: thirty minutes, from the warm up to the cool down. There is a lot of leg work, as the tummy is to be held in, while engaging the arms. I had/have to consciously hold my arms straight because I have a tendency to slack them.  Also the knees are bent quite a bit. So if you have problems in that area bend gently. Everything does not have to be done exactly. You will still get the same  benefits. Someone mentioned that the movements were fast. I don't find them to be fast. As I said, though, I am still learning the program. Having only done it twice, at this time, would hardly qualify me as an expert at ""HULA DANCING"". LOL! I intend to buy ""KILI'S"" other Programs. I like her. She isn't a ""CHATTY CATHY"". No offense to anyone. Though there was a ""Doll"" by that name. LOL! I most likely will rotate this program with others of ""KILI'S PROGRAMS"". Or use it with other shorter ones. I'm considering using this with one of ""THE FIRM"" PROGRAMS that I have. I haven't decided. I've got ""ZUUMBA"", ""BELLY DANCING"", ""BALLROOM DANCING"", ""SALSA"",  ""CARDIO"", ""WALKING"", AND ""WEIGHTS"". That's more than enough to rotate with. But if I only have a half of an hour, I'll be reaching for this program. BUY THIS PROGRAM. IT IS WORTH THE $FIVE DOLLARS.",1466294400,,4644,4.446009389671362
1910107,5,B0000C2IV1,"I had this workout before and loved it, but misplaced it.  Now I am falling in love with it all over again.  The way Kili teaches walks you through things slowly at first, hooking them together, until you are able to do the entire routine.",1465862400,,239,4.288888888888889

1910114,5,B0000C2IV1,"I thought this was going to be an easy work out. I was thinking, how can Hula dancing be challenging? but I thought this will be something to do on the days when I don't want to do a complete work out but just get a little fun movement or stretching in. Well I got that and more. This is a fun, challenging way to stretch and tone your body while learning hula moves. I really enjoy it.",1458864000,,386,3.9615384615384617
1910115,5,B0000C2IV1,"This is fun & really good workout.  Not only does it work the abs & buns, you hold your arms up for much of the workout to feel them burn too.  This is my favorite workout by Kili that I've done so far.",1458777600,,202,3.6744186046511627

Nice warm up, and the work out is much more than you even realize you are doing.  Has a great cool down.  Nice for beginners and even those overweight can do this workout.

1910140,4,B0000C2IV1,"Allow me to preface with this: I grew up in Hawai'i and was a hula dancer from the day my mom shoved me in a class at the age of 5 until I rebelled at 13. =)  Of course, when I wanted to go back, is when we moved to California and there wasn't a nearby halau.  =(  Anyways...I purchased this dvd as something new and fun to add to my workout regimen, and I like it.  It is however, definitely for beginners, of both exercise and hula.  I've decided to use it as a warmup before I do my Iron Core Kettle Boot Camp workout or on a day I just want to do 20 min of something easy and light.  It does get me warm and a little sweaty so I am gaining benefit from it, and I do feel a small burn in my quads.  However, the ""abs"" part of this workout is questionable.  I understand that the instructor is trying to incorporate an abdominal flexion but it's of such short duration and limited intensity that I doubt I'm seeing any real benefit there.  That's okay, though, I have Jillian Michaels Killer Abs dvd for that, and she kills me!

Overall, it's fun and I'm glad I bought it, especially since it was under $5.  But it's not enough as a stand-alone workout for me.  The music and queuing are appropriate, although there isn't much in the way of modifications.  The background, of course, is beautiful, even the dog who wanders through at one point is cute.",1440288000,,1354,4.161538461538462

1910147,2,B0000C2IV1,"If you're coordinated and pick up moves fast, then this is a great video.  If not, then you probably want to pass.  I did break a sweat, but I looked ridiculous doing it and had some difficulty with combining all the movements into the final dance at the end.  I feel fairly confident that if I did hula for twenty five years, like Kili, (and surfed, and ran on the beach, and had naturally beautiful bone and muscle structure) then I would look amazing like her.  However, I am not confident that, even if I did this DVD religiously, I will have the same results.

They're very toned and the moves are seductive and good for the gals. I love the hip and lower leg movement, because it seems like women should use their hips like this more...it's really feminine, natural and alluring.

The moves are slow and low, and it might take a few tries to get the steps and the rhythm down. If not done right, it can hurt (squats and the like). I actually thought the cool down at the end was pretty intense the first few times I did it.

Anyhow, a good switch-up from other DVDs that I use.",1422403200,3,549,4.310679611650485

1910180,5,B0000C2IV1,"This review is not so much for the hula sequence, but for the dog featured about 2/3 of the way through. The director really knows how to motivate and inspire with this jaunty little fellow. Our delightful cocker spaniel friend comes along just when you feel like you might not make it through the routine and inspires you to carry on. The dog may not dance as well as the others, but he sure hula'ed his way into my heart.",1398384000,,423,4.3
1910181,5,B0000C2IV1,"Good deal.  My wife and her sister found them challenging and enjoyed the pace.  It does not seem hard, but it is all about control.  Its good to get out of the normal workouts with the same moves on every video.",1393891200,,212,4.121951219512195

1910184,4,B0000C2IV1,"I received this DVD from Amazon (quick, as always) yesterday and gave it a shot. First off, I'd like to say I am in love with the setting. It's very cold where I live right now, and the beautiful island scenery will really warm you up. Kili and her dancers are great and pleasant. The dvd will first show you the dance you will learn, which seems rather complex at first, but as you learn it, it gets easier. Then, you will do a nice warm up. After the warm up, Kili will walk you through the work out and you will learn 7 types of hula moves that will ultimately combine to create the dance. Then, you will do the dance with Kili's instructions, then you will do it without her instructions twice. I have to say this is the most fun workout DVD I own, although it is not all that challenging. I am used to Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. Those videos will really kick your butt. I purchased Island Girl to mix it up, and that it did, although I will probably only do it once a week on days when I need a light work out.
Now, I did get out of breath once or twice, but nothing compared to Jillian's DVDs.
I say give this a shot for a fun, moderate workout.",1389139200,2,1182,4.07725321888412
1910185,4,B0000C2IV1,"This isn't the most challenging workout, but when I was having problems with pain in my hips, this was a good video to help loosen them up.  You won't break too much of a sweat when doing this, and it doesn't get your heart rate up very far, but if you want a low impact way to get your body moving, this is a good DVD for that.",1389139200,,328,3.823529411764706
1910186,2,B0000C2IV1,In my opinion you need to be able to have some dancing background to follow this program.  I was unable to do so after trying several times.  I admit I am not a good dancer at all but even so I wouldn't call this a workout program for a beginner.,1386547200,4,246,3.9

This one is different.  You don't really have to worry about the footwork in the beginning.  My 3 year old niece likes to do it too.  LOL",1386288000,,315,3.9838709677419355

It was a fun workout, I just wish they would show at least one of the dancers full body all the time so you could follow along easier.",1380153600,3,344,4.119402985074627

1910195,5,B0000C2IV1,"I've started back working out a month ago and wanted something a little different than what I was doing.  This workout is NOT a breeze.  Although 30 minutes, you are counting the minutes down.  Afterwards, you feel a sense of accomplishment.  Also, you won't find a more intense ARMS workout without weights!  I challenge you to make it through the entire video (including cool down) and keep your arms up like them the entire time!

PROS:
-Intense Workout for legs, arms, standing abs workout, hips
-Cute dog that wonders into the video during the workout
-Price
-Fun, sexy moves
-Different
-Actual traditional Hula music and moves
-Instructor gives your cues thoughout and breaks down moves to simplify
-At end you are doing hula without cues

CONS:
-We have to see the hips move up close, but please, crotch shots?

HINTS:
-Remember to keep your feet FLAT, not pointed and you'll pick up hula faster
-If you have bad knees, when able, push your knees together for pain relief",1372377600,2,978,4.779761904761905

This program is a nice mix of dance and exercises, but it's rather short--only 30 minutes (although that may be a plus for some people--easier to squeeze into your day!)  The bonus performance was nice.  I FAR preferred this to her ""Basic Hula"" DVD--although the Basic Hula DVD teaches you more of a dance routine, the music was just atrocious in that one (Hula rock?  ick!)  The more-traditional hula music on this one is impossible to resist dancing to--love those drums!  Give this one a try and dream of an island escape!",1367798400,,670,4.683760683760684

This video encouraged me to learn about Hulu dance and Hawaiian history and I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried it.  The workout starts with an introduction and you will learn the names of various dances and how they are performed.

1910209,5,B0000C2IV1,"I had my first baby 4 months ago and was looking for a good workout. I considered Zumba but heard it was very hard for beginners so I thought I would give an at home workout a try. I'm so glad I got this dvd. After 2 weeks of working out to it once a day, I lost 5 pounds and my pants are starting to feel baggy!

The key is to stick with it. Don't just try it once or twice and decide it's too hard or the moves aren't easy to follow. I had to watch it and do it like 5 times before I had everything down. Another tip is to really bend those knees. At first I didn't feel anything in my ab area but after I trained myself to bend my knees more, then I could feel it.

The music is really fun and perfect. The bass kicks in at just the right times. The wonderful thing about this workout and the music is that you don't feel like you're working out. You feel like you're dancing and the dance makes you feel so girly and sexy.

If you're debating whether to get this, just get it. It's affordable and you can workout on your own time and in private if you wish. I originally was just watching this video for free online but the dvd is so much better and I like to show my support to the people who made this dvd by buying it.

But I do like the instructor, music, and the background dancers - it is pleasant to look at.

It's easy to follow along with but you will feel it. For a low impact workout, it really makes you sweat. There is no jumping or moves that will stress your knees.

I read several reviews before ordering.  People who gave her a low rating do not understand hula or the training for it.  I found her moves to be beautiful hula moves and wish I could move as lovely.

DETAILS:
I DID NOT like this ""workout"" at all. The first 10 minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.
Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.

MY SYNOPSIS:
Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.
This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I'm sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless.",1315267200,11,689,4.0962962962962965

Kili, the instructor goes through each move more than once to make sure that you get it before moving on to the next one. This is a great video to do when you are short on time or prior to some more intense cardio/sculpting. Another plus, I'm plus-sized and some dancing videos include moves that are just beyond my fitness level...so I feel like I'm not getting the complete effects of the workout.

1910246,5,B0000C2IV1,"I'd been looking for something to get a bit more variety in my workout routine.  So I decided to give this one a try, since I rather enjoy watching hula dancing.  What a great purchase!

Kili has a great personality.  She is warm, engaging and keeps you going through the workout.  I really liked that she had two other girls in the video with her, rather than just her by herself.  It was really great for seeing a different angle to the dances and making sure you were doing it right.

The moves themselves were not that difficult.  I've done some basic belly dance fitness DVDs, so it was nice to have that foundation to dance through this.  Especially since hula, like belly dance, is a lot in the hips.  So even you know only a little and very basic, getting through the moves shouldn't be hard.  Kili always, always, gives vocal cues as to the next move, which is great because if you aren't paying attention (or watching where you're going) you know what to do.  She also gets major points for pointing out not to over-extend during a lunge movement, something that not a lot of at home DVD work outs will remind you of.  While this is meant to be a fun workout, it's also meant to be a SAFE workout.

This workout made me sweat, which felt great!  I was actually enjoying what I was doing, which is always a good thing.  There's no point in sweating and working out if you don't like it.  This is definitely a keeper and I may even pick up some of her other DVDs!  Yay for Kili!",1301875200,,1486,4.284172661870503

The cuing is okay, but it's a little irritating that the camera tends to focus on the performers upper body during transitions, so the first few times you might struggle to keep up with the leg work. That is one reason I'm only giving it 3 stars. The other is that it's very tough on your knees. I have scarred tissue around both of my knees, but I assumed that because I've been doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Ballet-Conditioning/dp/B000WC38BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Ballet Conditioning</a>&nbsp;for a while without issues that I wouldn't have a problem with this. Wrong. Even though this is about 30 minutes from start to finish I think the fact that you spend it all with slightly bent knees makes it really rough on those joints. Though I didn't have any pain during the exercise, about an hour later I had to ice both of my knees, and they're still really bothering me 12+ hours later. If you don't have knee problems this is a great DVD, but if you do, definitely treat it with caution.",1300665600,39,1241,5.0

The starting part she tells you what the dance looks like and then it goes right into the workout. I did not see where she trains you or teaches you the step by steps at all to each type of thing she did. Obviously, because the workout goes right into it, I had a terrible time keeping up as I did not know the steps. I think I would buy another video that gives you much more practice than this one though I could see how it would be a good workout if you knew what you were doing.",1298851200,,565,3.8793103448275863

This is a good workout for people like me who have not worked out in a while. However, I agree with another reviewer who said it can be a little hard on the knees. They incorporate squats into the movements which can make your knees sore. I think this is a good overall workout. It lasts about 30 minutes so it is very do-able.

You can pretend you are on vacation in Hawaii learning the Hula!  You don't realize how hard you are working until you start sweating - it really is an enjoyable workout without being frenetic.  There are some light yoga moves incorporated, but not annoyingly so.  You also use your arms a lot, which adds to the benefits.  I'm going to buy more of Kili's videos after mastering this one.

Its a great workout that you could do everyday and you feel the burn in your thighs with all the squats and squatting. The thing I like the most about it is that is not just your basic instructional dance dvd it incorprates your basic full body workout into the whole dvd while you are learning the dance which helps you accentuate the moves more and get better while doing them. You can definatelly feel your body working and toning up on these dvds. I would definately reccomend this dvd to someone who wants a low-impact workout or just a break from your normally stressful workouts and a really good workout for a beginner beacuse it will give you something to sweat and get better at.,1263254400,2,811,4.30718954248366

I thought that since the title says it's for beginners that it would be relatively slow moving and not too difficult.  Unfortunately, the instructor moves very quickly through each move as if just seeing her do it, you will automatically be able to do it.  Her phrase after showing you each movement ""This is how you do it and this is how it looks"" got on my nerves.  For a beginner's lesson, she certainly doesn't give you enough instruction or enough time to process the information and try to get it right.  Plus I was wrong about it being easier on my back since I would be standing and not lying down.  It hurt my back.  I didn't try using the DVD again
I then bought Rodney Yee's Abs Yoga for Beginners, and I love it. Very easy to follow, and I feel like I'm getting a good beginner workout.

The only part that caught my interest was the intro where they are actually DANCING.

Other than the beautiful background and the music ( if you can hear because the instructor talks so much)  there is nothing ""authentic"" about this workout.  Your basically doing the traditional workout of the same old lunges and squats only difference is you move your hips side to side.  Its a workout with music in the background not dancing.  Maybe it was just me but the people were so stiff and rigid not smooth and free flowing at all.  I mean it seemed fake to me like they were not enjoying the workout at all.

1910272,4,B0000C2IV1,"This DVD was my first experience with the Island Girl Dance Fitness series, taught by instructor Kili Kilihune.  Kili teaches the workout barefoot with two background exercisers against a gorgeous Hawaiian backdrop.  The music is mostly a strong drum beat throughout the approximately 32-minute workout.  The DVD is chaptered, breaking up the workout itself into the warm-up, dance instruction, dance, and cool-down.

Prior to the start of the workout, Kili and friends begin with a very brief dance demonstration.  The 4-minute warm-up begins slowly with hip swings, but Kili quickly brings these up to tempo.  Additional moves include side-to-side steps and standing obliques; the warm-up concludes with a standing glute stretch.

During the main portion of the workout, Kili introduces various hula steps, starting slow, then bringing them up to tempo.  The DVD case states that the workout ""combines traditional hula with modern fitness moves,"" and Kili does a nice job at making this combination appear seamless.  For example, one of the first steps she teaches is kaholo, what she says is the most important basic step in hula--sort of a hip sway while stepping from side-to-side.  To this move, she ups the intensity by adding level changes and knee lifts.  Similarly, after you learn another hula step, ka'o, which involves alternately lifting the heels, Kili adds a basic squat.  Some of the steps, such as hela (a sort of lunge) focus more on the glutes, where as others, such as 'ami (waist rotation) target the abs.

Once Kili has taught you seven basic hula steps, she leads you through the simple dance that she and the other two women demonstrated at the start of the workout.  The first time, Kili cues the various steps, but then the dance is repeated two more times without the cueing--I found this a bit tricky and would have preferred if she had cued throughout.  The workout concludes with an approximately 6-minute cool-down.  Here Kili again slows down the moves, performing gentle side stretches, hip rolls, side steps, and the same glute stretch that she did in the warm-up.

Overall, this is a nice little light cardio/light toning workout.  I was impressed that Kili provided very good, mirrored cueing and that workout did move quick enough to get my heart rate up a little at times.  If you are looking for intense cardio or sculpting, this DVD probably isn't for you, but if you want a lighter, easy-to-follow dance workout, this might fit the bill.",1247529600,15,2479,4.987834549878346

You can see the ocean and another Hawaiian island in the distance behind Kili, which is also pretty cool. I feel like I got a mini-break from being in a colder climate with the great view.

After only the first 2 workouts, I noticed my legs felt stronger as I carried laundry up and down the stairs.

I had gotten so bored with my treadmill, other exercise videos, and exercise ball (not to mention weights) that I was not even exercising at all anymore.  But I look forward to doing the hula as often as I can.  I love the way I am more flexible, and s-m-a-l-l-e-r.  Isn't that what we all want?

I have found out, though, that I am not a natural dancer.

I have no rhythm but since no one watches me doing this I can pretend.",1190764800,11,376,3.7721518987341773
1910286,5,B0000C2IV1,"This is great! I just followed the DVD and feel very happy and energized. The workout is good but not overly strenuous, the instructor explains the moves and guides through very gently, and overall, it is a very happy, positive experience. It has a good feeling to it.

Hula is a sacred art that has many meanings, so one could say we are a little misusing it just for a workout, however, this DVD is not about really dancing hula. It just teaches a few hula steps with some workout moves.

As a practicing healing / massage and bodywork practitioner, I suggest hula, belly dance, tai chi, qi gong, yoga and swimming to all my clients, because they relax yet strengthen the muscles and thus exercise the body in a balanced and FUN way. It is very important to have a flexible pelvis, that helps the spine and good posture. And, it is very important to have a FUN workout, in order to do it regularly....",1188777600,19,903,4.433734939759036
1910287,5,B0000C2IV1,"I think this is a great workout video for anyone seeking a low impact routine.  If you are interested in something fast and bouncy this is probably not the video for you.  It has an even pace and when you just watch it you may not think it is very strenuous but, you would be wrong!! My daughters and I were all sweating (a lot) when we got done. At first we even took a break in the middle!  You can really feel it in your thighs and abs.  After I do this dvd I even feel thinner because my stomach feels tighter. I highly recommend it.",1185235200,14,537,3.9906542056074765
1910288,5,B0000C2IV1,"I now own four of Kili's Island Girl DVDs and love them.  She gives you a very thorough workout, and the better you get, the more of a workout you're getting.  This one really makes me sweat, and seems to be more of a cardio than the Tahitian Cardio, although that routine is excellent too.

If you've never done hula or Tahitian dance before, this video is hard on your thighs, but is very enjoyable. After doing this, I definitely feel it in my buns, more so than my abs, but I always feel like I got a well-balanced workout.

Doing these Island Girl routines will help you lose weight and get in shape, just stick with it.  I've been doing them for a couple of months now and can see and feel the difference.  I've slimmed down and lost about 12 pounds. I feel much stronger and healthier, and even sexier - my hips are moving in ways I didn't think possible :)

I highly recommend this workout",1178928000,50,897,4.272189349112426
1910289,5,B0000C2IV1,"I have gotton two left feet on the dance floor but have wanted to learn some moves while exercising indoors on cold days.  I was encouraged to try Hula after reading the reviews.  I love the dance/workout, which is easy to follow, and do it when I cannot exercise outdoors.  The dance moves coordinated with some squats make the muscles and the body relax and sweat.  I am glad that I gave the Hula workout dvd a try.",1168300800,11,417,4.3076923076923075

1910291,4,B0000C2IV1,"I ordered this dvd for two reasons...one I need to lose some weight and have fond memories of my trips to Hawaii two because I thought it would be fun to do with my 7 yr daughter who loves the hula dance scene from Lilo and Stitch, loves to dance and we could do it together.  We love the dance and the music in it and I'm very happy I ordered and wish I would have thought of it sooner.",1152057600,18,387,3.8375

I loved her since her first DVDs ""Hula Workout"" though those used cutsy 60s music & added 60s american dance moves but still have a lot of authetic hula dancing.

These ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.

I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.

There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo.com",1151452800,113,998,4.589887640449438

1910294,5,B0000C2IV1,"I started out with the Hula-Abs & Buns because I had been looking for some sort of Hula instruction.  I enjoy working out at home to video tapes and found this a great combination.  The more you do the video the stronger you get!  It is fun and I find myself smiling during the workout!  I have since purchased the other Island Girl workout tapes, but found the Hula- Abs & Buns the most challenging so far!  Having the variety of tapes in this collection keeps your workouts from getting routine!",1106611200,8,497,4.417582417582418
