I love her soothing voice, flowing style, and postures that can easily be adapted for beginning or advanced yoga travelers. Although not normally one for meditation, I find the special guided mediation feature extremely relaxing - and have even used it to fall (deeply) asleep. I would also recommend this DVD for people living in places with limited space for yoga - the poses chosen and adapted for a hotel room would also be great for the living rooms of apartment and condo dwellers.",1197763200,2,573,4.683168316831683
8416332,5,B000GDH8QK,"This video has a morning practice, evening practice, meditation, sitting practice, and daily practice. The sitting meditation is great for airplane stress reduction and relaxation. It is similar to the international clip they show about halfway through trips. The daily practice is great. It gets the heart going but its not too tough. There are 3 or 4 moves I use a yoga strap for. I laugh every time I try them. I'm a beginner and can follow reasonable well. The morning and evening practice are great when you will not have time to do the full routine or for a morning energizer or evening relaxation before bed. This is a great practice DVD, travel or not. I have been using it as a part of my normal daily practices.",1184630400,2,721,4.553846153846154
