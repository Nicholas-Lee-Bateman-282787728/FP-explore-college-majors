3708590,2,B001N2MWGO,"Russell Crowe usually gives a movie his all and manages to pull it off.  He tried here but he single handedly could not save this film.  It has way too many characters for him to be able to dominate this movie (like a stage play) and cudgel everyone else into submission.  First big problem: this is based on a UK miniseries for tv.  I saw the UK series and it was excellent.  So this film tries to shoehorn an entire television series into a feature film length.  This was managed with TRAFFIC but not here.  Second big problem: the other major character is played by Ben Affleck.  Supposedly his character and Crowe's roomed together way back when in their salad days.  It must have been like ODD COUPLE'S Oscar (Crowe) and Felix (Affleck) judging by their personal hygiene habits in the movie.  I cannot picture these two as buddies in any circumstances.  Crowe is a journalist and Affleck is a politician.  Affleck's assistant is murdered and Crowe uncovers an affair between Affleck and the victim.  Affleck's career is now in great jeopardy and he is also a suspect.  We could care less since Affleck adds nothing to this movie other than smarminess. Crowe has a journalist sidekick, a female.  She is cute and ok but they do NOT become like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, an excellent, earlier journalism-murder movie.  No, romantic chemistry and sparkle are missing here. Worse, this is aiming to be like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and it doesn't even come close to achieving the suspense and taut energy and crystal clear plot line of that film.  I held in there and watched this film till the end, strictly for Crowe, and I wish I hadn't.  He was wasted here despite his efforts to save it. I can't recommend it.

3708592,5,B001N2MWGO,"Very intelligent film about corporate espionage & corruption. Definitely ahead of its time & presages the sleazy Trump era.

Russel Crowe is great as usual as a reporter at a struggling newspaper who stumbles on a massive crime. First rate production, excellent script, fine supporting cast. Well worth seeing.",1518307200,,310,5.326530612244898
3708593,5,B001N2MWGO,"Newspaper/political story and mystery starring Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck  . This film is a take over of the UK political/news story series that was excellent. I had feared the US version could not live up to the UK, but I was wrong. The acting, script and storyline are first rate. I first saw this when it came out in 2009, when Viola Davis played a pathologist, a small bit part. The film rings even more true today, and we can see how politics and news intersects.

A young woman commits suicide or was she murdered? That is the crux of the film, and all of the sidelines that interweave prove to be very enticing. The newsroom is supposed to be a take off of the Washington Post, but is called the Washington Globe. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is in the closing credits when we get to see how a newspaper is put together and delivered in modern times. I found it fascinating, even though I knew the process.

The acting is superb, Crowe, Affleck, Wright, McAdams and Helen Mirren. Heavy weights all, and their combination bring a film that resonates.

Maybe it was a movie that couldn't find its genre, was it about journalism? politics? Military contractors? The entire film seemed derivative of many other films, but was not done as well. ""Spotlight"" (which also had McAdams) was a great film about journalists following a story. ""Argo"" (which also had Affleck) was a very good political thriller. and Russel Crowe had made many compelling military films. Somehow this film ""State of Play"" misses on all cylinders - with all the actors.

I kept asking myself why do I care about this congressman or this girl?  I had very little feelings for his journalist ""friend"" (an old college roommate with no chemistry between the two) who was trying to solve the mystery.  Again, why?  And the new journalist who went from brand new to becoming the lead on the story...not realistic.  The last question is why is a congressman suing (?) a military company....I didn't get it.

The other problem I had is there is a lot of soft talk where I couldn't hear what they were saying even with volume turned all the way up, so I missed a lot.  If you are hard of hearing, don't rent it.",1490486400,4,793,4.413793103448276

3708854,4,B001N2MWGO,"While my wife & I remember thoroughly enjoying the original BBC production, we couldn't really remember the plot so we watched the American re-make with fresh eyes (in much the same manner as Edge of Darkness). Crowe is excellent as the shabby but tenacious & principled reporter and although Afleck's performance as the politician at the heart of the corruption is a little wooden, he looked the part and at least he wasn't mumbling too much this time so we didn't need the subtitles. I'm not sure that casting Helen Mirren as the newspaper editor was quite right; it was not a major role and the multiple expletives did not seem either necessary or natural. That being said, the plot is suitably convoluted and the film generally rolls along at a satisfying pace. There was, however, a bit of ""missing the bleedin' obvious"" in the early part of the investigation into Afleck's researcher's death which spoilt the plausibility and deadened the pace slightly.

Although I don't really approve of the current Hollywood penchant for remakes (it smacks of laziness and a lack of imagination), this film is a very creditable conspiracy thriller in its own right and the edgy conflict between old-school and modern journalistic ideals (represented by Crowe and McAdams respectively) is a nice original touch. It's definitely a film we'd re-watch and we're tempted to get the BBC original, if only for its superb cast.",1420934400,,1412,4.957805907172996

3708953,4,B001N2MWGO,"Some thrillers feature  police detectives or private eyes.  Others feature ""amateur"" detectives, like lawyers (""The Pelican Brief"") or journalists, and this one features journalists.  The Washington Globe (standing in for the Post) is losing market share to tabloids and is under new management.  Trying to adapt, it has added an on-line division, including bloggers.  The traditional journalistic types (like the editor, played by Helen Mirren, and the rumpled journalist Cal McCaffrey [Russell Crowe]), tend to look down on the online folks.  However McCaffrey and a young blogger he initially despises, played by Rachel McAdams, eventually team up to sort out a DC political scandal, get the story out before the tabloids, and earn one another's respect.

The scandal has to do with a congressman, played by Ben Affleck, who was a college roommate of McCaffrey's and who is married to a woman with whom McCaffrey had been in love and had had an affair.  Now it seems that the congressman has been having an affair of his own with a staffer, and the staffer has ended up under the wheels of a DC Metro train.  Did she jump . . .?  Complicating matters is the fact that the congressman is chairing a committee that is looking into the employment of private security forces (""mercenaries""?) in Iraq, and his relations to his staffer complicate, in a variety of ways, his investigation into these private forces (modeled, I would guess, on Blackwater).  I don't want to spoil the plot, so I'll just say that a lot of the action comes down to the kind of tension generated by both not knowing whom you can trust AND not knowing if you are being observed or tailed (yes, there is an obligatory parking garage scene!).  All of that is handled well, though the very ending is maybe a bit hastily wrapped up.  There is one of these moments when you think everything is wrapped and the presses are ready to roll when someone says,""Wait a minute! How did X know Y?""  That's followed by a mad dash and a final twist -- THEN the presses roll.

What makes the movie work are good performances by good performers -- Crowe, Mirren, McAdams, Affleck, Robin Wright, Jeff Daniels, and, in fine cameos,  Viola Davis and, especially, Jason Bateman.  That's a strong cast.  Add to that a good feel for Washington and its halls and streets, and a nicely textured newspaper floor, where the parlous financial state of the paper is disguised by a sense of busy-ness and corporate gloss.  So . . . well worth seeing.

NOTE: I haven't seen the six-hour British TV series on which this is based.  I hear it's very good, with Bill Nighy in the Mirren part.",1395187200,4,2630,4.723684210526316

why is someone running ? perhaps we should have seen the theft.

3708985,2,B001N2MWGO,"The high ratings for the customer reviews led me to have higher expectations of this thriller. What it did do successfully was provide some food for thought on the relationships between corporations, media and the government. Given the situation the film portrayed, what hopes do we have for containing  corruption and keeping citizens informed? It also explores the relationships of three former college buddies--and how their chosen occupations impact their friendship.

Although the cast is a good one, none of the main characters were likable or interesting. Perhaps it was the lack of chemistry between (Cal) Russell Crowe and (Della)Rachel McAdams (both actors I have liked in other movies.) Their characters seemed flat. The defining characters of Cal were his bad hair, love of the Steelers (in Redskin territory no less) and his sloppiness. He is driven by his goal to uncover the truth, but that alone did not make him interesting. I could handle unlikable characters, but uninteresting characters present a problem because it makes it more difficult to care about their outcome. The humiliated wife (Robin Wright) showed some  depth and complexity, but unfortunately has limited screen time--and very little of that showed the dynamics of her marriage.

The movie also lacked the quick pacing and suspense that drives successful thrillers. It starts with an exciting sequence, but then slows down with the majority of the suspense were predictable.

Overall, the movie explores a worthy topic and has a good cast, but it falls short of expectations. I'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option. Since so many people liked this, it may be worthwhile for you to rent. Just keep your expectations in check and you won't be disappointed as my husband and I were.",1388880000,,1770,5.089655172413793

Affleck has a really central role, but he's WEAK! He is simply not believable as a Congressman, a man in love, or someone who is tortured. Crowe's sidekick (Della) was awful. Jeff Daniels was also miscast. He didn't seem like a bad guy Congressman at all. He should have been cast as the next door neighbor or something equally forgetable. Crowe did a great job with his role. So did Mirren, Wright, and Bateman. Too bad they were on screen so little. Had the good actors been chosen for the more principle roles, this could have been improved...

IF the writing had been better. I am not sure if this made sense to people who didn't see the British version, but so much was cut out that the threads hold together only loosely. It's still the same story, but with a lot less that makes it compelling. I was scratching my head saying, ""did that happen or didn't it?""

This piece is no exception, but I am giving it three stars because of the slow start, and even up until the end I still didn't find it ""thrilling"". What I do appreciate, however, is the plot twists and turns and general tension between characters. This movie was much more than who shot whom production. I don't want to spoil it, but on the whole this movie considers politics, the consequences of war, and the consequences of leaders in power - all still relevant topics for today.

Shout out to Helen Mirren - I love her playing the strong, older, polished, female head of newspaper role. We don't usually see newspaper editors as womenfolk.

I was informed that this was originally a TV series with James McAvoy in it - SCORE. I gotta see that! It might be even better because there are differences throughout the series . . . I eagerly await finding it and watching it.",1376611200,,1101,4.41871921182266
3709019,5,B001N2MWGO,"First of all, if a movie has Russell Crowe and Helen Mirren in it, how bad can it be?  This was a thoroughly intelligent and entertaining film, and once again Russel Crowe surprises you with the UN-ENDING various types of characters he chooses to play, and he is superb at all of them.",1376265600,,285,4.377358490566038

Not much to be said of a simple DVD - it works, and the film itself is excellent.

I use this in my journalism course to initiate discussions about being too close to your sources, the tabloid nature of journalism and also the importance of journalism and sticking with the story to get it right.

Also, the underlying debate between online and print journalism, for what it's worth, is interesting to note.",1375315200,,434,4.697368421052632

3709024,4,B001N2MWGO,"We enjoyed the movie and the acting was done very well.  It was difficult to follow at times and the ending was a surprise.  Russell Crowe looked like he need a haircut, shave and bath.  He played his part well, but his appearance didn't add much to the film.  I guess the bottom line on the film was that you can't trust anyone! It kept us entertained.",1375056000,3,353,4.223880597014926
3709025,4,B001N2MWGO,it was slow to start but the story line became very interesting as it went along with many twists and turns at the end,1374883200,,118,3.9583333333333335
3709026,3,B001N2MWGO,"Reporters love to uncover the indiscretions of politicians.  But what happens when the politician is a friend of the reporter?  Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a veteran reporter whose college buddy, Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), admits to having an affair with one of his staffers--a staffer who just happens to be dead.  Was it suicide?  Or was it murder?  Or is there something even more sinister going on?

State of play is your basic political thriller.  Government corruption; military conspiracies; and the dogged determination of the press in pursuing a story.  It also has a couple of plot twists that keep the watcher guessing.  The acting is serviceable all around, though not particularly Oscar-worthy.

The Blu-ray transfer is good--what one would expect from a recent release.  The visuals and audio are both crisp.  It does not matter all that much, however, because this movie does not have much in the way of special effects or scenic vistas.  It is mostly talking heads.  You watch this movie for the plot--to see how it turns out in the end.

Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for scenes of violence and some language, including sex-related dialogue, mostly stemming from a plotline involving adultery (not shown).  One character is apparently portrayed as a Christian, but it becomes clear that he is a hypocrite.  Since there are no positive portrayals of Christians to offset this character, the movie subtly implies that Christians (or at least Christian politicians) are hypocrites.

Apart from that, I found State of Play to be an interesting movie that kept me guessing.  The ending was not quite as satisfying as the build up promises.  But I would still recommend it if you like this kind of movie.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, this edition does offer improved quality.  But I am not sure if it is worth it, given the type of movie that it is.",1374624000,,1910,4.903125

3709036,5,B001N2MWGO,"This is a 2009 movie based on a BBC TV serial from 2003, though the original setting in London was changed in the movie to Washington D.C. Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is an experienced reporter working for the Washington Globe. He was in college with Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Afflick) who is now heading a Senate investigation into government private arms dealers, particularly PointCorp. Collins' principal researcher, Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), with whom he has been having an affair, is killed in a metro `accident'. Questions arise immediately as to whether Sonia's death was truly an accident, or suicide, or as emergent facts seem to suggest, murder. The newspaper's editor is Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) and she appoints a young staff reporter, Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) to assist McAffrey. In a seemingly unrelated incident a petty thief and pizza delivery man are shot dead, but it emerges that the thief stole a briefcase containing pictures of the Congressman with his mistress. It emerges that Sonia was in fact working undercover for PointCorp to monitor the congressional committee's investigation. The depths of the collusion and corruption between government and industry eventually emerge. This was great on BBC TV but even though its original 6 hours have been cut down to two, it is still a cracking thriller.",1370217600,,1341,5.212962962962963

3709038,4,B001N2MWGO,"A crime mystery plot more like Sherlock Holmes than CSI/Law & Order. Dialog and situation driven, it doesn't spend much time on the mechanics of investigation. Layers of personalities and information are added as the plot moves along, but not too much or too fast. Set in Washington DC, so it includes a moderately political aspect. Tension naturally increases. Dialog and characters are believable. Ending is satisfying.

A solidly scripted, entertaining movie. Worth the time.

Not for action junkies. Doesn't have the gratuitous gore of CSI fame.",1369872000,,549,5.2988505747126435

Developments come non-stop, are fragmented and overlaid with simultaneous developments in other threads of the story.  Lots of abrupt editing bangs us with truncated scene changes.  Helen Mirren spends her time unimaginatively barking and being foul mouthed.  The police detective is right out of TV.  The ending wrap up left me totally in the dark.  What IS the Congressman guilty of, WHY was he arrested?  Was his tough public questioning of the military outsourcing CEO sincere and, if so, why did he take the CEO aside in a corridor later and engage in fence mending and why was the CEO cordial?  Why did the assassin shoot the homeless girl who supplied the photographs?  It reminds me of the Amazon review of the remake of TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY where the couple watching it were so confused at the end they thought the mole was Smiley!",1369612800,,928,4.822784810126582

I like more mind puzzles which this one offered.  I'm still trying to figure out the thread of the plot.

Enjoyed the Washington backdrop and Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams and Ben Affleck's acting.  Would like to see more movies like this. 4.5 stars.",1369612800,,434,4.430379746835443
3709043,5,B001N2MWGO,"""State Of Play"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Handsome, unflappable U.S. Congressman Stephen Collins is the future of his political party: an honorable appointee who serves as the chairman of a committee overseeing defense spending. All eyes are upon the rising star to be his party's contender for the upcoming presidential race. Until his research assistant/mistress is brutally murdered and buried secrets come tumbling out.

D.C. reporter Cal McCaffrey has the dubious fortune of both an old friendship with Collins and a ruthless editor, Cameron, who has assigned him to investigate. As he and partner Della try to uncover the killer's identity, McCaffrey steps into a cover-up that threatens to shake the nation's power structures. And in a town of spin-doctors and wealthy politicos, he will discover one truth: when billions are at stake, no one's integrity, love or life is ever safe.

The cast led by Russell Crowe (as Cal McCaffrey), Ben Affleck (as Stephen Collins), Rachel McAdams (as Della Frye) & Helen Mirren (as Cameron Lynne) is excellent! The directing by Kevin MacDonald (who also directed ""The Last King Of Scotland"" (2006) is excellent! The screenplay (based on the television series by Paul Abbott) by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote the story and screenplay to ""The Kingdom"" (2007) & ""Lions For Lambs"" (2007, also produced), Tony Gilroy (who also wrote the screenplay to ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002), ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004), ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007, also wrote the screen story), he also wrote the story and screenplay and directed ""Michael Clayton"" (2007, also nominated for an Oscar for his story and screenplay and directing) & the recent ""Duplicity"" (2009), & Billy Ray (who also wrote the story and screenplay and directed ""Shattered Glass"" (2003), and also wrote the screenplay and directed ""Breach"" (2007) is excellent!

The music by Alex Heffes (who also did the music to ""The Last King Of Scotland"") is excellent! The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (who also did the cinematography to ""Babel"" (2006) and he was nominated for an Oscar for his work on ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005) is excellent! The film editing by Justine Wright (who also did the film editing to ""The Last King Of Scotland"") is excellent! The casting by Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting to ""American Gangster"" (2007, which was directed by Ridley Scott and co-starred Crowe), ""Body Of Lies"" (2008, which was also directed by Scott and also co-starred Crowe), ""Brokeback Mountain"", & the upcoming ""Public Enemies"" (2009) is excellent! The production design by Mark Friedberg (who also did the production design to ""Identity"" (2003) & Synecdoche, New York"" (2008) is excellent! The art direction by Richard L. Johnson (who also did the art direction to ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008) & the upcoming ""The Last Airbender"" (2010) & Adam Stockhausen (who also did the art direction to ""Synecdoche, New York"") is excellent! The set decoration by Cheryl Carasik (who also did the set decoration to ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" (2006, which she was nominated for an Oscar for her work) & ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" (2007) is excellent! The costume design by Jacqueline West (who was nominated for an Oscar for her work on ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" (2008) & ""Quills"" (2000) is excellent!

This is an excellent and interesting political thriller that keeps you thinking and makes you think as well. An excellent cast led by Crowe, Affleck, McAdams, and Mirren, make this movie worth while. This is one of the better films of the year.",1369526400,,3597,5.101867572156197

Everything fit together well and made complete sense.  I always like that in a movie with such deep drama.  If it doesn't fit together right, then what's the point.

However.....
The movie deserves 5 stars because in the truth, the beltway bandit syndrome (sickness)is alive and well unfortunately, but The movie's ending goes the whole way.....that is to the printing presses, Unlike ""Three Days Of The Condor""

3709049,4,B001N2MWGO,"Loved the movie and the story line is a good one.  I found myself cheering on a couple involved in a prison breakout, which I find amazing to me.  I have known a couple of people who were wrongly accused and sent to prison, which destroyed their lives, and this is why I do not support the Death Penalty.  Not every one in prison is guilty, and we have a criminal system which falls short of honor; including judges who are tainted along with the prosecutors who are only interested in their career.  We do not have justice here in the U.S.  This is not to say that there are many in prison who are guilty and need to be just where they are.  It goes to show that it takes money to win a case, just like in the OJ Simpson case; money is the key whether you go to prison, or are released.  Not everyone has the luxury of having money to fight their case.  Just look at Washington and see the criminals there who should be in prison now and they are never going to go to prison due to power and money.",1367625600,,999,4.061224489795919

3709056,1,B001N2MWGO,"Spoiler Alert!! Multiple Spoilers Alert!!
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on this.  I've already wasted enough time on this movie.  I just think that if one is going to go to all the trouble and expense of producing a life and death thriller with layered conspiracies it should at least be able to stand up to a casual viewing without numerous plot holes and goofs being noticeable.  Here are just three:

1) How did the assassin manipulate the young woman into standing right on the edge of the subway loading area which just happened to be one of only three ""blind spots"" in the passenger loading area?  If the Metro officials have security cameras monitoring the area why would there be a ""blind spot"" where passengers get on and off the train?

2) A closeup of the Gulf War army buddies group photo is onscreen at 37:55 into the movie.  The camera cuts away for a few seconds and then we see the closeup of the photo again.  This time the photo has obviously been altered from just a few seconds ago.  The smiling face of the soldier at the far right (Bingham) has been changed to the unsmiling face of the actor playing the assassin and both his and Affleck's character's face have very obviously been superimposed on the corresponding men in the photo.  It's instantly noticeable, so obvious and amateurishly done that I did a double take, immediately paused the dvd, and scrolled back and forth between the two closeups of the photo several times to confirm the significant differences.  I'm really surprised that someone didn't catch this glaring error before the movie was released.

3) During the scene where Collins ""comes clean"" at the newspaper office, the scene cuts back and forth between the Collins monologue and the assassin Bingham in his room alone solemnly and somewhat ritualistically dressing in his fatigues and assembling his assault rifle much like a matador dressing in preparation for going into the ring.  He phones someone (who is he calling?!) with his cell and ominously leaves a message saying, in part, ""I want to assure you that I am ready to finish what we started"".  I guess the director is trying to  throw one more twist`into the plot by misleading the audience into believing that Bingham, who we have been led to believe has been working for the ""bad corporate mercenary defense contractor"", is preparing to kill Collins.  However, after it is revealed in the big, climactic confrontation between Cal and Collins that Bingham has actually been working for Collins the whole time, that means that, logically, the only person he could have been leaving that message for is Collins.  So why is he on the sidewalk with his assault rifle across the street from Collins office when Cal comes out?  Where are the several police officers who were loitering in front as Collins is shown entering his office building?  What was the finishing action Bingham intended to accomplish when he left the message for Collins that he was ready to finish what they had started?

Bonus) How did a young woman whose only notable job experience was ""waitressing"" become the lead researcher for a congressional committee that was investigating a multi-billion dollar defense contractor?  And with that job history how did she get a credit card that would allow her to run up a $40,0000 debt?

Oh yeah, if you have an old cell phone you're no longer using and a garbage disposal you don't mind breaking, turn it on and toss that old cell phone into it, taking care to run a little water at the same time as Bingham does.  It'll make a lot of racket but it won't destroy the phone.  Is this a common practice when people want to get rid of a cell phone?  It seems like a 10 second scene showing him removing the battery and SIM card from the phone and throwing the three items into different dumpsters or garbage cans would have made a lot more sense, or just throwing it out the window of his moving car.  Where did this ""lost grunt"" get his covert agent training and why is he willing to murder 4 strangers?",1363996800,4,4033,4.645070422535211

3709065,4,B001N2MWGO,"This is a great rainy-Sunday movie for between your favorite sports seasons. The plot is complex and convoluted, so having the 'Pause/Reverse' button nearby is helpful. The characters are thinly drawn and the story line predictable. Helen Mirren is especially harsh, without giving the audience a sense of what is driving her. Crowe is his usual blustery self, McAdam an idealistic new media kid driven to succeed -- without knowing what success in the newspaper business looks like.

Robin Wright Penn gives a terrific performance, though in a secondary role, as the wife of a Senator (Ben Affleck) caught up in -- what else? -- scandal and intrigue.

The core of the story is the relationship between reporter (Crowe) and politician (Affleck) who in this version are supposed to be... old college roommates?  The film is mis-cast.  Affleck appears to young, Crowe too old for the personal dynamics that we are supposed to invest in to drive the story.  Good writing, solid direction and entertaining support from Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams can't leap over this hurdle.  The actors originally cast in the lead roles:  a re-teaming of the ""Fight Club"" duo of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.  Too bad Hollywood scheduling couldn't allow for that pair - their established dynamic would have been a great engine for this occasionally thrilling drama.",1359763200,,822,5.08955223880597

My only question is how did I miss this one?  It was only out about five years ago and I don't remember seeing it advertised at all.  In fact, Amazon sent it to me as one of my recommendations and I only checked out the trailer because Crowe was in it...and it grabbed me right away.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes edge-of-your-seat  military/political intrigue.

Everything about the movie contributes to creating a well paced, tight, action movie that keeps one wondering how it will end. The story is timely and although it has some liberal agenda overtones these are not so blatant as to compromise the movie.

There was one small problem and that was the surround sound sometimes drowned out the dialog and made it difficult to follow the plot. The solution was to activate the English captions and that solved the problem. This is one of those movies where the dialog counts for something.

The cast members are all great: Russell Crowe as usual nails it; Rachel McAdams is wonderful; Ben Affleck is a solid actor; Helen Mirren, the best; Robin Wright, A+, and Jason Bateman -- he's great! -- and Viola Davis and everyone else make this so entertaining and fun to watch.
The twist at the end surprised me.
In the end, it's about the changing of the newspaper business as well as corruption and the face off between good and evil, truth and lies in government.
The tradition of newspapers is disappearing and this movie honors it and also mourns its passing...Even though there is so much about the news profession that is invasive and distasteful, good reporters, whose pursuit is truth are invaluable.
I love the setting and mood this movie creates...set in Washington D.C., lots of rain, shadowy nights, suspenseful encounters in unusual places, all well done.",1348358400,2,1026,4.8352272727272725

The American people need to be reminded about who is really in charge of a very large part of American society - the U.S. military and their weapon-making buddies. But instead we see a story about a courageous man standing up to those in power ending up being a lunatic himself! This is a very disturbing film that basically shouts from the rooftops: ""All politicians are either corrupt pimps or just plain nuts! There are no good guys (or gals) in political power! This is a very demoralizing story that I regret having spent my hard earned money on - especially during a recession!

A few other messages wacky messages one can gather from this film: If you save someone's life in wartime they owe you a debt that means killing innocent people in order to save your buddy's political career! You can't tell your best friend is mentally disturbed even though you've known him for about 30+ years, since you were college roommates! Someone who has the courage to challenge incredibly powerful & corrupt corporations is just as bad as the bad guys! Some ex-hippy journalist is going to save the day because his cursing editor is mere putty in his hands, even though he is working at a large city newspaper! A 20-something blogger can rise to the occasion simply because she has ""dewy eyes!"" Wow! What a dopey and demoralizing story!

There is a man running in the street at night. A man shoots two people with a silenced pistol. In the morning a car drives on a street; Cal is a reporter and questions a detective. A congressman learns of a death of an employee in the subway. The reporter tells about one victim. Congressman Stephen Collins learns of the death of a researcher in the subway. Collins is looking into a Defense Dept. contractor's operations. Collins is questioned, he is advised to ""lay low"" for now. The `Washington Globe' has new owners who want to turn a profit. Was the death of Sonya a suicide? Cal visits his old college roommate. Collins says it wasn't a suicide! (He had a phone call from her.) Cal McCaffrey calls a reporter and offers a tip about the subway security cameras. No luck! But the research goes on.

Cal talks to Ann Collins. Then he goes to a morgue to check out one of the shot victims. He checks the numbers on this victim's cell phone - there is a link to Sonya! A woman offers to sell Cal something stolen by her boyfriend Deshawn, another victim. He had photos of Collins! Who wanted Sonya dead? Those bullets left a clue to the killer. One of the shooting victims may be coming out of a coma. Shots through a window kill a patient. The police question Cal about those photos. The newspaper investigation will go on. So does the Congressional investigation into Point Corp. Doors slam in a reporter's face. They look for Sonya's former roommate. The subway camera has a photo of a man. Was he at the hospital? Cal meets an inside source. Point Corp wants to take over domestic security. Collins explains how.

Cal interviews Collins' wife about a possible deal; he didn't have the cash. A source talks to Cal about the man in the photo. Cal looks for the man at that address. Is he in danger in the parking garage? The police arrive. Cal learns about Deshawn's girlfriend; she won't talk to the police. Do corporations use scandals to destroy political opponents? [Yes.] They investigate the lobbyist for Point Corp. Can they get him on tape? They talk in a motel room. The more Dominic talks, the more he is protected. He tells about Sonya, she was planted on Collins! We learn more about Sonya's history. There is an unexpected event! Collins is angry and upset over this story. Can questions Congressman Ferguson, he tells his story and threatens Cal. Can this story be published? Collins tells his story and provides corroboration. Cal wonders how Ann Collins knew what Sonya earned? Collins tells about Bingham following Sonya. This is a shocking surprise! ""I lied."" The police arrive as Cal leaves the building, just in time. The typed headlines tells what happened next.

The pacing of this story could be better, and, the ending detracts from the main story due to its corrupt character. The best fiction is based on true events (if you can recognize it). This story seems based on the disappearance and death of a young woman who was an intern for a Congressman some years ago. He was investigating the actions of a Defense contractor at the time. The investigation of her disappearance revealed their personal relationship. Some wondered at the time if this was an attempt to end his career by her disappearance.

I do not believe the casting of this film was well thought out. Neither Russell Crowe nor Helen Mirren appeal to the characters they are playing. The scenes skip quickly as many modern day films do. It is not confusing, just delivers a different form of entertainment (at least for me).

3709149,2,B001N2MWGO,"About 95 percent of my problem with this film was with the lead actor.  This was an excellent story -- taken from the thrilling BBC miniseries of the same name -- with an otherwise great cast, good script, good director; but Russell Crowe stuck out in this like a saguaro cactus among orchids, and not in a good way.  He just didn't belong, and he didn't do that great a job: he was phoning in his performance, based on an outdated, stereotypical view of what dedicated journalists are supposed to be like.  I just couldn't buy him as a serious journalist (sorry, but I am one -- in Chicago, where great journalism, like politics, is a spectator sport).  The really good investigative journalists don't drink much anymore (if they ever did), or they wouldn't be able to do the work.  Moreover, they know they've got younger, hipper reporters nipping at their heels and managements who'd rather hire the newbies than seasoned reporters because the former cost less, so it's pretty competitive.  But it's still not like the Brit tabloids: we have rules, and ethics.  And all that is still different if you're part of the DC press corps, which tends to have more of a herd mentality than we do (remember, Woodward and Bernstein bucked the trend, and they were metro reporters, not on the political beat).  All that said, Russell Crowe, besides being obnoxious and sloppy in this role, just doesn't have credibility as a still-hungry beat reporter trying to get a scoop, keep his ethics, and still keep his job.

I thought about whom I would have liked to have seen in the role instead, and both John Cusack and Gary Sinise come to mind.  Sure, they've been wasted lately (Sinise on TV and Cusack in disaster/horror films and romantic comedies), but these guys are in the right age bracket and they really have the chops.  Either one of them playing opposite Helen Mirren would have made the screen crackle (and Ben Affleck would have been running to catch up, but he probably would have notched up his performance a bit to compensate, and that would've been good).  I recently watched Grace Is Gone and Truman again, so I was pointedly reminded of what Cusack and Sinise are capable.  They're a thinking gal's actors: like Clooney, they can seriously step up when you give them challenging material.  Russell Crowe??  Not so much.  Give him a swashbuckling role or one of a world-weary cop wherein he still gets to smash a few heads, and he's fine; but don't give him a serious interior drama that requires too much thought, 'cause he'll disappoint.  As he does here.  I found his performance to be terribly distracting, and that considerably damaged me following the action.

Helen Mirren (love her! what a tart, snappy boss she made), Affleck, Rachel McAdams, and Robin Wright acquitted themselves well enough, but I can't help but think that even Mirren and Affleck would have done better if they'd had Sinise or Cusack to push back against.  Comparing this to the original Brit production, I'd give the Brits five stars and this two, mostly because of Crowe's failed role (without him, it'd be more like three and a half to four stars; and with Cusack or Sinise?  Whoa.  *That's* competition).",1322870400,,3194,4.7481884057971016

After a woman appears to have committed suicide by jumping into the path of a speeding D.C. subway train, married Congressman Stephan Collins, played by Affleck, is linked in a romantic relationship with the dead girl. Collins institutes the help of long time friend Cal McCaffrey, played by Crowe, to find out the truth behind the girl's death and help clear his name.

Cal goes on an all out hunt with the help of D.C. reporter Della Frye, played by McAdams, to discover the truth, which in politics is never, ever what it seems. Helen Mirren plays a wonderful supporting role as Cameron Lynn, the newspaper editor that Crowe and McAdams work for.
'State Of Play' is an edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is racy with an ever constant government conspiracy theory looming over its story line and characters.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I was never able to decipher the 'conspiracy' until the end.

The world of private defense contractors in a post 9/11 world figures heavily in the proceedings, and do the current trials and tribulations of the newspaper business. The movie never sacrifices its smarts in its mission to entertain and, despite the private defense contractor angle, doesn't go for easy villains and cheap shots.

3709155,5,B001N2MWGO,EXCELLENT MOVIE. GREAT CAST.  HIGHLY SUSPENSEFUL.RUSSELL CROWE WAS WONDERFUL.  ON THE EDGE OF THE SEAT THE ENTIRE MOVIE.!!!! REAL THRILLER!,1301184000,,139,5.9
3709156,4,B001N2MWGO,"Lots of people say the BBC series this movie is based on is better than the Hollywood remake. It's a good series and has an amiable scruffiness, to match its hero -- but in the Hollywood rewrite, its plotting has been cleaned up by pros, and it needed some cleaning up.

The original series (see Wikipedia) was made up as it went along, and the writer changed villains in the middle. There are not just loose ends, which several of the critics here have discussed, but loose ends that stick out and hit the viewer in the eye. I can't give away the plot, but the loose ends are LIKE a killer planning to hide his activities who writes letters to the papers about them.

The Hollywood rewrite improves or gets rid of these clumsinesses.

The love affair between the lead and the congressman's wife was a big problem in the tv series, and can be more fully discussed here because it doesn't give away any of the mystery plot points. In the tv series, the wife is upset her husband was having an affair, so she comes on to the husband's best friend. The husband freaks, but continues to see the best friend because he needs his help -- then every once in a while insults the best friend because, hey, the guy is sleeping with his wife. The wife plans to go back with the husband as soon as she finds out he was framed, even in the very first super hot days of her passion for the other guy. Finally she gets mad at both of them because they're not considering her ... instead of being grateful that neither of them is mad at her! In the end she walks off hurt, though she's gotten sex, love and apologies from both and could stay with either man if she chose.

In the movie, by contrast, the affair between the wife and the best friend is long in the past, and the husband has gotten over resenting it, though he sniffs about it at one point. The wife kind of wants to start up again with the hero but he tells her no, so she is almost forced back to her husband. All very mature and quite understandable. Hollywood seldom passes up the chance for heated sex play, but Hollywood was smart enough to see it didn't quite work in the BBC series and wouldn't work in the Hollywood rewrite either. Both Hollywood lovers looked middle-aged and sensible; the BBC wife looked like 40-year-old sex goddess and her lover looked like a helpless child when she came after him. Score: Hollywood 1, BBC 0 on understanding of adult sex.

I watched both shows in the evening. It took three days, two one-hour episodes a day, to get through the BBC series. It took one evening to get through the Hollywood remake. Shorter is better. The political issue everyone was getting all excited about was a Maguffin, and changed between London and Hollywood, as if to prove it didn't matter what it was. The BBC series had muddy exposition and didn't start to move until its third hour, getting truly fast-paced only in its last third. The Hollywood version was crisp and fast-paced throughout.

All these improvements are only to be expected from a professional rewrite on a high-budget production. Hollywood has the resources to do this stuff right, and this is the kind of thing Hollywood specializes in.",1300924800,2,3177,4.468965517241379
3709157,3,B001N2MWGO,"Overall, not a bad movie to watch, complete with the twists and turns of a suspense.
It follows the story of a newpaper man (Russell Crowe) who stumbles across a story that connects back to a close friend of his, a Senator (Ben Affleck) no less who is currently serving on a committe holding hearings on a particular government contractor.  The newsmen ends up paired with a sidekick, a much younger news/blogger female, which leads to some nice generational conflicts.
The movie, is loosely based on a mini-series of the same name, that I had not heard of nor have I seen, so I can't compare it.
Generally it does okay with the story, it was a little too slow in parts, and I feel the story didn't need all the sensationalist type twists in it.  Plus it needed a little more meat and potatoes, depth, in the character development department as well.  I didn't believe Affleck in his role.  He's a great actor, just feel this role wasn't the part for him.  Crowe did what he could with what he had, and would have preferred a tad more friction and opposition between him and the blogger.  Some nice shots from the director that were nicely unexpected.  It did loose me in parts, because I couldn't keep track of who had done what.  Mirren did a good job as the battle-ax-editor.  Adored to infinity Jason Bateman's character, hands down the most interesting and developed one.

3709158,2,B001N2MWGO,"Take a story about the failing newspaper industry and the government's use of private security firms here and abroad (forgetting to include any big moments of action or intense drama), and add in a cast of great stars and character actors doing mediocre performances, and you get ""State of Play"". I enjoy thrillers and based on the cast, I expected a lot more in this movie. There were a couple of plot twists that kept it from being completely predictable and perhaps one or two thrilling scenes, but that was it. This is a movie which doesn't succeed in saying much and doesn't make you feel much at all. I never saw the BBC series it was based on, so I cannot make comparisons. There were times it felt like the movie itself was a TV show of only so-so quality; the original might've been much better.

Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, an old school reporter working at the Washington Globe, a newspaper recently bought by a new media conglomerate and fighting to stay afloat. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, the upstart blogger working at the paper who begins with very different ideas on reporting. A story starts to unfold where Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is at the center of a standard political scandal. He's on a panel investigating PointCorp, a private firm hired by the government for security overseas and at home, when Sonia, a researcher on the case whom he was having an affair with, is killed. McAffrey forms a theory about a conspiracy and partners with Frye to investigate. To complicate matters, Collins is an old friend of McAffrey, and in the past McAffrey had an affair with Collins's wife.

Thus the standard plot of an evil security firm doing anything to make money is laid out, along with a politician having an affair. Several times the movie demonstrates how newspapers are being pushed aside in favor of online news; however, it never seems to make a strong case for print media. The only case made is that reporters regardless of their media need to follow leads and be diligent in researching. I couldn't help but think when they were submitting a story to be printed that many people probably would've already read the news online by then or seen it on TV.

Part of my problem with the movie is that it never made me care strongly about any of the characters. Crowe is a wonderful actor but he showed little emotion here. Helen Mirren demonstrated more emotion as the newspaper editor, but the only emotion seemed to be anger. Despite what his character was going through, Affleck didn't seem to show much emotion outside of one scene.

The movie started with a cookie cutter plot and aside from a couple of plot twists did little to grab my attention. There was nothing special about the action sequences (few that there were) or the cinematography. And whether it was the acting, the script, or the directing, none of the characters really stood out or elicited much emotion.",1284163200,5,2923,4.703125

3709161,2,B001N2MWGO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I haven't seen the 2003 British mini-series the American version is based on, but I understand the screenwriters pared down the story considerably to the point where 'State of Play' is virtually all plot with little character development. Take the Russell Crowe Cal McAffrey protagonist--he's a bit of a scruffy Luddite whose cubicle at work is a mess and he drives an old beat up Saab. He's pitted against the Rachel McAdams Della Frye blogger and they're supposed to have some chemistry together with the old style reporter going toe to toe with the gossip driven online maven. I wanted to see more of McAffrey's idiosyncrasies but he along with Della get so caught up in the machinations of the plot, that there's no time to find out anything about their personalities. Yes, McAffrey has an affair with Anne Collins ( Robin Penn Wright), the wife of his old friend Representative Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) but it's all pretty standard stuff and by the time the film is over, we wonder if any of the characters have any kind of inner life.

As a plot driven movie, 'State of Play' has enough plot holes to seriously question the entire enterprise. Take for example, the murder of Collin's attractive assistant, Sonia Baker. We never see how she meets her end in the train station and how can the news media immediately assume it was a suicide? We do find out later that she was murdered but in a crowded train station, weren't there any witnesses? Nor is the police investigation ever shown. In real life, the news media would not at all be so quick to assume that Baker took her own life. No one is seen questioning this view which would be the opposite of what would occur in reality. I did read on Wikipedia that the producers were not allowed to show any scenes of violence in the train station as its owners strictly prohibited any association of the station with violent behavior.

Now Cal manages to obtain photos of Sonia from some homeless woman whose fellow addict was shot dead by the psycho soldier who used to work for military contractors in Iraq. I refuse to believe that a couple of bumbling crack-heads could so easily boost a briefcase from a soldier who is supposed to be some sort of professional assassin. Do we ever see that scene where the briefcase is stolen? Of course not! It's just too easy and convenient a way for Cal to obtain his next lead--Sonia's phone number is on the crack-head's cell phone!

As for Representative Collin's assertion that PointCorp, the military contractor he's been investigating in his congressional hearings, has taken over the nation's security both overseas and DOMESTICALLY, where is the proof of that? It sounds like that the films' scenarists approve of the assumption they place in the mouth of Ben Affleck's mercurial Congressman. 'State of Play' is now reduced to another one of those silly Oliver Stone-like conspiracy flicks, where shady quasi-governmental agencies are linked to the nastiest of intentions!

What about this PointCorp insider who so easily points Cal in the direction of Sonia's assassin? If PointCorp's tentacles reach so far and wide, wouldn't this insider have been under surveillance? Wouldn't they have had Cal under surveillance and realized that their security was being compromised by one of their own? The screenwriters pull the insider out of a hat which ultimately gives the filmmakers an excuse to stage the Cal-Army Psycho stalking scene in the parking garage.

Through Della's side of the investigation, she figures out by exploring the purloined photos, that oily PR executive Dominic Foy (well played by Jason Bateman), worked for a PointCorp subsidiary and can connect Sonia to PointCorp. Cal's unethical side is exposed when he blackmails Foy into spilling the beans.

State of Play's ending just failed to pay off. Collins finally admits to his old buddy Cal that he had suspicions that Sonia was working for PointCorp. He hires an old Army buddy who used to work for PointCorp but now hates them (not exactly sure why). The buddy, Army Corporal Bingham, turns out to be the psycho assassin. Collins insists that he had no idea that Bingham would kill Sonia. So if that's the case, why is Collins arrested at the end of the film? Where is the proof that he actually intended to murder Sonia? If Bingham was acting on his own, then can Collins really be considered liable for Sonia's death? Finally, there's the ludicrous finale where Bingham attempts to shoot Cal on an open street as the police close in. He could have finished Cal off at any point before the final scene but chooses to let himself be trapped and ultimately gunned down by the police (how about taking Cal out from a distance in a high-rise, just as he killed the pizza deliveryman who was just waking up from the coma in the hospital?).

If you're willing to suspend your disbelief about the implausible scenes in 'State of Play', you might enjoy the film for the capable acting and numerous twists and turns in the plot. Those 'twists and turns' are for the most part not particularly believable at all, but 'Play' will indeed hold your interest--in a run-of-the-mill sort of way!",1283385600,4,5200,4.808724832214765

Veteran journalist Cal McAffrey (brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) stumbles onto a story that involves his former college roommate and now U. S. Congressman Stephen Collins (played by Ben Affleck).  McAffrey fights constant pressure from his editor
Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) who is trying to save her newspaper from bankruptcy,

As Cal begins to investigate,  cub reporter Della Frye (Rachael McAdams) harasses him for information she needs for a different scoop that may involve his Congressman friend.  Della, the newspapers blogger, has Cameron Lynne's support.  Should Cal trust Della to avoid Tattler tactics and emphasize factual reporting instead?

""State of Play"", while enticing us with political and corporate greed and corruption, baits us with subplots detailing the threat to traditional newspapers, and the sexual gamesmanship of congressional power brokers.  Who can Cal trust when seeking the  truth?  Will Cal threaten his long friendship with Congressman Collins while digging for details involving the death of the Congressman's aide?  Can the newspaper survive against corporate pressure to put profits ahead of impartial reporting?

This film presents a realistic political plot with great acting and superior settings.  ""State of Play"" is such a masterful mystery, it becomes a film one would enjoy viewing several times. I highly recommend ""State of Play"".",1279843200,3,1669,5.563492063492063
3709166,3,B001N2MWGO,"A lot of the movie is handled deftly, well-cast, and crisp dialog.  The problem overall is that there are too many coincidences, tangled and questionable relationships, and trying to hold the unraveling threads together gets to be annoying. The insider aspects of the washington world get cartoonish at times and you need to accept them stylistically to enjoy the film.  The coincidences about the stolen briefcase, the reporter's relationship with someone's wife, the ending twist about the wife knowing about the $26,000 a month and discovering the killer's true employer, a bit over the top and sloppy.  The movie tried to create too much subtext and complications, but it wasn't properly developed.  Again, deft in places, but only average because of annoyances.",1278720000,2,766,5.254098360655738
3709167,5,B001N2MWGO,"When this big screen American version of the addictive and celebrated BBC mini-series sank without a sound at the box office, despite a stellar cast, people began writing off the whole notion of the grown-up movie as popular entertainment. Hope the rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated, and by all means catch up with this terrific film.

The story, inspired by the Gary Condit episode, revolves around the apparent suicide of a congressional researcher in the D.C. metro, and how her death is interconnected with her boss (Ben Affleck), the Blackwater-like military outsourcer he's investigating, and two seemingly motiveless street shootings. These crimes are being covered by a reporter for the Post-like Washington Globe, a paunchy and bedraggled throwback played by Russell Crowe. The editor at his newly conglomerate owned paper eventually pairs him up with a blogger from their online arm (Rachel McAdams). These two form an unlikely partnership and their journey from wary colleagues to a cohesive, mutually respectful team, is just one way this film pays tribute to the classic ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.

Crowe is low-key, yet sensational. His lines touting the power of the press, might be hokey coming from a less compelling actor, but I bought it all from him. He's simply great in what's an old-fashioned star turn. And he builds a wonderful dynamic with McAdams, who deftly shows us her path from smug newbie to resourceful reporter. As usual, she's also completely adorable, with a ravishing smile and a beautiful voice.

The relationship between these two characters, and what they represent in terms of today's media landscape, are the heart of the story, and the issues addressed are really interesting. The film is more a high-tension drama than a thriller. The one kind of suspense set-piece is that old standby, our hero being menaced in an underground garage, another allusion to ATPM. It's well done, if fairly standard, but Crowe does have a pretty novel escape.

The reporter's investigation is complicated by Crowe's friendship with the Congressman under suspicion as well as the congressman's wife, played by Robin Wright-Penn. She's a bit underused compared to her counterpart in the mini-series, but she has some biting and effectively played scenes with Crowe.

I'm not a Ben Affleck hater, but if there's a weak link in the cast, he's it. He's a good seven years too young to be a contemporary of both Crowe and Wright-Penn; their characters all went to college together. And he doesn't convince as a congressman who's going places. More importantly, as the stakes in the story increase, we don't get a sense of his responses escalating with the crisis. He's good, but frankly, everyone else is better. That includes Helen Mirren as the paper's editor, in a role that was originally owned by an in-the-zone Bill Nighy. Jason Bateman brings his serio-comic perfect pitch to the part of a sleazy source, but as in UP IN THE AIR, he's almost too strong a presence to keep playing these cameos.

This is a great D.C. movie, and vividly captures the feel of the city. The production design is also terrific, though it's amusing to note that character's apartments and offices are comically crowded with tchotkis that tell us where they're from. The film also has a really good musical score.

This is a sophisticated entertainment delivered with filmmaking style and well-played scenes that have real dramatic heft. Perhaps it makes a somewhat sentimental case for the press by bringing back the muckraking newspaper picture. But, at the same time the movie doesn't shy away from the fact that the reporter's actions have consequences. They're clearly imperfect and they make mistakes. And despite his lofty justifications, the Crowe character is really pretty anti-heroic in some of his actions. And the underlying conspiracy here is pretty bold in it's real-world implications as well, and pulls fewer punches than more explicitly Iraq War themed films like THE GREEN ZONE.

Crowe's understated magnetism and McAdams high-wattage charm ensure that I'll re-visit this picture again from time-to-time.",1278633600,2,4133,5.130757800891531

Beside the first two scenes and the names of the characters, little else is in common between the two versions.  In the UK series, you have a professional newspaper team piecing together an set of seemingly unrelated events.  In the US version, you have Russel Crowe as a 60s hippie quipping his way through two hours of nonsensical quips.  Instead of a professional editor providing guidance, you have Helen Mirren's embarrassing role as a 'Katharine Graham' clone.  Even though the movie is 1/3 as long there is 5 times as many shhot-em-up scenes.  Don't waste you time with this version, get the UK series.",1275091200,3,764,4.786259541984733

3709171,3,B001N2MWGO,"""State of Play"" is a product of Hollywood's quest to meld timely political commentary with edge-of-your-seat entertainment. It succeeds with some qualifications. In Washington, DC, newspaperman Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) investigates a double shooting that left one man dead and another comatose, both struck by customized bullets, executioner style. Meanwhile, Congressman Steven Collins (Ben Affleck) is leading a highly-publicized investigation of Pointcorp, a private military contractor, when he learns that his mistress and chief researcher, Sonia Baker, has been killed. The deaths begin to look suspicious to McAffrey, and when he finds a connection between Baker and the dead man, he reluctantly teams up with gossip columnist Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a colleague at The Washington Globe, to track down both stories.

This film is based on a 6-hour BBC series, which I have not seen. But compressing it into 2 hours inevitably leaves ""State of Play"" scant on character development and political intrigue and a little too short to support a couple of sudden changes in direction. It alludes to a swirl of current events, though, such as the investigation into Blackwater, Chandra Levy's 2001 murder, and oily lobbies, PR firms, and politicians. Its ambition to portray Pointcorp's private army as a threat to democratic processes and criminal justice falls short, as too many other plot points distract us from it, but Rep. Collins does take a few sharp stabs at the risks of putting private armies on the public's payroll.

The film's strongest point may be the abrasive competition between hardworking investigative reporter McAffrey and the younger new-copy-every-hour Frye. It's the old media against the new media, as the newspaper tries to save itself from extinction by jumping on the blogging bandwagon and giving good old-fashioned journalism short shrift. In ""State of Play""'s idealistic world, those pavement-pounding investigative journalists are brave guardians of journalism's integrity who will track down the truth and print it for all to see, as opposed to the print-what-sells-and-print-it-fast crowd. But here the ambitious, if not quite ethical, young reporter is really quite capable and wants to be like the more complicated and righteous McAffrey. So they team up, and it's all for the good.

That makes ""State of Play"" a journalism movie more than a political one in my mind. The crisis in journalism seems greater than the one on Capital Hill that the movie is about. But this is a well-paced thriller, thinly drawn, but with plenty of tension and a strong cast. Whatever one may say about Russell Crowe, he is not vain, and he plays a scruffy, self-righteous, pot-bellied reporter convincingly. Helen Mirren plays his boss, The Washington Globe's hard-nosed editor-in-chief who is put upon to turn a profit under new corporate management. She doesn't have a lot to do, but she gives the role the necessary weight. ""State of Play"" tries to do a lot of things without doing any in much depth. The plot is too improbable to be convincing. But it entertains, and some of the parts are better than the whole.",1273881600,3,3143,5.21980198019802

3709173,5,B001N2MWGO,"This 2009  film just became available on my cable movie channel.  When I saw the lineup of the cast I was surprised that I had never heard of it before.  Somehow  it never got the publicity or the buzz that it deserves and the only reward it received was one for Russell Crowe for best actor at some Australian film festival. This surprised me because this is a really fine film, full of suspense and intrigue.  It kept me wide awake with my eyes glued to the screen as I followed the rather dense but yet easy to follow plot.

The story is set in Washington DC in a newspaper office.  Russell Crowe is a veteran reporter and the film depicts all the modern problems that newspapers have.  For example, there is initial conflict between Crowe and young bright blogger Rachel McAdams who winds up partnering with him in investigating the seemingly accidental death of a mistress of a congressmen played by Ben Affleck.  Helen Mirren is cast as the newspaper editor who is looking for the headline that will sell papers. That's just the basic storyline but the plot is much more complicated than that.  Political in nature it brings out the abuses of a security firm in Iraq which employs mercenary soldiers and corruption at many levels of government.

I found the story fast paced, believable and as fresh as today's headlines.  And I felt like I discovered this small gem of a film by accident.  Don't miss it!",1272153600,,1411,4.573705179282869

The movie with Russell Crowe has excellent acting, of course, but it doesn't have the detail that creates a good story's intensity.

3709179,2,B001N2MWGO,"This is an example of a really, really good idea for a movie that went wrong somewhere in production. The cast was good, particularly Russell Crowe as Cal, the middle-aged and disillusioned reporter, and Ben Affleck as a senator who's trying to do the right thing. Less successfully cast is Helen Mirren, who plays Cal's boss at the newspaper with an inexplicable English accent. There's even a bunch of twists to keep you watching. The only problem with the film is that it just tries too hard. By the end, you will have been expected to believe quite a few unnecessary twists, the last one being riddled with plot holes. Honestly, I watched the movie with two other people (and none of us are college dropouts, mind you), and between the three of us we could not figure out exactly what the ending meant to say.

Cinematography is good enough, and the thriller storyline is intriguing at first. There are a couple of well-executed intense moments where you worry for characters in peril. But none of this saves it from a near-fatal flaw: aside from a likable protagonist, none of the characters matter all that much. Even the twist ending just falls flat. Honestly, the whole thing just feels like a less enjoyable version of ""Edge of Darkness."" What makes this sad is that Edge of Darkness isn't even such a great movie. However, it was more enjoyable than this. At least the plot made sense, and you grew attached to the characters. ""Edge"" was on the whole more believable as well. This movie has a seriously flawed final showdown, which is even more embarrassing since the whole movie up to that point was trying to be realistic. (To top it off, there's an anti-military vibe to the whole movie)

Save your money. This is an embarrassing movie, considering the skilled talent involved. It only gets two stars because there were a few decent scenes. If you want a good thriller, see Unbreakable or The Fugitive.",1269302400,5,1915,4.696428571428571

3709181,5,B001N2MWGO,"It is so refreshing to see a 'suspense thriller' genre film that does not star building explosions and car chases as the main characters.  STATE OF PLAY demands that the audience stay tuned in throughout this fine plot, so nimble are its twists and turns that it is easy to get lost unless focus is maintained.  Matthew Carnahan, Tony Gilroy, and Billy Ray have adapted the television series by Paul  Abbott, handed it over to Director Kevin Macdonald who in turn has placed this dazzling story in the capable hands of some terrific actors and the result is a film that is tightly woven and beautifully executed entertainment.

There are many levels to the story - the dwindling impact of the printed American newspapers that are succumbing to the immediacy of the Internet, the demise of investigative journalism and the rise of 'hot stories' for the sake of selling newspapers as opposed to informing the public of important issues, the deep seated corruption in the government and the extent to which the government will go to cover up important yet politically delicate issues, and the loss of reporters who have a drive to investigate until the truth is uncovered.

Russell Crowe, far too fat and grungy for a healthy actor, is the reporter bent on finding the truth, Helen Mirren is the desperately driven editor at the threat of losing her job for lack of Inquirer-like stories to sell her paper, Rachel McAdams is the bright young but inexperienced reporter who learns the game from Crowe, Crowe's best friend Ben Affleck is the Congressman at the center of the latest governmental mess, Robin Wright Penn is Affleck's wife and Crowe's lover, and the plot twists and turns on the murder of an aide to Affleck who is not what she seemed to be.  But then none of the government types (Jeff Daniels), PR people (Jason Bateman), or others involved in the plot are clean.  The plot is well outlined by others but it would be unfair to go without commenting on the excellence of the cameos by Viola Davis as a pathologist, David Harbour as an informer, Henry Lennix as the detective, and Michael Berresse (best known as a Broadway musical comedy star) as the terrifying hit man.  Without depending on CGI effects, this is simply a stunning drama where the terror and thrills come from the performances by the actors (this may be Russell Crowe's finest role to date!).

Running for six consecutive weekends on Sunday nights here in the States, I felt adrift and bereft once the series was over.

Now, think about condensing 350 minutes of never-flagging material into a traditional two-hour film and you realize how much of the richness of the tale had to have been cast over the side.  One example:  James McAvoy - almost an unknown as the original aired - has a big, meaty part as a cub newspaper reporter.  In the mini-series, this character is the one who helps break the part of the story involving 'Dominic'.  In the US version McAvoy's character is a dude in a baseball cap who sits around the newsroom and gets a couple of lines.

Still, there are things to like about this movie: Russell Crowe is very believable as an investigative reporter; Rachel McAdams always picks and excels in quality projects (and that holds true here); Ben Affleck does good work as a Congressman; Helen Mirren is good (and good to look at - radiant here as always); and Robin Wright Penn is winning in her role as the scorned political spouse (lots of recent role models to choose from).

But in almost all those cases, the original British actor rocked the house with the role, mostly because they had so much darn material to work with.  In order, from the list I provided above, the originals were John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, David Morrissey, the great Bill Nighy, and Polly Walker.  Is the career of John Simm going to measure up to Russell Crowe's?  Probably not.  But John Simm is Cal McCaffery - he owns the role, as does Bill Nighy that of the newspaper editor in a way that Helen Mirren cannot...not because of any shortcoming on her part (she's the great Helen Mirren), but because she's simply not given enough to work with over two hours.

3709188,4,B001N2MWGO,"State of Play is a good thriller that combines mystery and suspense and pulls a big and credible surprise at the end.  Russel Crowe plays the old school newspaper reporter whose former roommate, best friend and now Congressman Ben Affleck finds himself in deep trouble after a series of negative events involving one of his staff.  Crowe and Affleck are excellent in their respective roles, the former providing another strong performance and the latter continuing to revive his career after his disastrous relationship with J-Lo.  The Congressman is in the middle of taking on the defense department's largest contractor (a fictional subsititute for the Blackwater Corporation) and their increasingly lucrative contracts.  This confrontation mirrors the current and real concerns about these expanding contracts and potentially illegal actions of these contractors.

Rachel McAdams overdoes her role a bit at first, as she plays the Washington Post's political blogger (and represents the new online media).  She is cocky and confident, and willing to post blogs with serious conclusions and repercussions based on relatively flimsy reporting.  Crowe, on the other hand, is old school and covers every nook and cranny and follows every lead before publishing a piece. As Crowe and McAdams join forces to tackle the ever more complicated intersection of Affleck's character and his investigation of the defense contractor, Crowe becomes McAdams' mentor and guide, showing her how to properly conduct investigative journalism.  At the end, old and new media triumph as they work cohesively together.  Who knows how much this reflects current or future reality.

The stereotypes come in the traits and behavior of Crowe as the old media rep (messy apartment; messy, long-haired look); McAdams as the new media rep (cocky and  overconfident);  Helen Mirren's character as the head of the Washington Post (stern yet compassionate, with her English accent thrown in to provide a sense of aristrocacy); Domininc Foy as the deranged killer/hitman (psychotic with no nuances).  In fact, Foy's character was more of a caricature than a stereotype.

In reality, PMFs survive more scrutiny and hold their employees to higher standards than the regular military due to the consequences of minor mistakes (Executive Outcomes/Sandline) and they do a large amount of good that will never be noticed.  The cheapest and most effective way to clean-up Darfur would be through the use of PMFs.  They could end genocide tomorrow.

I was laughing during the inquisition of the PMF CEO by Collins.  ""He exploits the lives of ex-military for his own financial gain"" (paraphrasing).  What a crock!  Those in the military have higher odds of killing themselves driving a motorcycle while off-duty stateside than PMF employees guarding crown princes in the sandbox.  Also, I wouldn't call it exploitation when they are being paid over $200,000/year.

I tried to make the switch from the USMC to Blackwater after returning from Iraq and being discharged.  With my service record, I thought they would love to have me - I never even got a call back.  They were too busy putting ex-special forces through their grueling indoctrination program.

It was released in 2009 with a plot that notes the 24 hour news cycle does not give time for true depth reporting.  All the facts need to be in before conclusions are reached.

State of Play begins with a thief running through Washington DC and a pizza delivery man being killed by a a man with a handgun and silencer.  The next day, a young, beautiful red-headed woman, Sonia Baker, is murdered in a Washington Subway.  Stephen Collins, an ambitious congressman (Ben Affleck) is in a hearing on PointCorp, and when he announces that Sonia Baker, his lead researcher just died, he seems distraught.  The scandal papers say he is having an affair with the victim.  Later, Collins confirms this is true.

Cal finds evidence this is not true, and the plot thickens.  Many more discoveries ensue, but when Cal finds that PointCorp, a defense contractor is set to win a $30-$40 billion contract he links key people to the plot.  Somehow after many twists and turns there is a surprise ending.  It is worth the wait.  This movie is great for suspense buff's.",1261958400,2,1382,4.7521008403361344
3709193,2,B001N2MWGO,"I am sorry to say that I was greatly disappointed with this movie. Going in, it seemed to have a lot of what I really enjoy in a movie -- political thriller-type intrigue, contemporary plot, and excellent cast. Even though I was disappointed after watching it, based upon my affinity for this genre I tried to convince myself that I liked it. But the truth is I have seen so many far superior political thrillers that this one bordered on boring. The plot was decent enough (with a few holes, as always), but I thought the filming technique, pace of the film, screenwriting and acting were definitely sub-par. I didn't really like anybody's acting in this except perhaps Jason Bateman's. Russell Crowe looked bad and was unconvincing, Ben Affleck was miserably unconvincing, Rachel McAdams was entirely miscast, Robin Wright Penn was her usual morose self, and even Helen Mirren's lines were delivered as if she felt uncomfortable saying them and knew she was in a mediocre film. All in all, the cast and script didn't get me interested--let alone excited--as to how it would turn out. The ""twist"" ending didn't leave me with a ""wow, that was unexpected!"" feeling; rather I found myself kind of yawning at the reveal. Compared to ""The Sum of All Fears,"" based on Tom Clancy's thriller in which Ben Affleck does at least a respectable acting job as Jack Ryan (but not nearly as good as Harrison Ford's portrayal of the Ryan character in, say, ""Patriot Games,"" etc.), this movie was yet another that made Ben Affleck look like he should have stuck to writing instead of acting.

The assembled cast of Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, and Helen Mirren put in strong performances that will satisfy many critics. I am one of the many who enjoyed the film even though the ending is somewhat predictable; but then again very few movies provide shocker endings these days.

As for the disc itself, although I would not put it up there with the top-tier reference quality discs like Up and No Country for Old Men (to name a few), it doesn't miss by much. Grain is kept to a minimum, colors are somewhat subdued but accurate due to the Director's vision of the movie. Overall, a fine transfer delivered on this disc by Universal. The sound quality is also very good considering the type of movie it is. With State of Play being a dialog driven movie rather than action packed, the DTS-HD MA transfer does not give your surround setup a major work out but does provide very crisp and easy to hear dialog. Ambient sounds such as the newspaper room and chatting office workers are audible yet do not overshadow the main dialog coming thru the center channel. LFE inputs show up a few times throughout the movie to provide some low end.

Russell Crowe plays a journalist, a kind of a dinosaur in this age of blogging, who is devoted to his job. His latest story involves the connection between the shooting of a pizza delivery guy and the suicide of a rising politicians aide who has thrown herself to death under a subway train. The dead woman it is learned has been having an affair with her married boss the senator, played by Ben Affleck who is friends with Russell Crowe.

Collins is in the mist of a scandal, a young, beautiful member of his staff (Sonia) appears to have died under mysterious circumstances, and it would seem he was having an illicit affair with her. McAffrey and his trusty sidekick/rising investigative journalist Della Frye (played by Rachel McAdams) are determined to get to the truth, but eventually find that Sonia's death may be related to the recent death of a drug dealer. What does this all REALLY mean? Will McAffrey's relationship with his friend (Collin's), or his lust for Collin's wife (played by Robin Wright Penn), cloud his judgment? Will he ""sacrifice his story"" for love or glory? Chalked full of countless scandals, political cover-ups and other twists and turns you are spellbound until McAffrey discovers the startling truth.

The rest of the cast works. The plot was well paced. The topic was timely. It brought in the demise of newspaper being replaced be online blogs. The atmosphere was very appropriate and the sets were good.

The problems were slight. The friendships were complex, but some of the history was overly complicated. Crowe's character at one time slept with his best friend's wife. This was an unnecessary complication I thought. The problem was the denouement. We had the big revelation and the case is solved, but the movie kept going. So we knew something else going on and it wasn't hard to guess who was involved. It was a slight let down.

I'm pretty confident from what I've heard and previous BBC to US film adaptations (Traffik) that the results would favor the quality of the BBC version.  Without a comparison to draw, I thought this movie was quite good and a well done suspense film.

On the positive side, I thought the performances by Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams and Helen Miren were all really solid.  My favorite perfomance was the 15 minutes of Jason Bateman as the slick, arrogant, empty suite PR guy.  The screenplay did a strong job of integrating the tension between old-media and new media, both the pressures facing the editorial side from the corporate owners along with the challenges faced by journalists in the quest for less depth pieces and more real time sound bites to compete with the 24 hour nature of the web.  Throughout the movie the tension between Crowe and Miren was palpable in their scenes together and permeated the feeling that existed in the newsroom.  Crowe and McAdams had very good chemistry -- Crowe, the wise and experienced journalist who hopelessly clings to an outdated and idealistic view of his ""calling"" while McAdams is the new breed of journalist, more opinionated and provocative to compete with the reality of 24 hour news cycles, blogs and talk radio.

On the negative side, Ben Affleck was mediocre and seemed to be going through the motions during much of his screen time.  I didn't find him credible as the former soldier turned up-and-coming Congressman.  Additionally, I found the relationship between Crowe and Robin Wright forced and not very additive to the plot.  When the news is breaks after the death of Sonia Parker and her relationship with Stephen Collins (Affleck) is revealed, how was it possible that his wife (Wright) could have made it out to a hotspot bar in DC without being hounded by the press -- especially after they were camped outside her home earlier that day.

Overall, I enjoyed ""State of Play"" for what it was.  It wasn't nearly as good as ""Michael Clayton"", ""Breach"" or ""The Insider"".  However, it provided for two solid hours of entertainment with a plausible plot line, some good star acting power and fast-paced action.",1259452800,,2253,4.863874345549738

The film is distinguished by top-notch direction, writing, and acting particularly Ben Affleck as a disgraced congressman.  I note Affleck becuase lately he's been making his mark not only in this film but in ""Hollywoodland"" where he was stupendous as the late actor George Reeves.

3709206,4,B001N2MWGO,"Perhaps I could have rated State of Play five stars if I hadn't seen the BBC miniseries.  As good as the movie is, it is limited by the medium and could only provide broad hints of the subplots that made the BBC series so rich and suspenseful.  However, this movie is a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours.

The cast is outstanding.  Russell Crowe is superb as the driven reporter who is personally involved in a story that threatens to destroy his Congressman friend, played by Ben Affleck.  Affleck is underrated as an actor; his portrayal of Stephen Collins is finely nuanced and convincing. Rachel McAdams is brave and naive as the ambitious cub reporter who longs to be taken seriously and Robin Wright Penn is nicely sympathtic as Collins' wronged and wronging wife.  Helen Mirren is forceful and profane as Cal's editor, though sometimes it seemed she didn't quite understand what an editor actually does.  Still, though it's possible to nit-pick--why would the writers have Collins openly weep at a Congressional hearing, for example--all these things are necessary to the plot, which is necessarily limited by time.  See above.

State of Play is great entertainment, and addresses the issue of what we have a right to expect from elected officials.  How sad it is that thirty years after All The President's Men, this continues to be an issue worth investing millions into a movie?",1257811200,2,1395,4.848101265822785
3709207,3,B001N2MWGO,"State of Play: 6 out of 10: State of Play is two hour plus big budget thriller without one memorable scene and only one memorable performance. The memorable performance is Helen Mirren who brightens up the screen whenever she appears. The rest of the performances are more stereotypes than individual characters.

Russell Crowe plays a reporter for a Washington Post stand-in. He looks and act like the stereotypical beat reporter. His best friend is Congressman Ben Affleck who is your standard movie congressional representative (Noble but battling demons.) He is caught in an affair with a now dead staffer and his best friend is on the case. Tagging along with Crowe is neophyte cub reporter Rachel McAdams who Jimmy Olsens it up despite the fact she is a lead blogger at a major national newspaper. Robin Wright Penn plays Affleck's cuckolded wife and seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast.

Mirren is the newspapers publisher and gets the films best lines, which she dishes, with aplomb. Everyone else seems to be playing along at half speed. For a thriller there is a strange lack of action or tension. The twists seemed preordained and the characters behave exactly as they are programmed.

The film certainly has star power and a big budget but it simply does not seem to know what to do with it. Part of the problem is that it is condensed from a 2003 British mini-series of the same name. Condensing the 300 minutes of plot into 120 or so minutes leaves little room for character development or nuance. The players seem to be quickly checking of plot boxes.

The films other big problem is that it is a overwrought love letter to the newspaper business, including groan worthy dialogue about the magnanimous printed fourth estate and an end title sequence that can only be described as porn for publishers.

3709208,2,B001N2MWGO,"This film was released in April 2009 and therefore was presumably filmed before Barack Obama assumed office as president. This timeline excuses (explained below), to a certain degree, the leftist paranoia on display in this film. Nevertheless, this film should offend level-headed viewers on many points:

First, Crowe plays a reporter in the Woodward and Bernstein mold for the Washington Globe, a fictional representation of the Washington Post. He and his editor are presented to the viewer as embodiments of street-savvy, truth-seekers, when of course, in reality, the truth about reporters and the Post is quite different.

Second, a sharp attack is leveled in this film against bloggers - they are people who ""up-chuck"" on the Internet -; bloggers are juxtaposed as fact-less mudslingers undermining the teetering-bastions of truth which are America's largest and most liberal newspapers. In the world I occupy, most of the truth I find is most definitely not in the mainstream media, but instead in alternate media, such as on blogs. Why do mainstream news publishers think they are losing readers like rats leaving a sinking ship if their readers actually think those publishers are their most reliable sources of truth?  This is left-wing paranoia/fantasy.

Third, hopefully it is evident to the filmmakers now, with President Obama now in control of General Motors, Chrysler, and numerous major financial institutions; with him and fellow Democrats trying to take over 1/6th of the U.S. economy (health-care), and hold 100% of the economy by the throat (cap and trade) that Americans have far more to fear from leftists, regarding government overreach, than they do from right-wingers, fantastically portrayed in this film as trying to establish a reign by Brownshirt's through contracting with organizations like Blackwater.

3709222,5,B001N2MWGO,"""State of Play"" is an intelligent thriller in which a journalist (Russell Crowe) must investigate a military-industrial complex conspiracy to destroy the reputation of his best friend, crusading Congressman (Ben Stiller).  The movie manages to interplay social commentary (the corporate villain Northpoint is modeled on Blackwater) with dramatic suspense, and finds a balance between the two that draws in the viewer so that the finale is powerful and memorable.

Behind all the politics and the drama is a simple familiar dynamic:  two college classmates, and the women torn between them.  Anne Collins (Robin Wright Penn) is in love with Cal McAffrey, but ends up marrying the more reliable and brave Stephen Collins.  It is this overwhelming constant conflict within this married woman that lets her slip into bed with the journalist, destroying the best friends' friendship and establishing the backdrop for the story.

""State of Play"" begins with the apparent random shooting of two men, and the apparent suicide of one woman, an aide and lover to Congressman Stephen Collins.  The shooting of the two men causes journalist Cal McAffrey to rush to the scene of the crime.  The aide's death causes a scandal:  during the Congressional inquiry into Northpoint's contracts with the government Congressman Collins breaks down in tears, and the media are relentless in their speculations and accusations.  It is the Congressman's late-night visit to his ex-best friend's apartment that connects two strands, and sets into motion a series of events that reveal a vast conspiracy at the heart of government.

The Hollywood hypocrisy of criticizing corporate hegemony (what is Hollywood except part of the corporate hegemony) that combines the arms of mercenaries, the power of politicians, and the influence of newsmen can be painful to watch - but ""State of Play"" is accurate and devastating in its portrayal of both the characters and the tense dynamic between them.  The journalist's boss Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) is cynical and tough but intelligent and loyal - she's torn between her superiors who pursue profit, and her journalists who pursue the truth.  The young journalist Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) is chirpy and annoying, but is redeemed by the sense of goodness still in her because of her youth and inexperience.

Ultimately, it's the dynamic between the two best friends that is the heart of the story, and here Russell Crowe shines again (playing the cynical and outraged hero is too easy for him) but even the stilted Ben Stiller delivers a good performance.

I understand that the BBC mini-series from which this movie was based is better, and I look forward to watching the mini-series as well.",1255478400,,2715,5.1807780320366135

Considering that I might have saved myself two hours, five bucks and several thousand calories, it's a shame I didn't come here BEFORE watching State of Play - after reading a sampling of the top reviews, I'm sure I'd have skipped this film.  Seriously, isn't it amusing that a plot about journalism generates so much error-ridden, grammar-abusing, typo-laden, comma-slinging copy?  This review page badly needs an editor. (oops)
/end rant/

In a film that can't decide between a half-dozen lead stories, Russell Crowe anchors it just enough to make it watchable.  His character's old-school approach to investigative journalism, especially as contrasted with the slick, wiz-bang appeal of online ""truthiness"", provides the only compelling storyline.  The remaining 9/10ths of the plot is borrowed from character Della Frye's news blogs - implausible, overwrought and lacking substance.  This film had great potential, but fails to deliver.

A couple of side notes: First, Jason Bateman shines as the sleezy PR operator; the film is almost worth watching just for that performance alone.  Second, anyone living in or near Washington D.C. will enjoy most of the outdoor scenes for the recognizable landmarks.

3709226,2,B001N2MWGO,"State of Play has received much attention for its spin on the plight of today's newspapers. The story pairs up a veteran journalist (Cal McAfferey, played by Russell Crowe with an odd accent) with a newbie blogger (Della Frye, played by Rachel McAdams).  The plot is technically about the death of Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer) who just happens to be working for Rep. Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) who just happens to be a former roommate of Cal.  It seems there's something rotten in the state department, or in this case the private military company they hire: PointCorp, an analog for Blackwater.

State of Play has two different agendas, one more overt than the other.  At its heart, the movie postulates what would happen if the U.S. military had largely surrendered its operations to freelance military operations that are not accountable to the American people. This is no theory. In fact, Blackwater received so much negative publicity that it changed its name to Xe. The supposed hue and cry that would be raised by this revelation didn't amount to much, deflating the entire premise of State of Play.

The other main theme is the tension between supposed cub reporters who only blog on the web and real journalists who aren't afraid to pick up the phone or make a deal.  Frye is a foil to make Cal look smart.  At no point do we see Frye actually blog or the consequences of her blogging, besides reporting on something Cal felt was private.  Or to put it another way: bloggers are self-serving, unethical morons who don't know how to report the facts.  The movie feels decidedly lopsided in favor of beat reporters. Oh sure, there's tension and drama and a few surprises along the way.  But Frye is completely unnecessary.

In the background is the looming threat of the newspaper being closed, but these occasional reminders (falling from the foul mouth of Helen Mirren, no less) feel forced. To assume one breaking story would save the newspaper is to fundamentally misunderstand the downfall of the newspaper industry.

State of Play was based on a 2003 BBC serial of the same name. And that's the problem. Too long and creaky in places, it feels like a movie drawn from subject matter that's six years out of date.",1255132800,7,2226,4.768229166666667

3709228,5,B001N2MWGO,"You are taken on quite a ride with 'State of Play' where Ben Affleck and Russell Crow play friends, Affleck a very involved Congressman and Crow a very active Journalist who seems on the last legs of a career with the paper he works for going more to the web.  His editor, who is attempting to squeeze every dollar out of the paper gets more and more delirious about McAffrey (Crow) as he tries to track down the truth behind a scandal involving congressman Collins (Affleck).

There are a few twists and you get a feel of the issues that the News Media faces with balancing getting the story, versus getting the truth.  (See the Book  'Losing the News').  Then you have a congressman who is overseeing the committee for reviewing a new national security consulting firm.  The plot thickens as McAffrey pulls back the layers of information using all of the sources he can dig up.  Great bit on investigative journalism.  I think it gives a little of a sense of what went on in the Watergate era with Deep Throat and Woodward and Burnstein.

The junior reporter/blogger Della Frye, played by Rachel McAdams, is vying for getting noticed in her career giving us a sense of play between Generation X and the quickly getting behind the times Baby Boom Generation.

You have a couple of interesting threads blending marvelously into one, issues of Government and corruption, Journalistic excellence and the current state of the News Print medium and internal generational differences.

This really makes for keeping you on the edge of your seat and having to really stay in tune with what is going on.  Interestingly, everyone is questioning everyone elses integrity throughout and you really feel for McAffrey when everyone questions his motives for his approach in digging and digging for the truth.

I'm not sure what some people have against Ben Affleck, but I thought he did a very good job as the congressman. Just when you think you know who did what, there is another curve ball.

3709233,4,B001N2MWGO,"I have over the years become a fan of Russell Crowe. He is simply put a very good actor. He has a big believability factor no matter what the time period of the role he is playing, and his performance in State of Play is no different.

The story in State of Play is a mostly smart well written story with good suspense that unfortunately dies off into a political diatribe by the end. The story makes bad guys out of the ""Military Contractor Industry ""Ben Affleck's character says ""We (the USA govt.) pay to train them and you get them killed"" or something like that. Politically, that was a big hot button last year, due to the fact that the ""contractors"" were making high pay to do the things that our relatively small Volunteer Military are logistically prevented from doing. But consider this on that argument, our former fighter pilots, make a lot more money to fly commercial planes that they do to fight dog fights, and I always want to be on a plane with a former fighter pilot at the helm. So if we hire a former Navy Seal to train a fighting force shouldn't that be worth a high value? Think of what we pay a typical college football coach to lead young men into sports battle where no one should ever get killed, and compare that to the ""outrageous"" money that these ""mercenaries"" are being paid to risk their lives, and it doesn't sound ridiculous to me, and it is a much better option than returning to the draft to fill those positions. But that might just be me...
On the good side of the story, there is a pretty good murder mystery, some romantic intrigue, and one of the best newspaper plots to come along in a while and that preaching (that the press needs to be preserved even today) was a plot worth discussing.

So all in all, not a bad movie with some political propaganda, as well as some food for thought.

3709234,5,B001N2MWGO,"Take an excellent cast, a smart director and an accomplished screen writer, throw them into a room and let them go at it and you'd swear you'll walk away with a masterpiece, right.  Well, a masterpiece `State of Play' is not, but what it is is a very, very good movie; a great movie even.  With noteworthy performances, a tightly woven plot and engaging camera work that keeps us glued throughout, `State of Play' did more than just hold my attention; it grabbed it and flung it across the room.

I knew I was going to see this movie before I knew anything about it; I am that devoted to Russell Crowe.  Then I read that it was a remake of a BBC min-series.  I still have as of yet to see that, but I will now that I've seen this film.

I don't want to spoil too much of the movie, since Tony Gilroy worked real hard to make this an engaging and exciting thrill ride with twists and turns that are not predictable (even if you think they are).  All I'll say is that it starts with a murder, and then a presumed suicide.  Reporter Cal McAffrey is working on the murders, while blog reporter Della Frye is working on the suicide.  The suicide happens to be of a woman who worked for Congressman Stephen Collins, an old college buddy of Cal's.  When Cal starts to look into the young woman's death he unveils that the murder he is working on and this `suicide' seem to be related; but it goes much deeper than that.

Like I said, I really don't want to give too much away.

The acting here is spot on across the board.  Crowe is always a reliable source for quality entertainment, and he doesn't disappoint here.  He also doesn't out act his co-stars (which wouldn't be hard for him to do when matched with McAdams or Affleck), so the film never seems uneven.  This isn't to say that he drops the ball, for he is always in character and acting his tail off (just watch the way he processes information, that look on his face), but he knows the type of film he's in and the type of performance needed to sell this.

A pleasant surprise is the fact that some actors who are less than brilliant really up their game here and deliver wonderfully.

 Ben Affleck shocked me with his ability to really `act', something I've rarely, if ever, seen him do.  Rachel McAdams is one of the most beautiful women on the planet (seriously) and she has shown much potential in her career.  She doesn't blow anything out of the box here, but she is consistent and believable.  Helen Mirren is a firecracker and steals her every scene.  Robin Wright Penn is touching and moving, yet forgettable.  Jeff Daniels was a nice touch, and his final confrontation with Crowe was stellar (""SON!"").  For me though, this movie belongs to Jason Bateman, an actor I am not very familiar with who just blazes the screen in his few short scenes.  He is witty, charming (in a very creepy sort of way) and wholly believable.  I just wish they had written him into a few more scenes.

Like I said, this is not a masterpiece, but it is an enthralling and captivating political thriller that makes good use of its cast and its timeframe, injecting a rapid fire pace that keeps us glued to the screen, never wavering for a second or losing our interest long enough for us to get confused or give up.",1254096000,3,3256,4.374376039933444
3709235,5,B001N2MWGO,"I love these types of thrillers, especially when they're done well. In this case, it was very well done.

Russell Crowe did an outstanding job as the ragged old-school reporter and Helen Mirren was great as his cranky boss. That young girl sidekick, Rachel McAdams also did an outstanding job.

Ben Affleck was great too, well... as Ben Affleck playing a congressman. He's kind of a one-dimensional character actor, kind of like Keanu Reeves. However, I like his one character and love him in everything I've ever seen him do.

Robin Wright was also excellent as the put-upon congressman's wife.

There were plenty of twists and turns and I was surprised at the ending, which in this case, was a good thing. I also like the way it ended.

There's also some conflict thrown in between blogging and traditional journalism, which is very much a topic of discussion these days. The main story however, is basically a political thriller revolving around a series of murders. It's somewhat funny to see Ben Affleck in any serious role - I kept expecting him to burst onto the scene in a superhero constume - but he does a semi-decent job.

Russell Crowe is very believable as an old school reporter, with contacts everywhere in the city. The interactions between him and Rachel McAdams and Helen Mirren also seem very real. Overall, it was a good 2 hours of evening entertainment.",1253923200,,734,4.967479674796748
3709237,4,B001N2MWGO,"""State of Play"", an Americanized version of the hit BBC miniseries, may feel like familiar ground for fans of ""All the President's Men"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", and other thrillers set within the corridors of power, and Kevin Macdonald (the inventive director of ""The Last King of Scotland"") intentionally homaged ""President's Men"" frequently in the film (as both films involved conspiracy, investigative reporters and city newspapers). The references certainly don't hurt the film, although I wish he'd captured the mounting suspense as effectively! While well-crafted, ""State of Play"" never achieves 'edge-of-your-seat' tension, despite a first-rate cast, and clever script.

When a rising politician (Ben Affleck), heading a Senate subcommitte investigating a shady military subcontractor, discovers his mistress has died, he loses his composure in front of a national TV audience, and his political future is endangered. Was it an accident, a suicide...or murder? He asks his ex-college roommate, veteran reporter Russell Crowe (who looks about a decade older than Affleck!), to look into it. Hounded by young, up-and-coming reporter Rachel McAdams, Crowe half-heartedly begins to investigate the death...and a much, much larger plot emerges, involving the corporation under investigation, the Senate Majority Leader (Jeff Daniels), possibly Affleck's unhappy wife (and ex-Crowe girlfriend), Robin Wright Penn, and even Affleck, himself. While Crowe's exasperated editor (Helen Mirren) fights him, demanding to go to press with what he has, Crowe refuses to stop, until he knows the truth...making him a target...

Washington, D.C. has never been seen to better advantage, and the press room is so accurate, it's difficult to believe it's actually a movie set. Russell Crowe is magnificent, certainly giving the best performance of the film (Affleck, McAdams, and Mirren are also very good). The climactic plot twist, while not entirely a surprise, is satisfying...but without the 'mounting suspense' element, there are moments when the story drags a bit.

The casting was on target overall, with one exception:  Ben Affleck.  His congressman character was supposed to have been a college roommate of Russell Crowe's character, which was hard to believe as Affleck looks about 10 years younger.  Robin Wright Penn played the congressman's wife, & again, it's easier to picture Crowe's & Penn's characters in the same age/peer group & Affleck seemed the odd one out.

It's not even his acting abilities, but he simply does not have the gravitas to be believable as a political player in Washington, nor did he look or sound like one.  To me, he was the weak point of an otherwise very enjoyable political thriller.",1253491200,2,1066,4.724324324324324

(1.) Do not see this movie until you've seen the far superior BBC 2003 miniseries (also on DVD). Many feel, including some staff of this movie, to be one of the best TV thrillers ever produced.
(2.) A well conceived Americanized version in which the governments use of private ex-military personnel and lobbyists, ostensibly to promote the American concept of freedom, but more accurately it's an exercise in economics or how to get rich quick.
Negatives:
(1.) Miscasting both in terms of the skill of the actors to become believable journalists, politicians and other professionals,  and stereocasting as exemplified by an aggressive novice female reporter; an unkempt lead reporter; a couple of blacks playing unfortunately stereotypic roles; an obligatory ex-Bond British female matriarch boss; dumb police; sly politicians.
(2.) Stereotypic both for the newspaper and background, e.g. reporter strolls through newsroom with harried staff jumping up for attention; unkempt respected lead reporter with unkempt apartment with unkempt office; scenes with helicopters (served no purpose in the story) underground public garages and hotel rooms - all crutches used too many times in movies of this type.
(3.) Poor directing with scene jumping and disjointed transitions that left you feeling deprived of connection with the story and it's people. No flow and too superficial. Notice I didn't say characters because there was plenty of, and all too apparent, artificial characterization.
(4.) Poor script writing in this Americanized dumbed down version best illustrated by the fact that they had to over rely on music to create suspense and tension;  as well as trying to be contemporary American chic with iPhones, blogs, Blackwater (XE) and  contemporary TV newscasters. Alas, the movie was made before tweets were hot.",1252627200,14,1831,5.440140845070423
3709250,3,B001N2MWGO,"`State of Play' is based on a BBC Television production of the same name. It is a political thriller set in Washington D.C. with the frantic edginess of `All The President's Men'. There is even a suspense filled scene set in an underground parking garage. The Watergate Complex also makes a brief appearance. Perhaps, homage to Alan J. Pakula. Much of the film is shot in a vast, open newsroom. One simply cannot watch the film without thinking of the changes going on in real newsrooms. This is a credit to Director Kevin MacDonald, who paced the action well and made full use of the set.

The plot revolves around the collision of two reporters, one old media, and the other new. Russell Crowe is the grizzled veteran, Cal. His style is hitting the streets and sniffing out the leads and sources that will break the story. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, Internet savvy and on the rise. When she enters Cal's world to assist with a big story, she is reminded that her status is that of a Cub Reporter. The source of it, the Ben Bradlee-ish publisher, Helen Mirren. Ms. Mirren adds a nice, whiskey in the morning bent to the cast.

Crowe is superb. His portrayal of `Cal McAffrey' is intense, methodical, and steady. When the action kicks into high gear, Crowe's pace does as well. At times, he reminds me a bit of the immortal `Aqualung' depicted on the cover of the Jethro Tull LP. It may be an obscure reference, but I insisted it remain. He is secure enough in his talent, to allow the other actor's, mainly McAdams, Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn to, on occasion, talk down to his character while he painfully winces, almost in acknowledgment. Lesser actors would never allow this to make the final script. It's another reason why Crowe is among the very best.

Affleck gives a strong portrayal of a Congressman who gets caught up in the scandals that can easily be lifted from the headlines of many a Washington Post morning edition. The reminder that the plot is plausible makes a statement unto itself. Robin Wright Penn is effective as Affleck's weary wife. While her part was more complex than most involving `the wife', it could have been a bit healthier.

Rounding out the cast is a nice mix of talent. Jason Bateman in a superbly played role as a source in the investigation, Jeff Daniels, as the Congressional majority whip, Michael Berresse as the loner ex-soldier , Harry Lennex, great as usual, this time as the vexed police detective. Josh Mostel and Michael Weston also deliver nice chemistry as Crowe's in the field tech specialists.

I also liked the appearance of Sarah Lord as `Mandi Brokaw', the street hustling addict who has a break to offer Crowe in his investigation. She speaks volumes in her initial non-verbal scene, with her expression. Her style is intriguing, and I'd enjoy seeing her in a larger role, perhaps in the future.

The newspaper industry may be the last sign of an era that is phasing out. Papers are ubiquitous. They occupy a place on every corner of every major city in the world. Sadly, this is ending. But not before being documented in solid movies like this. Make sure to watch the end credits, as it takes a final look at the process of putting out a newspaper edition. `State of Play' is one of the movies that will be remembered, in part, for portraying a much-loved industry.

The disc was viewed on a highly rated brand name, 40"", 120Hz, 1080P set.  The DVD player is also a highly rated brand name, Blu-ray set. The quality of the picture was excellent, and sound superb (5.1 DTS Digital Surround). Extras include deleted scenes, a 'Making Of' featurette.  The U-Control option is available for interactive features while viewing the film.",1252540800,3,3699,4.678461538461539
3709251,3,B001N2MWGO,"State of Play is an interesting political thriller but I was kind of left disappointed. The story is somewhat boring and flat - but this film is better than some of the turkeys I have seen this year. The cast is stellar - minus Ben Affleck, he can't act his way out of a paper bag. Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright-Penn, and Helen Mirren always bring their A-game. I wish I liked this film better, it's a mixed bag for me.",1252454400,3,433,4.2926829268292686
3709252,4,B001N2MWGO,"""State of Play"" is a complex whodunnit set against a backdrop of political intrigue in Washington DC.  There are crosses and double crosses that keep the viewer interested until the very end.  This is a good sign for a film of this genre.

Yet, for all its virtues, ""State of Play"" manages to fall short of the mark.  My suspicion is that it was simply trying to cram too much detail into a two hour film.  Perhaps it would have been better in its previous incarnation as a mini-series.  In this way, the various threads could have been tied together more carefully.  In the film, the viewer is compelled to play close attention.  One missed detail could easily create confusion.

As to the acting, Russell Crowe again steals the show.  Crowe is the complete actor.  No matter what the role, he always manages to rise to the occasion.  Here, he plays the role of an old fashioned, crumpled newspaper man.  He is overweight, unkempt and so very plausible.  He is supported by some fine acting by Ben Affleck as a congressman of questionable motives, Rachel McAdams as the young newspaper blogger and Helen Mirren as the paper's editor.  Mirren seems to get better with age.  Yet, it is Crowe who is truly larger than life.

While I enjoyed this film, I am unable to recommend it with anything more than four stars.  Go and see it, enjoy it as a good murder mystery but don't expect to leave the cinema with a sense that you have seen anything absolutely remarkable.",1252368000,3,1464,4.565384615384615
3709253,4,B001N2MWGO,"This movie is rife with suspense and textured with the intertwining worlds of Washington politics, crime journalism, and murder.  It is splendidly cast with Russell Crowe as the rumpled maverick reporter cum detective, whose cluttered cubicle and slovenly appearance suggest a genius at work, one who cares little about what anyone thinks of him and never takes his eyes off the ball.  Rachel McAdams is excellent as a cub reporter who learns the ropes under his tutelage, and Helen Mirren is the brash editor who roars commandingly at her staff as the deadline approaches and then passes.

The movie starts out with the murder of a politician's (played by Ben Affleck) mistress, and as it twists and turns, the real story behind the murder gradually emerges as pieces of evidence provided by first one and then another source begin to fit together like pieces of a puzzle.  The viewer guessing who murdered Sonia and why may have a change of mind more than once during the course of the movie as new facts keep coming out and altering the viewer's assumptions.  The sets and shooting locations are quite realistic, and this adds an extra element of verisimilitude.

Affleck does a creditable job in his role, but I did not find him compelling, possibly because of the way his role was written; I believe the writers were attempting to show many sides of his character to keep the viewer guessing, and this diluted the power and focus that his role might otherwise have had.  Jason Bateman in his brief appearance, though, was very convincing and capably evoked both humor and pathos.

The movie approaches a can't-take-my-eyes-off-it fascination as it evolves, with the gripping suspense and action that go with that.  Most of the characters show at least glimpses of their human side, relieving them of the risk of becoming caricatures.  There's good chemistry between Crowe and McAdams which thankfully never takes them to the inevitable bedroom scene.  Despite escaping that cliche, though, it does have a bit more violence than I would expect in a PG-13 movie.  Although the viewer is spared the sight of Sonia being murdered, other murders take place right before his eyes, and quite graphically.  I agree that it is not as graphic as many R-rated movies and the volume of violent scenes is lowe, but it isn't a typical PG-13 movie either, so I would not consider it suitable for children or young teens at all.  It should be in an in-between category of its own.

In the last analysis, it's clear that a lot of work and artistry went into the movie to create mood and suspense, and Crowe's performance is stellar.  Even so, it's a movie that I probably won't watch again. The violence is more than I want to see, and while we see enough of Crowe's genius to find him mesmerizing, we don't see into his character enough to find out who he really is.  Yes, the character is brilliant, but he is still an enigma at the end.  I gave the movie 4 stars, and it solidly earned about four and a half.  To get the other half a star, though, I wanted more insight into the characters and a bit of humor in places to lighten it up.  The graphic violence was not necessary, and I don't like it.  I must say, though, that I've been underestimating Crowe's talent up until now.  I finally recognize that he is one of the great contemporary actors.",1252195200,,3340,4.683219178082192
3709254,3,B001N2MWGO,"I really wanted to like this film.  The premise is interesting and somewhat timely.  The allusions to Blackwater contracts are a current issue today, especially in the wake of recent findings on torture.  But somehow this movie dances around those issues and ekes out more time on the Washington sex sleaze that we see time and again.  It's almost as if the filmmaker wanted to do more but was somehow restrained, which is a plot of the film itself.  Crowe is solid as usual but Ben Affleck is wooden, and he has lots of screen time for someone with... let's face it everyone; Ben is a nice guy but has limited acting chops.  Worth seeing but beware, you might not be as suspended as you think you will be.",1252195200,6,706,4.434108527131783
3709255,4,B001N2MWGO,"I admit I have never watched the BBC miniseries upon which State of Play is loosely based, but for a feature-length movie, this is not bad at all. A sort of conspiracy/political thriller, State of Play stars the talented Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, and Jeff Bridges. Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, a veteran long-haired, rather chubby [but still looks great!] journalist with The Washington Globe, working under hard-nosed boss Cameron Lynne [Helen Mirren]. He is obviously really good at his job, but does have to contend with advances in technology and in particular, an eager beaver cub reporter/blogger Della Frye [Rachel McAdams]. When Cal is assigned to investigate a murder that seems to be drug motivated, he finds another case landing on his plate - the apparent suicide of a political aide, who also happened to be the mistress of his ex-college roommate, Congressman Stephen Collins [Ben Affleck] who is married to Anne Collins [Robin Wright Penn].

Soon, Cal and Della find themselves embroiled in a conspiracy that has to do with a private security corporation, and the pair's investigations uncover some very startling revelations. The story moves along at a quick pace, and just as I thought I had it all figured out, a couple of twists in the plot had me rethinking the story arcs. Credibly-acted, this movie has it all - assured direction, intelligent plot, and plenty of plot twists and action to satisfy those who are fans of the political/conspiracy/thriller genres.",1252195200,2,1530,5.095617529880478
3709256,5,B001N2MWGO,"This is the first 2009 film release I have wanted to buy.

Bought it because I have been a fan of Russell's.

He did a great job with the character.  Personal note, character first name is my father name is my fathers name.  Wore blue shirts so same favorite color as my father.

Interesting story to follow.  Just when you think you have the what is going on figured out it surprises you.

Helen did a good job even though her character basically just did 1 thing, get mad, say the new owners ONLY were interested in making money .

Now, you could see on the screen both Russell & Helen were perfect for their role, A list past Oscar winning actors.

Now, as we go.  Affleck.  Oscar winner but not for acting.  He was ONLY passable IN THE ROLE OF THE Congressman.  This role should have been given to another A list actor.

Robin, who starred in 1 of Russell's favorite films The Princess Bride you barely saw her & she could have phoned the role in, she slept walked through it.

It was disappointing this film did not do well at the box office.  It should have.

As for the DVD.  Nothing special about it.  The HBO Making Of special & only 2 deleted scenes.

Yes, I know the film did not do well at the box office but it deserved a better DVD package.",1252195200,,1254,4.210970464135021

I go into the video store week after week and walk out with nothing. The standard fare is so disappointing. In fact, it is rare to get a movie that is really good. This one was really GREAT! It is one of those you can watch again and again. It may be a little to cerebral for some, but, for them, there is plenty of ""saw"" type junk.

3709260,3,B001N2MWGO,"Based on the BBC mini-series, director Kevin McDonald's ""STATE OF PLAY"" blends the two most reliable, favorite ingredients of an effective thriller; a political-conspiracy thriller mixed in with a journalism drama with a touch of a murder mystery mixed in. The film's direction can be taut, clean and energetic that plays on the moralities of politics and the responsibility of credible reporting. Kevin McDonald maneuvers the film's script in a meaty web of intrigue and suspense that is nicely acted and honest in its execution.

Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a seasoned reporter working at a struggling newspaper called ""The Washington Globe"". When the research assistant (played by Maria Thayer) and lover to a congressman named Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is killed, her mysterious death provokes a lot of speculation for a high-profile story. Cal has a history with Collins and his wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn), so he is the natural pick to tackle this story. But Cal becomes conflicted with what story he wants to tell the longer he digs for the truth; which leads him to team up with a young inexperienced reporter named Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) to sort out the mystery full of political intrigue to avoid further bloodshed and uncover the real story behind all the rumors and deceptions. Cal now finds himself face to face with his own `crisis of conscience' as his own proven investigative skills may not coincide with the needs for profit and that the real story may alienate his own friends.

""State of Play"" is a thriller that tries to keep its toes by mixing in elements of a political thriller that touches on some real world events after the tragedy of 9/11 and the responsibilities of credible fact-finding. The script by Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton), Matthew Carnahan (The Kingdom) and Billy Ray has its share of good dialogue delivered by characters that has some layers and dimensions that proved interesting. Cal represents the old-school style of reporting; he checks his facts, looks for credible sources and ignores the unnecessary hidden stories. His dislike on young inexperienced blogger Della comes absolutely natural. Cal sees her as the spoiled reporter who may write appealing articles who happen to have a better computer and a better office. The two are representations of the signs of the times and the internet phenomenon. It was also nice to see the script avoid the trappings of a perfunctory romance between the two reporters but instead director McDonald uses a sort of a mentor-student type of relationship between the two after they realize that they are both after the same thing.

The film's political side comes from the character of Stephen Collins who may have the best interests of the country at heart, although he made some mistakes on some decisions such as bedding his own research assistant. The screenplay is a little cautious, but it does point an accusing finger at certain corporations who make huge profit from a war. Apparently the privatization of soldiers in the war against terror is one profitable industry, and these soldiers are just mercenaries answerable to no one. The moral responsibilities of fighting a war are touched upon as well as maintaining the image of a clean public figure. Smear campaigns, damaging rumors and speculations are used to manipulate Congress to satisfy the needs of big corporate America.

Director McDonald does get the atmosphere and the fast-paced feel of a newspaper right. I liked the old-school `press room' with the editor looking above the reporters. McDonald is to be commended that he remembered to bring such late night hurdles into exposition; although frankly, the stereotypical character of Cal's editor in the person of Helen Mirren should've been abandoned. Mirren does a good performance as Cal's impatient and overly cautious editor, but her character has been overused in other films in this genre. The shady, corrupt politician in the person of Jeff Daniels has also been done to death. I also have issues with the age factor between Cal and Collins; Affleck and Crowe just don't fit as former college buddies. Affleck is decent as the congressman but Crowe just looked so much older than him, I couldn't really buy into the idea that they're the same age. The relationship between Cal and Anne isn't really brought into fruition; quite frankly, it felt a little forced to add some spice to the screenplay.

The manner of which the plot unravels is full of various storylines that come to a satisfying ending but some elements feel unnecessary. The script should have been more compact and some scenes dragged a little bit. It doesn't really hurt the film but Jason Bateman's scenes should have been more efficiently played out. It also seemed to try too hard on satisfying its audience in both the cerebral conspiracy thriller fan base and the action junkies; it does work on some levels but I thought the script may have had the fear of becoming too talkie that it needed to bring some gunplay into the mix. Some of the scenes just didn't match the film's tone at times.

""State of Play"" does have some nice touches such as an old-fashioned workhorse in the face of ""blogger-space"", it explores the morals of profit gain and the responsibilities of public officials; the problem is, sometimes, it just felt that the film didn't have confidence enough to stay within the realms of a journalistic drama. It tries to be too complex just for the sake of becoming complex, that it felt like it threw too many ideas that slowed the film's pace. It does feel predictable in the middle of the film, but I did appreciate the effort in delivering a credible thriller. It does deliver the goods and the effective revelations do hit the right spots.

Recommended! [3  Stars]

Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The picture looks pristine even when the colors looked a little restrained. The quality of the picture matches the film's tone. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is clear enough and well channeled.",1251849600,55,6026,4.9643211100099105
3709261,1,B001N2MWGO,"The BBC's mini series, State of Play, on which the American version was, well, sort of, based, is so far superior, it paralyzes the mind. With so many fine actors in the U.S. version, how the director, Kevin MacDonald, managed to get such sorry performances is beyond belief.

One thing this 2009 movie (ever wonder why it's already on DVD and Pay TV?) has that's useful: It will put an insomniac to sleep in ten minutes.

On the other hand, the BBC version is exciting, taut, suspenseful, and the casting is superb, with Bill Nigh in the original role of newspaper editor (given to Helen Mirren in the American version. For once, she is not perfect).

Trust me and spend the extra few bucks to buy the BBC version on Amazon.com.",1251849600,12,729,4.549618320610687

3709265,4,B001N2MWGO,"Based on the 2003 BBC series, the Americanized State of Play is an engaging, intelligent, and above all else impeccably acted thriller that delivers the goods.  Russell Crowe stars as veteran reporter Cal McAffrey, who uncovers a hidden plot involving his old college pal and current congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) upon the murder of his mistress.  Working alonside Cal is junior reporter Della (Rachel McAdams), and the two of which end up making some huge discoveries that could put both their lives in jeopardy.  Thanks to the sharp direction from Last King of Scotland director Andrew Macdonald and a twisting and intelligent screenplay, State of Play ends up being a satisfying thriller and drama on its own merits, and nicely condences the entire BBC series into one two hour film.  The cast however is the true standout of the film, with Crowe, Affleck, and McAdams delivering some wonderful performances.  Not to mention that the rest of the cast, including Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, and Viola Davis, isn't too shabby either.  All in all, regardless of whether or not you are familiar with the original BBC series, this American take on State of Play is wholeheartedly worth your time, especially if you're looking for a drama/thriller that definitely takes substance over style.",1251763200,5,1334,5.124423963133641

The plot is taut, relevant, and suspenseful. We know the company the film really refers to.

There's also great cast. Hard to go wrong, but it did.

You would have thought that with all the sophisticated test screening, market research ... etc. to protect their investments, the people who made this film could come up a with a better ending comparable to something like Michael Clayton. But they didn't.

Either the research company the producers hired was testing the film at a wrong audience, or the real event this film is based on has still not fully run its course.

One way or the other, the producers should fire the market research company that tells them the film will do well.
