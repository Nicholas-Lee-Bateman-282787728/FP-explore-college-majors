Thank you for the quick turn-around in delivery of this DVD.  I will definitely do business with you again.  And also thank you, Amazon.com!!!

8183596,4,B000O785W4,"It's an emotional shocker of a film based on a true child sex abuse case. Some details of the event were unnecessarily drawn out, which kept the movie from getting five stars from me. Since there is no plot synopsis, here is a summary of the movie.
*A single mother allowed her son to spend time with a Christian camp counselor unaware that the man had a prior conviction for child molestation. When charges are pressed, the boy is forced to face the pedophile in court who continues to mentally toy with the young boy. In exasperation, the mother kills her son's attacker in front of a packed courtroom.
*Is she justified in doing so or is she out for vengeance? The film did an adequate job of detailing the case from the onset to the sentencing of the mother. The probation officer reported that the mother lacked any remorse for her actions, which resulted in prison time. It appeared that, not only was the boy victimized by the molester, I felt that he was being used by the mother to keep herself out of doing time in prison. Unfortunately, during the mother's incarceration, the boy was sent to a juvenile detention facility until she was released from prison. A sad story!!
*CAUTION: Someone has tagged this movie as having nude children, which I did not see. It's also absurd to label the film as satanic, holocaust, and cult in nature.",1210204800,14,1346,4.589211618257261
