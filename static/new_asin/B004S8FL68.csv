8439582,1,B004S8FL68,"With the name of ""Red Reign"" and a 2011 release date for the 20th Anniversary of the Bulls first championship, I was excited to pick up this new DVD.  What I got was ""Learning to Fly,"" the first Bulls Championship video that was released 20 years ago.  It has not been remastered in any way, in fact it has blurry lines on the bottom of the screen from the VHS transfer.  If you have the ""Bulls Dynasty Series DVD Set,"" then you already have this exact video.  Except on the Dynasty version, the picture quality was better.  The only difference on ""Red Reign"" is you get one special feature - a poorly edited, amateurish interview with John Paxon and Scottie Pippen.  Where are the other players from that 91 Bulls team?  Or perhaps a game or at least a quarter from the series?  This was a huge disappointment.  For true Bulls fans, buy the Dynasty package or the Ultimate Jordan set.",1307232000,14,885,4.447204968944099
