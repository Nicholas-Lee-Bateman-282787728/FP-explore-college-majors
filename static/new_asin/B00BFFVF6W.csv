8567730,5,B00BFFVF6W,"I am always on the lookout for good, inspiring dvd's to watch with my family. The 'It's Your Life  The Moss Family,' dvd was a blessing to my family. It's always nice to see other families who love the Lord and live their life in a way that doesn't just merely say it, but also shows it. Watching how their daughter dealt with her accident and outcome had my daughters in awe. Even my husband enjoyed watching this and that says something. Of course it could be that the Moss's live in TN and we're southerners ourselves.",1375747200,2,521,4.371134020618556

8567732,5,B00BFFVF6W,"It Is Your Life: The Moody Family, is our newest favorite from Moore Family Films. Very well made, and wonderfully professional, we are happy to have gotten to know and be inspired by such a Godly family.

This video shows the dedication of raising a family who fears the Lord, and seeks to glorify Him, focusing on fathers leading the home, the children being obedient and following their parents, and creating family intimacy rather than the world's individualism. Seeing a family who is seeking God's will, even when it goes against the grain (even in modern Christianity) is truly a much needed thing in today's society, and one that is inspiring.

The children LOVE each other. They WANT to be together, helping and nurturing each other. They want to honor God (and their parents) with all their hearts, instilled into them by the sound teachings of their parents. We were happy to see such a no compromise approach to what is right. Their goal is to obey God and follow His word and goals. The boys and girls know their God appointed roles, they seek to make themselves disciples of Christ, they live to glorify God, not to please self, and not to love the world and the things of the world.

Using strong and solid arguments to back up God's ways, they happily promote the joys and blessings of having large families and allowing God to plan family size. They trust in God and rely on his wisdom rather than human wisdom, a sad fact that even today's church has lost. They do not apologize for standing firm on things such as homeschooling being the right way, teaching their children to be responsible and bless others, hard work, homesteading and not relying on others, not wasting time on entertainment, and other important life aspects.

This video hits home and several issues of obedience to God that modern Christianity refuses to come to terms with; A nearly flawless balance of how Christianity is demonstrated by a family. It offers subtle rebukes of this generation, such as how they fail to care and honor the elderly. They are prime examples of selfless living for others. The Moody family holds up the unpopular Biblical standard in the face of a culture that honors God with their lips, but their hearts and actions are of the contrary. We cannot praise nor thank the Moore family enough for sharing such a beautiful and much needed message.",1362355200,7,2363,4.728155339805825
