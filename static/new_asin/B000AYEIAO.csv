8080776,1,B000AYEIAO,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This Nutcracker Ballet is awful!  I have seen many productions live, on stage...the San Francisco Ballet Company and the Minnesota Ballet Theatre productions.  This one would have you believe there is something going on between the mother and Drosselmeyer.  I couldn't even watch it all the way through.  I must say though, the dancing is good, but the premise is not good.  There is no Clara/Marie, just a young boy.  The rest of the ballets are all right.  The Romeo and Juliet Ballet is in modern times, like West Side Story.  The music is outstanding!  Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake are good productions. But, you can buy them separately which is what I should have done.",1419552000,,718,4.908333333333333
