8553846,5,B00AMHFPUG,"Movie was made for under $5000 with money earned from a female bikini mud wrestling event.  Based on that you go in not expecting much and as all low budget films there are a couple of spots where the sound is off a bit or the lighting not perfect but if you get through the first 20 minutes the end is non stop adventure full of surprises and great camera shots and characters you just cannot miss.  This is a film you watch more than once which might be when I lend it out I never get it back.  So bought another copy today.  Just wish the price would go down a bit.  Oh well, it is worth it.",1390348800,,594,3.957983193277311
8553847,4,B00AMHFPUG,"A very suspenseful movie...and pretty dark, too. It's a little random with the supernatural monsters & all, but it makes sense in the context of the story & adds a very original flavor.",1374969600,,185,4.636363636363637
8553848,5,B00AMHFPUG,The Virgin Murders is a really great example of a high quality movie that was probably made with a minimal budget. That to me makes a movie even cooler.,1374710400,,152,4.275862068965517
8553849,4,B00AMHFPUG,"I wouldn't exactly call ""The Virgin Murders"" a ""horror"" film - at least not in the technical sense of what such films are nowadays. It's more of a psychological thriller - with just a pinch of the supernatural thrown in to add a little spice. And while it's a bit lacking in its production values (it was, after all, shot on a shoestring budget in Arizona), its portrayal of its protagonist's slow and agonizing downward spiral - with solid performances from both the lead and supporting casts - more than makes up for it. All in all, a very promising debut from director Tina Randolph McCulloch!",1363564800,3,596,4.632075471698113
8553850,4,B00AMHFPUG,This film is definitely not your average horror flick. Lots of twists and surprises to be sure. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I will rewatch this one.,1362528000,2,152,4.1
