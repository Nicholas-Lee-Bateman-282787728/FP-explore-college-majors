8391807,5,B0000D8UBB,"I was pleasantly surprised with the valuable content Adam ""Pitt Bull"" Hutchins offers in his Mixed Martial Arts ""Dirty Street Fighting"" DVD instructionals. Having bought his complete 5 DVD set it has proven to be well worth the money. Each tape covers in good detail all aspects of street fighting from striking to takedowns and groundfighting submissions. This Volume 5 is my favorite because it shows how to hit your attacker with really penetrating kick-punch combinations that give you the opportunity to move in with a takedown so you can finish off your opponrnrt with a submission hold. This is really a great series not only for people wanting to defend themselves but also for skilled fighters looking to improve their no-holds-barred fighting techniques. Definetly good material to have.",1076889600,7,797,5.186046511627907
