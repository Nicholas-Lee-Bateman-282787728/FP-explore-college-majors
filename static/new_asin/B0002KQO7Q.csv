2100641,4,B0002KQO7Q,"I actually stumbled on this little gem when it was playing in theaters here and couldn't say enough for friends to see it;  now I can buy it and show them what they missed!  I have never been in a movie where the audience consistantly laughed throughout the ENTIRE movie (well, there was ""Anchorman""...).  It's an odd little masterpiece: the leading man is an overweight biker, the leading woman is stunning (but not yet famous in other films) somewhat unsure school teacher, a typical setting is a sushi bar in downtown Boise, Idaho -- and it charms and gets you laughing 'til you don't want it to end.  It's also a gentle film: you can show your parents this and they'll be laughing too, even though it's about tattoos and sex and rebellion.  This is a world where the ""Extra"" who's rowing past in boat says ""hi""; and the leads' friends keep popping up and had the theater roaring.  Quirky, surprising fun.

I'm glad I can put it on my shelf now: a sweeet little romantic comedy that's smart in its humor -- that nobody can say ""I've seen that already.""

You'll be loaning it to frineds.

2100657,3,B0002KQO7Q,"While reading some really judgemental reviews, I was moved to write my view.  If someone is tattooed and overweight, why do people think he would be unattractive to a painfully thin woman.  The storyline was old school goofy. I was just stunned at how many people out there are rude.  I got my tattoo at 38 and my body rocked!!!!!  Virgin's personality and desire to improve himself would have attracted me. You all better take a real good look at yourselves in the mirror and in your soul.",1480032000,,490,4.534090909090909
2100658,1,B0002KQO7Q,"I could not agree more with this review. Exactly the way I felt after the movie. I am also very interested to see a movie pick up from where this left off.
As Mentioned in the Review, ""Id like to see the movie begin where this one left off. After Sara comes back from her road trip to find she has no place to live, no paycheck and no fianc, what will she do next? Will she move into Virgils dumpy apartment? Trade her car for a motorcycle? Will she cover her whole body with tattoos? How will she make a living? Thats real life  not the fantasy this movie presents.""

""Spoiler alert!
The acting in this movie was mediocre and the fake interviews annoyingly cutesy, but most disappointing was the plot. I could imagine Sara getting to know Virgil, and apologizing for judging him at first glance, but I was not at all convinced she would be physically attracted to him. Yes, hes a nice guy  thoughtful, considerate, and he even likes the movies Sara does. But the grossly overweight and physically unappealing tattoo artist makes an unlikely romantic partner for the attractive, almost too thin school teacher. That they are an unlikely couple is what makes them charming, right? But its too great a leap to believe Sara would take to Virgil, his friends and his lifestyle. Would Sara throw away her life for this man? Granted, her relationship with her boyfriend is stagnant. He cant seem to commit, shes too tired for sex, and they say they just don't feel like a couple. But after eight years together, it seems rash to throw away the relationship without first making an effort to work on the issues holding them back. As for Saras teaching career, it appeared she was content with her occupation, and proud of being nominated the teacher of the year  until Virgil came along. After everything Sara invested in her education and her career, shes willing to walk away from it all  in midterm, no less. And for what? What is she gaining by changing her life? Is Virgil bringing out the best in her? Originally, she scolded Virgil for smoking, but now we see Sara has taken up the habit too. She becomes a pot-smoker, develops an interest in video gaming, and hanging out with Virgils sleazy friends. Oh boy!",1477094400,,2209,4.568181818181818

2100757,3,B0002KQO7Q,"Mostly, this is the usual ""wrong side of the tracks"" story. The film is at its best when it's portraying the social debate about tattoos. A silly debate, granted, since it's based on one side wanting to impose on the other side their own personal biases about matters that simply don't affect them at all. But these people do exist in society and the film gives them a voice, as well as an effective rebuttal by the tattoo artists (and by proxy, their customers).

Beyond the obvious social commentary though, there's a decent, sweet love story about a woman (Sara) trying to find herself and a man (Virgil) who is surprisingly well-spoken and philosophically-minded (surprisingly in the sense of, if this person were actually looking for a romantic relationship, surely he would have found it). We never really find out what his backstory is, other than hints that he's in a long process of recovery from ""love lost"" himself. The woman is more an open book, living the life of a shrew, with a job she doesn't really seem to enjoy or be suited for.

Through her initial extreme prejudice against tattoos and those who would wear them, she finds herself questioning and revisiting her own approach to life and love, and with Virgil's help becoming a more ""self-realized"" individual.

With the exception of a couple of characters, the acting is pretty good. Megan Edwards is particularly effective in her role, inducing great dislike and annoyance early in the movie, yet somehow still remaining sympathetic through her evolution, and Benjamin Burdick as Virgil's best friend is also particularly good. The dialogue is a bit stiff, both in the writing and the delivery by a few of the actors. But there are also some pleasantly sharp retorts sprinkled throughout, along with the occasional useful bit of wisdom.

It's no ""When Harry Met Sally"", but it'll do when you've got a hankering for a reasonably light-but-insightful romance.",1412121600,2,1930,4.929230769230769

2100760,4,B0002KQO7Q,"Kinda cheesy, but makes up for it in other ways. Left me feeling pretty good after the end which ironically is a new beginning for a few of the characters. Sometimes doing the wrong thing ends up being the right one.",1411084800,,216,4.2926829268292686

2100767,4,B0002KQO7Q,"I love tattoos. I'm someone who considers them artwork; however, there is some subject matter that I am uncertain why people would want them on their skin as permanent artwork! I was excited to see a movie about tattoos being the subject of ""opposites attract"" rather than that other tattoo movie where the person wakes up and finds they've been covered by their obsessed lover or something. (I haven't seen that one yet because it's out of print. But speaking of which, I've noticed other reviewers making comments about tattooists being portrayed as evil and that is probably the case there!)

This movie was really sweet. I liked it even though I generally dislike romances (they tend to be predictable and gooey). Even though the back of the box told us that the ""uptight schoolteacher"" and the ""hulking tattooed biker"" were going to fall for each other, it seemed kind of abrupt when Sara, the teacher, went seeking out Virgil, the biker, so soon after being apparently horrified at meeting him. I guess it was because they had to fit everything into an hour and a half, but after that, everything moved at a really nice pace. I could easily see how Sara could fall for Virgil. Her mean sister said he was the exact type of guy you wouldn't bring home to Mom and even Virgil thought she was out of his league. But I could totally go for a guy like him too (minus the smoking thing).

The only bad thing I have to say is the frequent swearing. Every character used the f-word continuously... even the ""uptight"" Sara. Besides me personally not enjoying obscene movies, that doesn't make sense. But overall it was a really good movie and one I would definitely recommend.",1337299200,,1673,4.648648648648648
2100768,4,B0002KQO7Q,"This is an endearing and thought provoking movie about Sarah, a straitlaced teacher in Idaho who finds herself falling for Virgil, a heavily tattooed hulking tattoo artist with a heart of gold.

While the movie centers around Sarah's character and her development, I think what sells it in the end is the actor who plays Virgil.  He's a big, obese guy with dozens of tattoos and sort of a person who you might find yourself feeling a bit nervous about if you encountered him on a dark street at night.  But appearances are deceiving, because he's got an artist's soul and a gentle manner that makes plausible the idea that a beautiful young woman might fall in love with him.

Another good point to the film is that while several characters are out of central casting of cliches (Sarah's domineering older sister and Virgil's biker-stoner friends), Virgil's antagonist, Sarah's fiance, is not depicted as a jerk or loser.

Still another plot device of note is borrowed from ""When Harry Met Sally"" in that the movie is interspersed with what we can assume are real people who talk to the camera about how and why they got tattoos.

<spoilers>

One mistake in the plot I think was to have Virgil drop by Sarah's house after they had slept together and get greeted at the door by Sarah's half-naked fiance (after when Sarah and the fiance reconcile briefly).  I suppose that's something that can and does happen in real life but it made me like Sarah a little less and keep in mind the admonition that getting involved with someone who is going through a break up in a long term relationship is a great way to get hurt.

But I give the movie points for not having Sarah run into Virgil's arms at the end.  She instead goes off on a road trip to ""find herself."" And Virgil doesn't say, ""I'll wait for you babe,"" but indicates whether they reunite will depend on what their future selves decide.

But the movie implies a happy ending because Sarah is fitted into the ""real people"" framework I mention above (because she got a tattoo from Virgil before going off on her road trip).  In that brief conversation with the unseen interviewer she mentions she ""fell in love with a biker.""  So I for one am concluding she and Virgil are a couple in the fictional world created by this film.",1322006400,2,2278,4.5675675675675675
2100769,4,B0002KQO7Q,"Tattoo, a Love Story is very differernt from most polished, formulated romanitic comedies I've seen; and for the most part don't relate to.

Sarah Frost(Megan Edwards) is a VERY tightly wound elementary school teacher, who plans and scheduels every aspect of her life, micro managing everything to within an inch of it's life. She dreams of a successful career, a long awaited wedding to her docter boyfriend, and a safe, tame suburbanite existence.

But there's some flaws in the plan, Sarah secretly hates teaching, and oh yeah her boyfriend's about to leave her. Which combined with an unexpected show and tell visitor are the catalyst for the change that sarah desperately needs.

Motorcycle riding, tattoo covered Virgil(Virgil Mignanelli) is that unexpected show and tell visitor. He's a tattoo artist frustrated by clients who are only interested in popularized kitsch. Virg is a big guy with big insecurities, he spends his nights reading and watching the same old black and white movies. In other words Virgil needs a little life in his life.
 touching, funny, and entertaining things happen when these two opposites enter each others lives. Their romance is real and relatable. and the film is interspersed with documentary style interviews, in which people from many walks of life discuss their tattoos.

2100770,5,B0002KQO7Q,"Tattoo is an excellent indie film, a love story about two unlikely lovers; a tattoo artist and an uptight schoolteacher.  Don't think it's going to go down the predictable road, either.  Although I tend to avoid anything with connotations of romance, this was an engaging and entertaining movie; I've watched it several times and bought copies for friends and relatives.

If you want to see a good movie, and don't like the mainstream romances, get this - it's good.  Everyone I gave it to or watched it with liked it.",1187481600,,518,4.722222222222222
2100771,4,B0002KQO7Q,This was a great movie about waking up and finding out who you are and having the courage to follow your own heart.  Well written and insightful about having the strength to be open and true to your own self.,1173312000,,208,4.2
2100772,5,B0002KQO7Q,"I was bored one night in front of the computer. Nothing on TV or anything great to rent. I remember a friend talking about this movie sometime ago. So I went looking for it on Amazon. I stumbled around, before I found it. Order it because it looked interesting.

 My wife and I watched the movie as soon as it arrived . We both loved it . After watching it, both of us agreed it was ashame this didn't get picked up by more theaters. We both were thinking this much more enjoyable than that other show we watched recently ( Napleon Dynomite).
 GOOD FOR GUYS AND GALS! GREAT MOVIE!!!",1163203200,,582,4.2727272727272725
2100773,5,B0002KQO7Q,I love this movie and when I found it on this site I had to have it.  A funny romantic movie for everyone.  Gets the point across that the tattooed and people in the tattoo industry are not EVIL!!! A movie that all can enjoy.,1153008000,,225,3.977777777777778

2100775,5,B0002KQO7Q,I really like this movie.  It is about a hardcore biker whom finds love.  It could be a dude or chick flick.  I would recommend this to anybody whom has ever been in love!,1105056000,,171,3.9705882352941178
2100776,5,B0002KQO7Q,"Good independent spirit.  This movie caught me by surprise.  An affecting love story with some wonderful character roles spark this movie.  Megan Edwards is charming as Sara, the buttoned-down grade school teacher, as she reveals her insecurities and vulnerabilities.  Virgil Mignanelli is compelling as the biker and tattoo artist that unravels Sara's tightly wrapped view of the world.  Both maintained their sensibilities, while yielding to the other in the most unexpected ways.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1098316800,13,516,5.636363636363637
2100777,4,B0002KQO7Q,"I've actually watched, laughed at and been surprised by this movie twice!  (The second time I wanted to share it with my grown daughter.)  As someone approaching 60, tattoos and piercings have been a big mystery to me.  The fascination becomes clear in this unexpected love story.  The film has a very personal feeling.  You want to be friends with the characters - spend some time with them.  And rather than a Hollywood ending, this movie has the right ending.  I'm recommending ""Tattoo"" to all my friends who are interested in film.",1096329600,7,535,4.75
8028518,4,B0002KQO7Q,The whole movie is a tattoo in progress. The characters draw their own tattoos much like the choices they make in their lives. Some people are dancing bears and some are smoking dragons.,1525132800,,186,4.666666666666667

8028520,1,B0002KQO7Q,"Yikes!  This was a well done movie but I have to give one star for the message.  I can understand if Sara didn't want to be a teacher but I would think that this is why she went through the student teaching portion of her education.  If she hated kids she sould have found out then.
 I find it hard that she would be selected teacher of the year with her attitude anyway.  As for Virgil, to each his own but to portray Sara as being enlightened by using drugs, following the pop crowd by marking and piercing her body, and by taking up cigarette smoking is a travesty.  Terrible message, do you really find yourself by taking off on a road trip?  I have never understood this idea.  What does she have to sustain her now?  A pot and cigarette habit?  Goofy/",1515628800,,757,4.230769230769231

8028522,5,B0002KQO7Q,There is a great lesson in this sweet story about passing judgement on people you don't know. i loved it,1510012800,,104,4.25
8028523,4,B0002KQO7Q,"I don't usually write reviews because i figure others will write them better, but i felt this movie deserved my words. This movie to me feels A LOT like Clerks. Same era, same style even had a guy who looks kinda like Dante and a guy who acted like Randal. I enjoyed the film quite a bit once i stepped away from the acting (which i assume was done by ""Found"" talent.) that was sub-par. I think the story was decently written and in the end you do want to know, more while also feeling like you got some answers and closure. To me that's what a good movie is all about.",1504915200,,569,4.089285714285714
8028524,5,B0002KQO7Q,Megan and Virgil character portrayals captured me and I was compelled to watch this one numerous times.  The supporting actors are a mixture of aggravating and entertaining personas. Great writing!,1500768000,,197,5.566666666666666

8028527,4,B0002KQO7Q,"Think outside the box. This isn't an Academy award winning movie, and I don't think it was supposed to be; but it was a good movie. While the ending doesn't really tell the viewer what happens with the main characters, in this movie I found I didn't mind so much that is didn't. In the end both characters are living life on their own terms, not stuck inside someone else's box. For me it was worth watching, gives an insight into people who quit being so 'tight-assed' and people who find a purpose in life in other people.",1488326400,,524,4.357142857142857
