There is nothing that one normally equates with quality or enjoyment in this thing.  Its portrayal of skins is laughably one-sided.  They are merely ciphers with no recognizably human characteristics.  The purpose of this is merely to portray skinheads as vermin needing extermination.  This treatment fails to take into consideration the simple fact that many skins are quite admirable.  They aren't psychopaths and do not commit random acts of murder.  However one feels about a particular group's perceived motivations and philosophy--they still deserve to be portrayed objectively.
For a film calling itself ""Skinheads"", this one shows nothing of the skinhead community.  It is rather misleading in that it suggests that one might learn something about skinheads and how they think.  All we have are cliches that can be gleaned from a typical article about skinhead violence in any commercial tabloid. The  purpose is to not only demonize these particular skins, but all individuals (White separatists, etc) who hold similar views.
The movie merely tries to horrify its audience by making a cheap slasher picture with skinheads instead of a derranged idiot in a hockey mask.  At least when Jason killed the couple for having sex, you got to catch them in flagrante delicto. These skins have no philosophy--they are just mad killers.  The lead skin spouts off cliches about loving Adolph Hitler and the survival of the fittest/strong--but there is no indication that he possesses the capacity to articulate a justification for any of his beliefs. He certainly doesn't express anything remotely coherent about Hitler and why he considers him to be so sexy. He's merely a thug who is dressed up to be a skinhead.  He's completely distructive and utterly devoid of the instinct for self-preservation.  He doesn't care about his ""people"" any more than slugs care about ""Fraggle Rock"".
Strangely, the ""victims"" of the skins wrath are so utterly banal and worthless--that one wishes them to be horribly transfigured into mounds of gibbering flesh.  Instead, we get a lousy shootout, with Chuck Conners replacing his walker with a rifle.  His gleeful sexism and hatred of Nazi ""scum"" make him your all-American hero for like five seconds. I know the director and producers were counting on those images of leather-armed C.C. to give this trainwreck some integrity.  I thought his moronic macho posturing was the funniest thing in the whole damn movie.  Really, I would give this thing 5 stars for its comedy value, but I don't want to even incidentally praise this waste product for any reason.
1/5 stars  *only because it is so funny (and because I can't rate it any lower)*",1087776000,11,2795,5.101098901098901
