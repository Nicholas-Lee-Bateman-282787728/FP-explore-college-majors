7997401,3,B0000AINJ1,"Ok, I bought this film and watched it a few days ago. For me, it's been hard to find films about geisha. This film portrays Geisha as prostitutes, plain and simple. There are a lot of sex scenes, which are totally NOT hot. Most of the sex scenes made me laugh. This film was made in 1974, and it has a sort of Austin-Powers-Meets-Geisha quality to it, although it's not MEANT to be funny.
If anyone has any recommendations about other geisha movies, I'd be glad to hear them.",1351900800,,475,4.348314606741573
7997402,5,B0000AINJ1,This brought the world of the Geisha into a clearer view for me. It brought out some things I didn't know and corrected some misconceptions I had. If you're interested in this fascinating world I receommend this.,1351900800,,212,4.756756756756757
7997403,2,B0000AINJ1,"I bought this film to have one of its genre in my Japanese film collection. I was disappointed because this is not the same film described in Tadao Sato's book on Japanese film. It is directed by Kumashiro and of the correct 1974 vintage, but apparently the various Kumashiro films are different chapters from a book. If you buy it for the sex described in the product description you will be disappointed. And the political climate of the times is quite scantily dealt with as well. The English title is misleading because there are much better films dealing with aspects of the geisha world.",1333065600,2,593,4.711538461538462
7997404,4,B0000AINJ1,"it's actually a warm and ""cute"" comedy.  And rather than being ""soft porn,"" it is, except for one scene, more at ""soft soft"".

Well worth seeing, though the price (overpriced) can be prohibitive.",1241049600,3,195,4.878787878787879
