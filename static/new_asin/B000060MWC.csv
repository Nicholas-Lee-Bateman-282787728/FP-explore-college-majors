1681242,5,B000060MWC,"I am surprised by the negative reviews on this obscure gem of a movie.  In my opinion, Ray Winstone and Sherilyn Fenn gave some of the best dramatic performances of their careers in this one.  Perhaps it is because this is not your typical Ray Winstone movie.  You typically will not find Ray Winstone in a tear-jerker like this one.

Ray Winstone plays John Barrett, a middle-aged accountant from the well-known firm, KPMG.  One day, he visits the lovely home of wealthy couple, Mark and Sally Driscoll.  He holds the couple hostage within the sprawling mansion and proceeds to tell them a heartbreaking story.  Sally Driscoll, angry at first, starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together as the tearful accountant tells the story.  A woman was found in a wrecked car, barely alive.  It was a one-car accident, and not a single witness was at the scene.  How are these three characters connected to the unfortunate woman from the accident?  What connects the lives of these three people?  What could push a successful, mild-mannered accountant to hold this very wealth and very attractive couple hostage at gun point, just to force them to listen to this heartrending story?

If you want to see Ray Winstone and Sherilyn Fenn draw on their considerable talents to pull off the kind of performance that calls on them to show every human emotion there is, then treat yourself to this obscure gem of a film.  This is not an action film, but rather it is a suspenseful drama.  Please do not confuse this with the horror movie of the same name.  I saw both.  That horror movie is one that you could forget.  This one is a diamond in the rough and highly recommended.  You would have to be cold not to get watery-eyed as the socially-awkward accountant relates the story to the Driscolls.  There is a surprise near the end, one that will tie the plot threads together very neatly. The story will unfold through dialogue, but also through flashbacks.

Michael Praed (Robin of Sherwood), Tim Dutton, Anita Dobson, Bryan Pringle, and Olivia Tobias (The Stud) play supporting roles.  The movie takes place in the Isle of Man.

Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance.  You will be glad that you did.",1395532800,5,2202,4.674479166666667
1681243,1,B000060MWC,Omg there's nothing worse than a movie trying to create a buildup where there's nothing to build up. This is the slowest most uninteresting crap ever to grace netflix ( which has now also become crap). Sherilynn fenn you're still hot. Havent really changed since twin peaks. And there's the only reason I watched it.,1372032000,,316,4.763636363636364
1681244,3,B000060MWC,"Darkness Falls (Gerry Lively, 1999)

Darkness Falls has suddenly become a very popular name for films; since 1998, at least six movies containing that phrase in the title have been made (including two, yes two, 2006 movies entitled When Darkness Falls, a Finnish thriller from Anders Nilsson and an Australian indie mystery). I'm not 100% certain, but I also seem to recall at least one book with that name being made into a movie with a different title; just can't remember it off the top of my head. In any case, when you grab something called Darkness Falls, you never know what you're going to get. The one I ended up with is a 1999 British thriller with a stunning cast and a really, really bad director (Lively has since been responsible for such immortal celluloid as Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God and The Art of War III: Retribution, while in his capacity as a cinematographer he has lensed equally brilliant movies such as Future Shock and Hellraiser: Bloodline). Could have gone either way, I guess. And when you get right down to it, it kind of did.

Adapted by John Howlett (the last writing credit to date for the man behind Lindsay Anderson's immortal If...) from a play by N. J. Crisp (one of the writers for much-loved British TV drama Secret Army), Darkness Falls is the tale of the Driscolls, Mark (The Bourne Identity's Tim Dutton) and Sally (Twin Peaks' Sherilynn Fenn). We learn in the opening scene that Mark is involved with some very bad people, and he's hosting a dinner party this night to try and raise some money to get them off his back. But while he's on his way home, a neighbor, John Barrett (the indomitable Ray Winstone, recently of Edge of Darkness... playing much the same character, now that I think about it), drops in to see Sally, and hangs around for Mark... at which point he imprisons them in a room and lays out a theory that Mark was in the car on the day Barrett's wife suffered a horrible car accident that's left her in a coma. From here, if you've seen Twelve Angry Men, you've got a pretty good idea where this is going.

It's not a bad little movie, truly. It certainly could have been worse. While Sherilyn Fenn made some choices that seemed bad at the time (Boxing Helena, which is not nearly as awful as everyone makes it out to be, and Two Moon Junction, which is), she's always been a capable actress, not to mention a very attractive one, and the ten years between Twin Peaks and Darkness Falls did nothing to blunt her appeal on either front. Ray Winstone has been a go-to actor among those in the know for a long, long time now (while the double-whammy of Nil by Mouth and Face in 1997 really brought him into the public consciousness, he's been around long enough to have acted in Quadrophenia), and once again he shows why. The only really flat performance comes from Dutton, and even he shows  few glimmers of life in flashbacks, but not enough to propel the film. Which brings up an interesting idea; had Lively done more to examine the developing relationship between Sally and John, this could have not only been a cracking suspense flick, but a much more original one than it is. Still, Fenn and Winstone do their best, and while you can't say there's a surprise ending (after all, there are only two possible ways to answer the question, so half of you will have it right before you pop the movie into the DVD player), the journey's the thing, and it's not a bad one. Worth checking out. ** ",1277251200,2,3474,4.516693163751987
1681245,3,B000060MWC,"John Barrett (Ray Winstone) wants answers from couple Mark and Sally Driscoll (Tim Dutton and Sherilyn Fenn), so he keeps them both hostages in their own home.  As the movie goes on we find out that Mark had an affair with John's wife, who he met at a fancy dinner with Sally.  When Mark drives Jane (John's wife) home, she becomes clingy and doesn't wanna leave him.  As a result, Tim drives them both in a ditch, killing Jane.  Well Jane didn't die instantly, but she was in a coma.  Jane is pregnant with Tim's child, and she manages to deliver the baby okay, in a coma and all (baby delivered by c-section).

This is a really good movie!  The acting was great, and it was very believable.  Recommended.",1150588800,8,706,4.4186046511627906
1681246,3,B000060MWC,"I think the other review is of another movie.  There is no flying tooth farie in this movie.  Darkness Falls is your typical three person play type movie.  I revolves around three people and you have a few outside scenes to help set up the story line.  Sally Driscoll (Sherilyn Fenn) is a wealthy wife of a busnessman who makes shady deals.  One day a stranger shows up at there house on the day that the husband has a very important diner meeting to try to get some money for a deal when a stranger shows up who is desperat to find out what happend to his wife.  As the night goes on the Driscolls realize that this person is not a stranger at all.
It is relativly suspensful as most of these types of films are, but it is not my favorit type of film.  On the other hand Sherilyn Fenn still looks good and does a very good job.",1060041600,13,828,4.105590062111801

7957405,5,B000060MWC,"""I did intend to be extremely civilized,"" says John Barrett, played by Ray Winstone with a cold-burning flame. But the layers of civility keep falling away, as Barrett, his wife in a coma, pays a call on Mark Driscoll - the man he believes responsible. A strange triangle plays out with Sally Driscoll, played by the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn, probing for the truth from Barrett in spite of herself. The suspense is well played out, as the Driscolls are held hostage by an increasingly emotional Barrett, while another clock ticks down on a hit taken out against Mark for unpaid debt, and his one chance to get the money to cover it. The plot expectedly takes unexpected turns, but each turn is driven by the characters themselves as the truth and substance of who they are gets revealed.",1493510400,,786,4.702898550724638

7957407,5,B000060MWC,"What an entirely awesome little movie!
This was beautifully acted, with rich subtle shifts and really nice dramatic range from all the key actors.  Not only was the acting believable and beautifully intense, there were some interesting and unexpected choices made by the actors... a moment when Ray Winstone's character retreats from anger and insanity into pain and loss... a moment when Tim Dutton's character would be expected to rage and threaten when instead, you can see him pull it back and choose compassion... and Sherilyn Fenn's character's mercurial emotion throughout.  The small supporting cast were all on-the-mark, clear specific characters who were interesting enough to make me want to see more of them.  Except the movie didn't need more of them, or of anything.  Very few locations, very few actors, very consistent and interesting use of camera angles and editing, nothing extra, nothing left out - purely essential movie-making craft.
So often, I know where the plot is going - so many movies come out of hollywood yet so very few plots.  This storyline was very craftily spun... when I thought I new where it was going, something new would be introduced and I'd think... well, no, maybe not.  And then another shift, and I'd think.... well, maybe so.  Never enough information to be sure exactly... a deliciously fluid reframing of the information you already have into something else, and something else again.  Wrap that up with a final scene of people in an impossible situation making yet more unexpected choices and acting that was, again, unexpectedly rich and complex and completely believable.
This really was an outstanding film, and a joy to see some actors I have always liked really show the depth and range of their craft.  Bravo!",1460073600,,1765,5.037800687285223

7957409,3,B000060MWC,"This movie seemed well-acted and the plot was good. The thing that I didn't like was that none of the characters seemed to me to be very sympathetic. The accountant/intruder struck me as a whiny little jerk. I didn't feel much sympathy for him for the way he psychologically tortured his captives. The wife had nothing to do with it. I would have understood it if he just offed the husband, but that wouldn't have made much of a movie, that's the rub. The husband/captive was a psychopath and his wife struck me as not a very nice person, pretty b***hy, although she was sympathetic at the end.",1452816000,,594,4.5092592592592595
