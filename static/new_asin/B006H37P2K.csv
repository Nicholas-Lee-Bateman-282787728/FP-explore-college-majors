4988035,3,B006H37P2K,"I just received this set for Christmas and it was at the top of my list. I already own ""The Philidelphia Story,"" but figured a second copy wouldn't hurt when paired with three other amazing Hepburn movies. I have never seen ""Morning Glory,"" I love ""Stage Door,"" and I was delighted to upgrade to ""Little Women"" on dvd from my ancient and worn-out vhs.

Before I got this collection, I had the 'Romantic Comedies"" Katherine Hepburn collection, and the first Astaire/Rogers collection. Both have two double-sided discs with a movie on each side of the disc, and a disc on each side of the case. When I opened both this Katherine Hepburn collection and my new Errol Flynn one, the discs were one-sided, which I actually prefer, but they were all stacked on top of each other! This makes it difficult to pry the discs off and some were already slightly scratched! Scratched dvds are one of my number one pet peeves. I shouldn't have to store three extra dvds in jewel cases because of poor packaging!

Bottom line: Another great quartet of movies, but TCM seriously needs to get their act together on packaging or I will not be buying these collections anymore.",1356566400,27,1157,4.666666666666667
4988036,5,B006H37P2K,Little Women and Philadelphia Story speak for themselves.  Stage Door was a surprise sleeper.  Witty and snappy dialogue along with a  good story.  Have not seen Morning Glory yet.,1356307200,,180,5.103448275862069
4988037,5,B006H37P2K,"I love this set, I bought it because I was dying to watch 'Stage Door.' 'Philadelphia Story' was a nice bonus and is always enjoyable. 'Morning Glory' is a movie I doubt I'll watch often, but does feature a quality character for Hepburn, requiring her to step a bit outside the norm. You see her weak, which is not often the case with her characters. That aside, the movie itself just isn't very good. Finally, I've yet to watch 'Little Women' in this, or any of its theatrical incarnations, as it simply doesn't appeal to me, so I can't speak toward that film. Overall, this is an excellent set to grab for under twenty dollars, based solely on the inclusion of 'Stage Door' and 'Philadelphia Story.' Also of note, if you are a Lucille Ball fan, be sure to look for her in 'Stage Door.'",1355356800,,787,4.43448275862069
4988038,5,B006H37P2K,"I don't own this as a set, the films here I own already. The best in my opinion are in this order.
Little Women
Stage Door
Philadelphia Story
Morning Glory
and they all rank to me as some of the best films, not just because of Hepburn in the lead parts, but from the plot, direction and that they can be watched many times without getting tired of them.
Many versions of ""Little Women"" are out. but this one tops them all. The 49 version with June Allyson comes in 2nd.
Stage Door, made when she was considered as ""box-office poison."" This film is great from start to end with an all-star cast with Ginger Rogers, Adolpe Menjoi, Ann Miller, Eve Arden and others.
for those who never saw it, it's about wanna be b'way actresses looking for that new role on stage. To tell you anything else would spoil the fun.
it's both comedy blended with drama.
The Philadelphia Story, ca-stars Cary Grant and James Stewart. Stewart won his only Oscar for this film.
Made later as the musical High Society. you will laugh from start to end.
Morning Glory was Kate's first Oscar-winning film. I only saw it once, so much of the details slipped my mind at this point since it's been a while since I watched it.
All I remember was, like the others, it was a great film.
If you never watched these films you will not be disaponited.",1346716800,,1313,4.385245901639344
4988039,3,B006H37P2K,"Shame on you Warner Brothers for this terrible packaging of these four discs! You should NEVER charge us consumers high prices for such terrible antics! Each film is on its own disc, but the problem is each disc is stacked on top of the other!! This is outrageous for them to sell such a great set like this. Two of my discs are scratched and I haven't even watched them yet! I jumped at this set for two movies that are hard to find on DVD, Stage Door and Little Women. If I would've known about this terrible packaging, I would not have purchased this set. Warner should know how delicate DVDs are and should be handled with care. These are not CDs that play with scratches. Once a DVD get scratched, it seems to affect the video in some way. If this is what we got to look forward to from Warner collections in the future, we are in trouble. I wouldn't mind paying ten bucks for this set as is, but twenty!? I realize that I can repackage these discs, but I shouldn't have to. That's why we trust a studio to do the packaging right in the first place. You have been warned if you get this set, be extremely careful when prying these discs apart. This is uncalled for from a major label like Warner. Sad day for us Katherine Hepburn fans.
Other than that, these are five star movies, but I must be truthful in my product review and not give it five stars.
Katherine Hepburn movies deserve better respect than this! By the way, these are awesome transfers. I was too busy complaining and forgot why I bought this package in the first place! These are four films from one of the best actresses that ever lived. Myrna Loy could come in close second.",1332374400,41,1648,4.319354838709677
4988040,5,B006H37P2K,"Katharine Hepburn now gets a nod in TCM's ongoing Greatest Classic Films series.  Despite being a little predictable (for instance do we really need *yet another* PHILADELPHIA STORY--which is also included in at least one other TCM pack), the four selections in this set do showcase Kate the Great in various facets of her remarkable early career.

Hepburn earned raves (and an Oscar) for her portrayal of a struggling Broadway actress in MORNING GLORY.  Fresh off the train from her smalltown, armed with a letter from George Bernard Shaw, Eva Lovelace (""I added the 'Lace'"") storms the office of Broadway impresario Louis Easton (Adolph Menjou), determined on making her mark on the New York stage.  But success will only come after months of living on the edge of poverty, and even then, perhaps only ever be a fleeting ""morning glory""...

""The Calla Lillies are in bloom again...""  Hepburn uttered those immortal words in STAGE DOOR.  Playing a role not terribly far away from ""Morning Glory""'s Eva Lovelace, Hepburn is Terry Randall, an actress who also needs to stake her claim on Broadway - but without the influence of her wealthy family.  Bunking in at a theatrical boarding house (crammed with the likes of Eve Arden, Lucille Ball, Ann Miller, Gail Patrick and Ginger Rogers), Terry's climb to the top will also trigger the descent of another stage-struck wannabe...

The 1933 RKO production of LITTLE WOMEN is still considered the all-time definitive screen version of Louisa May Alcott's literary favourite.  Hepburn relished the chance to play tomboyish Jo March in all her gangly glory.  Hers is one of the great heroines, with a fine supporting cast (Frances Dee, Edna May Oliver, Joan Bennett, Paul Lukas and Jean Parker--heartbreaking as Beth).  Savour the delicious parlour pantomime ""The Witch's Curse"", and the ornate Civil War-era costumes.

Hepburn returned to the top of her form in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, first on the Broadway stage and again on film in 1942.  Playwright Philip Barry reputedly based this frothy romantic comedy on the real Hepburn clan.  Playing Long Island heiress Tracy Lord, Hepburn is squashed between three would-be love interests, including a newspaper photographer (Jimmy Stewart) and an ex-husband (Cary Grant).

4988044,5,B006H37P2K,"This truly is a great collection!  I own several of these TCM collections and Kate Hepburn's collection is by far the best in my opinion.  The Philadelphia story, Stage door, Little women all are 5 star movies.  Morning glory deserves a solid 3 star but a must own for Kate Hepburn's fans since it was her first Oscar winning performance.  Here's why these movies are so great fun.
The Philadelphia story:
This is definitely one of my top 5 Kate Hepburn movies.  This movies showcases the typical views of what most people think of when they think of Kate-snobbish, smart, quick witted, strong willed and beautiful.  She has played this part on stage (Broadway) several hundred times prior to filming this movie and this script was designed/written to mimic her mannerism and speech.  The writer followed her around for some time to achieve this and it shows.  Solid writing, witty, touching....and Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart (won an Oscar for best actor) are superb.  Ruth Hussey's part is excellent.  There is just no weak part in this movie.  Story is interesting as well.  There is a commentary track throughout the film which is interesting as well.

Stage door:
One of my favorite Hepburn movies.  Primary reason why I love this movie is actually not because of Hepburn but because of all the wonderful supporting cast.  Ginger Rogers character is AWESOME.  Her drunk scene with Kate after Ginger Rogers comes back to the boarding house is just so good.  Eve Arden's cat Henry who's wrapped around her neck like a scarf is just a great touch to already great movie.  Lucille Ball is so great in this movie (and I'm not a huge fan of hers).  The scene when she talks to Hatty's date the butcher is just awesome....she's a comedic genius.  Ann Miller's character plays off Ginger Rogers character perfectly and they quarrel like two sisters but you can tell they are very close.  It's just a great great movie (probably better than The Philadelphia story in terms of the entire movie).

Little women:
This is a classic that was made over and over.  Aunt March character of grumpy old aunt is just so good and perfect!  This definitely is a coming of age movie for Jo (Hepburn's character).  She goes from a tomboy who ventures out to NYC to find inspiration for her writing and matures into a woman.....at the same time realizing that inspiration for writing was all along back home with all the simple things in her life such as family and friends.  This is a movie you can watch with your family over and over again.

Morning glory:
A good movie but not as strong as the other three.  Her performance of Shakespeare at the party is supposedly what won her the Oscars....and she is really captivating in that scene.  Being able to hold your breath with just reciting a passage from Romeo and Juliet takes talent....sort of like being able to captivate an audience with just an acoustic guitar playing rather than an entire band.

Even if you are not a Kate fan, you'll enjoy this set if you enjoy good movies.",1480118400,,3016,4.667931688804554

Philadelphia Story is one of Hepburn's best known films and always a joy to watch the three leads banter. My mother-in-law had not heard of Stage Door before but I knew she would be swept up in star studded cast from Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Adolphe Menjou, Jack Carson, and many others. Hepburn's version of Little Women is  by far the best version, ever. I had never seen Morning Glory before, but I wasn't concerned due to the outstanding other movies in the collection.
