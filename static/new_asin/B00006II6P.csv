1776908,4,B00006II6P,"This little collection of curios found in the Disney vaults will likely not appeal to the average viewer or kiddie fan. But, for hard-core Disney buffs and people who are just interested in old documentaries, this is the thing for you.
On disc one, we get ""The Reluctant Dragon,"" which was made as a quick cash-in in the early 1940s. It stars Robert Benchley, who goes on a self-guided tour of the Disney studio, meeting Walt Disney and seeing some very good cartoons (my favorite being ""Baby Weems."") While an exploitation film at core, it's entertaining.
Disc one also contains two short documentaries about how Disney cartoons are made, which were produced as trailers for ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
On disc two, we're treated to three episode's of Disney's ""Disneyland"" TV series, in which Walt would talk about a different aspect of his studio and filmmaking every week. The episodes are ""The Story of Animated Drawing,"" ""Tricks of Our Trade,"" and ""The Plausible Implausible"" (the best of the three).
The contents of this two-disc set are all presented in their original aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Some of them look very grainy, and some of them look fairly good. Being such seldom remastered curios, a critique on picture quality is hardly relevant.
There are some extras as well that will appeal to Disney buffs. On disc one, there are some Leonard Maltin intros, Galleries from ""Reluctant Dragon"" and ""Baby Weems,"" as well as ""Leonard Maltin's Studio Tour.'
On disc two, there are more intros, another gallery, and a Tour of the Disney Studios radio show.
And finally, the set includes a booklet and a mini ""Reluctant Dragon"" poster.",1047254400,2,1646,4.903225806451613
1776909,5,B00006II6P,"As a student who is aspiring to become an animator, I found this DVD set to be very enjoyable. It shows light on classic techniques of Disney animation that has long since been replaced with more advanced techniques, and shows you some history of the Walt Disney Studios. The extras were pretty cool, and Leonard Maltin was a nice tour guide into the world of Disney, for it seemed that he was quite experienced in not only live action movies, but now animation. The one draw back I had against this set is the lack of chapter markers in any of the movies,the speed of the informational track (I couldn't read it because it was going too fast.) and the fact that you went back to the menu after you viewed a part of the disc. I also had wished that they would've taken a closer look into today's animation industry as well instead of just having Mr. Maltin standing near the street post.",1044748800,5,887,4.414634146341464
1776910,5,B00006II6P,"The Walt Disney Treasure series is a mix of great cartoons and some more obscure material.  This DVD fits into the ""obscure material"" category, and has only a few animated segments.
From a Disney and Animation fan's point of view, this is a near perfect DVD set.  Tons of inside information, interviews and snippets with talented Disney animators and voice actors and every good thing are included in the various documentaries.  I particularly enjoyed the history of animation sequence in ""The Story Of The Animated Drawing"" and the interview with the voice of Donald Duck.  It is so strange to watch him talk in Donald's voice!
Much of the information is redundant, and the same sequences show up in a few of the documentaries.  The film, ""The Reluctant Dragon"" is fun, and has the best animated sequences of the set.  However, as a theatrical release film is leaves much to be desired.  As always, Leonard Maltin supplies interesting commentary and insights for the series.
Definitely not for the casual fan.  However, I am sure glad that Disney released this collection.  Educational and fun.",1044662400,4,1095,4.939890710382514
1776911,5,B00006II6P,"Once again, Disney is reaching into its vaults and releasing DVD collections of rarer material.  This set focuses on behind the scenes footage showing the studio at work.
Disc One opens with ""A Trip through the Walt Disney Studios.""  This was the first short of this kind Disney did.  It also served as a promo to movie houses for Snow White.  The optional pop-ups are interesting, and I loved getting a chance to see the first studio.
""How Walt Disney Cartoons are made"" is a slight edit released to the general public to build excitement for Snow White.  Both of these were included on last year's release of that movie.
The last item on the first disc is ""The Reluctant Dragon.""  In it, Robert Benchley takes a tour while trying to find Walt to pitch a story idea.  There are several fun animated sequences as well.
Disc Two is three episodes of Disneyland that break the animation process down further.  This is the real meat of the set.  They are a fun mix of explanation and clips from their movies and each end with a segment from Fantasia.
""The Story of the Animated Drawing"" has a fascinating look at the history that lead up to Disney.  I'd never realized some of what came before.  This one is shown in black and white, but it still interesting to watch.
""The Plausible Impossible"" focuses on story-telling in animation.  It features the famous ""Music in Your Soup"" sequence that was cut from Snow White.  This was the first time I'd seen it all the way through, and I'm shocked it was cut.
The last episode, ""Tricks of Our Trade,"" focuses on things animators do to help them draw realistically.  Not much I didn't know here, but still fun to watch.
Maybe it just takes repetition with me, but I'm finally getting a picture of how animation works, and I've watched shows like these numerous times.  As always, Disney educates us in a fun manner and manages to promo some of his own projects as well.
The set is great for the collector and serious Disney fan.  Leonard Maltin is an informed and enthusiastic host, as always.  (I want his job!)  The sound is adequate, but the picture could have used a touch up in spots.  This is especially true on disc two when they are showing clips from their films.  Still, it serves the purpose well.  I also wish that they had included chapter breaks, especially in the 80 minute ""Reluctant Dragon.""  But, the information is so good I don't really mind.
Any fan of animation will love getting to see how things are really done.  I think I finally have a complete picture of all the work that goes into making a cartoon of any length.  Well worth the money and time spent.",1041984000,44,2621,4.515923566878981
1776912,4,B00006II6P,"Walt Disney was a master of self-promotion, and this 2-disc collection of film and television specials proves it.  The highlight here is the seldom-seen 1941 feature _The Reluctant Dragon_, which offers an extended live-action tour of the Disney studio hosted by famed 1930s humorist Robert Benchley.  Although the film offers a few animated segments to whet audience interest, it's essentially a full-length live-action commercial for future Disney products (including _Dumbo_, _Bambi_, and _Peter Pan_).
Motion picture audiences, who had to pay to get in the theater, didn't take too kindly to a puff piece masquerading as a feature film.  As a result, ""The Reluctant Dragon"" opened to withering reviews and indifferent box office.  But in about a decade's time, a new television audience, which got its entertainment for free, was more tolerant of this sort of thing.  It's no surprise, then, that the rest of the vintage material here consists of Disney's television programs from the 1950s.  Leonard Maltin also hosts a contemporary tour of today's Disney studio.
I found the video and audio transfers in this package lackluster at best; in particular, the short animated film ""The Reluctant Dragon"" (which forms the climax of Benchley's studio tour) is marred by specks, flickers, scratches and grain.  The absence of chapter breaks within the 80-minute feature film or the hour-long television programs is also an annoyance.
Still, this is not a bad package from Der MausHaus, although it's designed to appeal to hard-core Disneyphiles rather than a mass audience.",1038960000,16,1571,5.310483870967742
1776913,5,B00006II6P,"This 2 disc DVD goes inside the walls of the world's most famous magic factory for an inside tour, via several ""behind-the-scenes"" films and television shows.  Much of this material has been hotly anticipated by Disney fans for years as it has never been released before.

1776925,5,B00006II6P,"I had only seen the excerpted cartoon of ""The Reluctant Dragon"" before.  It's so good to see it in its full context.  I have always enjoyed Robert Benchley (grandfather of Peter of ""Jaws"" fame) in the screen roles I've seen him in.  Mostly he did shorts or cameo type appearances, but he's perfect to provide the framework for a look at the studios as they were in his day.  The t.v. shows are good, but it's the feature film that's the highlight of this set and worth the entire price of the set.",1389657600,,497,4.311827956989247
1776926,5,B00006II6P,"The end of Wave two of the Walt Disney Treasures series rounds out with another great nostalgia piece from the Studios' golden years. Disc one starts with A Trip Through The Walt Disney Studios which is an interesting piece that was never meant to be seen by the public is a look at the production of Snow White and studio workings. It's pretty straightforward, but a nice piece to have in this collection. The next feature How Disney Cartoons Are Made is a recycling of the same footage, but much more extended. While you will feel this is a little redundant, it is interesting to see the reused footage when planned for an audience. The main feature on disc one of The Reluctant Dragon a film that also uses some of the footage in both features, but it an enjoyable film with some excellent animated sequences. The bonus material on the disc one is made up of a Studio Tour hosted by Leonard Maltin showing the studio complex, behind the boards of Baby Weems, and two stills galleries one for The Reluctant Dragon and the other about the studio.

Disc two's main content is made up of three Disneyland TV shows. Story Of Animated Drawing, The Plausible Impossible and The Tricks On The Trade. All three programs are interesting to Disney fans and animation fans for sure, but having seen some of the footage on the first disc a couple of times, some of this stuff feels like a rehash. A Kem Weber gallery and Studio Tour radio program finish the set. The transfers all look excellent considering their age and to fans of vintage material a very welcome edition to the Treasures collection.",1378339200,,1591,4.602112676056338

1776928,5,B00006II6P,"If you love Walt Disney, and Disney animation, you need to have this set. Includes some very rare footage, including the deleted scene from Snow White ""How They Got The Soap Out Of Dopey""  Lots of behind the scenes stuff, parts of the Disney Studio I didn't even get to see when I went on the D23 Disney Studio tour.  But my, brings tears to my eyes favorites were the 2 episodes of the Disneyland TV Show ""The Plausible Impossible"" and ""The Story Of The Animated Drawing"", being too young (barely) to have seen the Disneyland TV show, I never really understood why America fell in love with Walt and claimed him as their own Uncle Walt, now I know why.  Those episodes are so engaging, and so is good old Uncle Walt.  Excellent, Awesome, Fascinating!!!",1286064000,,753,4.514705882352941
1776929,3,B00006II6P,"Although I bought this DVD for the main feature, The Reluctant Dragon, it contains more infomercials on the working of the Disney studios.

Even though the insights of the studio are prearranged, you see only what you are allowed to see, it gives you a general idea of the production process for an animation, whether a short or a full feature. But remember, not many studios give you this kind of insight.

The humor is lame and is similar to the humor you find in the Disney shorts with Mickey Mouse, Pluto or Goofy.

Having seen some of those infomercials you get the picture.

The Reluctant Dragon has two scenes to watch: the story board showing of ""Baby Weems"" (which shows it may be a good short), and the featurette ""The Reluctant Dragon"". The live action should be taken for granted and may raise a smile.",1283644800,,814,4.554794520547945
1776930,5,B00006II6P,"This is a glorious piece of Disney history and well worth grabbing whilst you can and before the price triples like the way of the other Treasure sets. Don't be too worried if you don't get the Tin with your set as remember that is only an outer shell.

The content of this set is great though wish could have been more - maybe a six DVD set. I love to see these originals shows as they were and especially the complete shows out of the Disneyland TV show with intro's and all. What we miss in todays TV!!! To see Walt again and introduce these shows as they were is magic and why I believe the entire Disneyland series - as it was - should be released on DVD - fixed up with digital restoration or not.

I could hardly even remember ""The Reluctant Dragon"" - and to see it in full again is awesome. Don't get too caught up in the fact that some of it is in black & white - some in color - flow with the magic of Disney. The other real treats are the entire Disneyland episodes ""The Story of the Animated Drawing"", The Plausible Impossible"", & ""Tricks of Our Trade"". Some great other 'Behind the Scenes' material as well. If you love Disney then you will already have this set... if thinking about it - get it and see how TV used to be - good clean fun & memories!!!",1268438400,,1265,4.117408906882591

1776932,5,B00006II6P,"Walt Disney Treasures Review 5: Behind the Scenes at Walt Disney Studios:Leonard Maltin has done it, again.  He made in myopinion one of the most interesting.  This may not be the greatest quality but it is perfect.  Like all the other treasures, it opens with the Walt Disney Treasure Theater and intro with Leonard Maltin.  When you get to the main menu, you should start at the ""How Walt Disney Cartoons are Made.""  Here, you could choose to view it with a informational subtitle showing history about the short made in the 30s for Snow White.  Leonard Maltin Introduces it as usual.  After this, head over to the crown of the collection, the 1941 feature, ""The Reluctant Dragon.""  Introduced by Leonard Maltin, this film was a compiltation of various cartoons including the one that gave the film its name.  Slid in between it all was comedy footage of Robert Benchley taking a ""Detour"" of the studios.  He looks for Walt and gets sidetracked as he visits the sound effects stage, a recording session with the voice of Donald Duck, visiting the Multiplane Camera, paint room, sees a storyboard for the short ""Baby Weems, and sees the animator's desk of Ward Kimball and watches Goofy's ""How to Ride a Horse.""  After this movie, take a peek at the the film, ""A Trip Through Walt Disney Studios.""  This film was created for RKO to distribute Snow White.  This was remade into ""How Disney Cartoons are Made"" and shown to the public. It is introduced by Leonard.  Finally on disc one, take a look at a few bonus features.  Go look at ""Behind the Boards on Baby Weems"" featurette, a ""Leonard Maltin's Studio Tour"" featurette, and a Reluctant Dragon Gallery.  Disc 2 opens with an intro by Leonard.  He then gets you prepared to watch the second half, the Behind the Scenes Disneyland Shows.  The first one is the pioneering ""The Story of the Animated Drawing.""  This show is in black and white and was the first of three shows Walt would make about animation.  He talks about the history of animation with a remake of ""Gertie the Dinosaur,"" a demo of ""Koko the Clown,"" and early animation devices.  It is introduced by Leonard.  Second is ""The Plausible Impossible.""  This show is in color and came after the show seen before.  Walt talked about things that would be impossible in our world, but seem Plausible in animation.  It is introduced by Leonard Maltin.  Finally, the third show is ""Tricks of Our Trade.""  This one is when Walt Disney shows tricks that he and his animators used to created special effects and easier ways to animate that other studios would never be able to do.  It is introduced by Leonard Maltin.  Final bonus features are, ""Walt Disney Studios"" gallery, a ""Kem Weber Gallery,"" and ""A Trip Through Walt Disney Studios"" radio program.  Considering all the things in the is limited edition set show's age, this is good quality.  This is worthy of ten stars for content, and five for quality.  Buy it before all 250,000 run out.

7969337,5,B00006II6P,"There is a bunch of stuff here that other reviewers have listed so I'll skip that.  The best part IMHO is the terrific behind the scenes look at the Disney cartoon operation c. 1938, long before electronics, much less CGI.  Apparently a lot of theaters were skeptical about the unheard of innovation of a feature length cartoon (Snow White) and needed some persuading. So the Disney folks produced a short explaining in simplified terms what they do and how they do it.  The device is a visit to the Disney studios by humoritst Robert Benchley playing his standard role as a slightly befuddled everyman.  Benchley blunders his way through various production sites including character development, coloring and, of course, animation.  At that time Dumbo was in production and most of the visit involves that film featuring a seldom seen prototype of Casey Jr and the ""Reluctant Dragon"" featurette - all great examples of old-fashioned hand drawn cartoons.  This is very much a period piece and enjoyable not only for film buffs but as a general entertainment film.",1417478400,,1063,4.977401129943503
