8401192,5,B003NIIO9A,"I can't believe this is not available in a simpler form-- $60.00?? I would love to send this out to all of my relatives. When my brain disease has thrown me into depression I watch this and find hope oddly, I can't find a better medicine to recover with. Knowing there are others out there with this same disease helps me to heal. Thank You Stephen Fry- you will never know how much you have helped me.",1470614400,,402,4.233766233766234

8401194,5,B003NIIO9A,very moving and educational. Stephen Fry what a brave man!!would you press the button? some parts are hart breaking and yet still moments of humour.a very well put together documentary which i feel only just scratches at what is a big issue.i loved it just wished it was longer.,1381104000,,278,4.6938775510204085
8401195,5,B003NIIO9A,"Outstanding documentary. Must see for anyone wanting to better understand bipolar disorder, and interesting viewing for anyone. Very informative. Stephen Fry is excellent.",1373068800,,171,6.478260869565218
8401196,5,B003NIIO9A,"Stephen Fry gives a very touching and personal description of what it is like to like with bipolar disorder (or manic depression). As well as his own story, he interviews a number of others touched by the disorder, as well as g odd background as to what is known about it and what can be done.

This DVD is in region 2 pal format. I suggest either watching it on a computer with software that ignores region codes (I use vlc or xine on Linux.) or get a region free player. It should be available in region 1, but I have no idea why it is not.

If you, or anyone you know, has mental health issues then you need to watch this film.",1372291200,,630,4.07258064516129
8401197,5,B003NIIO9A,"Candid, brave, somewhat optimistic but never falsely bright, this film is daring in it's relentless examination of bipolar disorder from the perspective of a lay person living with this type of brain chemistry.  Fry is an eloquent and touching central figure.",1372118400,3,259,5.317073170731708
8401198,5,B003NIIO9A,"It was an interesting look on the inside of people suffering this disability,it helped immensely with us gaining more knowledge about what our daughter is going through.",1362873600,,169,5.296296296296297
8401199,5,B003NIIO9A,"I started watching this on the internet. It was so well done I wanted to pay for it (feeling funny about getting so much valuable information for free). I couldn't believe it was not available in the USA format (only the UK release).  So I watched it in its entirety on the internet and find myself still quoting from it and remembering scenes from it that are helpful to me. It is MUCH more than a documentary about Stephen Fry's life living with bipolar. He has compiled a comprehensive collection of stories of others with the illness. It shows how the illness is so different between people and that people find their own ways of dealing with it. So no matter how your symptoms (or those of one you love) present themselves, you will find inspiration and kinship with someone in this series, including Richard Dreyfuss, Carrie Fisher and others famous and not famous.

If you have a DVD player that plays all region's DVD's then go ahead. I HIGHLY recommend this. If not, keep your eyes pealed for a release in the USA format as I am doing.",1319414400,14,1044,4.518518518518518
