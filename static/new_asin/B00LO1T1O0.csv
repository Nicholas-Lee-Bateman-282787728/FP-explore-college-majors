6493870,4,B00LO1T1O0,"Bruce is clever to bring up the parallel. Like ""Frances Ha"" this has great, black and white cinematography and is about a rootless twenty-something. However, it wasn't quite as emotionally engaging. ""Frances"" had a plot about a lost friendship while this didn't have that kind of thread running through it. I did enjoy that fact that every time the guy tried to get a coffee something prevented him.",1413331200,3,399,4.882352941176471
6493871,5,B00LO1T1O0,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie and how much I thought about it afterward. I walked out of the theater onto a Los Angeles street at midnight and everything seemed more interesting and alive than normal. Even walking into a 7-11 for a Coke seemed interesting.

There are obvious parallels to ""Frances Ha"" (which I also liked) but I think there are more levels to Coffee in Berlin. Both films are ""slice of life"" films about a meandering 25 year old. Coffee in Berlin takes place over about 24 hours. Niko is a 25 year old with a sometimes girlfriend who dropped out of law school, putters, and lives on a stipend from his businessman father - who THINKS he is still in law school. The day starts badly when his ATM account is frozen - Dad has figured it out. Through the course of the day and night Niko meets various characters in unpredictable circumstances, never manages to get his cup of coffee, and has a meeting and brush-off from his disappointed father. It's not clear exactly what Niko's ""character development"" is, in the classic sense. He's living out the hour of 3 pm because, well, that's the hour that follows 2 pm. People suggest where he should go or take him there. For me, such a movie could be a flat tire or a winner - some odd combination of interest and resonance makes this movie a winner for me.

I like to think you can also see a level of symbolism below the surface story (though you don't have to). His father pretty obviously symbolizes postwar German industry and recovery - nose to the wheel, no time for laziness, and hard work. An old man he meets at the end with stories of the Hitler era clearly symbolizes that era. I think the crazy ex girlfriend he encounters might symbolize East Berlin or East Germany - ""I used to be ugly, but now I am better, and I'm right here in your face, and I want you to love me, and by the way, I'm crazy as a bat from all the change I've been through."" Two grifters he meets on the subway might represent either government or capitalism or some other kind of bully which is a paper tiger. Nearly every character he starts the movie with - his main girlfriend, or father - seem to disappear. (Even the crazy girlfriend who pops up in the middle, then disappears.)

Niko's hour-by-hour episodes of adventure through a hard day's night might also remind you of the 1985 film AFTER HOURS.",1409702400,39,2368,4.414187643020595
6493882,5,B00LO1T1O0,"Good German movies are hard to find. Ask German people and they will admittedly say there are some good ones, but not that many. I know this because I'm half German and visit Germany often and this is what I've heard and seen for myself. I've scrounged the internet and forums to find good films to watch, A Coffee in Berlin is one of my favorites.

The movie is about a 20-year old Tom Schilling moving into a new apartment and sort of wandering through Berlin with his friend Matze. Tom Schilling is a great actor and he plays his role well. Without spoiling the plot to much this sort of a comedy where Tom bumps into random people and weird and strange things happen. There's no concrete plot to movie which makes it unique, and I really like the cinematography, as it is shot in black in white giving it a timeless feel.

If you're trying to find a film this is a great one to watch. As of this writing it is on Netflix and you can watch it with or without subtitles. I speak German and always get annoyed when I find a film that doesn't let me turn the subtitles off. Anyways, this movie is $2.99 to rent the SD version on Amazon and I highly recommend that a person do so if they want to watch a fantastic German film!",1443830400,,1225,4.208510638297873

6493884,5,B00LO1T1O0,"Some days simply don't go well. ""A Coffee in Berlin"" is a well made movie about the trials of life that can befall a young and not particularly self-confident man who has such a day. Along the way, we see much of Berlin.

One reviewer described the movie as a love letter to Berlin. I would agree. Shot in black and white Berlin shows itself beautifully. I'm not sure if one needs to know much about Berlin to enjoy ""A Coffee in Berlin,"" but some knowledge of Berlinische life will add to the emotion of the movie.

Aside from showing life in Berlin, this movie offers many treasures. Some scenes are very funny. Others are painfully sad. I found myself drawn in and watching closely to the end, and I wondered what might come next. I'm older now. I feel little nostalgia for the pain one can feel in living as a young man, but I certainly feel a strong desire to spend more time in Berlin.",1438819200,2,890,4.323353293413174
6493885,4,B00LO1T1O0,It's sort of like a Woody Allen film in German with subtitles,1433894400,,61,4.166666666666667
6493886,3,B00LO1T1O0,I don't like black and white movies. I did not finish it once I realized it's not in color. Maybe I'll go back and watch the rest and be surprised if it switches to color :),1433376000,,173,3.8333333333333335
6493887,5,B00LO1T1O0,"I liked this film a lot, but can't really explain why.  The lead actor is very good, very charming, sort of a latter day German version of James Dean.  He plays another lost soul, not quite a rebel without a cause, but with enough of that flavor to be likable.  Even his looks, the small, wirey frame, the longish hair and sweet features are similar.

Not a lot happens in the film.  It covers one day in the life of a 20 something law school dropout in Berlin.  It starts with him leaving a girl, in the morning, after having spent the night.  She wants him to stay but he moves on, says he has a lot of things to do. The day unfolds in this mode, one near-miss after another.  After each encounter he asks for coffee but never quite seems to get it.  Strangely, even though there's nothing of a traditional happy ending, it left me with a sort of quiet smile inside.

6493903,4,B00LO1T1O0,"I saw this movie in a theater, liked it enough to want to own it.  I actually liked it better with the second viewing.  I haven't read other Amazon reviewers about it, so this may be repeating something someone else has noted, but the film has some strong similarities to Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"".  Not in terms of plot, but in terms of its style:  filmed in black and white, uses a mostly jazz soundtrack, and has nice cinematography of the city of Berlin.  It's a visual ""love letter"" to Berlin, in much the same way that ""Manhattan"" is to NYC.  It is not a fast-paced movie, there is not a lot of action, it is more of a character study.  The lead character is sort of a gormless young man, adrift and rudderless in life, but this film's ""day in his life"" manages to be by turns funny, engaging, and poignant in spite of the central character's maddening lack of gumption, direction, or clear thought.",1424908800,,905,4.448484848484848
6493904,4,B00LO1T1O0,"This film has a recurring gimmick about coffee where every time the protagonist tries to get a cup something goes wrong.  But the rest of the film is not a comedy.  Niko is about 28 years old, has no job, and does not appear to know anyone who has a regular job (besides his father).  He appears to live in former East Berlin which is still the low rent district.  As a result of all this he drifts around and constantly encounters weird characters.  Most of them end up being annoyed with him.

The movie ends up representing three generations of Germans.  Niko of course is the millennial generation.  He likes spending money but has no plans to get a job and dropped out of law school two years ago.  His father is a successful lawyer with a strong work ethic, part of the post-World War II baby boomer generation which produced the German ""economic miracle"" that made Germany the third largest economy in the world, until recently surpassed by China.  At one point Niko runs into an old man in a bar who is about 82 and was a young boy during the Nazi era.  This man rambles on and is barely coherent, as if the war permanently disrupted his education.  He represents all the disruption the war caused for Germany.

After the father finds out that Niko has been out of school for two years, he drastically cuts Niko's allowance.  Niko probably goes on welfare.  Or maybe he is already on welfare.  The film does not address this issue.  Maybe it is too obvious to mention.  Nearly all the characters he encounters must be on welfare.",1424563200,,1537,4.467625899280575
6493905,2,B00LO1T1O0,"The German was okay considering this was an art film, but I felt like it ran to long and it took several day for me to get through this film.",1424390400,,141,3.7333333333333334

6493907,5,B00LO1T1O0,"A very small, but very rewarding German film which wears its directorial influencesWoody Allen, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Linklateron its sleeve, but honors them rather than registering as a pale imitation.  Set in Berlin and photographed in attractive B&W, the film consists of day-in-the-life vignettes involving a friendly, but desultory law-school dropout and the various idiosyncratic people he encounters, including his emasculating father, a now-sexy woman he used to taunt at school for her obesity, and an elderly gentleman haunted by his childhood memory of Kristallnacht.  The film is often very amusing, expertly drawing humor from uncomfortable situations and the small frustrations and grievances of daily urban life.  (There is an ongoing gag which finds our hero thwarted again and again in his pursuit of a cup of coffee.)  It is also a sad film, though, and even brought a tear to my eye.  Without overplaying its hand in any melodramatic way, it understands indecision, melancholy, neuroses, and regret.  Its sense of dreamy gloom intermingles with and deepens the conversational and situational comedy, particularly in the third act.",1419120000,10,1149,5.463276836158192
6493908,4,B00LO1T1O0,"I will use this in a film course on ""slackers"" going all the way back to Fellini's ""I Vitellonii"".  This contemporary tale has a haunting Third Reich twist ending.",1419033600,,163,4.620689655172414
6493909,5,B00LO1T1O0,"A touching and ""real"" portrait of ""millennial malaise"".  The movie has been compared to ""Frances Ha,"" but I would add it also has shades of ""Inside LLewellyn Davis"", when it comes to the ""protagonist's"" dubious innocence in regards to the sundry misfortune that befalls him.",1417910400,,274,5.088888888888889
6493910,4,B00LO1T1O0,Well done. Not a ground breaking movie but interesting to watch,1417564800,,63,4.818181818181818
6493911,5,B00LO1T1O0,"I've thought a lot about this movie since I watched it, trying to put the experience into words. A lot of people would dismiss such a film on the grounds that ""nothing really happens in it,"" but it's not a film that's meant to appeal to those kinds of people. It's just a day in the life of a young man drifting along, directionless, like a little toy boat in a stream, trying to decide what he should do with that life, and he's surrounded by people who want him to just hurry and make up his mind. He resists, but he doesn't know why.  So I suppose it's a movie for thinkers and dreamers, and not for people of action, or those who who find themselves content with everyday, ordinary experience. If any of this makes sense to you, then you should see A Coffee in Berlin. And if my review sounds like a lot of meaningless nonsense, then I'm pretty sure that you should not see this film either. Leave it to those who can appreciate it.",1414195200,24,936,4.229050279329609
8667044,3,B00LO1T1O0,"I love Berlin.  Love love love Berlin.  This film is reaching for something, but it's not clear.  ""Aimless"" is one way to put it.  When reading the reviews I got the impression that I would see a lot of Berlin or at least some of its allure.  I did not get much of that, but you do see a lot of its urban sprawl and sort of this background of a city that is far from perfect.  This film ends on an interesting note, leaving the viewer with a deep feelings that it kind of lacks through out the film.

The main actor, Tom Schilling, is very charming as he sort of drifts through a terrible day.  I really enjoyed his performance, and you see everything through his eyes so to speak and his reactions are priceless.

I enjoyed the film, the German spoken in this film is understandable mostly to an intermediate speaker- so enjoy it and learn some phrases if you are not fluent in German.

8667047,5,B00LO1T1O0,"Of all the major cities and metropolitan centers in Germany; Berliners, when compared to the rest of Germans, fancy themselves ""Parisians,"" or ""New Yorkers"" for that matter. In this wonderful little film; A Coffee in Berlin (from 2012), first time director Jan Ole Gerster offers us a view of ""slice of life"" in modern Berlin, in the course of a day. The impressions of Berlin and its multi-layered inhabitants is from one ""down-on-his-luck,"" twenty-something---'Niko' (the wonderful Tom Schilling from the great mini-series ""Unsere M&uuml;tter, unsere V&auml;ter,"" from 2013). Who reminds me a lot of a latter-day Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud, except he's not as chatty and more sympathetic. Watch; as an intelligent, introspective, and weary eyed 'Niko,' surveys the city for that ever elusive cup of coffee. There was an important scene early on, where 'Niko' gets drilled and tormented by the bureaucratic ""red tape"" that one encounters in every major city in the entire globe!

This film recalls the form and style of Jean Eustache, Jim Jarmusch, and Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (at least, it does for me), and that's the reason I took to it immediately, when I first watched it a couple of years ago. Tom Schilling and the rest of the cast were just amazing. I highly recommend this interesting and wonderful film. There's nothing like a good cup of coffee!

The DVD picture and sound quality by Music Box Films is excellent. NTSC, widescreen, 1.85:1 aspect ratio, German (English subtitles), audio: 5.1 or 2.0, extras, etc., NR 85 mins.
