I'm really impressed with the variety of activities, music, and quality of the production. Great tool teaching children all about nature and the things around us.  I like to control what my 2 yr. old son watches on tv and Lots To Learn Nature is a dvd must have!",1275955200,,402,4.181818181818182
8030649,4,B0002Q7WNU,"I haven't seen the entire series so I can't speak for other Lots to Learn, Preschool videos. I think this is a fun, varied video that would keep most preschoolers interested though I'm not sure if there's enough educational versus entertainment content. That question is really one of a delicate balance because any video producer doesn't want to make something so dry they loose the kids interest, but I would have liked to have seen more topical focus. Nature is such a broad topic. It seemed like so many topics were included that topical depth suffered making this more of a good one time viewer rather than a video one would watch several times to reinforce concepts. In most regards I liken this video to what's currently on Sesame Street without the puppets, commercialism or subtle political messages. Which is to say I think if PBS offered this or Sesame Street, Sesame Street would probably slowly go off the air.

My only criticism is that this video is really geared toward preschoolers who can already talk and have a fair grasp of nature concepts. I had hoped this might appeal to my child who is just building words and has yet to put two of them together. You really can't tell that about this video until you begin watching. That said, I highly recommend borrowing, renting or checking out a copy from the library for a preview before purchasing.",1264809600,,1363,4.702928870292887
8030650,5,B0002Q7WNU,"""My four year old son loves this series. Like most four year olds, he can be very picky (about everything!) and this series is his hands down favorite thing to watch. While being very entertaining, this is also a great educational experience. Our son has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended."" -- L",1226966400,,377,4.5588235294117645
8030651,5,B0002Q7WNU,"My kid just loves the dvds. His fav is Nature, he has progressed so much
after watching the dvds about 3-4 times.",1223337600,,113,4.181818181818182
8030652,5,B0002Q7WNU,"So far, this product is the best baby DVD. My son Sam,can't get enough of it. In this movie, your kids can learn about shape: circle, rectangle, square and how many sides they have, also color, mix and match, memory game, nature (what rain comes from), animals on the beach and in the ocean. The movie comes with imaginative video & colorful animation. We like the music because it's energetic,fun & comes with educational words like ""fish in the ocean, there's lots to learn from around us, ocean mountain"", etc; unlike other DVDs that play Old macdonald, etc, those boring songs. The story in this movie are using kid's voice so it capture more attention. And the best part is the exercise with nature, it's exercise shown by a lot of kids, they stretch, go up & down, claps, turn around with the songs. This dvd is actually the best from all of the Lots to learn DVDs.",1219622400,,871,4.518987341772152
8030653,4,B0002Q7WNU,"My 18-month old son loves this video.  The scenes and music are entertaining.  My major gripe is that it gives the wrong definition of a triangle.  It states that a triangle ""has three sides that are the same size.""  That's the definition of an equilateral triangle and not a general triangle.  I am surprised that no one has caught this error.",1203811200,2,344,4.573770491803279
8030654,4,B0002Q7WNU,"My 19 month-old son can't get enough of this video and it is the first video he requests.  It has great background music and presents concepts very well.  It is visually beautiful and educational.  The only part of the video that gets tiresome is of the children painting, though it doesn't seem that way to my son.  This is one of the best videos we own, and we have many.",1170720000,,373,4.285714285714286
8030655,5,B0002Q7WNU,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. Though a challernge to find this small studio release, we tracked it down after hearing so much positive feedbac k from friends and teachers. We researched further and found great reviews in Scholastic's Parent & Child, Dr. Toy, National Parenting Center and other similar orgs.

My kids agreed, as they loved the songs, dancing, exercises, and watching other kids on-screen while learning.

Do yourself, and your kids a favor, and pick up Lots To Learn (I think they only have two DVDs right now) It was really good.",1143158400,,550,4.840425531914893
8030656,5,B0002Q7WNU,"This dvd is very colorful and bright.  The music is realy great and includes a lot of different music styles.  The dvd is full of all kinds of pictures and video of things in nature such as butterflies, fish, fruit, waterfalls, sunsets, the beach, shells, etc.  They cover a lot of things in 30 minutes like counting, the alphabet, matching, colors, sounds, and more.  Because they cover so much, they don't spend a great deal of time on each thing.  So, if you are looking for a dvd that teaches those specific things in more detail you might need something that covers it more thoroughly.  But, this is a great way for your child to practice what they are learning.

When they count, a childs voice will say the number and then another younger childs voice will repeat it (they also do this with the alphabet).  This gives your little one a chance to repeat the number and letter.  Then they say, ""That was fun.  Lets do it again.""  The second time they count they say it in Spanish.

They have matching and memory games (my favorite).  As an example, for the matching game they will show a picture of a bright yellow fish.  Next to the fish are 6 different colored squares.  They ask to match the color.  It gives a few seconds for your child to point to the yellow square.  Then the yellow square flashes.  It's almost as if it flashes because your child touches it.  For the memory game they will show you four items (such as 4 different kinds of fruit).  Then they get covered up by neat looking baskets or boxes.  They ask if you remember where the apple is, etc.  The child can point to the basket with the apple under it.  Another one of my favorite parts of the video is the fish.  You might not think that fish can be pretty but they really were.  There's lots of really pretty underwater video of fish in the ocean.

My daughter is 18 months and on the cover of the video it says for ages 2 to 5.  I think she probably is a little young for a lot of this and the first time she watched it it didn't hold her attention too long.  But I'll keep playing it for her and I know as she grows she is going to be more interested in it and she will love it, I am sure.  While I watched it the first time she was playing in the same room and often got up to dance to the music.

Lots To Learn is sooooo much better then most of the Baby Einstein dvd's we've watched. In Lots To Learn Nature it is so colorful that it's almost breathtaking....a real feast for your eyes.  The music is varied and there are also quite a few songs with kids singing.  They also sell a music cd with lyrics that has all the songs and music from the dvd.  This is great, too, and you'll find yourself singing and dancing right along.  The exercise song is really cute.  Also check out Lots To Learn In My House.  I have more reviews for you to read.",1114473600,9,2829,4.193308550185874
8030657,5,B0002Q7WNU,"I just watched this DVD with my kids.  I had heard about it online after reading reviews on the VHS version, and found the DVD to be better than anything out there I've seen.

It was educational, fun and entertaining, and we enjoyed watching it...together!

The kids loved all of the segments, and after watching it over and over, they are doing better with the alphabet, counting, colors, shapes, and we even have fun dancing and exercising together.  Love the music.

You won't be disappointed.",1091664000,4,496,4.788235294117647
