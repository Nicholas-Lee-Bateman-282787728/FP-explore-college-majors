It's not even worth wasting money to rent it. Sure, I didn't see the whole movie but I saw enough to know that it was bad.

  I was a big Dragonball Z fan and I really wish they made more of an effort in starting a movie series. The movie got the quirkiness of the series right but...that's about it.

  The movie has horrible costumes, stupid action sequences and bad set pieces. While  Justin Chatwin is just painful to watch as Goku. He's annoying, can't act and he looks like a fan that just played dress up and made a Dragonball movie with his friends. He was a horrible choice for the role. He doesn't even look like Goku.

  I was hoping that playing Piccalo would be a break-out role for James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but that's not the case. He wasn't a bad choice for the role but this movie isn't going make anyone a star. Hell the movie even managed to make Chow Yun Fat look bad as Master Roshi. Yes, he's perfectly goofy as him but while giving a bad performance. His outburst about how he's the great Master Roshi when he's introduced is embarrassing and awkward especially compared to his great work in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

  The movie is based on the show that was just called Dragonball I should mention. There was no Vegeta, Trunks , Frieza or Cell in that series. Krillin was left out as well even though he was in the Dragonball series.  The show had Goku trained by Master Roshi, looking for dragonballs with Bulma and fighting in tournaments. He also transformed into an ape occasionally. While Piccalo was the main bad guy in Dragonball.

  So the movie got some things right but it's still a made for dvd quality film. Goku's ape transformation is horribly done, he just looks like a guy in an ape costume. I thought visual effects have gone further than that. In closing, the Dragonball series, deserved a much better production. If Speed Racer was on worse movie lists of last year, then Dragonball: Evolution definitely will be this year. The movie makes Speed Racer look like Gone With the Wind.",1237507200,8,2210,4.540404040404041

3630655,1,B001HN69AE,"This movie seems as though it goes out of its way to ignore everything about Dragonball.  And remember, folks.. This is a DRAGONBALL movie, not Dragonball Z.  It doesn't give two shits if the story is mangled to the point of being unrecognizable.  The characters are terrible, and in no way resemble themselves..  This was an attempt at a cash grab, and everyone involved should be ashamed.",1517011200,,390,4.776119402985074

3630658,2,B001HN69AE,NOT for the avid fans of Dragonball! Not accurate and kind of cheesy. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do like some of the actors and some parts made me laugh a little.

3630660,1,B001HN69AE,I saw this movie when it first came out.  Im only writing this review to save your time and energy.  Especially if your a DBZ fan and for some reason haven't heard of this disaster.  I haven't seen this movie in years and when i was scrolling to see what i could put on next and saw this.  The  Legendary Broly awoke and I went berserk with anger.  But on a serious note.  This movie sucks.  No I take that back.  This movie is like pouring acid in your eye balls all while having someone punch you in the stomach while hitting your head with a bag of Dragonball: Evolution dvds.  You have Dragon Ball as your source material and this is the garbage you put out.  I don't know a single Dragon Ball Fan who liked this movie and Im talking about the whole Community of Dragon ball.  I hope the next person who even thinks about writing a scrip for a live action dragon ball z will look at this movie over and over and over again as punishment before they even start to imagine writing a live action script so we don't get another one of whatever this was supposed to be.,1510012800,,1068,4.15609756097561

1: why make a movie out about one of the greatest anime and manga series ever knowing that you have the s*$ties cg effects that do nothing but ruin the effect...

3630731,2,B001HN69AE,"I don't think that in our life time any studio, no matter what country it is
filmed by, is going to be able to make a decent Dragon Ball movie.
But I give this movie a little credit...
What I liked was:
1. Bulma and Chi-Chi were not whiny like they
were in the manga, anime, etc. They were actually
very helpful and well played-out.
2. Justin Chatwin did do his best to play Goku.
3. Most of the costumes looked cool.

What I didn't like was:
1. Chou-Youg-Fat looked more like Master Roshi in 'Pirates Of The
Caribbean: At World's End' then he did here in this movie
2. The visual effects were too cartoon-ish.
3. Oozaru is suppose to be a lot bigger that he was in this movie.
4. Yamcha was too weird.
5. They could have used Piccolo a lot more than they did.
6. The battles were way too brief and forgettable.
7. Some of the dialogue was corny.

Overall: This movie was a let down to many Dragon Ball fans.
But as I said before; I don't think they will be able to make a
decent Dragon Ball movie any time soon.
My grade: C or two stars.",1480723200,3,1038,4.083333333333333

Everything one would love about the anime throw it out of the window. ugh I didn't watch it on Amazon but I did watch it on many years ago and absolutely hated it.",1478044800,,471,4.0212765957446805

Also the bad guy arrive ""in a time before many can remember"" You see knights and stuff so you could probably guess a few hundred years ago. OH WAIT! That means Goku is not 18 but Several Hundred years OLD! Really! Really! Thats just the very very top of the hollow cakes that this thing is. Their are so many other things I could touch on this movie but I do recall out of the hour and 40 minutes it took me an additional hour to finish. I had to pause it and go get depression food and spent thirty minutes doing that while trying to figure out or process what I just saw. I know the scenes were so bad that I can't even remember what they where because my brain said Nope Nope Nope out with you. It refuses to remember it. That happen twice. TWICE! I spent two hours and forty minutes trying to finish this abomination. Almost three hours of my life I'll never get back. The acting is terrible, the casting is horrendous, the story is wrong and filled with plot wholes. The worse part is at the end (SPOILER!) When they screw up Goku's Kahmahamaha. Its a beam with a range so it extends then he hast to move forward because it won't shoot out any further. Wait no no no I'm sorry it came back to me. The worse scene in this entire movie. Is when they use that attack, DESTRUCTIVE ENERGY! To resurrect a fallen ally. That likes Oh look this guy has a fatal wound I'll heal him by setting him on fire. IT DOESN'T WORK! How and why they thought that was a good idea I don't know. Just like I don't know why they thought calling it both Kea and air bending was good is just as bad. Justin Chatwin plays Goku and he has this part where he says. ""I must believes in my self."" The acting at this part is so bad it really sounds like he was not even trying let alone care about being in the movie anymore. He plays Goku as if he was a emo trouble child who can't get the girls. This is not Goku. Goku is a fighter and stands up for what he believes in. Justice and protecting the Innocent. I love Dragon ball Z I'll get around to watching Dragon ball but it dose not take much to know this is a terrible movie.

YOU KILLED HIM! you CLEARLY cant carry on making the later sagas when you kill Picilo. This was just a Disgrace and a slap in the face to all DBZ fans world wide!. DO IT AGAIN!!! just follow the story! there's YEARS of it! Raddits, picilo, Freeza, Majin boo, Cell, ect! thats 5 entire movies rite there! (Bangs Head against desk) and this movie is 6 years old, so that tells me there is no intention on correcting the abomination...

This movie makes use of the character's names, coupled with what feels like a very generic ""quest to save the world"" plot with some Martial Art movie tropes.

Ok sure so grandpa found him as a baby shortly after crash landing on earth. Still, I think it would have suited dragonball far more had they chosen a japanese actor to play Goku. I'm sure he would have nailed Goku better than any other race playing Goku.

I have a few other gripes, but I think giving a few praises ought to be considered since there's already more than enough bad reviews about the movie.

I liked how Goku was raised by his grandpa up until his high school years. That at least gave Goku more time to spend with his grandpa before Gohan was killed.

I liked the fighting styles between Goku and grandpa Gohan at the beginning of the movie.

The casting in this movie was pretty bad as well, aside from Piccolo (James Marsters) and Mai (Eriko Tamura) who did good jobs as there characters. Most of this movies faults come from bad writing.

The teaser trailer alone had me hyped up! I was wondering how much work they were gonna put in the movie, how cool the effects were gonna be, how amazing the fights would look!.....then the movie came out and was bashed into the ground like cheap five dollar hooker on a bad day. This movie has been nitpicked, bashed, and had been utterly destroyed by everyone, from movie critics  to random fanboys and fangirls you find on YouTube, people have been complaining non stop: ""They have white people playing as the Dragon Ball characters!"" ""Piccolo  is not green enough!"" ""It wasn't as fast as the anime!""

But is it really that big of a train wreck? Is this movie worthy of putting it on the shelf of s*** movies in between `Street Fighter the Legend of Chun-Li' and `Batman and Robin'?

First off, the cast. Why are people making a big deal about this? I mean sure, they could have gotten other actors besides Justin Chatwin for Goku or Jamie Chung for Chi Chi, but they got some pretty good actors to play the part. As for James Marsters, he did a fantastic job as Piccolo being the evil bastard he is (or if you want to get technical, the evil bastard he used to be). As for the race for the characters on Earth, there technically is no race on Earth besides Earthlings or humans. And no, just because Dragon Ball Z was made in Japan doesn't mean that the characters are Japanese as well. That's like saying every character made in the U.S. in Marvel comics are only Caucasian, it makes no sense. Chow Yun Fat did a great job as Master Roshi, it looked like he was haveing fun with it too what with the overacting he did, but that's what made me enjoy it more.

Story now, is something to discuss about: Two thousand years ago, the demon Piccolo came to Earth, wreaking havoc with his minion Ozaru. Seven mystics created the Mafuba and thought they sealed him away for eternity. Piccolo breaks free and  begins to search for the seven Dragon Balls (each one has stars numbering between one and seven), killing anyone in his way. While that's happening, Goku is given the 4-Star Dragon Ball by his grandfather on his 18th birthday before he goes to high school. Returning home from a party hosted by his crush Chi Chi, Goku finds his home destroyed and his grandfather near death after Piccolo's failed attempt to acquire the Dragonball. Before Gohan dies, he tells Goku to seek out martial arts master Muten Roshi, who has another one of the Dragonballs. Along the way, Goku meets Bulma of the Capsule Corporation, and eventually also meets Yamcha. Together, they try to find all seven Dragon Balls before Piccolo finds them. Now that sounds like a regular plot now doesn't it? Because I really don't know what people are bitching about when it came to the plot. And no, I ain't giving away the ending, you have to watch the movie for that. It's a basic tale of a small band of heroes that meet up under different circumstances and decide to team up to defeat a villain that threatens the entire human race.

Martial Arts Choreography is something to talk about. When you watch an episode of either Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, or Dragon Ball GT, you expect fast paced, lighting quick punches and kicks and waves upon waves of destructive energy being fired from a persons hand, eyes, and even the mouth. In Dragon Ball Evolution, the closest your gonna get to energy shooting is a ball, and the action scenes are not quick like in Dragon Ball, Z, or even GT. That doesn't mean that the fight scenes are horrible. The fight scenes are really good, you can probably compare them to the first Matrix movie when Neo practiced Kung Fu.

The special affects are nothing special. They look like something out of an XBOX cutscene. No, not an XBOX 360 cutscene, an XBOX cutscene. They're not bad, but they could have done so much better with the technology we had and still have what with the amount of CGI we have in movies now. Looks like something out of Windows movie maker. But since this movie is entirely a fantasy-scifi-action, I would let it slide for that reason.

Being faithful to the source material is fairly tame. I mean yeah, they got the story, the characters, but if your able to get the references like how Gokus hoodie have the same color scene as his Gi in the manga and anime, his hair won't stay down despite putting gel on it, and even having the joke of Master Roshis first name actually being `Master'. If you're like me, you'll like the little things they had as references and will like the things they were able to keep in the movie. My one huge gripe with it are the ways they pronounce Gohans name ""Go-han' and not ""Go-Haun"" and they chant the Kamehameha wrong, being ""Kame. Hame. Ha."" instead of ""Ka. Me. Ha. Me. Ha.""

Do I recommend this? Yes. Sure, the movie has a s*** tone of nit picky moments in them like the way they pronounce the names and such, but there are a lot of things that are good about this film. Even as a movie by itself and not being based off of Dragon Ball Z or just Dragon Ball, it's really good. This movie is your standard popcorn film.",1364601600,2,5227,4.446764091858038

3631499,4,B001HN69AE,"I'll preface my review by making a few initial points: I am not a die-hard Dragonball fan but I am an anime fan and have, over the course of many years, caught much of the series. I enjoy the series and love the mythology and characters but yes, I am one of those people who got a bit bogged down in the filler. Back in high-school and college I had many friends who lived and died by Dragonball Z. I completely understand that as there are series that I am like that with. I make this point because I think I'm actually the target audience even though that would seem contrary to making a movie based on anime with a huge following.

My friends (the big Dragonball Z fans) and a few of the people I overheard in the theater (could also tell they were huge Dragonball Z fans) absolutely hated this movie. I get that and I respect that and here's why. I think DBZ fans even more than some other fans (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc) hold this series very very dear and expect it to live up to the standard of the anime mainly because this is a series that takes an investment (both in time and money) to call yourself a die-hard fan. There are hundreds of episodes to watch and this series has been repacked many, many, MANY times especially in America and many of those fans have repurchased it every time. That's a huge commitment and they expected to see a return on that investment. But that's not what they received.

This movie is most definitely a reboot of the mythos. I mentioned Smallville in my review title and I think that pretty much sums it up. When Smallville started I was a little put off by the changes they made but by Season 10 I was sad to see it go. This is Dragonball if it were a teen sci-fi drama. But it's also one of the only retellings this story has had. Superman has had many incarnations. So has Batman, the X-Men and any number of other superheroes. But Goku and his pals have pretty much only had one. Sure there is the manga and the anime and there are differences but it's still that same core story. This is a fanbase who haven't really had a retelling and for some, that's a big pill to swallow.

I'm not going to say this is a perfect movie. It's predictable, it does make some odd choices even for a reboot and a few of the performances are a little stiff (I thought Chow Yun-Fat's Roshi was pretty standout and really seemed to have fun with the role, James Marsters's Piccolo was also good and appropriately stiff I thought but then again I love James Marsters and Piccolo was always one of my favorite characters) but it also makes some good nods to the original in telling it's rebooted story (even though Roshi is in the city he manages to live on an island, Goku still has a big appetite, etc). Overall this is a fun, family-friendly, fast-paced and exciting movie with some very good action...it's just not for Dragonball Z fans.

And that's one final distinction I'll make. I've tried to be careful where I typed ""Dragonball"" and where I typed ""Dragonball Z"" (hopefully I didn't mix up) because this isn't an adaptation of the more hyper-kinetic action-packed Dragonball Z which I think disappointed many of those fans. Granted this is again a reboot and changing canon but this is definitely an adaptation of the first, more adventure-based series. I know there are many many fans who are fans of all the series but I also know people who are fans of Z and really don't care much for the original series or GT because it wasn't as fight-based as Z is and I wonder how those who are fans of the whole franchise (as opposed to mostly Z-focused) approached this movie. My older brother was a big fan of Z and had seen some of the original and GT and was a little let down by the movie but still thought it was kinda fun and when I got him to look at the movie in the light of not being based off of Z he actually agreed with me and saw it in a better light.

It's a shame it didn't do well and didn't get to continue. I've read recent interviews where some of the actors kinda felt like the movie was laughable. Even in Japan it was seen as kind of a joke and isn't held in high regard but again, I get that. This is a series that is probably one of, if not THE most important and influential anime series EVER and I get wanting to treat it like the Bible. Completely understand. But I think some fans may have warmed to this Smallville-esque retelling of events and may would have even had some fun seeing the more familiar, action-oriented Z storylines told in a new light. Ah well.

Bottom line: if you're a casual Dragonball or anime fan, you'll probably like this or if you're looking for a good, okay for the whole family action-adventure story then give it a try.",1358985600,,4710,4.31638418079096

In my opinion:

DragonBall Evolution... I was trying hard to see where the movie fit in, and it just does not. If they made it like the main actor was a Saiyan (just not Goku, or a known character) then the story could have been twisted and turned because it would have been original and wouldn't have tampered with an existing one (though this film doesn't change that story). Instead, DragonBall was thrown into a blender giving small bits of familiarity with a lot of cheesy unknown ""what the heck is this"" content, wrapped in a (Made for Syfy, yet ended up at the box office) film with a reputable ""DragonBall"" bow tied around it.

If you don't think about the name, and you enjoy ""Made for TV films""... its not extremely bad (though it is cheesy), that's why I've given it a 2 out of 5 stars.",1355616000,2,1073,4.266009852216749

If they were reviewing this movie then I think they would give it at least 4 stars and probably 5.

I'm not a 15-year-old boy (...well, kinda at heart) but I do enjoy martial arts and fantastical movies and this has both of those elements in it with a lot of special effects and Mr. Hardboiled himself, Chow Yun Fat (that was a big surprise).  For what it seems to be (a live action fantasy based upon the Dragonball Z anime & manga) it was enjoyable but unspectacular.  The leads of Goku and the girl he's crushing on, Chi Chi, are both likable and both bring ample physicality to their roles.  Goku is the would-be savior of the world when some green-skinned conqueror named Piccolo (isn't that a musical instrument?) comes to call.  There are some decent action moments and bright visuals.  The attractive but too-old-for-the-role Emmy Rossum plays a screwball-ish character and feels out of place but other than this the movie comes off as otherwise harmless Saturday morning cartoon fare turned live action.

Adults who don't like Saturday morning cartoons would probably not be looking at this in the first place and would be better served watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".

3631518,1,B001HN69AE,"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of Dragonball, Dragonball Z, or any other things having to do with Dragonballs. No hate, just not a fan.

So when I saw ""Dragonball: Evolution,"" all I knew about the series was what I gleaned from wikis and Abridged Series... and I STILL found plenty to mock and criticize. This movie is an incoherent mess with no real motivations or plot -- fans will be frothing at the mouth at the stuff it changes, and non-fans will be completely baffled.

On his eighteenth birthday, high-school outcast/martial artist Goku (Justin Chatwin) is given a magical Dragonball by his grandfather Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). But when he returns home from a party, Goku finds that Gohan has been murdered by the evil demon Piccolo (James Marsters), who is trying to gather all the Dragonballs so he can... do something.

Like any good Obi-Wan, Gohan's dying message is to find somebody to finish Goku's training. So Goku joins forces with the eccentric Master Roshi (Chow-Yun Fat), along with the Dragonball-obsessed Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum) and desert bandit Yamcha (Joon Park). This little group must gather all the Dragonballs before the eclipse, or Piccolo will... do something.

""Dragonball Evolution"" is a great example of why live adaptations of anime don't turn out well -- not faithful enough to satisfy Dragonball fans, but too esoteric for newcomers. But even if that weren't true, the movie would still be a mess -- it feels like nobody cared enough to do more than slap everything hastily together.

Almost nothing is explained (like Piccolo's motives). Instead it just coasts along, hoping that the splashes of CGI and wacky acting will distract you from the incoherent plot. And in a futile attempt to appeal to teenagers, it inserts random High School Wangst, in a baffling subplot that has Goku being bullied and mooning after Chi-Chi.

I'd also like to mention that it has several characters that have no reason to be in this movie except... well, that they existed in the manga. Ernie Hudson, Emmy Rossum, Joon Park and Jamie Chung all do decent jobs, but they are utterly wasted.

And the actors who AREN'T superfluous are totally wasted too. Chow Yun-fat acts like he's gone off his bipolar meds, although there's a certain hammy charm in his performance. And Poor James Marsters is stuck in green makeup, with no motivation except ""Piccolo's evil! And he wants the Dragonballs for... uh... no reason!""

And Chatwin? The less said about him, the better. He's your typical pouting teen loser who Doesn't Fit In, which makes him an awful lead character.

""Dragonball Evolution"" is a prime example of why Hollywood should stay far, far away from anime and manga -- a baffling, annoying slagheap that won't make anyone happy.",1350604800,2,2749,4.907327586206897

Now if you watch this movie and you are a fan like me than you will be INSANELY disappointed and angry. They really take a great amazing anime and spit on it, with annoying hollywood influences and annoying actors. The acting is pretty cheesy and the fighting is mediocre, however the special FX was pretty cool. If you erase from your mind that there is no such thing as an anime then i give the movie a 0.5 out of 5, but as a movie inspired by the anime? well its certainly gets a 0 out of 5, the movie is pretty awful and i am happy it did not do well. The acting;again, is terrible and i felt like the Dragon Ball i loved so much was murdered right in front of my eyes. This movie shouldn't be $5 because there are great $5 movies out there, this movie ""Dragon Ball Evolution"" should be $1 or less. Honestly, if you are considering buying this movie DON'T DO IT! it's not worth your important time and money! if you want to see it badly find a way to watch it for free because the money you pay for this movie could be money spent on a beautiful bottle of root beer and chips.

Both movies completely ruin the cartoon. they're a disgrace to the cartoon and they both shouldn't have been made.

Now, i saw this movie a long time ago and if i remember right, goku is in school, i remember him learning how to use ki and shut or opened all the lockers, i don't remember which. . . Why is goku in school to begin with? i remember being excited for this movie to come out. i was so excited to see and the ki blasts like kamehameha and galick gun. but if i recall right there was none of that except like 2 blasts at the end.
I loved the anime. i grew up LOVING the anime, i even spent $40-$45 on each of the 9 dragonball z seasons, 5 of the dragonball seasons, and 2 of the dragonball gt seasons. i even went out and bought all the steel cover movies for like $20 each, point is im a huge fan! and this movie left me disappointed. i love the cartoon so much im even trying to get my girl friend into it since she has no idea what dragonball z is. The movie consists of a lot of shock wave things when goku is learning ki, even though they never do that in the cartoon. now i don't remember much from the movie, but that just shows how awful it is if im a huge fan and don't even remember the only movie that came out. buy the seasons first, don't buy this movie, its as awful as the last airbender",1326672000,2,1453,3.993127147766323

For one, ChiChi was completely neutered.  Her overbearing personality was no where to be seen.  Instead she was this empowered modern chick that displayed a lot of confidence.  Another thing that stood out was Master Roshi and the fact that he dropped Bulma after grabbing her ass.  He wouldn't have done that - he would have groped (and giggled like a school girl) as long as she would let him.

The biggest disappointment was the total lack of confidence that Goku displayed.  That is one of Goku's defining characteristics - nothing gets him down and he's an eternal optimist.  And they made him a cheater!  I could probably go on all night with everything that was just wrong with this movie (they didn't get a single character right), but I don't want to waste any more time on this movie.

Seriously, if you're a fan of the cartoon series, DO NOT WATCH THIS.  You'll just end up disappointed.

Oh yeah, one last thing - WITH were the fights scenes.  Dragon Ball is known to have amazing fights and they were totally missing from the movie.  The only, remotely interesting, skirmish involved a few jocks and Goku never throws a punch.  He does nothing but dodge.",1305331200,,1366,5.17351598173516

Poorly chosen actors, they didn't even try to finds actors that would resemble the anime characters.  Let's pick a pretty girl, put a tiny streak of blue on her hair and call her Bulma.  Let's get a famous martial artist and call him Master Roshi (No white hair, no beard, not HALF the dirty old man).  I think the part of the movie that angered me the most is when they called Goku's signature move the Kame-hame-ha!  WTF?!  That is how he calls out the attack as he charges and fires it.  It is called the Kamehameha wave (like Hawaii's King Kamehameha).  All the people involved in writing, producing and creating this movie should be drug out into the middle of the street and shot.

3631611,2,B001HN69AE,"Let's get obvious out of the way: It's a complete failure as an adaptation of the manga/anime. Now I'm not someone that needs a film adaptation to stick to the source material one hundred percent because I know that's impossible (adaptations that try to do that usually come off as lifeless or stale). However, beyond using elements from the manga and anime, the film doesn't really have much ties to the original material at all. The entire backstories of Piccolo and Goku are almost entirely changed as are their personalities and motivations.  Most importantly, the spirit of the show is abandoned in an attempt to fit the film into a more commercial - familiar - package, which leads to this film's second biggest problem: There's not an original idea to be found.

Sure, Star Wars and The Matrix borrowed from other source materials but they used those things to tell their stories in a unique way. Dragonball Evolution, however, uses ideas from other films and vomits them out in the exact same way they went in. Everything from Spider-Man (a geek with super powers wants the hottest girl in school) to B-level Kung Fu films (finding your chi, being one with yourself, etc.) are ripped off without shame, preventing the film from having any sort of identity. This wouldn't bother me so much if this were an original screenplay - Technically, every idea has been done before - but the fact that this film has source material to draw from, yet uses all these worn out cliches in its place, is what ultimately makes this film such a failure. That's not to say the film doesn't have other faults, though, because its lack of originality wouldn't stick out so much without some other serious issues.

The production value screams that this film was shot on the cheap. The sets looked crammed, there's not much various in terms of lighting, the fight scenes lack any type of flair and the special effects don't create any sense of wonder whatsoever. As for the acting, Chatwin is a surprisingly likable Goku and does the best with what he's given (unfortunately, that isn't very much). The other performances range from being non-existent (James Marsters as Piccolo) to over the top (Emma Rossum's super serious Bulma and Chow Yun Fat's overcooked Roshi). Then there's Ernie Hudson's performance, which is just too hard to define (what the hell made him do this?). Coming back to the plot, the fact that it's never explained exactly how Piccolo got released from his prison clearly proves that not a lot of thought was put into this film's story. I could also go into how no tension or antagonistic relationship is built between Goku and Piccolo to make their fight at the end mean something... but that's another review in and of itself.

Despite everything I just said (or really because of what I just said), the reason I gave the film two stars is because it's pretty harmless on its own merits. It passes the time if you have nothing else to do and since it was a bomb in theaters, it won't create much of a negative perception of the Dragonball franchise as a whole. Hell, Fox could make a reboot of Dragonball right away and people wouldn't notice because nobody saw this film (DB fans and non-fans alike). In its own little way, it's actually entertaining... as a guilty pleasure. Still, avoiding it is the best option because there are far too many genuinely good films to be watched.",1290556800,3,3393,4.726351351351352
3631612,3,B001HN69AE,"For one, I got this movie for $1 in a bargain bin in a local store, I figured if its bad..it doesnt matter. I paid almost nothing for it. Now the movie was ok at best, with some good action but its what you would expect when an American movie company tries to make a movie based on an anime from Japan. Nothing really that special. It had its moments..mainly bad...but enjoyable.",1290211200,,379,4.277777777777778
3631613,3,B001HN69AE,"Ok, lets cut to the chase REAL quick. This movie struggles in SO many ways. If you are an avid Dragon Ball fan you will not like this movie at all. period. There are so many derivations and differences between the anime and the movie that you most likely won't be able to stomach more than a half-hour of it. If you have no awareness of the anime the story WILL be confusing and many of the plot elements won't add up at all.
 So this puts Dragonball Evolution between a rock and a hard place. It can't appeal to its fan base because it doesn't even try to match things up very well, which it technically doesn't ever intend to being a outspoken ""evolution""(derivation) movie, and it can't appeal to newcomers because it simply won't make sense.

So does it have any appeal at all? It you are under 12 yes! Seriously this is a movie that a kid can really enjoy. Its PG rating has kept it almost completely free of language, blood, and innuendo and the action is steady throughout. Most kids (especially boys) will get a kick out of the ki-balls being shot around and the crazy choreography. Will it appeal to anyone else? If you can tap into the 12 year old inside, reduce your expectations of oscar winning performances and strict Dragonball cannon adherence, and just enjoy a silly, fun, action movie, than heck yes.

I'm wondering if any person on this movie has even heard of Dragonball before signing on to it. Besides not following the series, the acting and special effects really do not deliver. The KamiHamiHa looks as bad as a scene fromt the Last Airbender. This movie does raise some questions that fans of the Dragonball series have. Why is Goku white with an asian grandfather? Why is Piccolo portrayed as being thousands of years old? How can Goku become the Oozaru without his tail? Why is Piccolo foreign to Goku when in the series Goku defeated him when Goku was a child? Why does Master Roshi not have his beard and bald head? That's the problem with these anime made-to-real-life movies. You simply cannot take a series that has so many episodes/sagas and cram it into a 90 minute flick. It seems that this movie was only made for kids/teenagers who don't understand the Dragonball series.

And so I did, and I was horribly disappointed.  The entire story is quite original to those who have no background in Asian comic book stories, and I won't go into the details here, but everything else was horrible.  First of, why is the main character a white man when the setting is in Asia, and the main character's father is Oriental?  Second, why do all these Hollywood produced movies have to have the white man pick up the hot chinese babe in the movie?  Why not the other way around?  And why did Chow-Yun Fat sign up for this movie?  His role was utterly ridiculous.  Worst of all was the kung fu fighting.  It had all the apparent use of special effects, high-wire stunts, and second-by-second choreography, without any of the spirit, drama or tension seen in the Hong Kong-made martial arts movies.

But, you cannot watch this movie expecting it to be a faithful recreation of Dragon Ball, the animated series. If you're expecting to see the animated series in the form of a movie, you'll be disappointed like the majority of reviewers on here.

I've seen many (of the seemingly thousands!) of Dragonball episodes and movies over the years, and I really liked the way they created this live version. They made some small changes to the story and some characters that I'm familiar with, but I thought the changes made sense in putting together a 90-minute movie. I especially like the change they made to Chi Chi. She's now extremely cute and not at all the screeching banshee that she mostly is in the cartoon series. I thought the casting was great all around, and even though Chow Yun-fat looks nothing like Master Roshi from the cartoon, it's Chow Yun-fat for cryin' out loud! He gets to play whatever part he wants! Emmy Rossum as Bulma!? Perfect! I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays Piccollo, but again, perfect! Anyway, I'm enjoying writing this goofy review in the same way I enjoyed watching this and pretty much every Dragonball episode I've seen. Its a very simple story, lots of great action and just a fun time all around. I thought the special effects and the look of the film were great and I'm really sorry that they most likely won't be doing a series of Dragonball films. I would have loved to see Vegeta throwing down. That would have been a blast! Or Frieza! Who's up for some world-shattering combat?!!

Ahem. Anyway, to get a hold of my inner child for a moment, This is just a really fun film. They did a good job of bringing the characters and feel of Dragonball to life and I really hope to see all these actors reprise their roles in many more Dragonball films. Come on! Make it happen!

3631657,2,B001HN69AE,"Talk about absurdity, but of what I'm not sure: was it due to the most powerful being on Earth going to high school and getting ridiculous by hand-me-down bullies, or was it that I watched that scene straight-faced?  In actuality, the thing that crossed my mind was, ""how could a high school in the suburbs be close to a secluded hut on top of a hill where Goku lived""?  I don't understand the inclusion of having a high-school setting in the first place; as a Dragonball enthusiast, that seems more suited for a character like Gohan.  Gohan went to high-school and he goes through the same awkward stages like Justin Chatwin's character.  In fact, Chatwin acted more like Gohan than Goku: Goku has always been a naive but kind-hearted character with a large appetite, not nebbish and cowardice towards girls like Chatwin portrayed. His love-interest, Chi-Chi, is more of a flirt than a hot-tempered lady of the original and thus is a lot less interested.  The actors don't seem too thrilled with their performances, with the exception of Chow Yun-Fat who manages to mantain his Muten Roshi character with most of the original perversion and radical temperament intact.

If anyone doesn't know what the Dragon Ball series is about, the you'll be completely flabbergasted by how contrived and ridiculous the whole movie sets up, but even if one's an avid Dragon Ball fan, the plot for ""Dragonball Evolution"" still wouldn't make sense.  It narrates about an evil nemesis named Piccolo who's a destroyer of planets alongside a giant ape, until he was locked in a cage but he was uncaged and is off to follow his clich.  The film never bothered to explain how he got out, it's just an excuse to drive the ""stop the big big"" plot for Goku to go on the merry journey, as well as finding the dragonball with help of his allies. Who is that woman Piccolo's hanging with and how did they meet?  There's an explanation among elders about Goku's eighteenth birthday and how it relates to the plot, but how would the elders know about it?  How come the missing dragon balls are so close to each other in the search?  Other plot-related questions that I can't spoil, but the point is almost every situation seemed to be set-up simply out of convenience without any kind of logical explanation behind them.

If I have anything good to say, the fight scenes aren't bad, although the climatic showdown between Goku and Piccolo ended on a total letdown.  But when it comes to a paper-full-of-holes plot, boring characters, and cartoony effects, saying ""fights aren't bad"" isn't good enough.  It's just another lousy effort on a live-action anime adaptation.",1275696000,,2640,4.786343612334802

3631722,1,B001HN69AE,"As a hardcore fan of the DragonBall series, I felt it was my duty to review and report the epic failures that made up the live-action DragonBall movie, DragonBall Evolution. I would write SPOILER ALERT, but let's be honest, the movie's pretty much spoiled as it is.

Here is the good:

1. Master Roshi is wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
2. Master Roshi is still a pervert.
3. The Dragonballs look pretty amazing.
4. Chi-chi is pretty HOT.

That's about all. Here are 35 inconsistencies, failures, and generally speaking, crap found in the movie. Some of these are painstakingly obvious flaws, yet they must be mentioned:

1. Goku has no tail.
2. Goku goes to high school.
3. Goku hits puberty.
4. Chi-chi isn't the innocent little girl as we know in the series; in fact, she's a bit of a tramp.
5. ""Air bending"" is a misnomer used to describe ki energy waves.
6. Kamehameha waves can heal people.
7. Piccolo has Darth Vader powers.
8. Piccolo wears some sort of body armor.
9. Master Roshi is not old, nor bald.
10. World Martial Arts tournaments take place in a sumo wrestling arena.
11. Capsules operate with remotes...and no, there is no magical cloud with ""POOF!"" written out that appears.
12. There are no furry, talking animals.
13. Additionally, the setting is modern day Earth, unlike the anime which takes place in an alternate reality that is an amalgam of prehistoric times and the future.
14. The Eternal Dragon is a wispy, cloud. He can neither talk nor pass sarcastic comments.
15. The mention of ""Namek"" is an anachronism.
16. Piccolo somehow knows that Goku can tranform into Oozaru.
17. Solar eclipses make Goku go Ape-form.
18. The special effects are pathetic for Michael Bay's standards. In fact, the final fight evoked painfully supressed memories of Power Ranger action sequences.
19. Goku doesn't need incentives to blast awesome Kamehameha waves. In fact, he isn't supposed need anyone to teach it to him.
20. Chi-chi clone?!?! What the hell?
21. Grandpa Gohan is killed when a house collapses on him. This is retarded for three reasons. Gohan's supposed to be dead in DB. Gohan is killed by Oozaru form Goku. Gohan is one of the strongest in DB, but no, he dies because a house collapses on him.
22. There is an over-emphasis on the use of guns.
23. Bulma does not have blue hair, instead she has wispy blue highlights
24. Kame House is still located on an island. But the island is in New York City. Don't ask.
25. Capsule Corp vehicles are transformer robots.
26. The Power Pole is seen with Goku, yet he never uses it.
27. There is no Nimbus Cloud, which is the classic icon of DragonBall next to the Power Pole.
28. Apparently Goku has super-elastic clothes.
29. The clothing is too modern, especially for Goku who only wears training clothes in the anime.
30. Bulma's objective is to use the Dragonballs to harness energy. In the series, her wish was for a boyfriend.
31. Goku is insecure and a bit of a weiner.
32. The action was very un-Dragonball-esque.

The special effects were good, the action scenes were fun and there were alot of funny scenes.  For a sub two hour movie, they introduced all of the characters and the basic concept of the dragonballs. I've seen episodes of the cartoon before but I never really got into it.  Seeing it urged me to watch them and find out more about the story like how Goku got there 18 years ago and what happened with Piccolo that he wants revenge on the planet.

3631791,1,B001HN69AE,"Dragonball Evolution is the worst movie ever. I would have rated it Zero, except this site won't let you do that.

It is not a Dragonball movie. It simply has Dragonball in the name, like that Final Fantasy Spirits Without or whatever. If Dragonball Evolution is a movie adaptation of the Dragonball anime/manga, than ""Time Cop"" must be the live action adaptation of the Jungle Book.

You may lose sight in your left ear if you watch this movie, I know, that may not make much sense, but it is true. It's like a 2 hour episode of Power Rangers, except far less entertaining. It is an ABC Family TV movie with a $100 million dollar budget. It is often mistakenly categorized as ""Sci Fi"" or ""Fantasy"", it is really a Drama loosely based on the true story of Koko, the gorilla who can talk with sign language.

If I had to rate this movie on special effects purely, I'd give it 4 stars.
- Half star is for the outdated computer graphics, Yamcha's blonde highlights, the 6 foot man in a gorilla suit, and the christmas light bulbs in the Dragonballs.
- Half star for the Capsules, and bullet time at the castle, that actually was pretty well done. And the girl that plays Chi Chi is hot.
- Three stars for the innovative ""smell"" technique only found in this movie: you actually can smell sweaty butt cheeks coming out of your sound system. I know! This movie is that bad!

There is actually one movie that comes close to being worse than Dragonball Evolution. It is called ""Paranormal Activity"". Except that Paranormal Activity does not meet the text-book definition of a ""movie"", it is simply what can only be described as ""moving pictures"". Sometimes experts refer to it as an ""un-animated feature"". So therefore Dragonball Evolution is considered the worst movie ever.",1263168000,15,1767,4.617834394904459

I have to say I did like the first wish better, for that thank goodness for no Oolong and how DBE made ChiChi to be a very strong woman, even though this is seen in DB/Z/GT but to not as strong degree.

I do hope however in the second one it is more canon, ie Bulma's hair is blue (like her streaks) or magna purple and it is more canon, and more japanese like than american.

My kids are big fans of the Anime series and they hated this movie with the passion.

During the movie, My kids asked me, ""We want to go home mommy, this is not Dragonball"". I told them ok, and told them I totaly agreed with them, it wasn't Dragonball. I talked to the manager before we left the theater demanding a full refund. He gladly give me my money back with out any problem. I Was happy he did because this movies was no where near worth the $50.00, I dished out to see this movie. I used that money to take the kids out to eat instead. I should of done this in the first place then taking my kids to see this crap of a movie.

If they are going to transfer these type of Anime movies over to the big screen. They really need to do their home work first before they start making anything. I couldn't believe how badly this movie turned out with all the material they have on Dragonball.

It wasn't made for the fans or the hardcore fanatics.

Dragonball is one of those movies that was made just to for the money, nothing else. Getting kids to think they are seeing what they want but turns out it isn't. But the directors still make a profit even it it's a bad movie.

It's sad to see where they are taking movies now a days. I do recommended reading reviews first before dishing out money. -=Kaity=-",1261872000,11,1568,4.175496688741722

Determined that Hollywood will never get what made those series so great in the first place in the movies.  Dragonball: Evolution is certainly no exception. I was one of those few that remained optimistic about the movie. I'll admit, fans have a right to be upset that the people who made this movie took liberties in making the movie, not adhering to the original DBZ series storyline and whatnot. They also have the right to be unhappy that the production values were pretty low-budget. I, too, was expecting something pretty spectacular in that department as the anime is pretty wild.

Yet, even so--on its' own merits, I still thought the movie was entertaining. Personally, I enjoyed it. My thoughts on things are that, if they made this movie exactly like the anime series, it would be pretty pointless. Why would fans even bother to go see it at all. Honestly, I've been a fan of the series since it first aired years ago and I wouldn't see it if it were exactly the same. Second, maybe they didn't have enough money to make the production values any better. I hear tell that a sequel is already in the works. If so, maybe they'll get things right this time all the way around. That way, casual fans and hardcore fans alike will feel the same way about the movie.",1261094400,,1418,4.623015873015873
3631798,2,B001HN69AE,"I approached the film Dragonball with no preconception of the Dragonball franchise, and evaluated it as a film.  American teenager Goku is depicted as an outcast of sorts in high school, for his unusual background (lives with asian grandpa, rides a scooter when everyone else has a car, etc.).  And he is head over heels for a asian girl named Chi-Chi.  Basically, you need to approach the film as a typical boy-saves-the-world kind of film, that just happened to have names and backdrop of the Dragonball manga/anime franchise.

Another way of looking at the film is that it became ""Americanized.""  It's not an unusual approach.  For example, the anime show Cardcaptor Sakura was shown on TV years ago, in English track, with Americanized names and dialogue.  I think Twentieth Century Fox, the movie studio that produced this film, figured that having an Americanized version of Dragonball as a film would be profitable, and draw consumer interest from fans of the anime/manga franchise.  Of course, interest was drawn, along with boos and bad reviews from disappointed fans over this Americanization.

The film itself is mediocre.  I don't think the plot was fleshed out enough to create a decent story.  Goku basically goes from one quest to another, in search for all seven Dragonballs, and defeat Piccolo.  The director tries to make the film interesting with all the fight scenes, and special effects.  But the fight sequences seem to stutter in a go-and-halt like fashion, rather than run smoothly.  Compare the fight scenes in this film with that of Mortal Combat, for example, and you'll see exactly what I mean.

In my view, Dragaonball: Evolution is not the worst film of the year, as many reviewers proclaim in their reviews here.  But it is certainly a disappointing one.",1260057600,,1785,4.97972972972973

3631851,1,B001HN69AE,"I've been a diehard fan of the series since I first saw it on Cartoon Network all those years ago. When I heard about a live action movie coming soon (I first heard in 2002 or 2003 thru a magazine published by Beckett), I was estatic. I was expecting a huge cast with big name stars to play the characters of the most popular and succesful anime of all time.

This movie shouldn't even carry the rights to Dragonball. It was nothing like it. Let's start off with characters.

Goku - He likes girls? Wait, what? In the anime, he didn't even know what the difference between a boy and a girl was. He married Chi-Chi without even knowing what marriage was, and school? What school? Where's the always hungry, gullible, naive Goku we've grown to love? The actor who plays him isn't the first I would pick to play Goku anyway. Ugh.

Krillin - What the hell? Where is Goku's best friend Krillin? How do you do a dragonball adaptation without him?

Bulma - One of the finer points of the movie. The actress who plays Bulma is gorgeous, just like Bulma should be. Still, they did away with the blue hair, and gave her a blue streak?

Master Roshi - Reminds me NOTHING of the Master Roshi from the anime. I mean absolutuly nothing like the original Roshi.

Other small annoying little changes... Where are the talking animals? Roshi's turtle, Oolong, Puar? How about Yamcha being deathly afraid of girls, especially when he met Bulma. The Kamehameha was WEAK, it looked horrible. Goku only wears the classic Orange Gi, for about 5 minutes on-screen. Y'know the movie is going to be bad, when the best fight scene in the movie is near the beginning with high school kids. Wow.

So, if you're looking for a movie true to the anime. This is not it. You will be extremely dissapointed. Now, in an attempt at pretending I know nothing of Dragonball, and was watching and hearing everything for the first time...It's still horrible. You'll just have less reason to dislike it, than the fans.",1258934400,15,1976,4.549295774647887

Every single bit that is awesome in the comics, anime and games is missing.

DB is about fighting guys and not a highschool romance story between Goku and Chichi.

I specially enjoyed the character Chi-chi. The reason for giving a 3 is that the story was a bit simple and the build-up to the big closing scene was too easy; perhaps this is a side effect of using a manga as your basis.

3631901,1,B001HN69AE,"I don't know where to begin on the reasons why I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I am a huge Dragonball fan and it has nothing to offer the fans of the series. As for new people watching it I would still go against it. So Goku is being trained by Gohan who found him in his yard trying to prepare him for the possible return of Piccolo who is from the planet Namek and according to this movie all Nameks are evil. When Goku turns 18 he has the possibility of changing into a demon named Osaru which is his great ape form. Goku never has a tail in this movie period. Everyone he meets knows martial arts in this movie except for Bulma and Yamcha. Bulma makes inventions still, but other than that she is a complete idiot. I don't get how she makes anything in the movie. The Dragon Radar also got changed to the DBE for Dragon Ball Energy. The ancient Dragon Balls also seem to have no rhyme or reason for how they actually ended up on the planet. Oh finally Goku could become the Avatar since the Kamehameha in this movie is a form of airbending though it can light things on fire.

So I mentioned why you should avoid it so far just by being a fan of the original series. Well the plot makes no sense. Osaru and Piccolo were defeated 2,000 years ago and now Piccolo is on a rampage looking for the Dragon Balls. They don't explain how Piccolo returned and Osaru came from the sky 18 years ago so he just happens to be their to help. Osaru as mentioned above is Goku, but they don't really explain why he has a human form at all. He can only change during a Solar Eclipse which is a rare event and if he isn't in his Osaru form, well he's a good guy. That means his transformation should only last a limited time at best. Goku however can fight the transformation which also is not really explained well, but you see him just change back because he wants to. The acting is horrible and if they stuck with the original story were Goku is only 12, a 12 year old could have done a better job. Bulma's actress is by far the worse of the actors in the movie and she even sounds like an idiot. She also doesn't have any common sense and yet she has like a Phd and all of this other stuff in the movie.

Just do yourself a favor even if you are just curious about how bad this movie is and don't watch it. If someone asks you too and it's free to watch it once, don't do it. I got that opportunity and I still feel like I was ripped off. I want my time back.",1253664000,9,2463,4.076288659793814
3631902,2,B001HN69AE,"Okay, how about a review and not a rant?

Dragonball, the Manga turned Anime was a lot of things but mostly it was zany. Filled with corny charm thanks to Akira Toriyama's sense of humor it followed the adventures of a young, precocious and extremely self-assured adventurous young boy named Goku and the friends he meets and makes along the way.

This movie, sadly, is really none of those things. Here we have a teen-aged Goku that is forced into the Hollywood-esque cookie cutter of powerful teenage boy that lacks self-confidence and must deal with bullies in High-school, albeit in a slightly different way than we're used to. He's not scared he just tries very hard to do as his Grandfather wishes. Okay, this is for fans to complain about but what about someone seeing it for the first time?

Where this film's version of Goku fails is the sometimes on-again off-again confidence of Goku. One scene he is pensive the next he is arrogant.

At times the script contradicted itself through its characters regarding major story elements, i.e. Prometheus Globe / Dragon Ball(s).

Bulma and her guns. I don't remember Bulma ever being a female Mod version of Dirty Harry? Odd choice considering this film felt as if it was geared towards 5-10 year old American kids.

Okay, some cons overall:

Capsule technology: Did we really need more Transformer-esque morphing vehicles with their heavily angular design? It seems this movie could have actually borrowed from Akira Toriyama's designs and gave it a unique look with new and unique CGI effects to marvel at. Instead we got the same old, same old.

The story was relatively dull and oozed ""I've seen this done better"" feel throughout. It didn't feel inspired in anyway. While the performances were generally good (or at least serviceable) the only real stand-out was Joon Park as Yamcha. Despite some character changes, he acted and sounded very much like the source character and carried a charisma that felt lacking from the other actors.

Considering this film is actually filled with talented actors that have carried other films quite competently, I can only blame the director for what seems to be a lack of charisma and cohesion between characters overall.

Some fan specific complaints

1.) Almost completely ignored the source material and altered some of the plot that completely changes these characters potential future.

2.) The Heavy, Piccolo, played by James Marsters was virtually non-existent in this film and when he was in a scene he was forgettable. Very odd considering Marsters stands out in just about every other thing he has done.

3.) Goku in High School? Yikes. It goes without saying that this character was altered so much as to become a different character completely yet going by the same name. What I found most odd regarding how they changed Goku is that the Original pre-teen Goku (from the Manga/Anime) appealed to me greatly. I remember thinking, ""Wow! This kid is self reliant and not afraid of anything! I wish I was that way!"" And hence, I fell in love with the character. This film's sort of ""everyman"" Goku came off as very dull.

4.) The man sized Oozaru as Goku's transformation form. Huh? Man-sized? While it/he looked kind of cool for live action, he was just the size of a big man.

5.) Akria Toriyama's sense of humor was SORELY missing in this film.

6.) This Earth was simply a future version of our own. Gone was the alternate Earth from the manga/anime and its unique culture/geography, art design and almost allegorical/fairy-tale feel.

7.) This film isn't even 90 minutes long? Very strange considering Dragon Ball and DBZ always carried a very epic (in some cases too epic) feel to them.

I could go on (and on and on, actually) but I think I've blustered enough. If you are a fan of the Manga and/or Anime as I am, do yourself a favor and don't bother.

If you're new to Dragon Ball, go out and rent the Anime, it is one of Akira Toriyama's visions (the other and probably more pure is the Manga) and is by far superior to this film despite its later episode flaws.

If you are looking to entertain a group of 5-10 year olds, this movie is MEH at best and you would do better renting/buying any number of other films or better yet the original Anime.",1253577600,2,4258,4.751696065128901
3631903,1,B001HN69AE,"Being unfamiliar with the graphic novels, anime, or video games that have made the Dragonball saga a world-wide sensation, I viewed ""Dragonball: Evolution"" with an open mind, hoping to see the kind of frenetic martial arts, magic, and humor I had enjoyed in ""Mortal Kombat"", a few years back. Well...""Mortal Kombat"" this ain't, and despite the presence of legendary ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" star, Chow Yun-Fat (who must have needed the paycheck), I can't recommend this turkey to anyone over the age of 4!

The plot is confusing; thousands (or 2,000) years ago, an insane demon lord, Piccolo (if somebody named me that, I'd be pretty mad, too), and his evil right-hand demon, Ozaru, nearly destroyed the world, until he was bound within the earth by seven sorcerors who gave their lives creating the mystical Dragonball orbs that focused their energies. Now, with a 'blood moon' total solar eclipse approaching, Piccolo (an unrecognizable James Marsters) is somehow free (how he accomplished that isn't explained), and gathering up the Dragonballs (which, together, according to legend, will allow the possessor the fulfillment of one 'perfect' wish). He plans to use it to release Ozaru, and finish what he started, before (uh, if any wish would be granted, why not simply WISH the job to be finished?)

Meanwhile, in true ""Karate Kid"" fashion, young Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being trained by his Asian grandfather (Randall Duk Kim) martial arts, and harnassing The Force (oops, I mean, his Ki). Goku's past is unknown to him (to be revealed on his 18th birthday), and to celebrate the birthday, Grandpa gives him a Dragonball (which flashes images of Ozaru to him). Of course, Goku cannot display his formidable skills to his high school classmates (even the hot Asian girl he secretly likes, Chi Chi, played by pretty Jamie Chung). With the violent death of the old man, Goku learns of Piccolo's quest, and races to gather all the Dragonballs, himself, joined by greedy Bulma (Emmy Rossum, who must have needed the paycheck, also), a thief, Yamcha (Joon Park), and happy-go-lucky Master, Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat). The story goes downhill, from here...First the Dragonballs are all-important, then they're not, then Chi Chi is revealed as a martial arts expert, who isn't very formidible, then (with very unimpressive CGI), Goku's 'secret' is revealed, but it turns out IT isn't that essential, anyway. The story keeps building to less-than-overwhelming climaxes, with a finale that had me wondering why I'd stuck with the film so long!

The Special Features are so-so (the gag reel is funny, an interview with Justin Chatwin doesn't really provide much more insight than a Google search, and a 'Making of' featurette of the Chi Chi vs. Chi Chi fight scene is informative, although the scene isn't the lynchpin of the movie that it is implied as).

""Dragonball: Evolution"" is a poor movie...skip it, you won't be missing anything!",1253577600,41,2936,5.0850622406639
3631904,3,B001HN69AE,"DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION

I have always been a fan of the Manga series Dragonball by Akira Toriyama and each series afterwards like Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT. I liked the written formats and the animes as well so I was excited when this live action film was announced. I was let down a bit when the trailer was released but I never judge without seeing something first. I missed the theatrical release because of reasons unknown to myself, as I did not know when it was out [limited I think could be wrong]. So when the DVD was released I had to see it so off I went with my girl and brother and sat down to hopefully enjoy.

Goku is just a normal every day average young man who has trouble fitting in and getting the girl of his dreams, and can fight like crazy. That of course is his only thing he has going for him but even then his grandfather can whoop him. Any way one day he is invited to Chi Chi's house for a party by her, the girl of his dreams. So after sneaking out and skipping on his tradition he does with his grandpa on his birthday he makes his way to Chi Chi's. Upon arriving a group of guys that usually pick on him are there to continue the torment, until he decides to teach them a lesson, with out throwing a blow. While doing this and impressing Chi Chi his grandfather is attacked by Piccolo an alien who is far more powerful than he is. Piccolo is after the Dragonballs and will stop at nothing to get them including killing all those who are in the way.

So after returning home Goku learns of this and is told by his dying grandfather to find a Master Roshi. From there Roshi can help him keep the Dragonballs safe and teach him to fight Piccolo. This journey to save the world will lead him on a crazy adventure that introduces him to characters such as the lovely Bulma and a guy named Yamcha. All three with the help of Master Roshi set out to find the Dragonballs and stop Piccolo before he can summon another creature that threatens the world.

Well even though that all sounds good the truth of the matter is it really is not the awesome extravaganza that it should have been. This film when first announced had me all kinds of crazy hyped, because for some reason I though they would take this serious enough to make it great. I can understand changing some things for the feature film to make it appeal to a wider audience but there are some things in this that are just, well not good shall we say. Director James Wong as taken a lot of flack for this film and for the most part rightly so, because as the team captain he should have been all over the mistakes in this. The direction at times feels uneven and at others a bit rushed if that makes any sense. At least the action is good but the biggest mistake is the fact that the final battle with Piccolo is way to short. Piccolo is a bad dude and at least they made him look cool in this even though the fight at the end could have been better.

Ben Ramsey messed up with this one; I don't know why he wrote it like this because he has done much better. He directed a recent film that I though was great called ""Blood & Bone"" and wrote one of my favorite films called ""The Big Hit"". Don't know what he was doing on this one, but oh well I guess. Acting wise this is also a mixed bag because all perform fine at some points and are off at others. Lead Justin Chatwin as Goku falls right into that category doing ok at times and not so much at others. Same can be said for Emmy Rossum as Bulma and Joon Park as Yamcha. Yun-Fat Chow however is good as Master Roshi and does not miss a beat, and Eriko Tamura is great in this as well [and easy to look at]. Randall Duk Kim is good as Goku's grandfather and James Marsters is great as Piccolo.

Now to be honest with you this film is kinda entertaining if you watch it with absolutely no expectations what so ever. For any one whom as know clue about the source material for this or any thing related to it I a pretty sure you would enjoy this. This is a popcorn flick for sure nothing but pure entertainment for those who no nothing about it. For those like myself who do know a thing or two about the source material it is kind of frustrating to see this film made like this. Still for those like me who do know turn off expectations and look at it like it is just another flick and it is halfway decent.

Especially Chow Yun-Fat - As Master Roshi, he hits his mark in most every scene.

3631908,3,B001HN69AE,"Fans of the anime (cartoon) series DRAGONBALL are legion. They collect everything from gaming cards to actual balls created to go with the show. Some go so far as to make costumes like their favorite characters. So, with Hollywood's reputation for taking source material and screwing it up to make it their own it's no surprise that fans weren't not enthused about the making of let alone the release of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION.

For those fans my guess is they didn't like the final product. The film opened to mild interest and even lower box office returns. And having watched only 2 or 3 episodes with my son when he was little, I can see why they weren't leaping over one another to purchase tickets. The story has changed and that is something die hard fans can rarely if ever accept. So what's the movie itself like? Not bad if you toss aside the history of Dragonball and look at it on its own. Not great, but not bad.

Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being raised by his grandfather. At home they study an ancient form of martial arts that is beyond most others. All the same, Goku's grandfather has demanded of him that he never display his abilities or get into a fight. The problem is grandpa isn't in high school and picked on by the jerks there.

Goku is though and when he comes face to face with them he does all in his power to avoid confrontation. Not easy when he acts clumsily in front of the hot popular girl Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who also happens to be dating one of the jocks. Fortunate enough for Goku, Jamie takes notice of him anyway.

During his training, Goku is told of the Dragonballs, the seven mystical orbs that when united will give the evil Piccolo the ability to take over the world. Entrusted to grandpa and then to Goku is one of the seven orbs. Unfortunately the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) has already collected several of the Dragonballs and on his way for this one.

Goku goes to a party hosted by Chi Chi only to be confronted by the bullies. While his anger rages, he does stay true to his promise of not fighting by avoiding any and all attempts to squash him by the bullies. Instead he allows them to use their own force against them. Not only does he beat them up without hitting them, he makes a good impression on Chi Chi as well. But just as things between the two start to gel, Goku realizes that something is happening at home and has to leave.

When he gets there, he finds the house in ruins, smashed to pieces and his grandfather lying beneath it all. He helps him out and talks to him, learning of the attack by Piccolo's followers who are trying to gather the Dragonballs. Goku has the one, now he must find those that remain and defend them from Lord Piccolo. And to do so he must enlist the help of Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) to complete his training.

Along the way Goku gets the help of several partners all seeking their own fame and fortune including another Dragonball owner and a fortune hunter. As they search they also find Chi Chi at a martial arts competition as well as numerous bad guys in the employ of Lord Piccolo.

As one could predict from the beginning of this film, the eventual combination of all seven Dragonballs will happen and Lord Piccolo will get involved in a final showdown with either Goku or Master Roshi. And while Roshi may seem a bumbling inebriated fool, never underestimate your opponent or his protg.

The film offers some decent martial arts sequences though when placed up against the natural or high wire scenes from far too many Chinese imports they seem rather slow and thought out. As a fan of the genre, that's the first thing you notice. If you've not seen many of these (or any Bruce Lee film) then the film comes off as a fast paced fight film. The average moviegoer will be impressed.

The story is based on one of the many chapters of the legendary anime series and moves along at breakneck speed. One minute we're training with grandfather the next we're on the road saving the world. The fact that it's based on this anime series makes that more believable. But the world of Dragonball is not one of reality but one of fantasy and in that realm this movie delivers.

As I said at the outset, fans of fictional characters and worlds are hard pressed to find the results delivered from Hollywood to suit their expectations. Even when they deliver the goods aren't always what those fans wanted. For every LORD OF THE RINGS there is a DUNE. Fans have so much invested in these worlds that what they get never meets their expectations.

If you go into this movie expecting that world you will be disappointed. If you go in looking for a decent action film that matches many tossed out by Hollywood, you'll walk away entertained. The low box office receipts say that there won't be a sequel. But that won't prevent those who take this movie on its own merits from having an enjoyable night at the movies.",1252195200,,4906,4.475391498881431
3631959,3,B001HN69AE,"This movie is Not like the anime.  The movie is very short so it takes a tongue and cheek perspective of DBZ.  Sure the the movie can be corny and special efects unrealistic, but that's the Idea.  Stephen Chow is a genius at making quirky toung and cheek martial arts action movies.  If you think this move was corny then you have not watched Shaolin Soccer, which was his break out movie to international stardom.

I like DBZ evolution.  it's funny, witty, and lots of action.  If you are watching the movie and saying ""Goku did not do this, Picolo did not do that, or that so not like the cartoon""  then you are too DBZ fanatic for this movie and will not even give it a chance.  I have seen actual DBZ movies such as Broly, Super Android 13, Tree of Might, Dead Zone, World's Strongest.  The older movies were good. But Broly and Android 13 are just plain awful movies, and the later movies are even worse.  DBZ evolution is more accessible to non anime watching people, and is entertaining.

3631960,2,B001HN69AE,"Hey, let's kick some more dirt on this one! So what does it say about a movie when, in talking about it, you open with the caveat: ""If you'd just lower your expectations...""? DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION happens to fall (plummet?) into this awkward category. Me, I know diddly squat about Dragonball or Dragonball Z, other than they feature dudes with funky spiky hair (but don't all animes?). So I walked into the theater with not much of a preconceived notion. Then I walked out, shaking my head and thinking that this film sucketh more than my working girl pal Back Alley Sally (down at the corner of Hollywood and Vine; she takes coupons).

I knew I was in for a horrible when, in the early moments, the camera cuts to a bead of sweat dripping in meaningful slow motion from some guy's nose. Then it's on to the petulant teen getting martial arts instruction from his adoptive Asian grandfather. Young Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is well-versed in assskickery but he's been self-controlled all his life and allows his school mates to rag and bully him. Things change on his 18th birthday, when his grandfather presents him with an odd orange orb called a dragon ball and tells him there are only six others like it.

Shockingly (but not really) the grandfather is murdered, and then it's on for the quest to save the world. Two thousand years ago the world was nearly destroyed by the otherworldy menaces Lord Piccolo and his disciple Ozaru. Now Lord Piccolo is back, all green and destructive and vaguely looking like that smoldering English vampire from BUFFY. The only way to stop him is for Goku to gather all the dragon balls, at which point a dragon emerges to grant one perfect wish. Along the way, Goku picks up folks to help him. Emmy Rossum is miscast and just sounds wrong as the beautiful inventor Bulma. Chow Yun-Fat, embarrassingly over-the-top, shows up in a Hawaiian shirt as Goku's mentor, Master Roshi, and Pat Morita really needs to climb out of his grave to slap the sifu out of him. Somewhere, I can feel John Woo carefully distancing himself. And there's some unmemorable young Asian guy playing a mercenary-minded bad boy. I'm frankly startled the world got saved.

I'll say this, the martial arts stuff is fairly cool (Chatwin's stunt double has got mad skills), and I even dug the near futuristic setting. And that pretty much sums up stuff that I liked. There's much here that's incoherent and painful and just dang silly. Philosophical conceits get bandied about, leading to irritatingly cryptic lines like ""To be at one with myself, I must be two."" DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION is what happens when Hollywood goes the cynical ""Let's just cash in, eff the fans"" route. As mentioned, I don't know much about the original manga and the anime version, but I have friends who went all howling apenuts about this movie. They were pretty cheesed. But, strictly as a movie goer, I say there are other things to slam, putting to the side the extreme dis to Dragon Ball's manga mythos and continuity.

The biggest detractor is the acting. It's as if all the actors involved knew going in that this was already a lost cause and so just didn't bring their best mojo. Justin Chatwin is... not good. I had qualms when I first learned that they'd cast a white dude for the part of Goku. It's like Scott Wolf in DOUBLE DRAGON all over again, in the sense that the guy is just totally wrong for the part. Justin Chatwin has the charisma of my third toenail. And his line delivery is so wooden that even William Shatner is saying, ""Oh, hell, no!"" (""My grandfather is dead. He.. was murdered. I... will... avenge him."").

I have no wish to dis on James Marsters, who was so awesome as Spike. But he's so bogged down here by shoddy dialogue and layers of green make-up that he never had a chance.

The only one who leaves a good impression is that Asian girl who plays Chi Chi, Goku's love interest. It's a good thing her hotness supersedes her character's crappalicious name. When I think of a name like ""Chi Chi,"" images of ugly little poodles and old Puerto Rican pro golfers come up, and I'm not turned on.

It's amusing in a way that one of the dragon balls just so happens to be in the hole that Goku and pals had fallen into. And then, sooner than you'd think, it's like the film writers, I guess feeling that even their slapdash approach requires too much effort, just gave up and called it a day because, out of the blue, Bulma informs the rest that Piccolo had just gotten a hold of the remaining four dragon balls. Ta-da! No more scurrying around looking for dragon balls! This quest sucks! If I want airbending techniques, I'd just scarf a bean burrito.",1252108800,2,4661,4.601684717208183

Unlike the other live-action films where you already have to be engrossed in the franchise to understand it, DB: Evolution takes you back to the beginning of the franchise and makes you get emotional invested with the characters. I'm hoping Justin Chatwin reprises his role in sequel(s) despite some other fanboys suggest. The extras are what you expect (gag reels, deleted scenes, interviews and behind-the-scenes). Unfortunely, no audio commmentary by the actors or creators of the Dragonball franchise was a disappointment. Perhaps in the sequel they will have a 2-disc special edition with the history of the franchise (please!!!).

3631963,5,B001HN69AE,"If this movie is compared to the anime (with all the changes in mind) it seems to take place between Dragonball and Dragonball Z, which makes it hard to compare.  If you saw the screen shots before it came out that showed a white colored piccolo you might have been put off, but the end result was impressive to me.  They managed to capture the silly childlike and optimistic mind of Goku, the attitude of Piccolo, the bubbly silly and nerdy aspects of Bulma, the explosiveness a young Chi-chi should have had, and the goofiness and perversion of Master Roshi.  Keep in mind that it captured all of these things in a weakened form because 3 foot high plastic wigs, day long arial floating near-light-speed combat, and more epsodes than you can shake scores of sticks at all don't fit into a Hollywood live action movie.  If you become sad that things were tonned down, then you might be looking for something along the lines of a Power Rangers movie with punkrock hairdos.  Sadly, I don't know of anything released in the US that was like that, except perhaps Fist of the North Star, which was also very good and very hated for being bizarre.  Dragonball Z seems to be the main inspiration for the characters in this film, and Dragonball Z was the ""WWF: World Wrestling Federation!"" of Japanese animation.  There has never been a serious attempt at a movie starring WWF characters that have super powers and giant hairdos, so there may be a reason for that fact.  In the meantime, I suggest people try to watch this movie with an open mind, expecting to see the characters they loved played by an excellent crew, the comedy they hopefully got from the anime, some bits of DBZ action, and a light-hearted optimistic attitude that has somehow made the jump from anime to U.S. made movie.  I feel this movie does Dragonball Z justice.

*Spoilers*

I am a huge ""Dragonball Z"" fan, although I'll admit to never getting terribly involved in the original ""Dragonball"", largely because I felt the material was directed at a younger audience. The best description I can give, therefore, of ""Dragonball Evolution"" is that it attempts to combine the plot arc of ""Dragonball"" with the maturity of ""Dragonball Z"", with mixed results. And, I suspect, this mixture is part of why the movie was so poorly received.

I'll start with the things I like about the movie. Although this is yet another variation on young-boy-learns-to-fight-and-gets-the-girl in a long series of westernized kung fu movies, I appreciate the fact that the young boy in question (Goku) starts out understanding that strength isn't about beating the bullies' faces in. I also appreciate that 'the girl' in question that he gets is a competent fighter in her own right, whilst eschewing the cliches of ""angry silent girl"" and/or ""bubblehead manic pixie dream girl"". Seriously, the Chi Chi depicted here seems like a normal, real human girl and that in of itself is a rarity in these movies. Bonus points for the fact that in humanizing Chi Chi, they avoided the ""violent shrew"" characterization that unfortunately pervades ""Dragonball Z"".

As far as other ""Dragonball"" references go, Goku is fairly well played - a sweet natured boy learning to master his own strength. Of course, I was extremely disappointed that we didn't get a 'super saiyan' transformation, but this is DB, not DBZ, after all. Bulma is extremely well done - maintaining all the cleverness, spunk, and bravery of the cartoon version with none of the shrewish whining that gets shoe-horned in from time to time. Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) is scandalously true to form, but with an uncharacteristic seriousness, and Yamcha is well-played even if his entire purpose seems to be for an incredibly badly-dialogued romance with Bulma, but whatever.

Unfortunately, I doubt this movie will please more than a handful. Hardcore Dragonball fans will probably be infuriated by the advanced age of the characters, the characterization changes, and the massive plot cuts performed in order to fit an entire TV series into a single movie. Dragonball Z fans will appreciate the aging and characterization, but will be turned off by the simplistic MacGuffin-fetching nature of the movie - something that Dragonball Z pretty much abandoned after the Namek/Frieza sagas. And, of course, movie-goers just looking for entertainment will point out that the plot is too cookie-cutter and well-worn to be of interest for long.

Honestly, I wish I knew what the movie producers were thinking when they approved this script. I realize that MacGuffin-fetching quests in which everyone learns something are easy to churn-and-burn onto film, and maybe they will gross a profit at the end, but it would have been smarter, in my opinion, to discard the manic (and overdone) ""collect dragonballs!"" plot and instead focus on, say, the evolution of Piccolo or Vegeta from 'bad guy' to 'good guy' and focus on the redemptive powers of acceptance and friendship and working towards a common goal. A movie like that could have all the action you could want, but with a fine undercurrent of philosophy and well-written characterization, and I suspect would be far more interesting to viewers. Bad/Good-Guys are perpetually interesting, after all, and it would be a much more unusual plotline than ""everyone want magic ball, go get magic ball"" that has been done and redone so many times. But, hey, that's just my own opinion.

Rent ""Dragonball Evolution"" if you're interested in a well-worn kung fu plotline that you've seen before a hundred times, but with slightly more fantastical characters and slightly better dialogue than some of the other clones out there. And if that sounds like criticism in the guise of faint praise, there could be something to that theory.

I have watched DBZ since it first started airing in '97. I realize it is older than that but I still was a big fan. So when Cartoon Network started airing Dragonball in I think '02 I was a bit curious of it and realized it is based on Goku and came before DBZ. I enjoyed it very much. The movie does alter a few things from the cartoon like how his grandpa dies. They also alter Goku's origin which I thought was stupid and Piccolo for some reason doesn't have his antennae. But if you enjoyed DB for the fighting and well the kamehameha or Roshi being a Porn freak....then you will most likely enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.

3632031,3,B001HN69AE,"OK the haters are really blowing things way out of proportion!  This movie is NOT a horrible piece of trash like they say.

It's actually pretty entertaining and fun to watch.

The biggest problem with the movie is that fans were expecting a perfect translation of DragonBall Z and this is NOT supposed to be Z, this movie takes place right before Z in the original DB series.
The Original DB was a adventure comedy like this movie is, fun fluff for kids with a fantasy feel.

By the end of the movie it sets everything up for the Z series to start (Z is all crazy action and huge epic fighting scenes) But unfortunately fans did not support this movie so I doubt a Z sequel will be made.

The other issues is that the movie is a bit low budget, and they did change things in the adaptation process, but no more than say the Spider-Man or X-Men movies.

For DB fans I say go ahead and watch it I give you permission, don't nit pick it, just set back and enjoy a re-imagined fresh look at your favorite series.

If you don't like it's ok, it's not like the existence of this movie will some how destroy your DBZ anime collection.

For non-fans if you liked movies like the Forbidden Kingdom or Dragon Wars this movie is for you.

If you lower your expectations this movie is really fun to watch!  I wish I saw it in the theaters now, even if it's a little short.",1249948800,,1361,4.22007722007722
3632032,1,B001HN69AE,"If you had taken the same actors and the same premise and changed the characters names to utterly separate this film from Dragonball, it would still be terrible.  The acting, production quality, and script are comparable to a few Straight-To-Video flims from the 1980s, and that's if I'm being generous.  If not for the run of the mill CG, one could swear that this film were made in the 80's.  If this film were a Sci-Fi channel original movie, and if none of the characters were named after Dragonball characters, it still wouldn't have been very good.

From the reviews on this site it looks like the people who give it a high rating are either very generous, hated Dragonball, were paid off, or are trolling people who post their honest opinions.

Here's a bit from a synopsis a good friend wrote. the rest is available here: [...]

""Original Muten Roshi: Old lecherous martial arts master who lives at Kame House with Turtle and spends most of his time chasing skirts or looking through magazines for them.

  Movie Master Roshi: Chow Yun Fat.  Really.  That's his costume.

  Demon King Piccolo: Planet Namek, a peaceful place, suffered a wide natural disaster so they sent Kami off into space so at least one Namek would survive. When Kami made the dragonballs he had to purge the evil from his heart and split in twain, which is how Piccolo was born.

  Lord Piccolo: From an evil alien race known as Nameks, he tried to destroy the world 2000 years ago but was trapped somehow.  Now he's back, and angry, and looks like the Dorian Tyrell version of The Mask crossed with the Green Goblin.  And also he's working with Mai for some reason.

  Mai: that chick with the anthro dog companion.  Worked for Emperor Pilaf.  Not very effective.

  Movie Mai: A bad ass gun toting martial arts ninja master mary sue who can also transform into other people if she steals their blood (wat?) and can leap off high buildings and vanish liek ninja.  No idea why she's working with Piccolo.

  Grandpa Gohan: Old martial artist who has a dragonball, stomped to death by Goku in his oozaru form.

  Movie Grandpa Gohan: Old martial artist who gave Goku the ball for his birthday, taught him how to use ki blasts, and is later crushed by his own house when Piccolo shows up and uses Force Crush on the house... really.. does the hand gesture and everything...  And the sad thing is this character is by far the most accurate, but only because he's dead in the original and dies in the movie.

  Son Goku: A Saiyan baby found by grandpa Gohan, got a head injury and was raised as a nice little boy.  Transforms into an oozaru when looking at the full moon until his tail is removed.

  Goku (or as the school bullies call him, Geek-o) : Sent to earth in a meteor by Piccolo, during a solar eclipse he transforms into a guy named Oozaru, who is Piccolo's servant.. and only about a foot taller than he is originally... Think of the Brutes from Halo 3. Also he doesn't have a tail.  And goes to high school.  And is kinda emo since nobody likes him.

  ChiChi: Daughter of the mighty Ox King, a decent fighter herself.

  Movie ChiChi: The hot love interest who at the beginning of the movie is hanging out with all those jerks who make Goku sad... bawww! But once he shows her that he can use his Ki to open her stuck locker, she is impressed and invites him to her party! Because like all teen drama love interests, she is having one, and until this point our hero was not invited =p  This Chichi is also a martial artist, but she fights in competitions. Boring.

  Bulma: Blue haired genius daughter of Dr. Briefs.  Built the Dragon Radar to find the balls and wish for the perfect boyfriend.

  Movie Bulma: Looks like a cross between UltraViolet and a reject from Matrix Online.  She has black hair... with two small blue hair falls that she probably got at hot topic.  She built a thing that's like a dragon radar, but looks nothing like it, and is called something else entirely.  She wants the balls to make herself famous by using them as a perpetual energy source (wat?)

  Yamcha: A desert bandit with a floating cat companion.  He's deathly afraid of girls at first.

  Movie Yamcha: A bandit who traps our heroes in a pit trap. Not afraid of girls.  Looks nothing like Yamcha. He looks like a j-rocker with spiky bleach blonde hair.

  And no, there was no Krillin, Puar, Oolong, Launch, Tienshinhan, Chaotsu, or anyone else from the original.  This is a good thing though as fans of those characters won't have to seethe over the utter rape of their favorite characters.""",1249776000,,4574,4.523926380368098

With the exception of the character names, ABSOLUTELY nothing was even close to being right. It may have been an ""OK movie"" (if you like sludge scraped out of a Hollywood gutter), but it was an awful movie based on Toriyama's work. When you make an adaptation, the fan base is what you HAVE to appeal to! There are plenty of other movies out there that have an inspirational element to them; this was just like watching a airliner nosedive into a mountain.",1249776000,3,469,4.269662921348314
3632034,1,B001HN69AE,"I'm sorry to say this, but Not even the awesome power of Blu-ray can help this picture, this movie is beyond terrible, you will not believe how bad this movie really is. I'm not reviewing the blu-ray features because, If a movie sucks so bad why the hell would you (or I) want to watch the special features?

First off, the Main Story is severely butchered to the point where everything unrecognizable to the original. The story is told very hasty and they don't bother to explain anything, and The've also rip off ideas from other great films... Dragon ball is known for great edge of your seat fighting Anime sequences, but in this movie There aren't any good fighting scenes AT ALL! None, Zero.

Second: There are absolutely NO character development in this movie at all, Bulma comes out of Nowhere holding a gun and says: they've stolen the dragonballs can you help? And Goku helps her, for no apparent reason. they team up and find master roshi, who likes to talk while he waves his hands, for no apparent reason!?.

Third: In the Anime and Manga, the main character Goku is supposed to be a happy, fun, cheerful, energetic character that only gets mad when bad people are doing bad things. In this movie goku is nothing but a stupid teenage kid who can't get a girlfriend, ride his bike to school and spends half of the movie feeling sorry for himself. (Lame!) And The DIALONG IN THIS FILM IS THE WORST I'VE EVER HEARD!

Fourth: For unknown reasons, one of the main character, Krillin does not appear in this movie (and I don't know why?). And for more unknown CRAPtacular reasons They used The Kamehame wave, (which is suppose to be a destructive beam technique) TO revive Goku as he lays on the ground because he's about to die, over a small idiotic gun shot wound. (I'm not even afraid to spill anything for you because your not gonna go see this)

Fifth: The ending battle between Goku and Picollo is SO retarded!, Goku throws a big Kamahame wave (which looks totally fake) and all you see is bright lights, They don't even show when piccolo gets hit!!! It's with out a doubt the Stupidest looking, CRAPtacular actions sequence I've ever seen in a action film!

Sixth: The only relation this movie has to the original dragon ball is the Dragonballs themselves THAT'S IT! this movie should have been called The Passion, because it was 90 minutes of pure torture. This is purely Hollywood's best at Film Raping.

Seventh: if you're a FAN of Dragonball, and even if you Not a fan of Dragonball, this movie is mediocre and disappointing from the beginning to end, It's Not entertaining, there's bad acting, the costumes in this movie looks like they found them laying around in back of a trashed Halloween store. I love the original Dragonball so, if you're a fan of the original you must stay away from this!..... This film easily makes my top ten list of the worst films I have ever seen... so,  OVERALL!

personaly i think this is a good movie, and it may not stick completly whith the origonal storyline, but i had a lot of fun with this movie. it is a fair movie!!!

3632036,5,B001HN69AE,"I gave this movie five stars because I loved almost everything about it.  Now this movie has got mixed reviews and the reason is because it was several things before being put on the silver screen.  When you take something like a comic, cartoon and/or a videogame you can't put all that is great about it into the movie.  Many times because it is impossible for whatever reason.  Putting that aside the movie was great, and the effects were awesome.
James Marster and Chow Yun-Fat are two of the best actors because they can do just about any role.  They played their characters perfectly as did Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum.  This was the perfect coming of age story, about a teenager finding out who he is and deciding his destiny.  Is he only what he was born to be or can he be something greater--better.
The only issue I have with this movie was the romance between Goku and Chi Chi, because for me it seemed forced.  Not because the two actors did not have chemistry they did, I just thought it was a little rushed.  Like it was only put in there because they felt he needed to have a love interest.

Seems the movie fell so short of their high expectations they all decided to team up via other websites to come here and give it negative 1 star reviews. How pathetic is that??,1249689600,,451,4.580246913580247
3632100,2,B001HN69AE,"THE MOVIE

Like many, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z served to not only entertain me as a child, but also introduce me to the world of anime and martial arts. Goku, Piccolo, Roshi, and the rest of the crew were on the TV in our living room at least two days a week, and my friends and I would engorge ourselves on any and all things DB -- from official toys to unofficial translated ROMs of GameBoy and NES games that had little to do with the actual shows we had watched.

So when Dragonball Evolution was announced as a live action movie, and when the casting began to be revealed, to say I was worried would be an understatement. I had seen so many other classic shows and series ruined by modern movie remakes... But DBZ!? ""Wait until it comes out,"" everyone would say. ""Maybe it will be decent!""

Well, in a way, they were right.

If you watch the film expecting a remake of DBZ, or even a retelling of that story, you're going to be horribly disappointed. For some of you, that's going to result in lengthy posts on IMDB about how this differs from the original cartoon. If you watch this and pretend it's a standalone thing not connected to the shows, though, it's actually pretty campy fun. Fantastic? By no means. Entertaining? Absolutely.

Yes, the story is full of plotholes and the acting makes SyFy movies look like big-budget Oscar nominees. But, like GI Joe and many, many other movies before it, Dragonball Evolution is not a movie to watch when you want something to think about; it's the movie you put on in the background while you do things, or watch with a large group of friends.

As a film, Dragonball Evolution is awful. The pacing is odd, it's riddled with cliches, and it's pretty obvious that the director didn't quite understand what some of the finished special effects shots were going to look like judging by some of the angles. But as entertaining, Dragonball Evolution isn't bad. Watch it with a big group of friends, make fun of it as you notice the godawful elements, and enjoy the moments of fast-paced action and cheesy special effects.

If you're a lover of classic cinema, ignore this movie. But if you're a lover of ""so bad they're awesome"" films like Plan 9, Manos, and The Room, then Dragonball Evolution is definitely one to check out.

THE DISC

- Audio and Video -

Like the movie itself, the visuals in Dragonball Evolution are a very mixed bag. On one hand, the AVC MPEG-4 encode (1080p, 2.40:1 OAR) looks great when it comes details like clothing, sand, pepples, broken glass, and other small, intricate items. Skin colors also look great -- starting out. About halfway through, it seems like the hue of skin will shift slightly from time to time. It's a subtle shift, but if look closely or jump a few chapters ahead after the first two, you'll probably notice it.

Blacks are also fairly bright, which gives the entire film a warmer, brighter looking appearance, even in its darkest moments. The green screen special effects shots also vary wildly, with some looking fantastic, and near demo quality -- and others looking like they're from a Shaw Bros. film.

Overall, however, the video in Dragonball Evolution is well above average, proving that at least part of the movie was well made.

The audio, however, steals the show. (Not hard to do when it's really only competing against the video...). Evolution sports a DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack, and it sounds great from beginning to end.

Bass is just booming enough to make you feel it, but not so much that action scenes drown out the speech. (Although, that may have been a good idea...) Music is strong, and the surround sound placement makes perfect sense for the action on-screen.

In terms of the A/V, Dragonball Evolution is a great release. It's just too bad that the movie they gave the technical team to work with happened to be this one...

- Extras -

As expected, the extras here are bare minimum, and not really creative at all. There are the required deleted scenes, blooper reel, and behind-the-scenes look at the making of Evolution. The lengthiest extra is a 25 minute interview with star Justin Chatwin (Goku), talking about his career, playing Goku, and everything you'd expect someone promoting a movie to talk about.

There's only one real Blu-ray exclusive, and that's an extra called ""Goku's Quest,"" which you need to unlock by pushing a button on your remote each time a dragonball shows up in the film. It's annoying to watch the movie holding a remote, and the pay-off isn't worth it at all. The Blu-ray also comes with a digital copy of the movie, in case you want to play a prank on your film school friend by loading this onto his Macbook while he's busy sipping tea at a coffee shop.

- Verdict -

As a remake of Dragon Ball Z, Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. As a ""film,"" Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. But as mindless entertainment, and a movie that any fan of MST3K would enjoy, it's perfect. Watch it with a big group of friends, have some drinks, and make fun of it. And if you do watch it, the Blu-ray version is the one to go with, as the video and audio are far superior to the DVD. Hell, it's so good that it almost makes the movie look better simply by association.

3632102,4,B001HN69AE,"Ok so I went into this thinking that the movie would suck. Many people online talked about how horrible it was and how it was nothing like the TV show or the manga. I can't speak on behalf of the manga, as have never seen them, but I have to say that this movie did a great job creating a feel like the TV show! The over exaggerated styles, expressions and humor were a lot like the TV show! Heck, even some of the camera shots looked like scenes from the show... I do understand that Son Goku is suppose to be a kid and Grandpa Gohan is suppose to be dead, but they changed the story for a change from something we've all seen! If they made movies and made them the same as the TV series there would be nothing new in the movies! It would be the same episodes we've seen over and over and over etc... on Cartoon Network! I am up for something new and different as long as it keeps the same feel!

Also, keep in mind, from what I can tell, the director seemed to want to recreate Goku as someone we could see in real life, minus the Ki. They show him as an average teenage boy that isn't so average, in a life that can be related to our own somewhat. Anyone seen Smallville? Smallville did the same thing with Superman. Brought him down to a level where he was a modern day teen! I think this worked very well in this case.

Am I saying there aren't any flaws? NO!!!! There are flaws, but for me specifically the rest of the movie made up for them! Everyone is entitled to their opinions, hence why there are reviews, but if you watch DBE with an open mind and are a fan of the TV series i think you should thoroughly enjoy the movie! I now own it on blu ray and the picture and sound are AWESOME!

So what are some things I didn't like?:

The Music: I liked some of the music, but the music really fell short on creating a Dragonball fell for me... I didn't want it to be like the TV show or anything I just wanted it to take me in the world of DB by hearing it... No go there!

Airbending: Ok so agree with most on this one... Why did they take away the Ki blasts? I've seen people do it with photoshop! Don't get me wrong the scenes look impressive, but why couldn't they have done the Ki blasts?

Chi-Chi: I really disliked this character. If you imagined Chi-Chi as a teen after watching DBZ episodes, this is the last way I would think she would act... Did anyone else think this character was just wrong? I know I know most of you hated the whole movie, but look at her and compare her to the others... Very bad...

Final battle: I love the final battle minus the length!!! I didn't expect to be as long as in the TV series since most of the battle are them talking about fighting... This would make for a very LOOOONNNNGGGG movie! I still think it should have been a longer fight... it seemed too easy for Goku.

Also, I have to say that if you are complaining about Goku not being Asian then stop crying about it! He doesn't look Asian in the TV series! Why should he look Asian in the movie?!

This is my summary:
Great movie! Does it stick to the original story: no... Do I care? NO! It was great! It had flaws but was overall a good movie! I heard they have a sequel written  already. I say: BRING IT ON!! I am ready for a bunch of LIVE ACTION DB movies!! Remember watch with an open mind and you will like it!!!",1249603200,2,3324,4.076569678407351
3632103,3,B001HN69AE,"Fate.
You control your fate.
Destiny.
You are the maker of your own destiny.
No one determines your future but you.
You must have faith and believe in who you are.
And finally, to be whole you must embrace both sides of your nature.

Simple principles, but key in this fantasy driven tale of courage and fate. I watched ""Dragonball Evolution"" with my sons (10 and 8) who love the cartoon. We were entertained and all enjoyed this easy to understand story of young love and destiny. There are fight scenes and lots of other action. Definitely family friendly and worth renting.",1249516800,,576,4.647058823529412
3632104,3,B001HN69AE,"This movie barely makes it into the martial arts category for me.  The martial arts is way over the top and not really focused on.  This is strange because the movie is all about a ""martial arts"" battle at the end.  In fact, the final fight scene was anticlimactic and disappointing.

The good news for this movie is that my kids loved it.  Both of them are girls and take martial arts themselves and they thought the movie was a lot of fun.  In the DVD extra features there is a training segment where they teach you how to do stuff from the movie and my girls got up and participated.  The whole feature was corny and over the top, but my girls ate it up.

Overall it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either.  It is kind of fun and Jamie Chung is fun to look at.  Kids from the 5-12 range will probably get a kick out of it.  The martial arts content was sub part, but the movie is based off of an anime that is based off of a manga.  I give it 3 exploding fists.",1249516800,,968,4.036842105263158
3632105,4,B001HN69AE,As I watched this film I went in knowing that there was no way it could meet the greatness of the original DBZ cartoons. In result the plot and character meetings were completely changed around to in a sense recreate the film. The action sequence were not mind blowing but still cool to watch the movie as a whole was good my only complaints about the film were yamcha being a horrible actor. other than that this is a great family film.,1249257600,,437,4.341463414634147
3632106,3,B001HN69AE,"Now that I've seen it I can play devils advocate. This movie attempted to take 30+ episodes of a show a condense it into an hour and a half. I say they did a decent job considering the budget and source material. That's why I gave it 3 stars. They also kept closer to the source material than people want to admit.

To ANYONE who has seen this and said this is the WORST movie they've seen they need to get out more(Desert Kickboxer, Vampire Assassin, Zombiez, Transmorphers, need I say more). Is it a good movie? NO. Sorry. But is it the worst ever. Not by far. First of all go see STreet Fighter: The LEgend of Chun-Li THAT was horrid. I actually wanted to watch the travesty that was the original Jean Claude Van Damme version.

I am a DB/DBz fan. Have been for years, and I NEVER thought this was a good idea. Ok maybe when I first started watching it I said ""Hey that'd be cool if they made a real movie,"" and then I realized how bad it would be. NO ONE would take the plot of ths show seriously and there in lies the problem. The source material, as awesome as it is, is very weak. Carboard chracters with no real development over 400 episodes and 3 shows. Seriously. Here's the basic formula to the series:
-Evil villain appears or threat of villain in found.
-Heores begin training to prepare for battle
-Battle ensues, someone dies.
-Battle continues, Hero gains new power level, defeats villain
-Deceased are wished back to life with Dragonballs.
REPEAT!!!!
That's it in a nutshell.

THE GOOD...okay, fine the ACCEPTIBLE:
-Gokou's perosnality. Gokou in the manga/anime is a very naive, good hearted, and brave character who loves to eat and fight. In the film he's been aged to his teens (Thank god cause the idea of watching a 12 year old as the protagonist for this is just scary), and yet his personality remains wholy unchanged. Yeah they use High School as a setting for him, but he's still good hearted, loves to eat, but instead of naive they made him slightly shy and out of place (which his son Gohan ends up feeling like later in the show). Justin Chatwin wasn't a great choice but he wasn't as bad as I thouhgt hed be. On another note though they should have spent more time training as his lack of any real fights was upsetting.
-Piccollo. At least he looked the part. Wish he was on screen more. And with Marster's already being not only a fan but already being familiar with action, he should have had some kick ass fights, but I guess they didn't want him upstaging the hero.
-Ki manipulation/energyballs/KameHameHa! Stuff looked good to me. The fight between Piccolo and Gokou at the end is the best, though still lacking. But it definitely invoked the spirit of the anime. The aura around Gokou as he powered up, the more intricate hand motions, and he definitely said it right. I actually got chills seeing that part. I wonder if the rest of the movie suffered because of it, cause it looks like that's where most of the budget went. Everyones crying about Gokou launching himself when he threw the KamHameHa, but Gohan did something similar in movie 9 against Bojack. Check it out.
-Oozaru. So what if he wasn't 30 feet tall and there wasn't a tail. The tail woulda looked bad and so would a 30 foot tall were-monkey. They got the look right for the creature, and granted it didn't look that real, but it woulda looked worse at the giant size.
-Roshi. Over the top is part of the character. If you don't like it then you hate the character. He was more perverted than the americanized cartoon version, and yet still had his moments of sagely advice. Yeah I know he wasn't bald, but hey Chow Yun Fat still did a great job bringing the character to life.

THE BAD, and THE WORSE
-Dialogue. Seriously? ""Believe it punk, you're getting your clock cleaned?"" Wow man.
-Fights. What fights? Chi-Chi Vs Chi-Chi was the only real fight. Every thing else was pretty much throwing a punch or a kick at the camera or the generic bad guys they fight ONCE! The end fight looked cool until they get to the hand to hand stuff and it just falls apart. They basically embrace, spinn and punch each other in the face. An extra month or so of training and that coulda been a real DB fight. And thats the thing, thats what the show is all about, and to take that out of it is taking away the best part of the show.
-Yamcha. UM WHat? Personality was right (minus the fear of girls), but other than that he was useless. I woulda loved to see him and Gokou go at it, and knock the crap outta him with the ""Wolf Fang Fist."" I understand they gave him blonde hair because in the anime his hair is kinda similar to Goou, but you have an asian playing him so I really don't think we'd get them mixed up. The character could have really brought more to the movie, again if there was more time spent training. Yamcha versus nameless minions, and Chi-Chi Vs Mai part 2, woulda have been a great juxtaposition with the Goku vs Piccolo fight.

NEEDED WORK
-The story. It was an adaptation. Toriyama himself said he saw this as an alternate reality of the universe he created. That being said I didn't have an issue so much with what they changed as how half assed they did things. Everything felt rushed. Gokou pining after a girl didn't bother me so much as the whole cliched, the girl can get him to focus scene. Also the fact that they threw things like Namekians in there but didn't try to actually explain that PICCOLO was Namekian was a little silly. They had all the beats but failed to hit them on time to get an impact. Also alot of the deleted scenes really should have stayed as they illustrate thins a little better. One such example, is when we see Gokou being bullied early in the film. We know he can take these guys apart, but he's made a promise not to fight. His frustration is shown as we see him put his hood up and walk away. What was cut is him trying to remove his bike from under the car, and we see him lift the car, WITH EASE, before the alarm sounds and he let's it go. That would have perfectly shown exactly how much he really is holding back.

Like I said I never thought this was a good idea, but people should be happy they got anything at all with what the source material was. If I see it for like $2 somewhere, I'll get it to add to my Guyver live action flicks, and the Street Fighter movie when I get it (The JCVD one), but it was not the train wreck Legend of Chun-Li was, and stayed closer to and resembles the source material better, and was actually enjoyable in some parts.",1249257600,,6511,4.354732510288065

They did change the story and gave it the movie treatment. Just think about it if they made the live action movie exactly like the cartoon it would have been extreemly cheesy. But i do feel overall there was the same spirit of the original, it had the same mix of goofball,action,and drama. Of course it could have been better and a little more true to the show (the biggest example being where in the heck is Krillian' thats hard to forgive).But still i liked it and i am a huge fan and i've seen every episode of all three of the cartoon series.

A barely coherent plot, shallow characters, a chemistry-less love story, and boring fight scenes all bring this movie down to a level that not even the most die-hard fan of anything this movie tries to offer could enjoy.

This film is not entertainment on any level.

I could go into more detail about how they changed: when characters met, the motivations of individual characters and how they changed the story line from the original series but it would lead to too many spoilers for anyone who has not seen the anime.  Overall it was just disappointing.",1248998400,5,591,4.6
3632173,1,B001HN69AE,"Well, to put it lightly, don't let the title (or rating) fool you, because this is not at all like the series it's based on. To be blunt, the only thing it has in common is the names. The spirit of the series, the morals it taught have been sacrificed in favor of a much more generalized and sexed-up Hollywood message.

The character personalities have all been altered to the point that they are barely, if at all, recognizable. In fact, if you didn't hear the characters names, even WITH familiarity of the series, you wouldn't know who half of them are supposed to be. Goku has gone from a carefree, pure-hearted, happy-go-lucky guy to a brooding teen that only cares about fitting in and getting lucky with the ladies, as well as sometimes wanting to hurt those who scorn him. Bulma has gone from the rich girl heiress with a genius IQ hunting Dragon Balls to wish for a boyfriend to a gun-toting Tomb Raider copycat who wants to harness the Dragon Balls' suspected energy to make money off of it. Chi-Chi has been changed into a shallow rich girl that completely ignores Goku until she sees he has special powers. Roshi's perverted personality has been toned down, and while that may be a sigh of relief for some parents, it's been toned down to such a ridiculous level that he seems more like a pubescent 13 year old than anything else, and he's been altered from the 200 year old master that witnessed Piccolo's destruction firsthand, as well as his master's sacrifice to seal him away to a middle-aged slacker that is a skeptic that Piccolo ever even existed. Yamcha has gone from a stealthy desert bandit and expert fighter to a fool with a small IQ who digs holes in the desert and waits for people to fall in so that he can pull them out... for a price, of course. Then there's Piccolo himself, who went from believing himself to be the King of Demons to being a Warlord on the planet Namek (that may not bother those not in the know so much, but it's a gross inaccuracy) and all menace that his character puts out was lost in this film.

Now other notable changes include: the need of a Dragon Temple to use the Dragon Balls, as well as a ritual dance to summon the Dragon, missing characters important to the story, such as Goku's best friend Krillin, who he grew up with (while training under Roshi, might I add), Korin, the master that gae Goku the strength to beat Piccolo, and Tien, Goku's former rival who joined him to get revenge for the death of his friend.

Now if that isn't enough to bother you, for a PG rating, the movie is anything but appropriate fare for children. Sexual imagery in some of Goku's fantasies about Chi-Chi, Bulma and Yamcha wink and make thinly veiled jokes when they believe Goku and Chi-Chi had sex, Goku and Chi-Chi are seen intensley making out more than once, and all ladies in this film, especially Piccolo's assassin, wear greatly clevage-bearing shirts/suits throughout the film.

All in all, this movie isn't really appropriate for kids on a theme level, it's too dull and disjointed for adults due to some HORRID acting and sloppy editing and directing, and it's CERTAINLY not aimed at fans, unless their goal was to offend them. My recommendation: save your money and wait for Season 1 of the original Dragon Ball to come out on DVD in September. Trust me, it's ten times as entertaning.",1248912000,19,3344,4.54983388704319
3632174,2,B001HN69AE,"""Dragon Ball"", a series that many fans in Japan and all over the world have looked at the manga (Japanese comic books), anime (Japanese animation) and its characters as passionately as those who have grown up with iconic superheroes as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and the X-Men.

Needless, to say that ""Dragonball"", may it be the original, ""Dragonball Z"" or even ""Dragonball GT"" are still series that no matter how many years have passed since the manga/anime/video games were released in Japan and even worldwide, continues to make money and its fandom continues to grow.

Whenever a passionate series is discussed about being brought over to a live action film, this is where directors, screenwriters and casting need to be fully aware of the rabid fandom out there.  Granted, no one is expecting a 100% complete translation from series to live-action film but most often at times, the producers and the director try to listen to fans as best as they can (ie. films like ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"").

Here we are with ""Dragonball Evolution"", produced by popular HK filmmaker and star Stephen Chow (""Shaolin Soccer"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"", ""CJ7', ""A Chinese Odyssey"", etc.) a film directed by James Wong (""Final Destination"", ""The Others"", ""The One"" and episodes of ""The X-Files"" and ""Millenium""), a screenplay by Ben Ramsey (""The Big Hit"" and ""Love and Bullet""), music by Brian Tyler (""Eagle Eye"", ""Fast & Furious"", ""Bangkok Dangerous"", etc.) and cinematography by Robert McLachlan (""Final Destination"", ""Bionic Woman"", ""Harper's Island"", etc.).

The film would star Justin Chatwin (""War of the Worlds"" and ""Traffic""), Chow Yun-Fat (""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), Emmy Rossum (""Mystic River"", ""Poseidon"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""), Jamie Chung (""Princess Protection Program"", ""Samurai Girl"" and ""Greek""), James Marsters (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" and ""Smallville""), Eriko Tamura (""Heroes"" and ""Reaper"") and Randall Duk Kim (""The Lost Empire"", ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""The Replacement Killers"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

This is the area where Twentieth Century Fox has been on top when it comes to Blu-ray releases.  Near perfect picture and audio quality.  How does ""Dragonball Evolution: Z Edition"" fare?

The film features a 1080p (2:40:1) High Definition transfer with AVC @ 33.5 MBPS.  There is a creative approach in the type of look that Robert McLachlan brought to film.  For one, the colors are quite vibrant and the film features a lot of detail.  But there are some scenes that are given a bright, dreamy look at times.  There are scenes that just look very impressive in high definition and the effects such as the Dragon Ball glowing, the detail on the rocks, clothing and also skin of the characters.

The transfer reveals above-average levels of detail in almost nearly every shot.  Eye popping colors, details on textures... the picture quality of ""Dragonball Evolution"" is actually fantastic.  There are some scenes where CG and stuntwork, seem a bit out of place.  For example, there is a scene where Goku has to hop during a lava sequence that just didn't seem right.  Also, Goku's transformation to the ape... it just seemed off.  And it would have been nice to see some added height, I know they can't go too big on the ape like in the manga/anime series but the visual effects for the ape seemed off for me.  But that's my personal opinion.

As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (Spanish, French and Portuguese are offered in 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The audio for this film is also very well done.  Dialog is crisp and clear. Although I found myself rewinding dialogue by Yamcha (Joon Park) and having to turn on English subtitles to figure out what he is saying at times.  Bass is heavy and deep and the action sequences, in which there are many, and audio just fills up the soundstage.  From blasts to countless destruction, your home theater system from all channels will be put to work.  In fact, I felt immersed with audio around me that it was so constant that my wife who is usually tolerable to my audio tests, felt that I was overdoing it.  I wasn't overdoing it, this is how the film's audio was.  There are scenes with constant sound effects that was balanced with a pretty good musical score by Brian Tyler.

So, needless to say, two highlights of this Blu-ray release is the audio and picture quality.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragonball Evolution: Z Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  *
  * Goku's Workout Featurette - (4:50) Two guys showing us how Goku fights and learning to punch, to kick and the proper stance.
  * Goku's Quest Game - Watch the film again and press the red button on your Blu-ray player remote when you see a dragon ball.  Try to find all seven.
  * Deleted Scenes - (11:08) A total of eight deleted scenes.  There are actually a few scenes that the director and editor should have kept in the film in my opinion.
  * Brian Anthony ""Worked Up"" Music Video - (3:21) An electronic music video for Brian Anthony's ""Worked Up"".  This was surprising because even for those of us following the film, the music that a lot of fans were looking forward to is the ""Rule"" by Japanese mega pop star (who has a tremendous following worldwide), Ayumi Hamasaki.  The song had a huge promotion in Japan (the music was used in the film when Goku was attending school) and people worldwide purchased the CD single because Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama had involvement with that release.  Personally, I wish there was an Ayumi Hamasaki music video included and probably would have brought her hardcore fans into buying this Blu-ray.
  * Fox Movie Channel presents Making a Scene - (9:27) The making of the good Chi Chi vs. evil Chi Chi scene.  The training that Jamie Chung had to go through for this scene and how challenging it was to make it work.  If anything, my mind started zeroing in on how many times the name ""Chi Chi"" would come up during this featurette.
  * Fox Movie Channel presents Life After Film School with Justin Chatwin - (24:57) Three film students interview Justin Chatwin in regards to becoming an actor, working on ""War of the Worlds"" and him observing Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, wanting to be challenged with this role and his interesting definition of ""manga"".  Also, interesting was Chatwin's response in regards to his friend going on a Dragon Ball website and telling him that everyone hated him.  Suffice to say, a very interesting featurette.
  * Gag Reel - (2:20) Behind-the-scenes fun with the talent and film crew.

The Blu-ray release includes two discs.  The second disc includes a digital copy of ""Dragonball Evolution"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I am a passionate fan of the series and the video games.  When I was younger, I would buy Japanese ""Shonen Jump"" and use it as a way to study Japanese and would save up to buy the import SNES video game when it came out and rent Japanese VHS from the Japanese rental store (which was quite far) to pick up the latest episodes of the ""Dragon Ball Z"" in Japan.  Needless to say, I'm a fan but at the same time, I know that I had to leave my passion out the door and look at this film as something fresh and new.  To see how much of the original series or its characters were incorporated into the film.

Having seen the Chinese version of ""Dragon Ball Z"" which was horrible, I figured that this film couldn't get any horrible as that film and most importantly, I was more curious how a big budget can lend itself to the feel of the ""Dragon Ball"" universe and its characters.  How much from the original they can incorporate to this film.  Because simply, films like ""Transformers"", ""X-Men"", ""Batman"", ""Spider-Man"", series based on a comic or animated-series that have been made to a live-action film, there are always going to be changes.

I'll start off what I liked about the film.  I enjoyed Emmy Rossum's Bulma.  Spunky, talkative and cute.  Chow Yun-Fat is a big name that brings people out to the theater's and his Master Roshi managed to capture some of that perverseness of the old man.  James Marsters as Piccolo was also fine (although he is missing his antenna's) and Joon Park's Yamcha, a bit more surfer dude but in a way, resembled the FUNimation Entertainment English dub character quite a bit.  Were these the right people cast for the film?  If you wanted manga or anime faithfulness, fans will definitely cry fowl.  But there were parts from the manga and anime series in the film and it was enjoyable to see those parts.

Justin Chatwin as Goku was a bit difficult for me to accept.  Fans know Goku to be a small character in the manga, the fact that this film features Gohan as a teenager (which is more in line with Gohan ala DBZ and Goten ala DBGT), needless to say that fans have cried fowl.  Even Asians had online protest of why the character is not Asian.

But other problems that I had with the film such as acting, pacing, visual effects and its screenplay.  Justin Chatwin used samurai's as reference for Dragon Ball especially in the special features in regards to the clothing and preparing for the role.  And I was asking myself why?  There was also the over utilization of the term ""air bending"" in the film which I can understand for those who know ki and bending of air for energy in Asia but for those who watched a ""Dragon Ball"" film, ""air bending"" is not a term typically used.  People are used to hearing more of ""kamehameha"" or even ""Kaio-ken for Gohan. And instead of focusing on the ""Dragon Ball"" dynamics, we somehow we get ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" in the film.

And speaking of special moves, let's discuss the final battle.  Goku and Piccolo are like Rocky vs. Apollo, Annakin vs. Obi Wan, Superman vs. General Zod and Wolverine vs. Sabretooth.  There has to be a good build up.  A show of rivalry and a believable fighting scene between both characters.  ""Dragon Ball"" is known for its fighting sequences and I felt that ending battle was just too short and so unsatisfying that if the final battle was done well, it could have made a difference.  The Dragon Ball mystique of Goku is the hero who seems as if he's getting beaten and looks as if he is losing in battle until he finds the opponents weakness and takes advantage of that weakness, comes back and beats the hell out of opponent.  Needless to say, the ending battle to the film was poorly done, I was disappointed.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is a perfect example of a film that has awesome picture quality and audio quality and has received a wonderful Blu-ray transfer but the film is unable to match that quality.

In the end, if there is plans for a sequel, there has to be significant changes to win the fans over again.  It's one thing of wanting to incorporate teenage life, romance and fighting (""Karate Kid"" is a great example of a film that manages to capture that and also include a satisfying ending fight scene) but somehow this film never reached its full potential of being a good film that would satisfy the fans or the non-fans.

By no means is this a terrible movie, but even having to leave my appreciation and passion for ""Dragon Ball"" out the door and knowing that the film would be quite different, I just felt the film missed its ultimate potential.",1248912000,3,11409,4.734414597060314

The rest of the film's aspects, from its special effects to its fight choreography, to the sloppy direction from Final Destination helmer James Wong, to the fact that the film is just over before you know it, all end up sealing Dragonball: Evolution's grave.  Still, there is something about it that makes it worth seeing, although for die hard Dragonball fans, this can pretty much be considered blasphemy.",1248739200,3,1497,4.920634920634921

Evolution will be totally weird and confusing to non Dragonball-philes, since nothing in the movie will explain much of anything. In fact, for those who are familiar with Dragonball the movie tells the story from the beginning, using characters and the ending from the middle.

To make matters worse, the film is riddled with cliches. Goku, the main character, walks around mumbling ""I must not fight"" in the beginning of the film. So guess what happens? And what is Chow Yun Fat doing in this?

With some appalling acting from Justin Chatwin (Goku) and Jamie Chung (chi-chi) it was impossible to know if you had paid to get into the cinema or were watching a school play. Akira Toriyame's story was destroyed when it was decided that this film would be a poor blend of the beginning and end of the anime, they might as well have thrown the Mona Lisa in a fire place!
However some interesting stunts were performed and some extraordinary special effects were used, FOX should have put the money elsewhere as a promising film was given to butchers and torn to pieces.

The Story Is Very Disappointing, I Think A Kid Could Write Much Better Than This...The Characters Are Like Garbled-Up Garbage (nothing against the actors).

The characterization of Goku (and Bulma, and Yamcha, and...) could not be more perfect. The comedy was appropriate and I thought the effects were wonderful. I think the story was as well-preserved as could be and they fit in all the key details for people who were totally unfamiliar with the story.

The only thing corny about the movie was Uzaru, but... there is no way to make a rampant sasquatch into a respectable piece of cinema.

This movie was GOOD. Not the best movie ever, but honorable to the Dragon Ball franchise and good enough to make me look forward to a sequel, should one come along. I am definitely buying it on DVD.",1248048000,3,895,4.451219512195122
3632347,1,B001HN69AE,"First and foremost, I will try to make this review as unbiased as I can, but that is pretty hard considering the debacle that hopefully cost Fox as much money as possible and squelch any rumblings of a horrific sequel.

Ok, as the immortal Steve Martin said in ""The Jerk,"" ""Roll the ugliness.""

Acting - Cheesy one liners from a soap opera are what come to mind.  Think Twilight mixed with all those shows you see about fake high school life and the dialogue is that.

Plot - With the will to be unbiased (DB fans needs not apply, goku got bent over and...well you know) the plot has some significant holes.  Goku, known as ""Ozaru"" somehow came to earth with Piccolo 2,000 years ago.  Yet he is 18 in the movie.  Goku is supposedly the slave/helper/""buddy"" of Piccolo and after 2,000 years can resist him with the best of them.

Special Effects - Um, hello?  Forgive the Dane Cook moment, but I literally laughed out loud when I saw the climatic battle.  I could make better battles and effects in flash and I am horrible at flash!

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, much less have some poor sap shell out hard earned money for this crap.

I always try to find at least one good thing about every movie I have ever seen and believe it or not, I have one about this movie.  The good thing about this movie is that I saw a bootlegged copy and didn't have to waste any money on this horrible attempt at a dragon ball movie.  I seriously hope this is the last we hear of this particular abomination of an attempt at a live action Dragon Ball movie.

3632350,1,B001HN69AE,"I'm sorry to say this, but this movie is beyond terrible, you will not believe how bad this movie really is. I'm not even reviewing the DVD features because, If a movie sucks so bad why the hell would you (or I) want to watch the special features?

First off, the Main Story is severely butchered to the point where everything unrecognizable to the original. The story is told very hasty and they don't bother to explain anything, and The've also rip off ideas from other great films... Dragon ball is known for great edge of your seat fighting Anime sequences, but in this movie There aren't any good fighting scenes AT ALL! None, Zero.

Second: There are absolutely NO character development in this movie at all, Bulma comes out of Nowhere holding a gun and says: they've stolen the dragonballs can you help? And Goku helps her, for no apparent reason. they team up and find master roshi, who likes to talk while he waves his hands, for no apparent reason!?.

Third: In the Anime and Manga, the main character Goku is supposed to be a happy, fun, cheerful, energetic character that only gets mad when bad people are doing bad things. In this movie goku is nothing but a stupid teenage kid who can't get a girlfriend, ride his bike to school and spends half of the movie feeling sorry for himself. (Lame!) And The DIALONG IN THIS FILM IS THE WORST I'VE EVER HEARD!

Fourth: For unknown reasons, one of the main character, Krillin does not appear in this movie (and I don't know why?). And for more unknown CRAPtacular reasons They used The Kamehame wave, (which is suppose to be a destructive beam technique) TO revive Goku as he lays on the ground because he's about to die, over a small idiotic gun shot wound. (I'm not even afraid to spill anything for you because your not gonna go see this)

Fifth: The ending battle between Goku and Picollo is SO retarded!, Goku throws a big Kamahame wave (which looks totally fake) and all you see is bright lights, They don't even show when piccolo gets hit!!! It's with out a doubt the Stupidest looking, CRAPtacular actions sequence I've ever seen in a action film!

Sixth: The only relation this movie has to the original dragon ball is the Dragonballs themselves THAT'S IT! this movie should have been called The Passion, because it was 90 minutes of pure torture. This is purely Hollywood's best at Film Raping.

Seventh: if you're a FAN of Dragonball, and even if you Not a fan of Dragonball, this movie is mediocre and disappointing from the beginning to end, It's Not entertaining, there's bad acting, the costumes in this movie looks like they found them laying around in back of a trashed Halloween store. I love the original Dragonball so, if you're a fan of the original you must stay away from this!..... This film easily makes my top ten list of the worst films I have ever seen... so, OVERALL!

3632353,4,B001HN69AE,"The Dragon ball name is something that holds a special place in the hearts of many fans, some die hard and some casual. Those hearts were undoubtedly broken when the announcement of an American made live action adaptation of the anime series was to be made. Whether you enjoy this movie really depends on the context of which you watch it. If you watch it and are a fan of the anime and expect it to match what you would see as the greatness of the anime and comics, then you will be disappointed. If you are not a fan but are still expecting a high octane action packed fantasy film, then you're going to be disappointed again. One way I think you would enjoy this, which is the way I looked at it, is if you don't have high expectations to begin with. That may be an obvious perspective, but given the way Hollywood works, quality films based on a comic and anime legacy such as Dragon ball are just not going to happen.

The story focuses on Goku (Justin Chatwin), who seeks out, upon his adoptive grandfather Grandpa Gohan's (Randall Duk Kim) dying request, to find the great Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) and gather all seven Dragon Balls. These seven dragon balls, when brought together allow the one who recites the ancient prayer one ultimate wish. There is a danger that the alien Lord Picolo (James Marsters), who is also on a mission to re-unite the Dragon Balls will succeed in his mission and use his wish to destroy the world. Goku and friends, Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Master Roshi, Yamcha (Joon Park) and love interest Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) embark on the dangerous mission to find all 7 Dragon Balls before Picolo.

When you tackle a comic and anime show such as this, there's a tight rope to walk for the director as he has to decide what can be included and what should be dismissed to combine the right level of real life antics with the fantasy nature of the characters and surroundings. There's also a comedy element that the director had to contend with so getting the balance perfect would be a massive challenge. Luckily, the balance worked very well into what was ultimately a light hearted and enjoyable movie for the whole family. Some of the better fight scenes are very well choreographed and take place during the first 45 minutes of the film and actually one of my favourite scenes places Goku outside a house party, being confronted by a gang of thugs and takes them all out without having to touch one of them. It's a scene that is very well shot and choreographed brilliantly to the point where the CGI moments even seem plausible in a reality situation.

The special effects, for a $50 million budget were really well and managed to convey the epic feel of the plot. However, one thing I didn't find really worked were the environments and the blending of the physical sets with the CGI expansions don't come together very well and it's obvious where the real set ends and the computer set begins. This detracts a lot from the overall feel of the movie and it's obvious that the lack of detail in the real sets compared to the CGI horizons are how it becomes so revealing.  Justin Chatwin does a capable job of playing the main character of Goku and it's certainly a brave role to take on as it's undoubtedly a character loved by many and he would expectedly receive massive criticism from the loyal fan base regardless of how good he will have been. James Marsters as Picolo is a good villain but the character itself doesn't have enough air time to really judge the acting ability within the role. Chow Yun-Fat is a delightful addition to the movie and he certainly takes on a comic style that makes him a very delightful comic character and a worthy choice as fight trainer.

I found this a very enjoyable film and as I'm not even acquainted with the Dragon Ball legacy, I suppose that was why I was able to view this film with casual enjoyment. If you are a fan of the comics and anime there will undoubtedly be a plethora of things you can pick out of this film about why it shouldn't be associated with the original anime and comic. My advice would to be just enjoy it as a light hearted feature and not think too much into it as I guarantee you will enjoy it much more.",1247184000,4,4205,4.470052083333333

The movie was made the way it was because thats what works for an American MOVIE!  Great special effects, alot of money spent on production.  I think its awesome and I'm a DBZ fanatic, sure it could have been a little better in some ways and could have had more fight scenes, but the important thing is it had ENOUGH!  If your a fan and didn't like it I suggest you watch it again and start supporting it so they make a sequal, all the time it took to make a Dragonball movie and nobody is even giving it a fair chance.  I mean what more do you want, it can never be better than the show; we all knew this going in, they have made a movie though so everyone get behind it cause its good!",1247184000,3,813,4.05625

If you are willng to undertand that this is a 90 minute version of a multi-episode saga from the show, and the fact that they changed a lot of stuff to make the movie more appealing to non-Dragonball fans, then you'll understand it is a good movie.  I say good, not super amazing.  The special effects are better than I expected, the fight scenes weren't terrible.

A friend of mine commented that he has gone through so many re-imaginings of Superman that so long as the dude flies, wears a cape and comes from Krypton then he's probably Superman.  I went into the movie with a similar expectations.  If he comes from space, knows martial arts and can learn the kamemhameha, he's probably Goku.

In short, if you want it to be exactly like the show, watch the damn show.  If you are willing to give this a chance, then great.  If you don't like, you are always free to sell it back.",1247011200,22,958,4.367231638418079

3632407,3,B001HN69AE,"Evolution was a good standalone action movie. I am a James Marsters fan from Buffy/Angel and I got a couple of other movies he was in to round out the collection.

Quite a few parts of the plot stayed the same.
Although they should have made Goku's Oozaru form gigantic and actually destroy some buildings in the city or something before he reverted.

Also the girls should have been less aggressive.
I did expect a young asian or asian looking actor to play Goku but Chatwick did well in the role.
And of course the great Chow Yun-Fat did exceptionally well in his role.

I think the modernization of the film caused the plot holes.
they mixed Goku and Gohan's roles by letting Goku go to formal high school. Also where was the OX King? Having him in as Chi chi's father would have made it a bit better.

By itself it was a pretty good action movie.
However in my collection I'd put it with the martial arts films instead of the dragonball ones.",1246492800,4,946,4.388571428571429
3632408,5,B001HN69AE,"I've been a diehard DB, DBZ, and DBGT fan ever since I was six and I waited for this movie to come out ever since 2002. It was absolutely amazing! Justin Chatwin and James Marsters brought Goku and King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo to life on the big screen! All of the characters looked almost exactly like they did in the cartoon: Goku has spikey hair and wears the orange costume, Lord Piccolo is green, wears a robe, and has antenna-like lines on his head, Bulma has a blue sripe of hair on her head and has her capsule bike, Yamcha has the same hair that he had in the cartoon and has a flying truck as a vehicle, Grandpa Gohan has a power pole and grayish hair, Chi Chi looks the same as she did in the cartoon, Master Roshi wears a Haiwaian shirt, and Mai also looks the same as she did in the cartoon. The people who made the movie couldn't make the animal characters, such as Oolong the pig, Puar the shapeshifting cat, and all of the dinosaurs, due to issues that they probably had with time or problems with computer animation, but the movie is still amazing! They were able to put Lord Piccolo's henchmen in the movie, (they renamed them the Fu Lum henchmen) although they don't look the same and they aren't named the same way (Piano, Tambourine, Drum, and Cymbal aren't in the movie) but they look like they're mutated (some of them have three eyes, crab-like claws, etc.) and they can regenerate. Mai still has the airship from the cartoon, Master Roshi has the jar that he tried to put King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo in in the cartoon, and the Dragon Balls are in the movie too. The special effects are incredible! They were able to have Goku and Lord Piccolo fly around in the air just like in the cartoon and the energy blasts/energy beams are incredible too! It seems like the creators of the movie took them straight from the cartoon and put them on the movie screen, especially with the Kamehameha Wave! The comedic tone of the cartoon is maintained in the movie too, like when Goku fights Master Roshi when he says, ""I am Master Roshi the Invincible! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"" or when Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, and Master Roshi are looking for another Dragon Ball and Yamcha accidently sits on an erupting geyser, and in many other parts of the movie. Also, the special effects for when Goku transforms into the Oozaru giant Saiyan monkey are amazing, too! I loved this movie and I can't wait to get it on DVD when it comes out on July 28 of this year! The creators of it did an incredibly amazing job with it an and I hope they make two or three more sequels to it! Maybe they can put Frieza or Cell or Babidi and Majin Buu in the sequels, if they make them?!",1246406400,3,2661,4.3453815261044175
3632409,1,B001HN69AE,"Okay, this movie is suppose be a live action movie adaption of the popular manga dragonball by Akira Toriyama. Dragonball Evolution focuses on the King Piccolo arc when The Demon King Piccolo escapes his eternal prison and sets out to find the dragonballs in order to restore his youth and take over the world. Also King Piccolo sends his minion, Tambourine, to kill all of the famous martial artists on Earth to prevent anyone from sealing King Piccolo away again. After the latest Budokai Tenkaichi tournament was over, Tambourine kills Kirrilin, Goku's best friend. Goku sets out to defeat Tambourine to avenge Krillins death and soon finds himself having to save the world from King Piccolo. After training for a while, Goku soon confronts King Piccolo and defeats him, but only after King Piccolo spits out an egg with Piccolo Jr inside. Now thats the Manga (original) version of the Dragonball King Piccolo Arc. Dragonball Evolution takes that story and changes the whole thing from top to bottom.
Goku is a teenager who cant talk to girls with no tail (Goku was about 7-8 years old in the manga and would say anything he thought of without thinking about the consequences), Grandpa Gohan is still alive and training Goku (he died when Goku was still a kid), Bulma still works for Capsule Corporations (thank god somethings right), Kirrilin is nowhere in the movie version (he's a main character in the manga), and Yamcha is also still a desert thief. You maybe thinking that you can deal with the fact that there are changes in the characters and it will still be awesome, but I'm here to tell you that this movie is poorly written, with poor visual effects, bad acting, 2 minute fight scenes, and Ki is now called air bending!? What is this avatar the last airbender!? The movie story is about King Piccolo getting out of his eternal prison and seeking out the dragonballs to restore his eternal youth to take over the world when the next solar eclipse happens. The solar eclipse is around the same time of Goku's 18th birthday, who receives the 4 star dragonball from Grandpa Gohan. King Piccolo comes to take it but finds only Gohan because Goku is at Chi Chi's party, who Goku likes. When Goku returns, he finds the house is a wreck and Gohan is dead. So, Goku sets out to find a martial artist named Roshi with Bulma (she just joins out of nowhere) and learns about how Piccolo tried to rule Earth 2,000 years ago when there was another solar eclipse(?), with disciple Ozaru. They soon also meet Yamcha who decides to help out-of-the-blue but find out there to late to stop King Piccolo because he now has all of the dragonballs. They Engage in a 2 minute combat, find out Goku is Ozaru when he turns into a ape when there's a eclipse (Goku turns into an ape when there's a full moon not when there's a solar eclipse! Also this transformation part of Goku's Sayain heritage), and Goku does the Kamehameha for first time. Goku and friends win and decide to get the dragonballs for some odd reason. And Goku and Chi Chi spar at the end for some reason(I don't know). All throughout this movie is bad lines, bad acting, bad effects, and bad interpretations of my favorite anime Dragonball.  All Fox did was slap Dragonball on the front cover just to make a few bucks.  If this was budgeted more then they could of gotten better actors, a better script, and had a new director.  This movie is one of the worst movies of all time.",1246320000,4,3437,4.603588907014682
3632410,1,B001HN69AE,"You could tell this movie was doomed from the start. First lets compare this to Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.  Now I am sure no one will mistake it for being great cinema as well, but at least Bay and Spielburg know the signifcance of the source material. If they did one thing right with the Transformers movies is at least they got the size, scale, movements, abilites,and personalities of the characters down. In DBZ you had characters that where  lightning fast, superman strong, and let out energy (ki) blasts that could turn the rocky mountains into  another grand canyon. The sad thing is lets face it, there are only so many Transformers, Batman, Spiderman, etc movies left. This would have been a golden opportunity for Fox to land that big next epic movie franchise. Epic is the key word because while you can point out some the same flaws in Transformer RotF as you can in Dragonball, like pacing, plot holes, not so great action, what seperates the two is when it got down the action  Transformers was epic, Dragonball was not.  Dragonball Evolution should have been the kind of movie that had teaser trailers dating back almost a year from release. It should have had a 200 million dollar budget, and for crying out loud, some kind of pre-release press, even if its just freakin G4. By the way does anyone know if the movie was advertised on Cartoon Network?  In retospect I hope the answer was no. Afterall it was Cartoon Network that brought Dragonball DBZ an DBGT to the North American masses, why would they want all their hard work flushed down the toilet.  It is sad that this franchise is now ruined, it could have been something special.

a waste of time. This was a series created in the 1980s with exceptional stoy telling and action scenes, This is 2009 in the USA

out of theaters and got the poor treatment by majority of fans and others, which it deserved. A VERY cliche and rushed storyline. Dragonball Evolution was child abuse, it felt like it was written by the director's five year with crayola crayons. Seriously the dialogu, even for a PG rated movie was PRETTY CHEESY.

3632415,5,B001HN69AE,"My review will be very short.

This is a dragonball movie NOT dragonball Z. except Goku and Yamcha; the characters are exactly like they were in dragonball. Now, all I've seen in db was about half the show. Chichi was a nice girl in dragonball; she did NOT become the loud mouth (from what I saw) `till dragonball Z. now, Yamcha was the same, they just intensified his personality.

They kept piccolo's story the same. Goku, they also kept. EXCEPT, they did make it out to be that he was from namek. But a sequel could very easily fix that.

Now, I'm going to leave this with a few questions I asked myself going into the theater: Why would they make a movie based solely on the show? Why would you pay money to see a movie you've seen 100 times over? And why would you deal with the crowds of a movie theater for a movie you already know?

And I was very surprised: they changed Goku's style and made it more modern day. But, that was all they changed.

Thank you for reading",1244937600,4,976,4.254054054054054
3632506,4,B001HN69AE,"Justin Chatwin's bad preformance. His acting was really, really bad in many places, literally where he's saying a line just like this: ""I...will...avenge...him...""

However, if that can be ignored, this is a near perfect adaptation of Dragonball. Despite many complaints about the Low (when did 40 mil become low budget?) budget of the movie, I don't really get it as I don't see the special effects to be any better than the really big budget movies (golden compass comes to mind).

And when it comes to the change of characters, I think for some reason people are just not getting it. Those who haven't ever watched Dragonball/Z/GT...I would've wanted to see this movie regardless of that. But for the fans who seem to the biggest bashers...I don't really get it. They haven't been really changed, just combined.

For an example, Goku is much more like Gohan later in the series. He is a teenager, doesn't really fit in school, but a girl likes him, etc. All of that is taken from that part of the story. ChiChi is like Chichi but in more ways like Gohan's girlfriend Videl, being a high school student, and being rich, etc, but still being pretty much the strongest woman alive. Yamcha hasn't been changed at all, save different hair color and outfit. Bulma has been made a stronger character, even though in the series she can be a very strong character, just a lot less mature. That is the biggest change in the movie there is.

Master Roshi, save the white beard, is the same. He is still a pervert at times and then an actual master of martial arts and a trainer at others.
Grandpa Gohan is actually given a part. Isn't that a good thing? And yes, I have seen ""Kirate Kid,"" and I do see the simiarilities of his part there. I do not see anything wrong with taking inspiration from that movie. Wouldn't any trainer who trained a teenage boy all seem like Mr. Miyagi (spelling) from Karate Kid?

I've even heard some people complain of why Piccolo was the villian. Ha; this is King Piccolo, whom was originally a villian. And Mai was just an added bonus to make the movie more exciting. She's somewhat based on a woman who served a character who was like a smaller, not very strong villian. But that's not a big change, and she's put in leather instead of an army commando outfit. She gets the power to shapeshift. Whatever...

With all that said, the reason why they called it ""Dragonball: Evolution"" is because it is an evolution of the series, another form as was the change from Dragonball to Dragonball Z, and even then to GT. This is basically number four, and it's really good.

As for the movie itself, there are many things you wouldn't have really expected on screen. ""SPOILER!"" Oozaru is in the movie, also partially based on his GT form as well as his normal form. This is not a massive altering; it's combining elements from different parts.

DOing all of this makes the movie very suprising in many places. The acting otherwise is pretty good, like Chun Yo Fat as Master Roshi, and James Marsters as King Piccolo. Emmy Rossum is not the best, but still doesn't a decent job. The other lesser known actors and actresses also did an pretty good job.

There is also much dragonball searching, as well as several good battles, including the last one with Goku vs. Piccolo. All of them are good. There are some cool capsule corp vechicles, etc.

All in all, this is a very good adaptation. I would give it 10 stars if Justin Chatwin's acting wasn't so bad. He is terrible. If (or do) they make a sequel, he needs to be recast. I think starting there would make more fans happy.

So I push it down to 4 stars, though more like 4.5 because it is that well done (I for one am really happy they even made a movie based off the Dragonball Series)that it doesn't make the movie not worth seeing. I reccomend everyone buy this CD, and try to ignore Justin Chatwin's acting and enjoy how good the rest of the movie really is.",1244851200,2,3931,4.514767932489452

3632608,1,B001HN69AE,"I have been a fan of Dragonball for years. I have the anime from Dragonball to Dragonball GT. But after seeing this so called movie I felt apart of my childhood destoryed within a hour and 30 minutes. So where do I begin? Well first, the Story was a mess there was little to nothing about Dragonball in it, and the pace felt rushed. There was no time for any plot development, or character development. Basically You meet Goku, then Bulma, Roshi, Yamacha and then final battle. So you can't get to know the characters, and understand why they are on this quest to collect all 7 Dragonballs before Piccolo. Also, it felt Fox was using other material from other famous movies and cartoon shows. Films like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, ans some materical from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Plus the movie never explain som important factors, for example, how does Piccolo escape his imprisonment, how does he hook up with Mai, How can Mai shape shift, Why does Piccolo need the Dragonball and so on. Second problem with this movie is the actors. Poorly casted, and they poorly portray their characters. For example; Justin Chatwin makes Goku sound and act like Robbie (played by Chatwin) in War of the Worlds. He does want to take on this mission to save the world, complains all the time and tries to hit on girls. Please if you have see the manga or anime you know Goku isn't like that at all. He stand for good and justice and all the heroic stuff; many Main characters stand for. Thrid, the speical effects look like some thing for the late 80s or early 90s. I can tell you used guide wires and the Kai or engery waves looked fake. I mean come on Look at Iron Man when Tony shots the glass in his lab they looked more realist then what you see in this movie. To rap this review up after watching Dragonball Evolution you don't feel they put any effort in this movie, they don't want to please the fans, or get people who don't know what Dragonball is into the series, no Fox did it to make a qucik Buck.

3632610,1,B001HN69AE,"Since 2002, me and many other Dragonball fans around the world have feverishly anticipated the release of a live action adaptation of one of the most beloved anime franchises the world over.

The idea of a live action Dragonball movie brings so much potential to the table, and really changes the perspective of film making in bringing an anime to life, and bringing fantasy to life in a whole new way. This should have been something we have never seen before, it should have been aw-inspiring, captivating, and capturing the very essence of the Dragonball series that so many people have grown up with and come to expect.

Sadly, Dragonball Evolution is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever laid my eyes on. Not only is this movie a wretched failure from a ""fan"" point of view since I am a fan of the material, but also as someone who loves and watches movies, and pays attention to Hollywood.

Within the last two years, we have seen some truely great films including. The Dark Knight, Iron Man, No Country for Old Men, Transformers, There Will Be Blood, Slumdog Millionaire, and many many more that would take up too much of this review.

With Dragonball Evolution, it takes all of the high calbur oscar-worthy/winning acting, and high grade special effects and production values, and pretty much takes it out with one destructive ""air-bending"" Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha(a little inside joke on the movie).

The movie is so out of touch with its source material, this movie can hardly be called ""Dragonball"". Outside of name-sake(or Marque value) such as Dragonballs, Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, Shenlong, Ma-fu-ba(sealing technique for Piccolo), Piccolo, Grampa Gohan, Mai, Chi Chi, Master Roshi, Oozaru, and the Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha. This movie has next to nothing to do with the original story and characters.

Even if I was not a fan of the Dragoball series, and didn't know what it was, I still would have found this movie attrociously bad.

The movie has so many problems, it's hard to list them all, because some just don't make any sense, or they are so confusing, it's really hard to put any of the movie into a coherent perspective.

I'll start with the performances of the actors. Simply put, Abysmal. They deliver pointless dialogue, have pointless scenes, no chemistry outside of boy-like-girl love interest, and lets you know you're watching a bad movie and nothing else. The actors are either un-interesting, extremely campy, or the dialogue is so horrendous you just cringe at it.

You would think with an actor like Chow Yun Fat on board, this movie would have some deceny to it. But sadly no, his performance may be one of the worst of his career. Goku(Justin Chatwin) is beyond un-compelling. He's just anger inducing to see him portray Goku in such poor character. Lusting after girls affections, wanting popularity, picked on by bullies for no reasonable explanation. Gag me with a spoon.

The story makes little sense. 2,000 years ago, Piccolo with his disciple the ""Oozaru""(that's right, not even calling him a ""Saiyan"") tried to destroy/take over the world but was thwarted by monks and Piccolo was sealed away. Without any explanation, Piccolo is free from his prison, has Mai(his hench-woman) at his side(who by the way has no back story to explain how/why she's with him), he's in an air-ship. And we are given no explanation throughout the film on his full intentions, or anything else relating to his character. Also, he has the shortest amount of screentime of the movie, totaling 5 scenes.

Meanwhile Goku is turing 18, gets a dragonball from Gohan, and Goku is somehow involved this cliched prophecy with an eclipse that relates to Piccolo wanting to destroy/take over the world for no reason what so ever.

Later on with the final battle of the film is where the continuity of the film throws its hands in the air and walks away from the movie. Piccolo is somehow able to control the ""Oozaru"" side of Goku, and that Goku is the ""Oozaru"" from 2,000 years ago who served Piccolo. There's absolutely no explanation at all as to how Piccolo is manipulating Gokus transformation, or how he even knows that he's a Sayain. Or if Goku is the Oozaru, then what the hell is going on? And if Goku is 18, then how was he alive 2000 years ago serving Piccolo? It's a total mind meltdown.

The movie is just full of continuity problems that plague the film from the main plot, to the character sub-plots that amount to absolutely nothing and have no sort of resolution. The special effects are horridly done, there's so much wire work you could swear they worked in a circus. And it's just a completely un-interesting film.

The acting is laughable and completely unbelieveable in any sense, the fighting and special effects are poorly done and look unconvincing, and overall boring. The story and plots are poorly written, confusing, and even leave a fan of the series like myself, completely lost in the continuity issues that plague this film.

This is easily one of the worst films FOX Studios has ever produced based on a major worldwide franchise. Do not buy this movie, it is a waste of time, and a complete disgrace to the series many fans know and love. But this is also an insult to people wanting to see a good movie, you're going to have to look elsewhere because this movie has no entertainment value to speak of.

Overall, this movie is about as cliche as you can possibly get by ripping off of better movies like Spiderman and the Matrix, but also being totally un-original, and just making no sense what so ever with its story, characters, and relating to the Dragonball series.",1243123200,83,5600,4.7815734989648035

3632658,1,B001HN69AE,"As a fan of the original anime on which this movie is based, I was wary about a live-action film, and with good reason. The Dragon Ball series is riddled with talking animals, gods, aliens, and other fantastic elements that do not mesh well with a live action film. But it isn't any of these things that earned the film such a low rating.

For one thing, the story lacks development. No explanations are given for more or less anything. The whole movie seems rushed, as if they threw together a story as quickly as possible and decided against putting any real effort into it.

Worse, there is nearly no character development whatsoever. Goku, the main character, is given a typical story. An outcast in school with a crush on the school hottie, Chi-Chi. But beyond that, he lacks depth. When his grandfather dies, he doesn't seem all that upset about it. He doesn't swear to defeat Piccolo, his heart isn't filled with rage. He's just...sad. And then he's over it, as if the man who had raised him had never existed. Goku isn't the only one to feel flat as a character; they all suffer from it, to such a degree that you become bored.

And speaking of bored, the fight scenes weren't very interesting at all. The original anime was all about fighting. Sure there was saving the world, and having adventures, and the eponymous Dragonballs, but in the end it always boiled down to a fight. The fights in this movie were dull. And worse, they were short. Terribly short. There was a fight scene in the anime that lasted over 4 episodes. None lasted beyond 2 minutes in this movie.

The acting wasn't stellar, but to be honest the actors/actresses weren't given much to work with. Like I said before, the characters were all...simple. Boring. Even Piccolo, the almighty alien who wants to rule the planet, gets no development. What is his motivation? Who is he? Where does he come from? None of these questions are answered. I suppose they felt developing the characters was pointless, since this movie was made only to appeal to those who had seen the anime. The fact that you can hardly tell it's James Marsters under all that make-up doesn't help.

This movie isn't the worst movie you'll ever see. It's not terrible. But It isn't good either. The sad part is, there's a lot of potential here. This could have been a good movie, if they had actually put some effort into it. I mean, the final fight between Goku and Piccolo, the be-all end-all grudge match for the fate of the world...was boring. I found myself wishing it was over, even though it didn't last more than two minutes. I was more entertained watching him confront his school bullies near the beginning of the movie.

This was a sad representation of a fine anime, a half-baked attempt to cash in on the popularity of something great. If they'd done it right, it could have been great as well. But movies like this are why anime and comic books have such a hard time hitting the silver screen.",1241222400,7,2956,4.578449905482041

They did a good job with the actors, they can act and they were pretty close to the personalities they had on the show. I can't wait for the DVD/BlueRay release and can't wait even more for the next movie. Maby we'll see Vegeta and maby even Gohan, never know!",1241049600,2,406,4.217948717948718
3632660,2,B001HN69AE,"Fans of the original Dragon-Ball franchise who have been drawn to the series distinct humor will find disappointment in Dragonball: Evolution. Goku who has been friendly strong and kind in the show has now become a whinny invert school-boy that gets picked on in classes. Chichi has gone through a total personality change as well, from a bossy loud-mouth to an over-friendly popular rich airhead that falls heads over heels for Goku almost instantly. Goku punches Chichi in the movie by 'accident'. It was surprising how she was so calm and 'forgiving' about being knocked out. The fact is that in the anime Chichi had to run after Goku to grab his attention, not the other way around. Bulma has also gone through a personality change and had it not been for the two blue strands of hair and actually saying her name she would have been unrecognizable with the exception of the machines. Yamcha has completely lost his fear of women and instead is like a lousy fill-in sand dune wannabe cool guy. Piccolo, instead of being the unique bad-guy with split personalities has become just the ""bad-guy"". He has totally lost his antenna's and pointy ears as well being reduce to a incomplete villain that just sends out his chick to do all his dirty work. Where are the rest of the characters? Where's Launch, Krillin, Yamcha's floating cat buddy, Tien and Chichi's oversized strong-as-an-ox father and others? Heck, even the dinosaurs are missing except for the giant eggs-scene at the very beginning of the movie.

Another disappointment is the fight-scenes. They are pretty linear in concern of action-fullfilling. A lot more of doing cool, swirly hand-signals and gun pointing/zapping than fights. And what has happened to Gohan's extension pole? It's not even included.

Goku turning into a Oozaru was pretty lame too. Instead of being the size of King-Kong he's normal height with no tail. All he has to do is to ""believe in himself"" and he'd return back to normal, which is not how it goes! The most disappointing of them all was the fight with piccolo, the Kamehameha (not 'Kameha' like the movie says) is supposed to be a gigantic ball of energy shot towards the opponent. Instead it has been reduced down to a stream of wisps when Goku lunges at Piccolo. When Master Roshi 'dies' the summoned dragon is a dwarfed,speechless,golden' glow version of the impressive original. No black ominous skies. Just a chopped, quick cameo with some cracking-noises, wind and lighting in broad daylight.

Some scenes are just down-right corny they are laughable. Why is piccolo being taken care of by chicks? What happened to the little-girl hiding under the destroyed village? Why is it that both Bulma and Chichi want to make out with the guys just like that? Fans of the original, stay away from this rushed-out preview. The OVA movies are way better in the way that they can be viewed with or without the series.",1240704000,18,2905,4.841046277665996
3632661,5,B001HN69AE,"Well, you can rip it apart all you want, and whine because it isn't 100% accurate to the Manga or the Anime, but the movie has the spirit of the original. I'm a fan of DB and DBZ and after watching the horrific trailers I almost didn't go to see this movie. But James Marsters, I could not pass up, and I was pleasantly surprised!

I do admit the movie is not without flaws.  Instead of making this movie for older fans of the series as they should have done, the producers clearly copped out and aimed the movie for a much younger audience.... The results are sort of what you would expect, the movie runs long at a quick pace of a small child in the throes of a sugar high: Frequent but short action sequences and a lot of glossed over plot points.  Some plot points could really have benefited from a little more explanation, but even without, the movie is not difficult to follow or figure out and the action is decent. The story is modified or course, updated but still in the vein of the original, with plenty of nods and cheesey moments from the Anime version to at least mollify the older fans of the series including a lecherous Master Roshi.

I could have wished for longer fight scenes, and definitely more screen time for Piccolo(I suspect both these wishes were curtailed by budgeting), but for what it was, Dragonball evolution hit the spot. No adaptation can be perfect, and when you are condensing a huge volume of story and nuances into about an hour and a half, guess what, its not all going to make it. And any one with common sense should know better than to expect it too. I went in expecting crap, and was happily surprised and entertained instead. I'm not saying you should buy it, but if you were a fan of Dragonball before, at least give it a shot and go rent it. You never know, you just might be pleasantly surprised too.

If nothing else your kids should like it.",1240704000,6,1891,4.360795454545454
3632662,2,B001HN69AE,"There's surprisingly little evolving going on in ""Dragonball: Evolution."" If anything, it de-evolves, taking an archetypal hero's journey and stripping it down past the bare minimum. So many details are either quickly alluded to or altogether overlooked, which essentially leaves us with a fairly bland action adventure story that throws in a little self-discovery for good measure. Based on the ""Dragon Ball"" graphic novels written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, ""Dragonball: Evolution"" is an airy, innocuous fable with a minimalist plot that doesn't require the audience to use their brains. It's really just an excuse for impressive visual effects and intriguing costume designs, and even then it doesn't quite work because not enough time is spent on them.

First, a little back story: During a solar eclipse 2,000 years ago, the evil alien warlord Piccolo (James Marsters) and his henchman, Oozaru, came to Earth with the intent to destroy it. Fortunately, a group of monks were able to imprison Piccolo with the aid of a spell. No one knew what happened to Oozaru, but it seems he's useless without his master's influence. As time goes on, Earth goes back to normal.

During this introduction, we also learn about dragonballs, billiard-sized spheres that glow like fire. There are seven in total, and each have a specific number of stars floating over the surface. When all have been collected and brought to a hidden temple, they have the ability to bring forth a magical dragon that can grant one wish.

Now, the story proper: We meet a teenage martial arts student named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who's picked on at school and always fumbles his words when around attractive girls. He was raised his whole life by his grandfather, a martial arts instructor named Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). As we meet them, the two are engaged in hand-to-hand combat while balancing on a pair of elevated ropes, which must be some kind of pale reference to the gravity-defying stunts of films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers."" As they fight, they draw strength from their Ki (in other words, they conjure up balls of light out of thin air and hurl them at each other). After the fight, we get a real sense of the film's dialogue; for Goku, this means an awkward series of one liners, and for Gohan, this means hopelessly clich proverbs about having faith in yourself. Goku knows nothing about where he came from or why he never knew his parents, although Gohan insists that he'll get all the answers come his eighteenth birthday.

And lo and behold, his eighteenth birthday arrives. So does Piccolo, and while we never learn how he managed to escape, we do learn that he plans to track down all seven dragonballs and use them for his own sinister purposes during a solar eclipse. As he flies through the clouds aboard a strange metallic ship, he relies on a young and deadly servant girl named Mai (Eriko Tamura) to actually retrieve the dragonballs, which are apparently scattered all over the world.

When Goku inherits a dragonball from his grandfather, it becomes his mission to track down the remaining dragonballs and save the world from total destruction. Along the way, he meets: Muten Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), the martial arts master who instructed Gohan; the ridiculously named and technologically well-equipped Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum, who I remember much more affectionately as Christine from ""The Phantom of the Opera""); and Yamcha (Joon Park) a desert bandit whose sole motivating force is a share of the profits. They're eventually joined by Goku's high school crush, the sweet-natured Chi-Chi (Jamie Cheung), who competes in martial arts tournaments in her spare time.

Never once does this movie pause to offer an explanation for anything. For starters, where exactly does this story take place? The exotic temples and village names hint at somewhere in Asia--a nighttime shot of a neon-drenched city skyline suggests Hong Kong. But since there's absolutely no language barrier, not even for an alien that's thousands of years old, it's hard to know for sure. Revealing that Yamcha talks like a surfer dude will probably be of no help, and don't get me started on the fact that the movie was filmed on location in Mexico. Moving on (and I alluded to this earlier), how exactly did Piccolo escape? How did Mai come to be in his service? What exactly is this Capsule Corporation that Bulma works for?

The ending is a nightmare unto itself for two very specific reasons: (1) it relies on a plot twist that the story wasn't building up to; (2) it culminates with an act of charity so PG-rated that it's downright anticlimactic. And what of the PG rating? Could that be the reason why a story about the threat of annihilation seems so unthreatening? It's probably the reason why I wasn't able to take Piccolo seriously--his pale green skin, dome-like bald head, and muscular black suit make him look more like a goofy invader from Mars than a frightening warlord from beyond. I know it's the reason why Chow Yun-Fat's dialogue was laughably bad. If there's one thing this man shouldn't have to do, it's recite lines that mention the collectability of a swimsuit magazine. I could be mistaken, but I have a feeling that most audiences will not expect such dialogue from a film like ""Dragonball: Evolution.""",1240531200,12,5342,4.928888888888889
3632663,1,B001HN69AE,"Wow. This movie was really, really bad. Don't waste your money on it.

I'll start off by saying that after the brief battle with Grandpa Gohan, Goku whines about not being popular. Goku does not want to be taught to be able to fight. He just wants to be taught to be like everyone else and he specifically asks to be taught ""how to get the girl"". There is a lengthy bunch of school scenes filled with Goku being called Geeko by bullies and a silly daydream about Chi Chi eating strawberries before the ever-so-cliche interruption of the teacher getting Goku to say something that sounds stupid to embarrass him in front of the class.

Remember all the hype from James Marsters talking about how deep Piccolo's character will be? Well it turns out he's barely ever in the movie for more than a couple of random one-minute segments that are supposed to build up to the ending...Wong totally fails at this as he could have used this time to explain Piccolo's motivations. Instead he shows Piccolo taking a Dragon Ball in a lake and he and Mai killing about two people. He also takes the time to tell that he was trapped in a jar by the Mafuba for 2000 years. Roshi 'helped' with the story explaining that Piccolo invaded Earth with Oozaru 2000 years ago. Why? Is it because he's the evil half of a Namek? No. In this movie, that good half (Kami) does not exist. Piccolo is just an alien who randomly appeared on Earth and for no reason wants to destroy and then rule it. But who would there be to rule? Mai, I guess.

Speaking of which. Mai's character is not developed either aside from her walking into a poor village with a woman and a girl that has the same hair style as Mai. They all speak Japanese (including Mai) in this scene. Nothing else is hinted at in this scene for Mai's origins. But you don't really ever end up caring anyway.

Wong then takes the time to show more of how this iteration of Goku is the complete opposite of the one we all know of in the manga/anime. Goku shows off to Chi Chi by blasting open her locker when it gets stuck and suddenly Chi Chi becomes attracted to him? Why? Because he can use ki I guess.

Wong again shows another opposite of what Goku should be by having Goku sneak out of his house to show off to Chi Chi at her party. Let's not forget to mention that Goku is skipping out on his birthday celebration with his grandfather and a big delicious, meal that includes cake. Hmm...I seem to recall Goku marrying Chi Chi in the manga/anime because he thought marriage was a type of food. I guess Wong decided to throw out that part of Goku's character as well.

So now Goku makes Chi Chi even more attracted to him by getting into a fight with Fuller and his goons and subsequently making them miss him and hit each other Why did Goku never swing at them once before or even in this fight? Because he is not allowed to fight. No reason is given here either other than it was flagrantly ripped off the Superman movie. Goku reveals to Chi Chi he knows nothing about his past or parents but that his grandfather would tell him. So he's been waiting all his life to find out who he is and on the day he is supposed to find out, he runs off. Goku skips a delicious meal and the story of his origins to show off to Chi Chi. This guy must be desperate for a girlfriend...yeah 'this guy' because that's not Goku.

So after Piccolo conveniently takes out Gohan while Goku's at the part, Goku senses something wrong and runs home...at the pace of a normal human I might add. Here's another extremely stupid part. Goku buries his murdered grandfather in his backyard. I could understand this is if this was the same Goku as the one in the manga who grew up away from civilization and the laws set forth, but this Goku grows up around normal people, goes to school, knows how to read, write, do math, knows the laws, etc. So the fact that he buries Grandpa Gohan in his back yard of all places is just ridiculous.

Queue Bulma's random appearance and let me tell you, this scene in particular has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The annoying voice Rossum came up with for her character is annoying very distracting. Here comes another opposite. Goku suggests to Bulma that they go on a quest for the Dragon Balls citing to a reluctant Bulma that she may need backup whereas in the original story it was the other way around. So if Bulma suggested this would it make her seem like a weak female character? Who knows!? laugh Oh, and let's not forget Bulma and Goku coming up with the name for her Dragon Ball Energy Locating device or DBE (get it?!) I'm sure James Wong didn't think you would get the 'joke' if Bulma didn't literally spell it out for you and say '...catchy!'.

We are then put through more bad acting featuring the introduction of Chow Yun Fat as Roshi. Fat tries to be funny, but ends up acting as ridiculous and poorly as Arnold Schwarzenegger when he played Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin. The fighting which was a flagrant ripoff of The Matrix and Spider-Man in these scenes didn't help with originality, which this movie completely lacks.

What is very annoying is the fact that Piccolo has this advanced airship yet manages to quickly fall behind in his search for the Dragon Balls.

Anyway, the film then establishes through Roshi that ki is nothing more than airbending. So instead of making the ki light-like energy, Wong goes the way of Avatar - The Last Airbender. Why? Who knows? It doesn't look like Wong or Fox actually like any of Dragon Ball though.

The next poorly-done scenes we come across feature Piccolo and Mai using Piccolo's blood to create rock-like monsters, much like Ivan Ooze's goons from the Power Rangers movie. The group then meets up with Yamcha the bandit, who in this movie for some reason has no idea how to fight even though the character of Yamcha has been established as one of the Earth's strongest/fastest fighters in the anime. After some drilling, the group somehow ends up in the middle of a giant volcanic area. Here they meet up with Piccolo's rock-monsters and a Power Rangers fight scene occurs against the monsters who regenerate in poorly-done CGI. I mean this CGI is the kind of trash you'd see on a Sci-Fi channel movie.

The one thing that is quasi-DB inspired is when ""Goku"" beats up Mai (actually the only people Goku beats up besides Piccolo are women). Mai kicks him in the face and it just moves the skin on his cheek but does nothing to hurt him. Unfortunately, the fact that Goku is played by and represented as a whiny wimp like Chatwin fails to make it look believable. Goku never questions why Mai is at the volcano and doesn't even bother to mention her appearance to the rest of the group

Another thing that was pointless was Yamcha and Bulma's 'relationship'. They liked each other in the manga because their was a comical build up to it. In the movie, they had about a minute of screen-time together before they tried to make out with each other. Why? Because Bulma likes bad-boys. So it's basically a rushed version of the Han Solo/Princess Lea relationship, but poorly done.

This next part is just sickening because it basically involves James Wong taking a dump on the character of Goku. Goku is supposed to learn how to perform the kamehameha to light the torches. Roshi again stresses that the kamehameha is an air-bending technique, does the movements all wrong, then goes to bed. Goku for some reason cannot pull it off in the slightest, so he actually tries to CHEAT by using a lit candle to light the torch. Okay, when did Goku ever try to cheat during his training? He always wanted to get stronger. Anyway, Chi Chi catches him trying to cheat, and Goku complains in a whiny manner of why it's so hard to perform a kamehameha, so Chi Chi gives Goku a flirtatious incentive to light the torches. To this, Goku is suddenly able to light all the torches with ease except for the last one where Chi Chi teaches Goku to perform the move his own way. After that, Chi Chi just can't resist and she and Goku make out.

So then what happens is that poorly-done Chi Chi vs. Mai fight scene that we've all seen released awhile ago. The gun Goku is shot with doesn't just knock him unconscious, it nearly kills him. Queue a foggy ripoff scene of Peter Parker having a chat with Uncle Ben, except it's Goku and Grandpa Gohan. Oh, and Roshi uses the kamehameha (which translates in English to turtle DESTRUCTION wave) to heal Goku. Obviously, Wong did not do his research in this area.

The plot then rushes to the climax that involves Piccolo getting rattled by Yamcha's flying truck that is again a ripoff of the flying Delorean from Back to the Future. What follows is a very poorly-done scene and explanation of Piccolo and Goku's past. Marsters tried to hype up Piccolo, but he was barely in the movie at all. He had no motivation for why he was trying to destroy Earth. He wasn't the evil part of another Namek like he was in the manga/anime, he was just an alien who randomly tried to conquer Earth for NO reason whatsoever. Even more confusing is his story about Oozaru. He says to Goku that Goku is the Oozaru who he tried to conquer Earth with 2000 years prior before Piccolo was trapped by the Mafuba. He also tells Goku that Goku came to Earth on a meteor and hid amongst the humans until his 18th birthday. He then said and I quote ""You WORKED for me!"". So how did an 18 year-old work for someone 1,982 years before he was born? James Wong is an idiot!

The CGI for the Oozaru transformations was really poorly done. The camera kept cutting so they could skip on you seeing the transformation. The Oozaru ended up being about the size of a small bear and even kills Roshi in yet another poorly-done scene. Even though the Oozaru is choking the life out of Roshi, Roshi still manages to form coherent sentences with little trouble breathing, then suddenly dies. Oozaru then transforms back to human form in an even more poorly-done CGI scene than the initial transformation. This time it's literally four or five images, the last being the exact same camera cut of the first transformation but in reverse. Oh, and one more thing on this subject. Goku's gi gets stretched out like crazy and his belt is just gone when he's in Oozaru form, but when he transforms back into human form, his gi is magically folded up neatly and his belt is magically back in place.

And now the battle we've all been waiting for. Goku vs. Piccolo. They fight for about less than a minute before it cuts to the 'real' main even of two gunslingers, Bulma and Mai, the latter of whom is taken out by Yamcha when he shoots her (because Yamcha can't actually fight without weapons in this movie, remember?)

The fight cuts back to Goku doing a jumping kamehameha into Piccolo, knocking him out cold and saving the world in about 50 seconds. So added together, the Goku vs. Piccolo fight is about as long as the Goku vs. the high school bullies fight. Combine this with 'airbending' techniques that look like they have no power to them whatsoever. It just looks like gas spraying harmlessly through the air. After this 'intense' battle, Goku looks as clean as a whistle. No cuts, scratches, or dents to him or his outfit.

So...after wishing just Roshi back (so much for the 'perfect' wish Roshi and G. Gohan talked about - why is it perfect? Don't ask me.) instead of everyone Piccolo killed, Chow Yun Fat again attempts to be funny, but to no avail. And instead of more training, Goku decides to join Bulma and Yamcha on their quest for the Dragon Balls...but not before he goes back to Chi Chi to make out with her once again. They then have a dumb argument about why Goku knocked Chi Chi out and how she let him, so the movie ends off with some lame Matrix rip-off of Chi Chi drop-kicking Goku while Goku jumps and punches at her.

Chatwin made all this hype about Goku's hair 'evolving' through the movie the more he accepts himself. It does change, but at the end, Goku just gels it back to the style he had to start with, so so much for that.

Oh, and did I mention a native is feeding Piccolo soup and hiding him under her bed at the end? Yeah, an evil alien tries to destroy the Earth and you hide and rejuvenate him. That's brilliant!

All-in-all, the movie is bad. Very bad. It's not the kind of bad that's either so bad that you'll laugh at it or bad, but fun. It's bad and boring. tired

This movie gets a 1/10. The one point coming from the music of Brian Tyler who seems to be the only one who put any amount of effort into this movie. It's too bad that his music is drowned out by a bad story, whiny voices and bad name and special attack pronunciations the entire movie. That was all just as distracting as the eyeliner Chatwin had too much of the entire movie. I mean I know actors wear makeup when on-film, but geez. That was way too much eyeliner. It made him look weird.",1240185600,14,12894,4.430379746835443

3632705,3,B001HN69AE,"Normally, I don't change my opinion of a film. But in this case, I had to revise my opinion of DB, rather drastically.

  Overall, Dragonball: Evolution is a schizophrenic film. On some levels, it captures the essence of the original Dragonball; on other levels, it's completely wrong.

  One oddity early in the development of the movie was that the released trailers actually made it look WORSE than it was -- in rather blatant contradiction to the normal approach where you try to make things look better than they are. The trailer led one to believe a number of things that simply weren't true (i.e., things that had, in fact, NOT been changed from the original were made to appear completely different). Why this was, I don't know. It's POSSIBLE the intent was to achieve the effect of making the viewer pleasantly surprised and thus view the movie more positively after the fact, but it seems a very risky method, and one that clearly didn't work well given that Dragonball:Evolution didn't make buttloads of money.

Spoilers follow, so don't read farther if you don't want to know!

The essence of Dragonball was preserved in some ways. It takes place on a version of Dragonworld -- it may be called Earth (""Chikyuu""), but it's Dragonworld. We have Capsules, and bizarre technology, wierd mixes of cultures... it LOOKS like a Toriyama world, made real, in many ways. On the other hand, much of the early imagery and culture looked too much like our own.

As I rather expected, they fused Gohan and Goku in terms of personality. This actually works well in that it allows us to introduce Goku in an at least somewhat familiar setting.

(Worries about him being a loser being beaten up... no, he's not. He has been made fun of, but it's not because he CAN'T fight...)

Chatwin, I'm happy to say, does this version of Goku well. He gets the innocence and awkwardness of the Gohan aspects, and when the time comes to be more ""Goku"", he shows it perfectly. Okay, his hair isn't nine inches high, but it's spiky in a very Saiyajin way.

Rossum *IS* Bulma. Yes, they've given her some action sequences, but I think that improves her character in context.

Chow Yun Fat was, as I said earlier, the RIGHT choice for Mutenroshi/Kamesenin. They toned down his Ecchi nature, leaving just enough of the dirty old man to keep him the same somewhat, er, earthy character.

James Marsters was, in fact, the PERFECT Piccolo. He sounded like Piccolo, he moved like Piccolo, and yes, he was very much GREEN like Piccolo Daimao. This was quite a surprise, given my early impressions.

  The casting, thus, was some of the good material in this movie. The plotline IN OUTLINE is pretty much standard Dragonball. The overall script, however, just doesn't quite manage it. There are clever pieces... but they don't quite hang together. The spirit's there, but it's not allowed all the way OUT.

Oh, one of the lies told in the previews? The mystics who banded together did NOT create the Dragonballs. They invented the Maa Fubaaa, a technique an awful lot of DB fans forget about, to capture and imprison Piccolo. The Dragonballs are, in fact, what they were always supposed to be, and the Great Dragon Shen-Long DOES make an appearance.

The music's pretty good, too.

Again, that's some of the good points, but the other pieces didn't quite gel. It seemed almost as though there was an argument or conflict with both the script and acting/directing as to ""how far"" to go, how much of the original to keep, and how to do it. One of the characteristics of Dragonball/DBZ is the *SCALE* of conflict, and they just didn't quite get to the level you need to in the final battle.

So in short, it's worth viewing, but it doesn't, alas, manage to give the pure adaptation we could have hoped for.",1240012800,8,3775,4.6893939393939394
3632706,1,B001HN69AE,"It seems Hollywood studios still don't get it. Spending 100 million dollars doesn't exactly mean great entertainment value or commercial success especially when making a film based on pop culture icons. They need a better script, better actions and most of all, someone like Guillermo del Toro, who can direct a film with confidence. ""Dragonball Evolution"" has none of them.

Some people in Hollywood just don't understand Son Goku is not Peter Parker, but anyway they wanted our hero act that way. Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is a high school student whose bicycle is crushed by a bully's car. The fact is, Goku is a martial artist who can use the enormous power of ""Ki,"" but his grandfather (and master) Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) forbids him to use it. However, Goku cannot take it any more, so he confronts the school bullies without actually throwing a punch. The brief scene, which reminded me of the cafeteria scene in ""Spider-man,"" is arguably the best part of the film (with now familiar slow-motions shots). Sadly this is the only part I find interesting in the whole film.

The rest of the film is simply a mess with one incoherent story about seven Dragonballs that will grant one wish. Villainous Piccolo (James Marsters) attempts to get them all to destroy the world, as the lengthy narration says, but his motive is not clear and besides, being already a formidable enemy with a huge floating ship, Piccolo really doesn't need them, does he?

Goku's romance with Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) just drags. The subplot of Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and Yamcha (Joon Park) is weak and rushed. Special effects are at best passable. The tone of the film constantly shifts as if director James Wong is not really sure what he is doing. The film only continues to use clichs again and again, adding nothing new to the thin story.

Many ""Gragonball"" fans complain about the changes done to the original manga. The reaction is understandable, but considering the length of the original books and the number of the events they include, changes are inevitable. I know some characters (like Krillin) must go and some characters' traits should be toned down. (Master Roshi played by Chow Yun Fat looks less eccentric than in comic, for example.)

But the real point is, those characters in ""Dragonball Evolution"" have nothing that made the counterparts in the original comics or subsequent anime series so popular and endearing among the fans. If you haven't read the original books or seen the anime, you would not see why the ""Dragonball"" series is so popular all over the world after watching the live-action film. Filmmakers should know Yamcha is not just a bandit; Master Roshi is not just a strange old man; Bulma is not just a gorgeous girl. They all could be very cool, funny and attractive in their own way, with the irresistible charm that the filmed version sadly lacks.

Stephen Chow, who is known for his ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" is one of the producers of the film. Perhaps I am not the only one who thinks Chow's delightful over-the-top style of direction would have been perfect for the live-action ""Dragonball.""",1239926400,7,3103,4.823308270676692
3632707,5,B001HN69AE,"First let me say, this movie is extremely flawed. But I think that's due entirely due to the low budget of the film. Also, if you're a fan of the Dragonball series, you will know that this movie does not have a whole lot in common with it. However, if you accept the movie as a different take on the Dragonball series and accept it for what it is, the movie is highly entertaining. I really enjoyed all the characters. Most notably Justin Chatwin as Goku. Sure, he was a white guy. But I think he really fit the part. I also loved his relationship with Chi Chi and Master Roshi. The weakest character, sadly, was Piccolo who REALLY needed more screen time. He's sort of an after thought. The movie also could have benefited from more fight scenes. The movie in general was way too short but I think that's due to the budget.

After seeing the Legend of Chun Li, I was expecting this movie to be just as bad. But I was pleasantly surprised. I think Dragonball fanboys will despise the film but I don't really care. The movie gets 5 stars from me for being the best it could be given the budget it had.

It's REALLY shameful how Fox treated this movie. It got nearly NO advertising. The movie came out last week and I had no idea it was out. I saw ZERO ads for it. Fox should NOT be allowed to handle films like this if they're not going to take it seriously. Shame on you Fox.",1239926400,3,1375,4.204545454545454

it was bad at all. And you know what? I HOPE there will be a sequel.
Because I LOVE Vegeta! And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people weren't ragging on it before they even saw it! I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions. They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie! So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than it's being gived. LOL Obviously it doesn't follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate. Call me crazy or stupid all you want.

3632710,4,B001HN69AE,"I know there are legions of DB fans and i am also 100% that many of them didn't see this film. If they had, it wouldnt have debuted at the 8th place in the box office with four million during its opening weekend. Needless to say, this is not a bad movie. Its not great, but it could have been way better. The movie also felt very fast paced. I would have liked to see a two hour film, but that just isn't happening.

Justin Chatwin has a certain boyish charm about himself and i  think he did a good job as a teenage Goku. He even looked like Goku from certain angles. If you see season three of DBZ when Goku fights Frieza, there are certain shots where Goku has many similarities to Justin.

I would have liked to see much more of the DBZ universe storyline incoporated into the film, but being that we are in the US and its 2009, its hard for asian themes to be weaved into american cinema without appearing corny. Check this film out because its not that bad.",1239580800,5,963,4.166666666666667
3632711,4,B001HN69AE,"As a fan of the Dragon Ball series, I (like so many others) was expecting a poo fest with this adaptation after seeing images on the net and reading spoilers. After seeing the movie I must admit that it was exactly the reversed of what I thought. This movie is great as long as you understand it's design. This film was never intended to be a carbon copy of the Dragon Ball series AND IT IS NOT DRAGON BALL Z. The creators adjusted the story of the original Dragon Ball, which is an origin story, to fit a new audience. Many have complained that the movie is not what it was supposed to be. It was exactly what it was supposed to be. Yes, elements of the original story had to be either altered or changed. this is true with any peace of production whether film or written.

If you are a true fan of the Dragon Ball series, you will look past the necessary alterations and realize that the movie captures the important elements of the Dragon Ball universe. Goku is an alien who was sent to Earth to destroy it but did not after being raised by the kindly Gohan. Piccolo is an alien (yes, they do call him a Namek) seeking revenge for being sealed away for thousands of years. Goku turns into his Oozaru (giant ape) form. Goku and company must travel around the world gathering the seven magic Dragon Balls, learning new martial arts from Master Roshi, to save the world from being destroyed. Goku has the same funny attitude he had in the series. Master Roshi's perverted attitude was toned down for the younger audience, but that is a good thing. Goku learns the Kamahamaha from Roshi.

All the important elements are here. the movie was great for an American adaptation of a Japanese anime. Marsters did a fantastic job as Piccolo and really made sure that the heart of the series was captured in a new and exciting way with his input. This is a movie that should be seen over and over again by fans. Those new to the series should really enjoy it. This film is for anyone who is a fan of martial arts, sci-fi, adventure, and action movies. And yes, there are explosions. JOY!",1239494400,4,2078,4.394805194805195
3632712,3,B001HN69AE,"as far as following the plot of dragonball and dragonball z. it didn't come close. however it was a lot of fun to watch. on the side of the wrighters. there is no way that they could have fit everything that the anime had in the movie. and still have been able to make a profit. i mean think people would you have wanted a movie that it took over a $1,000,000,000 to make. that is about what it would have cost to make the hardcore fans happy. it would have also been close to six hours long. they had to start with just the elements of dragonball to make it and they still went over $1,000,000. it had some of the best effects I have seen in a long time. The fighting could have been better. but at least the acting was not stale. It is  a good movie and the next one (Fox has already started making it) will be about the same.",1239494400,4,828,4.0181818181818185
3632713,5,B001HN69AE,"I had seen trailers and was not impressed and only went to see it because James Marsters was Piccolo and he made Piccolo come to life.  The whole movie was fast paced, no bogging down of the story and all the actors were very good. The music was excellent and I am so excited to see the DVD will be out shortly.  I am going back to see it again on the big screen and to anyone that is reading all the bad comments from people that have not even gone to see the movie, don't be close minded, go see for yourself.  There have been several different versions of Dragonball and this is just another and I loved it.  The next movie is going to start filming in May I think and I am looking forward to more of the Dragonball story.",1239494400,8,725,4.048951048951049

1) No one who created this Dragoncrap read what Dragonball was about. Goku did not go to school, speaking of school when he left.... did he go back lol, last oozaru did not join with Piccolo to take the world over.
2) I kinda feel bad for avatar the last Airbender fans for the movie to exist... I have seen that movie and felt for the fans but just realized Dragonball came in and took your concept as well... Airbending is what Roshi called it
3) Never mind the actors.... never mind the terrible story.... never mind they thought they would have a sequel.... but someone looked at the movie and said ok I think this is good exists.
