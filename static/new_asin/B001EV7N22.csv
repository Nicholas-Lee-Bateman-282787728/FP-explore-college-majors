8618213,5,B001EV7N22,"I bought this product and it has been great to put my daughter in front of these DVD's instead of Baby Einstein, these are geared for all the different stages of baby's growth. I also have a newborn (2 months old) and the DVD for him is quite different from the toddler version. The other products on the market are homogenized, one fits all videos and obviously a 2 month old has different needs than a 2 year old so I highly recommend this product!",1223337600,,450,4.305882352941176
8618214,5,B001EV7N22,"I highly recommend these videos.
I started with the 0-3 month video just to see how my baby would like it and he was completely captivated.  I wanted a video that would keep my baby intrigued but yet one that wasn't too lengthy.  I found just that in these series of videos.  The shapes, colors and pace of the video interested my baby which has continued with each of the successive videos.
We have been completely satisfied with this product and encourage others to experience them as well.",1223164800,,492,4.568181818181818
