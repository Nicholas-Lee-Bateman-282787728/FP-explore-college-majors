3794873,5,B001U06NBE,"The best thing about this movie is the relationships between the characters.  They feel REAL, and connected.  They call each other on their bad decisions but are supportive and loving anyway.  The acting is excellent, the cast chemistry an excellent mix...bottom line: THIS is the new go-to girls' night flick.",1239753600,19,310,5.16
3794874,5,B001U06NBE,"Great little romantic comedy...

The characters are great--you really come to like each one and get pulled into their story line.  Priestly is the best though...played by such a wonderful actor, Jensen Ackles.

Great film!",1239753600,5,222,5.285714285714286
3794875,4,B001U06NBE,"Had the pleasure of seeing Ten Inch Hero at a screening in Vancouver BC. It's a nice little rom-com. Good job, especially by Sean Patrick Flanery as Noah and Elisabeth Harnois as Piper.",1239667200,2,185,4.636363636363637
3794876,5,B001U06NBE,"This movie has all the makings of a great romantic comedy:
Tension between the leads, a battle of the sexes, a few ""White Knight"" moments, and no one turning out to be quite who they say they are. Quirky, if predictable.
Quite re-watchable.",1239321600,14,240,4.604651162790698
3794877,5,B001U06NBE,"This is a great little movie, especially if you have a thing for Jensen Ackles or Sean Patrick Flannery. If you like kick back movies that have a general plot and a lot of comedy, this movie is for you.",1238976000,5,202,4.075
3794878,5,B001U06NBE,"This is one of my favorite movies! It's so funny and pure, and I love watching the characters form fond relationships and grow as individuals.",1521158400,,142,4.72

3794880,5,B001U06NBE,Loved it.,1519344000,,9,4.0
3794881,5,B001U06NBE,"Originally, I bought this for the novelty of seeing Ackles in a Hot Topic wardrobe, but it instantly became one of my favorite rom-coms. Is it cheesy? Absolutely. However, it's slightly more realistic than the average Hollywood rom-com, while still wrapping you a a fleecy blanket of positive feelings. The overall vibe rather reminds me of the movies I grew up watching in the '90s and early '00s (except, with a couple nude sex scenes added in). If you're looking for a rom-com that's slightly off the beaten path without trying too hard to be ""indy,"" this is a good bet.

Note about the nudity: You couldn't use screencaps from the film for a reproductive anatomy class or anything, but it's more explicit than what the U.S. would consider a PG-13 movie.",1518393600,,757,4.734848484848484

3794884,5,B001U06NBE,This is a great movie! Very underrated. I've watched this movie a dozen times and I never get sick of it.,1509840000,,105,4.0476190476190474

3794886,5,B001U06NBE,"The main gist of the story relates to how friends of different backgrounds and motivations can become the most important and supportive family members in one's life.

This is my go-to film for those times that I need to feel warm and fuzzy.  It's funny and sweet and each character carries their role well.  Whenever one of my friends is in the mood for a movie, this is the first one that I suggest...especially, if they are going through a bad time.  They have all raved about it afterward and wonder why they never heard of it.  I have often wondered the same thing.  I originally found it when it was playing on cable.  I would not suggest it for young children because there is a little bit of violence and sex in it; however, it is integral to the plot and weaves in well with the sweetness of the main characters.

Why don't you cook up a batch of popcorn and enjoy it with this movie!",1505779200,,892,4.299401197604791

3794889,5,B001U06NBE,"I'm rating the buyer rather than the movie. The movie was pretty dumb. Let's be honest, we all bought it to oggle Baby Jensen anyway, and there are some wonderful parts with him. Though now I long for him to really commit to this punk look because it's surprisingly flattering on him.
I'd say what was wrong with the movie, but I watched it a while ago and honestly can't remember what happened in it. It's very.... 90s and trying too hard. It's kinda fun to watch just the once, but I doubt I'll ever look at it again. Also, I think Danneel Harris is naked at one point... So.... That's something.",1504224000,2,598,4.348214285714286
3794890,5,B001U06NBE,"This movie is really cute and awesome. If you love Jensen Ackles, you'll love this movie. All the cast members were great. I enjoyed this funny film. This is the movie where Jensen fell in love with his wife, Danneel Harris. :)",1503532800,,227,4.428571428571429

3794892,5,B001U06NBE,I wanted to get this because of Jensen Ackles and then I realized his future wife is on it and I love this movie it's got charm and humor to it with also life lessons and it's great.,1502755200,,182,3.8157894736842106
3794893,4,B001U06NBE,"Such a fun and sweet movie about friendships and love, with more than a little bit of quirkiness! With such a talented cast, you can expect a quality movie. Only con I have is the 360 degree, out of character behavior at the end of the movie, which completely invalidates one of the most endearing characters entire life and philosophy, just so he can ""get the girl"". It would have been better for her to grow as a person and look past his daunting outward appearance to the amazing person he has always been inside. Nope, easier to write it off as him changing everything he is so she'll finally acknowledge him. So many situations of support, love, and acceptance going on and the most obvious one turns into a shallow cliche nightmare. Really killed an otherwise amazing ending. Despite that, it's still a wonderful film with lovable characters and I do highly recommend it.",1502668800,,877,4.664516129032258
3794894,5,B001U06NBE,This was a really well thought out and entertaining story. The characters were very honest and real. You could see yourself or someone you know in each of them. I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would!,1501804800,,207,4.333333333333333
3794895,5,B001U06NBE,Good movie,1500249600,,10,4.5
3794896,5,B001U06NBE,"Super cute, funny, and has a ton of heart. It's a good movie to sit and relax to. Balances its cast very well. While the main character, Piper, is the focal point, you get to know the rest and each of their stories end happily fluffy.

The only real complaint I have for the story is Priestly's little transformation at the end. It was drastic and felt unnecessary. I don't like the idea of someone changing who they are to get the girl/boy. That being said, Tish was already vibing on him anyway, so I let it slide. They're super cute.

Honestly, I watched because Jensen was in it and I was curious as to what kind of work he did before Supernatural. Wasn't disappointed.",1498521600,,673,4.376

3794930,3,B001U06NBE,"Cute story. I love Jensen Ackles' performance, including the sexy fauxhawk, facial-hair designs, and t-shirts. He played the role with just the right amount of sweetness, sassiness, and humor. I take some issue with his character getting blindsided with a punch, because he looks more than ready to take care of himself in a fight; punks aren't all wimpy. If anything, he was a bit too clean for a punk. ;) My other quibble is that he changes himself to get the girl. A nod to conservative dress would have been okay, but the transformation was a bit...bland.

Not sure how this place stays in business, but that's just practical me.",1477958400,4,633,4.702702702702703

3794947,5,B001U06NBE,"I LOVE this movie so much. It's so unconventional, yet filled with events that we can all relate too. Jensen Ackles shines as priestly, whose utter hilarity steals pretty much every scene he's in. Clea DuVall is wonderful as always, with her calm demeanor and expressive face. During the length of the movie you forget all the names of these actors and feel like you have been dragged right in to the tiny Santa Cruz sub shop. I have noticed a lot of bad reviews about this saying it's ""cliche"", and I would honestly like to know what movie they were watching. I've never seen a movie quite like it. Even my ever-picky boyfriend and his romance-hating best friend wandered into the living room to watch it with me after they heard me laughing so much. After , they grudgingly admitted it was pretty good for a romantic comedy. Perhaps this movie just appeals to a specific bunch of people, but if that is true than count me in as one of them!",1462492800,4,942,4.4508670520231215

He does a great job as Priestly, the multi-pierced, Mohawk wearing character with the nice guy inside. I soon found that I could relate to these people as anyone can . wear a facade and hide his true self. By the end each has learned the truth about love, each other and even  themselves. It felt good and it felt real. If that doesn't do it for you, just remember that Jensen is still adorable.",1416355200,2,476,4.471264367816092
3795053,5,B001U06NBE,"This movie about a small group of people who work in a sandwich shop.
It should be boring.
It absolutely is not..... though, I will admit there are no explosions.... I am rather partial to movies with explosions.

This is a romantic comedy (the humor is understated) that follows the Harnois character who is looking for the daughter that she had to give up for adoption when she was 15. She takes a job at a sandwich shop a short distance from the home of the couple who adopted and is conflicted about keeping her distance while she watches to see if her daughter is happy
.... and that is only part of the story.
Turns out that Every character is played by a veteran actor and is thoroughly engaging, it soon becomes an ensemble cast with about a half dozen sub plots going.... they all bring something to the story.

Fried Green Tomatoes or Mystic Pizza have a similar tone, though this one is more optimistic.
Definitely recommended.",1416096000,3,938,4.544378698224852

3795067,5,B001U06NBE,"THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!! I was worried (like a lot of people on here) that the scenes that I had already seen in gif form would be the extent of the greatness of this movie, but I was completely mistaken. I am a romantic comedy fan, but this was one of the best I have ever seen.  The acting was spectacular and the plot was wonderfully unpredictable.  It's one of those movies that makes me feel warm and fuzzy(22) inside. ;)

Not to mention the awesomeness that is Jensen Ackles.  I love him on Supernatural, and he is the only reason I found and watched this movie, but he and all the other actors exceeded my expectations by a mile.  His versatility is mind-blowing.  He will definitely continue to be one of my favorite actors.

Daneel Harris was awesome in this; even though most characters like hers are written to be shallow and conceited, her character showed a great amount of growth throughout the entire movie.  I knew immediately that Priestly and Tish would somehow get together, but nevertheless their constant back and forths were very amusing.

Also, it just makes my life that Daneel and Jensen are married.

All in all, I loved this movie a great deal and I would recommend it to anyone (of the appropriate age, of course).  Well worth the $3.99!",1406419200,2,1268,4.566371681415929
3795068,5,B001U06NBE,Loved it. Jensen as Priestly was a totally different role. Love him in anything.,1406160000,,80,4.785714285714286

3795070,1,B001U06NBE,"This is worst movie I have ever watched.  The acting is robotic.  The characters and story are cliche.  I rented this solely based on the positive review and am still shaking my head at how bad this movie is.  It's worse than those cheesy Hallmark channel movies, and even some of those are OK.  It's a crime that anyone pays money to watch such garbage.",1404604800,,354,4.384615384615385
3795071,1,B001U06NBE,"Be intellectually honest with yourself: You watched this movie because Jensen Ackles is in it. Just admit that and we can all move on like rational adults.

The characters are so horrifically developed it made me hate them all. Instead of them being an endearing rag-tag bunch of misfits a la Empire Records, I really honestly hoped they all ran into the ocean and got eaten by sharks.
There are too many of them and the establishment of them as a family unit was so contrived and unbelievable that the chemistry just came off awkward and weird.

Piper? So she stalks this family to California to find her daughter that she had when she was 15. Is that not CREEPY to anyone? A tid bit illegal? Would it not have made more sense to just email this guy or call him and say ""hey, I think I'm your child's birth mother?"" No...let's pack up our stuff and move to a town where your daughter possibly is and ride by it on a bike every day because THAT'S perfectly sane and rational behavior. Stalk them at a beach and sketch a picture of your maybe-daughter sketching the beach. Nope not creepy at all because you're a hot girl and hot girls are above basic stalking laws.

The father of the kid? You have known this babysitter chick for, what? A day? And you let her watch your child overnight? There are probably some perfectly qualified babysitters in your area that are not creepy women sketching pictures of your daughter. Oh wait...she's attractive...I guess that makes it OK. And when he finds out his daughter's new art tutor is a creepy stalker he blithely lets her back into their lives like she hadn't just been acting like a freaking mental patient. ""Just be honest from now on even though you lied about yourself and your past from minute one and I don't really know you outside the fact that my kid likes you and I really want in your pants."" Also, she kind of just forgets about finding her long-lost daughter (who's apparently still out there)...I guess with Sean Patrick Flannery and a cute pseudo-kid you don't even need your biological kid that was the entire point of this God-forsaken quest.

The blonde ""nerdy"" chick behind the counter. Oh boo friggity hoo you have an internet boyfriend and he turns out to be, gasp, HOT? OH NOES! And she's not ugly so her little diatribe about how Tish wouldn't ""understand"" her reason for ditching her online boyfriend was complete BS. And even if she was ugly, who cares? Obviously the dude doesn't. Go say hey and stop being an idiot. By the way? If I found out one of my girlfriends hadn't had an orgasm, I wouldn't wait outside a room and coach her on how to achieve one - that's just weird. I don't know one of my girlfriends who would be comfortable with that and they shouldn't be - that's private. You want to help your BFF get the big O? Direct her to YouTube...there are literally tutorials on EVERYTHING. I also wouldn't go on a road trip with a girlfriend so she could meet an online boyfriend just to have her flake at the last minute over some over-dramatized-only-in-her-head ""problem""; I'd be seriously pissed. Road trips are fun but let's not forget the purpose of said road trip - making sure you don't get abducted and raped by an online predator.

The hippie that runs the sandwich shop? He lies about his whole past and was apparently in Vietnam (which shouldn't be a shaming thing) but it's totally OK because he's the paternal figure and we all have to love him because he wants to be a peace-loving sandwich maker that's obsessed with the weird chick across the street (who is not mystical and fun - she's creepy).

Creepy lady across the street - you knew sandwich man's past and it never dawned on you to you to be like ""Hey we went to high school together..want to get some coffee sometime?"" No? Everyone in this movie just lacks basic social skills? Alright then.

And Tish. Oh Tish. Just. Wow. If there are women out there in the world actually like this chick, I want to apologize to the male gender because I'm all for women being empowered but she's just a friggin caricature of bad decisions. And her boyfriend Tad? Way to paint closeted gay men as steroidal rapist misogynists - I'm sure they love THAT comparison. Why can't Tad just be an a-hole? No need to delve into his psyche...he's an a-hole. Simple. Priestly jumps in to save her because he's actually in love with her even though he's been calling her a slut for 2 hours (*eyeroll*)...then hippie man to the rescue and we learn his ""dark"" past.

I had to pause the movie at this point because it was physically hurting me to see all the horrible sub-plots and cliched devices. Unpause.

And then Priestly, bless his little not-believable-punk heart, dresses in Banana Republic to win over the girl of his dreams (who, like I said, he had been calling a slut the whole movie). So he changes his appearance to appease her...because a real punk dude would definitely feel the need to change himself to conform to societal norms...that's completely their thing, right? Priestly...get that girl tested...just saying. A woman can do whatever she wants with her body and likewise for a man but come on now - use your head (the one on your neck...not in your pants).

More on Priestly - like I said, you watched this movie or intend to watch it because Jensen Ackles is in it. I get it - he's aesthetically pleasing. I watched the movie because I thought maybe his acting prowess extended from Supernatural into movies. Boy, was I wrong! Then again, he WAS in Devour (ugh) and My Bloody Valentine (uggggggh)...so I don't know where my hopefulness was coming from. Oh wait, yes I do - from people who reviewed this movie whom I'm not really convinced watched the same film I did.

Movies are NOT this guy's forte. Stick to TV shows where your better acquainted, buddy. Get the paycheck, cash it, provide for your family, moving on.

WRITER, DO YOU EVEN LIVE ON THIS PLANET?! You're a 14 year old girl, aren't you? Just admit it. Then it'd make sense why this movie is so altogether BAD.

Honestly, this movie might have been passable with this ensemble had the director shot the writer ahead of time and hired another one...so the director is equally culpable for this crime against modern cinema.

I think honestly everyone looked at this script and they were like ""We get to do a CW-esque movie with adult themes? We get paid, you say? Plot be damned, let's shoot this puppy!""

I'm sure the actors are all just grade-a top of the line people that I would absolutely just pee myself with delight to meet one day (there - insurance against you psychotic fan-girls that will no doubt threaten my life over this whole review).

It had a great storyline and an even better underlying message for all of us!,1400716800,2,373,4.6923076923076925
3795077,4,B001U06NBE,I had heard good things about this movie and I'm a big fan of Jensen Ackles so figured it was worth a try.  Overall this is a great story about friendship and love.  And how you don't necessarily all have to belong to really belong together.  You really fall for these characters and want to root for them to figure it all out.  I enjoyed it!  It was also wonderful to see Jensen Ackles playing a completely different character than on Supernatural.  He was awesome.,1400630400,2,466,4.423529411764706

My only problem with the movie were the sex scenes, which seemed jarring and out of place. They didn't fit with the 'feel' of the rest of the film. That aside, I thought I'd have trouble with one of the character's change at the end, but it made sense, and I was left with the feeling that the character for whom those changes were made would change as well.

The roles should have been given to actors just starting the business, not ones trying to keep the paychecks coming in.

This is the movie that they fell in love in so if you are a romantic that alone should do it for you.

It is rare for me to find a movie that I connect with like that, so I deem this one excellent.

As some of the other reviewers stated, there are a couple of scenes with nudity and adult content but it isn't anything over the top and I did not find it offensive (and I am pretty prudish).

The one girl (Tish) is a tramp so I did not feel that the owner's (Trucker) anger at the 'boyfriend' was as justified as the movie made it seem.  The one with the cyber relationship (Jen) was predictable as was the main character with the art student's Dad. Cheesy and not that good really (not terrible but certainly not what the other reviewers are saying).",1325721600,2,522,4.473684210526316
3795148,5,B001U06NBE,"So going into this movie, you hear ten inches your mind will most likely go somewhere kind of vulgar. However, a five dollar foot long will just make you salivate. Now that some of us have snickered like a bunch of teenagers, this movie has a little more than expected. With each couple you will learn that there are underlying themes of hidden pasts, superficial vs hidden qualities, tolerance, acceptance of yourself and others, and a few views on growing up (even for ""grownups""). The acting and writing aren't the best but the movie has enough heart in it that you will forgive some of the bad dialogue and poorly delivered lines. The ending is a little contrived but it is a romantic comedy and one can expect nothing less. The one thing in this movie that stands out as extraordinary is the soundtrack. It has some original and some well known songs to round out the mood music for the film that will have you googling the film for that fact alone. So all in all, the acting is pretty decent, the writing while weak at some points does have more good moments than bad, the characters are intriguing at times, and there is some eye candy for those wanting that R rating to have more than just language. This isn't the deepest movie out there but for a decent laugh and a good sound track, this isn't a bad way to spend 90 minutes of your life.",1321315200,,1348,4.417670682730924

The main characters in the movie did a great job with their acting, as opposed to some of these other movies where the acting sucks but they still get all the praise.
Maybe too many story lines for such a short period of time, they could have been developed a little better, but overall a movie I would not mind sitting on my couch and watching again with some pop corn and some girlfriends.",1317859200,4,697,3.9857142857142858
3795152,5,B001U06NBE,"Wow! I loved the 4 main cast members.

This movie had a great story. The story is mainly about 3 girls and 1 guy with relationship problems. 2 out of 3 girls are really HOT! The third one is all right, but she had to look like that because it fits the story line better. The one guy is in love with one of the hot girls, but she doesn't notice his love for her because she likes dating only jerks.

The guy looks like a regular punker and maybe that way she doesn't like him because of his look. Also, he is too nice as well and doesn't really express his feelings to her.

Then, the okay looking girl is in love with a guy that she never met, but has known for awhile online. She really afraid of the thought of him just seeing her because the guy is way too good looking for her.

The other hot girl is trying to find her little baby girl that she gave up years ago and is that is the main story line. She finds out her little girl might be living in Santa Cruz with her adopted father, so she sets out to find her there. While searching for her little girl, she finds love.

Jensen Ackles and his future wife, Danneel Harris, are great in this film, and the rest of the cast (John Doe, Alice Krige, Sean Patrick Flanery, and the rest) are splendid.  The acting overall is superb.

Although best known for his roles in Dark Angel and Supernatural, Ackles is spectacular in this film -- if you haven't seen him in this very-different role, you will be highly impressed.  In my opinion, he should be a major star in a big studio blockbuster film.  Hope that somebody puts him in one, and soon.

This was a classic romantic comedy with it's ups and downs, people finding true love, and taking a risk by letting themselves fall in love. The characters are a quirky combination that work really well together and challenge each other. They are each others biggest support at work, the small sub shop with crazy regulars and a fun atmosphere, and also are each others friends outside of work. Besides two kind of awkward  sex scenes, the language and overall movie are fairly tame. The things that occur are deinfitely more adult themed and while the version I have is unrated, I'm sure it's R-rated.

3795165,4,B001U06NBE,"Every once in a while I like to find an obscure movie title, with a few ""familiar"" but not super-mainstream faces, with the hopes that I'll be entertained. Seems the movies that are heavily promoted these days (not all but some) miss the mark entirely, yet little projects like this seem to be overlooked but are better made, have more character development, etc...Ten Inch Hero is an independent romantic comedy film from 2007. Yeah, romantic comedy with all that that entails. The film was directed by David Mackay and written by Betsy Morris. The Ten Inch Hero of the title refers to a large submarine sandwich; as the majority of the characters we're introduced to work in a little sandwich place based in Santa Cruz.

The story revolves mainly around a young art student Piper played by Elisabeth Harnois. She is pleasant, playful, and lovely. She's moved there with the intention of looking for her daughter (she'd given up for adoption 8 years ago) and based on the little details given to her by the woman adopting she believes she's found Julia (her daughter). Piper gets a job at local sandwich shop and meets the other employees; Jen (Clea DuVall), a shy but kind girl who has an email romance with a stranger known as Fuzzy22. If you watched ANY of the teen movies from the 90's you'll recognize her. Tish (Danneel Harris) is a sexually audacious, emotionally disconnected but beautiful young woman doing her best to avoid love. Priestly (Jensen Ackles-from Supernatural) is the free-spirited goth of the gang, donning his outspoken screen t's and a colorful mohawk, who uses humor and sarcasm to disguise his own feelings and emotions. The shop is owned by Trucker, a surfer child of the '60s who's in love with Zo, the mysterious woman and owner from the shop across the street. Tucker himself isn't all that he seems. Interestingly Jensen Ackles & Danneel Harris are now real life husband and wife, having met while filming this movie. Each character portrays a rather STRONG stereotypical/literal interpretation of themselves...the shy, geeky computer nerd with an online crush, the promiscuous beauty who really might have a warmer heart after all, the overly tattooed, over pierced, strangely dressed guy who has more to offer that just sarcasm and jabs, etc...

The movie itself, of course, surrounds the foundations of love, friendship, relationships, self worth, parenting, and self actuality. There are a few quarky, warm moments, as well as disturbing ones that make you understand, relate, and or connect with the characters in one way or another. If nothing else it is an entertaining watch in relation to all the other typical romantic comedies out there.",1289088000,8,2681,4.968819599109131
3795166,5,B001U06NBE,"I found ""Ten Inch Hero"" on a list of films shot in or around Santa Cruz, California, where I lived for 10 years. I had never heard of the film or the people in it.  I bought it expecting it to have been filmed entirely, or at least mostly, in Santa Cruz where it was set. (I thought that even if it was awful, I could turn off the audio and just look at the scenery.) I was wrong about that, but I am very glad I bought it. It is sweet & funny & sharp & smart & conveys the spirit of Santa Cruz better than any other movie I have seen, even if  most of it wasn't filmed there. ""Normal People Need Not Apply"" says Trucker's Help Wanted sign; but who knows - or cares - what's normal? And who really wants to be what the world thinks of as ""normal""? Every character in the movie is, as we all are, slightly flawed & hiding some part of what they are. Through the course of the movie, with the support of their friends, they discover a few truths about themselves. And, just maybe, we discover a few truths about ourselves.  This was a small budget, independent film that could not find a distributor even though it was well-received at several film festivals. Yes, there is some nudity, some graphic sex, and a little language that could be considered by some to be offensive. I realize that I am not easily offended, and I was certainly not offended by anything in this movie. I think I'll go watch it again.",1282953600,5,1407,4.18450184501845

I LOVE Jensen Ackles...I love Supernatural...and I love Sean Patrick Flanery...that's why I bought this movie...and it was awful...I have never seen a movie that was for adults that was so predictable and poorly acted (Clea Duvall was good though)...Movie about a sandwich shop? How about a movie where the end is so cheesy that it it totally unbelievable? I keep reading that people love the characters...First off, Tish is a skank and just an unlikable character who will sleep with anyone good looking and its not until Priestly changes his entire self that she gives him a chance...that is bull...the whole point of the story is liking people for who they are and its not til he puts himself in kahkis and button down shirts that she will even look at him twice...(its further disturbing that since the two are engaged in real life that he was ok with her doing raunchy, full naked sex scenes with another guy)...Then there was Piper looking for her child and just making a spot for herself in the lives of the family who she thinks adopted her kid only to find out that its not her daughter...Of course to make the happy ending the dad and kid make a ""vote"" and decide there is a void in the family that she can fill so ok, lets just accept this kid as her own and stop looking for her real child...Trucker and Zoe...just plain out creepy with the wedding at the end...and then with the chick with the internet guy...there was something a little spooky with him dressing as a homeless man to introduce himslef to her...weird...

I didn't like it...I give it two stars just for that fact that Jensen is in it...I didn't care about the characters...in fact, I hated most of em...The acting was not that great and the lines poorly written...seemed like a made for tv movie...So I will continue to watch Supernatural and forget that Jensen made this movie and rewatch Boondock Saints to get that weird image of Sean out of my head...

3795175,5,B001U06NBE,"There is romance in this movie, but the main story has more to do about the waste and heartache that comes from judging people based on their superficial traits like physical appearance, dress or first impressions instead of really giving others a chance and getting to know them.

The script is excellent since it manages to tell different stories and develop the different characters without losing focus.  All the actors did an excellent job and made you believe and care about them.  This is rare when there are several interesting characters; usually you will care about one and the others do not matter.  That is not the case on this movie.

I have to mention especially the excellent job done by Jensen Ackels and Clea Duvall. Jensen's character was both funny and vulnerable and Clea's acting was moving.  I was also impressed by Daneel's performance; it was excellent, but also very brave.

This is the type of movie that you want to buy because you know you will want to watch it over and over again as well as recommend it to others.  I am surprised it is no longer available and I had to purchase a used DVD. ?",1259452800,3,1122,4.575
3795176,3,B001U06NBE,The movie is very sweet. not the greatest movie in the world. jensen ackles was funny in it.,1255564800,3,92,4.166666666666667
3795177,5,B001U06NBE,"I came into this move cold. Knew nothing. Before I saw the packaging I thought it was about a tiny hero. Such a wonderful surprise. Fantastic ensemble of actors, with, as others have said, Jensen Ackles standing out as comedic gold. Sweet story that reinforced the good in people and wonder of love. Sure some things could be guessed in advance but this isn't about whether something will happen. It's about enjoying the journey. Beautifully shot as well so I was sorry I couldn't see it on a big screen. The sunshine made the gorgeous cast shine.",1253750400,3,547,4.649484536082475
3795178,4,B001U06NBE,"not the best movie in the world, but it is definitly cute. Honestly only watche dit for jensen, and he was awesome, as always.",1252281600,4,126,4.291666666666667
3795179,5,B001U06NBE,My wife and I both loved this movie. Theacting is top-notch and the story lines knit well together. This is an ensemble type piece that works well. Many don't.  What you get is an arc of storylines that explore a range of the different kinds or aspects of love.,1252108800,3,261,4.326530612244898
3795180,4,B001U06NBE,"Decent movie, but drags in the middle.  The ""road trip"" part of the movie was totally unnecessary.  The part played by Danneel Harris was badly written, and hence slightly over done, but not as bad as it should have been based on the writing.",1251676800,5,242,4.4772727272727275
3795181,5,B001U06NBE,"I had seen some very funny clips of this movie and had been wanting to see it. I, like some of the other reviewers, was very afraid that this would be just a low budget flop. That the funny clips I had seen was the main part of the show. Happily, that was not so. It turned out to be a very funny, touching movie. It was good enough that my husband stopped playing on the computer and watched it with me. This is definitely a movie that I will be watching over and over and I feel sure that some of it will be quoted in the near future on my Facebook.
One more thing. This is NOT something that most people would want to watch with kids around. There are a couple of explicit scenes.
Two thumbs up!!!!",1249689600,38,701,4.014285714285714
3795182,5,B001U06NBE,"I like! The characters really captured a Santa Cruz feeling. I really liked the music in the movie. Very entertaining. I wish they would have filmed more of it actually in Santa Cruz. I could pick out the fake street signs,different beaches that were not Santa Cruz,light house in the wrong place,the Board Walk does not have a gravel/dirt floor. I think all the actors gave GREAT performance.",1249689600,2,393,4.794117647058823
3795183,5,B001U06NBE,This was a GREAT movie. I bought it because I am a huge Jensen Ackles fan. i was not sure that this would be a good film because it went straight to DVD. Boy was I surprised! I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone. Good Romantic Comedy!,1247184000,3,243,3.88
3795184,4,B001U06NBE,"I watched this movie by accident, well tuned into it by accident (paid for it- lol) but I was very happy to have pressed the wrong button on my control. This movie was great. Its much better than many high budget hollywood films- the writing is great (pulls at the heart strings without being predictable) and the acting is quite good. Basically  its a nice tale of friendship, love, and character with some humorous and oh my god moments. I say if you want a date movie or a movie to watch with the girls this is it- give it a shot- you should not be dissapointed.

However, be warned that it includes some se-ual nudity- important to know if you have kiddies around.",1243036800,5,668,4.379032258064516

3795186,5,B001U06NBE,"I am a Jensen Ackles fan so I knew about this movie years ago. I was so impatient about it coming out and I was excited that it had finally made it through DVD. Now initally I thought, the movie might suck but I wanted to see Jensen in it so it wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong. The movie was amazing. I loved every moment of this movie and I would watch it over again if I could. As you learn about the character, you understand them and how they think which was always the watcher could relate to. I was quite suprised at the quality and the meaning to the whole movie, and I haven't bought the movie yet, but I will when I am able to. I have it on my iPod which is quite fun to watch when you need a laugh. The cast was excellent and the message sent was quite meaningful. I would recommend a lot of people to watch this movie if they need to be touched. Yay! for Ten Inch Hero!",1239926400,6,880,3.8944444444444444
3795187,5,B001U06NBE,"OK. This movie is amazing. I love it. I just saw it recently and I have told everyone I know that they have to buy it!! I originaly watched it because Jensen Ackles was in it, but as I watched it I fell in love with all of the characters. Totally worth buying, I preordered my copy moments after I watch the movie. Must see! If I could give it more stars I would without a doubt.",1239840000,13,379,3.935064935064935
