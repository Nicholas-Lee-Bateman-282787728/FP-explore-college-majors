7922040,1,B00004STU2,"home theatre video featuring Mannheim Steamroller...won't play on ordinary equipment.  The seller explained to me after my complaint, that it was recorded on German equipment and won't play on American equipment.  No wonder it was so cheap...everything else I ordered worked fine.  But this one is useless.  Don't buy it.",1324857600,2,321,5.36
7922041,5,B00004STU2,"Been a Mannheim Steamroller fan since the mid 80's. Always great quality, superior sound. Nice easy way to test your home theater.",1322956800,2,130,4.954545454545454
7922042,2,B00004STU2,"I was looking for something to calibrate my home theater, and it this sort of does it, but there are much better discs out there.  I expected more from Manheim Steamroller.",1298764800,,172,4.548387096774194
7922043,1,B00004STU2,"It plays more like a ""Coming Attractions"" trailer for American Gramaphone's video offerings. There's some interesting stuff here, like the ""Visualizer"", an on-screen real-time, six channel spectral analysis of the program audio, or the fact that this disk has both Dolby Digital _and_ DTS audio tracks. (It clued me that the default settings for my DVD player disabled DTS, and [eventually] allowed me to hear the difference between these competing formats.)
Now for the bad news.

Navigation is a mess, some features don't work as advertised, and other things that I'd expect are strangely missing from this presentation. Examples include:

- Some menu selections don't appear to do anything

- Unusually difficult to see what current selection is

- Cursoring past one of the icons launches a special effect sequence without pressing Enter/Select. This disaster is repeated on several screens.

- I stumbled across a Photo Gallery behind the one of the musical selections, but have been unable to return there, only the ""Visualizer"" display is available. The standard for the medium would be a selection made on the Features Screen and/or the ""Angle"" alternative video selection on most DVD players, but it doesn't work that way here.

- Audio level on DTS tracks appear about 4-6 dB lower than corresponding Dolby Digital level, making A-B comparisons difficult.

- Visualizer shows LFE channel information is centered at 20 Hz with nothing above about 40Hz, which seems unlikely

For a true demo product, I'd expect some other calibration/setup aids on the disk such as test tones, color bars and reference sheets, and items that may illustrate the capabilities of the DVD player itself (alternate Video/angle/aspect ratios, additional audio material or languages, subtitles) would be nice. It shouldn't involve an Easter Egg hunt to find the material that is present.

In summary, I feel like I paid for a product to demonstrate the capabilities of my system, but got a flawed ""test of concept"" that is little more than an advertisement for American Gramaphone's revamped catalog. There's also an ""ain't we something!"" attitude that became annoying as frustration set in over getting even the simple stuff to work right. It's the first AG product that I regret purchasing.

N.B. This review was written for ASIN: B00004STU2, since discontinued, though this appears to be a virtually identical product, eliminating references to a dual-sided disk (DVD-Audio and DVD-Video on the respective sides.)",1257984000,,2501,5.261306532663316
7922044,1,B00004STU2,"I should have been warned by the title Home Theathor Demo, for that what it was just Demo, a selection of various images, one just some jumping lines in time to the music.  It was a disappointment. It should have been free or a token fee like $2.99.  It was not worth the $17.99 I paid for it. I am going to return it for a refund.",1203120000,3,331,3.925373134328358
7922045,2,B00004STU2,"I thought I liked Mannheim until they sent me this garbage.  Does demo mean ""destroy"" after you hear the whole ""dvd"" in about 10 minutes?  I thought there would be some music on there but there is really only 2 songs and some ancient footage with mediocre acting-- The only cool things are the asteroid comet thing which is already on other mannheim dvd's.  RIPOFF!!!  They shouldve sent this out free with their other dvd's.",1105056000,5,425,4.626666666666667
