6607914,5,B00N1S7O48,"This collection is limited to Crosby's films from the 1930s and 1940s that are now controlled by Universal.  That is why you will get ""Holiday Inn"" but not ""White Christmas.""  You will also get only the first four ""Road"" pictures with Bob Hope.  It does include an excellent documentary on Crosby from the ""American Masters"" series.  This is still an excellent movie collection from possibly the premiere entertainer of the 20th century.",1481155200,2,437,5.027777777777778

6607918,5,B00N1S7O48,"I'm up to 1939 so far. Am enjoying watching movies from the 1930s with stars I remember from my youth who are long gone now. I didn't remember that Fred McMurray could sing, and I didn't even recognize Donald O'Connor as a young lad in the movie ""Sing You Sinners."" I'm now through ""Blue Skies"" and still enjoying these old films so much. Seeing such great stars like Barry Fitzgerald, Betty Hutton, Sonny Tufts and Fred Astair in the movies of the 40s brings back pleasant memories of a time long gone.",1438387200,6,503,4.478260869565218
6607919,4,B00N1S7O48,It so much fun to enjoy these movies even if some were made before my time.  These are real movies without the computer generated graphics.,1435363200,2,139,4.56

6607922,5,B00N1S7O48,I agree with Calvinnme review on this box set. I own all but two of these movies in other collections that its not worth me buying them all over again just to support the cause. This box set is really priced good from Amazon and if you a person who doesn't already own the collection its well worth the money to purchase. I seriously doubt that the mastering is any better in this box set than what's been released already; I can't think of a business reason why Paramount would re-effort it unless if it was perhaps released on Blu-ray. I was really hoping that this set would be released on Blu-ray with dts Master digital sound.,1422748800,,631,4.401709401709402
6607923,5,B00N1S7O48,"Call it nostalgia or whatever, these old movies are a thrill to watch - particularly seeing some youngsters that later became stars. Good example, in ""Rhythm on the Range"", there's a musical number where a trumpet player is - look closely - Louis (Louie) Prima. In that same number, one of the singers in the group is Roy Rogers. Both of these were young and were not included in the movie's credits.

Whatever criticisms others have, I find the collection most entertaining and:

I recommend it.",1422489600,7,496,4.755813953488372
6607924,3,B00N1S7O48,"Many of these films are already on DVD. Let me go through my collection and see what I have as far as Universal-owned Paramounts:

  Variety Girl (overpriced Universal Vault DVD-R just recently released
  American Masters - Bing Crosby  - available on DVD  just recently released.

So I can get everything I'm missing on Amazon for MUCH less than the sale price of this set. The only thing I can't get is a pressed version of Variety Girl, which is in this set.  Bottom line - putting out the cinematic works of major popular stars in drips and drabs over the years and then FINALLY putting everything you ever had into one giant set is very annoying. Universal - do you think Bing fans have just been sitting and waiting for you to put all of this stuff out in one big box or, like me, wouldn't you realize they were afraid that the sets might go out of print and get into the hands of scalpers where we would never see them at a reasonable prices again? As Exhibit A I give you 1980's ""Fatso"" which is not that great of a movie, originally retailed on DVD at ten bucks but is now being held for ransom by scalpers at 150 bucks.

The cinematic works of Bing Crosby on DVD = 5 stars
This bait and switch sales tactic  = 1 star
I average this together to get three stars.",1421625600,31,2421,4.488532110091743
6607925,5,B00N1S7O48,"I recently watched the documentary ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" on my local PBS station - It's in this box.
I had almost forgotten how good Bing Crosby was.

This is a nice collection of 24 Bing Crosby musicals, produced by Paramount Pictures between 1933 and 1949.
Paramount musicals were not ""All-Singing, All-Dancing Spectaculars"".
Unlike the competition:
-- Warner: Busby Berkley
-- RKO: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers
-- MGM: Broadway Melody series

Bing Crosby's musicals were more laid-back productions, a reflection of Crosby's personality.
They are basically comedies or melodramas interrupted by a few songs.
Very little in the way of dancing.
There are no big production numbers for movie fans to wallow in.
The closest any of these 24 Bing Crosby films came to a big production number was ""Puttin on the Ritz"" in 'Blue Skies', and it's a Fred Astaire solo.
More typical is the performance of ""Pocketful of Dreams"" in 'Sing You Sinners' -  with Bing, Fred MacMurray and twelve year-old Donald O'Connor.
Wonderful song.
Plus a little dance and a lot of fooling around (Bing chews gum while lip-synching to the pre-recorded music track).
 - see chapter 3 on the 'Sing You Sinners' DVD.

Warner, MGM and RKO musicals had a standard ensemble of players, but Crosby's Paramount films went through a changing line-up of musical comedy co-stars:
- George Burns and Gracie Allen in ""College Humor"" and ""We're Not Dressing""
- Ethel Merman in ""We're Not Dressing""
- W.C. Fields in ""Mississippi""
- Martha Raye in ""Rhythm on the Range"", ""Waikiki Wedding"" and ""Double or Nothing""
- Shirley Ross in ""Waikiki Wedding""
- Donald O'Connor (age 12) in ""Sing You Sinners""
- Gloria Jean (age 13) in ""If I had My Way""
- Fred Astaire in ""Holiday Inn"" and ""Blue Skies""
- Betty Hutton (playing twins) in ""Here Come the Waves""
- Mary Martin in ""Birth of the Blues"" and ""Rhythm on the River""
- Basil Rathbone (yes!) in ""Rhythm on the River""

[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

It wasn't until 1940 that Bing Crosby finally found his ideal co-star in Bob Hope: ""The Road to Singapore"", followed by many more.
I don't usually think of the Hope-Crosby 'Road' pictures as musicals, but there are a lot of great songs in them.
Together Hope and Crosby made six 'Road' pictures for Paramount (four are in this box), plus a seventh for MGM.
For the confusing history of these movies on DVD, see my review of:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Road-to-Comedy-Collection/dp/B008M4C1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to Comedy Collection</a>

-- The only movie in this box given the deluxe treatment is ""Holiday Inn"" (1941), which comes with a commentary track and a 45 minute documentary about Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby.
Hit songs: ""White Christmas"", ""Happy Holidays"" (for New Year's Eve) and ""Easter Parade"" - sung by Crosby, seven years before Astaire sang it in ""Easter Parade"").
Directed by Mark Sandrich, who was responsible for many of the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rogers films at RKO.
In ""Be Careful, It's My Heart"", Fred Astaire's first dance number with Marjorie Reynolds, her resemblance to Ginger Rogers is amazing.
It's available on a separate blu-ray that includes a colorized version of the film + the black and white original.
This new 13 DVD collection contains only the black and white original (which looks fine).
Colorized Blu-Ray:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-Inn-Blu-ray-with-DIGITAL-HD/dp/B00LUKX5SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday Inn (Blu-ray with DIGITAL HD)</a>

-- All these movies have have already been released on DVD, some in earlier budget boxes.
No films were newly transferred from the original negatives for this new box, but I have no real complaint about the picture quality.

-- All 24 movies have English subtitles.
The 90 minute documentary ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" does not have subtitles even though the fine print on the box claims it does.
The 45 minute documentary included with ""Holiday Inn"" does not have subtitles (the box does not claim that it does).
The single disc version of ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" DOES have English subtitles:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Masters-Bing-Crosby-Rediscovered/dp/B00NHG1D96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Masters: Bing Crosby - Rediscovered</a>

-- ""Mississippi"" ((1935) has a score by Rodgers and Hart
""Holiday Inn"" (1942) and ""Blue Skies"" (1946) have scores by Irving Berlin (two of his best)

-- Shirley Ross was one of my favorite singers .  Her brief film career featured wonderful duets opposite both Crosby and Hope:
""Blue Hawaii"" with Bing Crosby in ""Waikiki Wedding"" (1937)
""Thanks for the Memory"" with Bob Hope in ""Big Broadcast of 1938""
""Two Sleepy People"" with Bob Hope in ""Thanks for the Memory"" (1938)

-- Twelve year-old Donald O'Connor (still a boy soprano) plays Bing's kid brother in ""Sing You Sinners"" (1938)
[fourteen years before ""Singing in the Rain""]
Fred MacMurray (five years younger than Bing) plays his older brother.

--  Thirteen year-old Gloria Jean plays Bing's adopted daughter in ""If I had My Way"" (1940). The following year she played W.C. Field's niece in ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"".

-- The four ""Road"" pictures include  a 15 minute mini-documentary on the Road pictures, plus brief extras that concentrate on Bob Hope's work entertaining the troops in World War II.

-- Bing Crosby has only a small part in ""Variety Girl"" (1947) - a duet with Bob Hope.
The plot is about two starlets trying to get a screen test with Paramount Pictures - Star Trek's DeForest Kelley (age 27) is the romantic lead.
Thirty Paramount stars (and directors) play themselves in cameos.
Hope and Crosby's regular co-star Dorothy Lamour is in it, but in this film she sings a duet with with Alan Ladd.

-- ""Emperor Waltz"" (1948) has a score by Johann Strauss ed. Victor Young.
Written and directed by Billy Wilder (just after ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Lost Weekend"").
In later years he was embarrassed by it - Schmaltzy, but it's not bad.",1420243200,66,6260,5.31041456016178
