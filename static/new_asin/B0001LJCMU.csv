2012866,5,B0001LJCMU,"If you are a hard-core fan of Transformers or just enjoyed the first season of Beast Wars, then you'll love the second season.  The plot quickens and focuses in these seven episodes, reaching a cliff-hanging finale that ties the Beast Wars to the original Generation One Transformers.  The intricate way that the story develops and the nearly flawless animation (steps above the first season) drew me in when I first saw the origianl airings and convinced me that the Beast Wars incarnation was more than a creative spin-off using the 'Transformers' name.  I'm pretty picky about which of the many variations of Transformers storylines I choose to follow, and I think this is one of the best.
To be fair, there's not much in the way of 'special features', but that doesn't detract much from the value of this collection.",1080259200,2,820,4.8428571428571425
2012867,4,B0001LJCMU,"The best way to describe this season would be ""the ragin' climax"".  Everything changes here, some from season one go, some stay, and what's better....almost everyone gets a transmetal upgrade.  That's what I like most about this season, the interesting new forms that various maximals and predacons take on.  Personally I think the most powerful and sleekest looking TransMetal would have to be Tarantulas.  Only complaint here is that the season is waaay too short.  Oh well, nice transition to the best season of the Beast Wars....Season Three.  Good Job Rhino, keep'em comin' and please bring Beast Machines to DVD!!",1080172800,,619,5.14
2012868,4,B0001LJCMU,"The second season tends to take a more dark and serious side of the Beast Wars storyline.  Though the second season was cut short of perfect litterally, it continues directly off season one which had to many elements to take to heart.  While season one carried many comedic moments, Season two has less of that with a darker tone.
With it's cheap and easy to afford price, Season Two is something all Tranformers fans should get on their wish list.  I recommend buying this if your Transformers, or the beastwars fan.",1079827200,,517,4.65934065934066
2012869,5,B0001LJCMU,"The second season of Beast Wars saw the introduction of Trans-Metals.  Some first season 'bots saw a Trans-metal transformation, while others died off, only to be replaced with new 'bots.
Episodes included are:
27) Aftermath: The alien machine is destroyed and Optimus went up with it, but the explosion sets off a quantum surge that changes the planet - and several of the robots. In his new, more powerful transmetal body, Megatron hopes to take out the Maximals before they have a chance to regroup and recover.
28) Coming of the Fuzors (1): Two new Maximals awake in Predacon territory, both with bizarre looks and unusual personalities due to the damaged systems in their stasispods. Taking advantage of their confusion, Megatron convinces them they are Predacons, hoping to finally crush the Maximals with these reinforcements. Meanwhile, Blackarachnia returns to the Predacon base with Tarantulas' body, Tigatron and Airrazor go of looking for more stasispods, Rhinox shuts down and connects to the Axalon in an attempt at reaching Optimus' spark, and Dinobot realizes that the aborted armageddon has left the planet looking awfully familiar.
29) Coming of the Fuzors (2): Hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned, Rattrap, Cheetor and Dinobot try to keep the Predacons away from the Axalon where Rhinox lies delving deep into the Matrix, pursuing a faint hope...
30) Tangled Web: Megatron sends out Tarantulas, Blackarachnia and Quickstrike to build an energon refueling station, though the spiders' scheming complicates even the simplest task.
31) Maximal, No More: Dinobot is captured while on a recognizance mission, and surprisingly asks Megatron for permission to rejoin the Predacons, offering the golden disk as proof of his sincerity.
32) Other Visits (1): While out surveying the planet, Airrazor and Tigatron trigger a remaining alien site. While the Maximals scramble to their rescue, Tarantulas is already on his way, determined to thwart the aliens' plans.
33) Other Visits (2): Surviving the energon surge thanks to their new transmetal bodies, Tarantulas sets up a shield around the alien construct and heads inside along with Megatron and Quckstrike. Outside, Optimus and Rattrap try to figure a way in, while the two other transmetalized Maximals return the wounded Rhinox and Dinobot the CR chambers
34) Bad Spark: Cheetor discovers a huge stasis pod, containing Protoform X - a failed Maximal experiment that created an indestructible spark but drove it insane in the process. When Predacons arrive, a fight breaks out over it, setting off an energon storm that leaves Blackarachnia and Silverbolt together damaged, having to fend for themselves - While Protoform X awakens, looking for a victim...
35) Code of Hero: Rhinox discovers that the Trans-Warp wave will soon reach Cybertron, meaning that a rescue may at long last be at hand. Megatron also learns of this, and decides that he will not surrender. Instead, Megatron uses the Golden Disk to destroy key details of the past that would severely alter the future. Meanwhile, Dinobot is still searching for a way to reclaim his lost honor. He gets the chance upon finding out Megatron's new target for destruction: The early human race.
36) Transmutate: A series of earthquakes uncovers a heavily damaged stasispod. Out of it comes a freakish robot - barely sentient, but with extremely powerful weapons. Scoffed at by the others, both Silverbolt and Rampage sense a kindred spirit, each in their own way.
37) The Agenda (1): As the transwarp wave generated by the explosion in ""Other Voices (2)"" nears Cybertron, the Maximals rejoice, thinking the rescue is on its way. But unbeknownst to them, it is intercepted and diverted by the leaders of the Cybertronian Predacon alliance, who view Megatron as a loose cannon and wants to deal with him quietly, by sending one of their covert operatives.
38) The Agenda (2): Megatron is captured, but the battle used up too much of the cruiser's energon supply for there to be enough for the travel back to Cybertron. While Ravage interrogates Megatron about where they might find more, Primal confronts Silverbolt about his relationship Blackarachnia, leading the Fuzor to go off on his own to find her.
39) The Agenda (3): The Maximals manage to take out the transwarp cruiser and fend of the Predacon attack. But the battle is far from over, as Megatron heads for the now uncovered Autobot Ark - containing the heroes and villains who'll shape the Cybertron where the Predacons and Maximals come from.",1077235200,50,4522,5.144021739130435
2012870,5,B0001LJCMU,"It wasn't until the DVD release of Beast Wars that I actually viewed the series in chronological order and saw some scenes removed from the US television and VHS versions. With the quantum surge, resulting in the `Transmetals' (which was never fully explained), the return of the aliens, two Fuzors and the dramatic three part adventure `The Agenda'... this was the best season of the three.",1077235200,4,391,4.9393939393939394
2012871,5,B0001LJCMU,"I would have to say that I am extremelly pleased that Rhino decided to continue to release the Beast Wars complete seasons.  This season is where the action truly picks up.  The only downfall to this season would have to be the fact that it is only 13 episodes, half of the first season.  Also, the death of Dinobot came as a disappointment to most fans of the series.(Although he does return in a new form in the third season.)  All in all, if you even just slightly enjoyed the first season, you will love this one.  The action is exciting and any Transformers or even animation fan shouldn't be without this title.  Code of Hero is my personal favorite episode in this season.",1077235200,,679,4.435483870967742
2012872,5,B0001LJCMU,"Even though The Beast War was done in the nineties, the graphics for The Beast Wars for animation was in its baby stage (1996 - 1999). I find I enjoyed the storyline and the graphics better than the new and improved Transformer Prime (2011 - 2012), which airs on cartoon network. The complete Beast War series was done with great passion and kept the story intense with many surprises.",1351641600,,385,4.594202898550725

2012875,5,B0001LJCMU,"Loved the second season! The story got really interesting near the end of the season, when a certain character from the original series makes an appearance! Season finale really had a nostalgiac feel.",1312243200,,200,5.090909090909091
2012876,5,B0001LJCMU,"I watched this show a whole bunch when I was little - and I was thrilled to see it available on DVD. After finishing season one I started hunting after season two...WHY is Season One only 14 dollars, but two and three cost HUNDREDS? That is insane. I'd pay that much for a box set of, say, a long running TV series such as the original transformers or MST3K - but for a single season? I am disappointed that I can't finish my collection due to someone's obvious greed. Total ripoff. Seriously - I found all three seasons in a collector's box set on Shoutfactory for 50 bucks. >_>.",1311120000,,580,4.330275229357798
2012877,5,B0001LJCMU,"The second season of Beast Wars Transformers, although picks up where the first season left off.  This season introduced some of the characters reformatted to what is better known as `TransMetals' as well as new kind of bots although that look weird in appearance better known as `Fuzors'.  While that Season 2, is only 13 episodes long, only half of what the first season was, but that don't mean that the writers didn't lack at all for this season.  Season 2 I feel they went about doing more story telling and was able to pull it off in only 13 episodes, though I feel that it could've been longer if they could've had more time to work with the season.  One of the things that people that have watched Generation 1, but not this series, will find the connections from this season of Beast Wars to Transformers Generation 1.  I won't give any spoilers as to what, though you may have to watch for yourself, though that this series has a lot of connections to that show yet bigger when it gets towards the end of the season.  A lot of people seemed to be upset about the `death' of one of the Maximals, and although it's weird how they managed to get a on screen death for a kid's show on television without having it censored in any way possible.  Overall I give this set 5 stars out of 5.",1280448000,,1292,4.33609958506224

  Here was a series that was well written in that it had a contiguous story but was still able to be watched as stand alone episodes successfully.  The dialog can be hokey at times but remember that this show was written for kids. Thankfully, however, it's done well enough so that adults can enjoy it as well.",1230768000,,514,4.626373626373627

2012884,4,B0001LJCMU,The spin off beastwars is pretty good.  This second season is also hard to find.,1201392000,,80,4.333333333333333
2012885,5,B0001LJCMU,"As the second season of Beast Wars begins, Optimus Primal is apparently dead, and a few of the Maximals (Cheetor and Rattrap) and Predacons (Megatron and Tarantulus) have undergone a ""transmetal"" transformation.  Not to mention that some of the Maximal stasis-pods have landed upon the planet, which also introduces the ""Fuzors"", Maximal Silverbolt and Predacon Quickstrike.  As the episodes unfold, Optimus returns (with a new, Transmetal form himself), Tigertron and Airrazor awaken the alien force watching all these events unfold, and we finally get to see just what's on that coveted gold disc.  The undoubtable highlight of the second season of Beast Wars is ""Code of Hero"", in which Predacon turned Maximal Dinobot heroically sacrifices himself to stop Megatron from wiping out the early human race.  Things get even better as the season comes to a close with a stunner of a revelation, that also manages to bridge the worlds of the original Transformers with that of Beast Wars.  This is where Beast Wars really came into it's own as a series and really defined itself apart from the original Transformers series that it was conceived from.  As the season closes on an even bigger cliffhanger than the season prior, viewers will be left salivating to see how everything comes together.  All in all, the second season of Beast Wars is spectacular, and believe it or not, things manage to get better after this.",1197158400,,1417,5.02991452991453

2012889,3,B0001LJCMU,"Beast Wars is one of the BEST television shows of the 1990s.  The characters, the scope -- it's something rarely seen in television at all, let alone children's television.

This was the season that made the series.  New characters born, tragic deaths and references to the vast history or the Transformers world.  Mixing humor with the heavy drama, season 2 was a monument of television.

However this particular DVD release from Rhino home video presents the show in a dissapointing manner.  The menus are hard to navigate, and there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES, except for about 30 seconds of test animation from season one.

Sony/BMG now owns the rights to the original Transformers cartoon, and is releasing it on DVD.  Presumably, they will do the same with Beast Wars, since Rhino home video has gone out of bussiness.  And if the Sony release of ""Transformers: The Movie"" (which came with several hours of special features)is any indication of what their Beast Wars release will be like, than it will indeed be worth waiting for.",1173312000,,1033,4.890804597701149
2012890,5,B0001LJCMU,"As the first season wrapped up, the Beast wars series was starting to hit its stide. The stories were good, episodes started to flow together, and characters were developing. The second season continues this and expands even more. This is my favorite string of episodes.  I caught the series just at the end of this season, which hooked me for the third season.  In the second season you get more plot and ongoing stories, and lots of action. And the tie in to the original transformer's series, briliant.  Ravage was a cool addition to the plot, a cassette still, but now a mercenary that speak.  It looks like other reviewers have done the plot summaries already for this season. All I can say it that it was the episodes in this season that got me hooked for the third season.  Check this set out transformer fans, affordable and fun.",1169078400,,837,4.590604026845638
2012891,4,B0001LJCMU,Probably the best all round season of all the transformers saga. The characters and plots are taken to the next level and the ongoing storylines are animation are amazing. The only drawback are some of the new beast modes (I am sure the were just bending to the needs of the toy manufacturers) as some of them were just not good. This is the season that all others should be held up to.,1146873600,4,386,4.301369863013699
2012892,5,B0001LJCMU,"For those of you who didn't like season 1 of the Beast Wars, don't let that cloud your judgement of getting this DVD set.  The Beast Wars plot picks up, becoming dramatic and suspenseful, especially for G1 fans like myself.  The environment of the show also becomes very dark, due to the fact that there is a plot with a direction and Megatron is actually evil in this season, as compared to his more annoying self in season 1.

I found the episode ""Code of Hero"" to be my favorite; a very powerful part of the series.  The cameos of G1 transformers in ""The Agenda"" series also put me on the edge of my seat.

Lastly, I'd just like to add that the creators of the show do a great job balancing the appeal to the show to kids and adult fans as well.  If you liked the original Transformers, you'll like this show.",1142640000,3,812,4.240259740259741

2012894,5,B0001LJCMU,"I won't go into the great depths that some of the other reviewers here have, other than to say that Beast Wars is a great series to watch whether you grew up on the old Transformers Sunbow cartoons 20 years ago as I did or whether you are a fan of the more recent shows such as Armada, Energon and Cybertron.

If you're like me, and you liked the old stuff, a few classic chcracters pop up during this season in cameo appearances, such as the original Megatron, Ravage and Optimus Prime.  The nice thing is that these characters don't totally steal the show, but what they do is make the regular Beast Wars characters look even better by the way they interact together.

If you are someone more used to the newer shows, you might recognize a lot of the voice actors because many of them are the same as those being used right now (like Megatron's, for example)

Also, the 3-D look now utilized in the Cybertron series was first introduced in Beast Wars, except that I feel it was done a little better here.  Instead of mixed anime and 3D, it's pure 3D.

If you've never seen any Beast Wars shows, you might want to purchase Season 1 first, although you can't go wrong with any of them.

I feel the Beast Wars Series is a little better than Beast Machines, and have reviewed that, also.",1138924800,3,1285,4.351464435146443
2012895,5,B0001LJCMU,"This season, while only half the length of the first, manages to become even better. This season introduces a new form of transformers, transfmetal. It also introduces two characters that have the combined traits of two animals at once, the Fuzors. All the characters that have gone transmetal also get an additional mode for their beast form, which generally allows for easier transportation and opens up a whole new wealth of combat situations, which the creative writing staff cover well.

Story-wise this season is incredible as well. Dinobot has a number of interesting episodes, imperitive to his character development and even including his final demise. Optimus Primal returns from the dead! And it has a number of ties to the original cartoon series as well, including the appearance towards the end of the last surviving decepticon, Ravage!

The incredible plot and action sequences that fill the beast wars series reach a whole new level with this season.",1130371200,2,966,5.146496815286624

2012897,4,B0001LJCMU,"Well, here it is: the second year of the Transformer show that brought about the resurection of the Transformer fandom, or atleast that's how I see it. After the low periods at the end of the original G1 period (which didn't even have a series to back it anymore as of 87), and the less than spectacular so-called ""Generation 2"", there really wasn't any show out there for fans to dig their teeth into, until Beast Wars came onto the scene in the mid 90's.

Many fans (myself included) didn't care for the fact that the new characters now had animals as their alternate modes, but many of us got used to it, as we got hooked on the show, seeing how well it turned out. I think some of the things that added to the sucess of the show was that it took steps away from what had already been done. Making the new characters beasts, cutting down the large amount of additional characters seen in the series and such. But the show usually tended to be written well, and will always be a remembered chapter in the various incarnations of the Transformers.

Season 2, in my opinion, is certainly not the least of the seasons of this show. I think my favorite season would be somewhere between seasons 2 and 3, I just picked up 2 because it happened first obviously.

The stories are good and it's awesome to be able to just watch the series just by selecting what episode I want to see from one of two discs.

The only thing about this set that I am a bit disapointed in is that not much effort was put into giving it extras. Aside from being able to watch the entire series through, or episodes individuall (or set sound options), the only other thing to do is watch clips on disc 2 of the models of the various characters in robot, beast mode, walking and transforming. In fact, there's only a mere fraction of the characters seen for each of these, the extras really were pathetic. I was hoping for some writer comentary about the direction they wated to go with season 2, ideas that were left on the cutting room floor, deleted scenes, and inspiration for new characters. Alas, none of this was included, it looks like they just put the episodes in there, decided ""hey, we have some room left over on disc 2, so lets just toss in some lame filler"" and did exactly that. The extras barely held 15 minutes of my attention.

Overall, if you're a fan of the series, or just want it for the episodes, this is a good set, just as long as you're not expecting much from the extras (which is the reason I gave it one star shy of 5 stars).",1108944000,,2526,4.320675105485232
2012898,5,B0001LJCMU,"My early impressions of Beast Wars were formed based on several toys that didn't exactly excite me. For someone who first knew the Transformers in the 1980s, perhaps it's too wide a cultural gap for me to accept Transformers being turned into animals. Still, I decided to give the animation series a try, and bought my first Beast Wars DVD three years ago, Atlantic Alliance's Beast Wars Classic Episodes Vol. 1. To my surprise, I actually enjoyed the show, and the rest, as they always said, is history.

I didn't buy Rhino's Beast Wars Season 1 DVD Boxset, because I was faithfully following the progress of the Alliance's Classic Episodes release. But when there were no signs of Alliance proceeding with more volumes, I decided to order Rhino's Season 2 Boxset. So, here I am, giving you a lowdown of what to expect from this latest release.

The episodes for Season 2 are as follow:

201 Aftermath

202 Coming of the Fuzors, Part One

203 Coming of the Fuzors, Part Two

204 Tangled Web

205 Maximal, No More

206 Other Visits, Part One

207 Other Visits, Part Two

208 Bad Spark

209 Code of Hero

210 Transmutate

211 The Agenda, Part One

212 The Agenda, Part Two

213 The Agenda, Part Three

It's difficult to run through a section about episodes without revealing some spoilers. Do pardon me if I reveal too much. It has now been established that the Beast Wars were indeed happening on a prehistoric planet Earth. The Maximals and Predacons, who're descendants of the Autobots and Decepticons respectively, have unwittingly travelled back in time, when Earth was the target of an alien experiment. Think about the movie ""Back to the Future"", or simply, imagine your current self being transported back to a time when your grandfather is a young kid. You get the picture. It's therefore all the more interesting to see the sequences unfold. The following are just some of my recommended episodes.

Picking up the pieces from an abruptly concluded Season 1, ""Aftermath"" documented the transition of some Transformers into ""Transmetals"", due to a quantum surge. The gloomy atmosphere in the Maximals' camp, following the supposedly destruction of Optimus Primal, was very well rendered. We get to see very distinctive character developments in the ways how Rattrap, Cheetor, Rhinox and Dinobot handled their leader's death.

""The Coming of Fuzors"" two-parter wrapped up the loose ends from earlier episodes, as well as introduced two new characters in the form of Silverbolt and Quickstrike. These episodes liberally employed a ""western cowboy"" style of story-telling, which is a joy to watch. Of course, the return of Optimus Primal saved the day for the Maximals, again!

""Code of Hero"" is perhaps one of the best Transformers episode I've ever watched. It featured the death of a fan favorite, the Predacon-turned-Maximal Dinobot. His shocking departure will rank as the best death scenes in any Transformers episode, outdoing even G1 Optimus Prime's death in Transformers: The Movie. Dinobot single-handledly took on the entire Predacons army in protecting humanity, and died a hero that he always aspire to be. The impact of his death was as compelling as the first time I watched the show.

And of course, ""The Agenda"" three-parter provided the most blatant linkage of the Beast Wars series to the original G1 story. We saw the appearance of the G1 Decepticon Ravage and the many cameos of G1 characters like Optimus Prime, Soundwave, etc., and we rejoiced that an excellent animated series like this has finally went into history as being an official continuation of the great G1 series. These are episodes that you'd want to watch again and again, because just by the sheer thought of mentioning, I'm already experiencing goose pimples.

There are more action that I could ever pen from these 13 episodes. The relationship between Silverbolt and Blackarchnia was also an interesting subplot, as well as the evil schemes of Tarantulus. In short, you could very well be tempted to watch all 13 episodes at one go, which I did! If you need to read detailed sypnosis and comments on all the episodes, you may visit Ben Yee's BWTF.com.

For a DVD Boxset, the special features are pretty flat. We're given a 360 degrees characters shots, close-up headshots/ poses, scale reference charts and some transformation sequences. Sadly, none of these are narrated, and it really does get very boring after a minute. Perhaps an inclusion of episodes introductions, or some interviews with the creators of the show would have make this more enjoyable.

Excellent story-telling and some compelling action sequences made Beast Wars Season 2 one of the best animated series ever. For those who've yet to watch the show at all, I suggest getting all three season boxsets and enjoy the ride. For those who have, take this opportunity to get a re-introduction. This is a highly recommended product.",1108252800,8,4893,4.9693627450980395
2012899,5,B0001LJCMU,"Beast wars season 2, prbably the best season but I don't remember it only being as long as 2 dvds but anyway. The series starts of in the same minute that the first ended, with optimus getting blown up to save the planet, wich is later descovered to be earth. The story becomes more developed in this season with some episodes that are really well written (code of hero) and they even threw in some romance. This season also introduces alot more characters like the fuzors(quickstrike and silverbolt) and new transmetals (rampage). there are also characters who are taken out of the beast wars, i won't ruin it for you. Again with all the seasons there is some packaging problems. The first is that they have optimus's face on disc on but megtrons picture behind it...wait...thats it. But it's still really cool to watch it again.",1107648000,,830,4.691780821917808
2012900,5,B0001LJCMU,"Firstly, Beast Wars was a pioneer in CGI animation on a regular television show, and was a worthy successor of the OG Transformers for all kids that grew up in the late 80's/early 90's. Regarding the box set, Season Two is the Empire Strikes Back of Beast Wars. If you know what happens in the ""Code of Hero"" episode, you know this set is worth getting. This is THE essential Beast Wars Volume. After Season 2, the series jumped the shark anyway so just pick up the first two and then erase any memory you have of *shudder* Beast Machines.",1100822400,,539,4.4
2012901,5,B0001LJCMU,"Beast wars finally figures out that it will not pander to an audience of children in second season and instead decides to aim itself at the 20-30 something generation 1 crowd.  The result is a more violent and horrific series.  It is still a great show to watch with your kids, but now the parent gets as much satisfaction from the show as the child.

The transmetal plot line carries over well.  The new bodies and transforms are great as the beast wars is taken to the next level.  Also the comedy is still readily apparent.  Examples include but are not limited to:  Rat Trap calling his motor cycle mode ""Kinevil Mode"" . . .

The addition of the decepticons adds depth to second season, as well as the plot tye in with the ark.  All in all a great season.

Inferno and ""The spider"" (I cant spell his name) are the best!
and Rampage!

2012906,5,B0001LJCMU,"I'm not going to bother with giving you a break down of the episodes, since you're looking at this you should know what they are. But rather my flat out opinion of this DVD set.
Beast Wars was a show that like a fine wine, got better with age.
The first season was more for the kids, where this season really got back to the roots of the Transformers for us older fans, and the stories are great. One thing I noticed about Beast Wars was the fact it was not as toy driven as G1, you were introduced to new characters (toys) for the sake of storyline only, not have 10 characters all of a sudden crammed into an episode. Beast Wars stayed primarely with it's starting characters, developing great personalities for each one, you actually cared for these guys. The ""Code of a Hero"" episode for example.
The voice acting also is top notch, great talent used for this show.
The animation is far much better than the first season and gets even better in the third, my favorite of the three.
It's great to see this series uncut, Fox Kids butchered some episodes, and that definitly ruined the impact of some stories.
My only complaint is the lack of special features on the disc, but that's a small price to pay to finally get one of the best CG series out on DVD. Hurry up Rhino. The fans await season 3.
And I want to give Amazon.com a big ""Hooah!!!"" for delivering my order and some much needed entertainment to us troops serving in Kuwait & Iraq.",1081814400,10,1444,4.351851851851852
2012907,5,B0001LJCMU,"This season is a great step up from the 1st season. This season we saw improved 3D Graphics, Improved Surround Sound, and of course better writing. Season 1 was good, but this season was much better. The depth of the writing was incredible. ""Code of Hero"" and ""Transmutate"" are standouts. These 2 shows were so good they had me choked up towards the end. The way the writers bridged the gap from G1 Transformers to The Beast Wars was phenomenal and caught most people by surprise. Megatron's Megalomania has also been kicked up a few notches. He is by far the most entertaining Transformers Character of all time! His voice alone is mesmerizing, the way he speaks to his troops is hilarious. David Kay, who does his voice deserves an Emmy for doing it so well for 5 seasons (3 seasons for Beast Wars, 2 for Beast Machines).
 With that said about season 2, all I can tell you is...Season 3 is even better! Optimus Primal gets an incredible new Transmetal 2 Body (Optimal Optimus) & Megatron get a new body as well (Dragon Megatron). Buy this DVD, and when Season 3 comes out grab it as soon as it drops!",1081036800,3,1102,4.482587064676617
2012908,5,B0001LJCMU,"I've been a TransFan for as far back as I can remember.  I remember the good old days, watching Optimus Prime beat the living snot out of Megatron, and then reliving the battles with my worn out action figures...yes, those were the days.  Sadly, Transformers slowly faded from the airwaves and store shelves, and I was forced to move on to other hobbies.  Fast forward to the mid-to-late 90's.  I was entering middle school, and it was now that I heard some shocking news.  Transformers was returning in a new series known as ""Beast Wars"".  Needless to say, I was skeptical about the quality at first.  I wasn't too sure I liked the new designs, and to have all of my favorite Autobots and Decepticons scrapped was quite a gamble.  But then I saw the series premiere...and I was hooked.  The blend of CG action and amazing characters was magical.
As great as season 1 was however, season 2 blew it away.  These episodes contain the maturation of Transformers for a new audience.  From political trechery to death, the topics were a lot more complex and powerful.  This season contains the now classic ""Code of Hero"", which successfully killed off one of the most popular characters in the series while creating some of the most well crafted diologue in animated history.  Also contained in this season is the 3 part masterpiece known as ""The Agenda"", finally linking everything back to Generation 1 Transformers and giving the season a finale that is not often seen.  This is not only the best season of Beast Wars, but one of the greatest sets of animated features available, second only to the classic Generation 1 cartoon.  I don't think I need to say it, but I will anyway.  Buy this set.",1080950400,,1692,4.646464646464646
2012909,5,B0001LJCMU,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS
Ok, season two picked up right where season one left off with the death of Optimus Primal, however a 'quantum surge' hits the planet pretty hard and permanently changes the landscape as well as what might be called 'forceably upgrading' several of the Maximals and Predacons into transmetals. Right in the first ten minutes of the first episode Terrorsaur and Scorponok are killed. This season was much more mature in terms of content and storylines then the first season, the ominous fate of Tigertron and Airrazor, the heroic death of Dinobot, as well as one of the finest episodes ever ""Transmutate"" this contains very mature themes about respect for all forms of life, and if I'm not mistaken was the writers way of commenting on how we treat the mentally and physically handicapped in our society. The series centerpiece is there ""Code Of Hero"" which is about accepting the responsibility for your actions as witnessed in the heroic albeit depressing death of Dinobot (my favorite character), as well as pointing out the fact that war has consequences which is something that is rarely discussed in a 'kids' show. Then of course we have the three part ""Agenda"" episodes, featuring the return of the Decepticon Ravage from the original 1984 Transformers series as well as cameos by G1 Autobots and Decepticons, what emerges is a powerful tribute to the original series something thst in my opinion became a huge part of American culture. All in all a great season to own with great ideas and episodes, this proves that what is normally labeled as a 'childrens series' can indeed be thought provoking as well as entertaining to people who are my age. I highly recommend this in addition to season one.",1080432000,3,1731,4.911262798634812
2012910,4,B0001LJCMU,"the second season is the best of all seasons for beast wars. ALOT of action is seen, along with great episodes..my favorite personally is ""the agenda pts 1-3"". Most of the episodes in season 2 deal or have reference to the orginal transformers. What would have been better was to see season 2 and 3 all in one, they were both too short, putting them together would have been atleast the same # of episodes as season 1.

8014227,5,B0001LJCMU,"This is a great box set, I think beast wars is way better than the original transformers series, it is more engaging and the story lines are more Sci-Fi, the characters are have more depth and the story lines are way more thought provoking, adults would enjoy the series as well, I have the original transformers complete DVD set as well and though i think the original transformers are also pretty good, there are times (as an adult) where i feel that the original series is a little boring and not as interesting in its story lines (I mean makes sense because it was designed for children) but this series never really felt that way the beast wars is awesome and ties in the original transformers time line into this series in a really cool way, check out the series online, as for this box set i purchased it and i think its a good one I know there is a newer one out as well that is cheaper",1514160000,,894,4.295857988165681
