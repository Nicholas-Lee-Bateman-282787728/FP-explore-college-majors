8367223,4,B002EAYE74,"Just caught this on TCM.  With three of my favorites (Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray, and Ward Bond) I figured it should be pretty decent.  I was right.  The plot line is Western predictable: cattle rustling (although you never see one), bank robbery, a hanging, some revenge, and pursuit sequences.  Stanwyck plays her usual strong woman role, deputized and out for justice.  (Her ""You don't look so spry"" comment made me laugh out loud.)  Fred MacMurray does a decent job as usual playing the bad guy you can't dislike.  (He's also good in Face of a Fugitive a movie that is hard to find.)  It held my attention most likely because of the strength of the actors.  The waterfall sequence was pretty good and Stanwyck's wet slide was pretty realistic.  One heck of an actress.  The only thing I found annoying was in some of the chase sequences and at the end of the film the music was inappropriate--it sounded more like music for a romp in the park.  The ending was fairly predictable but all in all, this is a good western.  I'll keep it on my DVR for a while.",1523404800,,1065,4.513089005235602

8367226,5,B002EAYE74,"A wonderful movie with Stanwyck and MacMurry play in. He is a Moonlighter and gets shot. She vows that if anything happens to Mac Murray's brother she would come after him, and she does. But not before she realizes she still loves him, but wants him to be honest.",1415664000,,263,4.387755102040816

8367228,3,B002EAYE74,"Odd little western (originally filmed in 3D) directed by Roy Rowland seems split into two parts which seem to have little to do with each other. In the first half, a lynch mob breaks down the jail to hang a cattle rustler (Fred MacMurray), who rustles by moonlight hence the title, but they hang the wrong man! MacMurray takes it upon himself to avenge the innocent man. There's a bizarre flashback that seems totally out of place as if someone decided the film needed a comic respite. The second half focuses on the two brothers (MacMurray, William Ching) both in love with the same woman (Barbara Stanwyck) and the bank robbery that proves disastrous to all involved, only this time it's Stanwyck who takes it upon herself to get revenge. Considering it was filmed in 3D, there's very little (outside of a brawl with fists and chairs flying) ""in your face"" 3D effects.

The Warners Archives DVD is a crisp B&W transfer in the appropriate 1.33 ratio.",1316476800,7,951,4.6946107784431135
