359193,5,6301798201,"When I first saw this movie, on a friend's recommendation, I didn't know what to expect - and it completely blew me away! Good - we want a movie to engage us. And there are plenty that do the first time through. But I feel one test of a movie's power is its ability to touch us and get a reaction after multiple viewings. Each time I watch ""The Ox-Bow Incident,"" I am on the edge of my chair, wanting to jump in and prevent the mob from making a tragic mistake. But I have to sit there, frustrated, knowing exactly what is coming but powerless to change it. Watch this movie; it will keep you human.",998611200,4,599,4.128205128205129
359194,5,6301798201,"Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan make a swell pair of drifters!  They stumble into a town recently ravaged by rustlers and are forced to join an unruly, lynching mob.  The film's visual imagery is both poetic and startling.  This movie is all about shadows and the reactions on people's faces; watch Anthony Quinn, that cat is cool as a cucumber!  Director William Wellman races the viewer through a fast-paced morality play, and we are left to judge the characters' behavior for ourselves.  What will happen in the end?  Ooh, if this film was a book (which it once was), it'd be a real page-turner!",984355200,4,595,4.673076923076923
359195,5,6301798201,"Considered by western purists not to be a 'real' western. Mainly because of its passive hero, lack of action and dramatic power. Well maybe it isn't  a 'true' western but it's definitely a memorable one. Among the best and  most powerful westerns ever made it remains an unforgettable and  unflinching account on the tyranny of mob rule. Henry Fonda is great as Gil  Martin, a drifter who happens to hang around for a lynching but also bares  witness to the inhumanity and stubbornness of a lynch mob who hang three  innocent suspects. Fonda was in peak form when he made this small little  known western, just three years after 'The Grapes Of Wrath', one wonders  why he bothered to make this small western that tries to make a difference,  maybe he agreed with the moral and waned to make a statement. Dana Andrews  and a young Anthony Quinn are the unlucky suspects. An unforgettable  western that was directed with cold realism by William A. Wellman which  separates it from the usual 'cowboys and indians' fare. Intense, powerful  and fast paced. Also short (only 75 min.) but that's enough to make a  chilling and unforgettable movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  9!",965001600,5,1184,4.679611650485437
359196,5,6301798201,"This a great movie where Henry Fonda showed his great acting skills. Mr. Fonda was great in roles where he had to display his persuasive ability. He, along with Harry Morgan(Mash's Colonel Potter) horsedbacked into town  to find themselves in the middle of a problem of cattlemen having problems  with cattle rustling. The townfolk are ready to handle this murderous  situation by pressing for lynching instead of by the regular means of trial  by jury. The movie shows all kinds of personalities with their reasons why  they feel lynching is the right or wrong method of handling the matter. For  example,Major Tetley is for lynching not so much for thinking that  cattlerustling is bad, but because he wants to personally make a man out of  his cowardice son. Take Mr. Davies, a storekeeper, who feels we must do  things by trial of jury and act in a  reasonable legitimate manner. Take  Farnley, the  buddy of the murdered man. He is so angry he would have  handled it swiftly by lynching without having the facts. Take Henry  Fonda-who feels we must give these 3 innocent men charged with  cattlerustling a chance to be heard. Take Sparks-he is against lynching  because he saw his own brother being lynched. Take Moore, how he came to  side with the trial by jury side is a mystery in itself, but you wish there  were more men like him in the end. They hang them. Dana Andrews was great in  asking to have time to write a letter back home read later by Fonda to tell  his loved ones that he would not be there for them anymore. What a sad time  to see these men hang for something they did not do just because the  majority of men plus one woman wanted to get the job over quick. This  situation could have happened in another setting not just in a western.  Makes you want to sit down and cry but to decide what side you would have  been on in this situation. This is a great movie simply because it has a  message to tell us-Let us not act in haste until we know all the facts and  give those a chance being accused their day in court. Buy the movie  friends-and get ready to decide on this matter. Will it be the quick  hanging method of justice or the slow time taking trial by jury method?

359197,5,6301798201,"The Ox-Bow Incident is the best film that I have seen to look at the dynamics and mentality of a mob.  In this story, three innocent men are captured and accused of the death of a rancher.  Although Henry Fonda, a  drifter, tries to change the mind of the mob, everyone wants  ""justice"".  The lives of three men hang in the balance.  Fonda,  as usual, is excellent in his role of the man trying to convince the  others, similar in a way to his role in 12 Angry Men.  Dana Andrews, as one  of the accused men, gives a heartfelt, unusually emotional performance.  The movie is short (75 minutes), which means the action moves at a good  pace, and the black and white photography adds to the starkness of the  whole situation.  This is a western that takes a sharp look at how mobs  function, and it presents a lot of unfortunate truths.",951523200,8,834,4.359477124183006

These were probably because it was filmed in the 1940s when  it would have been unheard of to not have a classic hero (Fonda) or to let murderers off the hook (the posse).  It is well worth watching, nevertheless, but read the book for a somewhat different perspective on characters such as Gil, Davies, Art, etc.",1469750400,,403,4.647887323943662
359514,2,6301798201,"Okay, The Ox-bow Incident is a ground-breaking classic with stellar performances from Henry Fonda, Harry Morgan and Dana Andrews; a peerless example of director, William A. Wellman's supreme handling of decidedly taboo and very unflattering subject matter. It's the 'one of a kind' prestige pic Hollywood of old used to gamble on every now and then, hoping against hope such efforts would catch the public fancy and make money. More often than not, they didn't - The Ox-Bow Incident being no exception. Time has been very kind to the movie's reputation.

But time has equally been cruel to these elements. I am really at a loss to explain what went wrong in mastering this disc. But what's here is VERY softly focused, contrast weaker than anticipated, with an occasional patina or haze afflicting the presentation. Not impressed, despite the advertised ""new 4K scan"" tag (frankly, the only reason I bought this disc, believing I was getting some real bang for my buck). Instead, the image is generally dull, if free of age-related artifacts. If I had to guess, I would place the blame squarely on some heavy-handed DNR that has taken a lot of the fine details and virtually all of the indigenous grain out of this transfer. Bottom line: passable if you don't this movie in any other format. But honestly, it looks about as good on DVD.",1469404800,8,1336,4.834061135371179

359516,1,6301798201,"Releasing a classic on blu-ray without English subtitles earns this release one star as far as Im concerned. AUTOMATIC FAIL. Yes, Im duly grateful to Kino for releasing Gorky Park with English subtitles, but I have subtitles on my Fox DVD of Oxbow Incident, so whats Kinos rationale for omitting them from this blu-ray? Money? I don't see how, especially if the studio factors in all the potential buyers that are going to pass up this release because of the lack of subtitles.

English subtitles are absolutely necessary for millions whose hearing is impaired for whatever reason, for millions like my wife who are non-native English speakers, and for those like myself, who just like to watch movies at low volume, late at night, with the subtitles turned on.

When will Kino wise up to the fact that including English subtitles means more profits for them? Well, Im not holding my breath, but I am holding onto my money.

I see that Olive Films is going to release a 4K blu-ray version of High Noon with English subtitles in September.

Then another man arrives to report that Kinkaid, a popular local rancher had been shot in the head at his ranch. This stirs up the town to create a lynch mob, but a couple go to the local judge to have him try to defuse the situation. The sheriff unfortunately is away at Kinkaid's ranch, so the deputy is in charge. They all join the group, who go into the nearby mountains where they believe the outlaws are.

En route, they find people traveling in a wagon-the woman the drifter was supposed to marry and the man she actually did marry (but nothing comes further of this plot point). The find the cattle with Kinkaid's brand-and three men camped nearby. They proclaim their innocence, but one of the campers is recognized as a wanted outlaw-and statements made by the others arouse the posse's suspicions. Will they go ahead and just lynch them?

359612,5,6301798201,"I was very impressed by this film.  I read how it was one of Clint Eastwood's favorites and other stars had given it high praise and being a fan of Westerns, I thought I would check it out and I am glad I did.

The premise is simple.  Two cowboys ride into a little town and learn that a rancher has been murdered and they are asked to join up with the posse to go after the murderers.  As they do so, however, it seems that some of the posse might be too fixated on revenge to think with any kind of reason.

This is a short movie at just over an hour, and wastes no time in delivering some excellent drama and intrigue.  This is one that I link a bit to Hang 'Em High for the simple fact that a group amasses to string up those who may or may not be guilty.  Perhaps there was some influence there.

If you enjoy Westerns, I really don't see how you can wrong here.  Plus, there is an excellent documentary on the life and career of Henry Fonda.  Enjoy!",1454976000,,955,4.005291005291006

For those familiar with Henry Fonda's portrayal in Twelve Angry Men you will see a similar character a decade plus earlier.  This has all the classic elements still relevant to today's society.  The story mirrors how quickly we rush to judgement without the need to find further facts.  There are numerous character types indicative of society represented.  The best attribute of the movie is its ability to make you think and look at justice.  It is never black and white, but mitigating shades.  This movie so beautifully displays the moral quandary with crime and justice and its role in a rational society that is too often run and fueled by emotion.",1425427200,2,796,4.9772727272727275
359702,3,6301798201,"m not one for early cinema, as I find most films prior to 1970 to be way over the top. The Ox-Bow had it's fair share of over the top cliche, but it also vividly illustrates a time in American history we don't learn much about. American history is often about the wars and the personalities, simple things like the wild west are left to films known as Westerns. The vast majority of these films tend to tell stories of historic figures, or focus on shoot outs and war, but Ox-bow stands apart, as it shows just how wild the frontier was. Taking place in 1885, the Ox-Bow incident follows the residents of a small town, who decide to take justice into their own hands following the murder of one of their own. Despite warnings from the local judge and sheriff, the towns people form a posse, and search for the men responsible, and they find them in an area known as the Ox-Bow. Once these men are found, the posse is divided and must decide which is the proper method of justice. I don't like Westerns, but I enjoyed the Ox-Bow, because it is just so radically different from every other film of this type and despite the cliches, it gives a real depiction of the problems the government faced when trying to tame the west. The legendary Henry Fonda stars in an era when it was very easy to tell a good actor from a bad one. He was level headed and didn't do things completely over the top, but the same can't be said for the rest of the cast. Perhaps the most interesting thing to see just how much Fonda style stood out and how it still resonates today in the performances of people like George Clooney. The other styles of acting portrayed have long since gone to the waste side, but Fonda's endures, showing that he was good enough to stand the test of time. The Ox-Bow isn't the most exciting film you'll ever see, in fact, many thing just don't make sense, but it still remains one of the defining accounts of the ordinary citizens of the wild west. People are still talking about it 70 years later and I suspect they'll still be talking about 70 years from now as it has to be included in any discussion of early American cinema.",1424649600,,2136,4.355889724310777

Sounds like some recent cases in the media where innocent people are incarcerated because of a District Attorney's  zeal to make gains to their egos.

359861,4,6301798201,"Recently I read a list of the top western films of all time.  I had no issues with the list but this 75 minute masterpiece somehow missed my attention for all these years.  Taking advantage of a nice 4-Disc package of films by 20th Century Fox, I watching this William Wellman film for the first time.

Henry Fonda, already an established star, plays Gil Carter a cowboy coming to the local dusty cattle town to find his girl and a bottle of whiskey, not necessarily in that order.  His pal Art (Henry Morgan) is along for the ride and tries to keep him out of trouble.  When a rumor spreads that one of the town's popular ranchers has been killed and his cattle rustled, a group of townsfolk decide they must form a posse and chase down the varmints.  But there will be no namby pamby trial by jury.

The strong willed sheriff is out of town on another assignment, so the weak authority figure of the deputy essentially hands over the leadership to a retired major, still suited up in his Confederate uniform well past the ""good-by-date.""  The 3 dozen or so cowpokes quickly come upon 3 hombres (Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn and Paul Hurst) asleep by a campfire.  With no proof but plenty of vengeance the mob decides to put the suspect's guilt or innocence up to a vote.  Only 7 vote not to hang but return to town for trial.  The rest vote to hang them on the spot.

While Fonda's character quietly protests, the actor will handle a similar responsibility in a film years later (""12 Angry Men"").  The acting in the film is top-notch with Fonda's grit with a streak of meanness hiding an unqualified sense of fair play.  I would also point out Andrew's impassioned plea of innocence certainly convincing.  The film is a sad but historical fact of life at the time.  One that continues to play out even in the 21st century.",1375056000,,1823,4.4787878787878785

The Picture Quality is maybe not perfect but good.

359869,5,6301798201,"I cannot praise this movie highly enough!  Directed by the always-brilliant and underrated William Wellman, who was always viewed as a sort of workmanlike journeyman director and not a ""visionary,"" this film manages to say a great deal about American values and moral crises within the context of a deceptively simple tale.

Fonda returns to town with his pal, the always-rewarding Harry Morgan (remember Colonel potter in ""Mash""?), having just discovered that his true love has jilted him for a San Francisco dandy.  In his anger and frustration, he initially takes part in a posse that takes off to punish a trio of men that are believed to be the murderers and robbers of beloved townsman Henry Kinkaid.

The tragedy that ensues is a stark drama of justice gone horrible wrong and trampled by mass hysteria and the kind of fear and accusations against the 'bad guys""--foreigners, strangers and the mentally ill---that are always fomented by the right wing.  What Wellman establishes so brilliantly is how a public event becomes a canvas upon which people often project their own psychological issues.

For example, the first time I saw this movie I thought that the scene in which Fonda's ex-girlfriend comes through the pass with her new fiance was totally superfluous.  It didn't seem to have much to do with the tale.  How wrong I was!  After multiple viewings, it became clear to me that it was Fonda's sexual humiliation at the hands of the woman that contributed to his desire to take part in the ""macho"" ritual of capturing and punishing ""bad guys.""  Wellman shows how many of the film's principals are using the ""Oxbow Incident"" to work out their own demons.  Tetley, for instance, seems to be obsessed with the concept of 'manhood"" and every other word out of his mouth is an accusation against one of the other characters---particularly his own weakling son---that he is a ""woman"" or ""not man enough.""  Talk about issues!  Then there is the female member of the posse, striving to show that she can out-tough any man.

Fonda comes to realize that the bloodlust in the posse is folly and he bows out of it, realizing that he cannot salve the injustice he feels he has suffered by inflicting same on others.  The devastating outcome of the mob hysteria and rush to judgment that ensue, are a powerful and unforgettable lesson in the horrors of vigilantism.  Not to be missed!",1323216000,,2386,4.825552825552825
359870,5,6301798201,"This is not your typical western.  At the time it was released, 1943, it was the darkest western that had ever come out.  The story is very grim, with a powerful message about the danger of lawless democracy.  ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is one of the best safeguards in our legal system, but reason gets thrown out the window sometimes, and that remains a danger in every time period.  At the time this was released, the contemporary violations of this principle were race riots/lynchings and internment of Japanese-Americans.  I think the cinematography is excellent, adding a heaviness to the whole movie through the camera lighting and angles.  I usually stay away from tragic stories, but when they have excellent themes and inspire you to be more careful about what you do to others, like this one, they are worth watching.  This DVD also has an A & E Biography about Henry Fonda.  Fonda witnessed a lynching when he was young, and this movie was the most powerful way he could express his anger toward injustice.",1320451200,5,1022,4.8
359951,5,6301798201,"This is one of the very first ""revisionist"" westerns and shares many of the film noir qualities that were popular in 40s films. It was based on a successful 1940 novel by Walter Van Tilberg Clark (1909-71). The film was actually made in 1941 but not released until 1943.

Time: 1885. Location: Small town in Nevada.

Two men ride into town to learn that a local rancher has been killed and his cattle rustled. A posse sets out to catch and hang the men, despite the opposition of some of the townspeople who want them arrested and returned to town for a fair trial.

Henry Fonda (1905-82) plays one of the two men who ride along with the posse. Fonda needs little introduction. AFI lists him as the 6th Greatest Male Star of All Time. He won one Oscar (""On Golden Pond"") and was nominated for 2 more (""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""12 Angry Men""), plus 3 Emmy nominations, 2 Golden Globe nominations, and he won a Tony for ""Mister Roberts"" (1948). Along with ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""Mister Roberts"", and ""12 Angry Men"", this was Fonda's favorite film.

Director Wellman said ""Six weeks before we started...he wardrobed himself...and then lived and probably slept in it. The boots, the Levis, the hat, the shirt, the bandanas, became a part of Gil Carter...not Hank Fonda because Hank had become Gil. He looked it, talked it, felt it, and, by the time we were ready to shoot the picture, smelled it, and his performance was perfection""

FWIW - The day after he completed this film, Fonda enlisted in the Navy.

Fonda's sidekick is Harry Morgan (1915) who is best known for his years as Sgt. Bill Gannon on ""Dragnet"" (1967-70) and his Emmy winning role as Col. Sherman T. Potter on ""M*A*S*H"" (1975-83). This was Morgan's film debut, although it appears as his sixth film because of its late release.

The suspects include Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn, and Francis Ford.

Dana Andrews (1909-92) appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in ""The Westerner"" (1941), ""Laura"" (1944), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946). Years later he described his role as ""my most satisfying experience"".

Anthony Quinn (1915-2001) plays a Mexican.  In 1943 he was still a supporting player although he had been in more than 20 films and had done well in ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941) as an Indian, and ""Blood and Sand"" (1941) as a Spaniard. His big break wouldn't come until 1952 opposite Marlon Brando in ""Viva Zapata"". Quinn, of course, left us a great legacy of more than 100 roles, with films like ""Zorba the Greek"" (1961), ""Lust for Life"" (1956), and ""Wild is the Wind"" (1957). He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, winning twice for Best Supporting Actor.

Francis Ford (1881-1953) was John's older brother. He was a writer and a director and also an actor, appearing in more than 400 films including several films directed by his younger brother. This was his biggest screen role, and he is great.

The posse of 28 includes Frank Conroy, Jane Darwell, and Marc Lawrence. Harry Davenport joins them, but tries to get them to bring the men back to town for a fair trial.

Marc Lawrence (1910-2005) is the main force starting the posse. Pock-faced Lawrence was best known for his gangster roles in films like ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942), ""Dillinger"" (1945), and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950). He was victimized during the McCarthy era and his film roles shrank.

Frank Conroy (1890-1964) plays a former Confederate Major who takes control of the posse. He appeared in 50+ films between 1930 and 1961 with roles in ""The Naked City"" (1948) and ""The Snake Pit"" (1948).

Jane Darwell (1879-1967) is another hanging enthusiast. She's best known for her 7 films with John Ford and her Oscar winning performance in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940) as Ma Joad (Henry Fonda played her son). She was much in demand and made more than 200 films between 1913 and 1964.

Harry Davenport (1866-1949) plays the voice of reason and humanity. He gave us great performances as Dr. Meade in ""GWTW"" (1939), King Louis XI in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Col. Skeffington in ""Kings Row"" (1942), and Grandpa in ""Meet Me in St Louis"" (1944).

Look for Margaret Hamilton (1902-85) in a brief cameo as the Judge's housekeeper. She's best known as the wicked witch from ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939).

William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman (1986-1975) directs. Wellman was nominated 4 times for an Oscar, winning for Best Writer in 1938 (""A Star is Born""). He was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA for ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954). During WW 1 Wellman was an aviator and made several air warfare films, such as ""Wings"" (1927), ""Men with Wings"" (1938), ""Thunder Birds"" (1942), and ""Lafayette Escadrille"" (1958). Despite his preference for the air force, he also made films about the infantry  - ""Battleground"" (1949) and ""Darby's Rangers"" (1958) - and the navy - ""Blood Alley"" (1955) and ""This Man's Navy"" (1945). Among his non war films are such classics as ""Beau Geste"" (1939) with Gary Cooper and Brian Donlevy, and ""Public Enemy"" (1931) with Jimmy Cagney.  Wellman was one our greatest directors and he shows his talents in this film. Each individual scene is a thing of beauty, carefully crafted, and matching the best work of even the masters such as Ford and Kubrick.

FWIW - Wellman battled hard with Zanuck to get this ""depressing"" film made. Ultimately he had to agree to do ""lesser"" films for Zanuck in order to have this one made.

Arthur C Miller (1895-1970) provides great black and white photography. He was nominated for an Oscar 7 times and won 3 times - ""Anna and the King of Siam"" (1946), ""The Song of Bernadette"" (1943), and ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941). He was a favorite of John Ford who used him in many of his movies, starting with ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937), but curiously enough Ford never used Miller on one of his westerns.

The film looks a little studio bound, but that was because producer Darryl F. Zanuck wanted to do it on the cheap (Fonda was a big star yet he worked for scale). Wellman shopped the script around to everyone, but only Zanuck had the courage to go ahead, but he wanted to hedge his bets and insisted on a studio production to keep costs low. The result was the largest set ever constructed by Fox.

Of course having Zanuck (1902-79) as your producer was not necessarily a bad thing. He was nominated for an Oscar twice - ""G-Men"" (1935) and ""The Longest Day"" (1962) - and among his nearly 200 films are such notables Oscar winners as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941), ""Gentleman's Agreement"" (1947), ""Twelve O'Clock High"" (1949) and ""Pinky"" (1949). He once said - We are in this business primarily to provide entertainment, but in doing so we do not dodge the issue if we can also provide enlightenment.

FWIW - Fonda hated Zanuck but Wellman said ""I admired him for his guts and the quality he had of grabbing and generating the speed and enthusiasm all down the line to make a good picture quickly - at this, he was a master...""

1943 was an OK year in films - The top grossing films included ""This is the Army"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Coney Island"", and ""Stage Door Canteen"". The big Oscar winner was ""Going My Way"", and other winners included ""Gaslight"" and ""None But the Lonely Heart""

Western films were popular in the early 40s - ""Mark of Zorro"" (1940), ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941) - but by 1943 they were out of favor. The only other notable western released in 1943 was ""the Outlaw"".

The film was nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Picture"" but received no other nominations - a very rare event (only ""Grand Hotel"" and ""One Foot in heaven"" share this distinction). The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called the film ""as brazen a gesture as any studio has ever indulged"" and ""it has the virtue of uncompromising truth."" He praised Willman's direction for being ""as sharp and cold as a knife"" and noted that ""an all-round excellent cast has played the film brilliantly.""

Coming as it did in the early 40s, the novel and the film had obvious implications for the fascist governments in Europe. Fritz Lang's ""Fury"" (1936) and Melvyn LeRoy's ""They Won't Forget"" (1937) were earlier warnings about the power of mob violence. Later films with similar themes include ""The Lawless"" (1950) and ""The Sound of Fury"" (1950).

Bottom line - This is an excellent film in all respects.",1310860800,2,8463,4.687120701281187

Directed by William A. Wellman

Two drifters are passing through a Western town, when news comes in that a local farmer has been murdered and his cattle stolen. The townspeople, joined by the drifters, form a posse to catch the perpetrators. They find three men in possession of the cattle, and are determined to see justice done on the spot.

This was the last film during that period of time ever nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture which received no other Academy Award nominations.  A very unusual film for its time in that it features an Afro-American character as one of the main voices of conscience.

Special footnote: -- The role played by Henry Fonda was originally offered to Gary Cooper, who turned it down.  Henry Fonda was generally unhappy with the quality of the films he had to do while under contract with 20th Century Fox. This was one of only two films from that period that he was actually enthusiastic about starring in. The other was The Grapes of Wrath (1940).

359953,4,6301798201,"""The Ox Bow Incident"" opens perfectly as Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan ride over a ridge into a gloomy western town. While that the first scene is not exactly unique, it is strikingly well done here.

It soon develops that a popular rancher has been murdered. A lynch mob is quickly formed, albeit without any evidence pertaining to the deed, a dead body or witnesses to a shooting. In perfect hindsight, that should have been a red flag! The wise heads in town are shouted down. The sheriff is away. A deputy forms a posse, with no authority to do so. That should have been another red flag. Among the bad guys is an almost callow Dana Andrews, decidedly not like the hardboiled cop from ""Laura"" or ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"". In fact, most of the cast are sensitive and well-spoken. The ultimate complication emerges with the arrival of the sheriff with the news that the dead rancher is very much alive! The fadeout reverses the opening with Fonda and Morgan riding off into the gloaming.

The strong point of OBI is the gloomy mood that persists throughout. This is a very efficient movie with only 75 minutes running time. HF made only one more movie before entering the Navy for WW2.

Beautiful performances by Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn along with the reaction shots of the mob after the final realization of their lynching leave an indelible mark on the watcher.

359957,3,6301798201,"I have a hard time with Westerns, I really do. This one was mercifully short. I guess I wasn't in the mood for what it offered: I didn't like the THESE CHARACTERS ARE SYMPATHETIC and THESE CHARACTERS ARE UNSYMPATHETIC heavy-handedness, or how predictable the ending was, or how awkward it was to see Dana Andrews emoting, or how the movie decided to teach me a lesson. Maybe it's just not a lesson we need bludgeoned into our eyeballs in 2010, or am I being optimistic? Well, I didn't feel like being taught a lesson, at any rate. I felt like tangling my fingers in Dana's hair (or Anthony's eyelashes. Mmmm).
The good: Dana & Dana's hair, Anthony & Anthony's eyelashes... Also, Henry Fonda was better by the end than he promised at first. He started out being not very intriguing and ended being a hardass. I especially liked the quiet scenes between him and Harry Morgan, which came close to balancing out the bleak and overbearing scenes of, you know, lynching. There were a lot of surprisingly artsy shots and those were kind of fun to see.

I really enjoyed certain scenes here and there, but overall I think it did itself a disservice by being so social commentary-y (although at the time it must have been more progressive than it looks today) (I understand that it was based on a book but I don't feel like looking that up). Hmm. It just was not the type of movie I usually like to see, so I had to put up with some stuff to get through it. So take that into consideration if you would.

359958,5,6301798201,"As many have noted, the Ox-Bow incident is not your typical Western. It does not contain a lot of action, the scenery is pretty limited, and the cast is not that great, but it really will get you thinking about justice. Many other reviewers have described the plot, so I will not detail it here. Needless to say, the scenes that are most riveting are the ones where the men are trying to decide what to do with the supposed guilty men. The theme of this film is as relevant today, as it was when it was released. We so easily jump to our own conclusions that we sometimes get things wrong. In this case, the mistake is fatal.

If you are looking for a pretty short film, based on a classic novel, that will get you thinking, then Ox-Bow incident is a good choice. I enjoyed and think you might as well.",1261958400,,802,4.241830065359477
359959,5,6301798201,"'The Ox-Bow Incident' is truly a classic western that is so much more than just a ""shoot 'em up"" cowboy picture. Fonda is at the top of his game here and although not his finest performance, it certainly deserves merit. The film is rather short, but this doesn't effect its impact on you as we see just how horrible things can get when we try to speed up the justice system and take the law into our own hands. I enjoyed this film even though it is the type of film that leaves you angry. If you're a fan of the genre this is a must see film.",1257724800,2,542,4.027777777777778
359960,4,6301798201,"You know those films that just make you angry; the films that grab at some sense of inner justice and make you just squirm in frustration as you try and try and try to make sense of the abhorrent injustice taking place on the screen?  I think the first time I experienced that was when I saw `The Crucible'.  I remember getting all choked up in and clenching my fists in rage as I watched these horrible atrocities befall innocent people.  I remember similar feelings watching the more recent `House of Sand and Fog'.  When I related my feelings to my father after seeing `The Crucible' a few years back he told me of this movie and told me that it would send me into a rage.  Since then I've been planning on seeing this movie, I just never made the time.

I finally saw this last weekend and I must say; I was PISSED.

Adapted from the novel written by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, and based on a true story, William A. Wellman's 1943 film `The Ox-Bow Incident' is as tragic as they come, and is surely going to send shivers down your spine.  The film centers on a dusty Western town that is thrown into a frenzy when one of their friends and neighbors is reportedly murdered for his cattle.  Instead of waiting for the sheriff to return and justice to be handed out legally, a group of overzealous men (and one woman) form a lynching mob and set out to find to guilty party.  When they find three strangers who claim to have purchased the deceased cattle that morning they struggle with whether or not to believe the men.

The film tragically shows how power can corrupt and how imperfect justice is never `just'.  There are few in the party who feel a lynching is unfair, but the majority rules and thus results in an unspeakable tragedy.

I haven't seen too many films with Henry Fonda.  His later works I wasn't too fond of (I always use the term ""I'm none to fond of Fonda"" when I'm referring to his daughter Jane, but I can't say that for Henry), but the earlier work I've seen have been refreshing for me.  His powerful presence is seen here as well.  The way he reveals his characters emotional resolve is flawless, letting us see just enough of this man to comprehend just who he `really' is.  The acting as a whole is very good, especially from Dana Andrews, who just shatters my soul as the doomed Donald Martin (why was he not nominated for an Oscar?).

My only issue here is the films brisk nature.  The tale is so tragic and so poignant and yet the running time is only 75 minutes, not even an hour and a half.  Yes, there are some brilliant `short' films (just look at Charlie Chaplin's career) but to be honest, a film of the emotional weight NEEDS some length to build that depth.  The film almost feels incomplete upon its ending because they didn't take advantage of the story to really flesh out everyone involved.  There could have been a lot more character development going on here.  Instead they develop little more than the storyline.  It is still a great film, and the gut-punch is still there, but I can't help but think of what another thirty or forty minutes of pure character development would have done for the films overall impact.

I also was not a fan of the content of Martin's letter, for I felt that it was a cheep way at expressing a moral.  It didn't make any sense that Martin would have penned those words to his wife, no sense at all, but the director used his letter as a way to express to the audience how he wanted them to feel about the actions taken.  If he had slowed the film down and really got into the meat of the people involved then that letter would have been unnecessary.  In fact, in the novel the contents of that letter is never revealed, and personally I feel that that should have been left alone.

In any case, the film is a must see.  It is hailed as a classic and one of Fonda's best films.  I can say that he is very good in this, and the film itself is well worth watching.  Injustice can be very aggravating.  If only enough people would allow themselves to be transformed over by the mistakes of others.

I hate it when things like this happen.",1253059200,,4111,4.351706036745407

One rancher was found shot, his cattle missing. They form a posse to catch the murdering rustlers. ""Get your guns!"" Carter visits the Judge for Davies. The posse will be deputized to make them legal. They take along a preacher. Jenny joins the posse. Major Tetley arrives with news about the three rustlers. The men are deputized and leave in pursuit towards the old trail through the mountains. ""Nobody never knew for sure."" A stagecoach passes down the road. A shot hits one rider, but Art refuses to leave. The posse hears cattle in the distance. They ride into the camp to capture three men.

Major Tetley takes command. They question the prisoners. Don Martin's story is not believed. Will he get a fair trial? The posse decides to wait for sunrise. They all eat their fill. One man makes a break for freedom but is caught. He found a pistol on the road - it was Larry Kincaid's gun. Tetley asks for a vote, the majority are for hanging. And so the posse does what it wanted to do. They don't care about the claim of innocence. Returning, they meet the Sheriff who has shocking news! ""Alright, let's go."" Tetley's son gives his views on this event. There is a quiet and somber crowd in the saloon. Carter reads Martin's last letter to them. Justice is the conscience of humanity. Art and Carter leave to deliver the letter to Martin's widow.

This story is a change from those westerns (such as ""The Virginian"") that justified lynching. It is a warning against operating on unconfirmed rumors. This would be a better film if it was based on a true story and not fiction.",1241654400,,1731,4.544871794871795
360034,4,6301798201,"The Bottom Line:

The ""letter"" that Henry Fonda reads at the end of the film is almost audience-insulting in its lack of subtlety (they might as well have ended the movie with Fonda turning to the camera and lecturing on the importance of law and order) but for the majority of its running length The Ox-bow Incident is a dark and incisive look at ""justice"" in the old west",1241395200,,373,4.405797101449275
360035,5,6301798201,"I have seen this film five times now, the first two within twenty-four hours.  I found it that powerful, even upsetting, perhaps because it's so possible.  The story of the fulfillment of frontier justice could have been done as the usual western cliche, but William Wellman is probably not the usual sort of director of this genre.  This is the way real life often turns out -- it doesn't have the Hollywood soft-landing, deus-ex-machina plot resolution.  The film is relatively short, stark, black-and-white, with soundtrack limited to not much more than a single harmonica playing ""Red River Valley"" and background noise.  There are some interesting details -- note, particularly, as Fonda and Morgan ride into town, the dog crossing the street approaching the viewer, as if to say, ""I'm gonna show you something here"" and, as Fonda and Morgan exit the town at the end, re-crossing the street, away from the viewer, to say, ""Well, that's all there is to say.""",1239580800,,962,4.950310559006211
360036,4,6301798201,"This film was made in 1943 and stars the young Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan. Dana Andrews stars as does a very young Anthony Quinn. The performances here are very strong, especially from Fonda, Andrew and Quinn. Harry Morgan was the same in 1943 as he was in Mash in the `80's. I was particularly surprised by Dana Andrews; he was very effective as the rancher about to be hanged. I had always thought of him as a kind of lightweight but this film changed my mind.
It was easy to see the future stardom of these three actors from the film. The film itself is a western, but not your usual kind of western. This one is very dark and for the era, not very romanticized. These were real cowboys living the dangerous life of the frontier and some paid the price with their lives.
There was very little law and order and even less justice.
I can recommend this film strongly especially for the serious amateur of films around this time. I wasn't even born yet!",1224979200,,955,4.370786516853933
360037,5,6301798201,"The majority is not always right - as this classic western makes clear.  Peter Fonda does an excellent turn as one of only seven who stand in the minority against a mob determined to exact revenge - even if that means taking revenge on the wrong parties.

Great movie to remind us that might does not make right, and it is good to be in the minority when it comes to standing up for justice.",1220227200,,391,4.2
360038,5,6301798201,"Wonderfully directed by William Wellman in 1943, this is perhaps the darkest of all ""Films Noire.""  I cannot imagine another movie that would be more appropriately filmed in black and white.  It is one of the most heart-wrenching of all western movies, in that the viewers can clearly see the tragic direction the story inexorably moves in.

As others have synopsized, two drifters (Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan) are caught up in a scenario that mixes cattle rustling, murder, and the exacting of blind ""justice.""  Portraying drifter Gil Carter, Fonda's performance is typical of the masterful, low-key portrayals by the actor, such as in ""Twelve Angry Men,"" where he stands out as the lone voice for true justice.  Unfortunately, the ending is much different in ""The Oxbow Incident.""  The story in perhaps the thematic predecessor of Clint Eastwood's ""Hang ""em High,"" where an innocent man is hanged by a group of ""good citizens"" who actually epitomize mob mentality, except once again, the ending is quite different.

The is film blends all of the variables that together constitute virtually a perfect film, where it integrates those described above with the omni-present quest for power, the arrogance that almost always accompanies it, the ignorance that pervades mob mentality, and the over-riding theme that in life, things do not always turn out right.

While the story moves rather quickly, the most meaningful and powerful vignettes slow to a pace that emphasize their impacts.  Yes, there is a sense of justice at the climax, where the film's focus of power and arrogance, Major Tetley, is dealt with appropriately.  But ""the"" scene that is not to be missed is the moment where Fonda reads to the lynch mob the farewell letter written to his wife by Dana Andrews' character, Donald Martin.

Seriously, this is one of the most powerful films of its era, and still stands out as one of the best ever.  The film reiterates human qualities that cross all generations.",1216425600,,1974,5.003058103975535
360039,5,6301798201,"Have you ever thought you knew what the right thing to do was, but couldn't convince others of your reasoning?

 ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" could be best described as a western disguised as a morality play on mob justice, or vice versa. It definitely is a film which is based on not the traditional western format of ""shoot em up"" but rather takes a philosophical approach to what mob justice really entails, and what its consequences are.

Two men, Carter (Henry Fonda) and Croft (Harry Morgan), come into town and get themselves entangled with a group going out to find the murderer of a man in the local town. While the two feel reluctant to go out and be a part of this, they are urged on by another man, Davies, to go and make sure that the criminal or criminals will get a fair trial. Because the sheriff is not around, one deputy decides to ""deputize"" all the posse going out to find the killer, giving them the power to act as a majority. As the posse crosses a patch of area, they spot three men who they believe to be the killers. Rather than being judicial, one of the men, Tetley, becomes the ringleader of mob justice, wanting to hang the men on the spot. From here, the story becomes a dilemma in morals, where those who feel the men deserve a fair trial counter against those who feel that justice is ""slow and careless."" Carter emerges as one of the voices for the three men, who he feels deserve some form of fair justice.

As one reviewer alluded to, this is not a film that wastes words or time. Each scene of the film is concise and important to the eventual outcome of the story. Henry Fonda is a great leading character in the film, despite not getting as much of a role as one would assume. However, after the highest point of the film, and especially during the film's final fifteen minutes, Fonda's role really shines.

This is a unique look at the idea of mob justice played out on a Western scene. As far as the extras, what I really liked was the biography of Henry Fonda as Hollywood's Quiet Hero, detailing his many roles on screen and off screen. It really shows the talent of this actor, and the integrity he brought to his many roles in such films as The Grapes of Wrath (where he plays Tom Joad) and Twelve Angry Men (where he plays the man who has to convince eleven other jurors of a man's innocence).

Over all, this is a wonderful, profound film, with ""no fat"" extras.",1216080000,4,2401,4.37219730941704

360121,5,6301798201,"""THE OX-BOW INCIDENT"" is a film based on an excellent book by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, which I am currently reading in my English III class. The movie is one of the best Westerns ever made, if not one of the greatest movies ever made. It is the terrifying story of two drifters caught up in the hanging of three innocent men accused of cattle rustling and murder. These two drifters, Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) and Art Croft (Harry Morgan) do not always get along, but they do stand up for each other. And that is what the movie is really about- not the shootouts or the fighting, but the character relationships. They come into the sleepy town of Bridger's Wells not looking for trouble, but for the activities of what everybody does when they come into town: eat, drink, play cards, fight, talk, or sleep. However, while in this town, they do stumble across something unusual- a rumor of a murder and cattle rustling. Nobody that reports on what has supposedly happened has one shred of proof, but alot of the townsmen and ranchers from the area (including the character referred to as ""Ma"", played by Jane Darwell) suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere. They have not a thing to go on, but they are sure they have to do something. What follows is a lot of talk and speechifying, arguing and hard feelings. While this part of the story is a little slow in the book, the film keeps right on track. Eventually, they all set out to find the so-called murderers/rustlers, even though they do not have an idea of where they are going or what they are looking for. In the end, it all comes full circle for everyone involved, and the impending doom is undeniably haunting. However, the story is also very ironic in that they are finding justice for a murdered man and his stolen cattle, but they have assuredly done worse things in their own lives, not to mention that it is only in the end that they realize the horrors of what has occurred.

Chinese professor:  Oh, it is a fine movie.  The English is so clear!  There's no slang and coarse language like in the modern American films.

American:  And the plot?

Chinese professor:  Yes, the film is about lynching!  We read in our history books about lynching in the United States!  The film helps us understand how lynching oppressed the people.

American:  Professor, this film is as much about lynching as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is about banking.  The banking, the lynching -- they are just frames for the moral content of the films.

Chinese professor:  Oh ...

American:  It's about lawlessness, when people don't receive trials, but it's about a special kind of lawlessness.  Do you remember that as the posse rides off to find the rustlers, they all agree to ""follow the will of the majority""?

Chinese professor:  Yes ...

American:  The members of the posse decided that they represented the people when they decided to hang the men they apprehended.

American:  Remember, the book was written in 1940 and the movie showed in 1943.  All the fascist dictators said they represented their people's will.

Chinese professor:  The war ...

American:  And Stalin murdered and purged and sent people to death in the Gulag before, during, and after the War.  Later of course, there were the Red Guards during your own Cultural Revolution, who said they were implementing the people's will as they humiliated or betrayed or killed even their own teachers or their own relatives.

Chinese professor:  For the people's revolution ...

American:  So while the movie's set in the American West, it's about the Cultural Revolution in China too.  And isn't it interesting that a movie about the Cultural Revolution was made 20 years before it happened?  Which means that the movie addresses something universal, something that can happen in any place, at any time.

360125,5,6301798201,"There are a handful of movies every person needs to see in their life.  Not because their entertaining, but because they send a strong message that needs to be heard.  Henry Fonda, the great actor that he was, is in two of these movies, 12 Angry Men and The Ox-Bow Incident.  Both movies deal with something that we seem to lack these days: common sense, good judgment, and paying attention.  Of the two movies mentioned The Ox-Bow Incident is easily the best and most through provoking.

The movie centers Henry Fonda's character, Gil Carter, a rough and tumble cow hand who makes his way into town with his partner, Art (Harry Morgan) looking for a good time.  Gil Carter is an anti hero for a genre that was 20 years from embracing the anti hero, and we are given a list of reasons to love him and hate him.  Carter's unwillingness to confront situations head on gets frustrating towards the end of the film and you can see in Fonda's portrayal of the character that he knows he could of done something more in the end.  The story of a lynch mob heading out to hang the supposed responsible parties for a crime isn't the most original story but with this cast of characters and the present moral arguments makes this film original and thought provoking.

The central core of the movie is to make the viewer a silent member of the lynch mob, thirsty for justice.  From the initial formation of the mob, the film gives us reasons to support their actions and reasons to doubt them.  We are introduced to characters only by local knowledge and their current actions and words.  The characters do not stop to give their back story and what we learn from other characters is usually hearsay.  The strength of the film is that it makes you think about what your watching and listening too.  This film isn't high budgeted or filled with much action.  It is heavy in dialogue and atmosphere.

In researching this film, I came across, on more than one occasion, the quote (which I have to paraphrase) ""For evil men to triumph, all good men have to do is nothing"".  Really, this is the crux of this movie.  Carter is faced with strong doubt in this movie from the beginning and even sways with the mob at the beginning.  Yet, during the film and the waiting period for the hanging, Fonda's character begins to doubt the merits of the mob and in, the end, makes a final stand for the doomed men's lives, and after he fails, he tries to justify the acts in his own words, blaming the inexperience and naivety of the doomed men for their fates.

The performances in this film are outstanding for the most part and are really the reason to watch this film.  Harry Morgan, Anthony Quinn, Dana Andrews, and Jane Darwell all stand out in their roles in the film and really, all shine with their limited dialogue save for Harry Morgan who plays Caters partner, Art Croft.  The story does have one minor bump, and that involves the past of Gil Carter and his former love interest.  This brief scene could have been left out and the movie would not have suffered one real bit.  Perhaps there was something more to initially, but they never got a chance to hash it out.

In an age where we jump to judgment on many things in our lives, it is important to think things out before we pass judgment.  Movies like this show us the consequences of rash judgments and the mob mentality and  really, it would be good to see this movie right before the election season begins to get us into a critical thinking mode before deciding our elected officials employment fate.",1197331200,,3544,4.496875

This is a classic, black and white western about frontier justice gone awry. Based upon a true incident that was memorialized in Walter Van Tilburg Clark's best selling novel, this film was a Best Picture Academy Award nominee in 1943

This timeless and classic western, about how mob rule can carry the day, is set in Nevada around 1885. Cattle rustlers are the bane of the town's existence, when cowboys Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) and his illiterate side-kick, Art Croft (Henry Morgan), return to town. On the heels of their return, word gets around that a popular rancher, Larry Kincaid, has been murdered, shot in the head, and his cattle stolen.

The townspeople, mostly men, decide to have the sole deputy left behind by the sheriff deputize a posse ratherher than wait for the return of the sheriff from the Kincaid ranch.

This is a superb film, deftly directed by William A Wellman, who exacts marvelous performances from the entire ensemble. He is especially good when the subject is strong men mano-a-mano  The film deservedly earned its 1943 Academy Award nomination for best picture.

The transfer to DVD is great, as the print has apparently been re-mastered, providing the viewer with clear, crisp visuals and excellent audio. The DVD also provides some extras, such as a commentary by western scholar Dick Eulain and William Wellman, Jr., the director's son, an excellent A & E Network ""Biography"" episode, ""Henry Fonda: Hollywood's Quiet Hero"", as well as a stills gallery. This is a well-priced DVD of a great film, which should find its place in the personal collection of all those who love such films.

Highly recommended for fans of classic westerns and Henry Fonda.

360214,5,6301798201,"This brilliant film masterfully illustrates the horrors of anarchy as mob rule overtunes objective law in one small wild west town, even making interesting psychological observations about tyrannical power-lusters through the character of the colonel.  Henry Fonda stars as the voice of reason, but be forewarned: this one doesn't have a happy ending, as tragedy is necessary to dramatize the theme.

The only flaw is the go-nowhere sub-plot involving Fonda's love interest, but that takes so little time that it's a minor flaw and can be overlooked.

12 Angry Men, also starring Fonda, makes a good companion piece, as it shows the importance to liberty of objective law from a positive perspective.  It's amazing how much drama and tension they manage to put into a film that's essentially just twelve men sitting in a small room talking for an hour and a half (and this one doesn't make the mistake of trying to put in an irrelevent romance).

The special features on the Ox-Bow Incident DVD are also good (especially for an older film such as this), particularly the original trailer, which features Fonda talking about what the film means to him.  If only more trailers today were like this one.

360216,4,6301798201,"The list of movies addressing the issue of lynching as its major theme is small but impressive. Fritz Lang's great "" Fury "" leaps to mind as does the Mervyn LeRoy drama "" They Wont Forget"" but for my money it is this calssic that bears away the crown in this field .Its powerful portrait of mob violence rises to the level of Greek tragedy in its air of inevitability and catharsis, and in its brilliant examination of the psyche of its principal characters

The movie is based on events which took place in  Nevada in 1885 . Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan play two drifting cowboys who ride into the town of Bridger's Wells and promptly head for the saloon .They hear of a popular local rancher being shot by rustlers ;a posse is set up lead by the blustering and pompous ex-Confederate army officer "" Tetley ""( Frank Conroy)who dons his old uniform for the venture .and insists that his sensitive son (William Eythe) goes along ,because it will "" make a man of him "".Fonda and Morgan reluctantly accompany the mob .The main reason they do so is to avoid being accused of the crime thenselves .

The mob come upon 3 men -horse traders -by their capmpfire .These men -Dana Andrews , Anthony Quinn and Francis Tesa) -are accused of the crime even though no evidence exists of their guilt .They are strung up on the spot ,Andrews pleading to be allowed to write a last letter to his wife ,a request that is granted .

The posse return in high good humour only to be shown as not vigilantes but murderers .The finale when Fonda reads Andrews' letter aloud is sentimental but moving .

I have called this an anti-Western and I stand by that description for the movie is critical of what most Westerns deem a virtue -the pioneer spirit .These are men and women embittered and crippled emotionally who resort to mob rule to cover up their own cowardice and personal inadequacies .This is most obvious in the figure of the homesteader played by Jane Darwell .This type of character is usually shown in a positive light by the conventional Western-hard working ,salt of thre earth types .Here the woman is shrewish and shrill ,an empty sounding brass of a woman utterly devoid of compassion or moral feeling .Then there is the bartender (Paul Hurst) who accompanies the posse-a slimy rabble rouser and the embittered vengeance seeking man played by Marc Lawrence .All claim lyching is part of the "" Code of the West"" and cannot see that it is its  very opposite

The Colonel is a fraud and a bully ,his son an emotional weakling

It is also an anti-Western in its turning away from the wide open spaces of popular genre myth-the movie was largely shot on the studio lot with some obvious painted backcloths .These help the movie rather than hinder it ,giving a sense of claustrophobia which adds to the power .It is West where meanness and suspicion have replaced optimism and heroics .

The movie has been criticised as solemn and dull ,James Agee saying it suffered from ""rigor artis"" and was too static. I disgree but otheres will echo Agee's sentiments ,especially if they insisit on lots of action in the genre

Brilliantly acted all round with Quinnn scoring heavily in a small role as a man with a criminal past but being killed forsomething he did not do .Subtle direction from William Wellman and outstanding photography from Arthur Miller .This movie even looks authentic with the clothes appearing well worn and dusty

360217,5,6301798201,"The Ox-Bow Incident displays a very real situation with ordinary people making rash decisions based on feelings, prejudice, and group dynamics.  The story takes place in Nevada where the inhabitants of a small village take the law into their own hands in the year of 1885.  There were thousands of small towns such as this one spread out throughout the west of the Mississippi.  Each town had their own elected sheriff that upheld the law, and often with a bias toward the townsfolk.  Strangers did not often come through small towns and these strangers often experienced some level of xenophobia, which is even noticeable in the beginning of Ox-Bow Incident when one of the strangers points out that they have to be careful as they are strangers.

Xenophobia plays a big part of the film, which often stemmed from hearsay and stories told by friends in small towns throughout the west.  Some of these stories can be read in old newspapers that exaggerated tales in order to increase sales.  This has also been exploited in many Westerns.  Then you have those who lived by the status of protecting themselves against others, and in that perspective strangers were commonly seen as threats.  Despite the prevalence of xenophobia many of the towns such as the one in Ox-bow Incident, they would have insisted that their town were the nicest and most pleasant of them all.  If this was the case, then why would there be stories of lynching and vigilantism in the decades after the Western expansion, stories such as the Ox-Bow Incident.

The film opens with two strangers riding into the quiet small town of the story's focus, as they tie their horses outside the town's saloon.  One of the strangers gives a friendly gesture to one of the townsfolk, probably to ease possible tension within the town.  These two men, Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) and his friend, are visiting Gil's girlfriend, Rose Mapen, but it happens that she has left most likely due to the married women who saw her as a threat.  Upset Gil ends up in a fight with a cowboy, Jeff Farnley (Marc Lawrence), who suggests that he has stolen some cattle since he is a stranger after all.  Instead of getting in trouble, Gil teaches the man a lesson by beating him up and making him look foolish.  Shortly after, a young boy rushes into the saloon and yells that Kinkaid has been killed and his cattle are missing.

The emotions are flowing and a vice-Sheriff improperly deputies the townsfolk who set out to find the killer.  Gil and his friend have no choice than to go with, or they might be perceived as the guilty party, which might be enough for a rowdy mob.  It turns into a journey of legal madness where lawlessness prevails in the hands of those in emotional turmoil while xenophobia reaches its pinnacle.  But instead of displaying an ordinary tale of vengeance, the Ox-Bow Incident depicts a moral story of justice and humanity in darkness.  The culminating ending delivers a potent lesson when the posse returns to the saloon where it all once began.  The director William A. Wellman truly created a brilliant cinematic experience through this Western tale, which opposes the greatness of the Western and instead displays the wickedness of lawlessness.",1119830400,3,3223,4.7902350813743215
360218,4,6301798201,"Sometimes Amazon's ""Editorial Reviews"" absolutely burn me up.  Do these people even watch these films?  The ""one cowboy who tried to turn the mob aside"" apparently refers to Fonda's character, who actually observes and doesn't get very involved, speaking aside to his friend and therefore serving as our narrator; there are actually other characters more directly involved with the events pictured here who try to stop the lynching, and in any event, NONE of these ""ultimately prove"" the innocence of the accused.  Finally, Fonda made this film years after ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" with ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" coming just before he entered the service in WWII; ""My Darling Clementine"" was his first release after the war.  Sheesh.

But what you really want to know, those of you who haven't yet seen this film, is whether this classic holds up to its reputation and is fit for viewing today.  The answers are yes and yes, absolutely.  It's a simple little story but well told, based on true events that portray a miscarriage of justice in the American West.  The story could just as easily have taken place in any time or place where people are tried in the court of public opinion and then take matters into their own hands.  It happens in the cities of the world today, after all.

An America at war wasn't interested in seeing this downbeat film at that time, and I doubt if 20th Century Fox has yet retrieved its investment for having given the project the go-ahead.  It eventually earned its reputation as public moods shifted, and is well worth a viewing.  A cautionary tale for those (the majority?) of us who tend to shoot our mouths off regarding the actions of others when we know little about them.  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, and there were plenty of fools at the Ox Bow...but not enough angels.",1116201600,8,1819,4.718354430379747
360219,5,6301798201,"Made in 1943, this short 75-minute Western is a rock solid piece of filmmaking that is remarkably fresh today, thanks to the very intelligent, sparse dialogue and the powerful theme. Killing based on mob justice--without benefit of jury trial--has been a staple, unfortunately, of American history, as recently as the 20th century (see the excellent HBO film Vendetta for an example of this), and The Ox-Bow Incident, based on a real 19th century incident, is another.

Henry Fonda is brilliant as the understated male lead whose sense of decency is belied by his gruff cynical exterior. The cynicism he expresses is so pungent, without at all being overblown, that this in itself just about makes the film worth seeing. Henry Morgan as his partner adds the right amount and degree of companionship presence, and the other actors do a fine job as well with the sharp dialogue that wastes no words.

When three men are falsely accused of rustling cattle and, in particular, killing the man from whom the cattle was stolen, the posse who so accuses them wastes no time in going after them. One of the three, a Mexican played by Anthony Quinn, is much smarter than the initially lets on.  Interestingly enough, Quinn, despite his name, was in fact born in Mexico so his character is a real life correlate with his own cultural heritage.

Knowing that ""ethnic cleansing"" and terrorism are very much a part of our modern world, The Ox-Bow Incident's denouement speech by Fonda's character--reading a letter written by one of the three accused men--is a powerful indictment of one of the basest traits of human nature. This is a grim, powerful film with no ounce of fat on it and that will last for decades to come.

Very highly recommended.",1115510400,9,1735,4.828282828282828
360220,5,6301798201,"This film is a gritty portrayal of the old west in the 1880's with a town obviously hard on its luck. This film reminds me a lot of another of Fonda's later work, ""12 Angry Men"". But instead of a jury, its a mob formed as a posse with vengence on their mind. Some of the characters want to legitimately settle a score with the men or man that killed their friend, others are in for the sheer excitment and entertainment of  a hanging. In the mix are new comers Fonda and Morgan who go along partly to ensure that they themselves are not suspects but also go out of some curiousity and sense of fair play. The personalities range from the affluent, powerful and suspicious Tettleton who seems to glory in leading the posse in his Confederate Officer uniform that is rumored to have never seen battle with a myriad number of other unique personalities. The rest are curious parrallels, the right but weak son of Tettleton, the machismo Deputy who lacks cerebal depth, the town drunk who is an insuuferable vigalantee, the store owner who seeks justice and  a poor man who comes along as a minister thinking of the potential victims who appear to have no legal alternatives. The posse contains over 30 men with a single woman called ""Ma"" who is harder than most of the men in the possee. The accused are three contrasts, one old and weak, one strong and good and the other, played by Anthony Quinn who may be a criminal in his past but he is not this day as he travels with what may be innocent men. As the possee captures the three men, a carnival like atmosphere begins for the majority of the possee while a few try to change their mind with Fonda playing an unsophisticated but earnest cowhand that trys to stop the hanging. The final scenes reminds me of a Jesus like portyal as the three men, particularly the obviously wholesome good man who finally, after much disbelief, accepts his fate as some sort of invalid sacrifice. The final scenes are very unusual for a western in that its very adult and surprising with the ramifications of the actions of the whole thrust upon them at the end. A wonderful exchange back in town ocurrs when the vindictive drunk vigalant proclaims that its ""all Tettleton's fault and we ought to hang him."" ""Haven't you had enough hangings for one day"", replies Fonda. Its as if to say that regardless of the consequences of their actions, the evil in some men's souls can never be changed for the good.",1108771200,4,2436,4.509049773755656
360321,4,6301798201,"This movie, filmed back during the days of WWII, is still as emotionally compelling as it was then.  Based on the adaptation of Walter Van Tilburg Clark's book of the same title, this story is about some cowboys eager for some justice after news has reached them of a fellow local's murder.  These thirty odd men and one woman went off searching for justice and end up learning an important lesson.

Henry Fonda, one of the lead characters, plays the reluctant and rambunctious stranger.  His character goes along with the ""mob"" more then anything, but he is truly in the center of the ethical debate that lingers around the lives of the three men who may be the murderers.

As I said, this story is still strong today.  The only baggage this film brings along with age is black and white (if you don't like it), but mainly a few archaic non-politically correct comments.  This shouldn't distract you as it is merely something to note as a sign of the times.  Mainly, just enjoy this film, for the classic it is.",1104796800,,1012,4.552486187845304
360322,5,6301798201,"This is a classic, black and white western about frontier justice gone awry. Based upon a true incident that was memorialized in Walter Van Tilburg Clark's best selling novel, this film was a Best Picture Academy Award nominee in 1943, losing to ""Casablanca"".

This timeless and classic western, about how mob rule can carry the day, is set in Nevada around  1885.  Cattle rustlers are the bane of the town's existence, when cowboys Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) and his illiterate side-kick, Art Croft (Henry Morgan), return to town. On the heels of their return, word gets around that a popular rancher, Larry Kincaid, has been murdered, shot in the head, and his cattle stolen.

The townspeople, mostly men, decide to deputize a posse on their own and take justice into their own hands, rather than wait for the return of the sheriff from the Kincaid ranch. The one woman, ""Ma"" Grier (Jane Darwell), is a harridan as bloodthirsty as the men.  The mob disregards the sane, rational advice of the town's judge and of those townspeople who have cooler heads. Instead, those with blood lust in their veins prevail, and the so-called posse rides out in pursuit of frontier justice. Gil and Art join them, despite being of a mind that it would be best to wait for the sheriff.

The posse happens to come across three sleeping travelers with a herd of cattle.  A dapper Mexican (Anthony Quinn), a young husband and father (Dana Andrews), and a piteous, slow-witted, old man constitute the hapless trio. With blood lust rampant, the mob obtains some seemingly damning information from them and quickly forms an opinion as to their guilt. Even though seven men, Gil Carter and Art Croft among them, disagree with the decision, the merciless majority prevails, and rough frontier justice is meted out without benefit of formal trial or due process.

This film is similar in some ways to the 1957 film,  ""12 Angry Men"", also starring Henry Fonda. There, despite a seemingly open and shut case,  twelve men are prevailed upon to weight the facts very carefully and to examine the evidence in an objective rational fashion to ensure that justice be done. In ""The Ox-Bow Incident"", one sees what can happen when one seemingly has an open and shut case but fails to examine the evidence in an objective and dispassionate manner. In one case, justice is done. In the other, a travesty of justice occurs.

This is a superb film, deftly directed by William A Wellman,  who exacts marvelous performances from the entire ensemble. Despite its brevity, being only approximately seventy-five minutes in length,  the film manages to pack a dramatic wallop. Moreover, the sets are realistic looking, with a dirty, dusty, and gritty feel, as are the seemingly threadbare, dirty,  and ratty clothing  worn by some of the actors. The film deservedly earned its 1943 Academy Award nomination for best picture.

The transfer to DVD is great, as the print has apparently been re-mastered, providing the viewer with clear, crisp visuals and excellent audio. The DVD also provides some extras, such as a commentary by western scholar Dick Eulain and William Wellman, Jr., the director's son,  an excellent A & E Network ""Biography"" episode, ""Henry Fonda: Hollywood's Quiet Hero"", as well as a stills gallery.

360329,5,6301798201,"Before ""12 Angry Men"" there was ""The Ox-Bow Incident,"" a bleaker and never less than fascinating exploration of the nature of mob violence.  Unlike ""12 Angry Men,"" this film has no clear-cut heroes.  It takes place in a more primitive, wilder time and location, and the principal question at the crux of this movie's conflict is whether or not three suspected cattle thiefs should be punished without due legal process.  A small group is in favor of letting the frontier town sheriff handle the situation, while a much larger group smells only blood (and in some cases are motivated by personal vengeance) and convince themselves of the suspects' guilt without listening to any of the evidence.  It's quite a frightening movie in its own way, and it has a stark look at odds with the average studio film being churned out at the time (1943).
Henry Fonda is quite good, as usual, in the closest thing the movie has to a main character, but it seems pointless to single him out in what is obviously such an ensemble effort, and in a movie that only lasts a mere 75 minutes or so and has such a large cast, each actor manages to color his/her character with delightful details, sometimes with no more than a single line of dialogue or one reaction shot.
""The Ox-Bow Incident"" is a fantastic film.  I don't think it's well-remembered now, but I'm thrilled to see it on DVD and hope that it will be rediscovered.

In times of national hysteria, movies such as this are a not so subtle reminder of what we, as a species at large, are sometimes capable of doing.

However, ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" is probably one of the finest films you are likely to ever see. Director, William Wellman, fills the screen with sweeping social commentary and imbues his lead character, played by Henry Fonda, with the righteous every-man perspective that would become Fonda's hallmark and a main staple in American cinema in the decade's that followed.
TRANSFER: FANTASTIC!  After the rather shoddy work done on their studio line's Mark of Zorro and The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, I wasn't holding out much hope for their subsequent B&W releases.

360352,4,6301798201,"At times the sets look like the results of a high-school art class, while the preachy last scene is about as necessary as sugar on steak, yet this film remains arguably Hollywood's most powerful anti-lynching statement. It's a real oddity, an expressionist challenge amidst the confines of the traditional Western. But then time and place are clearly secondary to the movie's main point, its topical message. In 1943 Jim Crow was too strong to attack directly, at the same time the South remained a bastion of box-office movie-goers. So the screen adaptation keeps to the safer setting of 1880's Nevada, even as the  the Confederate major and the Negro preacher embody the allegorical social message. What makes the film work, however, are  uniformly fine performances from a nucleus of unheralded players: Frank Conroy as the imperious major, William Eythe as the weakling son, Paul Hurst, Leigh Whipper, and in perhaps the best performance of a so-so career, young Dana Andrews as the most sympathetic victim. It's his touching mixture of desperation with stricken disbelief that grips the audience and reveals the depth of the tragedy. There's an emotional honesty here that endures. Stand out too, are the posse scenes leading up to the lynchings. Their raucous byplay and casual cruelty underscore a mentality more concerned with a boy's night out than with the demands of real justice. Then too, who can forget the piercing guffaw of Jane Darwell's bawdy old harridan that mocks the proceedings and demeans the suffering. The cross currents here between lust for blood and plain old lust for power have seldom been more subtly or searchingly drawn.  All in all, it's an ugly depiction, one not easily papered over by a remorseful wrap-up. Henry Fonda's role goes little beyond an interested onlooker, and it's to his credit that an established star would accept such a secondary part. If only the studio had trusted  audience reaction, ditched the letter gimmick, and allowed the events to speak for themselves, this could have been a classic, instead of the erratically wrought commentary it finally is.",1065744000,6,2110,5.089595375722543

I'm not going to recapitulate the plot, others have done that; suffice it to say I've read and loved the book, and the movie faithfully captures the mood and the morality of the book.
I first saw this film years ago, and I'm glad it is now available on tape and DVD.  Buy it, you'll not regret it.

360354,5,6301798201,"I had read ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" some time before I had the opportunity to see the movie.  I'm not sure what channel I caught it on but I was smart enough to tape it.  Unfortunately, I was foolish enough to have a Beta VCR at the time.  This is a timeless movie with a superb script that was well-adapted from Walter Van Tilberg Clark's western novel.  The acting is terrific with Henry Fonda putting in an outstanding performance along with an excellent cast overall.  The movie probably isn't even 90 minutes in length but in the time we have we are witness to an exceptional story.  The plot is simple: In the late 1800's, news of the murder of a popular rancher reaches the local western town.  In shock and anger, a posse is formed and the chase is on.  They find the three men they seek, hold an on-the-spot trial and deliver justice in the frontier form of capital punishment.  The bulk of the movie focusses on the ""trial"" of the three men who protest that they are innocent and unaware of the crime.  We see how anger and hatred can close otherwise open minds.  We see how people can be intimidated to not speak up against an authoritative majority.  It reminds one of the quote of Edmund Burke that the only thing necessary for the success of evil ""is that good men do nothing"".
This movie is a spellbinding drama that came out in the midst of WWII.  One can often enjoy many of the ""propaganda"" slants of the movies of that era.  However, this is a very sobering message that suggests that the evils we were then fighting could become our own if we weren't careful.  Perhaps the director chose this movie as a way of making a statement about the Japanese internments of the time.  If so, it was an excellent yet subtle message.  It is a timeless reminder to all of us.",1049760000,3,1779,4.391437308868501
360355,5,6301798201,"I first saw this movie in 1943 in Nebraska.  In those days, some theatres would show ""previews,"" or complete movies that had not yet been released in the area.  Typically, these were shown following the last feature on Saturday night, which meant that it was close to midnight before the preview began which, in turn, meant that usually there were few people in the theatre.  The Ox-Bow Incident is one of the most unrelievedly gloomy, brooding, threatening movies ever made.  Try to imagine seeing this film for the first time, well after midnight in a small Nebraska town in an almost empty theatre, with the distinct feeling that what appeared on the screen could just as well be happening right outside the theatre.  With the possible exception of The Third Man (also first seen as a preview), no movie has had as lasting an impact on me.  The premise was not especially novel - a small town mob of hard cases, sluggards, and just plain cow pokes and townspeople set out to catch some cattle rustlers who killed a respected, at least in death, member of the community and avenge his murder.  They rather quickly come upon the rancher's herd being driven by Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn, and an older hand who seems not to be of sound mind.  Andrews pleads their innocence with tears and begging that is almost painful to watch; Quinn spits defiance and scorn for his captors; and the senior citizen seems puzzled about what is happening.  Henry Fonda and Henry (later Harry Morgan of ""Mash"" fame) Morgan, are two cow punchers who unfortunately drift into town along with word of the rustling and killing. They initially appear destined to be the forces of reason who will keep the mob under control.  Arthur Davies, as a storekeeper who strongly believes in his religion and the constitution of his country, fervently pleads with what quickly has turned into a mob to do the Christian thing and to follow the strictures of the law.  But it is evident that he has played a similar role too often with most of the members of the mob and has lost whatever effectiveness he might have had.  To a degree, Fonda and Morgan try to back him, but as strangers themselves, they are not immune to suspicion so must tread warily.  What would be a subplot if it bore less on the outcome of the film involves an attempt of a retired army officer to force his nearly grown son to ""act like a man.""  His attempts have disastrous effects on the whole venture.  The movie is faithful to the Walter Van Tilburg Clark book that is little more than a short story.  The issue of how quickly a group of citizens can turn into an unthinking mob which is pivotal to this film was hardly new at the time.  What makes the film strike you in the solar plexus like a horse's kick is the marvelous somber, dark, ominous atmosphere of the surroundings, from the interior of the bar to the outside, coupled with the powerful acting of the cast from  top to bottom.  There is not a weak link in the cast.  Fonda is world-weary but still possessed of a sense of decency.  He endeavors, perhaps with less than unbridled enthusiasm, to keep the mob from its intended action, but seems to convey that he knows he will not succeed.  Morgan, is excellent in the sidekick role.  Davies, Quinn, Andrews,and the rest all are excellent.  On my list of best films, this one surely is in the top 10.  It is a crying shame that it is not better known and more widely honored.  Like some other reviewers, I wonder when a DVD will be made; one is long overdue.",1045353600,7,3515,4.530903328050713
360356,5,6301798201,"A cowboy is unable to prevent three wandering travellers from being unjustly lynched for murder. One of the great Westerns to date, THE OX-BOW INCIDENT - based on an actual event occuring in 1885 Nevada - is a powerful and ugly portrait of mob violence that equals majestic Greek tragedy.  This is a Wellman masterpiece, shown through a glass darkly or not, one where he uncannily penetrates the psyche of his characters with brilliant exposure.  The whole film is coated with shadow (for doubt and fear) and it has a gritty, worn-out feel to its atmosphere right down to the threadbare costumes on the actors, in keeping with the somber tale.  Much of this is due to Arthur Miller's outstanding cinematography which is ably supported by a suitably downbeat musical score by Cyril J. Mockridge. Fonda, Andrews and Quinn are superb in their roles, and the movie was directed awesomely by William Wellman: he drew suitably subtle performances from some & properly bombastic renderings from others - i.e. Quinn as Juan Martines, etc. The film was purposely given a sort of ""claustrophobic look"" - via its being set-bound with painted backdrops - in order to create a mood of pervasive doom and maniacal intent of the two dozen ""average citizens"" to commit a capital crime.  Fonda was justly proud of his bravura work in this rather controversial and somewhat depressing Western. As a curious trivial footnote, the film was originally to have showcased Mae West - of all people - as a sort of wisecracking saloon hostess around whom the story would have revolved (!)",1045094400,3,1562,4.8830188679245285
360357,5,6301798201,"""The Ox-Bow Incident,"" while a western by genre, is a profound analysis of the social phenomena of lynch mobs. This transcends the classic lynchings through hanging, but the manner by which groups of people presume guilt as condemn the suspect without a fair hearing.

Henry Fonda's character is one man who believes in capital punishment, but also believes in the right to a fair trial. However, he faces down a large posse of bloodlusting men who are not interested in examining the difficult truth, but instead who prefer the convenient satiation of their rage. How does one voice among many speak, especially if they don't want to hear? There is a depth to it, similar to ""Twelve Angry Men,"" also starring Fonda.

Anthony Quinn is one of two men facing a tree-hung noose. MASH's Henry Morgan is very young and dapper here (without his horse, Sophie), and stars as Fonda's friend.

A subplot regards a military leader who essentially leads the posse to the men, and his relationship with his son whom he forces to come along. The son, a prim and delicate sophisticate is opposed to his machismo-laden father in both personality and mission. Their conflict between right and wrong, son against father, man against child is more than a subplot, but a natural part of any such confrontation.

A short film of 75 minutes apparently not yet on DVD, it is acclaimed as a classic. However, it is far from showing the powerful vistas of ""Red River"" or the gruff but witty one-liners of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" It moves quickly, and its tight editing avoids cliches and limits the viewer from feeling as if he can expect the next line.

I fully recommend ""The Ox-Bow Incident."" It is the sort of movie worth watching in a high school civics course, or in a movie discussion group.

360358,5,6301798201,"Last night I recommended this movie to a friend who mentioned she is not really into western as a film genre.  I told her I generally felt the same way, but after watching a few westerns (Unforgiven, Butch Cassidy AND this film), my view of westerns as run-of-the-mill shot 'em ups changed.  This movie is far from standard, it is a study of humanity and our individuality, or lack thereof.  The stagey, theatrical element adds to the beautiful simplicity of the story being told.

360359,4,6301798201,"I really would have liked to like this movie more than I did. Not that I didn't enjoy it--I thought it had a very good screenplay and three especially good performances from Fonda, Andrews, and Quinn. I thought, after seeing ""Laura"" and ""The Best Years of Out Lives,"" that the casting of suave Dana Andrews in a western was ludicrous, but here he gives a very heartfelt and authentic performance. The only real problem I found in this film was that it's home seems to be suited more to the stage than the screen. Most all the action takes place in one setting, which can be very effective for building suspense, but here the camera and editing seem to toned down to do so. The only moment for me that was pure cinema was after the three innocent men were hanged and a black preacher sang ""Lonesome Valley"" as we watched the merciless mob leave the scene. The discovery of the men's innocence lacked the power it needed. But, overall, this was a very thought-provoking film, and should be regarded as such.",1024876800,,1005,4.527472527472527

7815177,5,6301798201,"""Ox-bow"" is a powerful film, one of the best westerns, and one of the best films ever made. I saw it for the first time several years ago, and watched it a second time today, and I was moved. It is a very thoughtful film, well-acted by very good actors, with a profound message that people simply do not learn. It is a classic story of mass-hysteria, of the masses accepting the view or views of a minority, without thinking, if the minority is loud enough and persistent enough, even when the minority are criminals.
In the film, a small group of rustlers, we do not know how many, it could have been a single individual, is reported to have stolen cattle from a man and killed him. A vociferous couple of men gather a huge posse of 28 men, including one woman, to rush out and find the alleged criminal or criminals and to hang him or them without a trial. They refuse to listen to the town judge who cautions them to wait until the return of the sheriff and, in any event, not to hang or otherwise mistreat an alleged criminal without a trial. The situation is aggravated by the self-appointed leader of the posse having a personal problem. Only seven of the 28 posse members say they do not want the three men who the posse captured hung.",1519776000,,1242,4.357758620689655
