1807889,4,B00007ELMV,"WWE No Mercy 2002 was no doubt one of the best PPV's of the year.  Headlined by arguably the most brutal and intense Hell In A Cell match in history, WWE Champion-Brock Lesnar once again faces the challenge of the Undertaker.  To say that this match is not for the weak of heart would be an incredible understatement.  In a title unification match, World Heavyweight Champion-Triple H fights off the Intercontinental Champion-Kane.  New WWE Tag Team Titles are introduced for Smackdown in a tournament final match that was no doubt tag match of the year.  Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit take on Edge and Rey Mysterio in a non-stop classic.  Jamie Noble defends the WWE Cruiserweight strap against Tajiri.  Chris Jericho and Christian defend their World Tag Team Titles against Booker T and Goldust.  Women's Champion-Trish Stratus is challenged by Victoria.  Rob Van Dam tries to get revenge when he goes one on one with Ric Flair.  Torrie Wilson takes on Dawn Marie.  WWE No Mercy is filled with many memorable events that are still being talked about today.  It is no doubt worth having in your collection.",1038787200,,1105,4.819148936170213
1807890,4,B00007ELMV,"WWE No Mercy was a very cool pay-per-view event which took place in Little Rock, AR. A friend of mine recorded it off PPV and let me borrow it. I watched it, and it was pretty cool. But the only match you'll probably care about seeing is the Hell In a Cell match between Brock Lesnar & The Undertaker. Anybody that says wrestling is 'all fake', I dare that person to eat supper while watching Hell In a Cell. The Undertaker & Brock Lesnar beat the...out of each other. At one point, Lesnar throws a set of steel steps at Undertaker, and next thing you know, he's got blood literally pouring from a nasty gash on his forehead. Blood spatters all over ringside, all over the wrestling ring, & I mean EVERYWHERE!This match is ECW quality! No barbed wire or thumbtacks, and no fighting ontop of the cell, but still very gruesome and disturbing at times. Gorehounds will surely love this one! Be sure & order this video right now here on Amazon.com  You'll get your money's worth, even if you get it just for the Cell match.
P.S. The Hell In a Cell match is quite graphic and may never see the light of day on cable TV. TOO BLOODY!...

World Tag Team Championship Match: Chris Jericho & Christian (C)vs. Booker T & Goldust: A good tag team match with a lot of action. Winner: Chris Jericho & Christian 3/5

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie: A match based on Dawn Marie's love for Al Wilson. Not a very good match, but what would you expect. Winner: Torrie Wilson 1/5

Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair: This Match was good and it really doesn't dissapoint. RVD fans will enjoy it. Winner: Rob Van Dam 3/5

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match: Jamie Noble (C) w/ Nidia vs. Tajiri: An ok cruiserweight match with Noble winning. Winner: Jamie Noble 2/5

WWE World Heavyweight and WWE Intercontinental Championship Unification Match: Triple H (WHC) vs. Kane (IC): This match was pretty good but the story line of Katie Vick is just rediculous and stupid and makes wrestling look even more fake and simple. Overall, a good match with Triple H going into his bag of tricks to get the win. 3/5

Finals of the Smackdown Tag Team Championship Tournament: Rey Mysterio & Edge vs. Kurt Angle & Chris Beniot: This match and the main event stole the show, but this one had it all. Great action and wrestling skills and finished 3rd for match of the year. No one gives up in this one. Winner: Angle & Beniot 5/5

Hell in a Cell for the WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar (C) vs. Undertaker: This Hell in a Cell match is one of the best with tons of blood, action, and powerful moves.

1807893,5,B00007ELMV,"Match 1: World Tag Team Championship

Chris Jercho and Christian (champs)vs. Booker T and Goldust

This was good opener for the payper view. It had some of the normal tag team qualities, with some differences. There were some cool moves made, but in the end Jericho pinned Goldust by hitting him with a bulldog on the title, then doing a moonsault on the turnbuckle.

Winners: Chris Jericho and Christian

Rating: 6.5/10

Match 2

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie

Usually I don't care for diva matches because nothing interesting ever happens, but this was preety good ( and the fact that both of the divas in this match look extremely hot)

In the end Torrie gets the pin.

Winner: Torrie Wilson

Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair

This was pretty good match. The side of dominance changed between the two through out the match. At the end, Rob Van Dam hits the Five Star Frog Splash and gets the pin.

Winner: Rob Van Dam

Match 4 Cruiserweight Championship

Jamie Noble (champ) with Nidia vs. Tajiri

This was good cruiserweight match. There were alot cool moves made by both of these two superstars. Jamie Noble wins with the help of Nidia, the aftermath was funny though.

Winner: Jamie Noble

Ratting: 6/10

Match 5 World Heavyweight Championship/Intercontinental Championship: Winner Take All

Triple H (World Heavyweight Champion) vs. Kane (Intercontinental Champion)

I usually do not like Triple H's matches becuase he usually dominates to much, but this was actually good. These to beat the living crap out of each other, the dominance of the match changed between the two. There was interference from Ric Flair and The Hurricane. Kane hit about three cool chokeslams, one of them conisist of slamming Triple H throgh the Spanish annouce table. At the end of match, Triple H rammed Kane into the turnbuckle, then hit the Pedigree.

Winner: Triple H

Rating: 8.5/10

Match 6 First Ever WWE Tag Team Championship

Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit vs. Rey Mysterio and Edge

This is one of the best tag team match I have ever seen. This had everything a tag team match needed. My favorite part was all four men hit the trademark finching moves and all of them were out. At the end of the match, Rey Mysterio and Chris Benoit are both outside the ring, and it is just Kurt and Edge. Kurt counters the Edgecution and turns it into the Anckle Lock, but Edge counter it into his own Anckle Lock. After that Kurt counter it and put it back into his own anckle lock, Edge has no choice but to tap out.

Winner: Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit

Rating: 9.5/10

Match 7 Womens Championship

Trish Stratus (champ)(she too look really hot in this match) vs. Victoria

This was good match, even for a diva match(I'm not saying Divas mathces are bad though). They had some interesting moves and cool counters. Trish gets a roll up for the pin, but at the end Victoria kicks Trish in the face.

Winner: Trish Stratus

Rating: 6.5/10

Match 8 WWE Championship Hell In A Cell

Brock Lesnar (champ) vs. The Undertaker

This match was great, it truley was a classic bout. Both of these men went all out of each other. There were weapons. awesome moves, and lots of blood. It was cool when hit the Last Ride from the turnbuckle. This also had a sweet ending to finish the match. Taker goes for the Tombstone Piledriver, but Brock counter and changes it into his own Tomstone Piledriver, but instead he changes it into the F-5, it connects and he gets the pin. This match went down to become one of my favorite mathces of all time.

Winner: Brock Lesnar

Christian & Chris Jericho Vs. Booker T & Goldust

The opening match on any pay-per-view card has one objective and that is to warm up the fans, get them in the mood for the rest of the show. Some matches fail to do this and some end up stealing the show from the main event.

This match was a bit of a hit & miss affair. Booker T and Goldust were a very 'over' tag team and Christian & Chris Jericho, at the time, were two very effective heels that gelled brilliantly as a tag team.

Overall it was a rather solid performance from both tag teams, and I could happily point out about ten other opening pay-per-view matches that were far worse, but there was something missing, I'm struggling to pinpoint what that exactly was though.

During the match a freak incident occurred which threatened to ruin the entire match but all four men showed their professionalism and continued the match to it's conclusion.

Rating:  7 out of 10.

Torrie Wilson Vs. Dawn Marie

If you want to see two talentless women scratching and pulling each others hair then I suggest you nip down to your local nightclub/pub, it will be basically the same thing as what these two did, only slightly more entertaining!

Giving these two pay-per-view time is a slap in the face to every talented WWE wrestler who never gets a look in.

Rating: 0 out of 10.

Rob Van Dam Vs. Ric Flair

Two completely different wrestling styles came into the ring and clashed in this encounter. After the previous match, between Torrie Wilson & Dawn Marie, this one seemed like a match of the year contender; which of course it as not!

Rob Van Dam seemed to have forgotten how to sell a move convincingly for huge chunks of the match and Ric Flair's age really did show in some spots, but on the whole quite an enjoyable outing from both sides.

Rating: 6 out of 10.

[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]

Jamie Noble Vs. Tajiri

In today's World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-views you will be hard pushed to see, or remember, a great cruiserweight match, this is mainly due to ""creative"" giving them five minute matches......and Vince McMahon telling them to tone down their moves won't help either.

Never-the-less Jamie Noble and Tajiri gave us a very good account of themselves and had easily the second best match of the night in my, eyes. If you are a fan of good wrestling, and fast-paced action, then you will thoroughly enjoy this match!

Rating: 8 out of 10.

[Winner Takes All Match]

Triple H (Raw Champ) v Kane (IC Champ)

The storyline leading up to this horrible ""match"" was that Kane had murdered a girl called Katie Vick. Cue weeks of Triple H trying to have sex with a mannequin that was meant to be the dead girls body - what were they smoking when they came up with this!?

Both the Raw heavyweight championship and the Intercontinental championship were on the line in this match so you would expect this encounter be to a gripping affair, laced with good wrestling throughout.

Nope.

This match was a total disappointment to me and I would say this was THE worst match I have seen both men put on in their careers, and believe me there have been a few stinkers from each wrestler in their time.

Rating: 4 out of 10.

[Smackdown Tag Team Championships]

Edge & Rey Mysterio Jnr Vs. Chris Benoit & Kurt Angle

Any match that involves both Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit is going to be nothing else but match of the year material and they did not disappoint in this one. Even Rey Mysterio and Edge managed to bring their A game to the dance.

This match had it all. Fast-paced action, great reversals, awesome moves, hilarious comedy spots and even the crowd was 100% behind the match from start to finish.

If you are think of buying this DVD then this should be your number on reason right here!

[Women's Championship]

Trish Stratus v Victoria

I'm not particularly a big fan of World Wrestling Entertainment women wrestling matches, I find them very boring and tedious. But this one was not that bad and was bordering on the quite enjoyable at times.

[Hell in a Cell Match]

[Smackdown Championship]

Brock Lesnar Vs. The Undertaker

Well this was the match that the entire pay-per-view was being built around. None of the other match anything anything as far as World Wrestling Entertainment were concerned, they were merely crowd warm-up matches.

The match was quite a bloodfest as Undertaker bled all over the place. Undertaker has a reputation of being lazy in the ring and not putting over his opponent, but this match was different as Undertaker did his best to make Brock Lesnar look like a million dollars.

It was certainly a strong finish to the pay-per-view and is worth checking out.

-Torrie Wilson vs Dawn Marrie: Slightly below average womens wrestling match between above average looking women. Better than I expected but thats not saying a whole lot.
4.5/10
-Rob Van Dam vs Ric Flair: Solid match between two guys with very different styles. The old Legend and the new era's high flyer combine for a good showing. Nice mix of both guys styles in the match.

-Jamie Noble vs Tajiri: Cruiserweight title match between two underrated workers. This match went extremly well with both guys on top of they're game all match long. Definitly the surprise match of the night, I thought it would be good but it was almost Great thanks to a very strong showing by Tajiri in all facets of his wrestling skills. This match makes me wanna see more Tajiri matches vs the likes of Noble,Mysterio,Chavo ect.
8.5/10
-Triple H vs Kane: This was the last Intercontinental match(before they brang it back a nice while ago) and Kane and Triple where also wrestling for the World Heavyweight Championship belt to boot. You'd figure a high profile match for the two belts would be pretty good, but this was almost as terrible as the Katie Vick storyline leading up to the match. It was really horrible, the worst Triple H match i've seen this decade.
2.5/10
-Edge and Mysterio vs Angle and Benoit: This was the first Smackdown tag team Championhip match and all the guys where on they're A game(even a sick Edge) and got the crowd really into this match. Mysterio set a really fast pace in this match that Angle and Benoit more than kept up with and when you add some funny antics between Mysterio and Angle, alot of perfectly excucted moves and some really great aireal maneuvers you get an awsome match. One of the best tag matches ever. Truly awsome skill on display.
9.5/10
-Trish vs Victoria: A decent womens match that these two have topped plenty of times in the past 2 years. These two are alot better today than they where back when this match happened, they've obviously worked hard to improve they're wrestling ability.
5.5/10
-Lesnar vs Undertaker: This Hell In A Cell match was a hell of a match(no pun intended). Taker and Lesnar really beat the crap out of each other and it was entertaining for all the 25 odd minutes it lasted. Lesnar was definitly one of the best rookies in wrestling history. Heyman adds to the allready great match with his crazy and emotional rants from outside the cage.

World Tag Team Championship (RAW)

Chris Jericho and Christian v. Goldust and Booker T

Was for sure a quality opener, as all four of these guys are unique personalities to say the least. The match went well but when the rope broke, it seemed to struggle to gain it's pacing again. Nothing spectacular but a very passable opener. **

Dawn Marie v. Torrie Wilson

This was just awful. Nothing compared to the ladies match later in the evening. Rolling around, hair pulling, yeah.. nothing. DUD

Ric Flair v. Rob Van Dam

I was pleasantly suprised by this match. Flair managed to keep up with the far more athletic and youthful Van Dam, who carried Flair to a decent offering. RVD hit an absolutely sick frog splash to end the match. Good effort by both **1/2.

WWE Cruserweight Championship

Jamie Noble v. Tajiri

Quite honestly, I expected a lot more from these two. The match as a whole wasn't really at all bad, just very bland considering the talent. Okay, but nothing to write home about. **

World Heavyweight Championship and Intercontinental Championship

Triple H v. Kane

These two just don't mix. Add in a horrible storyline and it doesn't make for much. It's amazing how quickly Kane's character hit the skids after this feud. Nothing really adds up at all in the match with only one decent high spot. **

WWE Tag Team Championship

Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit v. Rey Mysterio and Edge.

This is quite simply the greatest tag team match i've ever watched, and even moreso, the best WWE match I've EVER seen. Innovative, fast paced, dramatic, this match really is almost flawless. I'm going to give this match *****. It's seriously the only WWE match i've ever given this rating to. Absolutely incredible.

WWE Women's Championship

Trish Stratus v. Victoria

This was the first encounter between these two and honestly, they put on a very good match, with Trish getting over her agility and Victoria displaying some impressive female power. Nothing compared to their Survivor Series no dq match the next month, but very solid stuff from the ladies. **

WWE Championship-- Hell in a Cell

Brock Lesnar v. The Undertaker

To this point, this was the best hell in a cell match ever. The psychology was incredible as was the Undertaker's selling. Nothing over the top ala KOTR 98 and nothing really fixed like NWO 2000. Just what this match should be. There were some slip ups and Heyman WAS a little too obnoxious for my taste, but it doesn't take away from what was a sincerely good match. ****

Overall, No Mercy is a little all over the place. Mysterio/Edge-Angle/Benoit was sincerely the best WWE match i've seen to date and is really about as good as the WWE gets. Lesnar-Undertaker was a fantastic main event as well. Van Dam and Flair suprised while Noble-Tajiri and Triple H-Kane sorely dissapointed.

1807907,4,B00007ELMV,"Pretty decent PPV put on by the WWE.  This PPV features the match WWE Magazine picked as match of the year.

1. Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Goldust & Booker T (World Tag Titles)

Good way to kick off the show.  Entertaining match.  It is pretty crazy when Jericho goes for a Lionsault and the middle rope snaps.  Likely he is okay and manages too improvise.  (8/10)

2. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie

The first of two women's matches (why Vince why) on this PPV.  This was the beginning of their fued involving Torrie's dad, Al.  (1/10)

3. Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair

This match stemmed from the incident at Unforgiven.  Nothing too exciting.  About what was expected from the match.  (7.5/10)

4. Jamie Noble vs. Tajiri (Cruiserweight Title)

Good, but short match.  Tajiri nails Noble with a pretty sick Tornado DDT out of the corner.  (7.5/10)

5. Kane vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight/Intercontinental Unification Match)

How could the WWE get rid of the Intercontinental title.  Kane was on a good streak heading into this fued, having won the great TLC match on RAW Roulette.  This match occured because of the Katie Vick incident. (One of the worst and sickest angles in WWE history).  Good match.  Nothing too exciting.  This is when RAW was really struggling.  (8/10)

6. Chris Benoit & Kurt Angle vs. Edge & Rey Mysterio (Finals of the WWE Tag Title Tournament)

Quite simply put:  This is one of the best pure tag team matches you will ever see.  The action was non-stop from the beginning.  The four men worked amazingly together.  Good finish with a lot of near falls.  On an interesting note, Edge was very sick with the flu in the match.  It states it on the extras.  This is one of the top ten matches of the year in my opinion.  (9.5/10)

7. Trish Stratus vs. Victoria (Women's Title)

The second women's match of the night.  (Again.  Why Vince, why)?  Who cares who wins.  (2/10)

8. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (WWE Title/Hell In A Cell)

This was the match WWE Magazine voted match of the year.  It is a good match, but not match of the year.  I wouldn't even put it in my top 15.  Good match.  It is in essence, a Street Fight.  Good match with a lot of blood.  Taker bleeds like crazy.  Good finish with a lot of reversals and close falls.  (8.5/10)

Good DVD.  It is not a must have.  If you are a fan of good wrestling pick it up just for the Tag Title Tourney Final match.  It is worth the price alone.

( Match Reviews )
--- World Tag Team Championship Match - Chris Jericho and Christian Vs Booker T and Goldust ---
Everyone does great in this exciting opening match, Goldust especially surprised me as he brang to the table some unique moves. During the match the ring ropes break however all the wrestlers do a very good job of continuing the match. The finish of this good match is great. (6.5/10)
--- Torrie Wilson Vs Dawn Marie ---
This match is just full of sloppy move, the referee skit that is done in this is over used way to much. The match also includes a bad pace and ending, this whole match is pretty terrible. (1.5/10)
---Rob Van Dam Vs Ric Flair ---
In this match Ric Flair does some of his dirty tricks and RVD does some of his unique moves. I don't mean to be picky but RVD oversells his leg in this match.  The competitor's styles are very different but they didn't work to bad together. Now not to stir controversy but for an Ric Flair match this was pretty good however for a RVD match I believe this was below average, overall it was just allright. (5.5/10)
--- WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match - Jamie Noble Vs Tajiri ---
This match starts off quickly however the pace eventually slows down more then the usual cruiserweight match up. There are some unique moves in this, Tajiri's counter to the sunset flip is pretty cool. Tajiri does his usual kicks as well as show off some of his amazing flexibility and submission wrestling. This is a pretty decent match however the ending is controversial. (5.5/10)
--- World Heavyweight and Intercontinental Championship Unification Match - Triple H Vs Kane ---
This match also contains many sloppy moves, there is repetitive chokes and neck breakers and a never ending amount of punching and kicking. The commentary about Katie Vick never ends threw out this match. There where a few interference's that gave the crowd some life as they where dead most of the time. The spanish announce table breaks during this however it is done poorly, the ending is also pretty poor. Its good that the WWE has decided to bring back the Intercontinental belt because this would've been a bad way to end the amazing history of the title. (3.5/10)
--- WWE Tag Team Championship Match - Edge and Rey Mysterio Vs Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit ---
The pace in this match is just about perfect as it moves faster and faster as it moves on. There are quite a bit of moves done off the turnbuckles, there are some cool reversals, technical wrestling, powerhouse moves, close submission victories, a ton of close pin falls and some awesome and unique double team moves. The whole ending of this match is just tremendous and you can tell that the crowd thinks the same by watching them. This match is just great, not only is the ending good but it's also clean. (9/10)
--- WWE Women's Championship Match - Trish Stratus Vs Victoria ---
This match is just a filler before the main event, it is the second women match of the night. This match contains its share of sloppy moves including a horribly done sunset flip, the ending is bad as well. (2.5/10)
--- Hell in a Cell Match for the WWE Championship - Brock Lesnar Vs Undertaker ---
The Undertaker's cast and the cell itself really came into play in this match, Paul Heyman gets pretty annoying although he is sometimes funny. Undertakers attempts at a couple of high fly moves are failures. The pace sometimes moves slowly in this match however the WWE shows more then enough replays during this every time the action dies. The length and finish to this match are great and the competitors did not make it out of the cage which is the purpose of hell in a cell. This is a very bloody match. (7.5/10)
( Extra Features )
There are a fair bit of extra features included on this DVD. There is a pretty well done History of the Intercontinental Championship, The No Mercy Commerical called ""Trick or Pete"" plus the making of Trick or Pete. There is 4 Sunday Night Heat Interviews plus 8 Post Match Interviews where the wrestlers are out of character. This DVD also includes the endings to the 2 Smackdown Tournament Semifinals Matches from Toronto on October 17, 2002, those matches are Edge and Rey Vs Ron Simmons and D'Von and Benoit and Kurt Vs Eddie and Chavo Guerrero. (7/10)
( Overall DVD )
There are better 2002 ppv's out there however, in my opinion there are no better tag team matches in 2002 then the tag team championship match presented by Smackdown in this show. Most of the matches are in the average catergory however there is some footage that is worth watching at least once. The ppv is also accompanied by great promo's threw out No Mercy and pretty good extra features. This is a pretty good DVD to add to a collection however I would say rent it or borrow it before buying it. Its up to you though.",1056240000,,5224,4.51636747624076

Jamie Noble and Tajiri are both so good and so underrated it's a shame for them to have such an awful finnish spoild a decent match.

1807923,2,B00007ELMV,"With a lot of storylines carrying over from the Unforgiven pay-per-view, the WWE decided to grab the interest of fans with a Hell in a Cell Match as well as a winner-take-all contest. However, as was the case for many of the PPV's of 2002, No Mercy failed to deliver the ingredients necessary to serve up a solid show.
World Tag Team Championships:
Christian & Chris Jericho vs. Booker T. & Goldust
I will say this, the WWE does know how to start off a PPV strong. Very exciting opener, a lot of fast-paced competition. The only thing that had ""No Mercy"" were the ropes as one superstar displays in the match. *** stars.
Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie
The worst women's match that I possibly have ever seen. Sloppy action the whole way around. No stars.
Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair
One of the storylines that carried over from Unforgiven. This match is a ""snooze-fest,"" with RVD trying desperately to get a decent match from the ""Nature Boy."" Decent ending
*1/2 stars.
WWE Cruiserweight Championship:
Jaime Noble vs. Tajiri
A lot of lethal maneuvers gives this match some enjoyable moments but nothing spectacular. Controversial ending. ** stars.
World Heavyweight vs. Intercontinental Championship:
Winner-Take-All
Triple H vs. Kane
One question that I had going into this match is why it was a Winner-Take-All, when this would be the last time that anyone would see the I-C title? Anyway, boring in the beginning, good in the end, different from other single matches with Kane. Another controversial ending  **1/2 stars.
WWE Tag Team Championship:
Edge & Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit
First time that WWE Tag Team Champs would be crowned in WWE history, but no build-up. However history in a good way was made. This has got to be the first time that a Match of the Year Candidate could be found in a tag team match, because this match from start-to-finish was a classic. Nice, clean ending as well. ****3/4 stars.
Women's Championship:
Trish Stratus vs. Victoria
A lot better than the previous women's match. Trish and Victoria have great ring chemistry. Nice match **1/2 stars.
WWE Championship:
Hell in the Cell Match
Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker
Yet another confrontation that began at Unforgiven and helped hype this PPV. Was there blood? yes. And was there violence? yes. But still did not save the match. Too much of the same offensive moves were being used by both men. But it was a lot better than Taker's Hell in the Cell match with the Bossman at Wrestlemania 15. ***1/2 stars.
Overall, a very tame PPV, which is not even close to being the best No Mercy. For one of the best No Mercy's purchase the 2001 PPV. A very solid card resulting in a strong PPV.",1046649600,,2674,4.701492537313433

Triple H again stinks up the pay per view with a very boring and dull match with Kane. Triple H needs to start putting guys like Booker T and RVD over instead of wrestling guys like Kane for the 5,000th time. Lesner-Undertaker ""Hell In A Cell"" is a decent enough match for what it is, but doesn't really pick up till the end. Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit save the show with a great performance.

7975539,5,B00007ELMV,"1.) WWE World Tag Team Championship Match: Chris Jericho (c) and Christian (c) vs Booker T and Goldust

The show starts off with an awesome Tag Team battle between these 2 teams with fair paced action. Jericho and Christian do a fantastic job at working over Booker and Goldie with a ton of illegal and dirty team moves. An incident takes place nearing the end of the match where Jericho attempts a Lionsault but the ring's second rope completely snaps causing Jericho to botch the move. In the end, Jericho bulldogs Goldust on one of the championship belts and hits a moonsault off the top turnbuckle for the win. Great match to kick off No Mercy from 2 of the best Tag Teams that Raw had to offer back in 2002

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Funaki interviews Al Wison about his involvement with Dawn Marie after being found in the shower with her. Al quotes Bill Clinton from his 90s sex scandal saying he didn't have sexual relations with her which gets a little bit of laughter out of the crowd

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Dawn Marie vs Torrie Wilson

Basic diva's match here. The Torrie/Dawn feud was a horrible one and the action they offered here wasn't incredible either. The highlight of the match is referee Mike Sparks where he intentionally rolls himself in a catfight that Dawn and Torrie got involved in. Torrie gets the win with a swinging neckbreaker on Dawn for the win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Ric Flair vs RVD

Pretty standard and entertaining match to see here as RVD was looking to gain some revenge on Ric Flair after he cost him the World Title a month before at Unforgiven. RVD gets the win over Flair with the 5 Star Frog Splash for the win

Backstage segment with Big Show who's pissed telling Eric Bischoff he hasn't been on a PPV since July and threatens Bischoff to put him in the main event or he'll snap his neck

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match: Tajiri vs Jamie Noble (c) w/Nidia

Awesome cruiserweight bout here! Cruiserweight matches were always impressive back then and this one was no exception. Tajiri displays a variety of his finest high-impact, quick and technical moves while Noble does a lot of ground work. Nidia gives Jamie Noble leverage for a victory roll pin, allowing him to get the win and retain the championship.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) IC Title vs World Title Unification Winner Take All Match: Kane (Intercontinental Champion) vs Triple H (World Heavyweight Champion) w/Ric Flair

The whole reason for this match taking place was just horrible and probably one of the worst if not THE worst storyline in WWE history. If you haven't figured it out yet, this match was based off the infamous Katie Vick storyline that plagued the main event scene of Raw throughout October of 2002 and even contradicted the Kane character. The match itself was decent but not enough to redeem itself of the brutal meaning for the match taking place. The match moves pretty slow for the entire way through. Things pick up a bit near the end. Following an interference from Ric Flair, a sledgehammer shot, and a Pedigree, Triple H retains the title. Kane should've won but this was during Triple H's reign of terror where he retained the title at nearly every cost so it's not much of a surprise that he retained

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio and Edge

This match is easily one of the best to ever take place in WWE. Smackdown had recently gained their own Tag Team Championships, exclusive to their brand, which is where the Smackdown 6 originated. The Smackdown 6 consisted of 3 pairs of Tag Teams: Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Los Guerreros. This match consisted of 4 of the 6 competing in this classic and historical bout for the right to be the first Smackdown Tag Team Champions. If you want breath-taking, jaw-dropping action that'll leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more, look no further than this match right here. It can be said that this match stole the show and I won't argue with anyone who says so! After an exhilarating 20+ minute wrestling bout, Angle makes Edge tap to the Ankle Lock and we have our first Smackdown Tag Team Champions! Wrestling Observer Newsletter voted this match as 2002 Match of the Year and for great reason. Simply amazing!

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWE Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus (c) vs Victoria

Decent Women's Championship bout at a time when women's wrestling was still taken seriously and mattered in WWE. Trish and Victoria meshed well with each other in the ring and always put a nice series of matches. Trish retains with a roll up on Victoria but Victoria jumps Trish in the post-match with a kick to the face

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWE Championship Match: Brock Lesnar (c) w/Paul Heyman vs The Undertaker

Capitalizing No Mercy was this epic, brutal, and bloody Hell In A Cell match for the WWE Championship. A lot of personal riding laid on this match as Brock had broken Taker's hand going into the PPV so you knew it was going to be a good one to see. Things start off like a normal wrestling match but it instantly turns violent as the cell's environment comes in to play. The match turns bloody within 10 minutes as Brock draws first blood but it's ultimately Taker who's face becomes a pool of blood when it's all said and done. Hell, even Heyman gets busted open! When the smoke cleared it was Brock Lesnar who stood tall as he impressively reversed a Tombstone Piledriver into an F5 for the win. Probably the best match Brock Lesnar and Taker have ever had against each other. WWE did a nice job at booking Lesnar in 2002 by having him beat all the greats. Hogan, Rock, and then Undertaker. Epic battle to close out the night

Overall: No Mercy 2002 was a solid PPV to say the least. The Kane vs Triple H feud/match dampers it slightly but overall No Mercy was incredible! If you don't already own this PPV, I highly recommend buying it and adding it to your collection.",1414454400,,6751,5.398667935299715
7975540,5,B00007ELMV,This was such a grate ppv I remeber back and this was one of the best ppvs of 2002. Loved it a must by for any wwe collector. Just every match was off the chart so entertaining. From the Triple How VS Kane To Undertaker VS Brock Lesnar but I must say in my opinion the match that stole the show was the tag match for the first ever wwe tag team titles. Edge Rey Mysterious Kurt angle and Chris Benoit Did such amazing job both by story telling and in ring performance one of the best Tag Team matches in history. Made me realize why I love WWE again.

chris jericho & christian vs booker t & goldust
good choice fo an opener good spots. the crowd had a good pop for booker t. the second rope broke on jericho when he went for the lionsault. good ending with jericho getting on the top rope and lionsaulting for the win.

Torrie vs Dawn Marie
nothing very special just a divas macth. the referee gets a lil frisky with Dawn.

Rob Van Dam vs Ric Flair
Good match reason being the different styles in the ring rvd had some good spots with flair being the dirty with low blows here and there.

Triple h (world champion) vs kane (IC champion)
first of all it was stupid because it was winner take all it was just the last match with the ic title. so it was just a world title match. what sucked was that they made kane loose to the game which sucked. that was the perfect time for kane to win the title it was his prime. not much wrestling kane chokeslams hhh through announce table. flair comes out to cheat for the lame. kane chokeslams flair then the game pedigrees for the win.

7975544,4,B00007ELMV,"No Mercy was an event that had so many idiotic storylines leading into the ppv. Of course the the most ridiculous storyline out of the bunch was the whole Katie Vick saga between Kane & Triple H. Thankfully the ppv made up for these horrible stories. The ppv would have been a 3 star event but I gave it a 4 because of the awesome Hell in a Cell match and the tremendous tag team bout between Angle/Benoit and Edge/Mysterio.

1. World Tag Team Titles
Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Booker T & Goldust
This match was a good choice for an opener. The match went at a steady pace. Booker had the best showing out of the four. Watch out for the ropes breaking on Jericho towards the end of the match. A very good way to open up the ppv. 3.5/5

2. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie
This was defiantely the worst match on the card. Even though the two gals kind of impressed me here, the match was still on the sucky side. Torrie did however pulled off a suplex and neckbreaker & a few other nice moves which I was a little shocked to see but this aint anything special. This match is pretty much skip material. 2/5

3. Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair
This was a revenge match for RVD for when Flair screwed RVD in his title match at Unforgiven. RVD & Flair has totally, complete different styles of wrestling but these two really worked well with each other in the ring. Van Dam came out pretty sharp, sticking it to Flair in the early going. Once Flair got the advantage he soon works on the leg of Van Dam. Flair really gets dirty in this match. This is one that I can watch again. 3.75/5

4. Cruiserweight Title
Jamie Noble w/ Nidia vs. Tajiri
The cruiserweights put on a nice back and forth match up. Tajiri sure gives Noble a mouthful of kicks. They had a good back and forth mix up with some nice reversals. It had an entertaining after match segment going on. A fun match to watch. 3.5/5

5. Winner Take All
World Champion Triple H vs. Intercontinental Champion Kane
This match could have been a tons of a lot better if they weren't working with the stupid Katie Vick story. That whole thing really degrated the match. Kane and Triple H tryed their hardest to put on a good match. It went very slow at times in the match. It had a few run-ins by Flair and Hurricane where HHH pedigreed Hurricane on the floor. This match defiantely could have been better but it was mostly a disappointment than anything. 3.5/5

6. WWE Tag Team Titles
Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit vs. Edge & Rey Mysterio
This match was a perfect demonstration on what a 5 star tag team match should be like. These four men brought their game and then some to this match. All four men looked very good. The match had some good counters, reversals, and back and forth action. Edge & Mysterio work very well as a team. Angle & Benoit mostly did their own thing once they were in the match. This was a great and competitive tag team match. If it weren't for the hell in a cell, this match would have been match of the night. Fantastic match. 5/5

7. Women's Title
Victoria vs. Trish Stratus
Good match, much better than the one between Torrie & Dawn. It had some good outside ring action. Trish were using her kicks to Victoria's face very effectively. Nice wrestled women's match. 3.25/5

8. Hell in the Cell for the WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman vs. Undertaker
This was an awesome and brutal match. Undertaker & Brock showed us how differently a hell in the cell match can be, being just as brutal and sedistic fighting in the cell and not out. Taker bleeds buckets in this one. Taker and Lesnar takes a lot of hard hitting and brutal shots. They both used the cell and other things around them very effectively on each other. This was an awesome main event. Match of the night for sure. Probably the best hell in a cell match contested only inside the cell. 5/5***

The hell in a cell match was off the charts. That match is the main reason to check out this ppv. The tag team titles match is very good as well.",1223424000,3,3979,4.30173564753004

7975546,4,B00007ELMV,"I remember this PPV really showcased here RAW & SmackDown were at this time as SmackDown showcased ""sports"" while RAW had the ""entertainment"" aspect.  This was also the PPV where they had good matches there were overshadowed by the crappy storylines going into it and we ended up getting a classic tag team match from four singles wrestlers.  For those remembering Kane & Undertaker's storylines at the beginning, you'll get a chuckle out of the opening skit.

World Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Christian  vs Booker T & Goldust - This was a good opener as both teams worked well with each other here.  There's a moment at the end where Jericho goes for the lionsault and the rope breaks for him to land on his face.

Torrie Wilson VS Dawn Marie - The beginning of the ""Al Wilson"" storyline and just like the storyline, the less said about this...the better.

Rob Van Dam VS Ric Flair - RVD's chance for revenge against Flair for what happened the month earlier at Unforgiven.  Two men with two completely different styles actually meshed well here to give us a good match here.

WWE Cruiserweight Champion Jamie Noble w/Nidia VS Tajiri - This was just a decent title match as the aftermath with Nidia was more entertaining than the match.

Unification Match: World Champion Triple H vs. Intercontinental Champion Kane - This was the brainchild of someone's STUPID idea to get rid of the Intercontinental Title so there would be only 1 single's title on RAW.  And to top that, they did this horrible controversal storyline regarding Kane & ""Katie Vick"" that honestly I'm still trying to forget to this day.  The match itself was average by main event standards but Lawler just would not get off the whole Katie Vick thing throughout the match to the point that you didn't give a damn about the unification & were just glad that the match was over.

WWE Tag Team Tournament Finals: Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit VS Edge & Rey Mysterio - This was the classic match I was talking about earlier as they put on a wrestling clinic.  Rey did his high flyin' lucha libre while Edge held his own in the ring and we all know Benoit & Angle are two of the best in the world.  They would go on to have better series of matches involving themselves & Los Guerreros but this was worth the price of admission alone.

WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus VS Victoria - The match itself wasn't much as it was short & sweet as Trish won but Victoria attacked afterwards to setup their Survivor Series rematch.

Hell in a Cell Match: WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Another great Hell In The Cell bout as they kept it inside the cage while Taker bled like crazy & sold his wrist injury in a brutal match that saw Lesnar put over as a monster.  And unlike the World Title match, they didn't concentrate on the crappy ""Undertaker cheating on his pregnant wife"" soap opera storyline and concentrated on just the match in itself.

In the end, the good heavily outweighed the bad and you also can see two classic matches on this DVD set.  I recommend if you can get past the Katie Vick thing.",1175644800,3,3079,4.543478260869565
