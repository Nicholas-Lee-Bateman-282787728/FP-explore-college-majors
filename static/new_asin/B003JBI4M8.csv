8397988,3,B003JBI4M8,"I was there and served honorably in 1969-1970 and this movie I assume has good intentions to tell the story of P Compnay 75th Rangers, but people such as myself were left out and not mentioned at all. Maybe when it's sequel is made some of the lesser know Rangers of this unit will get just due mention for their many sacrifices that were made.",1395792000,,344,4.3076923076923075
8397989,5,B003JBI4M8,"P Company Airborne Rangers 75th Infantry Division documentary speaking to what it was like becoming a Airborne Ranger and then going to Vietnam to do the job they were trained to do. This documentary has very clean film and photographs that are used. Knowing what we know about how we were viewed back in the United States makes this more important for everyone to view so you can see it was not a picnic in Vietnam and even though many soldiers came home alive, they still had wounds that you could not see and some of that is seen in this film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to know a little piece of what we were doing in Vietnam. Being a Ranger was extremely well respected and being an Airborne soldier was also highly respected BUT, being a Airborne Ranger was the Army at it's very best and I will always have much respect for the guys who did this job. A must see documentary.",1343088000,,898,4.351190476190476
