5057421,2,B0076ANKTK,"I picked up this Mill Creek set at Wal-mart for kicks, knowing full well I'd already seen--and/or own--everything in it. Mill Creek's multi-pack B-movie collections are often hit and miss, utilizing film prints in varying condition and, increasingly in recent years, cramming two movies per side, per disc, but where the sets featuring the public domain junk were kept separate from the sets containing their licenced Crown International titles, they've now officially gone and mixed the two. I'm not sure if this is the first time they've done this, but it only serves in cheapening the Crown International movies.

Anyways, on with the shows . . . (I've included run times taken directly from the discs themselves, for those who like to compare such things)

Disc 1 features four movies, two per side, all fullscreen, with four chapters per film:

KONG ISLAND (1968; aka Eva, la Venere selvaggia) Color; 1:24:05.
BRIDE OF THE GORILLA (1951) B&W; 1:05:06
THE WASP WOMAN (1959) B&W; 1:12:28
HORORS OF SPIDER ISLAND (1960; Ein Toter hing im Netz) B&W; 1:14:39

The menus on both sides bear the logo (and crappy design) of TreeLine Home Video, another distributor of budget discs often found in dollar stores. All four films are transferred from VHS tape, and have likely been floating around for years via various fly-by-night companies. The best film on this disc -- in terms of both production quality, print condition and transfer tolerability -- is probably Curt Siodmak's BRIDE OF THE GORILLA, though a better print of even this film can be found on the 2002 Image DVD, which may have also contained a longer cut of the film. A better presentation of HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND can be found on Something Weird's 2000 DVD release, which also contained a selection of bonus goodies. KONG ISLAND was previous available on a 2002 release from Retromedia, a small company that sometimes surprised with the quality of its releases, but as I haven't seen that edition, I can't say for sure. Apparently, though, that disc contained both the U.S. and longer European cuts of the film. I've seen WASP WOMAN on tapes and discs from various companies over the years, and this ""TreeLine"" presentation is on par with all of them in terms of quality: too contrasty, too soft, slight windowboxing revealing jagged . . . something . . . along the right side of the screen. Still, it's watchable.

Disc 2 features these four movies, all fullscreen, with four chapters per film:

ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS (1969; aka Gamera Vs. Guiron; aka Gamera tai daiakuju Giron) Color; 1:19:51
GAMMERA THE INVINCIBLE (1966) B&W; 1:25:15
SNOWBEAST (1977) Color; 1:25:32
HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES (1974/76; aka El buque maldito; aka The Ghost Galleon) 1:29:27

Side one of this disc features a menu bearing the TreeLine Logo. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS is the English-dubbed version of GAMERA VS. GUIRON. The print's watchable, but faded, and probably the same version used when MST spoofed the film back in the good old days, and since the MST version exists in their special GAMERA collection, this one might be worth a pass. GAMMERA THE INVINCIBLE is likewise English-dubbed (except for the added American footage), and the same print that has been floating around the public domain for centuries. Tolerable to the eyes, but just barely. The menu on side 2 here carries the Mill Creek Entertainment logo, for what that's worth. SNOW BEAST looks alright for a 35-year old TV movie (with the man who captured the infamous ""Sasquatch"" on film serving as a consultant). HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES is the fullscreen, English dubbed version of Amando de Ossorio's GHOST GALLEON, otherwise known as the second picture in the director's Knights Templar/Blind Dead series, and here clearly taken from a VHS tape containing a drab source print. This film is given more respect in Blue Underground's Blind Dead collection.

Disc 3 features these four movies, three widescreen, one full screen, with multiple chapters per film:

CRATER LAKE MONSTER (1977) Color; 1:23:48
LAND OF THE MINOTAUR (1977; aka The Devil's) Color; 1:25:44
HORROR HIGH (1974) Color 1:22:42
THE CREEPING TERROR (1964) B&W 1:16:29

This disc marks a vast improvement over the first two (and includes more chapter stops!), and is the only one in the set to showcase titles from Mill Creek's (and formerly BCI's, and Rhino's before that) library of Crown International Pictures productions. All four films on this disc are also available in Mill Creek's 12-movie Cult Terror Cinema collection, albeit not on the same disc in that set. CRATER LAKE MONSTER looks fine in an anamorphic widescreen presentation from an excellent print. Only the compression issues typical of all of these Mill Creek mult-sets may be an issue for some. But if you just want to see the films, this will do nicely. LAND OF THE MINOTAUR has been available in at least three previous sets: Drive-In Cult Classics Vol. 2; Drive-In Cult Classics 16 Movie Collection; and a ""Crypt of Terror"" double feature where it was paired with TERROR. The same good anamorphic widescreen print was used in all of them, and here again. HORROR HIGH looks to have been sourced from a print spun through a few too many grindhouse projectors. Colors are strong, but the print is excessively grainy (possibly more than it should be due to the compression) with flecks and scratches heavy during the first few minutes, lessening as the film goes on. The film is also available on a standalone DVD (with special features) from Code Red, but consensus seems to be that the print used in that transfer probably isn't that much better than the one used here. Finally, THE CREEPING TERROR, like the others on this disc, has been in a few previous sets, including Mill Creek's Drive-In Cult Classics Vol. 2, Cult Terror Cinema, and most enjoyably due to its utter ineptitude, in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Vol. 1, which is sadly long out of print. The print is expectedly drab but, as with most in this collection, tolerable if you're just looking to check another movie off your viewing list.

All told, this set brings nothing new to the market (which isn't too surprising at this point), but it's the mixing of reasonably decent Crown International movies with a fairly dire collection of already widely available public domain items (in mostly below-average transfers) that keeps this from being recommended. The one ""purely"" Mill Creek/Crown International disc in the set simply ports over existing content from several previous editions, while the other two discs are comprised of direct ports of the fuzzy contents of TreeLine's beyond low-budget dollar store dump discs. Were this priced in the $5.00 range--or preferably below it--it might be worth picking up for the uninitiated, but considering Mill Creek's Crown International-only 12-packs frequently end up in that price range and are far better value, this set may not be worth picking up at all, at any price.",1333497600,24,6953,4.975043029259897

If you are just looking for some cheap video wallpaper while you knit or take care of your 16 cats, this may work for you, but if you plan on actually watching the movies, it's frankly painful the quality is so bad.

5057440,2,B0076ANKTK,"Since I'm a fan of Robert Logan's family/adventure movies of the seventies (The Sea Gypsies, Across the Great Divide, etc) I might be biased when I consider ""Snow Beast"" the only decent film on here. Meaning, there's nothing else on here I would watch twice. Once was bad enough.

Snow Beast was made in the seventies, and it has that made-for-tv quality about it. At the least, you know that it was actually good enough to appear on a major network at one time.

Snow Beast follows the ""less-is-more"" approach to delivering its thrills. The creature is only seen in glimpses. You see it running away, you see it's sharp claws goring somebody, you hear it's noises, you see the victims lying dead on the ground. This is probably a good idea when making cheesy b-grade movies. Leave something to the imagination. There is only one scene I believe where you see the creatures ugly face, and that's when it decides to crash the homecoming party or something. Chaos ensues, and old ladies get trampled in the stampede.

Overall, the acting is good, duh, it's Robert Logan and Bo Svenson. The story was believable too, I mean, Bigfoot was almost a respectable topic back in the seventies.  All in all, I wish the rest of the films were at least up to this caliber. Unfortunately, the rest of the films on this 12 creature feature are terrible.

The two okay movies I think were the ""Gamera"" movies. If your a Japanese monster fan, who isn't, then you'll find these two to be decent.  Attack of the Monsters, with the two Japanese babes outsmarted by two little boys, is better I think than Gamera the Invincible.

The Rest:

""Bride of the Gorilla"" actually looks the best, seems to be the most ""serious""  ( as in high budget) monster movie here, but I still don't care for it. Raymond Burr is a good actor, but this type of stuff was seriously not one of his better roles. This and the Gamera movies are okay.

""The Crater Lake Monster"" is a real snore-fest. A completely stale, lifeless monster movie.  For 1977 you'd think they could do better. I guess not.

""The Creeping Terror"" was awful, but funny.

""Horror High"" is an unsettling movie about a bullied kid taking his ""revenge"" on innocent students. You may need to take a shower and cleanse yourself after watching this dreadful movie.

""Horror of the Zombies."" Okay, I'll admit to liking this one.

""The Horrors of Spider Island."" I don't know what the point of this movie was. Fails as a horror movie, and fails as an exploitation movie.

""Kong Island."" I refused to watch this, it was too boring.

""Land of the Minotaur."" Haven't watched it yet, because my desire to watch any more of this Creature Feature crap has gone away.

""The Wasp Women."" This one seemed to have potential, but they didn't do anything to go the extra mile.  This is like a lazy, cheap version of the Fly.",1406246400,3,2833,4.574257425742574
5057441,4,B0076ANKTK,"Mill Creek Entertainment put out a 12 pack around a theme on this one.  I.E. Monsters.  This is one of those times where they have brought together CLASSIC B-rate monsters.

I bought this set full well knowing what I was getting, but the combination for the price was too much to resists. If you like B - Movies, I know I do, you will love this set. I know that not everyone can go for the classic B movie sci-fi, cheesy fx. That is OK, and this set is not for you, but for those of us who can appreciate that cheese one more time.
