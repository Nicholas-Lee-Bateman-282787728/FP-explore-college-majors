4495509,5,B004XFZ47C,"I thought this movie was hilarious. It is certainly so bad it's funny. After a slow first 5 minutes, it really gets going with visual jokes and subtle one-liners.  The movie, refreshingly, is short on toilet or sexual humor and plays to all your ""ninja movie"" stereotypes.  It isn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it is amusing. It's badly acted, but in a really well-done way.

I saw it twice in theaters. Perhaps it is a movie for people who can let go of what they expect and embrace what they find.",1292284800,3,497,4.5
4495510,2,B004XFZ47C,"WARNING! In this review I list a few problems/irregularities in the film that I think should be brought up. Not enough to ruin the plot for any still interested, but is still ""SPOILER ALERT"" worthy.

 The film follows a warrior named ""Yang"" and his endeavors from slaying ""The greatest swordsmen ever"" (literally displayed as a caption for those who were curious) to heading into exile after sparing the life of a baby caring the last remnant of the rival clan's bloodline. Slaying assassin's and crossing major geographical landscapes, the warrior settles in a small town in the west where an old friend runs a laundry shop. After becoming acquainted with his new life, the warrior decides to put away his sword, sealed shut to never be unsheathed again, but foes old and new emerge on the horizon and it's up the warrior to decide whether or not to break the vow he made to himself to save his new allies.

""The Warrior's Way"" Is an epic adventure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It tries to blend Samurai & Western genres and comes off very, very thin in execution.

There are a large amount of problems with this film that'll list in numerical order

1. If Yang has taken out ""The Strongest Swordsmen to have ever lived ever."" In a fair duel, then why would a baby be a problem?

2. Again, we only see Yang's own clan combat him for the rest of the movie, so obviously, the baby isn't that important to the other clan, so, why go after them.

3. I didn't mention this but the leader of Yang's clan himself and the other ninja warriors, slaughter an entire ship crew just to cross the Pacific to follow and find Yang. But later, when they confront Yang, they rain from the sky, as if they can fly. Puzzling because if I could just float of the air onto an unsuspecting town, I would've just flown there with my mystical ninja powers and avoided the useless slaughter.

4. The town itself is a mystery, there's literally no traffic, let alone horses, yet the small populace has been thriving for decades, from what the background stories tell. (I'll get to those soon enough.) Also, somehow, there's a large supply of whiskey in the town but you rarely see any of the populace eat any food.

5. Aside from the really bad choreography, complete with the over use of slow motion, quick cuts and bad wiring effects, there's also bad special effects when it comes to the gore. Every time Yang slashed his targets, CG blood would spew out, blood that's not even the proper color, more like a raspberry-esque color.

6. Horrid acting from everyone, even the leads. Kate Bosworth's ""campy cowpoke"" accent was dreadful, Jang's very few lines weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be but it would have been better to keep him silent for a majority of the film. Geoffrey Rush is underutilized heavily here, for most of the film he's either silent or drunkenly spewing random things.

7. The back stories provided for the leads(Yang, Lynne) are shot in a manner that's simply uninteresting and dull, one is used to introduce one antagonist, who really has no motive for his actions and the other is used to show a brief history of Yang's brutal childhood in becoming a ""strong"" ninja which is really used to make up for the fact there wasn't enough money for a decent fight coordinator for this movie.

7. The CG backgrounds are stagnant, seemingly air brushed or made in Photoshop. There doesn't seem to be a gradual passing of time in the film, it's either twilight or nighttime.

I believe that if this movie makes its budget back then this could be a precursor to the way films of the future might be made. Although CGI is less costly than building set pieces and if you are going to implement one a lot more (say 90% CG than set pieces like in this film) than the other, then at least try and make it look visually interesting. Or, if you are going to have weak visuals such as this, could we at least have a decent narrative to keep us compelled?",1291420800,,3953,4.511888111888112
4495511,2,B004XFZ47C,"At least The Warrior's Way is a bad movie worth watching, once it hits DVD that is. The plot is beyond basic. A ninja type warrior decides not to kill the last survivor of the enemy, the cutest baby ever, and thus begins a journey across the sea to the wild west, with the hopes of avoiding his own people, who of course, now want his head. The story and dialogue are weak, but there are a few moments of comic relief and action sequences that actually work.

Korean movie star Dong-gun Jang doesn't say much as the lead character, though that might have been the reason why his performance was actually appealing at times. Kate Bosworth has a pretty face going for her, but that accent was way overdone. Then again, the whole movie is done in an over-the-top comic book style, so I guess she can be forgiven for that. At least she gives her character a good dose of energy and fiestiness. Geoffrey Rush gets a couple of decent moments, but I don't know what in the world he was thinking showing up in a mess like this.

I'm really surprised they didn't get rid of all the blood splashing everywhere to get this thing down to a PG-13 rating in order to earn some more money, so I have to give them credit for that. The music tries way too hard with a wannabe western flavor and the CGI has more misses than hits.

The Warrior's Way is by no means total garbage, like that other film mentioned in my title, but I would rather watch Ninja Assassin another dozen times before I give this another look.",1291420800,5,1498,4.3238434163701065
4495512,3,B004XFZ47C,"""The Warrior's Way"" combines the brutal violence of a martial arts saga, the nostalgic lure of an old west drama, and the visual appeal of a living comic book. And yet, in trying to be all those things, it ends up being none of them; what was supposed to be an edgy East-meets-West fusion is in fact an unexplainable, unpleasant mishmash of genres that really don't belong together. It's an oddity, an otherworldly import that never aims to be funny but somehow can get you laughing at the drop of a hat. It's above all a deep mystery, not only begging the question of how it was conceived, but also of who actually believed it would work. I don't pretend to be the end all when it comes to martial arts films or even to westerns, but I think I've seen enough of each to know that combining them isn't a good idea.

It might have helped had first-time writer/director Sngmoo Lee known which story he wanted to tell. There are essentially two plotlines running through the film, and neither has a firm grasp on itself. The central character is Yang (Jang Dong-gun), a warrior from an Asian land of an unspecific location and era. He was raised to be a ruthless, cunning assassin - a man with lightning-quick reflexes and an inhuman ability to stay focused. His sole mission was to murder every single member of a warring clan. When he finds he's unable to murder the last of his enemies - a baby girl - he takes her and flees, for he knows that disobeying his clan is an automatic death sentence. His destination: America, where he hopes to reunite with an old friend, who made a name for himself as a launderer in the desert community of Lode, which bills itself as the Paris of the West.

Yang's friend has long since died. Lode is a lifeless, withering hulk of a one-horse town that bears absolutely no resemblance to Paris. Stranded there is a travelling circus; it has begun erecting a gigantic Ferris wheel, one that looms overhead and looks like a rusting skeleton. The proprietor is a miniature showman named 8-Ball (Tony Cox). His troupe is a reliable motley crew of freakish stereotypes, the most prominent being a bearded lady. The rest of the residents are the most buffoonish western caricatures of any recent film I've seen. There's Ron, the town drunk (Geoffrey Rush), who also happens to be an expert marksman. There's also Lynne (Kate Bosworth), a knife-thrower who knew Yang's friend and had even learned a thing or two from him.

And this is where the second plotline comes into play. As a girl, Lynne miraculously survived an attack by a group of men led by The Colonel (Danny Houston), whose heartless exploits go no further than raping and murdering women with good teeth. His encounter left his physically scarred, and now he has returned to Lode wearing a mask that makes him look like a cowboy retrofit of the Phantom of the Opera. Lynne wants her revenge. The Colonel wants to make trouble. Inevitably, this will culminate in a climactic battle, one that pits dozens of heavily armed men against a coffin full of guns, a Ferris wheel rigged with dynamite, and a sword-toting Asian assassin.

Think this is the end of the movie? Not so fast. As Yang and the residents of Lode battle The Colonel and his posse, a legion of ninjas descend on the town and wreak their own special havoc. It seems that Yang's past has caught up with him, although I'll be damned if I knew how they managed to find him - and I mean besides their ability to listen to the ""weeping"" of his sword. But that isn't quite the point I'm trying to make. All I want to know is, which of these battles is the more important one of the story? Who are we supposed to root for? If it's Yang, then why is that, after claiming the baby as his own, she's treated as nothing other than an object for audiences to laugh at and find cute? If it's Lynne, then why is her story wrapped up before we have the chance to invest in it? This is what I mean about not knowing which story is being told. The film has two plots fighting for the same screen time.

There are other problems. Ron serves as the film's narrator, and while he says all the expected things, he's hardly a reliable character given how much time he spends drinking. There's also a painfully contrived romance between Yang and Lynne that isn't anything close to believable, probably because Don-gun and Bosworth have absolutely no chemistry together. How can they when Yang is depicted as the proverbial lonesome warrior, loved by no one and unable to give love in return? There's a moment in which Ron tells us that, during his time in Lode, Yang learned to love the simple life, especially in regard to growing and tending flowers; we would not have known this without a voiceover narration, for Yang rarely speaks and his face reveals no emotion at all. The only thing I got from ""The Warrior's Way"" was the knowledge that I shouldn't believe anything a drunk says.",1291334400,2,4915,4.536640360766629

4495537,4,B004XFZ47C,"The Warrior's Way starts off differently from the rest of the film.  It starts with a very serious, Matrix-inspired fight scene with main character Jang Dong-Gun fighting someone in slow motion.  When the two lunge at each other... a few seconds pass, then we find out Jang's opponent is the one who received the brunt of the damage.  Really strange, as is the following scene when Jang picks up a baby (Analin Rudd) and runs through the forest.  From a movie production point of view the forest scene is quite amazing to see, but for storyline purposes I was getting confused in a hurry.

But... that all changes!  Jang, who's holding the baby similar to how one would hold a puppy by picking it up by the back of the neck (seriously don't do that to babies or puppies) arrives to an American frontier town (a wild west town with misfit towns folks) and a lot of things change.  Jang decides he's done fighting for one thing.  No more killing!  He puts down the sword and becomes a harmless laundry man.  He seems to be welcomed into this town by most, except a few young cowboys.  But when their balls get squeezed they lighten up and accept Jang!

Two, the atmosphere of the film drastically changes.  There's now a humorous/playful feel taking over as the townspeople aren't accustomed to fighting for their lives and seem to be rather isolated and a little weird.  Though Jang plays it cool, he's probably thinking ""Wow these folks are strange!""  He meets Kate Bosworth's character.  She seems like a regular playful girl who gradually falls in love with Jang but secretly wants to improve her fighting skills to take revenge on the man (Danny Huston) who killed her family.

Kate doesn't realize Jang possesses master sword fighting skills right away- it takes until the two play little games such as Jang positioning himself on a wheel and asking Kate to throw knives at his body while blindfolded, and when the two take to the beautiful mountaintops as Jang shows Kate ways to improve her speed while slicing and dicing with knives and swords.  Now she realizes Jang's no ordinary man.

When Danny Huston and his group of outlaw cowboys arrive in town, well they basically push everyone around including the midget Tony Cox and in particular the clowns roaming the town- they don't like clowns!  They of course cause chaos and result in one very spectacular scene as they try to climb a nearby ferris wheel only for the whole thing to come crumbling down by way of an explosion.  Dynamite is the key to dealing to hundreds of these cowboys I guess.

Something else happens from time to time and it's kind of confusing.  Besides Danny and his crew of cowboys showing up to kill, there's another mysterious group that shows up... spiritual warriors of some kind referred to as the Saddest Flute, controlled by Ti Lung's character.  Enemies of Jang Dong-Gun.  They both insist on fighting to the death.  They show up in spectacular fashion near the end the way they appear across the building tops.  You can tell they're an ominous presence but they arrive right when Danny Huston and his crew of outlaw misfits battle the towns folks (and when Kate's trying to get her revenge on Danny for killing her family).

I like how Jang from time to time secretly wipes out several people with incredibly violent sword-slicing techniques without anyone seeing it.  Way to chime in!  Basically Jang tries his best to wipe out both the Saddest Flute and Danny's cowboys.  By this point in the story you gotta feel for the regular folks in town.  Just simple people living a fairly typical life, and suddenly hundreds of outlaw cowboys appear *and* warrior members of the Saddest Flute.  Talk about a lot to suddenly grasp!

Anyway this movie has several really spectacular looking scenes.  Whenever Jang and Kate appear on the mountains at night is a beautiful sight to behold, and of course the ferris wheel scene.  Production values are incredibly high throughout the movie.  The storyline can be confusing at times such as the opening scene, and when you have outlaw cowboys and Jang's enemy army battling at the same time, but the story for the most part is pretty simple to follow.  The people in town might seem odd at times (though Geoffrey Rush's character is normal).  It's lighthearted until the fight scenes- then gets pretty bloody.  The acting is solid but some viewers might be turned off by the strange story and characters, and how the story sometimes goes in unusual directions while showcasing the amazing production.  Otherwise pretty awesome.",1471392000,,4557,4.754140127388535

4495539,5,B004XFZ47C,"I recommend this action fantasy that is filled with emotion and the quick and unusual sword play seen in many Chinese films. It is fun to watch. It is a great hour and forty minutes. The warrior worked to become the best swordsman in the world because his dad was killed by a swordsman and he did not want it to happen to him. He succeeds.
Two clans fight against each other and have done so for some 500 years. it is said that there will be no peace until all of the opposing clan are killed. Our swordsman does so, or so he thinks, but then he looks in a box and sees a female child who likes him, a survivor of the other clan. Tradition demands that he kill her, but he does not do so. Instead he flees to America hoping to find peace.
He finds a strange small virtually destroyed town with highly unusual people and decides to settle there as a laundryman. Hundreds of villains descend upon the town because their leader is searching for revenge. At the same time hundreds of men from his clan are attacking the town to kill the sole survivor of the other clan.",1470787200,,1065,4.2254901960784315

Almost cheesy - but in a good way.  I agree with another viewer that it has a graphic novel type of look and feel.

The cinematography was also great.  Done by Woo-Hyung Kim a younger cinematographer but used a lot of effects I like... like the circular panning reminiscent of an oliver stone movie for instance.

4495558,5,B004XFZ47C,"A cool hybrid between the American western and Asian wuxia, The Warriors's Way takes place in the late 1800s and starts out with the seeming ending of an ages-old feud between rival clans.  Determined to completely wipe each out, the war seems to come to an end when the swordsman Yang (Jang Dong-Gun) of the Sad Flutes clan defeats several warriors from their rival.  Upon victory though, Yang finds that there is still one more survivor - a newborn little baby princess.  Unwilling to kill the child but knowing that the rest of his clan would want her dead, Yang takes the baby and flees, eventually ending up in west America, where he hopes to start a new life for himself and the child.

Where he ends up is the middle of nowhere, out in the desert where an odd assortment of individuals are attempting to build a world class amusement park that they think will attract huge flocks of visitors and make them all wealthy.  (Yes, it sounds kind of weird.  The movie is supposed to be strange and not necessarily realistic).  Yang ends up in the place of a now deceased old friend who'd emigrated to the U.S. years before - being the laundryman for this unusual lot.  Here he meets the fiery and peculiar aspiring knife-thrower Lynne (Kate Bosworth) and a host of other eclectics with whom he begins to make friends.  The peace isn't to last, though.  Not only does Yang's clan continue to seek him out, but the small settlement finds itself periodically preyed upon by a pack of ruthless bandits led by The Colonel (Danny Huston).  Some big showdowns are inevitable.

There are two basic subdivisions of the wuxia genre: the relatively realistic and the wildly fantastic, highly stylized.  Not only does The Warrior's Way fall into the second of those, it plunges in even further than most.  Warriors have phenomenal skill levels, seasons and landscapes can change mid-battle, and swordsmen drop in from the sky.  Doing the kind of thing is risky because it can look terrible if it's done wrong, but The Warrior's Way is like Hero or House Of Flying Daggers in that it does it right.  Viewers completely unfamiliar with the big Asian epics may still find it a bit too 'out there' to really get into, but if you like the general style you'll love this.  Also I've just got to mention that it has a very powerful ending.  I don't want to say too much about it, but it's pretty memorable.",1435104000,,2388,4.6052009456264775

The hero is played by Dong-Gun Jang. It would have been hard to find a more beautiful, sexy, intelligent man to play the hero. It is a great introduction for those looking to find out more about this actor who is so famous across all of Asia.

This is a small gem of a film. You'll know about it and your friends won't. You'll get to introduce them. The reason you never heard of The Warrior's Way is it appears there was next to no budget for advertising, mistake.

The Warrior's Way was released in 2010. It is directed by first time director Sngmoo Lee. It stars Dong Gun Jang(The Promise,Dangerous Liaisons),Kate Bosworth(Superman Returns,Wonderland),Geoffrey Rush(Pirates of the Caribbean,Shakespeare in Love),Danny Huston(X Men Origins:Wolverine,Children of Men),Tony Cox(Bad Santa,Oz the Great and Powerful),and Shaw Brothers Legend Ti Lung(Avenging Eagle,A Better Tomorrow).

This is Jang Dong Gun's hollywood debut.and like many other Asian actors. His English is poor,so you have a hard time understanding him. What was great about the Warriors way was the casting and the cinematography. There was a lot of rugged and gritty characters that used more dialogue than lines. The producers and the filmakers created a western world so real that they got too lost in the enviroment they created and were having too much fun. Leaving the audience somewhat bored and waiting for the action. Too much of the relation between Yang and Lynne were shown,along with the characters in the village. The villains were left out and only showed up when needed.there wasn't too much focus on them. Ti Lung finally makes a hollywood debut. He speaks English as well. And if you have never seen his work at the shaw brothers movies that made him a legend before Donnie Yen,Jet Li,and Jackie Chan. You need to check them out Asap.",1380758400,,1367,5.2949308755760365

4495599,3,B004XFZ47C,"A charmingly bonkers, highly stylised genre mash-up of Asian heroic swordplay movie, Western and circus flick blended together in New Zealand with a Korean star by the people who gave you Outlander, The Warrior's Way was an almost heroically suicidal way to lose $42m, but as long as you're not one of the investors or the many critics who gave it a kicking on it brief theatrical release, there's a lot to enjoy here. Jang Dong-gun is the impassive member of the Sad Flutes assassin clan who kills The Greatest Swordsman in the World (Ever) to become the new Greatest Swordsman in the World (Ever) only to blot his copybook by failing to kill the last child of a rival clan. Instead he runs away with the babe-in-arms to a no-horse ghost town in the Wild West where he sets up a laundry shop with a little prompting from Tony Cox's nutcracking circus dwarf and Kate Bosworth's frontiers gal. Naturally no sooner has he discovered the joys of making things clean and making things grow than Danny Huston's Phantom of the Opera-masked mad Colonel and his army of Hell Riders reappear to wreak havoc on the town once again. Will our hero come to their aid and unseal his sword, letting the voices of his victims reveal his identity to the vengeful clan? What do you think...?

If Cowboys and Aliens proved a hard sell to the public, Cowboys, Carnies and Ninjas proved an impossible one: even the poster art for this one was clueless and just threw in the towel. Even more than the premise, the film's tone is pretty off the wall - you'll need a sense of whimsy for this one to work for you. This is a film where every sky and sunset is gloriously painted with no thought of naturalism and where Javier Navarrete's score runs the gamut of spaghetti Western, Ry Cooder folk, slide-guitar rock, grand opera, weeping flutes, taiko drums, rhythmic machine-gun fire and sailor's hornpipe in a way that makes perfect sense in a film like this. Dong-gun makes a charismatic Eastern Eastwood, barely reacting to the insanity around him to great effect, and Kate Bosworth makes a good romantic and comic foil (""Dang, skinny, you sure know how to throw a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?"") but a little of Danny Huston's OTT villainy goes a long way, and the quality does drop when he reappears, taking much of the film's charm with him as the matter-of-fact eccentricity gives way to a last half hour of unrelenting but frequently surreal action and exploding Ferris wheels. The other weak link, surprisingly, is Geoffrey Rush's town drunk with a secret, an underdeveloped role that only gives him a couple of good moments (not only the inevitably tragic backstory but his ending a bit of male bonding with a laundry request: ""Get my jacket clean if you can. If I'm going to die, I want to look good doing it"") and a lot he fails to bring much to.

The second half is never as much fun as it could be - as energetically staged as they are, this is one of those films where the action scenes are less memorable than the quieter moments - and it doesn't give The Good, The Bad, The Weird much competition in the Korean Western stakes, but it's still a lot more enjoyable than it's given credit for if you can go along with the weirdness. It's not a great film, but at times it is great fun.",1374796800,3,3281,4.521885521885522

What did I like? The film is visually stunning; I really enjoyed the style. Also, the action was fast paced and surreal-like. The final battle doesn't get tedious, although it felt a bit long, because of the different styles of action within the scene; ninja-style sword fights with western/cowboy shootouts. The acting was great and I also enjoyed the music. (the whole movie in English, if you're wondering)

What did I dislike? It felt like the pacing was a little off, some scenes went by fast and some scenes went by slow. Also, although she added some energy to the film, Lynne often made some illogical and often irritating decisions.

Overall, I highly recommend The Warrior's Way. It's a unique experience for those looking for something new. As of 7/25/12, The Warrior's Way is available on Netflix Streaming.

4495614,3,B004XFZ47C,"A master swordsman with a baby meets a knife-throwing girl with a past. An evil gunman and his gang terrorize the townspeople (including circus performers), and so does a horde of flying ninja soldiers. With so many things going on but not much story to tell, ""The Warrior's Way"" is a typical case of style over substance. This is a mishmash of styles, which is often interesting visually, but the film, devoid of a compelling narrative, fails to fully make use of its East-meets-West elements.

Set in an alternate world that is far, far away, ""The Warrior's Way"" follows a lonely swordsman Yang (Jang Dong-gun), who disobeyed the order from his own clan Sad Flute, a group of assassins, when he refused to kill a baby of the opposing clan. Yang runs away with the baby from the clan, and settles in a small town of Lode, where he befriends a plucky young woman Lynne (Kate Bosworth).

As the town's old drunk Ron (Geoffrey Rush) warns, however, the stranger's arrival is followed by bloody events: return of sadistic Colonel (Danny Huston) and his men, and after that, ninja-like assassins led by Saddest Flute (Ti Lung), Yang's former master.

It's not the obvious use of green screen or the numerous borrowed story elements that are really disappointing. The action is very good and Jang Dong-gun as a reluctant hero is not bad. Only that his character is boring. First-time writer-director Sngmoo Lee seems so busy creating visuals (which in themselves are pretty impressive) that he forgets to tell a story - story about fleshed-out characters we care.

I know we shouldn't take things too seriously in ""The Warrior's Way."" But the genre-crossing action film, though slightly better than ""Jonah Hex,"" is not fun without characters we relate to. Like the adaptation of the DC Comics Western hero, ""The Warrior's Way"" simply needs a compelling narrative framework that will draw the viewer into the world it describes.",1337385600,,1922,4.904615384615385

4495618,5,B004XFZ47C,"Just about anything you do can have consequences. Some things are expected of you. Take the mysterious swordsman-assassin, Yang, for example. Only briefly is he the world's 2nd greatest swordsman. Then the first falls to his blade. Expected. So is the ""choice"" to kill the last of his clan's enemy's people- a baby girl. When he doesn't (and becomes the epitome of human compassion), he becomes his own clan's number one target hit. The onyl way to ensure his and the baby girl's safety is by travelling to America, where his only contact lives. In a high-and-dried-up circus town.
Except, things are not what he thought. His contact no longer around, Yang trying to give up being an assassin, learning to be a normal person despite his dark, blood-tainted past, used to winning, having to learn the simplest things in life. Not all is easy, especially with the crowd that thinks his ebing around won't be helpful. Until their own troubles come back in the form of a highly prideful, scarred captain. Someone with no sense of decency, humanity, willing to kill whoever and worse. And the one person who wants him dead more than anyone else doesn't know she's unprepared to defeat him. Then they find out Yang may be of some use after all. Even when his past comes back, willing to kill any who get in their way to rid him.
Some parts of the story may sound archetype, possibly even cliched, but it's balanced out with sequences of immensely stylized action, even if some of what they do defy physics (for anyone who's very picky about movies that present real-life physics realistically, this isn't your movie), as well as some comical one-liners, real-life issues of vengeance, and a unique presentation of a killer learning to be very human, not always seeking reputation, but deciding to help people instead of always slaying.
A lot of the characters (including Yang, 8-Ball, Lynne, Ronald, and the baby, April) are very memorably in all they do and say. Even characters who seem like extended bit characters add unique diversity to the overall film.
All in all, this was a real good action film that explored how to learn to enjoy losing as well as winning. Adn to help the defenseless in the face of extreme adversity.",1330041600,,2223,4.761658031088083
4495619,4,B004XFZ47C,"The tale of a superlative samurai warrior who goes against the wishes of his clan leader and thus acquires a powerful enemy so he runs away to the American Wild West out to a desert town run by former circus types. The latter have several problems of their own but the samurai warrior has a calming influence on some of them which progresses to him leading the town when it comes under attack by former Union soldier types. There are heroes, fallen heroes and heroes redeemed in this film. Geoffrey Rush is atypical in his usual role playing a drunken clown with some secrets of his own. Kate Bosworth and Danny Huston also star. Tony Cox, the black midget dude, was the funniest supporting character and had some awesome scenes. The martial arts scenes were a brutal, elegant dance. Impressive music score. Well suited for action types, especially fans of action graphic novels. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD were interesting enough to check out. The budget for this film was $42M but it only made a bit over $11M at the Box Office which just goes to show that sometimes the movie audiences get it wrong. .

4495635,4,B004XFZ47C,"Despite it's strange premise, The Warrior's Way was a pretty good spaghetti western action flick. It tells the story of Yang (Jang Dong-gun), ""the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind,"" who's managed to wipe out all his enemies except for one, that being an infant whom he refuses to murder, much to the displeasure of his boss, the leader of a band known as the Sad Flutes. Knowing this, Yang ends up on the run and, somehow, ends up in a worn-down town running the town laundry service. There, he meets a young woman with a past of her own..her family was slaughtered by a local bad guy known as the Colonel. He soon befriends her as well as the rest of the town until the past catches up to him.

After seeing the trailer for this movie, I figured that it would be a straight martial arts flick set in the old west but it ended up being something I wasn't quite expecting. That being said, it did end up pretty good.
Heck, it even left the movie open for a part two. Yet, somehow, I feel like we won't see one(as it has recieved poor reviews). Course, I could be wrong. I have been wrong before.

Overall, if you're looking for a lil cheese with your main course, The Warrior's Way will serve it up to you quite nicely. For what the movie's worth, it was a decent flick.",1314576000,,1281,4.289256198347108

Now, to be clear, this is outlandish, goofy and wildly unrealistic. If you expect anything more or less, you will be extremely disappointed. However, if you're in the mood for something goofy, unusual and yet fun, this movie is worth a watch.

(spoiler)

The story follows a warrior of one clan who wipes out all of his enemy's clan - except one baby girl, that he can not bring himself to kill. This act of mercy makes him an outlaw, and he now must flee his own clan. He flees to an old western town, where a friend of his used to live. Here he meets new friends (and enemies) and a love interest. Things are going pretty well until a long time foe of the town shows up, and he must lead a fight to save the town and its inhabitants; this fight draws the attention of his own pursuers, and now the village must fight off the ninjas as well.

(end spoiler)

My biggest problem with this film was the ending. It was far too silly a movie to attempt a poetic or tragic ending...and yet, somehow, they still opted for it. :-\ Even then, they couldn't resist throwing in a bit more silly. It was an odd combination that just didn't work. Still, the movie - in all its craziness - was worth watching, I thought, provided that you were in the mood for something outrageous and yet good at the same time.

I don't know who the main actor is here but he was amazing. It's violent and gory so not for young eyes. 5 Stars.

4495639,4,B004XFZ47C,"Beneath the pretty bells and whistles is a hell of a derivative plot. Except that THE WARRIOR'S WAY comes with enough oddball charm and stunning visuals that it makes it worth experiencing. One of the themes is that of East meets the wild wild West, and somewhere David Carradine is nodding his head and smirking, ""Hey, that sounds familiar."" THE WARRIOR'S WAY is an odd duck of a film, and I very much liked it. But, then again, no deep thinker am I. I love bells and whistles.

""There lived a warrior, a warrior with empty eyes."" The warrior's name is Yang (Jang Dong-Gun), a stalwart of the ninja clan of the Silent Flutes, and, once upon a time, his greatest ambition was to become the world's finest swordsman. He finally achieves this goal when he defeats the mightiest warrior of a rival clan in single combat. But when he spares the last remaining member of that same rival clan - a baby girl - Yang's own clan places him on the very top of its death list. Yang - carrying a stick with the baby dangling off it like a hobo's bundle - flees to the American West. But the leader of the Silent Flutes - and he's called the Saddest Flute (played by the great Ti Lung) - has vowed epic vengeance for Yang's transgression. America is a sprawling nation, but the Saddest Flute's rancor is as vast as a bottomless abyss. He gives chase.

In the odd podunk town of Lode, self-styled the ""Paris of the West,"" over which a shabby ferris wheel looms, Yang and the infant stop for a bit of respite and end up calling Lode their new home. A spirited young lady named Lynne (Kate Bosworth) somehow talks Yang into becoming the local laundryman. She even convinces him to give her blade fighting lessons. Lynne is also walking her own vengeance path.

In this eccentric place inhabited in part by circus folk and boozy ex-gunfighters, Yang finds peace of mind and he and the adorable baby rapidly make friends. He hangs up his sword, renders it affixed in its sheath, and so frustrates the Saddest Flute. It is said that should Yang draw his sword, the cries of those he had slaughtered with it will be heard by the Silent Flutes. But when a deranged Colonel (Danny Huston) comes to town, will the laundry warrior stand up for his friends? (This is what's called a rhetorical question.)

Anyone who's watched a fair share of cinema will see all the tropes fall into place. THE WARRIOR'S WAY is more flash than substance, similar in that sense to Takashi Miike's SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE WEIRD. And I'm not dumping on these films, because I enjoyed all three films. But it's like dating a pretty girl and learning that her comfort zone is more Mad Libs than sudoku. It's always neat, of course, to check out these Asian badassses dropping their Eastern mysticism on them unsuspecting buckaroos. THE WARRIOR'S WAY presents a dazzling visual style, and to gaze at the gloriously moody skyscapes is to wonder at the extent of green screen utilized. Although there's a certain vicarious thrill to eyeballing Yang and Lynne as they (sometimes flirtatiously) practice their knife dances, the most dramatic moment may have been when all those ninjas started dropping on the rooftops of Lode, seemingly from the heavens.

The Silent Flutes' arrival, in conjunction with the presence of the Colonel and his men, herald the extended fighty fight. This film, by the way, offers up highly stylized but, to be honest, pretty formulaic combat sequences. There's more fun in watching the fighting carnies rise up in defense of their home. Still, you have go give it up for Kate Bosworth's feistiness, Geoffrey Rush's, er, lush performance and his inadvertent half-mooning of the audience, and the cuteness of the baby. The great Ti Lung, who did his damn thing many years ago under the legendary Shaw Brothers banner, is criminally underused here. Meanwhile, Jang Dong-Gun bows to the constrictions of his role, and is properly stoic. I would've loved to have seen more a spark from him. Then maybe I would've bought into his implied romance with Kate Bosworth more. Still, see THE WARRIOR'S WAY for its heap of quirk and for the pretty, pretty sunsets.

DVD extras include a Behind-the-Scenes montage (00:02:24 minutes long) and 13 deleted scenes (totaling 00:12:08 minutes).",1313798400,,4282,4.7255689424364125
4495640,5,B004XFZ47C,"Geoffrey Rush of course does a splendid job as the mysterious town drunk. Jang Dong Gun, a handsome newcomer, and Kate Bosworth did great in their roles and Danny Huston was just creepy. The martial arts fits in nicely with the artistic and stylistic overall feel of the movie that's somehow set in the old west with friendly circus folk and your standard gang of bad guys. It's colorful and full of action. Now, and don't let this turn you off, but as a serious opera fan, I loved this movie. Opera you say? Without giving too much away, let's just say that the pieces they chose of Verdi were brilliant, with one of the pieces in my opinion, tying directly to the plot of the movie. I love when actors in movies react to opera as they're listening to it or when opera is playing in the background as part of the soundtrack and they indirectly react to it. Both examples occur. Someone involved in the making of this movie loves not only opera, but Verdi specifically, and knew exactly what they were doing. Proof of that is the singers they chose. No, they weren't generic unknown artists, but operatic stars and icons whose voices are instantly recognizable. I'm really not trying to give it away!!! You'll just have to watch it to see what I'm talking about. Whether you enjoy colorful action filled movies or those kinds of movies plus operatic benefits you'll be thoroughly pleased. One final thought, I greatly admire the people involved in this movie who included the opera. It's very important for opera in its original and intended form to be presented to mainstream audiences.

Well folks, don't read the negative reviews of those who do not appreciate a film that is not all action packed and sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat cinema throughout the show. This had action just in the right places. As for the actor's:  Kate Bosworth did a great portrayal of her character, as a women growing up in a desolate western town with life experiences as her only education.  Watch for the expression's on the baby's face, that will give you a good ""chuckle"". It had to have taken a lot of patience and excellent timing for those shots.

4495644,4,B004XFZ47C,"What!? Geoffrey Rush? Danny Huston? Kate Bosworth? According to IMDB this is this director's first outing and he both directed it and wrote the script. So how is it he gets to work with this cast and this budget? I guess Hollywood moves in mysterious ways but it worked well here.

Here's the scoop. A Samurai is in the process of wiping out an entire clan, but when he gets to the final member, an infant, he can't bring himself to do it. He grabs said infant, heads to some bust-out, once was, carnival town in the Badlands and tries to start a new life. Problem is that the town has its own problems and he hasn't quite left his behind. Can he save the town and himself?

Take a little Zack Snyder, sprinkle in a bit of Terry Gilliam and you're in for a wild ride. This is not really all that original as far as stories go. What this has going for it is style galore. It's a very good looking movie. At first I thought I was in for a 100 minute video game but it calmed down a bit after the first 15 minutes or so and adopted a calmer look. The visuals though do remain striking. And then there's the acting. This is a great ensemble cast. I can't remember much of what I've seen with Kate Bosworth but she's a real firecracker here. She lights up the screen and plays well against the way more subdued hero. They have a training scene that develops into a dance and it's truly wonderful. Danny Huston and Geoffrey Rush are their usual good selves. The fight scenes are good, the editing, sound, music are all good. The wardrobe deserves special note as well. It's as good here as I've seen in any movie.

As I mentioned, the story isn't all that original and I would have enjoyed a deeper look into this oddball group of misfits but this is still better than much that is out there. I'm seriously considering adding this to my library. It might not change your life but it's a good night out.",1312070400,3,1896,4.261111111111111
4495645,5,B004XFZ47C,"Where to begin?
First, it is a martial arts movie and they tend to be either really good or really bad. In this case the swordplay was beautifully choreographed and performed with ballet precision and supplemented with great CGI effects. Although flying black garbed assassins have been done before I give ""mucho kudos"" to the artful and creative ways they were presented in this story e.g. flying within the bamboo forests, bounding releases water and snow and rooftop landings like eagles nesting.
Second, the obvious play off of Carradine's Kung Fu series and Sergio Leone's westerns were creatively and honorably restaged.
Third, the superb acting, whether overstated (Bosworth) or understated (Jang), added a mesmerizing surreal quality to the sets and scenes and story itself.
Fourth, the music and sound effects were amongst the finest I've heard in any film with a range of expression and genres that blended and enhanced the surreal feel of the story. Visually, in complementing the audio, was the Kandinsky palette of colors contrasted with starkness -  flowers with desert, sunset with wind and Sun bleached wooden buildings.
Fifth, the directing and editing produced a recipe that teased every sense, every emotion, every thought from the most violent to the most endearing.  And, to do so while coordinating crews from S. Korea, Australia, India, US, New Zealand - what a journey.
Sixth, a suggestion to the writers you failed in only one regard - an homage to Dali embedded within the circus. Perhaps a poster. If you take the landscape from Dali's ""Persistence of Memory"" and replace the watches with the town then you have created ""The Warrior's Way"". A town where time had slowed if not stopped as if to parody Purgatory where people with questionable moral histories come to play out their final destiny.
Finally, I'm looking forward to what this writer/director imaginative intellect produces next.",1311811200,4,1917,5.141025641025641
4495646,4,B004XFZ47C,"First off, if you are expecting something like, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", or, ""Hero"", you are going to be very, very sad.  It seems as though the director was reaching for that sort of status with the film, but the effects just aren't quite up to snuff.  There is definitely an attempt there, as any fans of stylized movies are going to see... but it just doesn't quite get there for some reason.  Perhaps they didn't have the funding to pull it off, or perhaps it was just too difficult for the mind of the viewer (or maybe it was just me, lol) to quite switch gears from western to artistry.

That all said, there is a definite feeling here of both the artistry of Asian stylization and anime, as WELL as a western.  I thought it was fun.  Sure the plot wasn't too totally believable or anything, but heck who needs that if the movie is enough fun? :)  I really enjoyed the tortured hero/past villain staying in some low-rent, broken-down, old west town full of ""circus freaks"".  I think they were reaching for surreal there, and it accomplished that much imo.

I really enjoyed the dark, brooding looks of our hero (played by Dong-gun Jang).... but honestly Kate Bosworth's character didn't add a whole lot of dimension to the film from how I viewed it, and had a ridiculous accent to boot.  I was raised around tons of different accents and I could hardly take whatever she was attempting there, lol.

I see some reviewers are comparing it to Kill Bill and/or Sucker Punch... I personally don't agree.  Kill Bill is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I HATED Sucker Punch.  This wasn't quite a Kill Bill, and it definitely did not have the ""women are only good as victims"" vibe that I got from Sucker Punch.  I get what they're saying as far as the ""look"" of it... but I just don't feel like it reached those standards.  And even though I felt victimized just WATCHING Sucker Punch, I have to admit its look was beautiful, as was Kill Bills.

Overall, a definite four stars in my opinion.  If you start off knowing that some of the moves and plot aren't going to be incredibly believable because of the genre, it is a VERY enjoyable movie.  I will be adding it to the home collection for sure! :)",1311638400,,2216,4.443069306930693
4495647,5,B004XFZ47C,"Writer /Director Sngmoo Lee has created a brilliant homage to the films of Sergio Leone, Run Run Shaw, and Director Buichi Sato's 'LONE WOLF AND CUB/BABY CART' series with this excellent rouser 'THE WARRIOR'S WAY' , never copying the story lines but creating a scenic nostalgia for them. Narrated mystically by British actor Geoffrey Rush, it tells the story of the greatest warrior in the world who massacres a rival warrior clan but spares a female baby, the lone survivor,which sparks the ire of his father causing the warrior to set sail for the old west to start a new life.  Coming upon a deserted, wasted village, he decides to take refuge and becomes entwined in the populace there.  The film then resembles Director Burt Kennedy's western 'WELCOME TO HARD TIMES'-1970 as the outlaws responsible for the decimation of the town return yearly to wreck havoc once again.  Since the warrior lives there, samurai warriors including his father are on a big time revenge spree and the outlaws are caught by surprise.  Besides Rush, feisty Kate Bosworth and great villainy by the brilliant Danny Huston impress with their in-your-face emoting and the warrior is played by Martial Arts pop star Jang Dong Gun performing some sensational moves and sword work.  The film was shot in New Zealand by Woo Yong Kim but it seems that the special visual digital effects were created by an international ensemble from New Zealand, California, Korea, and India giving the circus populace in the village a Fellini-esque visual feel.  Maestro Ennio Morricone is also given a homage by composer Javier Navarrete in a sweeping score with operatic undercurrents. The film is released by 20th Century Fox's Rogue Movie series in a nice 2.35 digital 5.1 transfer and has deleted scenes and a behind the scenes montage as sole extras. So if your looking for a unique blend of genre filmmaking, look no further and click the add to cart button for a film which emerges as a cult classic ready to explode.",1311379200,8,1984,4.87240356083086

Attempting to live a peaceful life among a circus town that features a drunkard (Geoffrey Rush), a midget (Tony Cox), and a sweet girl with a tragic past (Kate Bosworth), Yang soon finds his peace interrupted by the arrival of the sadistic Colonel (Danny Huston) and it isn't long before the blood starts flowing and the body count escalates.  Featuring some surreal set pieces, lovely set design, and action sequences that are breezingly fun, The Warrior's Way definitely isn't for everyone to say the least, but it is a worthwhile action film that offers up enough bizarreness and quirks to hold your interest.  That, and the fact that Danny Huston is so off the wall depraved that it borderlines on obscene hilarity, which makes the film worth checking out for on its own.",1310083200,,1050,4.752747252747253

4495651,1,B004XFZ47C,"""The Warrior's Way"" is such a mind numbing example of the lack of artistry destroying movies today. Two genres that are staples of their individual countries are the American western and the Japanese samurai movies, they are dependable and relatively easy to pull with success, they've even been combined with great feat Terence Young's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Sun/dp/B000ROAPTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Sun</a>&nbsp;comes to mind. So how is it that ""The Warrior's Way"", with it's solid cast and decent budget ($45 million) failed so miserably. Well, I suspect first off it's because it was made in New Zealand, and shot entirely on a sound stage, and brother does it look it, the sky, the dirt, various background images look cartoonish. Also, a fine cast (starting with Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush) is wasted to make room for a dull leading man, Korean star Dong-gun Jang. The script is oversimplified and very non-compelling, the martial arts action all shot CGI and looking very fake, and a spiritless third act weirdness leaves the audience asking WTF. It is also to quote the movie itself ""slower than molasses in January.""

Dong-gun plays Yang, an assassin sent to wipe out his master's arch rival and his family, being an assassin with a heart of gold, as such things go, he fails to be able to carry out his duty when it comes to the infant princess. So samurai with babe in arms leaves for the new world of the American west. He arrives in a one horse town, and he was eaten on Thursday, where a traveling carnival broke down and hasn't broken up since. He befriends the ring leader, a midget called Eight Ball (played by Tony Cox, best known as ""Bad Santa's"" accomplice) and sets his sights on the pretty knife thrower (Kate Bosworth), she helps him with the baby and he helps her with her skills with a blade.

However this town is also the picking ground for the Colonel (Danny Huston), a rogue Confederate soldier who wears a mask to hide his disfigured face, he leads a band of merry men, I mean smelly, ugly and cruel men, who make it their life's goal to pick on the circus folk. I mean seriously, their is nothing in this town he could possibly want, but he's always attacking them. Well, I suppose he does have a beef with Lynne, the Kate Bosworth character, because she is the one who disfigured his face, after he killed her father. This all leads to that third act weirdness where Yang gets the carnies to stand up for themselves and put on their war paint. There is an old show biz saying about send in the clowns when the act is dying, guess what, this is where they send in the clowns, no really. Yes, that war paint comment is true, in goes fully painted up clowns, gypsy looking beared ladies, etc. all lead by * Ball looking like the cover of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"".

The cast is unusually good for this type of material (i.e. schlock), Geoffrey Rush does what he can with his role as an old gunslinger who's taken to drink, what demons caused this we never know, it's just the way cliches are made. Rush is much to good for this, coming right off the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Speech/dp/B003UESJH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Speech</a>, this is the kind of role David Carradine would have been in the running for, but now that he has left this mortal coil, I guess someone has to fill all those bad roles in even worst movies. Danny Huston brings his sly menace to the role, but isn't allowed to do much else, and the disfigured  gunslinger went out with ""Jonah Hex"", possibly for good. The Hong Kong great Ti Lung plays the main Japanese villain, called Saddest Flute, he who wants the baby girl dead, this is his second English language film in nearly forty years, the last being the lame Stuart Whitman vehicle ""Shatter"", with this track record, take forty more. Kate Bosworth is alright, maybe even better than usual, but it is hard to tell in a movie like this, do love that silly southern drawl, though.

I suspect this movie will leave western and samurai enthusiasts both cold, I know in the US, reviews were dismal and moviegoer attendance nonexistent. There is no way in which this movie could have ever worked as it is, it is one of the few so truly pure bad movies in recent years where everything is wrong. Plus, reversionary trashing of two beloved genres key to their countries filmic cultural identities, well, that's just plain offensive.",1309910400,7,4542,4.863049095607235
4495652,3,B004XFZ47C,"This is another one of those films that I saw at the store and thought to myself, ""where the hell did this movie come from?""  I had a similar moment with the film Outlander.  I've never heard of this movie and don't remember it being advertised for.  I looked at the cover art and was bored until my eyes scanned to the name Geoffrey Rush.  Yup, I picked up this film based on that actor's name alone....well, also the story sounded like your typical samurai/Western hybrid.  So, I paid my money and took my chances.  I was pleasantly surprised to be fully engaged by the film and enjoying it for 90 minutes.  It's no masterpiece or revolutionary piece of action cinema, but it's enjoyable and fun.

It's similar to Sin City and 300 in tone, and in the fact that it gives an obvious sense that it's totally filmed all in green screen with sets and props scattered about.  The film knew it's limitations and budget and decided to make the obvious background work fit into its style, just like Sin City.  You never once get the impression that any of this is real or weighty, but you do feel the visceral shock and emotion of the story.  The visuals are ramped up to 11, and it all seems very anime' like.  Which is good, even though I am getting oh-so-tired of this by now(especially after finally seeing Sucker Punch).  This film works because it's short and zippy and feels more genuine with its visuals than say Sucker Punch or other green screen films.

Also, the acting is all fun.  Kate Bosworth shows up in this film, and while I liked her performance in Wonderland, she is not someone I get excited about when I see her name above a film's title.  She's really good in this film as a knife thrower in a circus.  She is a  spitfire and very plucky.  She has so much pluck in this character one has to wonder why she didn't employ this trait of her acting repetoire in her portrayal of Lois Lane in Superman Returns.  Geoffrey Rush, like always, is great and fun to watch.  He's becoming like Steven Buscemi or Christopher Walken in the sense that no matter how good or bad the film you're watching is when he shows up you are enjoying yourself more, and more perked to attention.  He plays an old drunk ex-gunslinger who has more than a little in common with the film's main protagonist played by Jang Dong Gun.  Gun has natural screen charisma and he manages to play the quiet anti-hero with a past with a twinkle in his eye that makes him seem relateable.  And, egads, and Asian headlining an American film!!!!  Nobody let Hollywood know or it may never happen again.  Danny Houston(30 Days of Night) shows up to play a Western villain with a heinous scar on his face.  He's great and vile, but he must be getting oh so tired of playing the villain in every action movie EVER.  I know I'm tired of seeing him in that role.  Although he wears a pretty cool face mask, and has a thick Western Drawl that makes him unrecognizable, so it all seemed fresh despite his type casting.

The plot is irrelevant.  It's pretty simple and combines well worn tropes of both the Western and the Samurai movie, which in a way, those genres have always had a ton in common with each other.  It's all about kinetic action and emotions.  The frames in the film are composed to resemble graphic novels and anime'.  It's very much a case of style over substance and it works.  The characters are intersting enough, but I would've liked to spend more time with them than the film allows before the third act carnage arrives.  But, hey, that's the way modern movies work.  Wouldn't want the brain dead kids to get too bored or invested in people or their emotions.  They might get up to buy more crap to stuff loudly in their faces during the movie.

The blu ray looks pristine, as they usually do when shot digitally and made mostly of digital backdrops.  The special features are slim.  We get some deleted scenes, most of which should'v been left in the film, and a short, shorter than usual, EPK type of behind the scenes featurette that shows glimpses of the actors' fight training, and some of the sets with unrendered green screens behind them.  That's it.

If you dug this film even a little bit I would suggest seeking out some other likeminded features like Tiashi Miike's Sukyiaki Western Jango and The Good, The Bad and The Weird. They're great, and even better than this film.  This is a fun and brisk time at the movies, but it does not live up to its full potential.  Whether that's due to antsy investors or a lack of budget is beyond me, but I would guess a little of both.  Check it out.",1309824000,2,4590,4.43010752688172

However, I don't believe that you should poorly rate this movie simply because the fx aren't up to your billion dollar ""Hollywood standards"". With that being said, I warm-heartedly enjoyed this movie because of it was well-paced between action and dialogue.  The story provided strong character development so you can actually care for the protagonist and friends. Also, the lead role is an Asian actor for an American film - a very enjoyable film.

My last words: Ignore what I say and also ignore the critiques of everyone else. Why allow yourself to be influenced by others? If you have integrity, see the movie for yourself and make your own opinion.",1309824000,3,735,4.919354838709677
4495654,4,B004XFZ47C,"I didn't have much expectations while popping the disc into the dvd drive on my labtop, but I find myself doing a bit of fist pumping during various action sequences in the Warrior's Way.  To me, the classic example of an Asian-West fusion is the late David Carradine's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000X07TLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu: The Complete Series Collection</a>.  Sometimes the fusion works great, other times not as well.

The beginning was a bit weak, but the transition to the West is where things really picked up.  The director's view of The West is interesting but very gritty.  It's a harsh world where everyone cooperates in order to survive.  The runaway assassin is eventually accepted by the town, and works as a laundry man.  However, belonging to a community brings obligations, and these obligations collide with his past when outlaws return to town.

A lot has been said here already about the fighting/action sequences.  I throw my hat with the thumbs up camp.  To me, the most interesting part of the film is seeing Kate Bosworth being taught to fight with a blade in each hand.  This reminds me of the scene where Catherine Zeta Jones is taught to fence by Antonio Banderas in the late 90s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-of-Zorro-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000ARXF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask of Zorro (Deluxe Edition)</a>.",1309737600,3,1503,6.0424528301886795

The official Blu-Ray review seems to state that this movie misses its mark, but I think it really works. The story is funny and it tries to be, this is definitely not a so bad it is funny movie. It is more in line with a less slap stick Kung Fu Hustle, and it is not laugh out loud funny it is more of a chuckle here and there to keep you entertained.

The action sequences are amazing and not too gory as some martial arts movies tend to get. Plus the sounds of these sequences are akin to the Chinese martial arts movies with the ringing of the swords and the cutting of the air, they sound amazing in surround sound.

Really this movie is worth watching if not just to watch clowns fight ninjas and a posse of outlaws, and a sniper in a ferris wheel in the old west.",1309651200,3,949,3.9842105263157896
4495656,5,B004XFZ47C,"First off let me say, this is not a movie for everyone...it is quite violent and has a unique visual style that may not appeal to certain people. This is not a ""serious"" movie-""The Warrior's Way"" is a movie for people looking to sit down and enjoy a sleek-looking, fast-paced action flick. The movie is almost matrix-like in some of the sword fight scenes. The Warrior's Way is filled to the brim with crazy action and fight scenes filled with CG effects that make the film look like a live action anime. It's very cool-even if you don't like anime.

""The Warrior's Way"" takes place partly in the world of Asian assassians & then switches to a stylized version of an old west town. The main character is an Asian assassian-turned good guy looking for a quiet life in this old west town he comes across. He meets several interesting people, including a collection of sideshow freaks, the town drunk, and of course, a spunky young woman that it the main character's love interest. Soon after the main character comes in to town, he sees that violence will follow him whereever he goes...

Yes, I admit that the plot of the movie is not very complex...(Killer swordmaster runs away from his clan to find a deeper/more meaningful life. Swordmaster must protect his new home from bad guys! Cue fight scenes!) However! Despite the plot being a bit thin,the characters in the movie are all very likeable, (Especially the character played by Geoffrey Rush!) and I think that the likeability of the characters makes up for the weaker storyline.

4495658,3,B004XFZ47C,"I suppose it's not right to let the cat out of the bag that this film is mostly shot on green screen. Then again there is almost no way you don't notice it from the first moments of the film till the last. Does it make it bad? No, but it does make it different looking than most, actually in a good way.

THE WARRIROR'S WAY takes place in the 1900s and tells the story of Yang (Dong-gun Jang), an Asian warrior who has achieved the rank of the best swordsman in I assume is China. Trained since birth for this goal, his job is to eliminate the members of another clan until they are all dead. His goal changes when the last member turns out to be a baby, a child he cannot bring himself to kill. This puts him on the wrong side of the clan and he heads east towards America to start a new life for himself.

He settles in a small town out west, a dirt covered little spot that's deteriorating and offers home to a traveling circus that stopped and stayed. An old friend of Yang's had set up shop here but passed away before Yang could arrive. Yang is given the laundry business that his friend owned and trained by a young woman named Lynne (Kate Bosworth).

Lynne had been receiving training from Yang's friend in the hope that she could fulfill her desire for revenge on the man that killed her family. Known as the Colonel (Danny Huston), he killed her parents before her eyes and was set to rape her was well until she tossed a pan of hot oil in his face. Shot in the back and left for dead, Lynne survived with the hope of killing the Colonel one day.

Stand outs in the town include the town's ""mayor"", a black midget named Eight Ball (Tony Cox) and the town drunk Ron (Geoffrey Rush), a man with a secret all his own. Together they've been trying to erect a giant ferris wheel with the hope of making this town a place people will seek out.

But the only people who come seem to be the Colonel and his men who show up one day not long after Yang arrives. Determined not to use his sword since it would magically send a signal to those who seek to destroy him, he finds himself with little or no choice in the matter.

As the film moves forward, the townsfolk realize that they must take a stand if they are to survive. Even Ron must confront the ghosts of his past to help. Before long the town isn't just taking on the Colonel but the martial arts warriors who seek to destroy Yang as well. And as with all good western's a showdown is just around the horizon.

The film attempts to mix together the western and martial arts genres and for the most part does and admirable job. Revenge has always been something that's played big in both genres and here it combines with two different stories that cross paths.

As stated earlier, nearly the entire film was shot on green screen with backgrounds and visuals added later. This gives each scene an eerie sort of feel and look to it, but doesn't harm it in any way. The film SUCKER PUNCH was done almost the same way but where it was distracting in that film it feels more natural here.

Fans of the fantasy, western and martial arts genres will find this one entertaining. They'll enjoy the action. Add in a touch of romance here (and it's a small touch at that) and you have a nice rental for the night.",1309392000,2,3260,4.236714975845411

I am not a huge fan of martial arts movies, but the preview for this one looked really exciting so I was looking forward to it.  The opening scene is great and got me ready for samurai killings.  Then as if out of nowhere the movie became a western, then continued to get stranger and stranger.  I did enjoy this, but it is not at all what I expected.  A samurai/western set in a desolate circus town (I'm not making that up).  The action is great, and there is a lot of humor, but if you go in like me expecting a full on samurai movie you will be surprised. Overall, I actually enjoyed it, but this is not for everyone.  Very, very over the top for about 90% of the movie.  Which to me is not always a bad thing. On a side note it was very strange to see Geoffrey Rush in a movie like this.  I give it a B-.

I loved the action, but wished that there was a lot more, especially at the beginning of the movie... some of the fighting was too short... but, not that I didn't like them. The acting was decent, but not bad. It was good. The movie has a very different feel to it than what I think some people were expecting. It seems kind of cheesy at first, but when you understand it more (or at least from my experience) you come to realize that its not cheesy after-all. The story was really interesting. The whole Ninja plot is not the most interesting plot-line in the story - the ninjas are after him to kill him for his betrayal.

Anyways... It was a great movie... lots of fun. But I will say that it is simply a sit down and enjoy movie with some popcorn and a snack.

I only have a few complaints though, two in fact. First, the effects in general were really good, but... what I had a problem with was some of the proportions... for instance. When the drunken man was up in the farris wheel sniping the bad guys... when you get an angle from the top looking down... it gives you the perspective that the farris wheel is really high (because many of the large tents and objects on the ground seem really small and far away from the top of the farris wheel) - this bugs me because in other scenes, you are given the perspective that the farris wheel is no more than a 200 feet tall. This really bugged me!!!

The second thing was, if you go back and watch the trailer for the movie, you will notice that there are a few short clips where the hero is in this room with dark wooden floors, it looks like he's slicing his sword through the flooring or something, and another clip in the same setting two ninjas pop out of the ground. These parts were not in the movie. It looked like some more cool fight scenes that should have been left in the movie but taken out for some reason... I don't like it when they put something in the commercial you really want to see, but don't actually put it in the theactrical release. I hope that someday there will be and uncut release (most unlikely... which is saddening) or that there are some deleted scenes and extras on the DVD that contain this missing action scene.",1306972800,22,2268,4.282051282051282

We have seen these movies a dozen times before. This one boasts some colorful characters that could have been better developed. The CG background with the magnificent colors was great.

The plot is a bit silly and some of the acting does get a bit wooden but overall the cast puts on a good show. Despite being a bit silly at times the plot stays just serious enough to keep the viewer's attenion in between the over the top action sequences.

The climax of the movie in particlar has to be one of the more entertaining action scenes I've seen in a long time.

If you are looking for a deep romantic film or a gripping drama you may want to skip ""The Warrior's Way"" But if you're looking for a fun light hearted action flick with over the top action and a very ""graphic novel"" style of art and special effects I would definately recommend checking out ""The Warrior's Way"".",1304812800,83,990,4.311827956989247

It was like watching a Playstation 2 game, but with real people, I am dead serious. Here are the effects that I'm talking about...
1. In the first sequence, when the guy kills the bad guys with his sword, the blood looks totality fake; it like fruit punch is flying out.
2. When he was training with that chick in the desert, you can tell the background looks also fake, it looks like this movie was back in 2000, instead of 2010. WHAT A JOKE!!!!! XD
3. The worst part of it all, is the explosion... Oh my God!!! The explosions were so blurry, and if you ever seen this movie; there was a farris wheel that feel down, and you can tell it look blurry and fake as all get out!

Here's one thing, the plot does not make any sense at all; why's the guy go from Japan to America, and goes to the Mid-west, in 2 minutes? That's UNREEEAAALLL!!! It take place in the 19th Century, it would take the guy up to months, to a year!

And a one another thing is, why's there a baby in the movie; I mean a infiant couldn't be a R-rated movie with blood and violence; it shouldn't been in there in the first place. I don't know why they put it in, my guess is they want to show the samurai's got a soft spot; but there was no point of putting that baby in movie, because it didn't the movie any better; it just made it dumber. :p

Over all, I didn't stay throughout the whole movie it was dumber than a box of rocks.

The storyline however is more family oriented than most ninja-assassin type movies, in fact I wouldn't even classify it in that genre.  If someone told me that this was a live action Samurai Jack movie it would have exceeded all my expectations.  (I found the tie-in with the baby somewhat ironic given the plot of the final Jack episode.) It does have its gritty moments though and will make you wince if you're watching with your 10-12 year old kids. Another similar movie would be ""The Replacement Killers"", if I had to categorize.

One disappointment--based on the movie's trailer it looks like a number of short scenes have been edited out. One is where Ron (the old drunk sharp-shooter) says ""ninjas"" when they appear in the middle of town. Not in the movie, along with some other footage.

What the movie is not--mindless violence by way of 100 minutes of Matrix-like martial arts, expressive of the deep/Zen meaning of the life of being a ninja, peppered with overt sex scenes and f-bombs (language).  If you're going into it looking for these things you will not like this movie.",1302480000,,1287,4.827272727272727
4495667,4,B004XFZ47C,"A brand new concept of Ninjas and cowboys.
Guns vs. swords.
Rare cinema moments of romance between a Asian male and a white female. Yes, it wasn't a typo, not the usual obligatory white male and a non white female as in thousands of movies.
Story was good, choreography between cowboys and ninjas was ok, effects was good.
A turn off for most white males that are bitter at seeing any sort of inter-racial romance that does not involve them, especially so one with a white female and a Asian male.
Well it's time for white males to grow up, the combination of the two was great.
Unfortunately, it's just the non white male inter racial romance that got it censored from most theaters and network broadcasts.",1301270400,,707,4.574803149606299
4495668,2,B004XFZ47C,"Maybe I am just jaded because I watch a ton of Asian Cinema. And tho I can greatly appreciate the combining of cowboys and ninjas, the cinematography/choreography were mediocre, and the character development and story development were very weak to me. I didn't really care much about the characters and the love interest chemistry seemed really blas.

I like these types of movies and would enjoy seeing more of them.

However I found Good, Bad, the Weird to be a much better Korean Western than this, tho this was much more fantasy than the other, and the other lacked Ninjas and American Cowboys.

The movie did have some redeeming gimmicks as well. I liked the comic book style intro of ""the greatest swordsmen in history"", however they should have used that more. For example, they could have introduced Geoffrey Rush this way once it reached a certain point in the film, etc.

This movie had potential but it just lacked the emotion that I find in other films of this caliber.",1299715200,,981,4.719298245614035
