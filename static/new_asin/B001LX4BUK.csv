8320157,4,B001LX4BUK,"Kaiserschlacht 1918 is a fairly good video on the 1918 ""Peace Offensive"" that was the last roll of the dice for Imperial Germany in the Great War, or WWI.

I felt the DVD does a decent job of giving the reader the strategic picture: Germany has knocked Russia out of the war, but has only a limited time to break the deadlock in the Western Front before the Americans arrive in France in great enough numbers to breakthe deadlock for the allies.

I think it does a fairly good job of showing the tactics used, but doesn't go into the revolutionary ""Stormtrooper"" tactics that would come close to winning the war for Germany and would morph into ""Blitzkrieg"" in the next war. It also doesn't show how the Germans used their artillery, resulting in short, massive bombardments mixing high-explosive with different types of gas shells to both prepare the area to be assaulted and to isolate the battlefield from immediate reinforcement.

It does show how the campaign progressed with Germany advancing farther than any army since 1914. It shows the crucial part of the battle where Ludendorf chose to split the effort and seek two different goals. This was clearly a mistake and dissapated the German effort. This, and the allied bestowing Marshall Foch with unified command slowed and ultimately stopped the Germans.

The Germans knew it was over when the troops found guarding the way to Paris weren't Frenchmen, they were Americans. This was the last roll of the dice and it failed. Germany, wracked by internal revolt, sued for peace.

It's a fairly good treatment of the end of WWI and I recommend it to those interested with four stars.",1416009600,2,1639,4.797872340425532
