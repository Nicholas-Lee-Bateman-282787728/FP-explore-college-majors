779104,5,6304107641,"For the Navy this is a test of defenses. For Lieutenant Commander Thomas 'Tom' Dodge (Kelsey Grammer) this is a test of mettle. For Lieutenant Emily Lake (Lauren Holly) it is a test of form. And for each of the crew it is the test of only that which they are capable of performing.

Yes now in the days where anyone can get his or her hands on low tech equipment, such as diesel subs, is our high tech defenses ready. Look what happened to Argentina when their submarine broke?

Rear Admiral Yancy Graham (Bruce Dern) is betting his reputation of the readiness if the Navy and will go to any length to make sure the intrusion test fails.

Now that you know the story, It's not the contest but how the people interact under stress. They did not let any submarine cliche out of this picture. Even the nervy ""lets see what depth this will take"" scene.

Look for my three favorite scenes:
When Admiral Graham is welcomed aboard he looks and says ""What is that supposed to mean!""
Lieutenant Lake being almost out of uniform.
Executive Officer Martin Pascal is forced to walk the plank.",1508889600,2,1080,4.467005076142132

779275,5,6304107641,"I have read that this film got poor reviews when it came out. I must suppose that some movie critics don't consider ""entertaining"" to be a valid goal for a filmmaker to shoot for. This film had silly aspects, serious aspects, for me actually provoked some thought, and was VERY entertaining. I thought Kelsey Grammar did a fine job of portraying a good officer (albeit with a maverick streak) who is given a crew that is a ragtag bunch of misfits, and an unusual mission (and ""higher orders"" that no one else knows about). Bruce Dern was good as his enemy (an admiral) who gets more and more psychotic as the film goes on.

Sure, some if not most of the realism is skimmed over, but this adds to the appeal by creating a simplistic story line that is easy and fun to follow.  It has been a family favorite for years. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters. It ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.",1443312000,,700,4.303030303030303

781354,3,6304107641,"Okay, I fully admit it -- this is a stupid movie.  It has little grounding in reality, the jokes are goofy and silly, and the acting is pretty over the top.  But you know... sometimes you don't want a masterpiece.  Sometimes you're just in the mood for a stupid, goofy comedy, and a movie doesn't necessarily have to be top-notch to be enormously entertaining.  And we all have our guilty pleasures, stuff we know is dumb but that we enjoy nonetheless.  ""Guilty pleasures, everybody has a few,"" as the Nostalgia Critic would say.

And despite being a dumb movie, ""Down Periscope"" is still entertaining, and you can't help but root for the ragtag underdogs that are the movie's unlikely protagonists.

Lieutenant Commander Thomas Dodge (Kelsey Grammar) is an unorthodox -- and some might say irresponsible -- navy officer who's disappointed at getting turned down for a post as a submarine commander, in no small part thanks to the scheming of the arrogant Admiral Graham, who thinks he's totally unsuited for the job.  But another commander sees potential in Dodge's strange ways, and so he presents a unique challenge -- a war game in which Dodge will command an outdated diesel-powered submarine called the Stingray, and says if he can win the war game, he'll be put in command of a top-of-the-line nuclear submarine.  Dodge is reluctant but takes on the role, and finds himself in command of a bunch of misfits as a crew -- an overeager and by-the-book executive officer (Rob Schneider), a crusty civilian engineer working the engine room, a foul-mouthed punk who'll do anything possible to get kicked off the ship, an eccentric and sharp-eared sonar engineer obsessed with whale songs (Harland Williams), a shock-happy electrical engineer, a compulsive gambler and the ex-football player who cost him a lot of money, and Lieutenant Lake, the first female dive officer in the Navy who causes no small amount of tension among the crew.  The crew butts heads, but does their best to hold their team and their leaky sub together... all the while pitted against a top-of-the-line submarine and its capable crew, not to mention Admiral Graham's determination to see Dodge fail at any cost.

The film holds no real surprises -- if you've seen one ""ragtag bunch of underdog misfits wins the day"" movie, you've seen most of them, including this one.  The cast is mostly full of stock characters, though a few of them are delightfully quirky enough to stand out (especially Williams' character).  And I'm sure the inaccuracies in submarine life and Navy protocol will have sub-enthusiasts and Navy personnel/veterans facepalming -- though at least they got the ""no women allowed on a submarine"" part right, as only very recently have they allowed co-ed crews aboard Navy submarines.

All that said, though, this is still a fun movie to watch.  The jokes are funny, and much of the humor comes from seeing this eclectic pack of outcasts bounce off each other and interact.  Dodge handles everything the crew, ship, and his rivals throw at him with aplomb, and has some weird but creative solutions to sticky situations that you can't help but admire.  His romance with Lieutenant Lake feels a bit forced, however, and it feels like Lake was thrown in to be the token female and provide some risqu jokes.  Still, I can overlook this for the most part.

It sounds like I've put this movie down a lot, but I'll be honest -- it's one of my favorite comedies.  I fully acknowledge that it's dumb, but I enjoy it nonetheless, and am fully willing to turn my brain off and just laugh for an hour and a half rather than sit down and pick it apart.  If you need something lighthearted and goofy, or just want to see an underdog pull off the seemingly impossible, give this a shot.  Definitely not for kids, though -- there's some language and innuendo.",1441843200,,3836,4.806697108066971

Down Periscope is TOO much fun... makes you wish there would have been a sequel! Guess, recent years, we've viewed several times. Each time we pick-up something we missed in previous views.

Another of those many shows where human discards are joined together for whatever happens next.  This time the well worn theme takes place on a Navy submarine.  First woman on this type of boat elicits comments that reminded me of preteen jokes long forgotten and rightfully so.  There was no reason whatsoever to continue watching this awful thing after only fifteen or maybe twenty minutes.

783015,4,6304107641,"There aren't a whole lot of comedies that I go crazy over. However, this was not only a very funny movie but a clever comedy at that when it comes to strategy. When you can an old out of date piece of machinery (in this case, an old diesel submarine) and put it up against something that is state of the art (a nuclear submarine), that is a challenge. Given that the environment is the ocean with millions of gallons of water, there are many places to hide. When you have Kelsey Grammer as the captain, you really can't go wrong. He is as cerebral as they come and he's the best!!

Personally, I find this movie's humor to be too dumbed-down to enjoy. I also think Kelsey Grammer was miscast in the role...it's really bad when he tries to play it straight or exude an air of authority.
Perhaps this movie is the bomb for others but for me, who likes a bit of intelligence and credibility with humor...this movie falls WAY short. I only gave it 3 stars because hubby would kill me otherwise...lol.",1404086400,,486,4.47191011235955

784105,5,6304107641,"My husband and I have seen this film more than once on television and now we own it and still watch it a lot! (Whew. I know that last sentence was lousy grammar but I love this film!) The formula for this film is pretty standard--underdog/renegade servicemen show they're superior to the narrow-minded, know-it-all brass. Brings to mind McHale's Navy, Operation Petticoat, Mr. Roberts, and other classics in this style. I found this film to be a comedy upgrade on every one of those greats. Kelsey Grammer is a highly creative submarine tactician whose ideas have got him frowned upon by Admiral Bruce Dern and smiled upon by Admiral Rip Torn. They knock heads over Captain Grammer and decided to put him to the test. He's to participate in war games that will decide his future as a submarine captain. His naval opponents are the best crews, submarines and warships of the modern navy, while he gets a diesel-class sub from the 1950's and the usual navy misfits and trouble-makers for his own crew. Failure on the horizon? Hardly. Grammer is hilariously upbeat, and his crew's individual oddball traits are fuel for running gags that never get old the entire course of the film. There's a radioman who's had one too many shocks to the brain and has become a human electricity conductor, a sonar man who can hear change drop on a dock while he's 30 feet below the surface, an alcoholic engineer who uses his whiskey to power the vessel, a flatulent cook and a bipolar first mate--that's just a few. It's a full crew of people like this, and they are all packed into an old sub and turned loose on the ocean and the modern navy. Feel-good fun up to and including the rolling of the credits.",1402704000,3,1689,4.614617940199335

784543,5,6304107641,"This is a fun comedy and also a pretty good leadership tutorial.  It takes some pretty common themes and weaves the story to its eventual end--triumph for the underdog.

Kelsey plays the skipper of the Stingray, something dredged up from the ship junk yard to conduct an anti-terrorism exercise against the modern navy.  His mentor sees it as an opportunity for him, his nemesis sees it as an opportunity to get rid of him.  His crew, selected by his nemesis is a misfit bunch that Kelsey manages to unite in a common goal, even if it means adjusting his crew by having one of them walk the plank.

In the end, the nemesis loses and Kelsey is on top.  When offered the opportunity to leave his crew he loyally refuses to leave them.",1397260800,,732,4.466165413533835

Aside from running the diesel engines submerged and some impossible orders passed over the 1mc there was a lot of realism of the way it was or the way it was perceived in recent history. The harmony of the crew and the eventual ""red assing"" of the XO was certainly correct! Working with a CO who thought outside the box was refreshing during the Cold War. There have been many other Submarine movies made with similiar technical and terminology mistakes that were not comedy based. The Navy Technical Advisors on those films probably had never served on a boat.",1396656000,,627,4.607142857142857

There are many hooky skits/phrases that make it just a little bit memorable. Personally, I can't stand Rob Schneider as an actor, so any time his goose gets cooked, I'm in. Though his role here is suit to him.

No one could have done this role better than Rob. The pirate scene alone is worth seeing this movie. As an added bonus, stick around for the credits.

I watched this one for the third time and was still trying not to choke myself at least 7 or 8 times.  The timing is there.  The actors pull it off with a straight face somehow.  I can list off on the fingers of one hand the number of movies that had me laughing that much the second or third time I saw the film (off the top of my head, ""Noises Off"" with Michael Caine, One of the Pink Panther movies--the third I think, ""Kung Fu Panda"" with Jack Black, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and perhaps Disney's ""Enchanted"" with ""Captain Ron"" being a close runner up).  Jeff Foxworthy's DVD of his stand up routine had me gasping for more air a few times too.

785990,5,6304107641,"This is not a great movie. I've no false hopes that this movie will win any awards. This is however, the perfect movie for when you just want to have a good time and some great laughs. You can read the synopsis to find out about the film's plot. What you can't read is how good the acting is. The entire cast are able to put a comical spin on everything keeping the whole film light and fun, but there's actual really keen acting going on here.  Above the comedy, the acting shines brightly.

I have seen almost all of these actors in other roles from NCIS to any of slue of Jerry Bruckheimer shows.  The characters they portray in those other roles are so 180 degrees from their goof-ball characters in this movie that it's sometimes difficult to accept their more serious roles.  Then again, that's why they're actors.

Some people have complained that the movie does not comply with all of the customs and courtesies of military bearing (saluting, reporting for duty in civilian dress, etc.), while some of that is true, let's not forget that this is a movie designed for laughter.  As a retired military member, I can waive the minor inconsistencies in favor of enjoying this movie.

In summation, if you want a fun movie that'll get you laughing, still present quality acting, tells a story, makes you woot for heroes, then this is that movie.  I've watched it countless times and will continue to do so.  I do so not because I'm enamoured with any particular actor, but simply because I love this film.",1378944000,18,1508,4.555555555555555

Funny, clever, light hearted, guy-mechanical, there's even a cute female Dive Officer, and you can watch this flick a jillion times. It's like Danny Deckchair or Mad Mad Mad Mad World. It's as good as Red October or K19 in some ways and similar to Operation Peticote with Carry Grant.

If you like any of the movies I've mentioned, you HAVE TO like Down Periscope. This is my personal guarantee!",1370131200,,471,4.529411764705882

786612,3,6304107641,"I'm not a big fan of Kelsey Grammer, but this is an OK movie.  I think I identify with a boatload of screw-ups.  I was never in the Navy, but the mix of characters in this movie reminds me of my short enlisted life in the Army, many years ago... There's nothing funnier than real life... er, well, this is a bit funnier, but over the span of a couple years in the military, there's bound to be some funny events, though, at the time, it may not seem all that funny.  It's a whole lot funnier, 45 years later.  Trust me.

I may be a bit harsh in giving it only 3 stars, but, as I said, I'm no KG fan.  I like most of the rest of the cast more, and the directing was probably OK, or better... I dunno... I'm no movie critic... just an average schmuck watching a ""Free With Prime"" streaming video over Wi-Fi.  The price was right.  The quality was very good.  There weren't even any ""hang-ups"" from a bad connection.  It filled my 41"" flatscreen perfectly.

If you actually like Kelsey Grammer, you will probably like this movie.  If you're not a big fan of his, you will probably still like this movie.  I chuckled... I smiled... no, I never laughed out loud, didn't roll on the floor or fall off my chair... but I was entertained.  Give it a try, unless you absolutely despise KG.

It is his last chance to get his own boat or he is riding a desk. He finally gets a boat and a crew, and the hilarity ensues.

This is one of those feel good movies that remind you what it is to be a square peg in a round world, and the hoops you sometimes have to jump thru to find and earn your place.

It's a story of an unconventional submarine commander being handed an impossible wargame mission in a conventional submarine with a very funny crew. It's a story of how thinking outside the proverbial box led most of the admirals to distain him, but for one who believes his different point of view is very valuable.

In other words - misfits make good and triumph of the nurds with lots of good old-school humor. Make it 5 stars for me.",1368489600,2,490,4.50561797752809

Having a military background myself it was fun to watch a well thought out interplay of characters in the time honored, but still stifling structure that is our modern military.  From the opening scene to the closing credits it was pure enjoyment.  Not only was this movie a comedy, but it was also a good instructional video of leadership styles.  There are still way too many Adm Grahams in the service and not nearly enough Adm Winslows.  Dodge's leadership style contrasted well with Knox's, but was the centerpiece as the foil to Grahams.  The closing scene was the capstone of this movie where Dodge gave the credit for the success of the mission to his present crew.  If only all commanders, business leaders, bosses could see through their own hubris and recognize, as in this movie, where results really come from we would all live in a better world!

It's pleasant and innocuous, but totally predictable (except when it overindulges in being ludicrous). Grammer doesn't have much to work with here; stilted dialogue and ""action"" scenes which lack action. This is all augmented by some painful and/or pointless mugging from the supporting players. Ouch.

I actually enjoy a simpleminded comedy that makes me laugh - but this one simply didn't. Grammer is reasonably charming (albeit totally one dimensional), and Rob Schneider is predictably annoying. Virtually everyone else in the film is a cliche.

I'mn clearly in the minority here, but have to say that this just isn't a very good or very funny film.",1356480000,,807,5.06015037593985

  Most comedies these days seem to rely on gutter mouths, and sick humour, but this was good clean fun and I didn't feel like I had to wash out my brain after watching it.
  Were the parameters of the story ever true, and they very well could be, one can easily see the verse ""Except the lord keep the city, the watchmen watch in vain"" coming to play.

788158,3,6304107641,"Kelsey Grammer (TV's Frasier) stars as a naval officer given one last chance at command in the comedy Down Periscope (1996).  Grammer plays Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge, a man who's spotty military record and unorthodox style, has him on the verge of being washed out of the Navy's command program.  Over the objections of Rear Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern), Dodge is awarded the command of the USS Stingray, an ancient diesel powered submarine, manned by a crew of less than top line sailors, headed by the excitable Lt. Martin Pascal (Rob Schneider), and an untested female dive officer Lt. Emily Lake (Lauren Holly).

Vice Admiral Winslow (Rip Torn) assigns Dodge the task of testing the US Navy's capability to respond to the threat posed by a diesel sub.  Among others, Dodge finds himself pitted against the USS Orlando, a top of the line nuclear sub under Commander Knox (William H. Macy), Dodge's ex-CO.  Mostly due to Dodge's unorthodox methods, the Stingray completes its mission, much to the dismay of Admiral Graham, who later assumes active command of the operation against Dodge.

Kelsey Grammer is likable as the commander of this feel good affair, that doesn't press too hard to be funny, and really doesn't have many big laughs.  This is good clean family fun, that manages to squeeze some suspense and excitement into a series of training exercises, as the proud crew of the USS Stingray successfully completes their mission.",1355616000,,1439,4.970833333333333

Sure, the technical side is lacking, and the terminology is a little off, but that doesn't matter.  The personality types are pretty true to the people that man the boats out under the waves.  Practical jokes are a way of life. Stupid side bets are a way of life.  Finding ways to amuse yourself for hours at a time while in a 400 foot long steel tube is paramount to survival.  If anything, some of the actions done from character to character are to restrained.  Our only real rules were no personal injury, and try to keep it out of the racks (beds).

This movie is a laugh riot, with Kelsey Grammer portraying a character completely unlike Frasier.  Kelsey does a bang-up job as the confident, sure-footed decision-maker, Captain Dodge (famous for getting drunk, passing out, and waking up with a tattoo on his hoo-hoo) who is assigned as commander of an ancient, rust-encrusted submarine. To complete the really bad assignment, Captain Dodge is given a, shall we say, ""most unusual"" crew, comprised of a man called Sonar, whose hearing is way past exceptional (when some coins are dropped on the floor of another submarine, he is able to determine that somebody just dropped 45 cents - he can also imitate whale-talk); the son of an Admiral who only wants to be kicked out of the navy; a loud-mouthed subordinate who tries to take over the submarine, only to be charged with mutiny, and what follows is a hysterically funny scene where he is made to walk the plank; and the ships electrician, who spends much of his time getting electrical shocks from the bad wiring, and sundry other characters, including Lauren Holly, as the only female aboard.  Bruce Dern portrays an Admiral who hates Captain Dodge, and plots to make his life as difficult as possible.

While I generally think the movie hits exactly the right tone through out, there is one glaring exception: the treatment of female characters vis-a-vis Lt Lake. The movie is clearly aimed at the 18-24 male audience and I don't take issue with the antics that ensue from that demographic marketing. In fact, I think the animal house style prank played on the dive officer is pretty funny. The issue with the treatment of women comes from the patronizing way in which it seems to treat the newly minted submariner. There also character inconsistencies which speak to a poor attitude towards women in the military: namely while the LT is portrayed as career minded and professional for the most part, she kisses Kelsey Gramar's character at the end.

788617,5,6304107641,"DOWN PERISCOPE is a gem, combining sublime comedy with Horacio Hornblower ""heroics"". This is the classic story of the British naval novel translated to the American submarine fleet: i.e. the unconventional officer shows his worth, captures the hearts of his crew and wins promotion due to tactical brilliance against long odds.

Kelsey Grammer plays Captain Tom Dodge, a naval officer with a black mark on his record who has had the misfortune to earn the enmity of a two-star Admiral who is blocking his promotion. Dodge is given the command of a rust-bucket sub dating from World War II and secret orders to ""think like a pirate"" during a war game exercise in which he is to play the part of a renegade enemy sub. The goal he is given is to attack first Charleston and then a dummy naval ship at Norfolk.

Naturally the crew he is given is a crowd of screw-ups, cut-ups, misfits and one woman, Lt. Emily Lake, who is part of a pilot program to see if women can serve on submarines. It is as if DAS BOOT just became ""Dat Booty"". The each member of the crew is given individual comic solo turns, each more funny than the last. The deadpan timing and talent assembled here make this rust bucket sub excursion more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

When this movie first came out, it didn't receive the attention it deserved. This might be because Kelsey Grammer was a TV star who didn't translate well to the big screen. It might also be because the military was not in such high favor--the movie was ahead of its time. The film almost sunk without a trace, but I recommend it highly for home viewing. If you loved the Horatio Hornblower series or the books of Patrick O'Brien or if the career of ""Mad Jack"" thrills you, than the tactical and comedic antics of Captain Dodge will tickle your funnybone.",1299888000,9,1798,4.526153846153846

788668,4,6304107641,"""Down Periscope"" is the story of a naval officer with a troubled career past who is given a chance at redemption. All he has to do is take a green and misfit crew into an obsolete submarine, and beat a fleet of the US Navy's finest, up to date warships! With unorthodox tactics fueled by the off the wall behavior of his crew, he of course makes this ""no win"" scenario highly competitive.

This film was a big surprise for me. The cast looks primed for sort of a dumb comedy with the potential to be more irritating than funny. For a feature film, it is rather low budget, putting together TV stars with career long supporting acting from film. Still, it had Kelsey Grammar, who has never failed to come through. Joining him was Lauren Holly (Picket Fences), Rob Schneider (with his own set of over the top comedies, such as ""Deuce Bigalow"", Bruce Dern, Rip Torn, William H. Macy, and others.

Luckily for everyone, the chemistry was there. The performances (and many of the jokes) are broad, as they needed to be for this movie to succeed. Rob Schneider is really the only actor that goes over the top, with the consequence that he was forced to ""walk the plank""! The cast took this film seriously and provided strong performances in each circumstance, and the result is a very entertaining comedy. I didn't personally find any ""laugh out loud"" moments, but I found myself consistently amused and interested.

Don't miss the end credits, which contain a music video of the cast performing antics to Men at Work's famous song, ""In the Navy"". It is hilarious and worth a watch all on its own!",1296000000,3,1591,4.575438596491228

The plot is relatively straightforward but the acting is good and in general the naval details are well executed whilst not dominating proceedings.

Sometimes juvenile, sometimes stupid and sometimes very predictable.....but yet this was a fun movie that is charming at times, too. I did enjoy watching this.

The humor is a little sleazy at times but the language wasn't too bad. Kelsey Grammar plays a likable role in the Navy comedy. Most of his crew are somewhat stupid characters but I did laugh at the sonar man with the great hearing. Lauren Holly was okay as the female interest but Rob Schneider was just plain annoying and tended to overact. He's either very funny or very stupid in his films. Bruce Dern, as always, was an effective ""bad guy.""

The story is a favorite of the film industry: a bunch of rag-tag misfits and rebels somehow outwit and outmaneuver the larger Establishment experts with their high-tech machinery.

788846,5,6304107641,"I really liked the way this comedy hit you in subtle ways without trying too hard, and without continuous sight gags.

Kelsey Grammer does an excellent job as the down-and-out Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge, of the low tech World War Two-era submarine USS Stingray; pitted against modern-day warships in a seemingly one-sided war game. Rob Schneider is the obnoxious and recalcitrant XO Martin Pascal. Lauren Holly is the untested, under pressure, Lt. Emily Lake. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern are the adversarial Admirals in the simulated war game.

The crew is composed of a rabble of quirky, spaced-out, ill-mannered, insubordinate and mentally challenged sailors. When the chips are down, they transform into a well-oiled war machine, under Grammer's somewhat ""unconventional tutelage.""  The XO ""Walking The Plank"" scene, and the Cook ""passing gas"" during silent running are two of the funniest.

Living near San Francisco and being a WWII historian, I immediately recognized their submarine as the WWII U.S.S. Pampanito (SS-383) museum and memorial, docked at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf.  Another plus for you history buffs.

Easy-going, relaxed, lighthearted comedy.",1228521600,,1169,5.5027932960893855

788912,5,6304107641,"Just terrific! I loved this movie when I first saw it on TV, just bought the DVD and it's even better, since you get to see the whole movie with nothing snipped to make room for commercials -- and of course the video quality is better than TV.

The disc is double-sided, full screen on side A and widescreen on side B.

Some reviewers here have complained bitterly that it isn't really widescreen, it's just ""pan and scan"" with the top and bottom cut off. That isn't true. Yes, the widescreen version is the same as the full screen version but with the top and bottom of the frame cut off -- that's the way many widescreen movies WERE MADE, folks! For example, ALL of Stanley Kubrick's movies after ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" were made this way. It isn't pan and scan. You're not missing any part of the original, you're seeing the full frame as it was before it was matted for theatrical showing.

It's the same as the ""panorama"" feature in many point-and-shoot 35mm cameras. The ""panorama"" mode doesn't really give you a wider angle of view, it just looks wider because the top and bottom have been cropped off and the photo is then printed on paper with a wider aspect ratio.

Not all widescreen movies are made this way, of course. But DVDs that are widescreen on one side and full screen on the other are usually if not always this way in my experience. ""The Searchers"" is another example. Compare the widescreen and full screen sides and you'll see the full screen side is really just as wide in angle of view, it just shows more of the top and bottom that you never saw in a theatrical showing because it was matted out.",1215129600,,1624,4.421404682274248

This movie stars Kelsey Grammer (Cheers, Fraiser), Lauren Holley, Harry Dean Stanton, Rip Torn (Men in Black 1+2, The Beastmaster, Airplane 1+2)), Bruce Dern, Rob Schneider, and William H. Macy.

The movie is basically about Lt. Dodge (Grammer) who is looking to command a state of the art submarine. He gets the opportunity by proving to his supperior, Admiral Winslow (Torn), by commanding a ""relic"" submarine with a less than perfect crew in a war game. Along the way is Admiral Graham (Dern) who detests Dodge. Graham belives if he can beat Dodge, he will be in line for another star and outrank Winslow. Along the way, Dodge meets problems with his crew and Graham breathing down his neck.

But the lesser-known actors do an outstanding job as well. (Some great-looking guys are in this flick!

As a confirmed landlubber, I have no idea if the ""underwater"" scenes are real or not, but they work for me.

789044,5,6304107641,"I had been told that this screwball naval comedy included every submarine film cliche known to man, and noted that it had not been a particularly huge hit when it came out ten years ago. But as the hero was played by Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) I thought it would be worth picking up a pre-viewed copy to throw into my computer drive to enliven the last 90 minutes of a four-hour train journey.

In the event this film was vastly better than I had expected and the other passengers must have wondered what I was laughing at.

Grammer plays Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, a highly talented but utterly unconventional submarine officer whose sense of humour and far from by-the-book attitudes have placed him in grave danger of being passed over for command of his own boat. The film opens with a fierce debate at a promotion board,at which Rear Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern) who has taken a particular dislike to Dodge, argues that he is too maverick a personality to be trusted with command of a nuclear submarine.

But there is a compromise on offer. Graham's superior, Vice Admiral Winslow (Rip Torn) who is not quite so prejudiced against unconventional officers if they get the job done, has noticed that the former Soviet Union is selling off old diesel summarines in job lots to tin-pot unstable countries like Iran and Iraq. (Quite a prescient point given that this film was made five years before 9/11).

Admiral Winslow wants to test the possibility that the ultra-sophisticated high tech units deployed to defend the US coast against equally sophisticated attackers might make mistakes if faced with a much lower tech but crafty opponent - particularly if the enemy captain is highly unconventional or, in his words ""a pirate.""

So they give Dodge command of an ancient rustbucket of a diesel submarine called ""Stingray"" and invite him to see if he can get past all the much better equipped defenders of two key naval bases.

Admiral Winslow has a soft spot for Dodge, and gives him a green light to ignore the rules the way a real rogue attacker would; Admiral Graham is determined to humiliate him and does his best to make the Stingray's task ""Mission Impossible."" He starts by assigning Dodge a ""crew from hell"" of oddballs and misfits. These include a mad martinet, Martin Pascal (Rod Schneider) as his XO, and Lieutenant Emily Lake, (Lauren Holly), the first woman ever to serve as diving officer on a US submarine but who has no previous experience outside a simulator. Almost all of the crew have a combination of strengths and weaknesses - for example the sonarman, nicknamed ""Sonar"" (Harland Williams) has absurdly good hearing but is a very odd character and rather too prone to saying what he thinks. (Fortunately for the Stingray, Sonar's last captain got rid of him despite his enormous skill at the job because he thought Sonar was a security risk). Other members of the misfit crew are played by Harry Dean Stanton, Ken Hudson Campbell, Toby Huss, Duane Martin, Jonathan Penner, and Bradford Tatum, and they work together brilliantly - the cast obviously had a lot of fun making this.

Tom Dodge has to weld his peculiar crew into a team and take on an opposition which is determined not to give him an even break. He tries every trick that's not in the book to get past them ...

Apart from the crew of Stingray and the two admirals, one other performance of note in the film is given by William H Macy as Captain Knox of the USS Orlando, which was Tom Dodge's last sub before being given command of the Stingray. The Stingray keeps running into the Orlando and having to get past her on her way to the objectives of the exercise. Macy gives a brilliantly understated performance as a competent but unimaginative officer who has to display great reserves of self-control as he keeps falling foul of Dodge's maverick tricks. But you have to feel sympathy for Captain Knox as he holds on to his professionalism - something at which Admiral Graham is rather less successful ...

There are a fair number of things in this film which could only ever happen in Hollywood and not in real life, but although it is very funny and silly, you can suspend your disbelief most of the time.

I found this film laugh-out-loud funny and srongly recommend it.

P.S. Don't turn your DVD player off when the film ends and the credits start to roll - the end credits reel in which both the cast of the film and ""Village People"" spoof themselves and the original 1978 official music video for the latter's hit ""In the navy"" is one of the funniest parts of the movie. To the soundtrack of ""In the navy"" it shows a mix of some of the best clips from the film intermixed with the cast and ""Village People"" recreating an alternative version of the original music video for the song on board the Stingray.",1176249600,,4802,4.664302600472813

Known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub (an old rusty diesel boat) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern Navy. Fortunately Grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone.

The crew consists of stereotypes, from the flatulant cook, to the grizzled old veteran, to the spoiled son of an admiral, to the basketball star, to the spit-and-polish XO, but the actors manage to bring them off with charm, especially the electrician who Grammer notes has ""absorbed a lot of voltage"". In addition to the big laughs, there are the little scenes that bring a smile, such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to ""see if the other rooms are still tilted""

Ultimately it is a feel-good movie. It doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts, but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch!

Of special note, San Franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the ""mothball fleet"" in Suisun Bay and the docked sub shots of the ""Stingray"" are the USS Pampanito, a sub open for tours at Pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end.",1174262400,,1866,4.4

789228,4,6304107641,"DOWN PERISCOPE is one of those rare movies that is significantly better than first instinct.  Considering this was Kelsey Grammer's first starring movie, I was very curious (as a great fan of Frasier) but cautious.  No need to be.  Hugh Wilson's script was as good as we could have asked for, and Grammer pulled off one of his best acting experiences in his career...believable, intelligent, funny, and on the mark.  To stop the review here would not do justice, though.

Let's begin with the actors.  What an amazing cast!  First, you have Rip Torn, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, and William H. Macy...these are heavyweights in the acting world and boy do they come through.  Bruce Dern is especially good playing real jerks and this is no exception.  The remaining cast includes Lauren Hotty...er Holly, Rob Schneider (giving a solid, give-it-all-you-got performance), Ken Hudson Campbell, and Harland Williams (always funny...check out the movie ROCKETMAN if you love off-the-wall humor).

Then there's the sea-going action.  As a real fan of submarine movies (another reason I was cautious of this movie at first), I was blown away at the amount of attention to detail they gave to this part of the film.  Since it was a comedy, they could have just given scant attention to the action part of it and left it to dialogue to carry the movie.  But no!  They went all out and gave the viewer a wonderful action movie to boot (of course not Das Boot, the great submarine film...).  Anyway, the bottomline is that folks that like this genre won't be disappointed.

When you get a chance, watch this film.  As one that would like to buy a Special Edition DVD in widescreen of this movie, I know I will be disappointed since I doubt it will ever materialize.  Oh well...",1135987200,2,1769,4.7631578947368425

Being the daughter of the Navy, I watched for authenticity. Rob Schneider captured the nerves of an officer trying to get ahead under very trying curcumstances, with disastrous results for him!

Everyone gives their all in this ensemble performance. The close knit life below the surface comes across. My husband puts this in the player every time he comes home stressed out. Then he just relaxes and we laugh at the same scenes over and over.

Emily Lake, Diving Officer, was perfect casting. Her body language and facial expressions at certain times in the film were priceless. I sense a potential for other great comedies in her. Harland Williams as Seaman 2nd Class E.T. 'Sonar' Lovacelli is another standout. This is excellent visual comedy a la Radar of Mash. I was continually amazed by Rob Schneider doing the part of Executive Officer Martin T. 'Marty' Pascal. His boisterous, over-animated actions were well played. His whole body seemed to be in motion at every delivered line.

The plot was a plausible scenario and I never understood why some people disliked this film. The whole tongue in cheek attitude this film took toward the military has been used successfully in many other films and series like McHale's Navy without giving the impressions as a slam on the military. Respect and discipline was portrayed as an undertone even while the comedy raged.

789235,3,6304107641,"This movie has a good premise and an excellent cast, but if I had to name what exactly is wrong with it, I'd point to the the direction of David S. Ward. While it's competent, he makes the mistake of going for the cheap laugh with too many silly shots of the various crew members taking clownlike falls while mugging for the camera, which is unfortunate since the cast is full of very good and funny character actors that I've seen a lot funnier in other movies. Kelsey Grammar handles his role extremely well, stepping away from Frasier and jumping into the role of Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge like a tailor-made suit and letting the goofy side of the character shine with just the right amount of restraint to keep it from becoming clownish. It's really good to see him stretch a bit with this role, which is about as far from Frasier as I've ever seen him go. Grammer is an excellent actor (even though the only roles I'm familiar with him doing are Fraiser Crane, which he not only invented but absolutely owns, Sideshow Bob [which is sort of a Frasier variation], and this) and he does a great job with the role - he isn't happy with his assignment but does his best because of his sense of duty. He's wise enough to know how to handle the motley crew he's given and experienced enough to know how to fulfill his assignment. The cliches fly pretty thick, but Grammer keeps everything on an even keel. Rob Schneider, however... I'm going to assume it was Ward who instructed him to act as over-the-top as he does, but his constant screaming and calling the crew members ""retard"" gets old very fast. It's a workmanlike comedy and is satisfying on its own level. And, like I said, it's great to see Kelsey Grammer do something new.",1124582400,,1732,4.484177215189874

789276,4,6304107641,"In the World War II comedy Operation Petticoat, sub skipper Captain Matt Sherman (Cary Grant) had the challenge of trying to get the USS Sea Tiger, badly damaged alongside the dock in the Phillipines in a Japanese air raid, ready for sea with a paucity of spare parts, a misogynistic Chief Motor Machinist's Mate, a neurotic ship's yeoman, a ship's cook who is not only an escaped prisoner but also a Marine, and a green as grass lieutenant (jg) who is the biggest con man and scrounger in the Pacific Fleet. Once his boat is halfway seaworthy, Captain Sherman must successfully sail the crippled Sea Tiger to safety in Australia, with half a dozen Army nurses and a bunch of Filipino women and children as passengers, while both sides are hunting for him.  Quite a challenge.

His modern-day successor is Captain Thomas Dodge of the USS Stingray (Kelsey Grammer), who while not facing depth charges and strafing runs from an armed enemy, has equally daunting challenges of his own.

The premise of the comedy Down Priscope is a question actually raised in the 1990s by the United States Navy.  The Russians at the time were selling off Soviet-era diesel submarines to anyone who had the money to pay for them.  Most of the buyers were not and aren't friends of ours. The question the Navy needed to answer was, ""Could a diesel boat with a smart, resourceful, daring skipper and a dedicated crew penetrate American harbors and sink ships here - or maybe plant an atomic bomb?""  This was not (and still isn't) an idle question.  In real life, the Navy studied the matter and concluded no diesel-powered pigboat had a prayer of actually carrying out such a mission successfully.  The suggestion that the Navy buy or borrow a diesel sub and test the hypothesis was not followed through.

In David S. Ward's comedy, however, it is.

Lt. Commander Tom Dodge, executive officer of the USS Orlando, is between a rock and a hard place, career-wise.  He has a reputation in the submarine force as a maverick and unorthodox officer whose antics sometimes border on the foolhardy.  He has been recommended for command of his own nuclear attack sub twice before and not been selected for command.  If he's passed over again, it's '3 strikes and you're out.'  His captain, Carl Knox (well played by William H. Macy), has written a fitness report on Dodge that should see him moldering away behind a desk ashore until he retires.  Both are surprised when Dodge is ordered to take command of his own boat.

Vice Admiral Dean Winslow (Rip Torn, in a small but powerful performance), Commander of Submarines Atlantic Fleet, handpicks Dodge for a very special mission.  He is to recommission the USS Stingray, a late-World War II Balao-class diesel submarine last upgraded in 1958, and see whether the conventional wisdom of the Navy - that a diesel sub hasn't a prayer of sneaking into a U.S. harbor without getting caught - is correct.  He tells Dodge, ""Don't go by the book. Think like a pirate.""  Dodge still is reluctant to take the job, but he and COMSUBLANT set up a side bet.  Winslow gives Dodge two live Mark 37 torpedoes (obsolete by current standards but good fish in their day) and anchors a target ship outside Norfolk Harbor.  If Dodge can manage to sneak past the Navy ships trying to find him and sink the target ship, they'll talk about Dodge taking command of a nuclear sub.

Rear Admiral Yancey Graham (Bruce Dern) is commanding the defenders in the war game.  He is no fan of Tom Dodge's, has never lost a war game, and does everything he can to stack the deck in his own favor.  He assigns Captain Dodge a hand-picked crew.

The Stingray gets a psychotic executive officer; a retired diesel chief engineer recalled to active duty, who looks and acts like a beach bum - until the chips are down; the most insolent Motor Machinists Mate First Class you can imagine, a self-avowed pain in the neck who still has some growing up to do; a ship's electrician who is a walking example of why electroshock therapy has been outlawed; and a dive officer, Lt. Emily Lake (Lauren Holly), who is a test case to see if women can successfully serve in submarines - and while she's a qualified Surface Warfare Officer, she has absolutely no experience in submarines.

Dodge also gets an ace in the hole Graham probably never intended to give him: A sonarman with ears like a bat who speaks Humpback.  He's a weirdo, but a genius with the listening gear.  All things considered, the Stingray could do worse.

Dodge puts his boat back in commission and refits her, and then the games begin.  I'll not give away the details, but Tom Dodge has some moves worthy of Mush Morton, Red Ramage and Gene Fluckey. He isn't above stealing a couple of pages from Admiral Dan Gallery's books either as he faces off against his old skipper in the USS Orlando.  Things get interesting enough that Admiral Graham decides to get involved personally, putting his own service reputation and career advancement on the line.

Who will win in the end?  Watch the movie and find out. Be prepared to be entertained as the end credits roll by the Village People's rock video of their hit, ""In the Navy.""  That alone would make the DVD worth buying.  However, this movie entertains in and of itself.  Down Periscope belongs in the collection of anyone who likes submarine movies.

I strongly suspect that if Matt Sherman of the USS Sea Tiger and Tom Dodge of the USS Stingray ever got together over a couple of beers at the Officer's Club, they'd find a whole lot to talk about.  Down Periscope is a worthy successor to Operation Petticoat in the ship-based comedy genre, and we owe David S. Ward a vote of thanks for bringing it to us.",1119225600,11,5697,4.654345654345654

From the officer that learns to cope under fire, to the ne'er do well that comes of age, these are standard fare executed to perfection.  Often overlooked is the brilliant 2nd unit work of subs leaving the harbor or tankers infiltrating a convoy.

As good is the music score, which from the opening scenes is spot on perfect  - a  clinic in how to score a film ( a good reason to get a home theater set up if you don't already have it).

I'll just add that the best comedic moments, like the ""whale sounds"" scene, are classics of  non-verbal comedy.

789280,4,6304107641,"Considering that Down Periscope is a comedy, they get more things right than a lot of ""serious"" movies. Okay, this isn't a movie you'd want to watch if you wanted to know exactly how things were done on a diesel sub. Things are moved around to accommodate camera placement, and the crew is mostly too young. If the Navy ever did something like, you'd expect a lot of middle-aged reservists, guys old enough to have some actual experience with diesel boats. (And not just one potty old engineering officer, either.) The torpedoes are wrong, too. You can't fire a Mark-48 from a Balao's tubes.

But that's not the point. This is good, sophomoric fun, humor for humor's sake. It's not a movie that requires you to think that much. You might be better of if you didn't, and just sat back and enjoyed it. You might even learn something useful. As a Marine officer pointed out in a Naval Institute Proceedings article, Down Periscope may be a comedy, but Kelsey Grammer's Tom Dodge also represents a pretty good example of applied leadership skills.

Oh, and despite what some reviewers have suggested, the wide screen DVD isn't the ""pan and scan"" full screen version with the top and bottom of the screen cut off. It's just the opposite, in fact. The full screen version includes image area at the top and bottom of the screen that was never really intended to be shown. (Like the top of Dodge's golfing pants before the gag is revealed.) Most wide screen movies with heavy CGI effects are shot ""flat"" today, instead of with anamorphic lenses, and mask the unwanted image area in printing.",1094083200,20,1584,4.673835125448028

Lt. Cmdr. Thomas 'Tom' Dodge (Kelsey Grammer) is an officer attached to the U.S.S. Orlando, a fast attack nuclear submarine operating out of norfolk.  He is up for promotion and his own submarine command, but due to his past history, including an incident where, intoxicated, he got a tattoo on his private parts, he has incurred the enmity of one member of the board, RADM Yancey Graham (Bruce Dern), who opposes his promotion.

Dodge is given a command, but of an old WWII biesel rustbucket,

the U.S.S. Stingray, and ordered to take part in an exercise pitted against the nuclear navy, to see if an old diesel sub, in the wrong hands, could get by our modern defenses and sink a target vessel in Norfolk harnor.  The exercise is to be under the supervision of RADM Graham, and Dodge's crew is composed of misfits and a spy (his own executive officer).  His dive officer turns out to be a female, and a rebellious crewman is a vice-admiral's son.

That is the plot and the conflict.  This is a hilarious movie.

789282,5,6304107641,Down Periscope is hilarious from beginning to end. It is one of those movies that has a serious plot invaded by superb humor. I laughed almost every couple of minutes while watching this movie. Down Periscope is one humorous movie that anyone can pretty much agree on. What is amazing to me is that this movie did not do well at the box office. I definately think it was good enough to spawn a sequel.,1089504000,4,401,4.36
789283,5,6304107641,"I really hope the last reviewer comes back to see what else has been said. This is one of my favorite movies and I was a bit dissapointed that I wasn't going to be upgrading my poor, overwatched VHS tape that is hanging on by a thread, for a full Widescreen DVD with all the bells & whistles. I got the DVD anyway and noticed that one side is printed with ""Side A Full Screen"" while the other side is blank...cusriosity got the best of me and I figured that if it has  ""Side A"" there must be a reason...so I put the DVD in on the other side...and the movie is there...AND IN WIDESCREEN! Apparently they forgot to print the label for side B, but it most certainly exists :)",1082678400,8,672,4.129770992366412

Nope.
They did not put out the orignal print.  This is the pan-and-scan version with the top and bottom of the screen chopped off.  Its very apparent in several parts of the movie.  I ran my VHS on one TV and the DVD on the home theater...its the same width of screen.
I was also not impressed with the 5.1 surround.  Not nearly enough seperation and use of the back speakers, or subwoofer!!  Buckman's fart should have come booming out of my subfoofer...Nada.
At least the colors and quality of print on the pan-and-scan side are better than my VHS copy.

789347,3,6304107641,"If you're reading this, you likely already know how much fun this movie is.  One of the few I'll watch many times.  But the DVD job here is mediocre at best.  Like one other said, faked widescreen, ok audio, no specials.  But if you don't mind having a fullscreen (and good) copy on DVD with fair audio, that you won't wear out (easily), hear you go!
Shame on 20th Century Fox for such a shabby effort, knowing full well they'll use the funds from this to pay for the real enhanced release in a few months no doubt.  They know we'll still buy it.  But now we know to rent from them first, then wait for the enhanced editions.  Me?  Couldn't wait....this movies too good.",1076544000,10,670,4.304
789348,3,6304107641,"Kelsey Grammer is Tom Dodge, the sit-com producer's idea of nuclear submarine commander.  Passed over for promotion repeatedly in the past, he has languished as the executive officer of other-people's subs.  When he is passed over again, a sympathetic admiral (Rip Torn) comes up with an idea to save Dodge's career while enhancing his own pet project.  Dumbfounded that he is now to get command of his own boat (Dodge's then-superior is a bit dumbfounded himself, and decodes Dodge's promotion papers twice) he is shocked to find that his new command is actually a mothballed and rust-coated WWII relic.  The diesel-powered USS Stingray looks like a fossil from the days of the Monitor and the Merrimack, but it's the ""perfect"" sample target for a nuclear navy in the post-Soviet years.  (US submariners had spent much of their career training to find and fight other nuclear subs rather than the non-nuclear boats which actually comprise the majority of the world's submarine fleets; diesel-electric subs lack the extensive pumping systems used in nuclear plants, which makes them inherently quieter and harder to track.  They are also cheaper to operate and acquire which, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, makes them possible tools for terrorists).
Getting little support from the higher-ups for his end of Rip Torn's wargames, Dodge culls together a rogue-crew: a compulsively angry XO (Rob Schneider), a demented chief engineer (Harry Dean Stanton), a less-than stellar diving officer (Lauren Holly - who also becomes the subject of the misfit crew's many pranks) and various other second-string sailors.  As the Stingray takes to the sea, it finds itself the quarry of the modern nuclear navy, barely keeping itself undetected (quick action saves the day).  As Stingray succeeds, another admiral (played by Bruce Dern) decides to take command of the entire operation, less obsessed with Dodge's cranky sub than Dodge himself.
""Down"" is a fun though not hysterical flick.  Kelsey Grammer is actually quite good (I've never caught his show) as a sub driver, and watching it you begin to wonder how much better the flick could have been if it wasn't just played for laughs - a sort of advfenture movie that was also funny (the flick is actually light on the laughs as it is).  A bunch of ex-sub drivers could have gotten together to craft a story that didn't need to be an extended episode of ""McHale's Navy"".  Though hardly the most realistic submarine movie ever made, the plot dealing with nuts-and-bolts of submarine life were actually more fun than the jokes.  It's diverting fun, but like a sub, it slips past you once you've finished it.",1076198400,3,2653,5.018223234624146
789349,3,6304107641,"I love this movie.  I've seen it 20 times on tape at least.  So when the DVD arrived this morning I couldn't wait to put it in the player.  But wait, as the widescreen version (both are allegedly included on the DVD) played, it didn't look right to me.  I started flipping between the widescreen and standard versions, and it confirmed my worst fears: THE STUDIO CARVED THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OUT OF THE STANDARD VERSION!  I have never seen this done before on DVD.  You will see the tops of everybody's heads cut off in the opening scenes.  Later in the movie when captain Kelsey Grammar accuses dive officer Lauren Holly of being ""almost out of uniform,"" the joke is completely ruined by the cropped view of Holly's uniform.  This magnifying of the screen lowers the contrast and makes it look grainy.  Did the studio think we wouldn't notice?  I think this really shows contempt for us, the customers.  When I buy a widescreen DVD, I expect to see what I saw in the theater!  But here, you'll see more by watching the standard version.  This is inexcusable.
The audio is presented in 5.1, which adds a great deal to this movie.  However, better use could have been made of the surround speakers; the background is not well separated.
Now the movie:  Kelsey Grammar is a ""think outside the box"" naval officer given command of the Stingray, a World War II Vallejo class Diesel sub.  His assignment is to try to outwit the nuclear navy and run a blockade.  To sabotage his efforts, Admiral Bruce Dern gives him the worst crew he can find including diving officer Holly, sonar man Harlan Williams, and an electrician who's taken ""a lot of volts.""  Down Periscope was sunk by the critics when it came out--Roger Ebert put it on his worst of the year list.  The humor is sophomoric and silly, and therein lies the charm of this movie.  It has a good heart.  Grammer is perfect as a goofball captain who is really very, very good at his job.  This is kind of movie that will either work on you or it won't.  If you like silly movies, give Down Periscope a shot.  As for the butchering of the widescreen version of this movie on the DVD, let's hope this doesn't start a trend.",1076112000,14,2171,4.479591836734694
789350,5,6304107641,"An outstanding outing for Kelsey Grammer and a cute tease on Navy brass. Why it took so long to get this to DVD one can only guess.

When I had run out of New Releases with which to bore myself at <insert favorite video rental biz here>, I went looking for something off the wall (or shelves as it were). I was surprised to find a video that I had heard nothing about, but that had well-known actors like Kelsey Grammer, Rob Schneider and Lauren Holly. I picked it up with hopes that it wouldn't be too bad.
I was pleasantly surprised by the character development and storyline. Although this is one that I watched alone (loser), it was still hella funny.
The casting was terrific. They put experienced, but not-so-well-known, actors in with the others previously mentioned to really bring in the supporting roles. The ship's chef, Seaman Buckman, was played by Ken Campbell (known for his part as ""Animal"" on the short-lived early-90's sitcom Herman's Head) and then, of course, Harland Williams as ""Sonar"".
Rent this one or pre-order it. It's not stupid or dry comedy; it's great jokes performed very well. Lauren Holly can be my Diving Officer any day. ;)",1071100800,5,1088,4.701570680628272

A great comedy where the action and humor never slows down. The dialog, situations, practical jokes and physical humor are very good throughout. The only negative comment I could make is that it ended way too soon.

Kelsey Grammer is especially awesome as the laid-back captain of an archaic submarine who foils the entire U.S. navy in an attempt to get a better boat.
The laughs are almost non-stop. Sometimes it's blatant, and sometimes, oh so subtle. Grammer's timing is impeccable. This movie deserved far more accolades than it got in its original release.

This was a fantastic film.  No!  It did not have huge success at the box office.  No!  It does not have superstar caliber actors.  What it does have is great writing, great characters, and the kind of ""off-the-wall"" humor that makes you say, ""I can't believe they just said that!"".
