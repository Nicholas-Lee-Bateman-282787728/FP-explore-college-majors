2674938,5,B000JJSRMA,This version is one of the best orfeos i've ever seen. The scenery and vestuary are gorgeous and the singers are fabulous. Fernando Arauza is marvelous.,1212019200,,152,4.884615384615385
2674939,4,B000JJSRMA,"I also own the performance staged at the Liceu de Barcelona, and was able to compare it to Harnoncourt's version. What I like more about this last one (Harnoncourt) is the quality of the singers and that they are better actors, especially in the dramatic moments. The staging is impressive, although I like the Barcelona one better because it makes me feel that this is the way it was represented for the first time, during Monteverdi's life.",1176768000,,442,4.753246753246753
2674940,5,B000JJSRMA,"The long-awaiting DVD of this production is out, and it is fabulous. As one could expect from DGG, the sound and visuals are first-rate. If you have to choose only one recording of this great opera, this is the one to get (I have them all, I think). The costumes are sets are terrific and authentic- probably better than authentic. One gets the feeling that one is there, along with the Duke and Duchess. Amazing playing, especially considering how early in the ""early music revival"" period this was made.

The box set with the other two extant Monteverdi operas is a good deal, as well, as they are also excellent. The work is timeless, fun, and profound. See this, in this version, and you'll be a fan for life.",1175644800,,713,4.5271317829457365
2674941,5,B000JJSRMA,"Monteverdi's L'Orfeo was first performed in 1607, which makes it one of the first operas ever written.

Staging such an antique work is a challenge, since the social environment in which it was first performed has long vanished, and our knowledge of it is imperfect, at best.

There are many temptations for a director of such a piece, including 'modern dress', high camp, or worst of all, he could treat it as a contemporary opera.

Fortunately, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle has fallen into none of these traps - he stages, in front of a modern audience, a formal masque-like performance, and transforms the chorus into the 17th century audience - a very clever trick which allows them to perform in the opera but also to react to its contents.

Singing styles are unorthodox, but I suspect authentic for the period.

And here's the strange thing - the music is remarkably modern, with none of the stilted rhythms of some later composers.

This is a superb production. Up until now, only available if you could find a second-hand VHS recording.

This review is based on viewing just such a recording, from my local library. I look forward to seeing and hearing it on DVD.",1171324800,,1164,4.7611940298507465

8151392,3,B000JJSRMA,"I teach high school music history to non-music students.  We were studying early Baroque Operas specifically arias and recititives and I felt that my students needed to be able to put the music into context of what the libretto of the opera was and I felt that showing them the opera would better relate the music and sceneray of what an opera is.  It was interesting how the students received the opera, the concept of viewing it from the perspective of an audience member.  The costumes were a little ""cheesy"" however, it is based on mythology.",1368403200,,546,4.666666666666667
8151393,5,B000JJSRMA,"A fine recreation of what a baroque production might have been like. Enthusiastic cast, well sung with lively accompanent. Nothing at all to dislike and plenty to like.",1361923200,,168,5.035714285714286
8151394,4,B000JJSRMA,"I like half of this piece (2/3?), that is, before the descent of Orfeo into Hell.
The first part is lusciously produced and beautifully performed. I tend to agree that Huttenlocher is not a perfect Orfeo, mostly in his acting, not his singing. He is a tad to stolid, but in the first half when Orfeo was in a celebrating mood, he interacts well with the others - the shephards, the nymphs, and delivers a lively performance of Orfeo the bridegroom.
Turban is simply stunning - this Eurydice is also sung by her, an amateur soprano who sings well enough for the small singing part in this work.
Together with Ponnelle's great artwork, the first part of this piece is simply mind blowingly stunning.
Things get a bit sticky when Orfeo descends to the Underworld. Huttenlocher becomes more ungainly both vocally and dramatically, probably owing to the rather odd settings (as seen 'now') of this Underworld. It is hardly great theatrically to have living persons dressing up as skeletons to represent the dead (or the 'Spirits'). Especially that this is a film, more special effects could surely have been employed?
Not being a specialist in baroque period instruments, I have little problem with good old Harnoncourt's band, bearing in mind that his 'band' grew up with me and my ears.",1357776000,,1283,4.836363636363636
8151395,5,B000JJSRMA,"This made-for-TV film of ""Orfeo,"" directed and designed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, was based on a 1975 production for the Zurich Opera House.  It runs for 101 minutes, and Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Monteverdi Ensemble of the Zurich Opera House perform with lustrous authenticity.  Occasionally one of the musicians (most especially the lutenist) climbs up on stage to accompany a particular singer.

Swiss bass-baritone, Philippe Huttenlocher who is this production's Orfeo began his career as a violinist--how appropriate is that for a singer who is portraying the world's greatest musician?  Opera's first hero is given the gift of song by Apollo, and after he loses Euridice a second time and is torn apart by the Bacchantes, the god awards Orfeo a place in heaven.

German actress, Dietlinde Turban (wife of conductor Lorin Maazel)  plays the role of Euridice.  She does very little singing (actually, I wonder whether someone else did a voice-over of her part), but she is (if you'll pardon the expression) drop-dead gorgeous, which makes it easy to understand why Orfeo ventured down into Hades to bring her back to life.

My favorite voice in this production belongs to the late German bass, Hans Franzen who sings Charon (Caronte).  He is one of those rare basses who does not lose volume as he sinks deep into his lower register.  Indeed, his voice seems to emanate from the bottomless pit of Hades as he rows the dead across the Styx.  These are the most haunting scenes in the opera, as Charon transports warriors, children, ladies of easy virtue, and church prelates to their afterlife, while Orfeo begs to accompany him.

I own several videos of Ponnelle's productions, but ""Orfeo"" is visually the most beautiful:  a haunting journey from the flowery pastures of Thrace to the cobwebbed, skeletonized domain of Pluto (Plutone), and finally to the ultimate duet in which Orfeo and Apollo rise, singing into heaven.

8151397,1,B000JJSRMA,"I am probably not a fair reviewer of this opera. I purchased it because I like Ponnelle productions. I find these earlier operas horribly boring, the music unmoving and orchestration annoying (strumming a harp for instance). In my opinion there is only one memorable aria but you can get this on opera highlight CDs. The story is incomprehensible and would appeal to the intelligentsia of opera.",1308873600,,395,5.0
8151398,5,B000JJSRMA,"This is the first performance out of total of three there were created by Ponnelle and Harnoncourt in the late 1970s for Zurich Opera House.  I personally watched Il Coronazione di Poppea first and was so amazed by that performance that I knew I had to see everything that this artistic team has done.  When watching the Poppea, I understood after the fact what our Boston Early Music Festival production of Poppea in June 2008 was after - and they were partially successful, but Harnoncourt and Ponnelle reign supreme up to this day.

L'Orfeo is simply superb and without equal today; the attention to every detail - musical and visual - is unparalleled; I loved how the staging visually separates mythological personagges, as Apollo and La Musica, and then Orfeo and Euridice, dressing them in black and grey chiaroscuro palette, from real life people like peasants, who are all in colorful clothes.  The acting is amazing, even the male vs female chorus act in such a believable fashion that one can imagine herself watching some noble court of Renaissance Italy.

There was such deep symbolism in staging again; Orfeo and Euridice were quite motionless, she is in pure white dress which can be as a bridal gown but as a shroud, too.  The choice of a young and beautiful woman was so excellent - she looked as Botticelli's Primavera, underscoring the tragedy of her untimely end and Orfeo's loss.  What is amazing that the whole performance is seen as perfectly natural, without extravagance or excessive pretense that often punctuates modern productions; perhaps it is most appealing to those who appreciate Renaissance art and shun overly bold and often vulgar modern ways of staging; it was interesting to read the booklet where the idea of doing this in jeans was discarded from the start - something that is so widely embraced now that doing Handel or Purcell in jeans is no more shocking but rather common and banal.

As always with Venetian opera of that time, it is not without witty humor, and the singing skeleton was quite funny.

Singing is excellent, and the whole musicality is fantastic; overall, we are lucky to have this masterpiece preserved on DVD; it is a must for all Monteverdi and Baroque music lovers - it truly sets a standard.",1269216000,,2255,4.836363636363636
8151399,5,B000JJSRMA,"This is a tightly controlled and deeply felt performance. All pieces are in careful balance: the music, the staging, and the acting. Musically, Nikolaus Harnoncourt's dramatic precision is unsurpassed. It sounds gorgeous, but Harnoncurt is not after beautiful sound. It is always the music's emotional substance that anchors and propels his performances, and this is the root of his communicative power here too.

Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stage is likewise richly textured. It creates a dreamy, mythical world: at once glittering and shadowy, fragile and monumental, vaguely familiar and eerily distant. So captivating is the staging that the only weak points of this filmed version are the sudden close-ups and unusual camera-angles that depart from what you would see in the theatre. With the exception of the shots of Harnoncourt and the orchestra, which do add emotional force, such embellishments appear as attempts to improve upon perfection.

The singers are excellent. It feels unfair to single out anyone, but Trudeliese Schmidt in the double role of La Musica/Speranza is particularly charismatic. Philippe Huttenlocher is an earthy, masculine Orpheus--attractive and flawed. To me, Ian Bostridge on the audio-recording with Emmanuelle Haim is the most seductive Orpheus with a self-consciously demigodly presence. Huttenlocher's is a handsome young man--earnest, inexperienced, overconfident. A very human portrayal.",1249862400,,1425,5.780952380952381
8151400,3,B000JJSRMA,"When it was staged in 1975, Harnoncourt & Ponelle's production of Monteverdi's 1607 opera L'Orfeo was a revolutionary triumph of the ""Early Music"" movement, the harbinger of massive changes in the whole environment of classical music that have blessedly occurred since. I wasn't there for opening night, but I heard of the event and applauded vigorously. Nikolaus Harnoncourt has the stature of an Apostle in my musical pantheon. That said, it's painful to confess that I find the current re-released film of that production extremely hard to watch and hear. In comparison to the musically sublime performance by Tragicomedia, also on DVD, this costume-heavy staging seems melodramatic, busy, and incoherent in affect. The orchestra is raggedy in tuning and balance. The singing is uneven. The cinematographic is obtrusive. Judged by current standards, it's a three-star costly failure, and that's how I've reluctantly rated it.

First, the orchestra. Do I have to point out that the Baroque trumpets, cornetti, and recorders are not played at a standard comparable to normal orchestral instruments? That accusation was thrust in our faces - we who worked hard on resuscitating those instruments - often enough to make it painful to acknowledge that it was true. but even in 1975, there were recorderists and cornettists who could have given better accounts of their instruments than those in Harnoncourt's 'Monteverdi-Ensemble'. All the winds are prominent, and prominently out -of-tune. The rest of the orchestra sounds semi-pro at best by the standards of historical playing in 2008.

Then, the chorus. Huh? All those grandees in the balcony, singing lustily like aspirants to the Robert Shaw Chorale?  L'Orfeo was essentially a chamber work, performed in a sala in Mantua, an expansion really of the madrigal form and intrinsically INTIMATE! It doesn't work well musically to treat it as halfway to Wagner.

And the soloists. Honestly, the shepherds steal the show. Those tenors have beautiful Italianate voices, and have at least teh rudiments of 'historically informed' vocal technique. The shepherds' duets are some of the most elegant music in L'Orfeo; the ensemble isn't exactly tight, but the sound is pleasurable. Mantuans, I assure you, were keen on pleasure.  Trudeliese Schmidt is tuneful, if not expressive, as La Musica and La Speranza. Basso Hans Franzen is plenty profundo as Charonte, despite his over-the-top costume. The most serious problem is Orfeo, sung by Philippe Huttenlocher. Orfeo sings roughly half the music of the opera, and his emotions are what the whole thing is about. Huttenlocher first portrays Orfeo as a kind of jolly lout, straight from Die Meistersinger. He hams and grimaces distractingly. His voice is adequate and he has the notes, but he makes the trills and other embellishments sound dreadfully labored. Later, in Hades, he cranks up the embellishments way past his ability to  sing them beautifully; it's the beauty of his singing that's supposed to drive the plot, after all.

Furthermore, the staging. Busy, busy, busy! So much going on in the background. So many visual distractions. How could Ponelle have imagined that people could concentrate on the music? And all the busy-ness is compounded to the Nth by the cinematography, which is as jumpy as a Police Academy film on TV with commercials. Camerawork on steroids! L'Orfeo is a tragedy, a work of ""gravitas"" and elegance, not a piece of Renaissance Faire burlesque.

Last, the interpretation. Is there one? Harnoncourt was certainly exploring the possibilities, and he can't be totally scorned for making some inchoate choices. The entrance of the Nymph who announces Eurydice's death, for instance, and the laments of the shepherds in both acts are musical catastrophes, blaring overstatements. Why, by the way, is that Nymph dressed as Sarah Palin without her glasses? She was Eurydice's bosom friend and companion, not a witch! The key word for any interpretation of Monteverdi and his contemporaries is AFFECT, and Harnoncourt never settles on a plausible, consistent affect for the music.

The bottom line is that this performance is outdated.",1225584000,,4156,5.275340393343419
