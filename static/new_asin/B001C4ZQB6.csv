8285929,5,B001C4ZQB6,The DVD played wonderfully! It was nicely sealed and contained a Shuffle! poster on the inside.,1408492800,,95,5.0
8285930,3,B001C4ZQB6,"The Series started off on a light goofy touch. A bit of anime nudity that probably could have been skipped to make the series more tasteful and still just as sexy. Then the tone changes when a terrible event occurs to Remu. From there you start learning indepth about each of the girls personalities and the skeletons they keep in their closet. Some have very light secrets, and some very grim.

 The Anime takes a turn for the shallow goofy episodes and begins to reveal a much deeper and serious story. Voice actor Carrie Savage does an amazing job as ""Kaede"" and really brings out the darker side of the character.

 In Vol. 6 Rin is still faced with the consequences of his decisions. He has to watch the hearts he led on be broken. Interestingly enough both Narine and Lisianthus are at peace with Rin's decision since their feelings were settled on in earlier episodes, but it's Kaede that we get to learn of this time. Once Rin finally breaks out the truth Kaede has to find peace within herself. Ironically it's Primula that helps Kaede get back on her feet and headed in the right direction.

 Vol. 6 also focuses heavily on Rin's relationship with Asa. We no longer get to see them as the shy boy and girl not admitting their feelings, but now a real couple. This ending series really test the limits of their love. Now this is where the story really falls apart. Asa is a Side character in the story.

  The first few disc focus on Rin and all the other girls but Asa. There's only a breif episode on Asa, but she is mainly a backseat character. Then all of a sudden the chairs are flipped and all the main characters take a back seat and Asa is miraculously infront. Honestly as good as the series was getting this really ruined it. Rin out of now where is passionatly in love with Asa, but we never get to see their relationship develop to that point. Sure, they have a back story, but we don't see it.

  It's hard to understand why this character was a better pick, because the veiwer never gets a chance to see the characters develop together. From the way the series was leading with the abundance of pro-Sia episodes it was expected Rin would chose her, but out of now where he choses a random ""filler"" character. For me it really broke the story and made the chosen romance feel out of place. Ideally Sia would be the ideal character, because we get to see relationship development with her in the anime. However, Shuffle! ruins its story line with the turn of events. Overall I thought the Anime was great, the art was fantastic, the characters where interesting, but I felt as though the decision Rin made strayed away from the direction of the anime. It was unexpected, and didn't seem to fit with the direction of the show. However I still reccomend this Anime it was nice, but again you may or may not be satisfied with the turn of events.",1236470400,,2863,4.442748091603053
8285931,5,B001C4ZQB6,"First I want to say I'm going to miss this series, while by no stretch is this the greatest anime series of all time. It became my favorite anime series this year. Trust me it didn't start that way, but the characters grew on me. As far as the ending goes I found it satisfactory they gave you happy ending which I felt was nice. I still can't believe how dark this series got. I loved the turn but it was so happy go lucky, then boom Rumu got sick it all went down hill. Some of those episodes you can really feel what the characters are going through. I feel the Japanese are brilliant when it comes to make you care about cartoon characters. Now the million dollar question what girl would I choose. It took me a minute to figure which one I was feeling the most. But I have to pick Lisianthus AKA Sia. She was to me the sexiest espicially Kikyo. She was like hot sex on a platter in that phase lol. I have to give a special shout out to Maiyumi I thought she was really cute. Yeah she had a lack of boobs but I just liked her. But, I can see why Rin picked Asa she had the most laid back personality. If she looked like Maiyumi she would have been my first pick.

I'm going to take this show in the real world for a moment. When Rin made his choice and it was all said and done. All girls still liked him and still want him the same. Nothing changed. There like yeah your dating Asa and thats cool, but if you want to come over here and get some you can have it. In real life no matter how much Asa may ""like"" those girls she would be ready to beat one of them down if they didn't step off. But Rin never had a spine so you know he wouldn't say respect my relationship and back off. Its just a thought I had. Oh and lastly for all the pervs out there when the credits role there is a part when Kaide falls on Sia and they kiss, by accident I guess. Anyway to wrap this up I enjoyed this series alot I would recement it but since this is the last disk, start from the beggining. Later",1222128000,,1987,3.9675
8285932,5,B001C4ZQB6,"That pretty much sums up this disk.  After the events of disk 5, Kaede hides in her room, Asa is home from the hospital, and the other girls (Sia, Rina, and Remu) are trying to make heads or tails of Rins' choice.  Rin finally tells the other girls about his decision to move out and the past that he had with Kaede, they start to understand his choices.  Also during a rainy day, a chance meeting of Asa and Kaede finally brings out Kaede feelings for Rin and though she knows he does not love her like that, she wants to love him due to her actions from the past.  Then Rin finds an apartment, but then Asa collapses again.  The second episode has Asa's mother explain to Rin her past and the REAL reason why Asa was always sickly (let us just point to Episode 2 and the Episode about Project Yydgrasill for hints).  And also explains why Asa does not want magic used on her.  The third episode show what Rin will do to get a VERY stubborn Asa to use a special ability she has in order to save both of them.  The final episode has Remu starting off to school with the others, and as the King of Demons says, he chose a girlfriend, not a bride so the contest is back on for Rin's heart, with all 6 girls (Asa, Rina, Kaede, Remu, Sia, and Kykio (yes she is still popping up)) going to go all out to win that coveted spot (though I like the fact that the Realm of the Gods  allows a man to have MANY wives).

the series was great, and the way it ended could bring a second season if the creators wanted to.  from light, to dark, to light again makes it w must have for anime collectors",1221177600,,1584,4.093851132686084
