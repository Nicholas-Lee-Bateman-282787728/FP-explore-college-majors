8547405,3,B00A7046HG,"Ghost Photos was a lightweight film in the J-Horror Department, but it still manages to tell a decent  story in the end.

In the film, Toshi, a high school student, and her brother, Kazu, come across an old camera while going through their grandfather's things after he dies. Kazu becomes intrigued by the camera and takes a picture of his sister in front of their house as a memory. Later, however, he notices the image of a strange woman in the attic standing behind Toshi, as if she's looking down on them from above. Neither Toshi or Kazu can explain the anomaly. However, another strange event occurs when Toshi comes across a photo of a forest that she believes her grandfather took before he died. She can't quite place the forest, but she believes she's been there before. In the picture, however, another faint image of a woman can be seen in the background behind a tree.  Yoshi and Kazu become creeped out by the whole thing and decide to get rid of the camera, but it's a job easier said than done. Additionally, Toshi keeps getting the strange forest photo sent to her on a new cell phone which her mother buys for her. At first she believes her brother is the one sending the photo to her as a sick joke. But he claims he's not the one doing it.

As the movie progresses, we also find out about a series of kidnappings in the communities' past, where young children disappear, but are never found again. In fact, Toshi's mother is concerned for Toshi's safety most of the time and continually pressures her to return home right away after school, even when Toshi meets up with a ""friend"" sometimes to hang out. Meanwhile Kazu lives separately with his father since his mother and father are having a hard time getting along. Toshi's mother wants Toshi to do well on a university placement exam, while she feels her husband is too laid back with his job as a teacher in a small town community.  She finds it to be a bad example for Toshi. As a result, Kazu and Toshi are limited to either talking on the phone or texting each other most of the time.

Creepy events continue to occur however, and they push the family further into tragedy, as the two teens try to deal with the unknowns of the ghost photos.  Eventually the film comes to an end tying the photos, the kidnappings, Toshi's friend and the families' relationship together, I won't it spoil for you.

 I liked this film overall. It had a slight mystery to it, although I'd have to say, I wasn't totally surprised when I found out who the person in the photo was. The film kind of made that obvious and I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was easy to figure out none the less. However, the movie does make up for that flaw by adding a whole new twist near the end, which I thought helped redeem the film overall. It wasn't a total clich&eacute; with a predictable ending.

The tension between the teen's parents was a good back story and actually adds to the film. Their mother did a good job of playing the cold parent who wants what's best for her daughter at any cost. Toshi's success on the entrance exams seems to be the key ingredient for the families' dysfunctional situation and it's primarily forced by her mother.

I also like how Japanese ghost films don't always have a happy ending. In their culture, ghosts don't  want assistance from the living. They just seem to be attached to people for various reasons. And in this case, it seems to be the people, not the things, such as the camera, that is driving the haunting. The film is told through Toshi's perspective most of the time, so the haunting is centered around her. Although her family is affected by it also.

I only gave the film three stars because it wasn't full of big scares like some J-Horror films. It was more interesting to me in an X-Files sort of way. The loss of a second star is for the subtitles, which weren't always translated correctly. For example stuffs was used instead of the word things once. Mistakes like that occurred throughout the film.  It was only a minor inconvenience though. I could easily follow the film without confusion.

Three cheers to Asian Crush for adding Ghost Photos to the J-Horror genre in the English speaking market. It's worth a watch if you like ghost stories, J-Horror, or cute lead actress' in general like Toshi.",1373328000,7,4322,4.508951406649617
