8341058,4,B001TCL1G0,I a fan of Kwon Sang woo and Sung Seung heon. They are both great korean actors. They movie has a lot of action. The only think I didn't like is the quality of the dvd company looks very cheap.,1360281600,,193,3.85
8341059,3,B001TCL1G0,Action packed but the storyline is disjointed.  Producers trying to make several storyline fit into one and flow of the movie felt awkward.,1340150400,,139,5.043478260869565
8341060,3,B001TCL1G0,"Great A-Listed Korean Actors, but after a few minutes into the movie, I already knew how it was going to end.  Rate it as an average!",1307923200,,133,4.115384615384615
8341061,4,B001TCL1G0,"This is Korean in all respects. There is boundless violence,drinking,blood,betrayal,hopelessness,cruelty,disfuntional everything and not a single cop in sight. Four friends from high school remain together as a gang and attempt to rob a casino owned by their underworld boss only to get caught. To save the lives of his buddies,the hero volunteers to serve time in prison. One of the gang betrays the rest by keeping a bag of money that was hidden from the rest. Another member is crippled and the last,a serious jerk with ""short person's disease"" turns into a junkie. After the hero's release he attempts to opt out of the underworl life-style but it doesn't work out as he tries to solve the individual problems of his former gang. Back-stabbing,front-stabbing and being bitched out by his loser of a mother are added color. This is a sad movie who's ending you are not likely to like, but, this is a Korean movie and in the style we have come to expect and like. Well-directed,filmed and played. The price is right and the quality of DVD is very good. Recommended. 3 1/2 to 4 stars.",1304640000,3,1085,4.776595744680851
