8460969,4,B0057O6INC,"Great stylish film noir, and rare non erotic movie from maestro Tinto Brass, ""Snack Bar Budapest"" made in 1988, stands along closer to the earlier works of the aggressively ""against tabu"" director, who's well known for ""Caligula"" (1980) but has made poignant, excellent films such as ""Drop Out"", ""La Vacanza"", ""Salon Kitty"" and also ""The Key"" which might be erotica, but it is for sure widely considered a masterpiece of the genre and not just limited to it. This movie which was marketed by Medusa at the time with a strong publicity campaign that was mistakenly pushing on sex, it is actually a dark, desperate, crime drama adapted for the screen from a book of Marco Bre and Silvia Lodoli, set in an imprecise place and time, in a deserted, wintry summer resort which is actually splendidly photographed with authentic darkness and beauty by Alessio Gelsini, and, showcases the lives of a bunch of disillusioned misfits: a boozing attorney (Giancarlo Giannini delivers great work), his pregnant, unhappy girlfriend with a past (beautiful femme fatale, Raffaella Baracchi), and their abrupt friend Lapo (Philppe Leotard). They have the bad faith to get acquainted to a young (adolescent) gangster (Francois Negret from Academy Award winner's Louis Malle's ""Au Revoir les enfants"") who seems to quite foolishly terrify the whole riviera with a gang just made by young hooligans and prostitutes. While the lawyer tries desperately to get a break, also to assist Milena (his girl), complications will arise ill fated, and, unfortunately intersecting the faith of the leads in a vortex of love and death.
This utterly melancholic, extremely well directed, and staged, acted, and produced (by Giovanni Bertolucci) movie, it is a rather phantasmagorical, dreamy neo noir of unique effect, and incredibly restrained technical style and editing, and, while it presents an array of gruesome sequences, and, horrifying murders, cruel, and rabid sentiments, perhaps, it does fail in delivering the promised and usual warm sensuality that normally defines the work of the maestro, but nonetheless,  it does indeed present Brass as an author of great and diverse strength, gifted with cinematic bravura, capable of telling a story with deadly and pessimistic tones,  with the same intensity and effective and visionary filmmaking used in way different atmospheres, and, in more financially successful movies.",1453161600,,2397,5.3052631578947365
