8431368,1,B0001FR0IO,"As a belly dancer and performer, I bought this video for a new choreography, but was exceptionally disappointed. When I first saw the cover and read the reviews I expected more than what I paid for. The quality is extremely bad, there's hardly any lighting or sound, and to top it off there is no camera angles. It seems as if it is a home video. The choreography was nothing out  of the ordinary. Her movements were rigid and inflexible. The outfit she picked for her performance was classless (there is a fine line between this exotic dance and that of a stipper).And I'm not even going to mention anything about her bonus performance (except that the stage wasn't even set for her). There's more to bellydancing than just turkish hip shimmies, the choreography needed the more mysterious undulating moves. But I'm giving it one star because I got a good workout. If you want to learn belly dancing moves, I suggest you skip this video and I recommend you buy veena and neena's mystic dance (which is around the same price). Overall the video is missing the essentials of the art of belly dance.",1086652800,14,1097,4.625641025641026
