8420289,4,B004AILAHK,You have to be or know Latvians to truly enjoy this movie but don't let that stop you. It revolves around an American young man's efforts to find his father's mistress and their daughter before his father passes away. Hilarity ensues as everyone prepares for the celebration of the summer solstice. It has a zany cast of characters who flesh out this romp through the midsummer madness that is Jni.,1417564800,,398,4.7
8420290,1,B004AILAHK,"I hate to put people down, but, wow, I couldn't watch this thing. The worst is that I'm a Latvian who grew up in the US, so any glimpse of the country or scrap of the language intrigues me. But, it wasn't enough in this mess of a pointless nonplot. One of the irritating things is that they can't make up their mind what language it will be in. We have French, Russian, Latvian, and English with no particular narrative reasons; I suspect these were the actors' preferred languages to make it easier to learn lines. Or, maybe not. But, as I say, I really couldn't watch it past a certain point and only sampled the last half, probably.",1416960000,,635,4.34453781512605
8420291,5,B004AILAHK,"Great, quirky film. Its nice to watch a film at times that doesn't include a constant barrage of gunfire.",1414454400,2,105,4.578947368421052
8420292,5,B004AILAHK,"With having a Latvian GF I can telling you it was so funny to see all these fetes and stereotypes living!! I have a real good time watching this movie, learned a few good things... I highly recommend it!",1393891200,3,203,4.230769230769231
8420293,2,B004AILAHK,The movie is a slapstick that is foreign enough so that most of the humor falls flat and the viewer is left out of the joke.,1385164800,,124,3.8076923076923075
8420294,5,B004AILAHK,"""This is a good film that is very funny and beautifully shot. The vivid colours and great use of candles, lights and fire in every scene balance out the dark of the shortest night of the year with the quirky characters perfectly. Has night time ever been so brilliantly captured in a film? I doubt it. It's the type of film that is just so pretty you don't want to look away despite the absurdities and randomness of the situations. They did all this with just a low budget and without being ostentatious like big Hollywood films."" (Anne Campbell)",1371081600,,547,4.5353535353535355
8420295,5,B004AILAHK,"I ordered this DVD, Midsummer Madness, because I have always had an interest in the work of the talented young man, Orlando Wells, who is the star.
I have followed the career of this actor/playwright, since he was a child, appearing in a memorable 1984 film of the Charles Dickens classic ""A Christmas Carol"" alongside his beautiful mother, Susannah York, and his sister, Sasha Wells, who played Belinda Cratchitt, to Susannah's Mrs. Cratchitt, and Orlando's Little Boy Cratchitt.
It is a most enjoyable fim, set in Latvia, during the celebrations for Midsummer - the longest day of the year.  It was well-acted, and in the end, quite touching.
I would recommend it to lovers of off-beat, thought-provoking films, with a quirky soul.
As usual, quick and efficient service from Amazon.",1302566400,5,784,5.030769230769231
