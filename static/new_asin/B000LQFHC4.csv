2712863,3,B000LQFHC4,"this film does live up to it for the graphic gore, and the shock value, but it is boring. Granted I am jaded, and depraved enough to eat a bowl of zita while watching this... again...it is gore to the extreme. However, after the initial shock of the scenes.. it falls short. I recomend this for any gore hound, just for the sake and it has its moments, but please do not spend more than $25.",1178409600,6,391,4.157894736842105

8163624,5,B000LQFHC4,"Let me just be frank here; this is a movie you sit down with a couple of your good buddies and see who wimps out first. This movie is just too sick to sit and watch by yourself. But as a group activity its fun to watch everybody squirm in their seats at the carnage that is displayed before them. IGN has rated this as the most disturbing movie ever made - and that's no wild boast as this film delivers more than what you would expect of it. I wouldn't even say this movie is for serious gorehounds (even though there is plenty of that). This is a movie for those who can handle going to the ugliest places of the deranged human mind. I gave it 5 out of 5 because even though its not an enjoyable experience, you cannot agrue with what's been accomplished here.",1280448000,,762,4.155405405405405
8163625,1,B000LQFHC4,"Mordum is literally an hour and a half of overweight, unattractive burnouts
getting naked, squirting fake blood on each other and screaming. Lots
and lots of screaming. Most of the video is too blurry, dark or shaky
to tell what's going on. This would have been shocking when I was a
teen, but at 28 it is tired. Looks like something my friends and I would
have made in junior high if we'd had a little more time on our hands and
were a little less creative. Weak sauce.",1265068800,3,470,4.292134831460674
8163626,2,B000LQFHC4,"I rated this film a 2 because it has no plot or story behind it.  It is basically similar to Blair Witch.  Again no story it is just a camera man following around serial killers as they mutilate and disembowel their victims,which is what originally attracted me to this film but I was disappointed and wanted a ""who done it"" gore fest.  This film is only intended for true gore hounds who only care about the blood and guts content,because believe me there is plenty of that.",1246320000,,475,4.436781609195402
8163627,1,B000LQFHC4,"quite possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life.  Do not pay a cent for this: it isn't even scary.  To sum it up, a bunch of metalheads go around with a camera, cackle like morons, and stick knives in dummys.  terrible special effects, low budget, and completely moronic.  a Gwar concert is waaaaaaay better and so much cheaper!
The only thing in the entire film that I found somewhat objectionable is the bathtub scene and it's only because of the idea behind it: the scene itself is not the least bit realistic.
I feel like my intelligence has regressed after watching this film.",1231459200,2,596,4.542056074766355
8163628,5,B000LQFHC4,"Well I saw this after watching Penance and the first August Underground.

This is one sick masterpiece.  It takes the first movie and literally makes it look like Rebecca at Sunnybrook Farm, ok, not really, but there was a farm used in the first film.  If you thought August Underground was sick and depraved that was only a primer for this one.  This time we have 2 new characters added into the mix, Crusty (the vomiting superwoman) and Killjoy.  Some reviewers have said that they really didn't like Killjoy but he has some of the sickest scenes in the whole series.

Fred is not in this one as much but he has a couple of cameo's, he's the director/writer/star of the first August Underground for those not initiated into the August Underground series.  It helped to add to the proceedings when he was on camera but what is shown on camera is one completely bone jarring flick.  My girlfriend who has watched the other 2 started to gag at some of the scenes that are shown here.  She didn't have that same reaction to the other movies in the series.

I think this film really is by far the sickest of the entire series.  There is not really a lot I want to say about what is seen because I don't want to give it away, you just need to see it if you are into seeing what real horror would look like.  It's shot very roughly to give you that reality element and it really works.

This is not a series for those that have weak stomachs and even if you got through August Underground, this one will have your jaw hanging open.  Great stuff and it's too bad that Fred is done with this series but I honestly don't see where else it can go.  If you haven't seen this I think it's worth a look but prepare yourself for just outright slaughter.  It does what it sets out to do, disgust, sicken and make you think, could there really be people out there that could do this?  That's why I say it's what real horror looks like, not because it's real but because it really could be and that's the scariest thing about a flick like this.  You know somewhere in the world someone might be at this right now. Wow! Great stuff Fred!",1226620800,,2120,4.297229219143577
8163629,3,B000LQFHC4,"Some classify this as a B-flick..I'd say it's more along the lines of a D-flick. .
The lorena bobbit scene was fairly well done...I mean it sorta looks like a guy cut his own thing off, but who's to say? I mean the lighting was poor, the camera was moving around...hardly got any focused views.. it's just tooo low budget for me. I have ADD and lose focus very quick..but especially with erratic stuff like this. OMG!

If you're REALLY curious, you can get it at xploited cinema (the maker of the dvd) for $24. I have viewed mine only twice and will put it up for $15. The people here who have it up for $65 are hoping you don't find cheaper sources on the web. I just want a decent reimbursement for my purchase. If you're really interested, buy mine. No loss here",1223942400,,765,4.275862068965517
8163630,4,B000LQFHC4,"Just tell yourself ""its only a film, its only a film""

screw last house on the left!!! that statement has never been so apparent to me before i watched this trash fest

I had to pause this film 3 times and say that to myself and force myself to laugh before i continued, or i think i would actually be mentally scared.

But at the end of the day, August underground ARE JUST FILMS, THEY ARE NOT REAL, so really, its all just a bit of gory fun.

Nasty rape scenes, genital mutilation, necrophilia, disembowlment, toeture, death by hammer, suffocation.........just some of the things to expect here.

not much plot, but i don't think a plot is what anyone is really looking for when purchasing this film. Just scene after scene of depravity.

This is definately only for people into rank horror films and exploitation, and if you cant detach yourself from real life when watching this then AVOID. It really will make you feel sick.

Technically the film is complete nonsence and rubbish therefore only deserves one star. But as a gore film, which is treally all it is, then its 5 stars all the way.

My friend puked when i showed him Ichi the Killer, I cannot wait to force him through this

If you actually enjoy this film........go see a doctor",1219708800,4,1244,4.517857142857143

Simulated Snuff.
Torture Porn.
Gorno.
Call it whatever you want,
it still won't change the effect this sequel will have on your soul.
You'll definitely need to follow this flick up with about 5 hours of Telecare. (Religious Television Station)
Because quite honestly, if this is the last movie you see before you die, you're seriously going to burn in hell.
There is no story to speak of, no plot, no character development.
It's just 3 psychopaths, their unsteady camera, and depravity after depravity.
Each one more jaw-dropping than the last.
Don't worry I won't ruin it for ya.
(I'll list them in the comments section for any who want to know the skinny)
Make no mistake,
this is a shaky home-video from a maniacs personal library,
And it's just a glance into their fun-loving, over-zealous world of madness.

*** Synopsis ***
3 Psychopaths went out ot play,
Went on a killing spree one day,
They had such enormous fun,
that they called for another psychopath to come.

*** For the Seasoned Gorehound ****
Personally I thought it would be quite a task to top the insanity of the first August Underground flick,
(That's right this is a sequel)
which was essentially a one man show accompanied by a cacophony of giggles from behind the lens.
But Fred Vogel takes a back seat this time around to the new Captain Giggles, and his ballistic sister, who really outdo themselves putting on a horrific show.
Suprisingly though, the lack of Vogel was ultimatlely disheartening.
I kinda grew accustomed to his explosive threats, and his Teddy-Bear demeanor after the first flick.
Everybody in this movie was amazingly convincing to say the least,
especially for an independent film.
Excellent performances all around.
Specifically the victims.
Some of them put on the most believable performances I have ever seen.
Everybody involved should be proud of themselves,
everybody that is.......except Killjoy.
He was just downright awful!!
I have never been so acutely aware that I was watching a movie in my entire life,
The minute this cat opened his mouth, the illusion of realism was shattered.
His performance completely takes you out of the moment.
His character was trite, unnecessary, and seemed rather tacked on to the overall movie.
Regardless,
The effects are phenominal this time around,
even better than the last time.
And the gore ......well when it rains it pours.
ONLY FOR FANS OF THE EXTREME!!!
