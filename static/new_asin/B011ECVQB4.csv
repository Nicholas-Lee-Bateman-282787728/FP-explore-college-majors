8724167,4,B011ECVQB4,"Nice star-studded old jazz TV special! BUT BEWARE OF MISLEADING COVER ART! The cover shows a screengrab from a Texaco / Columbia Records commercial for the ""Swing Into Spring"" LP, however, ALL of the commercials are CUT from the show on the DVD! The cover art should be changed to reflect the actual program and not what is MISSING!! Very disappointed the commercials are edited out. Otherwise enjoyed the show. - William",1520553600,,421,4.861111111111111
