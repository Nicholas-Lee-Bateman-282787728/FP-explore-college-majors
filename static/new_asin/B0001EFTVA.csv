1993909,3,B0001EFTVA,"Satoshi Kon's third movie is about a homeless bum, transvestite and runaway finding an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve as they attempt to search for the baby's parents (in order to give them a piece of their mind).  As the other reviews say, it's a really uplifting story about the spirit of Christmas, forgiveness, and destiny.
Unlike Kon's other two movies (PERFECT BLUE, MILLENNIUM ACTRESS) , this one is primarily a comedy and has a lot of funny moments and will get you shedding a tear or two.  I didn't think this movie was as strong as his other two, but it's definitely a tearjerker if you watch it during the Holiday Season.",1082246400,6,633,4.592920353982301
1993910,5,B0001EFTVA,"Contains some spoilers.
I just finished watching this movie. I'd been wanting it ever since I read an article in Animerica about it, but I didn't think it was out yet, so when I saw it in a Borders Bookstore today, I snatched it up as fast I could.
And...woah, I can barely describe it. Normal anime takes flawless beauties with high squeeky voices and makes them a magical hero. This movie takes a transvestite ""uncle bag lady"", a runaway teenage girl (who certainly doesn't look like almost every other teen you see in an anime), and an old pervy geezer who ""used to race bikes"", and makes them into heros.
One day, in the middle of an argument, the three hear the screams of a baby, and decide to investigate. What follows is a long heartfelt journey as they try to find Kiyoko's (what they name the little girl) parents. Throughout the whole movie, you'll find places where you'll be both bawling and laughing hysterically at the same time (which earns you a few odd looks from family members).  At other points in the story, you'll be watching in wonder as the four of them (Hana [transvestite], Gin [old man], Miyuki [teenager], and Kiyoko) look like they really ARE a family.
Speaking of THAT--The characters are so true to life it's amazing. They all have their little quirks, their own personalites, their differences...It's AMAZING what Satoshi Kon and his fellows can do with a used plotline!
And as the last thing I can think of, for I must hurry and watch it again before my brain explodes-The music is so FITTING for this it's not even funny. You'd think the music would be depressing, but the sounds of something like hip-hop and dance music seems to fit the movie even better.
...Woah.",1082160000,5,1701,4.6138613861386135
1993911,4,B0001EFTVA,"I rented this movie out of ceriosity. Hey, the animation looked  good, but I've been disappointed by recent anime flicks I almost passed it by. This isn't a typical rehased story or vaporware plot.  The characters are solid, flawed individuals, the story is comic, brutal, exciting and overall very heart warming. Highly recomended if you like quirky fun films.
The soundtrack is nice too. Not the best 5.1 surround, but it's there when it matters. The music is quirky and IMHO suites this film perfectly. Sorry, no english dub on this one. But an average dub job would ruin this great character film anyway.
Oh, and the preview for Otomo's ""Steamboy"" was a nice little bonus, too.",1081900800,,681,4.811965811965812

1993913,5,B0001EFTVA,"This is the kind of animated feature that puts the vast majority of live-action--and especially big-budget--movies to shame.  There is little in this glowing, passionate story about three of Tokyo's homeless finding a baby on a trash heap one New Year's Eve that couldn't be done on film.  But God is in the details, and as animation it pushes the boundaries of kitchen-sink reality outwards to make the film's themes that much bolder, broader, funnier and meaningful.  Beautifully-drawn characters, deeply-felt themes of love and truth, superb performances (even with the subtitles), and melt-in-your-mouth animation show why Kon is considered to be a master of the craft.",1079308800,2,673,5.330188679245283

Every nauance and detail of the characters is astounding. Most live-action films do not contain this kind of depth of character and story. And of course, this being a Kon film, just when you think you know what's going on, he twists it on it's ear, and it becomes a very different film from what you were expecting!

On Christmas Eve, three homeless people -- an alcoholic, a trans woman, and a female teen -- find an abandoned infant.  They decide to try and track down the parents of the child, and start out on their adventure following lead after lead.  A twist here and there and an ending that warms the heart.

Christmas miracles are piled onto the plot with a decidedly Shinto (but still miraculous) ending to the odyssey on New Year's Day.

Then come their wild adventures, as they try to reunite the infant with the mother who apparently abandoned her. Of course, it turns out to not be as simple as that. Nothing is quite what it seems. By the time they finish, the three street people are well on the way to redeeming themselves and those that they touch during this nearly magical holiday season. Not only is it a good story well told, but a beautiful one, too; the snowy cityscapes of Tokyo are breathtaking. Just a heart-warming, wonderful film. One of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen.

Where Perfect Blue and Paprika are more adventurous and challenging, they're also difficult to sit back and enjoy in a traditional sense without falling into a deep state of analysis. This one, of three bickering homeless chums who find an infant girl in the garbage, retains the quirks, charms and emotional punch of Kon's other works without challenging quite so many conventions. Sweet, funny and grounded, it's constantly flashing a dry wit and, although it often tugs at the heart strings, things never get overly soft or weepy. The trio of leads are diverse and interesting, each with an onion skin of personal history to explore, and their hunt for the child's parents amidst the overpopulation of a major world metropolis constantly jolts out in surprising new directions.

1993987,5,B0001EFTVA,"The main characters of Tokyo Godfathers are three homeless people: a middle-aged alcoholic named Gin, former drag queen Hana, and a runaway girl named Miyuki.  The film opens on Christmas Eve, with the three rummaging through the garbage.  As they look, they hear a cry of a baby.  The three discover a newborn baby girl, with a note asking someone to take good care of her, as well as a bag containing clues to the parents' identities.  Hana names the girl Kiyoko, which means ""pure child.""

As the three go on a journey to find the baby's parents, they rescue a high-ranking yakuza man who is trapped under a car.  It turns out the man knows the owner of the club that Kiyoko's mother used to visit; the club owner is marrying the yakuza man's daughter.  The yakuza man takes the three and the baby to the wedding, where they learn the baby's mother is named Sachiko, and are provided an address.  However, the party is interrupted by a Hispanic man who was disguised as a maid; he turns out to be a hit man.  After trying to shoot the yazuka man, the hit man takes Miyuki and Kiyoko hostage.  The film continues the adventures of the three and what they must go through to try to return Kiyoko where she belongs.

Like Kon's other works, nothing is as it seems on the surface.  As the three characters go on their journey to reunite Kiyoko with her family, secrets about each one is revealed.  The animation in the film also helps to punctuate the story being told the film.

The DVD release of Tokyo Godfathers is packaged with an illustration by Satoshi Kon.  The copy of the DVD that I have came with an illustration of Miyuki.  The DVD itself contains a making of documentary and previews.  The documentary runs for twenty-two minutes, and it has Japanese language with English subtitles.  The documentary provides background on the film, as well as on the main three voice actors.  The three voice actors are also interviewed.  The documentary also includes interviews with Satoshi Kon and some of the members of the production staff.  It was a rather well-done documentary, and the interviews with Satoshi Kon reinforced how much the anime industry lost with his passing in 2010.  The previews on the disc are for Tokyo Godfathers, Astro Boy, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Cyborg 009, Memories, Metropolis, Returner, and Steamboy.

Tokyo Godfathers is a great anime film to watch at Christmas time.  However, with the violence and brief bits of nudity, it's not an all-ages film.  On the DVD box, it says that the film is rated PG-13.  Tokyo Godfathers is a very well-made film, and should be in the DVD library of anyone who appreciates the work of Satoshi Kon.

1993989,4,B0001EFTVA,"`Tokyo Godfathers' is another great anime film from Satoshi Kon.

When three homeless people in Tokyo find an abandoned baby their lives are turned upside down as they struggle to look after her and find her parents.  A variety of seemingly unrelated events come together until the film reaches it's heart warming and satisfying ending.  Traipsing all over Tokyo they follow various clues in their hunt for the babies parents, whilst their own life stories unfold before us.

The dysfunctional homeless family make for humorous viewing, with an old geezer for the dad, a flamboyant gay man as the mother and a bitter, yet sensitive, girl as the `daughter'.  There's makes for a complex but touching family relationship.

The animation is very good and whilst not as lush or beautiful as Ghibli films, this is more gritty and realistic.  This film has a 12 certificate, but this is an animated film aimed more at adults.  The themes, language and some scenes are more adult orientated that other anime films out there.

This feels quite bleak at times due to the winter landscapes and muted colours, as well as the storyline in general. But, it is very well made and everything comes together perfectly at the end.  If you are a fan of anime films in general then this should please you and if you a fan of Satoshi Kon in particular, then this should leave you delighted.

1993992,5,B0001EFTVA,"I have always enjoyed fun anime with quirky, playful and intriguing plot-lines (which covers most anime lol) but ""Tokyo Godfathers"" is simply a magnetic, brilliant movie whatever its genre. An engaging storyline with colorful, serious and believable characters keeps the viewer glued to the screen anticipating the next bit of dialog and emotional plot-flips. So special a film is ""Tokyo Godfathers""; my family embraced it as the most recent addition to our 'holiday movie' yearly-must-sees since it embodies all the spirit of the holidays culminating with the warm fuzzy feeling of positive familial bonding. It is a perfect story of redemption, forgiveness and love poignantly if untraditionally presented.

If you want red-nosed reindeer, fluffy snowmen and jolly, fat Santas-- avoid this movie like the plague! BUT, if you want something different for a Holiday-time movie yet still want a Christmas-related tale, grab a copy of ""Tokyo Godfathers"" to watch with your friends, family and loved ones this season (or at any time of the year!).

1993995,4,B0001EFTVA,"I don't know why - it's probably the title - but I've always had the impression that Tokyo Godfathers was an animated Japanese gangster film. I should have known better than expect something so prosaic and predictable from a director like Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress). There are yakuza gangsters involved here, but only as one of the background elements that the director makes use of in this entertaining Christmas tale journey through the backstreets of Tokyo, when three down-and-outs find an abandoned baby in an alley on Christmas Eve and set off in search of its mother.

Even that old story, played out and parodied in many comedy movies, is given a rather different spin by Satoshi Kon - one of the very best directors working in Japanese animated features - starting off with the main characters. ""A bum, a homo, a runaway and a foundling"" is how homeless alcoholic Gin describes their odd little family unit, and there's a lot of fun to be found in such a gathering, as well as a little bit of self-reflection and sentimentality. And sure why not? It's a Christmas setting and inevitably, confronted with a baby left out on the streets, it's going to remind them of their own families and going to think about their own position, the chances they have lost and the lives that none of them will ever have again.

What's wonderful about Tokyo Godfathers however - and why it's an animated film rather than a regular live-action comedy-drama - is the fine detail that can be added to the characterisation and the exaggeration that can be indulged without it seeming unnaturalistic and out of place. Here, movements can be paced and coordinated, expressions perfectly thought through for what they reveal about the characters, and they are animated as ever with supreme precision. Satoshi Kon does perhaps manoeuvre events a little too smoothly and schematically here in this particular film, but it flows wonderfully and is full of wit and entertainment.",1270684800,,1979,4.904477611940298

*Spoilers*

When a trio of hopeless homeless 'bums' find an infant child thrown out in the trash on Christmas Eve, they are shocked and eventually angered that anyone would so callously dispose of a child. They decide to take the time, effort, and precious resources to scour the cold and unfeeling city for the mother of the lost infant, so that she can explain how she could throw out her baby. What they don't expect is the journey of pain, discovery, and healing that their journey brings them.

I generally tend to dislike 'journey' movies, because my heart strings can be tugged way too easily, and I leave the movie feeling drained and exhausted. However, I truly loved every second of ""Tokyo Godfathers"". Beneath all the pain, sorrow, and emotional heartbreak, there is genuine humor and an indomitable human spirit. It is fascinating to see how each of the three homeless have given up all hope in their *own* selves and lives, and yet they can't accept to see their companions give up their own hopes and dreams. This unlikely trio, composed of a young girl, an older man, and a homosexual transsexual, love each other dearly but aren't above heated arguments and disputes.

I would say it is possible that this movie is the most lovingly sensitive movie ever, towards all of its characters. Each character in this movie - and not just the 'main' ones - are fleshed out as real, three-dimensional characters. The homosexual transsexual 'Hana' is feisty and a common source of comic relief, but Hana's humanity is never sacrificed in service to humor. Gin could easily be portrayed in an unflattering light, based on his secret past, and yet he is always treated with quiet dignity. And young Miyuki is realistically portrayed as a confused and frightened young teenager, encased in a tough shell for protection from her own fears. The treatment of the homeless is always lovingly gentle - there is no false suggestion that these three are just 'too lazy' to find work, indeed it is probably more ""work"" being homeless than not! Instead, they are realistically shown as homeless because their spirit is broken and they no longer have any faith in themselves. It is telling that it takes a truly helpless child for them to find the strength to reenter the world that has hurt them and seek to heal their own hurts.

Seriously, after a single viewing, I am ready to label ""Tokyo Godfathers"" as one of the best movies ever - the combination of sensitivity, humor, spirit, and real character development is a work of art and a thing of beauty. Never sappy, ""Tokyo Godfathers"" pulls no punches and doesn't over-dramatize to force our heart-strings - it just tells the tale of a dysfunctional ""family"" setting out to right a wrong they can't bear to accept.

1994004,5,B0001EFTVA,"On X-Mas Eve in Tokyo, three homeless people, find an abadonned baby lying in the rubbish. The trio: Gin, an ex-gambler; Miyuki: a runaway teenage girl; Hana: a drag queen, decide to find the child's parents. They name her Kiyoko, and then look through some belongings that were left with the child for clues to her origins. A trip to a family cemetery finds them running across a yakuza boss who they help out from nearly getting run over by his own car. He takes them to a club that they found a business card for with Kiyoko, which turns out is where the dom's daughter is getting hitched that day. Once there, Gin realizes that the groom is the man who caused him to become poor years ago from a jibbed bet, but before he can try to get at him, a hitwoman accidently shoots the groom while trying to kill the dom. Miyuki and the baby are kidnapped by the hitwoman, while Gin and Hana seperate after arguing. Gin runs into an older homeless man, and he gets injured while protecting him from some punks. Hana meets up with Miyuki who escaped with Kiyoko, and they go to an Hana's old bar for drag queens, where they find Gin who was taken into care for his injuries. They later run into a woman who appears to be Kiyoko's actual mother, however she's instead suicidal, and it's up to the homeless trio to save Kiyoko in a great comedy/traumatic fashion.

This movie was directed by Satoshi Kon, who also did the movies Millenium Actress, Perfect Blue, Paprika, and the Adult Swim series, Paranoia Agent. This was a distinct departure from his normal supernatural/surrealistic thrillers. It was partially based on the western movie, 3 Godfathers. For Kon, this was a great piece of storytelling. The characters are very entertaining and believable. His appear to be more realistic looking than most anime characters. Not all the girls are thin with big hooters, and not all the guys look like girls with long spikey hair.

What makes this a great movie for X-Mas is there are so many points in it where you actually believe some of the plot devices or coincidences are genuine ""Christmas Miracles"". There's so many revelations about the characters lives as the story moves along, and how the all culminate at one of the most satisfying anime movie conclusions ever is really special. The other reason its a great title for the holidays is because its one of the few ones that isn't the special ""Christmas episode"" of an already existing anime series, and is great to see on its own merit.",1232841600,,2490,4.6058558558558556

I have to confess that my attention span has been conditioned by Hollywood, where plot takes off within a few minutes. With Tokyo Godfathers, traditional storytelling takes the stage, and important character development stacks up at the beginning, making for a very fun, very eventful second half to the movie. The combination of the three characters becomes a circus as half-truths from everyone involved suddenly starts to clash.

1994009,5,B0001EFTVA,"The phrase in the title came from one of the three homeless characters when they found a baby in the trash, but it also applies to anime fans and this film. There are not many cases in this genre in which you can watch a story that has the effect this one has on the feelings of the viewer. I do not pretend to be an expert on anime, far from it, but the only anime production that had a similar effect on me was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B00006HAWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>. Just the mere fact that ""Tokyo Godfathers"" can be put in the same echelon as that masterpiece should be telling.

When an unlikely trio of homeless people finds a very special Christmas present, their world is shook in ways in they do not think possible. Thus, a bitter old man, an ex-drag queen and a teenager with a grudge towards her family embark in a quest to find the parents of the beautiful baby girl they found in the trash. The story starts out slow, but it gradually draws you into it, until you are hopelessly hooked. Little by little we come to understand the facts that led the three characters to their current situation and we are mesmerized by their search, which leads them to interact with an array of characters that range from desperate to happy to be alive.

I particularly enjoyed the graphics of this movie, but you need to understand that these differ from the common benchmark for the genre. In the film we get drawings with a good amount of detail in the main characters and in the background when it is close-up. But the general background and people that are not as relevant to the story are drawn with a lot less details. I interpreted this as a way to highlight what is important, but different people will have different interpretations for its purpose. Another aspect that surprised me is how good the tone of the voice of the different characters blended with the mood. I have seen many anime films in which the voices of the characters are a monotonous high-strung dialogue, and this one is not like that at all.

This is a movie that portrays the worst and best in human nature, and many layers in between. Therefore, there are portions that are heart-wrenching and others that are uplifting. It definitely has all the components of a great dramatic story. There is even humor sprinkled throughout the story, helping alleviate the mood at times, but not detracting from the seriousness of the plot.

1994015,5,B0001EFTVA,"I saw this on some movie channel awhile back and fell in love. Every aspect of this movie is incredible, from characters, design, story, to the voice-overs, it was wonderful. It's definitely not your average giant robo/magic girl/samurai/demon/action/what have you-style anime. Instead it's a touching (almost believable, as far as anime goes) and engrossing film about a trio of hobos in search of an abandoned baby's parents on Christmas Eve. But there is so much more than that. Simply put, this is one of the few anime's to really touch my heart. Unless all you are into is Inuyasha style mediocrity, you must see this. A movie has never made me cry, yet this one came real close. I can't say exactly why, but I love this movie more than almost anything else I've ever seen. (even more than Spirited Away)",1151884800,4,809,4.74468085106383
1994016,5,B0001EFTVA,"I'll be the first to admit that my preference in anime and movies in general tends to be for the magic, the larger than life adventures, the epic battles and the surreal mind trips through other worlds.  But anime isn't all magical girls, mecha, battle action and hentai-and Tokyo Godfathers isn't any of those things.  Director and writer Satoshi Kon is a past master of dramatic tension and character development and those who have scene Millennium Actress or Perfect Blue may have more of an idea what to expect from this movie-but I suspect even they won't anticipate how the story twists and turns.

The setting is Tokyo at Christmas time.  The characters are three homeless people: Hana, an aging drag queen, Gin, an embittered drunkard, and Miyuki, a smart mouthed teenage runaway.  This unlikely ""family"" is about to find their lives forever changed by the discovery of a newborn baby abandoned in the trash.  Sounds kind of depressing, doesn't it?  The characters don't seem like they'd be likable at first, the animation isn't forgiving-these characters aren't idealized stereotypes.  And then the ""magic"" begins.  Satoshi slowly and subtly unveils his characters through the movie's unexpected twists and turns.  What starts as a quest to return a baby, becomes a journey of self-discovery, adventure and redemption for these three remarkable characters.  And by the end, you're breathlessly along for the ride.  It's a movie that's a reminder of how incredibly good character development can be-and rarely is, even on the live action screen.  For a viewer like myself, it was a surprising and touching treat.  And belongs in any decent anime collection.

The animation style is gritty and realistic.  Don't expect the typical big eyes or wild hair.  Nor are there the stylistic chibi-cuteness moments, or wild takes that are so common in anime.  It's not cute, and it doesn't try to be.  This isn't an anime for the kiddies-there's tough stuff to deal with here.  The nudity and sexuality of this story is pretty minimal-a few boob comments and a shot or two of babies breastfeeding.  The violence isn't gory or showy-but when it's included it cuts right through the viewer.  The real reason this isn't for kids is because it will take a mature audience to understand what's going on.  I don't think most youngsters will appreciate the subtlety, or be ready for the types of issues presented.  The message at the heart of this movie, however, is universal.  It's about all the connections and permutations of family, about the ties that bind us and bring people to care.  It's about small miracles.

If you are already an anime fan and you're willing to try something different from the usual fantasy or SF fare, this is a great place to start.  If this is your first foray into anime, or you've been put off from the medium before, this is also a great place to start.  If you're looking for curvy girls with saucer sized eyes and gumdrop colored hair, bouncy theme songs, cute fuzzy sidekicks and tricked out robot giants, find something else-this isn't the anime you're looking for.  If you like this, you might also want to check out Satoshi Kon's other work, especially Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress.

Happy Viewing! ^_^ Shanshad",1145923200,29,3252,4.9010989010989015
1994017,5,B0001EFTVA,"This film made me curious of what Satoshi Kon's other works are like.

What I liked about this movie is the diversity of the characters and the series of events that allowed them to face their pasts and patch things up. The haikus are good too. It is unusual to see homeless people as protagonists in this anime, but I think Satoshi Kon made the right choice.

I may not be an avid anime watcher, nor am I in the capacity to review this film in a seemingly professional matter. But in my opinion, I think that the only way to actually enjoy this film is to sit back and watch it as it is and not to look for its technical and non-technical failings.

To all animation (and non-animation) lovers out there, Tokyo Godfathers is really worth your time. It's the GREATEST anime I've ever watched so far.",1143849600,2,799,4.348993288590604

But I decided to give it a chance and see why this movie had gotten 3 stars (when it was out in the movie theaters). By the end, I felt like I had to watch it again, it was great. The visuals were fine, the story was intriguing, and overall I highly enjoyed it. The mix of comedy, seriousness, and touching emotions were put at just the right moments in the story that it just blended so well and helped to draw you into what was going on.

You won't find the big-eyed, super power, or robo tech type of animation here, which is popular with anime. This movie is done in a more realistic style. Nevertheless the drawings are done quite well.

All in all I think you'll find a winner with this movie.",1139961600,3,866,4.242424242424242

This is one of those films, and come to think of it even if I had some forewarning it still would've suprised me, becuase this anime covers so much.

Still though, to give you heads up this story is about three homeless people: a upper middle age man, a young girl recently runaway, and a transvestite.  Now, right of the bat the movie should seem interesting, but probably plot less.  However, the story picks up when the three discover a baby and, over very little time, their fate somewhat becomes intwined with it's fate.

See strange, right?  Somehow though, the ecclectic characters and the Holiday theme keeps it all together.  Through laughs, of which there are a plenty, and even some tough times the movie will keep you latched in.  And why not, the characters could be the start of a joke all on their own; this is true.  However, this movie is no joke.  Instead, it is probably one of the best animes (not relating to machines and robots) that I've seen yet.",1137542400,,1116,4.45320197044335
1994020,1,B0001EFTVA,"For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.

This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.

Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. ""A Christmas Story"" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.

Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of ""odd fellow"" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).

 I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.

The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to ""cling"" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.

Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.

Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as ""unhelpful"" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?).",1131667200,13,2851,4.5984251968503935

It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package.

And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved.

She was animated with so much attention to detail. It's so incredible! And then there's the story. Three homeless people find an abandoned baby and go out searching for the mother. These characters show so much heart and you really find yourself caring for them. And each of their situations for why they're homeless are all so real. So then they find the mother and then there's a huge twist in the story which I won't give away. I'll just say the ending is a miracle.

1994023,5,B0001EFTVA,"Having suffered through the painfully pretentious and shallow, pseudo-Lynchian mess of Perfect Blue, I was understandably skeptical about watching another film by Satoshi Kon (I have not yet seen Millennium Actress, but am now quite intrigued to do so). Tokyo Godfathers (a title which at first struck me as belonging most probably to a pseudo-psychological mafia thriller) was not only a pleasant surprise; it was the best anime feature I've seen in many years, probably since Ghost in the Shell, excluding anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Like the classic Grave of the Fireflies, Tokyo Godfathers struck me as unusual in the fact that it draws much from European cinema - English, Irish, German or Italian - while most commercial anime features try to mimic American filmmaking. But while Grave of the Fireflies was painfully sad and bleak, Tokyo Godfathers is irresistibly charming, and manages to be funny and incredibly touching at once like few anime films - few animated films, at that - ever achieve.

Tokyo Godfathers is remarkably non-violent, as pacifistic perhaps as Miyazaki's films. You won't find any grand futuristic structures or fantastical creatures here; in fact, the animation may seem crude at first. But the characters are where the film really hits its mark. Kon triumphs, like in his excellent series Paranoia Agent, by not succumbing to the accepted prototypes and standards of how characters should look in an anime film; the lead characters in the film are all gorgeously ugly, in a way that even Miyazaki had not yet dared to do. Even the child character, Miyuki, is chubby, and not cute and beautiful in the way little girls 'should' be, by the unwritten laws of anime. Thus, Kon's characters are believable and true to life; they are three anti-heroes, outcasts from society, each running away from their pasts. Especially charming is Hana (AKA 'Uncle Bag'), the golden-hearted transvestite, who supplies much of the film's comic relief but also some of its most touching moments.

Tokyo Godfathers - despite some far-fetched but amusing plot twists and coincidences - is at its core a very simple story, a beautiful little story about family, love and friendship. Few anime films are so unpretending; and thus, few anime films manage to be so strong. Watch Tokyo Godfathers; you'll laugh, you'll cry. And believe you me, ten minutes into it you'll forget it was ever animated.",1125792000,,2403,5.0810126582278485
1994024,5,B0001EFTVA,"When looking at Disney's early releases, it's surprising to see how many ""classics"" there is: Bambi, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and many others. Yet in recent years things haven't been so kind to them. Besides the technologically impressive but emotionally hollow Fantasia 2000, Disney hasn't really done a really great film. Home on the Range, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear don't really have the timeless quality that previous releases had. Enter an emerging line of japanese films and the films by Pixar to fill the gap. So we have the third film from the director of Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers.

Gin is a middle-aged ex-cycling champ. Hana is a proud but kind of pathetic drag queen while Miyuki is a runaway teenager. All of them have troubled pasts and issues which they confront once they find an abandoned baby, which they name Kiyoko. They decide to return the baby to its rightful parents only they end up meeting some interesting people such as a mob-type person, a spanish hitman, Hana's old group and some rather mean kids.

There's a certain charm with the film where you start caring about the characters even if it's not big on action sequences which is something that's really missing with today films. Watching the film there is a certain leap of faith you have to take since many of the film moments will ""yeah right, as if that would happen"" but the film's meant to be touching and sentimental so you can blame the filmmakers for being really sappy.

Really disappointing are the extras. You get ""2"". I put 2 in quotations marks cause there's actually just one. A kind-of informative making-of which has interviews with the director and the 3 leads(I had no idea Miyuki's voice actor was so damn hot) and it has 2 interviews, the first being the best. The interviewer talks too damn much. The 2nd extra is actually just trailers. Whoopee.

With films like Spirited Away, this one and others, maybe there's a new animation group we should be looking at. Only since it's animation from Japan, it probably won't get the recognition it deserves. Too bad.",1125619200,,2111,4.807162534435261

1994027,5,B0001EFTVA,"I loved this movie so much I watched it twice in a row.  Although very slow to start (my husband fell asleep) it is well worth watching and has an edge-of-your seat climax. The last third of the film is also quite hilarious.

The story centers on three homeless people who have banded together during a cold, snowy, Tokyo Christmas.  There is Hana, an aging yet proud transvestite, Gin, a former professional cycler, and Miyuki, a sixteen-year old runaway teen girl.  Hana and Gin are Miyuki's adoptive ""parents.""  Hana finds an infant girl, seemingly abandoned.  Rather than going to the police, Hana convinces the other two to try and locate the baby's mother, so Hana can ask her why she abandoned her child.

The three set out, encountering a Yakuza boss on his way to his son's wedding, a Spanish-speaking hit man, a group of vicious teens, and many ghosts of their past that cannot be chased away, no matter how much running away they do.  Everything eventually hits the fan, and the end of this movie is moving beyond compare.

This film has pervasive references to homosexuality, and has some very violent moments that convey the brutality humans are capable of.  But this is primarily a sensitive movie that shows the good people are capable of and encourages the viewer to look beyond a person's outer appearance. There is much crying in this film, and a close-up of babies nursing from breasts.  Anyone who is looking for anime in the way we have come to understand it will be disappointed.  This film is a story that could have used live actors or even been a stage play.  There is no magic except a Christmas miracle.  I think that is the best kind of magic.

The DVD has a long and comprehensive making-of feature.  The director is interviewed by an executive in the Japanese film industry and by the voice actress who plays Miyuki.  The voice actors who played Hana and Gin also have a say.  The art and music is explored, as well as how the film played to a foreign audience (U.S., New York) and in Japan.

One bone to pick: Hana's facial expressions and mannerisms are so over the top and drag queen cliche.  Is this the only way gay men can be portrayed in film, in the East as well as the West?",1116201600,3,2213,4.526448362720403

All I can say is WOW! What a funny, thrilling, touching story of love and the power love has to work miracles.

I know that sounds hokey, but I think you'll agree when you watch how the films story falls neatly into place, almost like guidence from a ""divine"" hand.

The trio of heros, three homeless folks who stumble across an abandoned baby, are priceless and entertaining. You'll definately be rooting for the three and hope for a ""happy"" ending for them as well as the baby.

This movie is rated PG 13 but as a mom I think that some older children, with parental guidence, will learn a lot from the films story lines. That life is precious and we sometimes don't respect our own lives enough to realize that we deserve better. Besides minor violent scenes, the ""drag queen"" character, and one breastfeeding scene it's definately nothing compared to the violence/sexuality in US films. But use you're own discretion with your kids.

This animation speaks for itself-a visual feast.

Never thought that a japanese director would direct in such a marvelously way without showing any meaningless killings and tons of blood like most of the anime do (or meaningless, slow paced various scenes that most of the japanese-chinese movies have). The directing was too much for an anime and together with the state of the art technology the final result of both directing and anime was great.

 2. Really funny, and humorus made me laugh more than a few times and again I laugh very hard with the ""eastern asian"" humor. This was clever and right to the point.

 3. Nice dialogues that meant something and told the story correctly.

 Overall this anime exceeded by far my expectations and I am looking forward to seeing more movies coming from this director. The last but a bit embarassing thing is that I hate the good christmass movies. I do so because they make me shed some tears (e.g Scrooged with Bill Marey etc).

""tokyo godfathers"" tells a charming tale of three homeless people on the streets of tokyo one christmas season. they stumble across a baby and work tirelessly to return the baby to her mother. what unfurls is not a unique sequence of events, but still it is told such skill and warmth that you're impressed with the quality of filmmaking and story telling. we find out about the drag queen's past and why he's out on the street, why the alcoholic is both miserable and excited at the thought of taking care of the baby, and why the teenage girl jumps between disliking the baby and being so determined to see it returned home.

the story's complexity works well, only because each plot twist adds to the richness of the story. the complications bring depth to the characters and overall mosaic of characters without bogging it down. the pace is appropriate and moves well. the art captures the story's moments with skill and charm. and finally, the character development itself is as impressive as any well written film with real actors.

The animation is beautiful, perfectly capturing the loneliness of the homeless during the holidays.  The dialogue between the three main characters seems natural, and the Japanese voice actors are excellent.

1994036,5,B0001EFTVA,"Directed by Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress), this animated movie is an unusual journey into the life of Tokyo street people. Three derelicts - a drag queen, a drunk, and a teenage runaway - make a bedraggled, edgy life together on the streets. In the face of thugs who beat the homeless and a brutal Tokyo winter, they have formed a tattered family, protecting and helping each other. One day they stumble across an abandoned baby, and Hana, the drag queen, is determined to keep it. Hana is an outrageous actor, dramatizing every moment, but turns out to have a surprising amount of steel underneath his movable stage. With the reluctant help of Gin and Miyuki, he manages to get food and clothes for the baby, then sets out to find the mother. The journey forces the three friends to draw on all their resources, opening doors into their past lives and exposing the raw wounds that put them on the streets.

I have never seen a Japanese film that portrays this underside of urban life, making me wonder how accepted it was in Japan. The director refuses to pity his characters or make them objects of scorn. The drag queen in particular is full of life, breaking into song and holding onto a kind of noblesse oblige incredibly at odds with his circumstances. Gin is given to drunken self pity, but has an enduring and unjudging loyalty to Hana. Miyuki is a desparate street child, acting with tough bravado while terrified that she has broken from her family forever.

The animation is georgeous and detailed, much more a work of love than the somewhat stilted animation in Perfect Blue. Hana's robes dance across the screen, and even the cardboard and tin shacks of the homeless are lovingly rendered. The final scenes on a windblown Tokyo rooftop are beautiful and eerie. Satoshi Kon's animation work rivals that of Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), and an affection for his characters shows in his drawing. Watch the moment when Hana, homeless and without a dime to his name, breaks into an exuberant chorus of ""Crimb every mountain, ford every stream..."" The movie's generous spirit is aptly summed up in a raucous, extremely strange Japanese version of ""Ode to Joy"" that plays over the credits.",1095120000,2,2238,4.795336787564767
1994037,5,B0001EFTVA,"With such films as ""Perfect Blue,"" ""Millennium Actress"" and now ""Tokyo Godfathers, "" Kon Satoshi has rapidly ascended to the ranks of the masters of animation in Japan, side by side with such dignitaries as Miyazaki Hayao, Takahata Isao, Otomo Katsuhiro and Oshii Mamoru.

Like his other films, ""Tokyo Godfathers"" takes place in modern Japan and part of the joy of the film is seeing the wonderland of Tokyo come alive in vivid animated splendor.  To achieve this particular look, Kon filmed live scenes of Tokyo, then animated overtop of the backgrounds, to give his characters a completely realistic environment in which to live their fantasy.  The overall effect is really amazing.

The characters are three homeless people, each with a hidden background of severe pain that buries their proverbial hearts of gold.  They form a strange, nomadic family, with Gin, a decade-long veteran of the Tokyo streets with a sad and mysterious past,  Hana, a slightly pathetic aging drag queen who wants to play the role of mother to the odd clan, and Miyuki, a hard, aggressive teenager who isn't quite sure about the decisions that lead her to this life.  Add to that Kiyoko, a foundling baby abandoned in a sack of garbage and discovered on Christmas eve, and the family is complete.

As with ""Millennium Actress,""  Kon effectively weaves together several stories into an complete picture, each thread joining together briefly as it touches the lives of one of the three characters, then separating as they part.  However, in the world of ""Tokyo Godfathers"" there are almost no strangers, and each person met along the path contributes something to the Christmas miracle of Kiyoko.

""Tokyo Godfathers"" is very touching and sentimental, as a proper Christmas movie should be.  But it is the sentiment and love won through hardships and pain, and the film does not lack for an edge.  And then there are miracles, and wonder.

A really excellent movie altogether.  It would be a shame if more people didn't get the chance to see it.",1094860800,49,2023,4.926253687315635
1994038,5,B0001EFTVA,"Since Katsuhiro Otomo's breakthrough anime movie ""Akira"" (for its cell animation and superb tale of Armageddon), a string of other good and worth watching movies bring audiences around the world to other anime features like ""Ninja Scroll"" (for its blend of action & horror), ""Ghost in the Shell"" (for its sci-fi originality), ""Metropolis"" (for its first digital animation & cell animation), ""Spirited Away"" (for its childlike fairy tale meant for children around the world), ""Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade"" (for its political tale of revolution) & ""Escaflowne"" (for its fantasy, adventure & romance).

But on a rare occasion, comes a modern day epic adventure from creative director Satoshi Kon's ""Tokyo Godfathers"".

The title may make you think that his movie must be about gangsters. It isn't at all. It's about 3 homeless people that left their past behind, only a chance that they found an abandon baby takes them on an epic journey of life, pain, laughter, fate & coincidences that makes you believe between the days of Christmas & New Year... miracles do happen.

I have yet to watch any of Satoshi Kon's anime feature, but his 3rd movie has won me all over and this is one anime feature you must have, whether you're an anime fan or not, is worth putting this DVD on your shelve as a collection. It may not have an English Dub, but it's not really that bad to read the subtitles while watching the movie. And with Christmas around the corner, try this new classic.",1094688000,2,1468,4.817460317460317
1994039,5,B0001EFTVA,"During a cold white Christmas in Tokyo three homeless characters, Hana, Gin, and Miyuki, with different pasts, discover an infant thrown away among garbage.  Hana, a transvestite, dreams of having a child of his own and considers the infant a godsend.  However, the drunkard Gin brings to light that someone must have had the child and someone might be missing the infant.  Hana reconsiders her ""gift"" and decides that they will try to find the mother and an answer to why the child was thrown away.  Gin and Miyuki, a teenage girl, agree and together the odd trio begins a heartwarming search for the parents of the infant.

Tokyo Godfather is both a warm and distressing animated film that brings numerous topics to the table such as gambling, alcoholism, poverty, homosexuality, generosity, family and much more.  These topics create several different subplots that are all intertwined into the main theme of the film, which is brought to the audience with a pragmatic dialogue.  The realistic environment is alleviated through the animation which eases on the suffering of the audience as some scenes would be too distressing if really filmed.  Tokyo Godfathers also switches interjectionally between tragedy and comedy which leaves the audience with a humorous, yet serious cinematic experience.",1093996800,,1300,5.186602870813397
1994040,2,B0001EFTVA,"""Tokyo Godfathers"" is not, as the title would suggest, a film about the Japanese mafia, but rather a sentimental fable about three homeless people - a destitute gambler, a lovesick transvestite and an ill-tempered runaway - who find an abandoned newborn babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a dumpster, on Christmas Day.  The film recounts their journey through the city as they search for the little girl's mother.

This animated feature is indeed lovely to look at, capturing the stark beauty of its snowy urban landscape in finely drawn detail.  The story, however, steeped in sentimentality and riddled with coincidence, plays like a third-rate Dickens melodrama, minus the richness of character and subtlety of wit the Master would have brought to the task.  The three main characters aren't particularly interesting, and the story, such as it is, is tedious, unfocused and rambling.  I guess there has to be a reason for a story to be done in animated form, but ""Tokyo Godfathers"" fails to provide us with that reason.  The backgrounds are pretty, but the film itself is instantly forgettable.",1091664000,9,1110,5.071428571428571

The characters are the most realistic in  any anime I have seen. I love how when the youngest is worried bout the other 2 bumbs and when she is relieved they are ok she saysuncle bag or geezer. But my personal favorite is the trans. I recommend this movie to every1. Also by the way this movie takes place on Christmas. So watch it wit the family on Christmas eve or somethin.

1994042,4,B0001EFTVA,"Three homeless people are celebrating Christmas Eve together.  Gin is a former bicycle racer who left his family after amounting incredible gambling debts; Hana is a drag queen who left the safety of her surrogate family after a violent incident at a bar; Miyuki is a young girl who ran away from home after a fight with her father.  While rummaging through a garbage heap, they hear a baby crying and find an infant girl hidden among the trash.  Determined not to let the child have unhappy memories of Christmas, Hana convinces the others that they need to find the child's family.  Along their journey, each is forced to confront his or her own past and what forced them to turn away from their families.
Filled with beautifully animated scenery, great stories about friendship and family, and just a hint of the magical, director Satoshi Kon has crafted a marvelous anime film that goes beyond the futuristic action that I've usually associated with anime.  The characters are very human, very believable.  It shows you just what animation can do as a storytelling medium.",1087257600,,1076,4.852459016393443
1994043,5,B0001EFTVA,"I consider this movie a breakthrough. It is the first I've seen that equals - or passes - good live-action movies for subtle development and interaction of characters.
It took the first 30-45 minutes to get going, but that time was used to establish the characters and the setting. Be patient - it's worth the wait. After that, the movie is really about families. I don't mean the ""Leave it to Beaver"" kind, with Mom, Dad, and their children by each other. I mean the real families these days, where the ideas of Mom and Dad need to flex and where the children are unrelated to one or both. I mean a real family with real problems, holding together because everyone is struggling to hold it together.
The animation is good and the character animation are very good, but excellence is the norm these days. The plot and story are what make this movie stand out. As an aside, I was interested to hear a few English words adopted into the Japanese idiom, ""homeless"" and ""godfather"" being the most obvious. I was also interested to see that the Spanish speech wasn't subtitled - English speakers will need to puzzle it through, same as the Japanese listeners did.
This isn't an ""adult"" movie, but there's not a lot here for kids. That's fine. Kids have their own movies, and we need ours.",1085961600,54,1283,4.558441558441558
1994044,5,B0001EFTVA,"Before I saw it, I read in one of customers' reviews that while watching this animation people tend to believe the characters being under impression that this is a live movie with real actors. I watched it today - it is totally true! I could see realistic emotions of drawn characters, which I never experienced watching animation.

And I loved the story. Don't believe to trailer; what you saw there is not what you expect to find in the movie... the story develops in a very dynamic way with absolutely unexpected result! That was really entertaining, and thanks to other customers for not disclosing the plot in their reviews! Intrigued? Watch it!

By the way, please keep your children out of this DVD, as there are some violence, a few explicit talks, and lots of serious social problems, which you would not be able to explain them....",1083715200,2,841,4.714285714285714
1994045,5,B0001EFTVA,"This second feature by Satoshi Kon, like ""Ice Age"", spins off of John Ford's 1948 western ""Three Godfathers"" as a Christmas allegory of three grown men trying to deal with an orphaned baby.  This time, we have a runaway teenaged girl, an alcoholic ex-athlete and a middle-aged drag queen who form a kind of family in the underworld of Tokyo's homeless.  The discovery of a baby in a trash dump takes them all over town for the week between Christmas and New Years (thus starting on a Christmas holy day and ending on a Shinto/Buddhist holiday), with the coincidences and miracles becoming more and more improbable yet ultimately satisfying.
This hasn't been dubbed into English, which is just as well, because the original voices are perfect, from the hysterics of the runaway to the completely unfeminine voice of the drag queen (if it HAS to be dubbed in future, better that Harvey Fierstein takes the role of Hana).  And while this movie and the anime series ""Witch Hunter Robin"" give intriguing glimpses into post-Bubble homelessness in Japan, and a feature on the subject would have been a welcome extra, I can see why the DVD producers didn't dwell on it.  Still, a great movie from a great director.",1083369600,8,1206,4.783653846153846

It's also been done at least three other times as well.  I love the Wayne version but this one is the best of the bunch.  Funny, warm and ultimately gentle as three homeless people undertake a life changing mission involving a abandoned baby.  The change from three bad men to three homeless people is an inspired one and gives the story & characters room to breath.  Well worth your time.",1083196800,4,519,4.4787234042553195
