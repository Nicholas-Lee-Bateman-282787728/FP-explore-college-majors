The story-line is well scripted and suspenseful; the main characters are portrayed extremely well by Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker.  You will not be disappointed with this movie as it holds itself well to the studio system of movie production (such as many classics of the 1930s & 1940s).

This is the description that is given and let me say this, Eleanor parker always dazzled me in just about everything even though I recognize she has a penchant to overact. here it seems a necessary evil and as for Robert Taylor he lays his part in a amall way. This is a fun movie with gorgeous Egyptioan sights and scenery. The story is good too, i am grateful that it wasnt' overlong. It wasn't hard to figure out but still kept my attention.

838215,1,6304308620,"The 2016 Warner Archive Collection widescreen DVD is the result of the film having been cropped twice.  Firstly, the original 1.75:1 cinema image was cropped on its sides to produce a 4x3 pan and scan print to fit obsolete cathode-ray tube TV screens.  Secondly, a copy of the 4x3 pan and scan print was cropped top and bottom to produce a 16x9 image to fill current HD TV screens.  Thus the Warner Archive Collection widescreen DVD image may be just 60% of the original cinema screen image.  No wonder the image is so poor.

If you have an older 1.375:1 Academy ratio copy of Valley of the Kings then hang onto it because, although pillar boxed, it will show about 80% of the original cinema screen image.

'Valley of the Kings is at best a B-grade movie but the views of Egypt in 1954 are what make it appealing. The film deserves a proper restoration of the original 1.75:1 film image.

838380,2,6304308620,"This movie was one of the first CinemaScope movies made in 1954.  As a child, who saw the newspaper advertisement, I wanted to see this movie.  Now old and moldy, I have been searching high and low for it.  I would not bother with VHS as that is so poor in video and sound quality.  I did find a relatively good quality edition of it in typical 4 X 3 standard TV definition on EBAY.  It as a DVDR.  When I heard of the Warner Brothers edition in ""widescreen,"" I was delighted and immediately purchased it.

When I received the Warner Brothers Archival Collection edition and viewed it, I noticed that it was not in full CinemaScope, but in a 16 X 9 aspect ratio.  Well good enough, I thought; better than 4 X 3.  Then I noticed that the title credits were not as clear as my EBAY DVDR.  The grain was more pronounced.  I began comparing the two, and it was true.  The possibly, bootleg DVDR looked better than the official Warner Brothers edition.  By the way, I viewed them on  12 foot projected screen.  Then I noticed that there was less sky, and that in closeups the actors had their bottoms cut off.

I now realize that this is not a widescreen movie bit a cropped, possible TV print.  It does not show more.  It shows less of the image than did the standard definition TV version that was previously (possibly still is) available.  In doing so, they had to expand the image to fit your TV and thus lower the image resolution and increase grain.  I have attached photos of the two that illustrate the cropping.  The first should show all the image.  The second will look wider, but that is because their heights have been made equal.  It shows that the top and bottom has been chopped.  I suggest you stay away from this near fraud and go buy a bootleg version that does not say widescreen.",1472601600,15,1795,4.337349397590361

UPDATE  I returned the first movie thinking it might have been just a fluke. The new one they sent out is just as bad as the first.

This time he is a rough Archaeologist, who helps a woman (Eleanor Parker)  find the lost tomb of a Pharaoh, who knew the Biblical Joseph.  Taylor is kind of an early Indiana Jones.  It is a good adventure with a payoff that makes no sense.  Joseph was a Hebrew, who believed in the God of Abraham not in Jesus.  So finding Christian objects in a tomb that was sealed 2,500 years before Jesus was born is a bit of a stretch.

I was a little disappointed that the film was not in widescreen format, but then maybe it wasn't produced that way. The colour was quite splendid even if the acting presentation seemed a little stilted.
I spent a month in Egypt in January 2011 so it was interesting to see how much the historical scenes have changed. Having been to Abu Simbel I was interested in looking at my photos to where the ""tomb"" in the facade was supposed to be. Obviously the fight scene on one of Rameses II's statue heads would not have been on real thing, in those days, many of the tomb interior shots would have had to have been recreated in a studio. Since Seti I's tomb is off limits today, from what I have seen of photos I find it hard to believe that that tomb was used for for the movie.
I found the film quite enjoyable.",1356652800,4,896,4.245614035087719
838660,5,6304308620,"Attention belly dancers, dance ethnologists, ethnomusicologists, students of Egyptology and archaeology, anyone interested in recent Egyptian history and religious/political issues, fans of Indiana Jones or the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies. See this movie. It's not available on DVD but do what you can to get this in your collection. The movie is a serious telling of an archaeological exploration combined with intrigue, mystery, murder, suspense, and of course, a love triangle. Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker are very good in the lead roles as the swashbuckling archeologist and his love interest, an archaeologist's daughter on a quest to prove her father's theories.

I enjoyed the scenes of the dust storm, the scorpion (having lived in Arizona at one time, I am very familiar with both dust storms and scorpions), the glimpses of traditional tribal costumes, Bedouin tents, camels, street vendors, the entire atmosphere.

Beyond that, this movie is an important piece of humanity's history in that it shows Egypt as it will likely never be again.

Ethnomusicologists and dance ethnologists will enjoy the scenes of the great Samia Gamal's dancing on stage in an open cafe. They will also like the tribal cane dance and authentic music played on traditional instruments - tabla (hand drum), riqq (tambourine), rebab (bowed instrument), frame drums, ney (flute), mizmar (reeded wind instrument), and so on. It is refreshing to see and hear the real thing. Too often Hollywood uses fake belly dancers and/or plays a cheesy Hollywood score superimposed on scenes of a native banging a drum. In our own time, belly dancing barely exists anymore in Egypt, it has been severely restricted over the decades as the extremist versions of Islam have been propagated and the flame of la danse orientale in Egypt may well be snuffed out forever under the current regime. Even the music is almost a memory of what was. Very few people in the world know how to make and play these instruments anymore and since the severe versions of Islam frown on music, this too, may be disappear in the new future.

On top of these dance and music treasures are other glimpses into Egypt that was. Western Europeans and Americans, including unveiled women, freely wander and mingle with Muslim men in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Egyptian men are shown enjoying wine, music, and of course the belly dancer. I understand alcohol is still legal in Egypt (although not for sale to Egyptians) but for how long? Perhaps most poignant are the scenes with Father Anthimos, who appears to be an eastern orthodox priest of some kind, perhaps one of Egypt's Coptic Christians. I am not an expert on Christianity generally or Egypt specifically but Egypt was almost completely Christian and part of the Byzantine Empire at the time the Muslims invaded, sacked Alexandria and took over the territory in the 7th century, killing many thousands in the process. While of course forcing most to convert to Islam, Muslims allowed some Christians to keep their religion and were able to tax them and otherwise profit from having them around.

In modern times, about 10% of Egypt's population was still Christian. However, anyone watching the news will know the Christian community in Egypt is under attack since Mubarek was ousted - an incredible slaughter in 2011 and continuing in 2012. Just Google and read all about it. It's not just the murders, but the destruction of beautiful, historic churches (archaeological treasures themselves) through burning, vandalism, looting, and defacing with graffiti. In the Valley of the Kings movie, Father Anthimos moves comfortably among both Muslims and Europeans. He is at ease in his homeland among the pyramids and other archaeological wonders of Egypt. Were a similar person to walk about Egypt right now, he would almost certainly be murdered or at least harassed and threatened.

And finally, the Egyptian ruins - the world's heritage - the pyramids, Luxor, the Valley of the Kings, and Abu Simbel (filmed in situ before it was moved and reconstructed by an international group in the mid-60s to make way for the Aswan High Dam). It is entirely possible the current government will try to destroy these priceless monuments in the way the Taliban destroyed the 2,000 year old Bamiyan Buddhas (and other ancient treasures around Afghanistan) back in 2001. Afghanistan had been a important stop on the Silk Road and a strategic battleground for everyone from Alexander the Great on down and was home to many of the world's historic treasures. Egypt has, if anything, even more to lose than Afghanistan did under the Taliban.

Movies like Valley of the Kings allow us small glimpses into the world that was and are part of our shared cultural heritage that must be preserved and passed on to future generations.",1341446400,6,4825,5.061635220125786
838661,5,6304308620,"This isn't a serious or ""meaningful"" film.  It is pure entertainment, beautifully photographed on location in Egypt.  The stars, Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker, had great chemistry both off-screen and on.  Taylor manages to be glamorous even when trapped in a sandstorm.  The plot is relatively thin with Parker seeking to validate part of the Old Testament by finding the tomb of the Pharaoh who reigned in the time of the Biblical Joseph. She bats her eyelashes at Taylor who comes along happily. Then she introduces her husband, Carlos Thompson.  There are horse and carriage chases, murders, the aforementioned sandstorm, a spectacular fight at Abu Simbel, a scorpion attack--all in ninety minutes.  Given the slower pace of movies in the 1950s, there is also time for Taylor and Parker to discover each other more thoroughly (over some fermented goat).  Egyptian belly dancer Samia Gamal shakes her stuff at the demure Parker.  The film isn't currently available on DVD but the WB Archive is releasing lots of new titles each month so they may get to this gem.",1339200000,2,1067,4.988700564971752
838662,4,6304308620,"Back in 1954 when TV was eroding Hollywood's popularity, having viewers staying home rather than venturing out to the movie theatre, MGM decided to make this large scale (for the time) movie.  It was filmed pretty much on location in Cairo, Egypt, not easily done 50 years ago, the movie saw its release on 23 July 1954.

Using the then popular archaeologist's writings of the time, C.W. Ceram,  to supplimate the script, much attention was focused on Joseph and the practice monotheism in Egypt during the XVIII Dynasty.  The same actual historical dynasty of Amenhotep/Akhenaten (1353-1336 B.C.) that had the heresy to try to bring monotheism to Egypt, Akhenaten had the beautiful, famous Queen Nefertiti as his queen, with King Tut following closely behind.  The film, shot in Eastman color, is still as colorful as when filmed, with a script as colorful as the actual history of the XVIII Dynasty it mentions.  We get to glimpse the actual Valley of the Kings of 50 years ago, but more interestingly for those of us who are old enough to remember, the statues of Abu Simbel before they were rescued to higher ground to avoid their being flooded out.

This movie may be only a Hollywood drama but it is an 86 minute drama with flare, and interesting focus, if a bit dated.  The turn of the 20th century world (the year 1900) it attempts to portray no longer exists, if it ever existed as portrayed, but the film does make for interesting viewing.  Though I have found no evidence of it ever being released on region one DVD, the film can be viewed every once in awhile on Turner Classic Movies, as it was last shown there on January 2nd 2010.

The cast included:

Robert Taylor
Eleanor Parker
Carlos Thompson
Kurt Kasznar
Victor Jory
Leon Askin
Aldo Silvani
and
Samia Gamal (the dancer)

The movie is one that offers a comfortable 86 minutes of entertainment with small elements of actual history thrown in.  While a hodgepodge of history it does transport one backwards into the majesty, intrigue, and glamour of ancient Egypt.

838663,3,6304308620,"""Valley of the Kings"" shapes up as an exciting but familiar story, lacking imagination, about archaeologists and pharaoh's tombs...

Desert people, sand storms, caravans of giant camels, typical Faiyum oasis, chase of carriages in the crowded streets of Al-Qahirah (The Victorious) known as Cairo, old markets and antique shops, the Nile, Saint Catherine's Greek Orthodox monastery (situated on the inspiring Mount Sinai), the Pharaonic Temple of Luxor, the grandeur of the Great Sphinx and the 3 great pyramids of Giza (Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure), give a proper ambiance to a mysterious tale...

Robert Pirosh's direction is strong and well-developed, and the thrilling natural settings steal the picture...

Taylor--an attractive masculine grace against wide vistas and bright skies, shortly finds himself forced to prove his courage with fists and even swords, climaxing in a murderous struggle with Carlos Thompson on the highest peak of one of the four gigantic statues of the great pharaoh Ramesses II, at the Great Temple of Abu Simbel... But Eleonor Parker's acting had more fire in it... She emits, on the screen, a source of radiant energy of a young woman who knows exactly where, and with whom, she wants to be...

Thompson, suitably menacing and malicious, provides the excitement as it seems he is in association with dangerous vicious Egyptian grave robbers who sell tomb treasures on the black markets...

Kurt Kasznar is evil and trouble as his sinister ally... Leon Askin plays both sides as a coward dealer in antiques, and Victor Jory is a frightening attraction as he tries to win Taylor in desert swordplay... One of the great Egyptian belly dancers of the 50's, the talented Samia Gamal, gives to the atmosphere a graceful touch in proportions and techniques, style and attitude...

If you like to take a tour of this beautiful country and see wonderful sites of an ancient land, temples, tombs, treasures and secrets forever cherished within your mind, and you love to see the legendary Robert Taylor singing in Arabic in a relaxing moment aboard a Nile sailing boat, don't hesitate to watch this film--thin as drama with little action and suspense but loaded with splendid locations...",1234310400,6,2211,5.162011173184357
838664,5,6304308620,"Anyone who has been to Egypt immediately recognizes the authenticity of this movie's location shooting, which uses real places throughout to present a nearly perfect 1954 travelogue of the Nile Valley civilization.  Especially interesting are the scenes at Abu Simbel and Philae, both of which were moved after the film was shot to higher ground, at new locations that are less authentic and dramatic.  Great landmarks are shown here before they were taken apart and placed in modern settings that spoiled the mystery and wonder of these ancient monuments.  The original location of Abu Simbel (before the Aswan Dam required its dismantling and removal to an articifical hill built high above the rising waters of Lake Nasser) reveals how phony the new site looks today, with the statues scarred with slice marks and the new cliff face looking like a ride at Disneyland.  The hillside above the statues in the movie (which is featured in a major fight scene) looks magical and ancient, like it must have looked when Burkehardt rediscovered it in 1815, or David Roberts painted it a decade later for his wonderful Egyptian portfolio.  It's breathtaking.  The movie even goes inside the temple, and shows us the wonderful statues of Ramses there.  The shots of Philae near Aswan are also historical records, because they show the temples half-covered by water in the lake above the old Aswan dam, a romantic and beautiful scene that was forever changed when the monuments were moved to another island in the river.  Most Hollywood movies use Egyptian sites as backdrops, and edit their stories so that characaters walk out of one ruin and into another 50 miles away without explanation (see Death on the Nile).  Valley of the Kings not only films on site, but moves the story around the monuments in a realistic way that looks just like the real place.  The scene shot in Luxor Temple is a prime example, showing the characters walking around the columns beside the river in the moonlight that reminds me of my visit there.  The fighting scene filmed at  Abu Simbel uses few special effects, and provides camera angles of the statues that tourists could never see at the site.  It reminds me of the famous scene with Cary Grant on Mt. Rushmore in North by Northwest, filmed five years later in 1959.  Did Hitchcock get his inspiration from this 1954 scene on Abu Simbel?  Finally, seeing this great film on VHS is a crime, because the full frame presentation chops off the corners of the wonderful location shooting, and reduces an early Cinemanscope masterpeice to a costume drama with much of the scenary off frame.  Message to the filmmakers: please issue this marvelous movie on DVD in widescreen format and restore the sound so we can appreciate the historical views of Egyptian locations that no longer exist, and Hollywood at its best.  And while you're at it, give us some special features that show how the story was cleverly adapted from chapter 12 of C. W. Ceram's classic work on archeaology, ""Gods, Graves and Scholars,"" and how Eleanor Parker kept her hat on during the sandstorm.",1166227200,23,3092,4.870229007633588

Robert Taylor is like William Holden but with more muscle and less irony. Another great movie of his is ""Rogue Cop"".

One of the charms of this film is that it takes the mystical dimension of the story seriously, and has a wonderful payoff at the very end.

The characters are well drawn. The ""exotic"" local is filmed perfectly, and puts to shame later efforts to recapture this type of motif. ""King Solomon's Mines"" is also excellent, but there the expedition is approaching through sub-Saharan Africa, so the adventure is African rather than Arab/Egyptian.

The ""ordeal-of-truth"" sword fight that Taylor has to pass among a tribe of marauding bedouin is something to see -- it is *very* realistic.

838668,4,6304308620,"""VALLEY OF THE KINGS"" is another example of classic films whose copy rights are owned by ""TIME WARNER INC."" that like ""Quo Vadis"" and ""Land of the Pharaohs"" are neglected almost to the point of rejection. Still gathering ""Star Dust"" at their ""Warner Bro. Library Vault,"" awaiting for someone there to released them on Anamorphic Widescreen DVD; or like its the case for ""Quo Vadis"" released in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition.

It's a real pity that young film lovers as well as those older ones that have to put up recently with an appalling new ""Alexander,"" can not discover again this terrific picture on DVD. Directed by Robert Piroh, Starring: Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker, it was released on July 23, 1954 as one of the first Cinemascope Movies.

The sceenplay deals with a romantic adventure that centers around the daunting perseverant hunt of an archeologist daughter, searching to find evidence of the Joseph from Biblical times in Egypt, so she can redeem her late father goal on this quest.

Filmed in Egypt it features awesome magnificent scenery of the Great Pyramids as well as other grand archeological sites over there. A terrific movie that needs to be on DVD, specially now that an exibit of King Tutankhamun is touring the USA.

Perhaps by voting on this review, all of you classic film lovers, can remind the mighty ""TIME WARNER INC."" our desire to see this movie released on a DVD format finally.

THANK YOU ALL!",1123200000,79,1481,4.83794466403162

7867528,4,6304308620,"I saw this movie when it was first released in 1954. Even though I was only 8 years old then, I've retained vivid memories of it ever since. I must confess that, even to this day, whenever I see photos of the temple at Abu Simbel, my eyes involuntarily search for the fictitious opening, high in the cliff face near one of the heads of Rameses II, as portrayed in the movie.

A few years ago, I searched for a copy of the movie but was disappointed to learn that it had never been transferred to DVD and the VHS tape was out-of-print. So when I found a used copy of the VHS tape in a store, I picked it up without hesitation. My only disappointment with the VHS tape was that it was in full-frame mode, not widescreen.

When I learned that the movie was now available on DVD in the Warner Brothers Archive Collection, I ordered a copy of it from Amazon. I experienced several disappointments with the DVD. First, it too was in full-frame mode. Second, when I compared the DVD to my VHS tape, the colors on the DVD seemed less intense than on the VHS tape and appeared somewhat ""washed out"". Also, the DVD arrived unsealed and the case was damaged. So I returned the item to Amazon for a replacement copy. The replacement copy arrived sealed, but when I played it, I was surprised to find out that this copy was in widescreen mode! Checking the back of the case for documentation of the aspect ratio, near the bottom I found the following in small hard-to-read letters ""WIDESCREEN 16x9 1.78:1"". So it seems that some copies of this release are in full-frame mode and other copies are in widescreen mode, but Amazon's documentation doesn't reflect that fact.

HOWEVER, BEFORE YOU REPLACE YOUR FULL-FRAME COPY WITH A WIDESCREEN COPY, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:

Before I add my 2 cents worth to the full-frame vs. widescreen controversy over this film, let me state that, for most movies that were filmed in widescreen, I expect the widescreen version to show the maximum amount of the image, while the full-frame version shows less of that image. However, comparing my full-frame copy of Valley of the Kings on VHS tape to the widescreen version on Warner Brothers Archives DVD shows just the reverse! The most obvious evidence for this is that the several times a pyramid appears in the movie, you can see the top of it in the full-frame version, while the top of it is cut off in the widescreen version. Although I don't know this for a certainty, the simplest way to account for this is to assume the movie was originally filmed in the standard full-frame format, but then, prior to release, it was cropped to give it the dimensions (and appearance) of a genuine widescreen movie. The reason for this was to make it competitive with the genuine widescreen movies that were starting to come out then.

I noticed a similar phenomenon in another movie also issued in 1954, ""The Far Country"" starring James Stewart. Near the beginning of that movie, a snow-capped mountain appears. In the full-frame version, you see the complete mountain all the way to the top, but in the widescreen version, the top of the mountain is cut off.

Knowing what I now know, if I was ordering ""Valley of the Kings"" on DVD for the first time, I would opt for the full-frame version, not the widescreen version. Although the widescreen version may be what was ultimately released in the movie theaters in order to make it competitive, I suspect the full-frame version is what the director intended when the movie was being filmed, and I find it more aesthetically satisfying.

I give 4 stars for the widescreen version and 5 stars for the full-frame version. However, I wouldn't pass up this movie because of its aspect ratio. It is high adventure in Hollywood's best tradition.",1512000000,,3754,4.619190404797601

7867534,2,6304308620,"Boy, this one I really didn't like. And this from a diehard Robert Taylor and adventure movies of the Fifties fan. Seemed hacked together in the worst way with almost no plot, really padded out like they all went on a vacation trek though the desert and decided to film it and add narration later to make up a story about what you are seeing. The big action scene (at least until the end) is a ""race"" between lovers' carriages through streets of Cairo.  Lackluster script and portrayals, a ""no director"" feel, topped off by  a muddy, no-one-cared quality to the DVD (meaning scratchy, mushy picture with no restoration attempt). Maybe it was OK new on the big screen but at home what a dud from the start with a decent ending. Big disappointment except -- What is GREAT about this is the Miklos Rosza music score. It's out on CD and was actually the reason I bought the DVD sight unseen. Save the money and buy the soundtrack.",1500076800,,926,4.4733727810650885
