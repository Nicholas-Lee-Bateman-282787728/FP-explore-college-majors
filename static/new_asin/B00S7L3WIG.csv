8697529,3,B00S7L3WIG,"Maybe the story of AM 11:00 reminds you of that of Nacho Vigalondos cult thriller Timecrimes, but the Korean sci-fi thriller has a more straightforward narrative, being less about time travelling than psychological changes that take place in the characters who happen to get a glimpse of their future.

AM 11:00 is about a group of researchers, who have been working on a time-travelling device in an undersea base. To impress the Russian financiers (who are going to back out), two of the researchers volunteer to travel to 11:00 am next day using the still imperfect technology of time machine. What they find in the future is the deserted laboratory that has been destroyed.

As I said, the films story is, after all, about learning what happens to the facilities and the crew, not about time travelling. That means you are to witness how the disaster happens and what happens to each character, but unfortunately this process, which begins in a rather silly way, is not very interesting.

The greatest disappointment about the film is that it offers nothing intelligent about the idea of time travelling and its consequences. Now, you know something terrible will happen at a certain place and at a certain time in the near future, so what will you do? Will you escape from the place and change the course of events? But is that possible if everything is predestined? AM 11:00 ignores these intriguing ideas completely, content with showing the future of stock characters.

Though the film has potential for a more intense thriller, AM 11:00 fails to fully utilize the intriguing premise of the film, which could have been a much more compelling ride.",1437609600,,1655,4.9
