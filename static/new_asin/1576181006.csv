196062,5,1576181006,"This video was very revealing.  A lot of stuff the Clinton's (mostly Bill) would like to keep covered up.
I'm surprised the material in this video is not more widely known or publicized.  Or really I should not
be surprised, as the media controls what is and what isn't.  I'm one who believes it's best to know

196063,5,1576181006,"A must see for another view of Bill Clinton's history. Why has this documentary been hidden from the general public.? Isn't
there room for an honest discussion about these facts in an open forum? I'm getting to the point that I don't believe anything I read or view from the main stream media, no less political manipulators. This could be the beginning of the fall of our country as we know it! As our current administration has stated, they will fundamentally change our country. Is this what we really want?",1359936000,8,510,4.677777777777778
196064,4,1576181006,"What makes this expose interesting, is the challenge issued by the producer in the opening sequences, to the Clinton's to sue him for slander, which would result in giving him the chance to present the documentation in a court of law. That is a lot of confidence in the content. Pretty shocking stuff. American Politics at its worst. The listing of the Clinton's associates and their demises in the credits really put the whole story in perspective. Clinton haters will love it, Clinton fans will hate it, all others will have a new perspective on our political process. Those familiar with the Clinton/Obama ""birther"" problem during their competition for presidential nomination process in 2008 will realize that even these Clinton's can be outdone. Now that's a shocking thought. Hang on for the ride.",1334275200,31,803,5.045112781954887

196066,5,1576181006,"This by far is a very enjoyable, and outstanding investigative political work showing the hidden inside secret workings of President Bill Clinton's life in Arkansas in the early years. I cannot officially label this as a documentary, because like that obese low life bastard Michael Moore's films this movie cannot in anyway really be defined in a documentarial piece mostly due to the fact it was produced by political rivals of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Documentaries have to based on solid facts, and people can come to their own conclusions opinion wise, but this film is more of a themed political based program aimed at folks who are in either the Independent Party camp, GOP, or strict constitutional conservatives who were not a fan of the Democrats or Clinton during the 1990's decade. So thus this movie is a work of art for them, but not a work of art for lunatic Far Leftists nor other average regular people who wouldn't be interested in the subject matter.

But what can be stated about the movie is that it is presented in a documentary format, and for its time although very dated it was made fairly well. A couple of problems did come up in my mind because as a patriotic, traditional, conservative, libertarian, and independent party guy I would have liked to have seen more historical or legal proof of the claims made by those depicted in this video. I want to believe what these witnesses state, but like anything else in a fair and honest court of law I need to see actual evidence to led me toward the direction that what was stated in this video did historically happen.

Plot: A group of former Arkansas workers, lawyers, and state employees including the police state in a documentary testification (or catholic style confession) of secret hidden events regarding then a younger Bill Clinton and his secret inside operations while in charge down in Little Rock.

One man is a legal expert who Bill Clinton gives a job to at a financial state accounting office, who has to work with a private law firm that handles state level business contracts and operations (the Rose Law Firm of Hillary Clinton, Web Hubble, and the late Vince Foster who later commits suicide in an old Civil War park under mysterious circumstances the first year of Bill Clinton's term). The second is a former waitress and strip club employee from Little Rock who worked as Bill Clinton's waitress when he and his associates visited to dine at her restaurant facility.

Third is Arkansas hotel employee Paula Jones, a at the time a younger semi attractive sexually appealing woman Governor Bill Clinton notices and has his employees set up a private meeting with in a fancy Arkansas hotel. A bizarre and deviant themed sexual encounter occurs inside the secret hotel room between Paula Jones and former President Bill Clinton. Allegedly because I do not know if this is true or not, Paula Jones runs away from the room and his horrified by the sexual advances and actions of Clinton, but despite her pleas for help no one bothers to further alleviate her grievance

Forth we have a private investigator and former police officer from Arkansas who was hired to investigate a series of drug, money laundering, smuggling, and violent homicide related crimes under mysterious circumstances. The PI runs into a dead end thrown at him by both Arkansas and Federal police officials after he gains more knowledge of unlawful operations occurring on and around an old airport where Columbian cocaine was being secretly transported (Mena Airport).

In the 1980's, Arkansas experienced two vicious and mysterious deaths of young boys who theoretically slept on train tracks and were run over. I recalled this horrible incident on a popular 80's television show ""Unsolved Mysteries"" with the late Robert Stack, so seeing this again brought that old memory back. Allegedly and according to this documentary, the innocent boys stumbled upon a secret drug smuggling operation where the drug dealing criminals found the boys and tied them to the tracks to murder them. The drug ring was tied to the office of Governor Bill Clinton and other state accounting offices.

Then number five, we have the testimony of two top level Arkansas state troopers who worked as Bill Clinton's bodyguards, driving detail, and personal handlers. According to the now retired state officers, they were ordered directly by Bill Clinton to round up gorgeous young women, and set the ladies up with the Governor for private sexual encounters or secret dates in numerous undisclosed hotel rooms while keeping these sexually themed operations secret from Hillary Clinton. One of these lovely young ladies included one Arkansas model Jennifer Flowers, who in time became President Clinton's secret lover over a long period of time while he was in office. Other young ladies were solicited during this time period, where money and time had been placed on finding out information on these women or if these ladies did engage in relationships with Bill Clinton, state resources were used to accommodate dinners, parties, vacation trips, and sexual encounters all around the state.

What are the negatives about this political insider video? One is we never get an defensive opposing story from Bill Clinton's side, and we do get the account of his former legal and state employee but we do not know if there is a different or sinister agenda on his end to make such extraordinary accusations of terrible criminal actions. Does he want revenge against Bill Clinton?? How much of this story is true?

Second we have the late Jerry Falwell make an appearance on this video, and apparently he was the man behind its production. Falwell was well known as a staunch adversary of Bill Clinton for many years and he was also a Far Right leader on the national political scene who felt in his own way he was defending American culture from, in my view, the nasty destructive policies of the sinister Marxist Radical Left. Falwell unfortunately over time went after any and all political opponents to his national ideals, which included all republicans, independents, and democrats who didn't adhere to his plans for a national American theocracy. There was zero reason for Falwell to even be in this video at all, and even though he was a generally very good but flawed man if Falwell's intent was to show people around the world the truth about Bill Clinton's secret operations then his method should not have included a final message by him, because it distorts the credibility of what was supposed to be a journalistic documentary piece.

What was not mentioned in this was the long, romantic, and sexually erotic relationship between the gorgeous actress Elizabeth Gracen and then Governor Bill Clinton which occurred during his last term in office before his Presidential election. This relationship included romantic encounters at the most luxurious hotels, with erotic and passionate acts of fornication and aggressive sexuality ever engaged in during the history of Arkansas and America.  These erotic sexual encounters had occurred all hidden from both the public, and Hillary Clinton for a very long time period before Gracen had to break off the relationship.  The adulterous love affair between Bill Clinton and Gracen had been one of the most passionate events hidden from the public in the most devious and sinister of ways.

This video is dated, and was made before the embarrassing if not distracting Monica Lewinsky events, plus the horrible events that lead to the rise of Al_Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden with 9-11 and the wars that followed ever since.

I give this film an A- and I as an American did out of curiosity want to know what really occurred during the rise, career, and retirement of President Bill Clinton. If there were serious sexual actions or crimes committed, then we the people must know and hold Hillary Clinton and others accountable for them.",1455408000,10,7926,4.949624060150376

196069,5,1576181006,"Anyone who has worked with or around individuals like Bill Clinton understand their underlying motivations and deceptive personality. The research material featured inside of this DVD is 100% accurate. Bill's profile of deception may be applied to ALL other Presidents, excluding the ones who were assassinated, by the very puppets masters who orchestrated the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations. Here's a hint, it's not the imaginary, Red Herring ""The Illuminati"". The origin of the real perpetrator dates back long before Adam Weishaupt's 1776 Illuminati. Anyone who defends or supports the Clinton family, Bush Family, Obama Family, etc. are either woefully uneducated about the real world, which can be fixed, else they're complicit in the Bush, Clinton and Obama endgame which is a New World Order and One World Religion.
