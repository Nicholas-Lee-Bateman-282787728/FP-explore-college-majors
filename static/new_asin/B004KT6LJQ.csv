It really explains things on a level young children can really understand and inspires them to care for the world around them. My son has even taken the video to daycare to share with his friends. The characters are cute and humorous and the songs are great too! Since watching this video, we've been inspired to do more 'green' things as a family, which has actually helped my son build self confidence, knowing that he's doing something good for the world.",1309910400,,615,4.5

This DVD is about a powerful message that kids should begin to absorb early in life. It's told in a fun and creative way, and it puts a smile on your face at the end of it all, adult or child.",1300579200,,338,4.136363636363637
