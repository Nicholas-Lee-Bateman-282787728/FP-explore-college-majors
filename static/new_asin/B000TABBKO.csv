8208369,5,B000TABBKO,"Benny Hinn is a unique biblical teacher. His approach is very organized and easy to follow while the topics he teaches on are very deep. In this message, Benny talks in detail about each of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians. Hearing this teaching has been very informative and inspiring. I highly recommend it to anyone who has questions about the nine gifts available to believers.",1369440000,,399,4.714285714285714
