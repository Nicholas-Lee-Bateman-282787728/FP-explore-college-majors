7789944,5,0782008585,"This is the pilot episode of Highlander: the series staring Adrian Paul as Ducan Mcleod, cousin of Connor Mcleod. Christopher Lambert does make an appearence in this piece, which he did not do throughout the rest of the TV series, and this ties in nicely to the Endgame Movie, although the connection is not made, the Endgame film does put closure to the question asked in this film: who should and will win between Duncan and Connor.  The first part of this film is good with Connor, but the second show is just extra added on like a second stand alone episode, out of place.  Overall, a good piece of the Highlander history not to be passed up.",1151884800,,646,4.466101694915254
7789945,5,0782008585,"At the time of this writing, someone is trying to sell a USED copy of the VHS edition for 144 bucks... thats outrageous. You can buy a brand new copy of the VHS set for 99 or the DVD edition for 129 on the official Highlander website.. This was a great series, but don't get ripped off.
