8200967,2,B000RJ8YYI,I teach middle school Spanish and our theme was myths and legends. The movie does not have any thing to do with the actual legend. This movie was not interesting or appropiate for my students. I wasted my money.,1321315200,,211,4.435897435897436
8200968,4,B000RJ8YYI,"I am a Native Speaker Spanish teacher in Texas. My students are all Hispanic and have a strong fascination with the legend of ""La Llorona"". They absolutely loved this movie!
It is somewhat low-budget, but the acting is pretty good for a horror film. The ending is not very good, however, because it leaves part of the characters' storyline hanging.
Overall, I would recommend the dvd to anyone who is fascinated by the legend of ""La Llorona"".",1209859200,6,442,4.753246753246753
