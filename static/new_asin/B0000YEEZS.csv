--------------------------------------------------

For those who don't already know, contained on this DVD are stories from the 1987 Saturday morning series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater"".  You wouldn't know that by watching the disc because there are NO SERIES OPENING TITLES and NO SERIES END CREDITS!!!  Yes, you read that correctly.  They left out one of the most significant parts of a television series.  Remember the catchy theme song?  Well, all you'll have are your memories because that theme won't be found here.  There's a credits block on the back of the case that lists the voice actors and major crew, but it doesn't list the minor crew members.  Pity all of the poor animators whose work on the series now goes uncredited.

The series consists of 13 half-hour episodes with 2 stories per episode (26 stories total).  Yet only 25 of the 26 stories appear on these five discs.  Keep in mind that's only 5 stories per each 10.00 disc (that's the original price).  They could have easily fit the entire series onto two dual-layer discs for 20.00.  So not only are you missing a story, and NOT getting the episodes in their original 2-story pairs with the original series opening titles and end credits, but you're being bilked for what little you DO get!

The previous VHS releases in the late 1990s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-of-Paws-VHS/dp/0792838394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard of Paws VHS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitty-The-Beast-VHS/dp/0792838386/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitty & The Beast VHS</a>) were MUCH better than these five DVDs.  Sure they only included four stories each, but they included the series opening titles and end credits, which makes them a vast improvement over these DVDs.  I can only hope that someone at MGM wakes up and re-releases this series as a proper ""complete series"" set, but I doubt that that will ever happen.",1223683200,,3862,7.4298245614035086
1958866,5,B0000YEEZS,"My girls have been asking for a Hello Kitty show for a while and I finally broke down and ordered these titles (Fairy Tales, Princess, Movies). The stories are very cute. The animation so-so. But when these go on, even my 8 year old son will pop in to watch. The episodes are based on classic tales that are ""kitty-fied"" with nothing violent or scary.",1216598400,,351,4.415384615384616
1958867,5,B0000YEEZS,I BOUGHT THIS FOR A VERY YOUNG GIRL AND I BELIEVE SHE IS GOING TO WEAR IT OUT!!!,1207094400,,80,3.5
1958868,4,B0000YEEZS,"The cartoons are from the 1980's Hello Kitty tv series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater,"" which are variations on popular fairy tales/movies. They feature Hello Kitty, My Melody, Tuxedo Sam, Chip, Catnip & Grinder, who are actors in the theatre.  Each DVD contains 5 fairy tales, and each fairy tale is about 10 minutes long and has its own unique take on the familiar stories.  They are also changed to be less violent, nicer and more suited for children (water balloon fights instead of guns).

The quality of the DVD's are more like TV broadcast quality and this is the reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5. I think they could've enhanced the quality before putting it onto DVD. It is also not recorded in stereo sound. I already owned the 2 Furry Tale Theater VHS's (Kitty and the Beast, The Wizard of Paws), so I already knew what to expect.

I'm an adult Sanrio collector and I loved seeing these episodes, and I would feel good about letting my children see these too.

The following is the list of the episodes in this DVD:
""Hello Kitty Tells Fairy Tales"" has Robin Penguin, Hello Mother Goose, The Ugly Quackling, Pinocchio Penguin, and Little Red Bunny Hood.

My favorite is Little Red Bunny Hood... I think My Melody is very cute in it!",1119398400,6,1253,4.571428571428571
1958869,2,B0000YEEZS,"Contrary to another review, this did not contain the same stories the kids wanted, such as CinderKitty and Snow White kitty.  Nor did it contain The Phantom of the Theater, Frankencat, Catula, The Pawed Piper and Rumpeldogskin as indicated in another review.  Check carefully if you are looking for a specific Kitty DVD.",1117152000,,320,5.018867924528302

8004448,3,B0000YEEZS,Overall this is a nice hello kitty dvd. the 4th fairy tale on the list had problems from the start and would freeze while playing. This was with the disk being brand new out of the package no marks or scratches on the disk. All the other ones played ok.,1441756800,,253,4.08
