8465918,2,B005CVFZ20,"Wendall (Kevin Phillips/ Kevin George) witnesses the killings of both his parents on the eve of their leaving town. The killer used a crowbar and wore a welder's mask. A decade later Alex (Michael Ray Clark) and Ronnie (Natasha Timpani) move into said house and the killings start all over again. The town and neighbors are overly apathetic to the situation.

The opening credits was tough to sit through with an annoying sound track. The photo of the dead/barren tree makes it way from the opening credit to throughout the film. Most likely a symbol of the barren Aunt who is introduced late. The film had a couple of good characters, neighbor Nancy (Elizabeth Schrey) being one of them.

Overall the plot was one we have seen too many times. They tried too hard to create good support characters, they failed to create decent main characters.  The killer is apparently dragging around a smoke machine as they over did that effect.

1 1/2 stars. Written and directed by Scott Phillips who was a Russian soldier extra in the original ""Red Dawn.""

And he has this ability to just come out of nowhere & scare the living *&^% out of you!  I'm positive this one's going to eventually become a classic on its own, as it should.",1383177600,,326,4.311475409836065

8465921,5,B005CVFZ20,Loved the movie.  Then again I must admit I'm a bit biased being related to one of the supporting actors.  It is a fun movie to watch in several aspects besides that.  The music for the most part is excellent and helps set the mood.  Natasha did an excellent job as well as Elizabeth Schrey who played the part of Nancy the neighbor.  Not bad for a first film by Scott.,1353283200,2,369,4.140845070422535
8465922,3,B005CVFZ20,"The title tells you what to expect and I wasn't disappointed on that score.  It's Amityville meets Texas Chainsaw with a little Stephen King/Shirley Jackson/creepy rustic village thrown in.  What I didn't expect were the classy production values--nice lighting, camera work and makeup/effects far beyond the otherwise obviously modest budget.  I was happy to get away from the standard handheld look and thrilled to see an actual dolly being used.  The wide-angle shots and overall style gets pretty wild at times, which sometimes works but not always.  That goes for the acting, directing and writing as well--bold and brave but sometimes just too much and too on the nose.  I'd also cut some of the early ""scenic"" shots short--they felt like filler to me and unnecessary since the film is 10 minutes over the standard 90-minute feature anyway.

The long-chord music style seems a little old and I could have used less of the ""indie piano background"" too, but the rest of the soundtrack is top-notch.

A crowbar is a pretty nasty weapon, but worse is if the whole neighborhood is in on the killings, or maybe even worse is if they just don't care.  The villain wears a welding mask and Leatherface's old apron, which is plenty scary, especially when the light flares off that mask.  The back-story legend that underpins the killings lends a gruesome, unrelenting inevitability to the proceedings.

All in all, still a horror film but one with higher aspirations, and well-worth watching.",1320796800,3,1488,4.983805668016195
8465923,3,B005CVFZ20,"A little boy has a traumatic event happen to his parents (Nooo,Not HARRY POTTER),More like Michael Myers sister in Classic Halloween movie.

Why years later his Ghost ? Doppelganger ? or Copycat is wearing a welders helmet and Leather apron  to off people boggles me.

Forgot title detail the parents were killed with a crow bar,Get it,And now whoever moves into their family home is offed with a crow bar.

The suspense,Like mentioned is very classic in theme and rare these days.

There are some truly scary moments and bits of acting from Michael Ray Clark.

I wonder if Harbor Freight Tools knows how some of there products are used ,In none standard ways ?",1320192000,2,661,4.7043478260869565
