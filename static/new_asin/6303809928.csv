7853034,4,6303809928,"One of the hazards of catching films at International Film Festivals is that what a lot of critics may consider artistic, I find dreary and pedantic. There are many critically acclaimed directors who seem to thrive on boring the audience to death.

But among the arty-farty films, there are a few that sticks in my mind and these I consider good. If years later I can still recall scenes and plots, I think the film has made an impact.

Firecracker is one such film for me. The pace is not blockbuster pacing, but the story is one of duty and obligation in conflict with passion and love; of the responsibility one has to one's family and the people who depend on the family, and one's desire to be free to pursue one's desire.

On the other hand is the story of one man reaching beyond his station, and being all he can or want to be. To reach for the unreachable and being willing to meet death or worse, for his dream.

The climax is explosive, but the fuse burns long.

And the denouement may not satisfy all (if you read the other reviews).

But 10 years or so after watching the movie, I still remember it fondly.

Not a Disney ending.

Now if only it weren't $155...",1201219200,6,1173,4.348623853211009
7853035,3,6303809928,"One of my many recent excursions to the Foreign section at the video store found what I hoped would yet further encourage my new love for Chinese  film.  Not having much experience with them before, I was delighted that  there was more to it than Bruce Lee. After saturating myself with Gong Li  movies, I took home ""Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker"", and  fell in love with it right up to the end.  I felt I had been cheated, that  it was a cop-out. Every time he went away, either she ran after him or he  ran back to her.  Cinematic, sensual, and romantic, this film still  disappointed.  There was no right answer for this couple's predicament, and  there was no compromise...  on anyone's part.  I want to give this movie  two ratings.  For the entire movie up to the last four minutes, The movie  can have 4 stars.  For the ending, the movie can have 1 star.",966816000,5,866,4.407643312101911
7853036,2,6303809928,"The best aspect of this movie is the location and the scenery.  Beautiful  filming but a plot with too many blanks and questions.  I won't give away  the ending but it was stupid and by that time I didn't care what happened  to the hero.  I usually love Chinese dramas but this one missed with its  plot of unrequited love being dragged out too long, and not making much  sense.",962668800,3,378,4.3
