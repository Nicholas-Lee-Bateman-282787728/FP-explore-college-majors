8250347,1,B0013DI4EM,I bought this (not through Amazon) and the DVDs do not even play.  I just played some other DVDs fine.  Put these in and they do not work.,1294444800,,138,3.892857142857143
8250348,3,B0013DI4EM,"The 5.1 audio is barely noticeable. The surround speakers are rarely active and when they are it's subtle. Since most of it is dialogue in documentary style, it almost sounds mono. It barely sounds like it is in stereo. The video quality is excellent. The stories are not that interesting. Also, unless you plan on viewing this in one setting which I doubt since it is over 9hrs long, don't count on using the episode selection menu. The episode titles are matched to the wrong episodes so you are constantly jumping around the menu trying to figure out which episode you haven't watched. This is already available at Best Buy as of this writing.  It's not worth repeat viewings.",1212364800,4,679,4.705882352941177
