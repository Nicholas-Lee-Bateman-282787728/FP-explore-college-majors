7966774,5,B00006B1HM,"My girls (5 and 2) love Little Bill.  This past Christmas, we bought our girls the Nick Jr. Christmas DVD for a long car trip.  Although I thought I would lose my mind with the other two stories that played over and over, I could watch the Little Bill episode everyday. Good thing, because I think we have watched it 500,000 times.
 The most amazing thing about the Little Bill stories,is that Bill Cosby has brought ""every child"" experiences to a child that just happens to be African American.  Any child can watch these and say, ""Hey, that kid is just like me!""  What a wonderful gift!
 I dare anyone not to get choked up as Little Bill and Alice the Great sing the Christmas Star song over the phone.  I also dare anyone not to cheer on Little Bill as he races to get his most important Christmas wish to Santa in time.  Will Santa get to Alice the Great home in time for Christmas? I'll let you watch and see.",1078358400,5,914,4.273255813953488
7966775,5,B00006B1HM,"THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! Bill Cosby for creating such a wonderful series of books and videos. Last year while pregnant with our first child I began to look for books and videos that were educational and entertaining which she  could watch. So we were quite ecstatic when we came across Little Bill one Saturday morning (Saturdays at 8:30 a.m. Channel 2). Since that day we have purchased every Little Bill book (every series, there are a few) and video. We even have the Little Bill doll. Our daughter has been watching and enjoying Little Bill since she was four months old. She looks forward to Little Bill every day. Already she is familiar with the opening jazz number.
If you looking for a book/video series that is both educational and entertaining that you both can enjoy (where you don't have to worry about the content) THIS IS IT. It has something for both the child and the parent (the jazz touch is great, like Bugs Bunny with the classical music). Not too mention the familiar voices of Ruby Dee, Phylicia Rashad, Gregory Hines, etc.)
We just purchased the Merry Christmas, Little Bill video. The first one will pull at your heartstrings, the second and third are just a fun look at children and their imaginations.
Parents will find themselves wanting to watch Little Bill almost as much as the child. I agree with reviewer Karl W Berner, it is the most entertaining and delightful children's television show airing today.",1038787200,8,1450,4.776892430278885
