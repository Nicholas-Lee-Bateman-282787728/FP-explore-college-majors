8218842,2,B000VIFKU6,"I got this DVD because it contained City Of The Walking Dead.  That is an alternate title for Nightmare City.  This DVD does have 2 movies on 1 disc, BUT they're BOTH on the same side.  This means the compression is super high and thus the quality is very low.  What they should have done was create a flipper, with a movie on each side.

As I said, I got this DVD for a specific movie, only to discover it's incomplete!  The end continues past the ending credits with the ending theme playing over a black screen.  Whoever did the authoring thought the black screen meant the end of the movie and did not watch the source material to compare and make sure he did it right.  Thus, the ending theme ends abruptly as the DVD ends.

So, I can't recommend this DVD over Nightmare City on DVD.",1310169600,2,788,4.27027027027027
