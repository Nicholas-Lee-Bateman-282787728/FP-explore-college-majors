2562448,5,B000FEILBG,"Thoroughly enjoyable! It's a fish out of water story, with Alexander Fu Sheng trying to survive in a turbulent world defiled by mob corruption.  If anyone has seen Fu Sheng in The Disciples of Shaolin, the plot of Chinatown Kid will seem very familiar, except the film takes place in modern 1970's America. Fans of the Venom mob will enjoy seeing Philip Kwok, Lo Mang, Sun Chien, and Lu Feng in a film before their internationally famous Five Deadly Venoms.  Together they all act beside Fu Sheng in one of his timeless roles, that remind us all that he left the world way too soon.  For all fans of Alexander Fu Sheng this film is a definite must see!",1380067200,,652,4.46218487394958

2562453,3,B000FEILBG,"Saw this on a Kung Fu fest when I was about 12 years old, and thought it was an incredible display of Kung Fu skill, in a gritty world where gangs of Kung Fu masters contended to rule their territories.

A revisit shows it hasn't aged TOO badly. Alexander Fu Sheng was a rising star in the chop-socky film world, a life ended too young. Would have been interesting to see where he could have gone with it, in ""Chinatown Kid"", he's a likable country bumpkin adrift in the big city.

The transfer is terrible, source materials were likely hard to come by. The bonus trailers are hilarious.",1319846400,,587,4.425925925925926

2562455,4,B000FEILBG,"On Labor day weekend in 1977, several people were shot at the Golden Dragon Restaurant on Washington Street at Grant Avenue in San Francisco's Chinatown. This was the result of a war between two youth gangs. The Wah Cheng gang was based in Chinatown centered on Grant, and Joe Fong's Boys were based in New Chinatown centered on Clement across town. Some Joe's Boys tried to shoot some of the Wah Cheng but hit innocent bystanders. Next weekend, some Wah Cheng went to New Chinatown and shot some Joe's Boys. Thus did the war continue all through September 1977. I knew one of the founders of the Wah Cheng, and I saw two shooting episodes, since I lived about 2.5 blocks from ""Gum Long-Chin Lung (Golden Dragon)"" then. Chinatown was soon deserted by tourists, and it was unusual to see that. It was big news in Chinatown when Shaw Brothers decided to make a movie loosely based upon this gang war. Fu Sheng, aka Alexander Fu starred, and the female leads Shao Yin-Yin and Yu Sai-Li both resembled my girlfriend Chu Bi-Zhen. I love this movie, even if it has little resemblance to the real people involved. It is a better story however. I recommend adding it to your collection, and when you do, be aware it was inspired by a real series of events.",1300233600,,1248,4.551111111111111
2562456,3,B000FEILBG,"I just wanted people to know that the Forum Home Video version of Chinatown Kid runs at 88 minutes, not 115 min.  Also, it's full screen.  Basically its the same source as the Ground Zero DVD.",1264377600,,192,4.305555555555555
2562457,2,B000FEILBG,"I've been looking for a good version of this film for quite a while, since Celestial Films didn't find it worthwhile to provide the English speaking world English-dubbed Shaw Brothers DVDs. In any event, I've found great satisfaction with the Red Sun DVDs. That is, until I got this one.

The DVD box will tell you that the film is the uncut version. That is true. The video and sound quality on the other hand is HORRID. I would hesitate to say if it's even VHS-quality (which is probably where this transfer came from).

So I will say this to anyone thinking about getting this DVD...it's the full movie. Uncut and unedited. But be warned...the video and sound quality will leave you cold.",1236297600,,691,4.609756097560975

2562459,1,B000FEILBG,Do NOT buy this DVD as the transfer is HORRENDOUS. I bought it earlier but returned it because of the terrible picture quality. Alexander Fu Sheng's classic flick deserves better than this!,1023321600,,189,4.9375
2562460,4,B000FEILBG,"THE CHINATOWN KID (1977) is an excellent showcase for one of the greatest kung fu stars of the 1970s, Alexander Fu Sheng. It also introduced audiences to the five actors who would come to be known collectively as the Five Venoms, following the success of their first starring film, FIVE DEADLY VENOMS (1978).
CHINATOWN KID is set mostly in America, in San Francisco's Chinatown, although it was shot at Hong Kong's Shaw Bros. Studio on sets which may not convince many viewers. However, the film tells an exciting rise-and-fall gangster story filled with short, but spectacular, kung fu brawls set in the streets, clubs and gyms of Chinatown. Fu Sheng plays a mainland Chinese refugee in HK who flees to the U.S. to escape the wrath of an angry triad boss after rescuing a girl from his prostitution ring. The boss, played by Wang Lung Wei, eventually arrives in S.F. as well, forcing a showdown that soon escalates to involve two rival Chinatown gangs. Thanks to his courage, cockiness and kung fu skills, Fu Sheng rises up within the underworld but his conscience gets the best of him after a Taiwanese student he had befriended gets hooked on heroin. This leads to an all-out battle with the gang that had taken him in.
In addition to Fu Sheng, the major kung fu performers on hand include Wang Lung Wei and three future Venoms, Kuo Chui, Sun Chien and Lo Meng. (The other two, Chiang Sheng and Lu Feng, have smaller roles.) The film's production design captures the wonderfully garish costumes and interior dcor of mid-1970s American taste, making it a very different-looking kung fu film. In fact, it feels more like an American gangster movie and looks forward particularly to Brian De Palma's SCARFACE (1983).",1006646400,,1716,4.820338983050847

8121573,5,B000FEILBG,"Excellent movie that had a decent story and well choreographed kung-fu for the time of 1977.  The story is about two guys, one from Taiwan and one from Hong Kong.  Both around the same age, but the one from Taiwan is educated middle class and the one from Hong Kong is uneducated poor class.  Both are struggling to be good people, and they both end up meeting in San Francisco's Chinatown (USA) while in search of a job.  The educated arrived via a college scholarship while the uneducated one arrived illegally via a ship because he was on the run from the HK police after he was framed by a gang member for possession of cocaine.

The two young men became best friends as they had no other friends as immigrants to a new environment and culture.  They both, however, have excellent kung-fu skills as the one from Hong Kong actually came from rural China knowing only martial arts while the Taiwanese guy had previously served in the army.  As best friends, the uneducated one would always take the blame when there was trouble as he cared so much about the educated one.  While one suffered through school and work, the other suffered by unknowingly joining a gang and being disrespected for his association with the gang.  Though he climbed the economic social ladder via short term success as a gang member, he once again takes the blame at the end and his life falls apart quickly while his educated friend becomes presumably successful over the long-term from his education.  The moral of the story at the end is education is most important in climbing the economic social ladder.

Dubbed in English with subtitles if you turn on closed caption.",1484179200,,1652,4.662068965517242

8121575,4,B000FEILBG,This is a shortened version of the film. I did enjoy it. It was only an hour and a half even though it should be closer to two hours. Alexander Fu Sheng is a delight and there is Proto-Venom appearances from all of the Venom mob. I would prefer the original. The scenes depicting San Francisco are interesting but not accurate. It's still a great Kung fu flick.,1482624000,,361,4.323529411764706
8121576,3,B000FEILBG,"Great film. Bad transferred DVD. I actually see a spot where you see ""VIDEO"" onscreen like someone started a tape to digitize.

Hopefully this good movie will get a proper release/re-master.  I will let this tidy me over until then. Oh one bonus, the trailers on the DVD are EPIC.
Actually they deserve an extra star for the grindhouse 70s style trailers included.",1473897600,,364,4.761904761904762
8121577,3,B000FEILBG,"A word of warning...my copy was obviously NOT an original dvd. The dvd cover is a color photocopy of the Shaw Brothers original cover, and the round sticker over the dvd was also a color photocopy. Just a word of warning.

It is obviously a VHS or bad dvd dub onto a dvd disk. Aside from that, the movie is great. Just like it was when it first came out in the mid to late 1970's.

Three stars for having the dvd copy available, fully uncut. Two stars off for not letting anyone know this is a dvd copy.",1455926400,,503,4.070707070707071
8121578,5,B000FEILBG,"This film has become kind of infamous but not because of the subject.  When Shaw Brothers sold the rights to their film library in the early 2000s some expensive remastering was done of all but a small number of very badly damaged films.  Chinatown Kid was remastered and while consumers were generally happy with the clean up, the remastered version is about 30 minutes shorter than the version here.  Nobody knows why.  It's known that some Shaw Brothers films were subjected to slightly different cuts for different markets.  For example, Japan asked for more violence and sex.  Some countries wanted less sex and/or violence.  There are reports that for a small number of films, if the cuts were so great as to damage the story, Shaw Brothers would grab a staff director and whatever actors from the film were on hand and shoot bridge sequences of a few minutes to fill in the cuts.  So differences of as much as a few minutes are known in versions produced for different markets, but nobody knows why there is a 30 minute difference in the version on this DVD and the official remastered version sold in Asia.  Not only were there massive cuts in the Asia version, there are several major scene differences and the endings are completely different.  Many of the people involved in the film have since died (both the director and main star are dead) and it's just been too long for anybody to remember what happened here.  Shaw Brothers worked at a breakneck pace around this time and so many films were in production at one time that anybody still alive from this film probably can't separate it from any of the other films being made at the same time.  So we'll very likely never know why a massively cut version was produced and what it was intended for.  The current rights holders were completely at a loss to explain the differences on this film and said that the shorter version submitted for remastering is the only version they have on hand.

I don't see a need to go over the plot in detail.  Basically a young guy (Fu Sheng) gets in trouble with the Hong Kong mafia and escapes to San Francisco using forged documents.  He gets a job in a Chinatown restaurant and has adventures.  There is a very small amount of true location shooting in San Francisco where the 2 main actors appear to have truly gone for a quick shoot, but the film probably spent one day or at most two actually in San Francisco for filming.  Almost all of this takes place on a Shaw Brothers sound stage, including almost all ""San Francisco"" scenes.  Particularly amusing to me are the scenes at the hot dog stand where the sign gives the prices in ""US dollars"" because as we all know, American restaurants do that all the time (That's a joke).  Also you might note the ""American"" cars with steering wheels on the right side just like in Hong Kong.  But the film certainly has its charms and is enjoyable even if there's almost no real location (San Francisco) shooting in it.

The film is widescreen but it's in a 4:3 window.  It's not anamorphic 16:9.  If you don't know what that means, then don't worry about it.  Despite some claims of sound problems, my copy was fine.  The bonus trailers were fascinating to me and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them.  The only language on this film is English.  There are no subtitles.  I'm sure that a VHS English dub was the source of this DVD, but given the rarity of the uncut version and how the odds are almost zero that the current rights holder is ever going to care enough to try to find the missing footage this DVD has, I do recommend this for Shaw Brothers fans or kung fu fans in general.  Look for Kara Hui's appearance as a call girl rescued by Fu Sheng's character.  This was one of her very earliest film appearances.  Also look for Jenny Tseng, Fu Sheng's wife in real life, as Yvonne.  I'd have preferred the film in Cantonese or Mandarin with English subs as the English dubbing is pretty corny, as is usual for the era, but having the long version available makes up for that.",1455753600,,4024,4.521438450899032
