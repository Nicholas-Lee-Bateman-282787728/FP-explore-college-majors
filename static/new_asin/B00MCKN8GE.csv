8671658,5,B00MCKN8GE,I have the book.  This is great stuff.  But I agree with another reviewer.  Get this out on DVD for Region 1 so the rest of us can see it.  Hurry up.,1449878400,,149,3.5625

8671663,3,B00MCKN8GE,"So I haven't watched this.  I really want to, but as was the case with Wonders of Life, there is no official US release.  Perhaps Wonders of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe weren't big sellers here in the US. However, at least with Wonders of Life there was an option to purchase the instant video version.  Not ideal, but was the only way I could ""own"" and watch the series.  However, looks like that has been dropped for this series leaving one big Brian Cox fan without a way to even see this series.  Please consider at least giving us that option, not sure what else to do.  Considered buying it from the UK site (who has instant video) but not sure I would be able to view it.

3 star rating because of the release policy of this show.  I'm sure the content is a 5, but I guess I'll never know.",1434931200,8,813,4.166666666666667
8671664,5,B00MCKN8GE,"Loved this!  Professor Cox explains complex processes with ease.  To understand the world and universe around us, makes it feel more like being a part of the whole.  I would strongly recommend this for anyone that wants to 'know more'.",1425513600,2,235,4.825
8671665,5,B00MCKN8GE,"Human Universe follows in the footsteps of Wonders Of The Solar System and Wonders of the Universe. This explorers the human condition and how it relates to the world.  Really enjoyed all the various (and unpredictable) places he explores and focus's on. The music, amazing graphics and global locations he explorers bring together his ideas.
Looks GREAT on a decent blue ray system.",1423785600,3,383,5.079365079365079
