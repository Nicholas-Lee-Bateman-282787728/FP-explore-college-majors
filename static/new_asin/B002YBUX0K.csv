Trust me it is better than getting the box set in the cute little case because the disc in that set do not work, it is much better purchasing them this way.

4012805,4,B002YBUX0K,"Will & Grace was a show about gays, as performed by mostly straight actors.  The show helped to perpetuate gay stereotypes in a manner that was hardly positive.  Viewership plummeted in the declining years of the show (from their glory days of a 17.3 million viewers to a measly 8.7 million).  The final season was riddled with the intrusion of political jibes, altering their claim of having no hidden agenda.  The problem with making a show political is that you pin it to a specific time and a specific subject, a reference that only applies at that one particular moment in history.  Theres a reason people no longer refer to the Teapot Dome scandal.  Comedy should be based on something universal, something that can be understood and appreciated years later.  Spewing hatred for a specific political party automatically alienates those viewers.  No one is going to want to watch a show that scorns their beliefs.  Towards the end of their run, Will & Grace had turned quite nasty and not a little smug in their obvious liberal bias.

I prefer to remember this show for the fun years (the first, through season six) before the series creators were sued and fired.  Its not surprising that viewers began to tune out this show in the last three years.  I particularly hated the series rushed finale where they clumsily tried to wrap everything up in an unsatisfactory fashion.

My favorite member of the cast remains Megan Mullally as Karen Walker.",1498435200,,1451,4.80241935483871

4012820,5,B002YBUX0K,"First off: to say that Im a huge Will & Grace fan would be an understatement. In fact this is the only sitcom that manages to make me laugh out loud several times per episode, even though I must have watched all 194 episodes more than 8 times already. Needless to say that Id like to enjoy my favourite sitcom in perfect picture quality on my flat screen TV  preferably with English subtitles.
As I already own the UK Boxset Im aware that this release is everything but perfect and therefore not satisfying at all. The lack of subtitles for the majority of seasons is frustrating, the picture quality often too grainy, bonus features apart from a couple of clips almost non-existent. So thats why I was really hoping for a better release of this series!

I recently came across the German release of the complete series of Will & Grace by Koch Media and wanted to share what I found out:

---------------------------
Now lets compare the UK Boxset to the German release:

Subtitles:
The UK release only features subtitles for Seasons 3  5 in yellow letters
The German release on the other hand features subtitles for ALL(!) 8 Seasons in white letters!

Aspect ratios as following:
UK:
Seasons 1-5 in 1.33:1 [4:3]
Seasons: 6-8 in 1.78:1 [16:9]

German release:
Seasons 1 & 2 in 1.33:1 [4:3]
Seasons 3-8 in 1.78:1 [16:9]

Bonus Disc Content:

The UK Box features the unedited episode (2-parts) Cheaters, an Audio commentary for the finale episode and lots of different clips taken from various episodes.

German Boxset bonus features including the unedited episode (2-parts) of Cheaters and following previously unreleased featurettes:

-  the last great sitcome standing: 55 minute-long interviews with the creators of the show
-  Will on Will & Grace: Interview with Eric McCormack (44 minutes)
-  Ross King on the set: Ross King interviews cast on the set of Will & Grace (24 minutes)

> Gag reels for almost every season are included on the individual episode discs
---------------------------
German Boxset:
As you can see the German company Koch Media has managed to achieve what Universal was too lazy to do:

- subtitles for all seasons
- interesting aspect ratio for nowadays flat screen tvs
- exclusive bonus content

Unfortunately the mediocre to at times really bad picture quality remains the same. At times blurry, at times grainy  there doesnt seem to be a single episode (not even from seasons 6-8) offering a perfect picture quality. Im aware that this is a DVD and not a blu-ray release, although the bad video quality raises the question of how bad the actual source must be  especially since other sitcoms that were produced around the same time as W&G just like friends, king of queens and others have already been released in pretty decent picture quality on blu-ray  whereas such a release of W&G probably will probably never happen.

Either way: I can highly recommend the German release of Will & Grace by Koch Media, which is not only the most complete but also the release who manages to pay tribute to such a unique sitcom and their amazing cast the best  to date!

---------------------------
Side note:
Master / Source: After contacting them I got to find out that Koch Media used their own master for their release. Unfortunately I wasn't able to receive more specific informations regarding the source / master.

This is a Region 2 locked DVD, the discs are stacked into cardboard sleeves (so you might want to place them into DVD cases), the episodes titles in german language can be found beneath the individual discs (see attached pictures).

4012824,4,B002YBUX0K,"Always loved this series, and now we get to watch them in order and as many times was we want forever. Revised review: 1/04/17After attempting to watch all eight seasons I concur with others who have downgraded the DVDs' quality. There were certain discs in which the last four episodes on the disc were not THERE. The arrow pointing to the next chapter was MISSING. Also rather annoying was the fact that many discs began playing immediately on the same episode (not always the first one either) instead of taking you directly to the MENU. In all, the tech aspects of the DVDs was average at best. And we were playing these on a recent Blu-ray machine so I don't think it was our problem. Finally, by watching all the episodes (at two or three per day), one can see how the show weakens in the latter years. The four stars, particularly Eric McCormack, are superb, hold the show together, but the writing really weakens toward the end.",1471564800,,936,4.5773809523809526

I didn't even know they made the seasons in a standard DVD box with all discs stacked on each other. I'm a little disappointed as I was expected all of the sets in the paper-box style packages with the pull out DVD holders. Only Season 6 is in the packaging I was hoping for (purely to display the collection on a shelf).

I will certainly report back if there is a problem. So far, the only complaints I have about the product is this...I bought the entire season and they were NOT in a nice box ""set"" that held ALL of the dvd's. Each individual season is inside a cardboard box. Also, each season discs are in a standard case that does not have individual slide protective ""slots"" for each disc...they are stacked on top of each other. What the heck is that all about? That cheapens the entire product. Whoever planned that out really needs never be in charge of this kind of decision making again.

4012982,5,B002YBUX0K,We enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2 especially because we had access to English subtitles.  We are now into Season 3 and NO English subtitles are available.  The lines are delivered very quickly and having the subtitles available made viewing much more fun and enjoyable.  We recommend that English subtitles be added to the other seasons.,1388880000,2,328,4.927272727272728

4012985,3,B002YBUX0K,"My fault for missing the fact that there was 5 DVDs and 3 video TAPES in the package. The price and choice was fine and I received them quickly, BUT I  sure missed the way the bundle was shown
Again my fault and I will be more observant",1388275200,2,236,3.9166666666666665
4012986,5,B002YBUX0K,"I viewed the discs again and found that the problem was my misunderstanding of how the main menu (arrow) worked in the program lineup.  What I was doing was highlighting main menu then pressing the run button which would take me all the way back to the main menu.  So instead, I highlighted main menu then pressed directional button to highlight the direction arrow, pressed on/run button.  That did the trick!

Sorry for misleading anyone w/the previous review.

This product is very satisfactory other than that I am critical of the lineup layout--it could have been designed better in my opinion but that's not your fault.

I am enjoying watching W&G continuously w/o having to wait for the next program to appear on TV.

Thank you.",1388188800,,735,4.785714285714286

4012990,5,B002YBUX0K,"Disclaimer: avid fan writing this review. I faithfully watched W&G when it first aired on TV, not quite believing that a major network show could be built around gay characters. Having just come out several years prior, I longed to see positive GLBT role models (especially, after living through Don't Ask, Don't Tell and Defense of Marriage enactments). Everything about this show just screams ""quality"": writing is superb, humor is nuanced yet relatable, and characters are simply hilarious. After not seeing this show for many years (ever since it went off air), I was so happy I could buy the entire 8 seasons all at once. Needless to say, I just re-watched the entire show in one week!",1381449600,,690,4.8559322033898304

4013003,5,B002YBUX0K,Will and Grace still lives up it's memory even so many years after the show has ended. The comedy still has relevance and will keep you laughing for years to come. which shows that good writing is hard to do and when done properly does not go out of style. I know some people have reported having issues with the disks but I am almost through with season one and have yet to have a problem. So fingers crossed. : ) Overall I've been really happy with this purchase.,1373155200,2,465,4.235955056179775

4013021,1,B002YBUX0K,"This review is about the product not the content.
1.  It is an assemblage of seasons that differ dramatically in quality and content.  I am especially disconcerted about the absence of CC or subtitles for Seasons 3-4 and maybe others though Seasons 1-2 have captioning and the product was marketed as having captions.
2.  Having viewed half of the set at least three DVDs have recording flaws or physical flaws.  Unsure which since the discs pixelate badly or stick and viewing stops.

I would not purchase this product unless you are a die-hard fan, not hard of hearing, and willing to start and stop the play from time to time.",1357689600,13,629,4.681818181818182
