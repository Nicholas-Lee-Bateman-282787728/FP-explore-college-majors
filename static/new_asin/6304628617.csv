7875377,5,6304628617,"One of the most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music...the Hoppy series produced by Harry ""Pop"" Sherman is arguably the best ""B"" western series ever made...its production values were miles above any other and they always had the look and feel of more expensive ""A"" features...Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character ""Hopalong Cassidy"" came to life through the producing of Harry ""Pop"" Sherman and the realistic performance of William Lawrence Boyd...as Hoppy aims to do some trailing for cattle rustlers, clean up a wild town and save the under-dog...always filmed in the great outdoors of Lone Pine, California at the foothills of Mount Whitney, beautiful photography is exceptional for a ""B"" product.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitch rack, chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes, even William Boyd.

In this Volume Four we have five films of the following:

Hoppy's interaction with Windy Halliday (George ""Gabby"" Hayes) and California Carlson (Andy Clyde) was always a shot in the arm with their down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment...Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of five films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys...just the way we like 'em.

7875378,4,6304628617,"Film historian Francis Nevins was certainly correct when he described the six Hopalong Cassidy films of 1943-44, the last under producer Harry 'Pop' Sherman, as the finest in the history of the series ( and all up, 66 of them would be made between 1935-48).
Glorious scenery including snow-capped mountains, prairies, rocky outcrops, rustic ranch-houses, combined with good storyline, rousing chases and background music makes 'Riders of the Deadline' another great Cassidy film-and William Boyd, as Hoppy, was surely the best of all the old B grade western stars.
Basically this film sees a young man killed soon after joining the Texas Rangers. The youth had owed money to a crooked banker but refused to 'look the the other way' to have the debt cancelled. When he is shot Hoppy, a senior Ranger, pretends to turn outlaw in order to find out who was responsible for ordering the death of his young friend.
There is also a great and imaginative gun fight, around the tellers cage in the bank, as a climax to this film.
 ""Deadline"" was also the last time Robert Mitchum played in a Cassidy flick, (and in those days he was called Bob in the credits). Once again, as a villain, he gets slugged by Hoppy-on more than one occasion.
The Cassidy films always had lavish budgets, particularly in this ninth year of production, and this one was budgeted at $106,000, a small fortune for that era.
For anyone wanting to see the best of the old B western genre-a  integral part of American film history- then this film, like most of the  Hopalong Cassidy adventures, will not disappoint.
Bill Boyd epitomises the best of American values as Hoppy - decency, strength, a willingness to help the weak, kindness, moral fibre etc, all attributes that Boyd brought to his real life, after becoming Hopalong.  Boyd ,(like another rising young actor of the period, John Wayne), may not have been a natural horseman but he had that indefinable star quality that compensated for any initial drawback in the role.
If you remember with affection the old Saturday matinees then relive your youth with this great Cassidy video-and if you are a youth today then watch how they used to make 'em and saddle-up with Hoppy for a great 72 minutes of action.",997660800,2,2229,4.796875
