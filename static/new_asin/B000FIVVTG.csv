It features lots of different dogs in various music videos with the kids. My favorite is ""Walking the Dog"" with a huge, but gentle, Great Dane!",1290297600,,251,4.361702127659575
2569521,5,B000FIVVTG,"I have the Kidsongs VHS collection that I played for my children. I took that same sollection and introduced them to children in the classroom. What a great learning tool!! The videos introduce the children to topics that the teacher talks and teaches about and gives them music to remember it by. There are so many cartoons out that children don't want to see another cartoon video but with kidsongs kids, they are real children their age. Wonderful tool for a classroom teacher.",1152748800,,480,4.795180722891566

8123513,5,B000FIVVTG,"We owned the VHS version of this DVD for years. I think we bought it in the late 1980s. This series was one of my first born's favorites. When her little guy hit 2 years old and began saying ""TRK"" (truck) every single time he saw one --- and she lives in Texas --- she asked if we had a DVD copy. After looking on amazon, I ordered and sent the new DVD copy directly to her house. I became a heroine to both of them.",1355961600,,416,3.8488372093023258
