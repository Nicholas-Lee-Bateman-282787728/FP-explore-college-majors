8234058,3,B000YRY802,"I am somewhere torn between a 2 -3 on this masterpiece. 3 give it for effort and this being one of the many maligned Canadian tax credit films. This borders the line between strange and incomprehensible, fans of trash cinema this ones for you. All others you have been warned!",1524441600,,276,4.54
8234059,1,B000YRY802,"Keep up with me on this one, I don't want to lose you. Bad acting, bad story, very bad lighting, bad dialog, not one likable character at all. Stay away, you have been warned. Nothing to see here at all.",1460764800,,203,4.1

""Can you read, What's in my mind? Skullduggery!  Skullduggery!...I just found a clue its all right!  Yeah!""
The plot cannot really be described, maybe ""Mazes and Monsters"" meets ""El Topo"" meets ""Suspira"" lol but better then all 3.  The convoluted plot allows you to learn the hermetic secret of Tik-Tak-Toe!
I had been emailing Anchor Bay to release this since they made available such similar masterpieces as PIN and POSSESSION, but they never responded.  Well, hopefully criterion will soon put out a definitive version.  Thank you Ota Richter for giving this fine gift to society!",1208044800,,848,4.651006711409396
