7794544,5,0973000961,"This is a film about Sumo in Japan, it's tradition, it's meaning and it's beauty.  It is not a film about the Westernized version of Sumo, nor a cartoon, nor about fat people ""taking up"" this very respected sport.
When I was sitting in the airport in Japan I watched a television screen which covered a wall. What was playing was Japanese Sumo Wrestling.  From that moment I was in love with the beauty of the traditional version of this time honored sport.  But, in America, it is almost impossible to find films from Japan concerning Sumo.
So...  I love this film.  Every non-Japanese person who is interested in Sumo should watch it. These are not just ""fat"" guys!

watch it!",1410739200,,678,4.56198347107438
