4852076,2,B005OCJMFI,"I was honestly expecting something much better in every sense.
It's a dark documentary, the music is horrible, the material very poor and there's a lot of information missing.
One main fact that is completely false in this video is how Yves Saint Laurent because Dior's successor.
Is well known that Dior called Saint Laurent 's mother and told her that he was sick and he wishes to leave his place to Yves while in this documentary they said that Marguerite chose him.
There is so many amazing resources and pieces to show form this genius that is honestly a shame that they charge for this.
If possible, I would like to have my money back,form all the documentaries I have seen about famous designers ,this is by far the worse, and is sad for me because I am a fashion designer and I love Dior's work",1358294400,9,802,4.462585034013605
4852077,4,B005OCJMFI,"Very interesting production about a nuanced creative so unlike the narcisssusts we are so accustomed to.  Beautiful pics of dresses.  Good black/white photography. Wonderful introduction to designer's friends and team.
Absolutely no dirty little secrets!",1358121600,2,254,6.228571428571429
4852078,5,B005OCJMFI,Rare black and white footage of Christian Dior in his atelier at work as well as interviews with designers he inspired. A great addition to fashion lovers and history buffs collection.,1355702400,6,184,4.967741935483871
4852079,3,B005OCJMFI,"Although the subject matter is fascinating, the film comes across like the ones we used to watch in the library in high school.  The narrator could easily be from a random old National Geographic film about mating whales.  It's ok for historical content, but not very interesting.",1352160000,6,280,4.9361702127659575

4852086,3,B005OCJMFI,It is just a little icing on a very big cake. If you know nothing of Dior then it's good. Sadly it begins with the funeral and ends with the funeral. A good summary for the novice.,1386460800,,180,3.891891891891892
4852087,2,B005OCJMFI,I thought it would be better. My students were bored. Keep in mind it's in French with subtitles and in black and white. Very educational just not entertaining for the hour.,1378857600,7,173,4.612903225806452

4852089,2,B005OCJMFI,"We all like to think that the life of a fashion designer is sexy and full of excitement.  If any of that is true, one would not be convinced of this based on this portrayal of Christian Dior.  Aside from a short period of illness, it would appear that he faced no obstacles.  Not sure he came from money, but it does sound like he had considerable privilege and got pretty much whatever he wanted.  There is also little discussion of his personal life.  On weekends, he retreated to his vacation home and drew there.  He then headed back into the city weekdays to work.  Exciting, right?  (I kind of wish I had never watched it -- because I was better off thinking of him as the struggling and angst-ridden artist.  That, . . . he was not.)",1365811200,,740,4.304347826086956

A must see for anyone who cares about fashion.",1438992000,2,260,4.630434782608695
