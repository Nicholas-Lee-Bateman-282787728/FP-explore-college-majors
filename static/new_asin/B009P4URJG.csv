8543524,5,B009P4URJG,"This is by far the best version of ALF - The Complete Series set released on DVD from Germany.  99% of the episodes are uncut and unedited.  Two of the episodes have only minor cuts.  One of the episodes is totally cut.  In the episode, ""For Your Eyes Only"" there is a song removed.  In the episode, ""Try To Remember"" ALF originally gets an electric shock but instead they have him hit his head in the bath tub.  In the episode, ""Somewhere Over The Rerun"" they used the syndicated episode instead of the original episode.  Overall, this is the best version of ALF released on DVD.  The packaging of this set is totally awesome.  This beats the US versions that are all cut episodes and edited.  You can order this here on amazon.com or order it on amazon.de and you can still log in and use the same amazon account you have for amazon.com.  I think the price is cheaper to order this on amazon.de",1504828800,,896,4.36969696969697
