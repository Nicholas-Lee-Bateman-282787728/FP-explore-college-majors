8645775,5,B00IVX52MY,"Excellent video, easy to follow.  Wasn't sure how this would be for someone with PD but so far no problems and will be recommending it to my support group.",1400803200,,155,4.344827586206897
8645776,5,B00IVX52MY,"This DVD targets people with Parkinson's disease, but I believe it is applicable to anybody with movement problems such as arthritis, fibromyalgia (FMS), multiple sclerosis (MS), muscular dystrophy (MD), cerebral palsy (CP) or even joint surgery recovery.  Don't let ""yoga"" scare you; I promise that Elizabeth will NOT tie you up like a pretzel.  The people who demonstrate the exercises (called yoga postures) are just like you... real people coping with PD, in comfortable clothes, with gray hair, tremors, and all.  Almost all of the postures can be done in a seated position, even in bed if needed.  Features include: optional cues for a partner to assist you, modifications for alternate versions of postures, a menu that lets you focus on specific areas, and reminders for water breaks.  Throughout the program Elizabeth embodies her 3 philosophies: 1) If you don't use it, you'll lose it. 2) No ADDED pain allowed. 3) Something is always better than nothing.",1397606400,3,965,5.1210191082802545
