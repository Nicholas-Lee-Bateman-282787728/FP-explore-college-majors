8333534,5,B001PKHS8G,This was one of my favorite television series. The shipping was fast and the DVD's played just fine. It was nice that this series was available and I have very much enjoyed watching it.,1356652800,,185,4.470588235294118
8333535,1,B001PKHS8G,"The DVD Titled: The Fugitive purchased from this company, on good faith, was the worst copy we've ever seen. This was copied straight off of TV and there is a lot of snow and pixilation.
At the bottom of the picture it had KTZZ station, which obviously means it was recorded in Seattle on a local station. Very poorly done!
We wish that we could get a Full Refund in this matter!
 Things like this could give Amazon a bad name.",1264982400,2,427,4.271604938271605
8333536,1,B001PKHS8G,"If I purchase the complete box set, will I receive the updated DVDs with the correct sound track? Or do I run the risk of receiving old inventory with the audio issues previously mentioned?",1249689600,6,189,4.588235294117647
8333537,5,B001PKHS8G,The previous poster is wrong. Season 2 Vol. 2 has the original music and if season 2 vol 1 doesn't CBS will send 4 replacement discs with the original music by filling out a form and sending in proof of purchase from the insert.,1234828800,9,228,4.204545454545454
8333538,1,B001PKHS8G,"Season one is okay, but beware Season 2 -- a very significant portion of the original music has been replaced with crap synthesizer music.

Purchase at your own risk.",1234396800,10,166,4.724137931034483
