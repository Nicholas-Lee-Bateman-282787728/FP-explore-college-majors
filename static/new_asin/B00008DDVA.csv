8346523,4,B00008DDVA,"Watching this film, it would be like going to a therapist and have an enlightening experience in human relations, identity, and sexuality. This is the story of an adventurous man and a repressed woman in a rural location somewhere in Mexico. Berenice, the main character, portrays an extraordinary cool woman controlled by her stingy godmother, subordinated by her status as a widower, limited by her insignificant salary from her educational career, abandoned in a narrow minded town, and disrupted of the benefits of living her life to the fullest. She is the epitome of so many people in many eras, not only women, repressed by so many factors in Mexican society, and others as well. She is an adult woman inside of a glass box that eventually will be broken and Berenice will breath again. This film allows us to see her life from the secret window of the voyeuristic eye. It is mysterious, sensual, and dramatic. It was great!",1086912000,14,931,4.825
