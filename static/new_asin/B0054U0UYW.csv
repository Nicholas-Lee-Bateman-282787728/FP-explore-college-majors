8457089,1,B0054U0UYW,I am really disappointed with particular purchase. When I opened my pkg. it was in some weird language that I could not understand. It would not play in any DVD player or computer hard drive. When I called Amazon to get it replaced with one that was in English they told me that they had not yet released the English version yet.  I didn't understand why in the world they would send someone in the USA a copy that you could not understand because it was in GERMAN! I am hoping that someone from Amazon will make it right and send me the English version.,1432684800,,554,4.276190476190476
