8455120,3,B0053CB17G,Fair movie. Bought it because I like the players and old westerns in general. Without those interest I don't think it would be considered particularly special.,1521417600,,159,5.153846153846154
8455121,4,B0053CB17G,Very nice little western starring Rick Jason of Combat fame. A bit dated but I enjoyed it and got see Jason do something other than playing soldier.,1508716800,,148,4.518518518518518

8455123,2,B0053CB17G,"This review is for the FOX CINEMA ARCHIVES released April 2016. I was dubious about buying this and I was very right. The DVD first. How in 2016 FOX can release such a travesty of a transfer is beyond me. Travesty is perhaps too harsh and personal, but...There is no ratio info on the Amazon site so I took a chance. Up comes the film in 4.3 ratio with a Scope picture inside. OK, it's happened before, I'll use my Zoom button, which I did and up come a perfect Scope ratio (bars top and bottom), but come the end of the titles it goes back to 4.3 ratio, Pan and Scan! This isn't he first time Fox have done this and I, personally, feel that it shows they just don't care. Sadly the film itself isn't very good. It has the feel of an epic which writers and producers just couldn't handle. The story of Yankee Landgrabbers taking Spanish granted land by force could have been very good but 78 mins and poor direction and scripting means a failure. Brian Keith looks uncomfortable tho he is by far the best thing in the film, even if his ""Pistolero"" sharpshooting verges on the riculous. He is closely followed in screen presence by the rather wonderful Rita Gam who in turn is followed by mala Powers (Mala fans be patient, she doesn't appear til 45 mins in). As a western fan of many years I enjoyed Steve Brodie and Lee Morgan as heavies, but the rest of the cast are unknown to me (except for Rick Jason who rides well).I hate writing negative reviews and my thoughts on the film itself are purely personal. Yours may differ. Also if the wrong ratio of a film doesn't worry you I should say the picture quality and sound are good. No extras.",1475884800,2,1643,4.320388349514563
8455124,5,B0053CB17G,"Solid Western, well cast with some good actors. Good color print. Recommended.",1474934400,,78,5.583333333333333
8455125,4,B0053CB17G,"Sierra Barron is that rare movie portraying the clash of cultures (Spanish vs. invading Americans) in early California. Rick Jason (Combat!) gave one of the best performances of his career as a Spanish land grant holder/""Californio"" representing the grace and dignity (dare I say nobility) of old Spain combined with the generosity of spirit of the frontier, facing the onslaught of greedy and duplicitous American invaders.  Brian Keith plays an uncharacteristic villain, but nevertheless adds his charisma to the production. There is some spectacular photography and one can get a sense of the unspoiled beauty of California before the enormous population increases, water wars, and general despoiling of the land of the last 160 years. Essentially the same thing happened to the Californios as happened to Native Americans elsewhere: might displaced right. I came away wondering what might have been had law won over the gun...  Please release this movie in DVD format for North America!",1391126400,4,990,5.339743589743589
