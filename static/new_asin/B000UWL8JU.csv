8325788,3,B000UWL8JU,"Whoever prepared the blurb and packaging of this 24-minute black and white German-language documentary film (no English subtitles!) didn't know either the German language or classical music particularly well, so the description is not 100% accurate.

The title SHOULD have been ""Austrian Summer Music Festivals, 1951"" and not ""The Salzburg Festival, 1945-1955,"" since the film concentrates on events that occurred in 1951 only, and contains no other footage earlier or later than 1951.

From the 1951 Salzburg Festival, we get to see some nicely chosen snippets of both musical and dramatic events, including a bit from Hugo von Hofmannsthal's morality play JEDERMAN (""Everyman"") and Shakespeare's AS YOU LIKE IT (in the German translation as WIE EUCH GEFAELLT), as well as scenes from Mozart's operas IDOMENEO (conducted by Solti that year) and THE MAGIC FLUTE (conducted by Furtwaengler), plus a bit of one of Rudolf Paumgartner's Mozart ""Serenade"" concerts. We also get to see Leopold Stokowski play on Mozart's piano at the composer's Salzburg birthplace museum, and tenor Ramon Vinay exit a taxi for a rehearsal or performance of the 1951 Festival's production of Verdi's OTELLO (Vinay is in street clothes, but is wearing the Moor's big loop ear-rings!). The DVD jacket blurb implies the JEDERMANN was produced by Max Reinhardt, but that famous director died in 1943, and the 1951 production was directed by Helene Thimig, who also acted in the production.

The film then moves to an open-air performance of Shakespeare's MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (again in German) in a 1951 production staged outside of Salzburg proper (and not part of that year's official Salzburg Festival), then on to Bregenz for another open-air production on their famous lake stage: the DVD promises Salzburg excerpts of Richard Strauss's ROSENKAVALIER, but what we get in fact is some charming vintage footage from the 1951 Bregenz production of Johann Strauss Jr's THE GYPSY BARON!

We then move on to Graz, for another open-air production of Beethoven's FIDELIO, then come back to Salzburg for the closing concert of August 31, 1951, and footage of Wilhlem Furtwaengler conducting the final pages of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Irmgard Seefried, Sieglinde Wagner, Anton Dermota, Josef Greindl, Vienna State Opera and Salzburg Cathedral Choirs and the Vienna Philharmonic.

IN SUMMARY: If you are interested in vintage footage from the 1951 Salzburg Festival (and some other Austrian summer festivals that same year), this is a fascinating document, and well worth adding as a supplement to other historical DVDs of Salzburg Festival productions available (with English subtitles) from Amazon. Fun to see the singers in their dressing rooms getting ready for THE MAGIC FLUTE, for example, or Stokowski gravely inspecting Mozart's miniature childhood violin, or to see shots of 1951 vintage cars and fashions from around the world, etc. etc.  But if you do not understand German, the commentary will be meaningless (although you may pick up on some names of famous singers or conductors), so your decision to buy (or not to buy) all depends how curious you might be to own the musical snippets on this short film for repeat viewing.

It's only 24 minutes long, there are no English subtitles, and it's downright inexcusable that the description is not 100% accurate. Even so, I enjoyed seeing this and am glad to be able to add this to my collection of Salzburg Festival videos and recordings. The musical snippets are short, but nicely done, as are the brief German-language Hofmannsthal and Shakespeare excerpts.",1307404800,,3598,5.24695652173913
