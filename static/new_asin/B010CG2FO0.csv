The only thing good was the girl is nice looking, too bad she's poisoning her body with smoking which she does in real life.",1532217600,,281,4.529411764705882

8721924,1,B010CG2FO0,"The first half is a couple fighting, ready to kill each other. Like get a divorce already. Then you see he was a moon astronaut and little green orbs of light follow him. Then he's being interrogated by a mechanical voice you can't hear clearly. Then he kills his wife and tried to drive away, but his driveway is a circle and returns him home. Oh, and his wife is alive and nagging again. What the hell? How many drugs would a person have to do to come up with this script and think it ever could possibly make sense? They couldn't have made it more cryptic, annoying, obnoxious and senseless if they tried.",1522627200,,608,4.342105263157895
8721925,2,B010CG2FO0,"Not horribly bad for low-budget, dark-comedy conspiracy theory, but it could have been much better.

Wilbur is a former astronaut who captained a secret mission to the moon in 1977, witnessed something terrifying in space that he can't remember, and then spent the next 36 years struggling with a vague certainty that has fueled his conspiracy theories (and fueled his ongoing substance abuse, as well).

Wilbur's wife, Lorraine, is an equally drug-and-booze-addled shrew who torments him day and night with her cruel taunts and hallucinations, including those of strange orbs of light buzzing around their home.

Well, to make an excrutiatingly long story much shorter, Wilbur realizes that his hellish life is an endless loop, his own personal Matrix, that is monitored and controlled by alien Orbs intent on keeping his space-encounter memories vague and scrambled for the rest of his life.  We learn that even his pig of a wife, Lorraine (who once gave birth to a hybrid human-alien), is part of the sinister plan to keep Wilbur subdued and baffled.

When Wilbur remembers the truth, there's only one course of action.

This film has the potential to be a really witty dark comedy (if it was much shorter, with a much-condensed script, better acting and better directing).  As it is, however, the movie is frustratingly slow and even painful to watch, as Wilbur and Lorraine verbally assail one another incessantly, which distracts from the underlying space-alien mystery to the point that it buries the story.

If this was a 30-minute episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, it could be a darkly-comedic science-fantasy masterpiece (under the guiding hand of a Rod Serling or Joseph Stefano, of course, who could make a short story sing).

But it's not.  At its core, this film has a really good IDEA for a short story; but it is overcooked in a cauldron of anger, drugs and alcohol abuse, and repeatedly loses track of its own storyline in favor of temperamental outbursts and arguments between the lead characters.

Seems like a waste.",1521676800,3,2052,4.988269794721408
