7868745,5,6304340044,I enjoyed this video I wish it could have been longer because there is so much to be said and told about God's heavenly creatures. I have developed a fascination over the years as I grew up regarding Angels and their purpose and interaction with mankind. So if you're an Angel person you might like to give this video a try.,1405641600,,324,4.327868852459017
7868746,5,6304340044,"An angel can illuminate the thought and mind of man by strengthening the power of vision. - St. Thomas Aquinas

This special asks more questions than it answers. At the end we only know angels are more mysterious than ever. I didn't realize Thomas Aquinas had insisted that God has given everyone a guardian angel, however I have always believed this to be true.

I'm not quite sure why they ask if angels are eternal or mortal? This makes no sense. They are obviously eternal beings. We are eternal souls. We are just in a body form at the moment trying to keep soul and body together while living on the earth.

One of the most interesting aspects of this story is the ""Phoenician drawings."" They also emphasized how Satan was God's devoted servant at one point. We do know that angels did seem to have a choice to be good or evil in the same way humans do.

What I have always wondered about is why Satan thought he could defeat God and why he still thinks he can.
