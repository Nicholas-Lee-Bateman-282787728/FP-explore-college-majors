This is perhaps the greatest music video released by a band during our time.  Ned's Atomic Dustbin is most definitely so under-rated, it should be a crime, when crap like Britney Spears and Limp Diznik rule the airwaves, it shows that the world is surely not a fair place, and success doesn't always come to those that deserve it.  If you consider yourself a fan of any kind of rock music, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  Hopefully they won't remain forgotten for long and one day they will release this VHS, along with ""Lunatic Magnets"" on DVD.  Here's crossing my fingers until then....",1079740800,5,969,4.710059171597633
8201075,5,6302294266,"This is a video of Neds Atomic Dustbin touring for the album ""God Fodder"". I wish this would be released on DVD but I am sure it will not be. This is a great film with a few videos from God Fodder but mostly live footage. I found this highly entertaining (being a fan of the band) because I have never had the chance to see Neds Atomic dustbin live so I guess this works.",1073347200,3,371,3.96
