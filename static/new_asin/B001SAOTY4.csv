8339544,3,B001SAOTY4,"As a wushu demonstration DVD it is excellent.  Clearly Master Liang is an outstanding wushu practitioner and competitor.  However, as an instructional video it fails.  Though there are more verbal comments about the movements than other Helen Liang DVDs, the movements  are still done too fast and not broken down into the individual parts.  This further complicate the presentation and  there is a distracting background as well as some movements being blurred.  Helen Liang's DVDs could be greatly improved if the mindset was changed to being a realistic instruction video, with more discussion, breaking down the individual techniques further, and doing them at a much slower speed and repeating each movement and its separate parts more than once. .  Many of Helen Liang's DVD's are produced by TC Media Inc. who seem to consistently fail in producing an instructional DVD and especially in this one with numerous distractions such as a background figure and blurred movements.  This DVD might be useful for someone who already knows the form and wants to improve their movements by viewing an outstanding practitioner.  However, for a ""student"" this DVD would result in frustration and an extreme amount of time to learn from it.  As an instructional DVD this video is not recommended.  As a demo video it has merit.",1458259200,2,1321,5.093023255813954
