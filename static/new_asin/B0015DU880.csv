First DVD pretty basic but if your not familiar with small groups is good resource . I thought the second DVD on how to handle conflicts in your group was very good, and would buy just to have this part.",1375056000,2,305,4.186440677966102
8258145,4,B0015DU880,"I would recommend this product to small groups and leaders who are trying to cultivate a culture of trust and care. There isn't a ton of Bible, and could use a little more. It helps to not assume that people know how to care with God's Word. But it does a great job of getting people going in the right direction.",1362268800,,313,4.147540983606557
8258146,5,B0015DU880,"One of the challenging this about my role as a pastor was coming into a small group that already existed, but then being thrust into the role of ""leader.""  As a young, insecure leader, I felt like I needed to provide strong leadership and teaching.  I didn't think that I could expect the group to share responsibility.  I definitely fell into the provider/consumer temptation.

Crawling out of that has been a challenge, but I'm working on it.  One thing we're doing is sharing responsibility for deciding what we want to be as a group.  We're using Cloud, Townsend, and Donahue's resource ReGroup (DVD) for this.  The production quality isn't great, but the idea is.  It gives everyone (not just the leader/pastor) a context to think about what a group could be, and what each of responsibility is in that.  It's four full length sessions, plus 13 5-minute drama vignettes for ongoing skills development as a group.

Overall: Solid resource for adult small groups, especially ones that have been going for a while and want some self-evaluation.  Probably a bit slow for experienced group leaders looking for training, or for youth small groups.",1263254400,4,1146,4.916666666666667
8258147,1,B0015DU880,"This is one of the worst recordings ever. The camera work is shoddy, swaying back and forth...in focus... out of focus. There are three people talking, sometimes all at once. Very hard to follow, I didn't get anything out of it. I give it zero stars.",1252281600,,250,4.456521739130435
