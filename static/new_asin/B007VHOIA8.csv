Thank you, Rose Ralph",1434844800,2,203,4.368421052631579
8522227,5,B007VHOIA8,"This was also heartwarming.  The girl in the story was trying to escape her old life & a mistake for a place where she could be someone else, someplace better.  She found a place peopled by folks who did not judge.  Would she stay and would she trust again?  Gently acted & slowly paced, I know this sweet tale is for me, a keeper.",1370908800,4,331,4.125
