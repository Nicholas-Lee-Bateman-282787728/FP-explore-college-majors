8308133,3,B001H8BU4Y,Only thing great in this film is Amy Acker!,1474243200,,43,3.888888888888889
8308134,4,B001H8BU4Y,"Yet another movie where Amy Acker's absence of breasts is addressed. Pretty good movie but not really great, because it has holes in plot a nd viewer is left to ''imagine'' what happened or didn't happen. However, seeing Amy lifting her leg up high in her ballerina style is worth watching.",1471910400,,290,4.705882352941177
8308135,3,B001H8BU4Y,"I'd watch Jacob Pitts eat paint.

Not enough sex scenes with him - bad choice. Story unbelievable - if you can believe main character is struggling with what path  to take and yet oozes ""I'm ready to hit the sheets"" with everyone in every scene (including the macaw )- then I have some swamp land to sell you.
But if you want a movie with Jacob P in every scene ( and I do) then it's worth watching. He's adorable, funny - good actor all around. But again, he couldn't overcome a script where the main plot is driven by his dilemma over whether to choose the life of a celibate or not , then.....no. This guy is raring to go . I just would have liked to see more of him going. One kiss with Amy Acker - c'mon!
But it was a pretty good kiss.

NOTE: if you sit down to watch ""Crossroads"" as advertised on your ""old"" movie channel and Brittany Spears is in first scene - you are watching wrong ""Crossroads."". Pitt's movie is also called ""The Novice.""",1435190400,,947,4.1923076923076925

8308138,5,B001H8BU4Y,I love this movie. It takes me places every time I watch it. I still pop it in and watch it every now and then.,1399420800,,111,3.48
8308139,1,B001H8BU4Y,"What a disappointment! This was categorized as a ""Christian"" movie, however, it WAS NOT! The language was foul and cheap with constant cursing.  There was also some nudity at the beginning of the movie, exposing a young woman's breasts (which had no reason to been shown). I didn't care for the insults and lack of respect directed towards others. When I read about the movie, I thought it would be good to watch based upon this, however it failed. I don't care to hear cursing; I don't care to hear other foul words; I especially don't like seeing nudity which served no purpose, except for a young man's comments on the first thing he saw was ""her breasts.""  I hate seeing stupid people play their parts in becoming even more stupid like Orson Bean, which was no surprise with him being a warped, frustrated, old man who when he opened his mouth the vulgarity flowed. STAY AWAY FROM WATCHING THIS MOVIE, AS IT'S A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING!""",1379548800,3,942,4.601190476190476

8308141,5,B001H8BU4Y,"Despite the unoriginal title, Crossroads is a unique story of a young man's struggles with life's paradoxes.  It charmingly tells a story of his choices and his exposure to many orginal characters that develop and influence his decision making.  The acting is genuine from a mixed cast of journeyman thespians and rising stars. Its a wholesome film that leaves the viewer satisfied.  Its salubrious. The world needs more stories like this. Bravo!",1233878400,5,446,5.166666666666667
8308142,5,B001H8BU4Y,"Alan Arkin and Frank Langella turn in their customary excellent performances in this Catholic coming-of-age dramady about a young man who isn't sure whether he wants to be a priest or a husband, but the real movie grace is wielded by Amy Acker (Angel, Alias) as the love interest whose sweetness isn't a byproduct of weakness but a sign of inner strength, one who doesn't fuss because she knows exactly what she needs to do and makes the necessary sacrifices to do it. She is what Joss Whedon calls a strong woman character.

The supporting characters, a large number of them priests, do not descend into stereotype. They display strong sides and not so strong sides, but their shortcomings are explored with understanding and empathy. (Spoiler Alert) Orson Bean, whom we first meet as a cranky old problem priest, turns out to be a man of large and frustrated passion. Having spent 25 years in Africa serving the destitute, he is ordered back home as he approaches retirement age and assigned presumably less strenuous work -- work that he clearly despises. It's a fascinating portrait of a man whose Christianity is stymied by the humane and well-intended decisions of his bureaucracy, and his subsequent path of self-destruction manages to be appalling, hilarious and heartrending.

And Amy Acker transcends it all.",1229212800,14,1318,4.986363636363636
