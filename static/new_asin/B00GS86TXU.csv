8626670,3,B00GS86TXU,"Any review of this film would have to start out by stating that it is part of the Hitlers war machine series. This series consists of captured Nazi propaganda films. The titles implies that it covers the Italian front from 1943 to 1945 but the reality is that it does not cover 1945 at all. Most of the footage is from battles and campaigns in 1943 with some from 1944.

The film itself is, pretty much, unedited. It is in German with English subtitles and with the original poor quality graphics (i.e., maps and associated animations) of films of the time. There appears to have been no remastering of the actual film or soundtrack. This is unlike, say, the DVDs of the the archive collection (or the war archive collection or war archives  unfortunately this reviewer cannot remember the exact title of the series) where captured propaganda footage is presented but with a British voice offer providing an analysis of the relevant military hardware and campaigns (this reviewer highly recommends these, primarily due to the quality of the analysis offered even though the voice over is quite monotone).

These films are what one would expect to see from a propaganda film. This includes no footage of German dead, no footage of the bloodshed and horror that is war, plenty of footage of large numbers of British, American and Commonwealth troops being captured, etc. There are some surprises though. For one there is some film footage that was captured from the British and Americans showing British and Americans fighting against the Germans. In addition, much of the propaganda in this film did not have to be stretched much. In particular that the allies were only moving at a snails pace and they had to pay heavily for this. A major reason for this, the topology of Italy, is made abundantly clear in much of the footage (i.e., high mountains and valleys, mud, poor roads, etc.).

In short, despite the age of the film and the resulting wear and tear over time, it is still worth a look for the curious (and for those that can stomach some of the other above mentioned problems).",1475366400,,2086,4.754143646408839
