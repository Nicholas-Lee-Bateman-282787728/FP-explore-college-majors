3488268,1,B001BC31RK,"Get the regular DVD.

I just finished watching my purchased copy of ""Rest Stop: Don't Look Back"" on Blu-Ray, and that's the last Warner disc I'll ever pre-order to buy.

The regular DVD of this title is chock full of extras (deleted scenes, alternate ending, commentary track, trailers), but there is nothing but the movie on the more expensive Blu-Ray. No extras at all - nada - not even the trailer! What a rip-off!

Don't Buy the Blu-Ray Version!",1223596800,32,449,4.658227848101266
3488269,3,B001BC31RK,"Two years ago to the month I reviewed the original ""Rest Stop"" and although I thought it was pretty good-I felt it was lazy because it used many elements from other horror movies such as ""Hostel"" ""Joy Ride""and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". This movie has those same elements but adds one more-the original ""Rest Stop"" The new cast including the brother of the original boyfriend, his girlfriend, and another male friend are on their way to California to find the missing brother-they come across the same rest stop toilet and the girl has to use it and her boyfriend disappears-only this time they show his kidnapping.

The loons in the camper and the maniac in the yellow truck are back but this time the movie reveals who they are and what's going on.  Hint: it involves plucked eyeballs and ghosts. The eyeballs are kept as souvenirs in a plastic zip-lock bag.

The movies ups the gore from the first film but it soon gets repetitive with all the eyeball gouging, drilling into flesh-and there are more ghosts in this movie than you can shake a stick at-and I kid you not, the toilet is a ghost.

The movie is okay to watch once but I suggest as a rental.

One more thought:  Why oh why in all these movies do people insist on traveling through deserted back roads or long forgotten highways?  Of course the simple answer is to be hacked and maimed-but maybe they should start watching some horror flicks before they make their travel plans.",1223164800,,1441,4.60546875
3488270,4,B001BC31RK,"If you seen the first rest stop then you know the films all about twists and ghosts. Thats exactly what this one is. Im not going to ruin anything though. Plenty of nice torture scenes, not insane amounts of gore, but enough. Even has a hint of action and comedy. Just stay out of the restrooms and bury your dead with their eyes.

Just a funny thing i noticed... the scene when tom climbs down a ladder the camera reveals a corpse beside him, notice the corpse's hands are hanging from a chain. The camera angle changes and tom begins to walk away, the arms of the corpse are now down.

The dvd content with this film is also great. Deleted scenes are worth the viewing!",1222992000,,671,4.317460317460317

When Jesse's brother, Tom (Richard Tillman), returns home from active duty, he sets out with his friends Marilyn (Jessie Ward) and Jared (Graham Norris) to locate the lost couple. Their search leads them to the stretch of old highway with a mysterious Rest Stop, where they find themselves in the same predicament as Nicole and Jesse: confronting the madman (Brionne Davis) driving the menacing yellow truck. As their search continues, a run-in with the ubiquitous Winnebago Family leads Marilyn and Jared to ghostly encounters with Nicole. Meanwhile, Tom is kidnapped and tortured by the psycho, but upon his escape he uses the arsenal at his disposal to take his revenge.

3488279,2,B001BC31RK,"The original Rest Stop was a pretty decent horror flick, though, as is too often the case, it was followed by an all-too-predictably disappointing sequel. I have to admit, I am a total, complete sucker for anything that is re-released in an ""uncut"" version, and I took the bait again with Don't Look Back. In all fairness, it's not atrocious - it's just a bit less than tolerably boring. The ""RV Family"" becomes more cheesy and overdone, and the suspense that was present in the first film is, obviously, lost in this second film. If I had to make a recommendation to a friend, I'd say wait until it comes out (if it does) on Netflix or Amazon Prime. It's not worth your money, unless you're a huge b-horror fan and you don't mind those kinds of horror movies that are just... ok. Certainly, everyone has their own tastes in films, but this one - which I just finished watching a few minutes ago - was honestly just a waste of time. And money.

And, for the record, ""If you don't (come dance with me) I'm gonna go Columbine."" isn't funny, even from a drunk blonde.",1430092800,3,1064,4.428571428571429

3488285,4,B001BC31RK,"Rest Stop: Don't Stop Now is actually an alright horror film.  It's about a group of young adults (a man and his girlfriend played by a woman responsible for an endless amount of drooling in Julie Mond, and the man's friend) who drive through the desert in search of two people (more friends) who disappeared a year earlier.  However, unusual things begin to happen once they make their way through more of the desert.  For one, a man in a pick-up truck insists on punishing anyone who's, according to him, a sinner.  The scene where he's ramming into the porta potty is a highlight.  This is when the one friend is only trying to use the bathroom but instead gets the surprise of his life!  I was eating undercooked pizza while watching this scene and nearly threw up.  It's a gross scene and you can probably guess why.  Yuck!

The one aspect that's actually really appealing is the paranormal aspect of the storytelling.  The segment with Julie Mond leaving the girls bathroom only to re-enter and now see the bathroom a complete torn up mess adds a much important element of surprise and fear that elevates the storytelling.  Now I'm wondering ""Are these people seeing ghosts?  What's going on???"" For storyline purposes, this means, there's no telling who's actually alive and who's dead.  REALLY nice addition.  Expect people to appear and then disappear suddenly, for reasons relating to those who are either alive or dead.  If it wasn't for this aspect and let's say, the film simply focused on a truck driver going around running over teens who sin, the storyline wouldn't have been nearly as compelling.  Great writing there.

Every character the teens meet is really strange which is another appealing element of the storytelling because you're constantly guessing who the man killing the teens in his truck actually is, and where he's hiding.  My only complaint is the family in the camper.  They consist of a weird woman/mother played by Diane Salinger, a midget, the husband/driver who's an oddball preacher of some kind, and two twin boys sucking on popsicles.  The movie writers should have written these interesting characters into the script more since they feel underused other than two appearances.

My favorite character is the one friend who tags along.  He's an easily-frightened dorky guy who always finds himself involved in dangerous life or death predicaments.  He's a really good actor.  You really feel sorry for him.

Overall, expect scares, horror, occasional violence, and a decent paranormal aspect that's rewarding by the conclusion.  I did not see *that* ending coming, haha.  Highly recommended.  The only drawback is that the film is too short overall.  Should have been 30 minutes longer.",1372032000,,2726,4.955849889624724

3488288,2,B001BC31RK,"While this sequel fills in some of the holes presented in the timeline and story of the original Rest Stop movie, it is nonetheless unfulfilling horror with a deserted California rest stop and bathroom as a set.

Following the disappearance of the morons from the first movies, Tom (Tillman) is home on leave from the Army and looking for his missing brother.  Immediately I knew he was an idiot because he had on PFC rank but called himself a corporal.  Along for the ride is his alcoholic girlfriend Marilyn (Ward) - who probably would have acted better if actually drunk - and a complete train-wreck of a best friend named Jared (Norris).  Animosity between the two sidekicks leads to this being a two car journey from Texas to California, and the dork is driving a beater that smokes more than a Memphis rib joint.  First stupid decision of many.

Upon arrival in California, the ginger best friend gets isolated in a port-a-potty because of his IBS, and it gets tipped over by the killer from the first movie.  Awash in symbolism, that kid is.  Something about this movie and its locations reminds me of bowel movements.  Regardless, the killer is a flannel shirt wearing hillbilly that is slightly less scary than the Brawny man.  Maybe the Scrawny Brawny Man?  At least he had ample supplies to clean up all the blood after he did some handy work with a drill.  Do I smell a marketing opportunity here?  Anyway, this dude is terrorizing innocents at this rest stop and torturing them in a refurbished school bus because a family of circus freaks and religious fanatics in a Winnebago (because that hasn't been done before) had a bloody run-in with him a few years back.  Because that makes sense.  Once the group makes it to the actual rest stop, there is some mumbo-jumbo explanation that eye saw right through, a few flashbacks, and a foreshadowed conclusion.  The thing that gets me, though, is judging by the phonebook-sized collection of missing person flyers at the rest stop, it's apparent that the equivalent of Des Moines, IA is missing; yet, there is little police involvement.  Go figure.

The positive of this film is that it the majority of the film doesn't follow an incontinent schizophrenic in and out of a feces and blood covered bathroom.  Also there is no Joey Lawrence - the poor man's Keanu Reeves.  Whoa!

Rent it...if you are related to one of the actors.  Otherwise, skip it.

The suspense and dramatic occurances of the first film are simply missing in this rather boring sequel, and the acting isen't better than last time, perhaps even worse.

To make matters worse this one feels contrived and rather unnatural in its make up; the torture scene at the end seemed far too mandatory and routine for my taste, and it came across as a way to keep the horror fans in line, who needless to say, probably comprise about at least 80% of the potential audience of this movie.

Therefore, not worth seeing.",1258243200,,674,4.694915254237288

3488296,3,B001BC31RK,"Rest Stop: Don't Look Back is a sequel to the 2006 horror film Rest Stop, about a crazed pickup truck driver terrorizing a young couple at a deserted California rest stop.  It wasn't a very good film but the sequel manages to out do the original, rising to passable horror fare.  Tom (Richard Tillman) is the brother of Jess who disappeared in the first film along with his girl friend Nicole.  Home for two weeks on leave from the army, Tom decides to go in search of his missing sibling.  He's joined for the ride by his girlfriend Marilyn (Jessie Ward) and his buddy Jared(Norris).  Evidently, because Marilyn doesn't like Jared, the goof is forced to drive his own beater of a car from Texas to California.

We're treated to a replay of the ""Driver's"" origin.  He was just a bumpkin picked up by a family of religious zealots (nuts actually) in their RV.  He's killed but is resurrected as a silent spirit, haunting the highways around the rest stop for victims to torture and kill.  It isn't long before the trio of friends is on his trail, tipped off by the creepy owner of a gas station (Steve Railsback).  Jared is attacked while inside a port-a-potty as it is run into by the truck, spilling its disgusting contents all over him.  Tom is then kidnapped by the Driver and taken to a torture chamber outfitted in an old school bus.  With help from Nicole's ghost, Jared and Marilyn will try to find Tom and figure out a way to destroy the Driver once and for all.

Better than the original but still not a good film, Rest Stop: Don't Look Back is filled with inconsistencies.  The Driver seems to have that annoying ability to appear and disappear at will which he uses to cheat his victims just when you think they've escaped and yet he seemingly leaves him self vulnerable.  The main problem with the film is that the assailant just isn't all that scary or intimidating.  He's a hillbilly in a flannel shirt and baseball cap and his attempts at a menacing glare are laughable.

Infinitely scarier and underutilized is the nutjob family in the RV.  The sex-crazed mom, the fire and brimstone dad, the two kids in suits who never talk, and the dwarf son who is tormented by his older brothers.  The sequel almost entirely abandons the rest stop where much of the action in the first film took place.  There are only a couple of short scenes there and most of film takes place on the open road.  There's a good deal of gore including victims getting their eyes scooped out, legs drilled into, and other assorted wince-inducing torments.

The cast is certainly better this time.  Tillman and Ward give more convincing performances than their predecessors in the first film while Norris and Railsback provide some comic relief.  Rest Stop: Don't Look Back isn't must viewing but if the video store pickings are slim you could certainly do worse.",1233014400,9,2849,4.607142857142857

3488298,3,B001BC31RK,"I actually liked rest stop, the first one that is. With the end of the first one giving you the idea that the killer in the truck is a ghost, it is confirmed and expanded on in this sequel.

This time around the brother of the guy from the first movie, his girlfriend and immature side kick go hunting a year after the last movie took place now that the brother has returned from military service.

They track down a few things and end up at the rest stop from the previous film and find themselves in the same situation being hunted by the ghost of a yellow pick up.

This one expands and explains how the ghosts come to be and seeing as how the cats out of the bag, it's more of a ghost story about the whole area surrounding the rest stop, which gives room to get out of the rest stop area that was the scene for about 80% of the original movie, and this one uses that rest stop for like 10% of it and takes you elsewhere to see how all this stuff came to be.

In the first film I didn't understand what the freaky family in the Winnebago was about and thought it should have been cut out of the first movie as it did not fit in with it, this movie explains what that was about and who that Addams Family on acid is and why.

Also a good thing they did is the gratuitous nudity is hardly scene in this, the first movie threw it in for no reason other then to attract an audience of perverts, least they realized they did not need it for this film.

And as I suspected, it leaves open an opportunity for a 3rd sequel which I would like to see if it gets made.

I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first movie, but it's watchable. It's not like it's one of those movies that leaves you thinking, ""what did they have to do with the first one"" - or ""that just kills the rules of the first movie"" it actually explains it all and is a fun little ride for the hour and a half it goes for.

3488300,3,B001BC31RK,"Rest Stop was an interesting movie the first time around.  It was an independent film that really built a lot of atmosphere and tension in my opinion.  I was interested in getting some answers about ""The Driver"" and ""The Winnebego Family.""  That is why I really wanted to watch Rest Stop - Don't Look Back.

We start out with Tom, the older brother of Jess Hilts (from the first movie) getting back from War in Iraq.  He is determined to find out the fate of his younger brother Jess, as the Police have not been able to find out any answers for a year now.  So Tom and his girlfriend Marilyn (insert a drunk sorority girl) plus an overly nerdy friend Jared set off to solve the mystery.  Acting was sub-par.  In the first movie, I could feel the fear as the characters were being stalked.  This movie, the characters are way too brave.  Almost no hesitation throughout the movie.  Probably to push the story along faster.

It takes them almost no time at all to run into ""The Driver.""  Now, the reason I wanted to watch this movie was to get some background on ""The Driver"" and ""Winnebego Family.""  The background story is delivered, and I must say that I was not impressed with the mythology.  However I will not spoil it for those who have not seen it.  Lets just say that it all gets pawned off to Indian legends.  Seems like they got a little lazy to me.  I was really hoping for an interesting story line about these supernatural phenomena.

Once the group get to the titular Rest Stop, everything pretty well happens the way the first movie went.  Add a lot more ghost sightings and tougher characters for the most part.  I would say that this movie could have been a lot better.  However, due to the low budget, I would like to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I feel like I was entertained, but I was also disappointed in the writing.  I truly believe that they dropped the ball.  They could have created a unique story and captitalized on the intrigue that was created in the first movie.",1225238400,2,2000,4.398907103825136
