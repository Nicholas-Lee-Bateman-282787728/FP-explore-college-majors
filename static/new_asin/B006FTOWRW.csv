8497200,5,B006FTOWRW,"I cannot believe that I bought this DVD and failed to review it.
I was working in France when this gang was operating and we used to run a sweepstake at work as to where they would strike next
My command of French is not particularly good but I found that I could follow the majority of the dialogue without the subtitles
It's a fast paced, well acted and has great direction - highly recommended",1428019200,,396,4.293333333333333
8497201,5,B006FTOWRW,A very well done french crime movie. Shows the loyalty tests these men endure over the years only to find out one of them is a snitch and must be found and dealt with. I have seen many French crime movies and find almost all very well done and in most ways superior to most all American crime films of today. Even with subtitles I still prefer a French crime noir to todays American muck.,1425513600,,388,4.1866666666666665

8497203,5,B006FTOWRW,I really enjoyed this film. I guess I am just not into so much bloodshed. Brotherhood means something to me and this continued for many years. I am hoping to find one I can buy that will play here in the USA.,1382400000,,208,3.9761904761904763
8497204,1,B006FTOWRW,"This film has no plot and no story. The actors are hard to look at, and there is no one to root for. Gratuitous, nonsensical violence, terrible casting, direction, script, cinematography, and very boring.

Lots of ethnic hugging and face kissing, for reasons meant to evoke admiration or something in us, but it's just stupid-looking. Also, none of these guys are scary; they just look real ethnic-ie.

There's just NOTHING going on here.

I do Not recommend it unless you have nothing better to do or need to practice your French before morning.",1378684800,,546,4.849462365591398
8497205,3,B006FTOWRW,"After making his reputation with tales of dysfunctional cops like 36 Quai des Orfevres, MR 73 and the TV series Braquo, French cop-turned-director Olivier Marchal takes a look at the other side with Les Lyonnais aka Gang Story, which sees Gerard Lanvin's successful ageing crook torn between flashbacks of his youth and springing childhood friend Tcheky Karyo from jail. Naturally things go horribly wrong, blood is spilled, the innocent suffer and long buried secrets and betrayals are uncovered.

Based loosely on the real Gang des Lyonnais and the memoirs of its leader Edmond Vidal, it's not as bleak or as emotionally gruelling as his much more ambitious MR 73 [DVD]. There's a somewhat melancholy print the legend aspect to it and the structure and certain plot aspects probably owe more of a debt to Sergio Leone's Once upon a Time in America than to the truth - something emphasised by the very much alive appearance in the making of documentary of one real-life gang member who is killed in the film. It's a less iconic or ambiguous film and it gets off to a somewhat awkward start as it moves between the protagonists' past (where Lanvin and Karyo's characters are ably played by Dimitri Storoge and Olivier Chantreau) and present as the cops and drug runners alike step up the pressure. It's at its best in the energetic flashback scenes as we trace Lanvin's 70s rise from learning his craft with a gang of De Gaullist thugs who commit armed robbery to fund their fight against the left and promptly try to kill him, his wife and child when he asks for his cut to forming a hugely successful gang of his own. The more sedate, considered modern-day section takes rather longer to grab hold, with much silent introspection before the stakes are raised enough to gradually become compelling in their own right. The end result isn't a classic, but it's a satisfying polar that's worth a look despite the familiarity of the material.

The 52-minute documentary on Entertainment One's UK PAL DVD is more interesting than most, dealing with the relationship between the ex-robber and ex-cop turned filmmaker as much as the making of the film, though it's the only extra, though the English subtitled 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is fine.",1355097600,2,2239,4.874015748031496
8497206,4,B006FTOWRW,"French film noir has been a popular genre since the time of Jacques Becker and Henri-Georges Clouzot, and thankfully its great tradition is not likely to die out anytime soon. A French noir ""Les Lyonnais,"" based on the memoirs of a real-life gangster Edmond ""Momon"" Vidal (played by Grard Lanvin), may not be the greatest French crime drama in the history, but a police officer-turned-actor-turned-film director Olivier Marchal has successfully created a gritty crime drama with a classic theme of camaraderie.

The story of ""Les Lyonnais"" switches back and forth between two timelines, one about Vidal's turbulent career as a member of ""Les Lyonnais,"" a notorious group of armed robbers in the early 1970s, and the other about Vidal, now retired, living a quiet life with his grandchildren.

Vidal's peaceful days are interrupted, however, when his childhood friend and former partner Serge Suttel (Tchky Karyo) is arrested by the French police. Vidal knows that Suttel, who has betrayed another gangster Zerbib (Laurent Fernandez), will not survive in the prison, so he has to do something right now, even though this means violence and bloodshed.

""Les Lyonnais"" does not offer anything new as far as its ""action"" goes. The gangster's criminal activities are quickly told, and its descriptions are less detailed than you would expect. The film is heavier on the drama of Vidal, Suttel and their families than on gunplay, though when the occasion arises, the film provides a decent action scene.

Perhaps Olivier Marchal did better in his crime thriller ""36 Quai des Orfvres."" In ""Les Lyonnais"" I think too many flashbacks prevent us from relating to the characters, and some action sequences look as if borrowed from other crime action films. Still, thanks to the strong acting from the entire cast, ""Les Lyonnais"" is an engaging modern French noir.",1349740800,3,1852,5.142857142857143
