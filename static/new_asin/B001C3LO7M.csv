8285734,4,B001C3LO7M,Training miniature horses is a bit different from full size ones in that their reactions are sometimes not what you expect.  The video goes through the steps using two different horses so that the reactions and responses can be compared when using the same training method.  It is a helpful guide and tool for the novice who wants to begin training their horse effectively and gently. This is a first step video and the other session videos are recommended to get the most out of the topics or to see how things progress more fully.,1240185600,5,532,4.589473684210526
