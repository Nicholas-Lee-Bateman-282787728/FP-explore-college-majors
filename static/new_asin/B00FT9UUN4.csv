8618521,1,B00FT9UUN4,"Three stars for the film itself. Worth watching mainly because of Fukada Kyoko.

One star because of the English subtitles.
English it's supposed to be.
However it's not English.
It's not even broken English.
It's English being shattered, torn to pieces and scattered to the four winds.
I couldn't believe my eyes and had a hard time following the film's plot.
How can so many mistakes be piled up ? Nearly no sentence is correct. Various kinds of mistakes occur frequently. Here's just what I noticed: Use of wrong prepositions and tenses, misspelling, shuffling of letters within words (deoplvement), but must of all: sentences with no sense at all. Laugh or cry, here are some examples:
- ""Must be can wrote""
- ""Does it goose"" (supposed to be the translation of the Japanese sentence ""ii ja nai desu ka"" = ""Good', isn't it ?"")
- ""How intended next ?""
- ""This have to see you""
- ""We are deeply accepted this words""
- ""Some idea want to to live relax""
- ""Can let me to see""
- ""Why demang the thing far away ?""
- ""I am understand""
- ""Can we creation together ?""

The latter may yet become a hip phrase among young people.

Whoever is responsible for these ""English"" subtitles must be a huge fan of the European ""Dada""-movement (early 20th century).
I AM a fan of the ""Dada"" movement, and I would perhaps be ready to take these subtitles in good humour - had the DVD not been so expensive.",1436745600,,1388,4.478260869565218
