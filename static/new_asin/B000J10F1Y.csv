2665560,2,B000J10F1Y,"I used to be a dance teacher and I'm starting to teach my two young daughters dance.  I found this DVD to be cheezy, too simple, too short and too 80's.  Even the Jazz music it comes with sounds like an 80's department store CD.  Sorry, but don't waste your money on this one.",1193875200,8,276,4.074074074074074
2665561,5,B000J10F1Y,My daughter is 7 and has been taking ballet and has had some jazz classes.  She finds this DVD instructual but a little fast.  She says she was really struggling to keep up--I did instruct her to stop the action and rewind to catch up with the steps.  She says she did enjoy it.,1185840000,5,278,4.111111111111111

8148513,3,B000J10F1Y,"I have ordered several dance DVDs for toddlers, only one of them caught my girl's attention and made her want to follow the instructions on the video. This one wasn't a successful purchase. I personally find it a bit old-fashioned and not fun enough to interest a young kid. It has some basic jazz steps, but nothing about them motivates the viewer to participate and try them. The background music does not correspond to the moves, as if they are not moving to music at all. The quality is very nice though, I guess the overall idea was good, but didn't work for us.",1376179200,3,567,4.461538461538462
