3140387,4,B00154GEGE,"Okay, so this is a indie film, which means their are some aspects of this film that are not what you'd expect from big-budget sci fi.  For instance, the leads are great, but some of the supporting cast are clearly not professional actors and leave a lot to be desired.  Also, you can see in how the special effects sequences how care was put in to minimizing an effect so that the budget wasn't blown.  But given those caveats, I was blown away by this little movie.  It had some great concepts, and then managed to morph into a first rate stalker film that was genuinely chilling.  But more then that, I believed that any normal fellow in Daniel's position would go through these changes.  Something to think about...",1250640000,,718,4.5271317829457365

This one is slightly less intelligent, but in the same path.  The only problem that I have with the film (and because of that is not a 4 stars review) is that I prefer my characters to be more conscious of how they use their new discovered powers.

3140391,5,B00154GEGE,"The technical wizardry and absorbing plot development are reminiscent of early Spielberg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  How Shaftel and Joler achieve the technical feats of suspending time and motion (even water droplets in a shower spray) defies comprehension.

Daniel is at first compulsively intrigued by his ability to observe Sarah's activities without her knowledge simply by pressing the pause button on his videocamera.  Responsible for the death of her husband, he at first feels responsible for helping her and improving her life.  This becomes a fixation and Daniel becomes obsessed with his power to the extent that the viewer watches his mind become unhinged from reality - subtly and so gradually, without acknowledgment, that the effect is eerie.  The viewer realizes Daniel has lost touch with reality in a sudden insight.  Daniel oversteps the bounds of sanity and wants to possess Sarah.  She finally comprehends what is taking place and is repulsed - with an entirely credible and terrifying conclusion.  This is mature plot development combined with technical skill that defies belief - an auspicious introduction to a blossoming movie talent.

8257531,4,B00154GEGE,"Okay, the set-up for this one is a bit out there: after a group of vigilantes/snuff filmmakers break vicious killer Tom Hanson out of prison to execute him, Hanson overpowers and kills his captors, then sets off for home to continue the killing spree he began eight years ago.  High on his kill list is his own daughter Emily (Ellen Macnevin) a creative but troubled girl tormented mercilessly at school by a group of scummy bullies.  As Emily is at home one night, working on her artwork and taking care of her little brother Jeremy, she's unaware that her father is even now cutting a path of carnage to her.

Without going into what they are, Suspension uses a couple of twists later in the movie that are not going to be to everyone's liking.  The first is a plot turn that many would argue started off fine years ago, but has been overused in recent years.  For myself, I'm less concerned with how often or how little it's used than with how effective it is, and I think Suspension did it right, adding a couple of unexpected hooks into this particular device.  The second twist was potentially more problematic.  It occassionally works, but most of the time filmmakers use this particular plot turn it just blows up in their faces.  One of the most impressive things about Suspension is that it manages to actually make it work.  In fact, it's very rare that a movie - or book, for that matter - taking this track has used it so well.  Suspension is a recent movie that didn't get much attention, but it definately shouldn't be overlooked by horror fans in general and slasher fans in particular.",1469664000,,1602,4.550522648083624
8257532,5,B00154GEGE,Thanks for having this!  I am proud to add this to my DVD collection!,1458777600,2,69,3.9285714285714284

8257534,4,B00154GEGE,"Suspension is your typical slasher film with a twist at it's conclusion. While the same twist ending has been used in other films, Suspension is still pretty good. The acting is fairly decent and the special fx are well done. The only thing that annoyed me was that some of the scenes seem to be filmed in black and white? The last thing i have to say is that the way the movie ended, Some other scenes leave u confused. Thanx for reading.",1448755200,,439,4.301204819277109
8257535,3,B00154GEGE,"Watch out! There are apparently two movies currently circulating by the name of ""Suspension."" Most of the other reviews of this film are in fact reviewing a better film starring Annie Tedesco. This film, the one that features a bloody, knife-wielding young woman on its jacket - stars Ellen MacNevin, and does not involve any suspension of time. This MacNevin movie is a very crude, cruel, routine slasher film for most of its course. Do NOT buy or rent it thinking you will see anything with the psychological finesse of suspending people in time. It's likely that the word ""suspension"" in this titled film refers to the Jason-like slasher's tendency to occasionally suspend his victims from meat hooks or from other handy protuberances - although the word could also be striving for an oblique reference to the fact that the protagonist is stuck in place by her horrible heredity.

Emily is trying to get past the fact that her father went berserk and became a slashing killer before disappearing into the mists. Now, on the anniversary of his killing spree, it seems likely that he has returned to indiscriminately finish off everyone else in town. He comes inexorably out of the woods holding a butcher knife or pitchfork - a figure out of every Grade-B slasher film ever made.

I almost gave this film just 2-stars, but in the end elevated to 3-stars, because amidst its cheesy gore and amateurish acting, it does have a few points of interest. The opening credits show the world as perceived from an aerial, black-and-white film-negative perspective while an eerie heavy metal version of ""All the Pretty Horses"" plays. Then along the way, we see the normal expression on one character's face morph into an expression of such deranged hatred - that it's bound to send chills down the viewer's spine. This is a splash of very good acting among the bad - like the splashes of red that signal a killing on the way.

The attempt at a novel resolution of all this mayhem is telegraphed from multiple directions along the way. We see it coming, but there is a certain logic to it when it finally arrives and loose ends get tied up - or, you might say, trailing entrails get untangled. You realize that a little more thought went into the different twists and touches of color and symbolism than you might at first have suspected.

But just don't get this film with the girl in white jeans on the cover - thinking you're going to get a film about what could be done if you could freeze people in time. This is a different film altogether - one that might benumb you frozen in bored disgust. Or maybe not - if you like good old-fashioned blood and gore.",1448496000,6,2650,4.655982905982906
8257536,1,B00154GEGE,"Havent seen a mainstream release this terrible in a while. Ive seen better acting in the no budget, backyard horror Ive seen and the female lead here is particularly grating. The direction is equally awful, having no kind of flair and carrying a truly awful pace. The story is really bad too, and the supposed twist can practically be seen coming from the first frame. There is a little bit of blood with halfway decent FX work, no nudity. I wondered what the name was about and by the end I figured it out. You need serious suspension of disbelief to think for even a second that the people behind this movie thought it was acceptable to release something this awful.",1446681600,,668,4.528925619834711

8257539,5,B00154GEGE,"A man loses his family in a car accident and discovers his son's camcorder can stop time. It starts out like a typical made for TV movie, then something starts to happen. You get drawn in to it. What is going to happen next? Is he going to use the power of the camcorder to stop time and do little pranks or just better his life by taking money from people frozen in time? It is skillfully done how he progress from a sad man to a bully then a man completely corrupted by this power. An absolute top notch Indie film. The music blended beautiful with the suspense. The acting was so natural in keeping with the characters. The scenes with the time stopped, how did they do it? I have watched big budget movies with flawed special effects, none here. Now for the ending. Starts off with certain predictability then has a Hitchcock finality. The movie does have a Hitchcock build up of suspense. This movie is better than some of Hitchcock's movies. BTW I'm not a fan of Indie movies.",1313020800,3,982,4.371584699453552
