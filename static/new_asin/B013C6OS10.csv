8727200,3,B013C6OS10,"This review is for Deadliest Prey [2015 Blu-Ray] just in case there are review combinations in the future.

Honestly, I don't even know what I watched. I even waited a day to digest what exactly just happened. Deadliest Prey, the sequel/remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Prey/dp/B013C6OP9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Prey</a>, feels like a parody.
To address the elephant in the room, this movie is 99% identical to the 1987 prequel. Even the actors in the special features are a bit confused whether this is supposed to be a sequel or a remake. The plot features the villain from Deadly Prey being released from prison, only to recreate his cat-and-mouse hunt of the main character in an attempt to prove he is the superior soldier. This leads to identical beat-for-beat scenes compared to the '87 Deadly Prey, only the actors are much older. I don't even know if this was lazy scriptwriting or just genius.

The production values of Deadliest Prey are better than '87 Deadly Prey in some areas, and much much worse in others. Modern HD cameras were obviously used, so the picture quality is quite high barring the occasional bad lighting and special effects but the sound design is terrible. While I previously complained about how poor and muffled the audio quality was in '87&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Prey-Blu-ray/dp/B013C6OSWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Prey [Blu-ray</a>], in this case everything is quite the opposite. We can hear in crystal clear fidelity every crunching leaf, random bird song, and hum of various air conditioners. Every single one of which is far too loud and hugely distracting when you are trying to follow the movie. The air conditioning hum is especially jarring when cutting to a new scene.

So, is this movie a ""so bad it is good"" type B movie? Well... yes. The '87 Deadly Prey movie felt like an earnest attempt at a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood/dp/B003PUZ2NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood</a>&nbsp;style action movie with limited budget, and while it had some very iconic moments it didn't often fall into the the realm of absurd. Deadliest Prey on the other hand, does. The actors no longer look or sound vaguely like soldiers, but rather random college kids that were pulled in from the street and dressed in camo. The action scenes are no longer high intensity, but rather seem almost comically geriatric due to the way they were shot. A huge plot point in this movie features a trio of ""hackers"" who seemingly do nothing but play video games on laptops in the middle of a kitchen, and then proceed to drive around in an old compact car trying to ""help"". I both hated and loved them.

Why is my rating so low? Well, it's simply because I can't tell if this was bad on purpose. The lazy script, combined with poor actor choice, subpar audio mixing, almost bizarre editing and cheap special effects combine into something special. It's just a shame I've already seen 99% of it in another movie.

All that said, I can't recommend this to the general public, only B movie lovers. Deadliest Prey is in a catch-22 situation where to fully appreciate how good/bad it is, you have to watch Deadly Prey. But once you've done that, why watch Deadliest Prey?",1470441600,,3381,5.335834896810507
8727201,1,B013C6OS10,"first let me say that I hate wasting money. Second I hate wasting money on something I should have known was awful. Shame on me. I did see the very first one of these something like 27 years before this one. It was just called Deadly Prey. The only upside to that one was the fact that it had some eye candy. This has nothing. The same revenge type plot with the same guys from 27 years ago and believe me they did not age well at all. The acting in the first was so-so and how could they have gotten worse in this time. The ""fight"" scenes were so badly staged that I made it for 37 minutes before it got the heave-ho. Huge warning.....do not bother with tis muck.",1464998400,,664,4.076335877862595
8727202,5,B013C6OS10,"A perfect follow up to Deadly Prey, one of the best bad movies of all time. The levels of sincerity and joy here are hard to match, the best possible follow up to a fantastic B movie.",1451865600,,183,3.972972972972973
8727203,4,B013C6OS10,"This is a combined review for also the second part Deadly Prey:

Here we enter a double feature of two action packed low budget, Drive-In wonderment's of the B-movie class. A true dose of perfect B-Movies to entertain. Deadly Prey is a trip back to the Ma and Pa video stores. As I have often stated, I miss those days of entering movie heaven, role after role of VHS cover art. Those days are long gone, but as long as there are companies like Olive Films, Slasher Video, Martini Entertainment, there will be outlets to experience, these cheesy beauties once again.

Our first feature is Deadly Prey, starring Ted Prior. Your main character is Michael Mike Danton (Ted Prior). Colonel Hogan is your main baddie, who uses his mercenaries in any situation for the right price. Danton minding his own business, taking out the trash one day is kidnapped. He is forcefully taken to a wooden area, striped, and placed in a human hunting situation. Hogan is using innocent people for training his new troops. But what Hogan doesnt realize is they took the wrong man. Danton is not your average person. Danton is a Vietnam Veteran with the skills of killing, and taking out enemies one by one.

This is a great 80s action on the lines of a B-movie, but all fun entertainment. Its fun, cheesy, and a wonderful trip back into the world of lower budget action films of the 80s. A perfect late night, Drive-In style cinematic cheese-fest of perfection. Fighting, guns, and victims.

Olive Films, Slasher Video, Martini Entertainment did a fantastic job in bringing this forgotten 80s film to Blu-ray.

Next up is the sequel to Deadly Prey, known as The Deadliest Prey. This takes place years later. This was made in 2013, so you can see the huge gap. 27 years, the wait was long, but the result was b-movie greatness. What is so great about this, is everyone is back for a second dose of butt kicking. Danton 27 years later, take out the dam trash again, and is kidnapped yet again by the cat and mouse mercenaries. Danton is placed again back in the woods, and must fight again to survive the ordeal. The blood is more, the deaths are more, leading to that phrase, the second time around is more, more, more. Ted Prior returns to the part he made famous (giggles). Danton must fight to survive his ordeal again, and now its no holds bar. Also returning from the original is David Campbell and Fritz Matthews. Also another family member joins the cast of the Prior. You are introduced to Michael Prior. Michael worked also on two other David Prior films, Lost at War which he was second assistant director, and on Zombie Wars, which he played the character of Young David. So its a family affair in these b-movie wonderment's.

Now if you don't know both of these where directed and written by David A. Prior. And stars his brother in the main lead character Ted Prior. David Prior sadly passed this year in August 2015. Prior was a genius of lower budget cinema. He has directed and created many films. He was the co-founder of Action International Pictures, or simple known as AIP. He created some of the greatest cheesy films of all time. He was a true B-movie god and guru that never got the stardom he deserved. I feel that he is as great, as Roger Corman.

Prior created one of the first slasher films to ever be shot on tape, the one and only B-movie 1983s Sledgehammer. If you haven't seen it, then it cant be explained. Prior has always been a part of my life, growing up watching all his action cheese fest, and horror b-movies.

He was everything that is great about making movies. He did it his way, his style, and his vision. I can mention many films that he created that would leave you in a world of B-movie bliss. With films like, ManKillers (1987), Killer Workout (1987), Death Chase (1988), Future Force (1989), The Final Sanction (1990), and so many others. He worked all the way up to his death. His last film being co-writer to the 2015s, Dancin: Its On! Directing 34 movies in his career. Sadly 59 years old is way too young to die, he had so many other wonderful b-movies to create.  There is one thing I was always guaranteed going into his films, I was going to be thoroughly entertained no matter how cheesy they were.

Another great aspect about Deadly Prey is it has some great co-stars the one and only Hollywood acting legend Cameron Mitchell. Mitchell needs no introduction to the film world, starring in many countless films both great and small. They Were Expendable, Flight to Mars, Carousel, Blood and Black Lace, Hombre, The Toolbox Murders, The Swarm, The Demon, Without Warning, Night Train to Terror, Memorial Valley Massacre and many others. He starred in many high budget films, all the way to cheesy, low budget B-movie glories. He was a true golden age actor that left a world of entertainment to many fans. It was great seeing him in this.

Starring your main lead Ted Prior really needs no introduction also to the countless fans of B-movies. He was in many of his brothers films, and also in many other cheesy wonderment's such as, Surf Nazis Must Die. He is a fantastic action B-movie star. A perfect blend of over the top entertainment in all its glory.

Deadly Prey also has the wonderful, sexy Troy Donahue, another Hollywood star. He was an ultimate sex symbol in the 50s and 60s. Not only an actor but a singer. He stared in one my favorite Sci-fi films, 1957s The Monolith Monsters. He was in many films both great and small. Later in life he was in the amazing, The Godfather Part 2, and one my favorite films, John Waters Cry-Baby. It was really great seeing him in Deadly Prey.

Audio/Video:

Now you have to realize that the original Deadly Prey was never treated well, and so the best available elements have been brought to this blu-ray. I think the film has never looked any better than this release. You have to realize Deadly Prey was remastered from a PAL Beta SP format. It was transferred to Blu-ray in this style. Its rough at times, but still is a great example of bringing out an 80s film that never really was treated well in the first place. Slasher Video, Olive Films and Martini entertainment did an utterly awesome job in my viewpoint.

Deadly Prey has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1
The Deadliest Prey has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and looks wonderful on this blu-ray.

Special Features:

Something I love about the Slasher Video releases is they come with special features. I wish Olive Films would realize that is what collectors, and fans want. They want extras on their Blu-rays. Thankfully the Slasher releases through Olive Films blu-ray and DVD has done that.

On Deadly Prey you get the Extras:
Photo Gallery, Dubbed Prey, Deadly Prey Trailer, Interview with Makeup Effects Artist Jack Hojohn, and outtakes.

On The Deadliest Prey you get the special features:
Interview with Ted Prior, Interview with David A. Prior, Interview with David Campbell, Interview with Fritz Matthews.

Overall:

This was a great double feature. Weather you watch them a part or together like I did, it's all entertainment. Back to back B-movie action films that leave you smiling in perfect entertain bliss. Slasher Video, Olive Films through the Martini Entertainment created awesome, must own, must see blu-ray's for any fan who love the B-movie style.

I was thoroughly happy and pleased with both of these wild, over the top, perfect examples of B-class action. It doesnt get any better than these two wild, films on great blu-ray releases. Rest in Peace David A. Prior.

8727204,2,B013C6OS10,"Deadliest Prey is a sequel to 1987s The Deadly Prey. In the earlier film, Special Forces soldier Mike Danton (Ted Prior) was reluctantly drawn into conflict with Colonel Hogan (David Campbell), his ex-commanding officer. Thrown into the middle of the woods nearly naked and without weapons, Danton was forced to fight huge numbers of armed soldiers to survive. He did survive, killing all but one  Col. Hogan. In the current film, Hogan is released from prison and immediately determines to seek revenge on Danton. He quickly reconnects with his troops and has Danton kidnapped with a nefarious plan to make him suffer before hes killed.

An action flick in the style of Rambo, Deadliest Prey is cartoon-like in its larger-than-life lead characters and seems more a carbon copy of the original than a continuation. Director David A. Prior provides practically non-stop mayhem but little else. You won't find terrific acting or clever dialogue here. Its an unapologetic action movie with a simple, straightforward plot pitting two modern-day warriors against each other. This movie and its predecessor owe much to The Most Dangerous Game and The Naked Prey, films in which protagonists battle enormous obstacles to survive.

There is an interesting subtext to The Deadliest Game. As we watch Hogan, whos been stewing in jail for 27 years planning vengeance, we see how his military service in Vietnam has hardened him and wounded him mentally. He uses the skills he learned as a U.S. Marine to fashion the ultimate revenge. Hogan suggests officials in ancient Rome who conducted gladiatorial matches to the death for the pleasure of the masses.

Bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release include interviews with Ted Prior, David A. Prior, David Campbell, and  Fritz Matthews.",1447459200,,1778,5.159722222222222
