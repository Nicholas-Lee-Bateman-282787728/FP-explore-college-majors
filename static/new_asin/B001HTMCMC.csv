I used a lot of the tips I learned from Tom during production when painting my own home, and I found that the tips Tom provides helped make the painting process easier with a lot better quality results. Though I considered myself a fairly experienced DIY-er when it came to painting home interiors, I discovered that I had a lot to learn from Tom. I highly recommend this video!",1255478400,,464,4.344827586206897
