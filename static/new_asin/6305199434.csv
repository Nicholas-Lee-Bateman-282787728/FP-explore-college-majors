986095,1,6305199434,"This is NOT a Sandra Bullock movie.  In this travesty called a film, she plays an extremely minor role.  She only shows up on the cover in order to trick you into buying this movie.  Don't fall for it.
You should only buy this movie if you are an aficionado of wretched writing, awful acting, predictable plot lines, and desperately need some way to kill ninety minutes.",1010880000,7,370,4.492537313432836
986096,1,6305199434,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I bought this movie at my local mall because Sandra Bullock's face was on the cover. It was the ONLY face on the cover. It even said ""STARING Sandra Bullock."" I love Sandra. I love all of her movies. But this is NOT her movie. She is only in it a few minutes. The company that has released this DVD is doing a severe act of false advertising. It wouldn't be so bad if the movie was half way decent. But there is absolutely nothing good about this movie and I mean NOTHING! Do not buy this DVD. You WILL regret it.",1006387200,27,573,3.9482758620689653
986097,2,6305199434,"I bought this DVD because I like Ms. Bullock. She has very little screen time. The movie takes place in New York's East Side, which is supposed to be a hotbed of intrigue. An elite corps of ex-CIA agents forms a covert terrorist team known as The Hangmen. When the hero finds out about this, he is targeted for elimination, but the villains forget that the CIA has trained him as well.",995587200,4,385,4.361111111111111
986098,3,6305199434,Hangman is a movie releaseds to profit on Sandra Bullock.  The movie itself is a passable movie with predictable plot and average acting...but giving Sandra Bullock  top billing is questionable....she is in the movie for a total of about 15 minutes....It isn't a bad movie but it is far from good.,991785600,,297,4.803921568627451
986099,2,6305199434,"The one and only reason i think this movie is o.k. is because of Sandra Bullock. It is clearly not her falt for the poor producing and directing. She was just doing her job and doing what she was told to do. She cannot be blamed for that. We all make mistakes in the what ever line of work we do. It just happens in an actor r actresses case the whole entire world can vbiew thier mistakes. This may not have been an exillent movie but, for me i bought it because it had Sandra Bullock in it. I will buy a Sandra Bullock movie no matter how bad it is. This was also made when they didn't have as much technology. You have to take that into consideration also. It was not that bad. It was not the greatest either. But, if you are truely a Sandra Bullock fan. And you have been from the start than you will buy this movie. And if not then just critisize it with everyone else. That shows you don't truely care about an acotrs performance but, the extream technology that is used today. Boy, you you have been down when the very fist T.V.'s and T.V. shows aired!!!",982972800,3,1061,4.130434782608695
986100,1,6305199434,"This movie is so bad, that 5 minutes into you've had enough.  I, too am a Sandra Bullock fan, but I'm sure she doesn't list this on her CV.  Well, I guess everyone has to start somewhere, right? This movie has a pathetic plot, distorted soundtrack, and cliche- ridden dialogue. Don't bother buying this, don't bother renting it, and ... don't bother watching it.",981763200,4,362,4.640625
986101,2,6305199434,"To be entirely fair, this movie has some good points to it. One of them is that it ENDS.

However, some snippets here and there are kind of interesting. The gun-cam shots, Sandra Bullock's tranquelized stupor, and maybe one or two other rare moments shine above the mid-80s film school quality that makes up the bulk of this flick. Other parts are downright dumb, and / or rottenly acted (can you say, ""friends of the director?""). Sandra really is the best of the cast, even for an early work.
Overall, it looks like the movie was made on a super low budget at some college campus. Most of the budget went into renting guns, apparently.
The basic plot is that an estranged father turns out to be a former CIA agent. Bad guys decide to kill him before he is re-activcated to kill them. Son, ex-wife, son's girlfriend, and Dad's old Special Forces Army buddies are all put in danger.
It certainly isn't great or memorable. At times it's downright confusing. But even so it is better than some of the flicks being cranked out for release today (release direct to video, anyway). At least the movie is cohesively bad, and stays true to whatever atmosphere it attempts to create, bad or not.
I can't say it was a complete waste of my time, but yeah... it was a real clock-watcher.",980726400,,1275,4.51948051948052
986102,1,6305199434,"I have always found Sandra Bullock to nothing less than mesmerizing - just not today... or should I say 13 years ago.  To be fair, this isn't really HER movie, she just happens to play a minor character in it.
To say this was  a low budget flick is an insult to low budget flicks.  I love movies and  have quite a collection.  I can usually find at least one redeeming quality  in any movie and will frequently watch a not-so-good movie in it's entirety  just to find that quality.
Poor directing & acting, embarrassing  editing, pathetic special effects (like the 'gun cam' shots) and an  anticlimactic ending make this movie actually painful to watch.  It's not  often you'll hear me say this, but I was happy when this horrible waste of  film and time was over!  If it were an option, I would have rated this move  a NEGATIVE 5 stars.
I didn't like the movie...",955411200,29,864,4.420382165605096
986206,1,6305199434,Don't even bother with this movie.  Must have been one of Sandra Bullock's earlier movies.  It's not worth the price or time.,1363824000,,125,4.636363636363637
986207,5,6305199434,"I purchased this CD and enjoyed watching it. I know it is an older movie, but I wanted it and I bought it.",1360454400,,106,3.652173913043478
986208,1,6305199434,"First, 1980s Sandra only has a whopping total of 2 minutes of screen time.  The sum of her lines is about ""so and so is on the phone"" and ""I'm really scared"".  She gets maybe 2 minutes of screen time.  Since this was her first film, I'm amazed she got her 2nd film.

The rest of this movie is filled with terribly forced ""tough talk"" lines.  The director has a fetish with ""gun cams"" where the camera is attached to the gun, which looks horrible.  The director also has a fetish with random computer lights blinking and 80s computer music.  The fight/gunplay scenes are laugh out loud terrible,  complete with bad guys jumping out spread eagle in front of the good guy only to get a shotgun blast to the chest....poor bad guys when will you learn to use cover?",1309219200,2,760,4.378571428571429
986209,5,6305199434,This is one of those movies where it's so bad it's good and a lot of it isn't bad at all. I don't see why people give it such a hard time.,1282867200,,138,3.34375
986210,1,6305199434,This movie was just transferred from a VHS to a DVD with almost unintelligible speech and very dull sound. I'd rather see the VHS format.,1274659200,,137,4.52
986211,2,6305199434,"I am an avid fan of Sandra Bullock.  I've tried to view all of her films.  But this one is really awful.  Turgid and flawed, without much of a plot.",1266796800,3,148,3.8666666666666667
986212,1,6305199434,"This movie was so bad it was laughable. One of those where you keep saying ""It's GOT to get better!""  (it doesn't).  Bad story, horrible acting, cheesy slo-mo of ""action"" shots - this looks like a very rough 1st cut somebody salvaged from a trash bin. They didn't even finish the last scene! It just mercifully stops.  I removed the CD from the player and put it directly into MY trash bin.",1187654400,,390,4.388888888888889
986213,1,6305199434,"And give yourself ten stars if you made it all the way through. I don't know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it's the worst I've ever seen. It was like end-to-end junk. No plot, no acting, no direction, no point. A scrap yard, a wrecker dump. A gun collection. These people (they weren't actors) were given lines to say 2 minutes before filming, and they said them. Some of them made faces. A lot of triggers were pulled, and men ran around shooting. The body-count was innumerable. Jaw-dropping, mind-numbing, belief-begging. Ugh-gh-gh. I'll just add something to that. If someone had deliberately set out to make the worst movie ever made they could not have made one worse than Hangmen. Actually, this must be a record: something supremely remarkable  has been achieved, without even trying.",1121817600,5,804,4.826086956521739
986214,1,6305199434,"Reading the reviews is more entertaining than this absolute piece of trash.  I think this starts an entire new catagory of being worthless and not entertaining in the least.  If they had left it in the original French, or whatever the language was, and not dubbed in a bad english soundtrack, at least it would be tolerable (except for the lack of plot and bad acting).  Blockbuster should have done their customers a favor and not even offered it!!!",1115337600,4,450,4.670886075949367

Don't let the DVD cover fool you.  Sandra Bullock is not the star of this movie..in fact, she's hardly in it at all and when she is, she's downright terrible.  I'm sure she doesn't include this turkey on her resume.  There's not one redeeming quality to this so-called thriller.  The performances are all awful; the editing and cinematography are choppy and amateurish; the direction is nil.  Truly a bad movie, not worth anyone's time.  Shame on you Sandra!",1105142400,6,634,4.598214285714286
986280,1,6305199434,"Yes, I do believe that most of these reviewers have over-rated this film.  One star indeed - where do you folks get off with such generosity?  I too picked it up because of Sandra Bullock's pic on the cover, but I'm convinced that I overspent - I got it free at the library!  I will recommend to them that they put it in the fireplace where it can actually be of some value - little though that will be.",1089072000,6,403,4.075949367088608
986281,1,6305199434,"The only movies that come to being as bad as this movie have all been on Mystery Science Theater.  I'm sure this one would end up there if it weren't for all of the violence.  The acting is downright horrible (never made it to the part with Sandra in it... I was about to throw up after 30 minutes and couldn't take any more).  The cinematography is even worse... some of the worst angles, light/dark problems, etc. I've ever seen.  I'm convinced games like Doom took their idea from this movie... there are shots where you are following guns around and watching them shoot people.
Another reviewer mentioned that High Schoolers could make better movies... I agree and I'm not so sure a middle schooler couldn't.
I found this one in the bargain bin at Walmart... it doesn't belong in the bargain bin, it belongs in the trash bin.",1065571200,3,829,4.543624161073826

986284,1,6305199434,"I bought this movie because Sandra Bullock was on the cover, and I like her as an actress.  However, she was on the cover just to sell this awful DVD!  Her picture as shown on the cover must have been taken elsewhere, because this movie was made in '87, and in the movie she has 80s clothes and hair, not the hip look she has on the cover.  Also, she appears for only about 5 minutes as the main character's ditzy girlfriend.  The sound quality stank, the ""plot"" was plotless, and the movie overall was boring and stupid.  I definitely would only recommend this movie as a coaster or frisbee, not for its entertainment value as a movie!",1055462400,,636,4.3559322033898304
986285,1,6305199434,"I can't believe I paid money for that DVD! It is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am ashamed of the people using Sandra's name to sell this poor excuse for a production.
Yes, Sandra Bullock was in the movie. No, she was not the star. The Internet Movie Database, [...}lists this film as her first. The one positive thing that this movie shows is how much Sandra's skill as an actress have grown. If you are looking for a good Sandra Bullock film, this isn't the one.
The plot is thin and the violence is extreme. Very few characters survived this movie. It seemed like someone was shot or knifed in almost every scene. I'm amazed that any actors came out of this film with anything resembling a career.

(I  cannot think of the reputation, condition, or location of a video store that would rent this.  The store would have been torched by the returning customer.)  In one scene, Sandra Bullock goes into the library and proceeds to cry and whine to her friends there.  You never find out what is wrong.  Maybe because she has just had the script translated for her.  She had not read it when she signed on to do the film and just found out that her future in film is now in severe jeopardy.  Thank God she survived and that most of the copies of this movie are forever lost.  I know the copy that I had will never see the light of day again.",1027123200,,743,4.169014084507042
