8610813,5,B000B5XSYE,"I have to say that I was one of the lucky 1,000 people or so that saw ""Three Barbecues"" at their screening in Covington, KY - just across the river from Cincinnati.  What a fun and witty movie.

The film was actually filmed in various parts of Cincinnati, OH and features among others, the famous chef Jean Robert de Cavel.  This movie has it all - drama, suspense, romance, action, cameos from famous people and lots and lots of potato salad.  But the best part of the movie has to be the music video/dream sequence including The Deviled Egg Nut and the foxy Candy Barklage.  I can't believe that MTV hasn't picked it up yet...

If you like quirky films like Hair Spray, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka or even Blazing Saddles - this is a must have for your movie collection.  I guarantee you'll watch it a half dozen times!",1128556800,9,842,4.428571428571429
