It is true, it seems that the Feds produced this movie to try to cover their you know what. Don't waste your money, buy Waco, Rules of Engagement.",998956800,5,266,4.34
7904841,1,B000006QMF,"Plain and simple the video is a documentary from the Government's P.O.V. and seems to be made in the F.B.I  and A.T.F. studio! So if you want a real documentary get ""Rules of Engagement"" After all it doesn't even study how the A.T.F. lied to get C.E.V's (Combat Engineer  Vehicle),M.B.T.'s(Main Battle Tank)A.P.C.'s(armored Personel Carrier),UH-1's and OH-6's from Fort Hood in violation of the ""Posse Comitatus Act"" You Don't need  to be a rocket scientist to know who attacked whom!",975801600,4,484,5.10126582278481
7904842,1,B000006QMF,"I myself own this movie and was seriously disappointed but not surprised by the lack of real evidence presented in the film, but also the outright inconsistancies WITH the evidence and what it shows. This flim blazes over  the majority of the evidence and presents a clearly biased position in  favor of the government propaganda.
I recommend a serious Waco  investigator to perhaps rent this from a library rather than spend the hard  earned money..and tape it.  The interviews with survivors is worth the  time.
With Danforth's ""investigation"" exonerating the  government, this film should fit right along with that whole mentality.  Waco Massacre Never Again!",964915200,,662,5.238095238095238
7904843,4,B000006QMF,"This film analyzes the entire situation at Waco.  Starting with a brief background on the Davidians it also covers the ATF raid, the siege, the final holocaust, and it gives a pretty good recap of the trail of the  surviving Davidians.  And it does it all in only 50 minutes.
On the plus  side 'Attack at Waco' makes a very serious attempt to be unbiased.  It  includes several points of view on the major issues of Waco, and it really  appears to be without an agenda of its own in either direction.  Like the  better-known film 'Waco: Rules of Engagement' this film has a good number  of short interviews with Davidian survivors and others who are sympathetic  to the Davidians.  Unlike 'Rules' this film stays neutral.  It weighs the  Davidian positions as well as those of law enforcement, cult experts and  former members of the Davidian community.  I would also give special  commendation to this film for the care with which it avoided loaded terms  such as compound, bunker or cultist.
I have only one real criticism of  this film: it's way too short to cover Waco thoroughly.  The attempt to  present so many points of view so briefly had a tendency to mean they were  not presented that well.  There really is no time to delve into events in  dispute such as the question of whether ATF agents in the helicopters fired  on the Davidians, who fired first, and who set the April 19th fire.
Everything considered I preferred 'Waco: Rules of Engagement' to this  film.  This is not only because the bias in 'Rules' corresponds to my own,  but also because I liked the depth of its coverage, its great sense of  drama and the way it made so clear what a tragedy Waco was.  However, if  you are looking for a brief (say about enough to fit in one 50 minute class  period) program on Waco, that is completely unbiased, covers the entire  event, and avoids the gruesome photos seen in Rules of Engagement then you  would do well to consider this film.",956880000,6,1953,4.5491329479768785
