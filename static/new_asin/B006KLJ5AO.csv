8500188,4,B006KLJ5AO,"This is a review of the dvd issue, not the bluray, which is due out in a month or so (wish I'd waited).

First, the music and interpretation:- I have always had a soft spot for the Faure Requiem - it has none of the bombast and histrionics of some of the other requiem masses. Lots of beautiful melodies abound - it is altogether a very soothing piece. It is also done here with a larger orchestra and choir, which I prefer to the versions I have heard using small groups. Jarvi is well suited to this music, and he doesn't hang around - quite swift tempi, especially in the Agnus Dei (the prettiest movement), which fairly rips along, compared to other audio versions. The Orchestre de Paris has this piece in their bones, and the soloists and choir acquit themselves admirably.

The other pieces, Pavane, Elegie and Cantique de Jean Racine I am familiar with, and are also done very well. The last item is very rarely performed - Super flumina Babylonis, but should be heard more often. Very nice!

This review is not five stars because of Euroarts pulling its frequent trick of pretending this is a true Dolby or dts soundtrack. Almost no information comes out of the center and rear channels - just a very low level mixdown of the left and right channels. Other labels like Accentus and C-Major don't have this problem on their dvd issues. Funnily enough, Euroarts Bluray DTS MASTER AUDIO soundtracks are just fine. I have several other dvd releases from Euroarts with this problem, and lots more that are true surround. Lets just have truth in labeling, Euroarts - if all you're offering is PCM stereo, say so and if that's a deal killer, so be it. Stop this fake surround nonsense.

If you have a newer surround receiver or amp (say Denon), you can use the multi channel stereo setting for these pseudo surround discs, which at least sends the sound through all the speakers, and results in a fuller sound stage.

All in all, very nice performance, but wait for the bluray to get the optimum sound.",1333497600,8,2004,4.571030640668524
8500189,5,B006KLJ5AO,"Paavo Jrvi is one of the great conductors of our time: young enough to give us many years of his art, old enough to possess a mature, often highly individual approach to his scores. God only knows how he manages his four orchestras and to give stellar performances with each, drawing on the individual strength and collective idiom of his respective musicians. Here he is seen and heard (in fine sound and video) with his Orchestre de Paris and the Choeur de l'Orchestre de Paris in a flawless recording from the Salle Pleyel (2011) in an all-Faur program. Among the beautifully executed smaller pieces, ""Super Flumina Babylonis"" for choir and orchestra appears to be a world-premiere recording, as Jrvi explains in an intelligent bonus interview. The Pavane, the lgie and the Cantique de Jean Racine are all part of the international concert repertoire, but (too) seldom heard. Faur, like some others of his fellow French romantic composers, was not very prolific. His Requiem alone, however, secures him a place in immortality. It is a subdued, sweet, consoling piece, totally unlike the masses for the dead by Berlioz, Dvorak, Verdi and others. The Requiem has an ethereal quality which needs the sensitive, elegant touch of a conductor fully in tune with the music and, preferably, a French orchestra of high caliber. Both are in attendance. Jrvi wisely chose the version for full orchestra (as opposed to the minimalist one often heard today), and he and his players give it their all to tremendous and moving effect. Equally good are the choir and the two soloists, in particular Chen Reiss transcendentally beautiful in the Pie Jesu. The recording reminds me of the old Cluytens/Victoria de los Angeles reading, but it is even better in its highlighting of the work's inner dynamics. Given the right mood, this Requiem might bring tears to your eyes.",1330387200,19,1857,4.97427652733119
