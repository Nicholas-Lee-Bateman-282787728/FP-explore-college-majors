8185636,3,B000OLTLMS,"This is a rare, good, funny Abbott and Costello skit from the Colgate Comedy Hour television show. Definitely worth a couple bucks to watch. (But, not worth the price I paid, which was triple that.) The skit is only about 14 minutes long.

Both the normal 2D and synthesized 3D versions are included. The DVD arrived in a paper DVD sleeve.

The skit revolves around Bud and Lou going to the horror movie prop room to get props for an upcoming performance. There is no credit roll listing the actors. The skit includes appearances by the Property Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Invisible Man (though, his is not an 'appearance', technically).

I mostly bought this for the 3D. The 3D was... ahm... interesting. It is a regular 2D TV broadcast comedy skit (which is also included). The DVD author has converted it into anaglyph 3D (red/cyan 3D glasses style - red on the right, I think). This does show some depth. The good news is that it looks like an earnest attempt at 3D, not just a simple frame offset trick.

The bad news is that the anaglyph 3D ghosts too badly to work. Very little was staged at the screen plane. Most things were either well behind or well in front of the screen, which is why the 3D fails (this amplifies the ghosting). Not much continuous depth within any objects. (For example the prop room tabletop appears to be all at the same depth, instead of continuously varying through depth.) Often, the right eye's image was vertically higher than the matching left eye's image, so the 3D was straining to watch. All in all, the 3D was partially successful, but not enough to be worth the price by itself.

Very bad move not to have included a Field Sequential 3-D version, which is what all the 3-D film lovers watch, because it has much less ghosting. Anaglyph looks like bad 3-D on all TVs, while Field Sequential looks great, but only works some TVs.  It's only a 14 minute sketch, plenty of room left over on the DVD -- including both 3D formats would've sold better.

If you collect Abbott and Costello, then this is a good purchase. If you collect 3D, then this probably isn't what you want.",1186185600,2,2161,4.568475452196383
