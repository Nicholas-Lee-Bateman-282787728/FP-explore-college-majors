1668944,5,B00005UW8F,"Zipang is the story of a modern-era Aegis cruiser built by American contractors after the year 2000, in the hands of the Japanese Defense Force, being thrown back in time to 1942, into the midst of the Battle of Midway.
Zipang is unusual in Japanime, which is usually rife with action constantly.  If you're looking for a Guyver or Gundum, this is not it; in the first four episodes there is exactly one battle, and even in it they do their best NOT to destroy the enemy vessel.
The crew of the cruiser are torn between their allegiances, on one hand they were trained to be allies of the American Navy, on the other thousands of Japanese sailors are dying before their eyes.
Despite the relative lack of action in this series, it is likely the very best Japanime I have ever experienced.  the historical details of the era of WWII are flawless...as are the technical and operational details of how an Aegis class cruiser operates.
If you're a fan of both anime and WWII (as I am) this is a total win. Especially if you watch it in the original Japanese voices, (with English subtitles if needed).  I say this quite seriously, the Canadian/English voice-cast is the one truly vulgar and broken thing about this series.  But that's not the fault of the Japanese writers and animators, who made this one a win.",1198108800,,1308,4.576923076923077
1668945,4,B00005UW8F,"I first saw the manga about 6 years ago in Japan.  The video version is fairly true to the spirit of the original. Viewers will really like the accurate depiction of a Japanese Aegis Destroyer in action.

Oh, and the whole time-travel, Modern Japan versus Old Imperial Japan dilemma is interesting as well.",1168041600,,306,4.754716981132075
1668946,4,B00005UW8F,"The Mirai is running low on fuel and supplies so its officers have to start contemplating what options are left open to them. In addition, some of the crew are showing the first signs of becoming a bit mutinous as they contemplate drifting alone on the seas till the end of World War II. Some think the best thing to do is turn the ship over to the Japanese military. At least that would be some kind of life. After perusing the ship's history books, Kusaka, the Japanese Navy Officer that was rescued from a sinking plane, offers a third choice, which might be the most dangerous. He suggests going to one of the southern Japanese colonies where a lot of oil is produced and where they will attract less attention. The problem is that Kusaka's true motives are unknown. Is he going to throw in his lot in with the Mirai crew, or is he plotting to somehow use the ship to change the course of the war? Kadomatsu is sent along with him as he uses his military authority to procure fuel and provisions.

The cliche about any time travel show that becomes annoying is the constant fear of changing the future, thereby cancelling it a la Back to the Future. The problem with this plot device is that nobody REALLY knows what would happen. Can anyone please bring forth exhibit A, the butterfly that flaps its wings and changes the severity of El Nino? To me, the time travel aspect is pretty boring. The thing that makes Zipang a good show is seeing the characters struggle to make important decisions in situations that most people could not even comprehend. The writing really shows the crew struggling with every action, wondering whether they are wiping out their own future. Kusaka is a great character because even the viewer is left in the dark about his true intentions, so we come to identify with Kadomatsu, who is as ignorant as we are. So I guess the strength of the show is in its ability to make the viewer feel the character's uncertainty about whether the course they are taking is getting them any closer to returning to their own time or whether that time will even exist to return to! Good show. Very suspenseful and well-acted.",1164067200,,2143,4.537467700258398
1668947,5,B00005UW8F,"if u read the kids review. u must think its so funny because this dvd is great for anime fans. and were not sitting with our mommys and all, we just love anime. without anime, then wheres the fun and the cartoon. some adults can be like japanese cartoons",1130198400,,254,4.204081632653061
1668948,5,B00005UW8F,"I've seen almost evry episode of Vandread so to catch up I'm going to get all the episodes on DVD. Takeshi Mori, you blew us away. Amazing graphics and sound. The problems of romance, hatred, happieness and others were well put I've seen the ending but ain't say'n nothin. I'll tell you though It made me cry, which is something I rarely do unless the movie is really big.",1121904000,,372,4.405797101449275
1668949,4,B00005UW8F,"The second installment of the Vandread series continues to add to the storyline. The history of Meia is revealed. The relationship between Dita and Hibiki comes to a head, as Hibiki is overwhelmed by the attention. Jura shows her vain and jealous sides as she sets a plot in motion to allow her to ""combine"" with Hibiki's Van-type. The crew begins to show its ""colors"" making them more real, genuine.
Though there is action and comedy in the episodes of this volume, the main thrust seems to be character development. It really made the story more compelling for me.",1026777600,5,566,4.7272727272727275
1668950,4,B00005UW8F,"Vandread is a fun anime with some nice subtleties.  The first disc felt kinda rushed to me, introducing the characters and their motivations.  The second disc goes deeper into the psyche of especially Meia and somewhat into Dita, giving them more depth than solid, aloof leader and goofy ditzy rookie.
The characters are fun to watch, and you really get to like them.  The animation is pretty cool and the CG is nicely done.  It's refreshing watching a series where the characters have fun in their adventures, especially after watching the Neon Genesis Evangelion and Escaflowne series.  Although I prefer listening to the Japanese language soundtrack (I don't understand it, but the emotion gets across much better), the portions of the English language soundtrack I have heard is probably one of the best I've heard.  (I REALLY disliked Shinji Ikari's high pitched whiny kid voice and words in NGE).
All in all it's a nice anime to watch, and a provides an interesting answer to the ""what if..."" question of men and women.",1021248000,4,1025,4.895953757225434

7955581,5,B00005UW8F,"An interesting series, to say the least.  This science fiction anime continues the story of a present-day Japanese warship and crew mysteriously being transported back in time to the WWII era.  I personally like the story and twists in the plot, as well as being able to catch a glimpse of WWII from Japan's perspective.",1459641600,,320,4.8

I do not like Vandred all that much but I am a collector of all anime, horror, and u.s. cartoons from the 80's - 2000, it's sort of a hobby of mine. I found this show at a resale shop for $1.00 and needed this to complete the set.",1453161600,,271,3.857142857142857

7955585,5,B00005UW8F,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1355184000,,848,4.66
7955586,5,B00005UW8F,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,2,920,4.317919075144508

I absolutely love this anime!  I'm totally addicted to it now!  It gets more and more complicated for Rin and all the women who love him.  It has the most hilarious parts woven throughout.",1236038400,2,333,7.275
7955588,5,B00005UW8F,"WELL THINGS AROUND REIN IS STARTING TO GET A LITTLE WEIRD.  THE FIRST EPISODE STARTS OFF WITH KAEDE FEELING A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS AS SIA AND RINA SAVE REIN FROM THE GROUPIES (THE KKK, SSS, AND RRR).  SHE TRIES SO HARD THAT SHE GETS SICK FROM THE EXHAUSTION.  THE OTHER GIRLS JUMP IN TO HELP SAVE REIN AND PRIMELLA (RIMU FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW), WITH FUN HIJINKS.  EPISODE TWO IS A REMU EPISODE WHEN REIN AND KAEDE REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN REMU SMILE AND.  RINA IS A LITTLE SHOCKED BY THAT AND TRIES TO DOWNPLAY IT (SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT).  THEN SHE APPEARS AT THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THE CAT SHE CARRIES IS LOSING ITS STICHING. WHEN REIN REALIZES THAT REMU DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROPER UNDERGARMENTS, THE GIRLS TAKE ON THE LINGERE STORE BY STORM, EMBARASSING HIM SO MUCH HE RUNS OUT.  CAN A PRESENT FROM HIM BRING OUT A SMILE FROM THE SHY LITTLE DEMON?  EPISODE THREE HAS ASA IN A QUANDRY.  SHE HAS AN ADMIRER, BUT WHY DOES SHE KEEP THINKING OF REIN?  AND WHEN SHE SPRAINS HER ANKLE AND REIN HELPS HER HOME, CAN SHE GET A LITTLE ALONE TIME WITH HIM?  THE FINAL EPSIODE HAS SIA TAKING REIN ON A DATE AROUND TOWN.  ARMED WITH HER HOROSCOPE AND 'LUCKY PANTIES' SHE HOPES TO HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH HIM, IF THEY CAN STOP RUNNING INTO EVERYONE ELSE FROM SCHOOL.

THIS DISC HAS LOTS OF LAUGHS, CHAIR SMACKS, AND A GOOD PORTION OF FAN SERVICE.  A DEFINATE ENJOYABLE STORY GETS BETTER AS THE 5 GIRLS RACE TO WIN THE HEART OF SOMEONE WITH THE LUCK OF TENCHII MUYO.
