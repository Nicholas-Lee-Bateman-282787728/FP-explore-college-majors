8123238,1,B000FILUW4,"Could not get past Joey Medina and his back alley, drunk off of too many cans of bud light humor. Fans of Latino comedy relate to the comedians in a way that connects them to personal experiences or in some way provide some sense of nostalgia. Joey makes a weak attempt at creating this however his right-wing attitude takes over as he rants about how another minority group should be discriminated against in a tirade of curse words and pseudo-patriotism. The content consisted of his encouraging airport security to stereotype people of the middle east as possible terrorists and treat them as such. He also made light of the media's reporting of abuse at prison camps in the middle east. Joey justified his comments at the end of this section of the monologue by stating that he was not racist because he had dated a middle eastern female then proceeded to make a derogatory comment about her. While humor often takes a political note, he has chosen to focus on the Latino market. Such oppression is not far from the minds of the Latino people as they are often targeted through racial profiling for a multitude of social issues and non-violent crimes.

Despite his Latino heritage, Joey Medina does not display any connection to the Latino community in this product. Latin Palooza is a disgrace to the Latino community and I implore anyone to stay away from it. It is not worth your money and he does not deserve it anyway. If you are a member of the Tea Party, a Minuteman (unpaid civilians who patrol the border against ""wetbacks""), or any other person who is a fake Latino, you will probably like it.",1310515200,,1607,4.658450704225352
8123239,5,B000FILUW4,"One of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Whether you are Latino or not you won't stop laughing.  Joey Medina is one of the rising stars of comedy.  Alex Reynundo, Willie Barcena, Mike Robles and Darren Carter also give standout performances!",1153872000,,245,4.785714285714286
