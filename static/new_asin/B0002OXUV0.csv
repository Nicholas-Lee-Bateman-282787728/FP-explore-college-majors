8030135,3,B0002OXUV0,"It's a given that the movie is way down on the ""so bad it's good scale"", so anyone expecting ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" doesn't have a clue. The dub isn't the greatest by any means. It has TERRIBLE interlacing artifacts that create hundreds of little bands across the screen if you try to watch it using popular PotPlayer on your computer, but if you watch it using VLC & turn Yadif X2 de-interlacing on, the bands disappear, but then there's the grainy low fidelity image probably dubbed off a VHS tape and the ""postage stamp"" 2.25:1 letterboxing inside 4:3 (again... probably a down & dirty VHS dub) doesn't help either, BUT this movie was impossible to find for a very long time except on hard to find VHS copies, so if you absolutely have to watch it because of the infamous watermelon monster, well now you can.",1501891200,,822,4.598639455782313

8030138,4,B0002OXUV0,"DVD Review: Crash Cinema version! Not properly formatted to the widescreen TV; smaller picture. Embedded subtitles, Grindhouse like picture and the sound was descent. And nothing else.

Movie Review: One of the Yuen Clan's schizophrenic Wu Tang movies and one of the best of the bunch. The humor is average but the primitive effects and kung fu action is wonderful. Also this movie has this hot chick and her butt was grabbed. URRRRRRGH!!!

In Conclusion: 3 stars for the DVD and 3 1/2 for Taoism Drunkard.",1424476800,,506,4.872093023255814

8030140,5,B0002OXUV0,"""The Astronomic Bastard,"" a guy with huge diagonal eyebrows wearing a black and white wig, rips open the side of a dude's face while hanging upside-down & then throws him through a wall. He then gets strapped to a seat and pushed down a huge metal slide that burns the skin on the palms of his hands. He also fights an old master, who can make his clothes fly off by yelling, with spikes covering his back & blades coming out of his elbows and kneecaps. The evil dude with black and white hair kills the master, who can levitate himself while spinning on his back breakdance-style, with a hollow metal ball that shoots out smaller metal balls. There's also a man dressed like an old woman (who's supposed to be a for real old lady & not a drag queen) who captures the Astronomic Bastard with a table before attacking him a really, really, really big levitating sword. The old lady & her grandson escape into a back room and the AB follows by flying through the air like a spinning torpedo over a bed of red-hot coals. Then comes one of the greatest scenes in motion picture history: in the back room, the Astronomical Bastard fights a black, two-legged, spherical monster with yellow eyes that chomps at his balls with razor-sharp teeth and talks in a high-pitched voice. It also has these metal tentacles that shoot out of its head. The tentacles have cup-like attachments at the ends that the monster uses to feel the Astronomic Bastard's nipples while it has what looks to be an orgasm before rolling itself into a giant drawer. The old lady then flies into the room through a curtain & fights the Bastard with a giant bong. She also smokes during the battle and uses the huge smoke clouds to disappear and reappear around the room. There's also this giant foot also pops out of the wall right before the old lady blows the wad of herb out of the bong. The smoldering herb sticks to the Bastard's head, the old lady jams her fingers into the AB's eyes and.....rips off the Bastard's face! Turns out the Bastard is a kinda hot young chick who then fights the old lady using her scarf, which she can extend and stretch out. When the old lady's grandson sees the fight through a hole in the wall, the young chick wraps her scarf around the old lady's throat, jumps through a curtain & strangles her. Throughout all of this, there's also dudes who yell really loudly while floating, jumping through the air and crashing through tables and chairs.",1378252800,3,2445,4.521444695259594

8030143,5,B0002OXUV0,"This review is copies from badmovies DOT org. I could put it in my own words, but this review says it all! Also you'll want the old DUBBED VHS edition of this film, as the subtitled one on DVD isn't quite as fun without the hilarious english voice overs.

The Characters:

(Work with me here, there were NO credits)
Cha Le and Jun - Virgin boy who is becoming a monk, she is the girlfriend who won't give it up.
Old Devil - Powerful evil spirit, he has this cannonball which spits out mini cannonballs. Rat Face and Cha Le finally defeat him.
Rat Face - Alcoholic with a face like some rodent, he uses very powerful Kung Fu though.
Granny - Cha Le's grandmother, she is a powerful martial arts witch. I think the actor was a man. Killed by Princess.
The Watermelon Monster - This thing is a riot! It's a giant toothed cannonball!
Princess - Cult leader, very pretty and her sash is deadly. Ends up enslaved to Old Devil and killed by Cha Le.
Fat Chick and Shining Knight - Princess' cultists, Fat Chick has this weird ""antenna"" hair style.

The Plot:

I was entirely unprepared for this movie, it is a confusing but hilarious roller coaster of Kung Fu mayhem! Words can hardly describe the number of crazy kicks, punches, and special weapons you are treated to. And now for the equally absurd plot. Rat Face is tasked with finding a virgin male born on the 15th of August to perform a temple ritual. Cha Le (a virgin born on the 15th of August) is learning the art of being a martial arts using witch from his manly grandmother. He must retrieve the ""secret document"" from a hidden room, reaching it involves many dangers, and The Watermelon Monster guards the script. Princess and her cult often collect money from people, they can be very violent about not contributing. Old Devil wants the ""secret document"" to gain more power or something. The situation comes to a head at the temple ceremony where Rat Face and Cha Le must battle Old Devil. Confused? Watching it won't help - but you will be laughing and asking, ""What just happened?"" over and over (keep the remote handy for rewind). Never in my life have I seen so many people being pulled or suspended by wires, or stuffed dummies being thrown against walls, etc... ...and The Watermelon Monster, who in the heck thought this thing up? You really have to see this movie my friends, even if you don't like fu flicks.

Things I Learned From This Movie:

Kung Fu defies all laws of physics, Einstein knew E=whatever the Shaolin monks decide.
Paper is a terrific insulator against fire.
Fat women fight by spinning or falling on you.
Asian girls say, ""I want to cuddle."" instead of, ""Hump my brains out."" but the result is the same.
Ladies: don't have sex in your deceased husband's tomb with the new boyfriend.
Getting a wine gourd jammed up your ass hurts.
Wearing a penis suit does not increase your fighting prowess and is likely to result in bodily harm.
Kung Fu requires ventriloquism.
People need their teeth in the afterlife.
Alcoholics never make it as wine tasters.
The Devil is susceptible to being smacked with 4X4's. (As in a piece of wood.)",1261008000,,3108,4.541071428571429
8030144,3,B0002OXUV0,"Rather spend your money on a different version of this film. The film itself is great, provided that you enjoy the type of humor which is showcased .. but seriously how could you not love the watermelon monster (aka the banana monster).

But the product is very flawed. My first complaint is the subtitles. I would have preferred the movie to be dubbed, as that is in the spirit of such old kung-fu movies to have them move their lips without the correct words coming out. But I can deal with subtitles, or at least properly executed subtitles, which these arent.

First of, there is the lack of black background for the white subtitles so they become completely unreadable every time there is a white or other light color in the scene. Secondly, at times you have to be a very fast reader to be able to get everything, since the subtitles have a tendency to disappear very quickly. Third, not everything in this movie is subtitled, so at times people are talking without subtitles. Fourth, the english used for the subtitles aren't exactly what you could call perfect english, as there's many times where flawed english is showcased.

Now if all the problems with the subtitles wasn't enough, the sound is enough out of sync to irritate the hell out of you (or at least me). A good kung-fu fight isn't the same if you cant here the hits and kicks, which you can't on this DVD. In the kung-fu fights the sound of a hit is first heard directly after one of the people have been hit, and that tendency continues all through the movie.

Throw in the lack of bonus material (as the only bonus material is trailers) and there is absolutely nothing to appease me.

My verdict is that this DVD shouldnt be bought, and people who really want this movie (which I did) should rather look for other releases of this movie, since the movie it self is definately worth seeing.",1099699200,4,1863,4.532738095238095
