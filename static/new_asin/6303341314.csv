This film is strictly for buffs of Airplane! type goofoff movies loaded with ridiculous sight gags and crude humor. This movie is not to be taken seriously in the least. It has absolutely no social redeeming value whatsoever,and if you are up for a barrage of nonsense then pick this slice of cinematic absurdity for your viewing pleasure.",1006128000,11,622,4.768518518518518
628034,4,6303341314,"It's him in a low budget but high laughter romp. Langston is a Los Angeles policeman who gets involved in all of the predictable low comedy situations by day and moonlights as the unknown comic with a grocery bag over his head at night. Everything works well for a while, until he's teamed up with Pat Paulsen (in his last notable role, and really his first funny one) on night patrol, when the cops are even less responsible. The humor is rank and generally wedded to sight gags ala Airplane and abundant body function jokes. Actually, I thought Langston's Unknown Comic routine was very funny. The whole movie is if, like me, your sense of humor still functions at an adolescent level. I recommend it, although not for those with sensitive attitudes.",998611200,8,752,4.704545454545454

I met the UNKNOWN COMIC in vegas once. Funny stand up comedian that will make anybody laugh. Neat to see NIGHT PATROL based on him.

The acting is pedestrian, at best. The picture is grainy. The editing is like a train wreck. The story line is contrived. The soundtrack (read: one ""song"", and a bunch of 80's synth interludes) could make a sane person wish they were deaf.

Combine it all, and you have a masterpiece. Yes, this movie is as bad as you remember it, and seeing it uncensored (I'm pretty sure USA is the only channel that ever showed this movie) makes it even worse.

You shouldn't laugh at anything this movie contains, but you will. You'll try to resist, but you'll laugh, and you'll feel dirty for it. In my mind, that's the mark of a fine comedy.",1163116800,3,790,4.404109589041096

628588,2,6303341314,"Here's a great idea. Let's take a bunch of washed up actors from the 1970s and early 1980s, and put them in a ""Police Academy"" style slapstick comedy. Then let's make sure to have HBO run the film on a perpetual loop for a year or two in order to convince an entire generation of pre-teens that our project is the height of hilarity. Well, why not? Jackie Kong's ""Night Patrol"" came out in 1984, at roughly the same time similarly themed films like ""Police Academy,"" ""Police Academy 2,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Airplane II,"" ""Bachelor Party,"" and ""Stewardess School"" swept cable audiences off their feet. I've fond memories, and I see I'm not alone, of kicking back during the hot summer months and watching these cheesy classics day after day on cable. And let's face facts: who among us can ever get enough of Steve Guttenberg, Judy Landers, Robert Hays, or any of the other second and third tier performers who appeared in these schlock films? The problem with ""Night Patrol,"" however, is the lack of second or third tier talent. What we've got here are celebrities from the 1970s one step away from doing dinner theater in Coral Gables or cutting the ribbon at a supermarket opening in Topeka, Kansas.

""Night Patrol"" follows the ""comedic"" adventures of one Officer Melvin White (Murray Langston), a nervous, skinny cop who can't ever seem to get a break. Right from the start of the film, we learn that no one respects Officer White. He pulls over some raving lunatic driving a car while wearing a straightjacket who promptly curses our hero out in French. Good old Officer White just smiles it all off and lets the guy back out on the road. Several other similar incidents follow, convincing us that Melvin is not only an inept police officer but also a blithering idiot. White's life suddenly changes when he's teamed up with a laconic cop named Kent Lane (Pat Paulsen), a ladies man prone to engage in equally stupid hijinks, to work the night shift. To make matters worse, Melvin doesn't know how to approach the gorgeous Officer Sue Perman (Linda Blair) for a date, nor does he know how to deal with the authoritarian precinct commander, Captain Lewis (Billy Barty). There's some nonsense about Melvin wanting something more out of his job than working the night patrol, but I don't really remember what it is. It's not important anyway since the paper-thin plotlines exist solely as a vehicle for the lamest sight gags ever imagined.

The gags fly fast and furious in ""Night Patrol,"" and they are gags in the truest sense of the word--as in gagging in horror at the pedestrian jokes in this movie. There are jokes about Captain Lewis's penchant for releasing a little--how to say this--hot air from time to time. There are jokes about Officer Lane's ability to bag the babes. While all of this nonsense unfolds with horrifying inexorability, we learn a few things about Melvin. While he's out patrolling the streets, some schmuck known as the Unknown Comic is making a killing at the local comedy clubs. Telling jokes that only a public of morons could truly appreciate, the wiseacre with a paper bag on his head also appears to be involved in a string of robberies. As the film goes on we come to suspect that Melvin White and the Unknown Comic are one and the same. Of course, you'll only experience this revelation if you watch the film from start to finish, something I strongly advise against. Your best bet with this film is to watch roughly the first half and then hit eject on your DVD player. For some inexplicable reason, the film radically changes focus about halfway through. Not that the first part is that great, mind you, but it's head and shoulders above the horror that starts midway through.

Most of the humor in the film, and I use that term loosely, is of a quality and sort best left unexamined here. I can say that topless women run about in nearly every other scene not so much for jokes but for cheap thrills, and frankly this movie needs whatever help it can get. Kitten Natividad's appearance, for instance, doesn't do much to move the plot along but does give the male viewer at least a minor respite from the banality on display. Pat Morita and Jaye P. Morgan turn up in minor roles that do nothing positive for their fading careers, and Murray Langston grates so heavily on the nerves that one wishes to reach through the television screen in order to beat the tar out of him. I'm essentially disavowing any knowledge of Pat Paulsen after seeing him in this dreck. Not that he had much of a career, anyway, seeing as how his main claim to fame was a couple of cheesy sketches on the old Smothers Brothers show and those runs for president every four years. I'm extremely disappointed to see Linda Blair trapped in tripe like this. Typecast due to her role in ""The Exorcist,"" she's spent the rest of her life trying to escape that movie's reputation. Don't give up, Linda.

I'm being slightly harder on this film than I should. I mean, I did enjoy it as a youngster, and I did find at least one series of gags funny when I watched it recently. This was the part where Melvin and Kent eat in that sleazy diner and their waiter kills a fly with a spatula, cleans one of the cop's knives by rubbing it under his sweaty armpit, and pulls that ""roach"" out of the soup. I chuckled faintly, but at least I chuckled once. The rest of the film is an exercise in endurance, and I again recommend giving this one a pass unless you need to prove to yourself how much of an idiot you were as a kid.",1121040000,,5514,4.572295247724974
628589,2,6303341314,"so - finally Night Patrol comes out on DVD and what do they do?  They mess up the beginning soundtrack by eliminating the extra commentary going on in the background skit, they give no extras or subtitles, they eliminate the bed scene which is the happy ending of the hero/heroine and most of all, THEY DELETE BLAIR COMPLETELY out of the final bed romp and play her giggles while the motion stop image stays there???? AND, to add insult to injury, they eliminate the Blair part of the credit bloopers - what is going on - if i wanted an edited version, i would have waited for it to come back on tv again - what happened to the integrity of original editions?

628590,3,6303341314,"I vaguely recall seeing Night Patrol (1984) on cable back in the 80's, and I'm pretty sure I thought it was funny at the time, and, with all the glowing reviews posted here, I thought it might be good for a few laughs.  It was, but being around the tender age of about 15 or so when I originally saw it, I think I was much easier pleased back then, as the movie just didn't do as much for me now as it did back then.  Have I grown up?  Certainly, but I am proud to say I still nurse a bit of my childish mentality, but even with that, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this as a really funny comedy, especially one as funny as films like Airplane! (1980), or the first Police Academy (1984) movie, which, if you read the back cover, you'll see these two films are used, incorrectly, as comparators.

The film lists a host or regulars from television shows like The Gong Show or the late 70's comedic game show Make Me Laugh (comedians had one minute to make a contestant laugh), among those Pat Paulsen, Murray Langston (his stick is the Unknown Comic, a comedian who wears a paper bag on his head, with three hole cut out, two for his eyes, and one for his mouth), Vic Dunlop, and Andrew Dice Clay.  Also appearing is Linda Blair, Jaye P. Morgan, Jack Riley (a regular on 70's The Bob Newhart Show), Billy Barty, Pat Morita, Bill Kirchenbauer, and Sydney Lassick.  The feature is directed by someone named Jackie Kong, who also directed various low budget stinkers in sci-fi film The Being (1983), the horror/comedy Blood Diner (1987), and the lame sex romp/comedy The Underachievers aka Night School (1987).

The film devolves into a plot regarding a character named Melvin White (Langston), a timid and ineffectual police officer who moonlights in comedy clubs as The Unknown Comic.  As his popularity begins to grow, he finds himself in a tough spot as his comedic career now interferes with his job as a cop, recently being switched to night patrol, but also there's a crook on the loose robbing various clubs using his identity by wearing a bag over his head, and telling really bad jokes.  Things come to a head as the police believe Melvin, in his alternate identity as The Unknown Comic, is responsible for the crimes, while Melvin tries to find the real culprit and clear his alter ego, all while balancing his two professions, and his two love interests.

Okay, let me just say I thought this movie started out pretty good, as it appeared to be just a series of unconnected gags, somewhat funny situations, and random silliness.  About a quarter of the way into the film, the plot listed above was more or less introduced, and things seemed to go downhill from there.  Now, I do like my movies to have a plot, but in this case, I felt trying to fit this in only hurt the film.  I suppose it is difficult to justify making a movie unless you actually have a plot, one that can fill 90 minutes of screen time, but I think they would have been better served here to have had less of a plot and focused more on the random comedic elements.  As far as the comedy goes, it was all pretty much toilet humor (the ever flatulent Captain Lewis, played by Barty...I swear, there was a `fart' sound effect like every five minutes throughout the film), feeble sight gags (`She really likes you.  She's got it written all over her face."", Cut to Linda Blair's character with the words `I Like You' written on her face), completely cornball jokes, offensive entendres, and just general bargain basement, infantile humor you'd expect to see in a crummy night club.  I did find a few things pretty funny, but I felt those moments quickly got bogged down by all the unfunny bits.  If you're familiar with The Unknown Comic's routine, you'll have an idea of the caliber of the comedy here.  I actually find him pretty funny, but the movie heaped on so much lameness it drew away from the few good parts.  Tastelessness abounds as the film sets out to prove itself an equal opportunity offender (I really didn't mind this as I despise `political correctness' in many of its' forms), heaping jokes on gays, lesbians, African-Americans, Asians, sexual assault victims, and just about anyone else you can think of...I didn't get the feeling it was meant to be intentional spiteful or anything like that, just more or less humor served up raw and unfettered.  I will say it did seem like the actors were just having a good time with themselves, as the film has not one serious bone in its' body.  Night Patrol does share some elements with the classic Zucker /Abrahams Airplane!, but while that film featured a more refined, wry, tastefully (for the most part) done brand of humor, Night Patrol offers a raw, unpolished, often inane sense of humor whose appeal is more or less of the pre-pubescent kind, or to those who appreciate `blue' humor that falls just below the point of actually being funny.  I will say there is one good topless scene in here with a blonde actress, another featuring the generously endowed Kitten Natividad, and a last, minor one featuring Linda Blair (use the `pause', that's what it's there for), for those of you keeping score.

Anchor Bay presents a pretty good-looking wide screen picture, but I thought the audio left a little to be desired.  The only special feature offered here is an original theatrical trailer.  In the end, I think Night Patrol is a film of very limited appeal, definitely not for children, those easily offended, or anyone who can't appreciate the more vulgar, crude, idiotic, childish side of comedy.

Featuring an amazing cast including The Unknown Comic, Linda Blair, Pat Paulsen, Andrew Dice Clay, Billy Barty, and Pat Morita(as ""Rape Victim""), this film made history upon its release in 1984 by pushing the standards and boundaries of bad taste in film comedy to new limits.  Thank you Anchor Bay for continuing to be the number one Cult DVD studio in the world and keep up the great work!""",1079740800,2,474,4.564705882352941
