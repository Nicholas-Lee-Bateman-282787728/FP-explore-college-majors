8171980,5,B000MTDRGS,"Its upsetting to find such awful reviews for ""Goddess of the Dark Tower"" (GDT), especially when the reviewers are fans of Japan and anime, but mediocre ones even if they've visited Japan. They may be called otakus, something that Japanese in general dislike, sometimes quite strongly among women, see The Otaku Encyclopedia. That book didn't dare to explain why but one reason is that some anime series for male teenagers are about legions of incredibly attractive women in desperate quest to win the heart of a jerk, a weakling or both, ""To Love Ru"" for example. But the Japanese themselves show ignorance about anime because anime has a truly awesome variety of topics.

GDT being part of the Ayakashi trilogy has a much stronger Japanese culture influence than average anime. The show that I watched by internet has a text at the very beginning encouraging the audience to see an additional file on the cultural aspects of the series.

Plenty of anime are rather cheap copies of American entertainment, especially action and fantasy. No wonder these otakus could not understand GDT at all. Delite Rancher even compared the animation and visuals to Hanna-Barberas 1970s style.

 The characters at the beginning certainly do resemble Hannas style: rather realistic human features instead of the excessive body features in anime, but they were an exception. Anime characters are portrayed realistically either when they are not the main ones in a show or when they play bad guy roles, such as the initial characters in GDT, a band of jerk bandits and an evil old goddess. In fact, GDT never fully uses the typical anime style of giant eyes, chopped-off noses and extra large hair, but anybody can still notice that its surely anime style. Its an anime style similar to Ghiblis, rather realistic body features.

GDTs animation reflects classical Oriental painting style, and this style is blurred. These otakus, ignorant as they are, thought that it was cheap animation! They may well think that the Oriental classical painters imitated impressionist style, if they happen to know it. Never mind the impressionists came at least a full millennium AFTER the classical Oriental painters. You should know that despite being blurred the Orientals still displayed great skill in their classical paintings, for instance check Early Spring by Guo Xi from the Middle Ages.

The best scene where you can appreciate the classical influence in the animation takes place when the main characters, Zushonosuke Himekawa and Princess Tomi, meet. Himekawa meets Tomi, a beautiful woman, when shes bathing naked in a lake. Yet the scene is not very erotic because its blurred, with strong focus in the whole environment, where these two future lovers are only a small part of their land, another feature of Oriental style and thinking. The American style focuses on specific objects or persons, not usually on the whole (Geography of Thought is a good study on this). The lake scene is still greatly pleasant, just like the classical Oriental paintings.

Deli also claimed the dialogue is flat, unlike the poetry from other not mentioned productions. Yes, this is a point off for GDT. I gave it 5 stars to compensate for the wrongful past reviews. Yet somehow most of the show is dialogue rather than action or fights, and the story still kept me stuck watching. It does have one insightful dialogue when Tomi expresses her doubts, anxieties and questions human ways. At the end the truly scary figure is not the group of ""forgotten goddesses""  who eat humans but the human ruler of the lands, Harima.

The end wasn't explicit, another feature of Oriental thinking. In their own environment  Orientals often expect you to figure things on your own  and may regard direct ways as dump and/or disrespectful. They reflect some of these trait in their productions sometimes. Still, GDTs ending was almost explicit. Again, ""Geography of Thought"" gives an interesting account into this issue.

My only complain about GDT is its current price, about $75. The problem with GDT is that it draws the wrong audience by being a fantasy-horror anime and then it gives them romance instead of horror. That's what I actually love most about GDT though, its romance. Serious audiences normally don't care about fantasy and its substyles such as horror, rightfully so. But it's also wrong to totally shut off fantasy. All of modern Western ""art"" sold for even millions is unrealistic, even when Western artists pretend to portray our real world in their own ways, normally twisted and way overrated.",1455753600,2,4564,5.022486772486772
8171981,4,B000MTDRGS,"Unlike the other two Ayakashi stories...this one is a love story ( for the lack of a better word),  It's not as bad as a lot of people of the web are saying...it's a interesting story and the ending is understandable if you think about it for a moment.

It's has seconds of being a little scary ( and I mean seconds), but all in all not a bad anime....You should try it out!",1376524800,2,374,4.04054054054054
8171982,3,B000MTDRGS,"This was fairly interesting, but didn't make a lot of sense at the end, actually, it was kinda' silly at the end.  But if that's the Japanese legend, passed down through centuries, who am I to judge.",1304553600,2,199,4.378378378378378
8171983,3,B000MTDRGS,"After reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lafcadio-Hearn/dp/0804836620/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lafcadio Hearn</a>, I developed an interest in Kwaidan. For the uninitiated, Kwaidan refers to old Japanese horror stories, often associated with ghosts and the occult. Also having a love of anime, the Samurai Horror series peaked my interest as a joining of these two elements of Japanese culture. While ""Goddess of Dark Tower"" falls short, it had so much going for it. The overall plot line is good and the Edo period always makes for great storytelling. Echoing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-Champloo/dp/B000FC2EXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai Champloo</a>,"" even the initial theme song is fantastic. So what went wrong? First, the dialogue is flat. Second, the animation is mediocre. There are moments when the artistic quality can be compared to what Hanna-Barbera was doing in the 1970s. As a whole, this series lacks the poetry and illustrated beauty that is found in better anime productions. Given these two elements, the Samurai Horror series may best be appreciated by younger viewers. After watching this initial volume, I don't intend on watching the other two DVDs. Samurai Horror has its moments but is ultimately uncompelling.",1230595200,2,1342,6.3791208791208796
8171984,3,B000MTDRGS,"After coming back from a recent trip to Japan, one of the anime DVD's that really stood out on the shelf for me was 'Ayakashi'. I'm a fan of old skool Japanese ghost tales and was pleased to find out this was coming out on DVD with English subtitles (as most are aware, it's near impossible to find a DVD with subtitles in Japan). I don't know if it was just the great packaging of the Japanese version which caught my eye, but all I knew was that I wanted it in my collection. Whilst I did enjoy the story line I was sorely dissapointed with the quality of the animation itself. The only word to descripe it is cheap. I could imagine that if this had higher production values it would have the potential to be one of my favourite animes...but I guess that could be said about a lot of series. I do like the idea of having just a short story line per disc. This whole tale is told in 4 episodes, which is what I'm led to believe is the format for this series, each disc is a different story. I would recomend this to someone who is more of a fan of samurai ghost stories than of anime itself. I for one will still be purchasing the rest of this collection but at least my expectations won't be so high so chances are I will enjoy the next one more.",1182470400,5,1248,4.09795918367347
