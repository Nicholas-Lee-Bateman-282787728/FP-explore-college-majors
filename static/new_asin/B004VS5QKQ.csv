8443945,2,B004VS5QKQ,I used to do a lot of Jaris' workouts and decided to try this one but wish I hadn't.  The routine just doesn't measure up to her prior DVDs' and the guy who does the gorilla walk should be embarrassed to present such a dumb exercise.  I won't be buying any more Jari Love DVDs'.  The Gilad step workout is much better.,1321574400,,318,4.096774193548387
8443946,5,B004VS5QKQ,"This video is what I have been looking for in a workout.  I love Jari's videos, my favorite was ""RIPPED! and Chiseled"" unitl I got this one in the mail :)  I love the compound exercises in this video, you talk about a workout, OH MY..this is it.  I did the whole 60 minutes and my heart rate was right up there like I was running 5 miles.  I was not able to stick with the whole leg workout that Adam teaches in this video.  I had to take a few break, but my legs were on fire.  This is a perfect video if you want to raise your heart rate but also build lean muscles. I am 40yrs old and the older you get, the more calorie burning activities you need to do in order to maintain your weight.  This video is it, burn lots of calories, and sculpt my muscles.",1309305600,3,756,3.9342105263157894
8443947,5,B004VS5QKQ,I have several DVDs from Jari Love and I enjoyed them all; but this one has become my favorite.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this DVD.,1305417600,,151,4.206896551724138
8443948,5,B004VS5QKQ,"Jari love is an excellent instructor. I've enjoyed most of her videos (some more than others). Revved to the max is two- 30 min compound movement weight exercise routines. The exercises keep your heart rate elevated, but not too much. I enjoyed the video more for a cardio/leg workout. The upper body portion is not as intense, but there are some excellent segments for upper body. One of my favorites is how she switches from pushups to tricep dips and then back to pushups, etc. You are doing pushups and dips for 3 min straight (30 seconds at a time). I've never done that combination before, and I LOVED it! A couple of my other favorite exercises were the squat off the bench with a shoulder press and then a tricep pulse with an extension. At first I was like ""oh this isn't that hard"" and then it hit me and became really tough! She has a new instructor Adam that teaches two of the segments. This is one of my favorite leg exercises. You have your toes pointed out, working the inner thighs and are doing pulses while also working your arms, then you do a gorilla walk, which is a killer, and then two arm lifts and gorilla walk back. This is such a great leg workout. Right after that, there is a whole other leg segment. I didn't enjoy the first exercise at all, which was a dead lift (Jari seems to do tons of dead lifts, and I just don't like them, nor think they are very safe for doing at home). I modify this by doing my own hamstring exercises. When she squats off the side of the bench to do a row, you don't know where to quite put your arms. It is just a little awkward. Just like a music CD, there are songs that I just skip past, and so I'll just skip past this first exercise. Most of the other ones were really good.

If you are a beginner to weight lifting, I would not recommend this video. She doesn't talk through the form as much as she does in her other videos. Also, at some points I saw some people swinging their arms, which could lead to a back injury. If you don't know very much about lifting, start with her get ripped and/or get ripped and chissled. These are two of the most basic, yet effective weight lifting videos I have seen that really show good form. If you are more advanced and want a great weight video, the get ripped slim and lean is by far my favorite. Some of her later videos I'm not as big of a fan of (although still good). The get extremely ripped video which is 30 min weights and 30 min cardio is good, and the weight section is very similar to revved to the max. I wish revved to the max had more sections in the menu so that you could select certain exercises. Some of her other videos allow that, and that is a really nice feature to have.

If you know how to lift weights, and need a cardio/weight workout in one, this is a great choice. It will keep your heart rate elevated, and you will feel the burn.",1305331200,2,2866,4.199637023593467
8443949,5,B004VS5QKQ,"This is a fantastic workout. I have most of the Jari Love Collection and this is by far the best and most effective workout I have ever experienced. I love the new way she mixes up the compound exercises. Your body works harder than ever, but it goes by fast and seems like it is easier to get through because it is not the same rep over and over and over. If you like any Jari Love video you will LoVE this one. I have done if for a couple weeks now and today I woke up feeling stronger and skinnier than I have ever felt.",1304985600,2,523,3.943396226415094
8443950,5,B004VS5QKQ,"Jari is back on track.  This video is much better than her previous Extremely Ripped videos.  There are many compound exercises and A LOT of leg work.  In fact, you are doing some kind of leg work in the majority of the segments.  No doubt you'll get your heart rate up and break a sweat.  This is definitely tailored for the more advanced exerciser. Modifications can be made for beginners, but this is still a rigorous workout. Don't be bummed if you don't make it all the way to the end or if you end up stopping or skipping parts because your legs are tired.  If you enjoyed Jari's first series, then give this video a try.  I was expecting another flop like the last few videos but was pleasantly surprised.",1304899200,11,712,4.3893129770992365
