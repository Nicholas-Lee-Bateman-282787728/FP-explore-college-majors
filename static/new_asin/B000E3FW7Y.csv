2485465,4,B000E3FW7Y,This is my family's favorite movie. I just transferred a VHS to DVD as it's unfortunately out of print and VHS tapes are becoming a thing of the past. It actually came out pretty good too! I've tried writing to MGM to inquire about a studio transfer but my pleas fell on deaf ears.,1301356800,2,281,4.222222222222222
2485466,4,B000E3FW7Y,"My wife has looked for this movie for several years.  I found it on Amazon and I am happy with it.  This is an entertaining movie.  Detective School Dropouts stars David Landsberg and Lorn Dreyfuss, two little known and under appreciated actors.  Most of the action occurs in Italy, with delightful scenes in Rome, Pisa, and Venice.

Basically, the plot involves a luckless man who keeps losing jobs because he  daydreams about being a detective.  He enrolls in a detective school administered by a private eye who is usually broke and unable to pay his bills.  Together they decide to  form a detective partnership and take a complicated case that involves three Italian crime families.

Detective School Dropouts is in the tradition of the Three Stooges and Abbot and Costello, two very funny comedy teams.  The plot is full of sight gags and ""slapstick"" humor.  One of the minor character reminds me of the English comedian (Eric Idle) who has ""accidents"" by continually running into Chevy Chase in National Lampoons  European Vacation.  I you like ""slapstick"" comedies you will love this film.",1293840000,3,1097,4.956043956043956
2485467,5,B000E3FW7Y,"Why won't the studio put this out on DVD? Here it is 2011, and I haven't seen this movie since the late '80's when it came out as a rental VHS, but I remember it well. The con man representing a ""detective school"", is able to deceive a naive out-of-work New Yorker into becoming a licensed private eye - just like in all the pulp detective novels he can't tear his eyes away from (hence getting fired from all of his jobs). Along the way, we get to meet a cast of absolutely hilarious characters, namely the obese, mean-spirited secretary of the school, the bossy old woman tourist that the teacher and his student keep bumping into (and annoying), the beautiful damsel in distress, and the Italian mafia! The car chase throughout Rome, the tower of Pisa, and the Vatican is worth the price of this film alone. The chemistry between the stars of this movie is great. I miss this movie and wish is was available on DVD!",1267228800,6,918,4.437869822485207
2485468,4,B000E3FW7Y,Searched for ages to find this movie and i must say i'm really pleased with it. Arrived in perfect condition too. Hadn't realised i had bought a VCD but it was still worth it. Recommend this movie for anyone who loves a good laugh.,1260576000,2,231,4.2727272727272725

2485482,4,B000E3FW7Y,"While Detective School Dropouts is not a comedy classic it does have some pretty hilarious moments. The acting isn't the best, the pacing is a bit off in parts and some of the jokes you can see coming a mile away but when it falls into being absurd slapstick comedy the movie shines. If you like old school comedy like The Three Stooges or Benny Hill you should give this movie a shot. It's got jokes for all ages and I think kids would get a kick out of the over the top silliness of the clueless main character and his money hungry mentor bumbling through his first case.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is into B-Movies with slapstick comedy.",1411603200,,652,4.344262295081967
2485483,4,B000E3FW7Y,"Not a classic in the sense of a ""great"", timeless movie, but VERY, VERY FUNNY!!!!! Wish they had made sequels. Love the plot and the characters.

2485484,4,B000E3FW7Y,"When saw this movie years ago thought it was hysterical. All the funny scenes were fresh. After its releash many of the funny scenes were used and reused in more popular movies until the funny is barely ""smileable. Detective School Dropouts didn't receive its props because, although the maker and stars of the movie, brothers were famous, they were not, plus it was a low budget film with little publicity given. I saw it by accident and it had me laughing even after it was over. If I were writing this review when I first saw it and none of the funny scenes had been seen before, I would have given it a four stars, but if were seeing it for the first time today would give it three stars. So split the difference and four stars is the stars of the day for this one.",1402531200,,769,4.273972602739726

2485502,5,B000E3FW7Y,"Stupid title? Yes. No well-known actors? Well is has Valeria Golino, but at the time she was unknown. But as far as comedies from the 80's go, this is a classic! It's a shame this movie wasn't released on dvd years ago. 2 American detective wannabes from New York solve a feud between 3 hardcore Italian mob families over cheese. How can you go wrong with that?

A friend and I were the only people in the theater.  I was pleasantly surprised as this is one of my all time favorite movie comedies ever.  Nobody famous is in it except maybe Tom Cruise's girlfriend from ""Rain Man.""  The writing, the acting, and the action are all outstanding.  I'm a movie comedy snob and I consider this the best unknown comedy of all time.  It took me years to find it on VHS and I wore out the copy I had.  Definitely worth seeing.",1364860800,,602,4.085470085470085

2485507,5,B000E3FW7Y,"My brother and I have been searching for this movie for YEARS.  Outside of a scant few showings on cable in the early 90's this movie has been very difficult to find...  Until now.

Thanks to Amazon and CreateSpace, you can now order a DVD copy of this movie on a DVD-R disc.  The order was filled quickly and we had our copy in a couple of days after ordering.

The Video Quality on the DVD-R is equal to a brand new VHS tape.  Clear Picture, no skipping or ""scratchiness"" running along the bottom of the screen.
The Audio Quality is fine.  You can hear what everyone is saying and the music in the film clearly.
Outside of a basic menu, there are no other features on the disc outside of the movie.  The disc comes in a standard DVD Case with a printed cover.
The DVD-R disc played perfectly in our Blu-Ray player and on our Computer.

If you are a fan of this movie, I highly recommend picking up the DVD-R copy!  The movie should be just like you remember it.  It was for us!

Thank you Amazon for making this rare gem available for everyone to enjoy!",1344988800,4,1055,4.22
2485508,3,B000E3FW7Y,"In 1986, actors Lorin Dreyfuss (""Skatetown U.S.A., ""Clerks"" (TV), ""Superman"" (TV), ""Fantasy Island"") and David Lansberg (""The Jerk"", ""Stanley"", ""The Love Boat"") joined forces to create the comedy film ""Detective School Dropouts"".  The two wrote the film and worked with director Filippo Ottoni (""Twitch of the Death Nerve"", ""Jona che visse nella balena"").

Despite the film becoming a box office flop, this film along with their followup film ""Dutch Treat"" have achieved a following because of its idiotic craziness.

Now, the film has been released via Manufactured on Demand (M.O.D.) as part of Metro Goldwyn Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"". Which is a program in which people request the DVD to be printed, than the DVD actually being printed and distributed to stores.  These films are targeting a niche crowd of fans who have been wanting these films to be released on DVD but the studio never did.  These MOD's, according to MGM, are made with the best source possible and most often, do not come with any special features.

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality of the discs. There are some who can't get them to play on various DVD players or on their computers and unfortunately, they literally become table-top coasters.

With ""Detective School Dropouts"", I can tell you that these discs are printed quite well with actual printing on top of the DVD (it's not a plain silver disc with letters). If you didn't know the disc was an MOD DVD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. But its important to remember that ""Detective School Dropouts"" is a 1986 low-budget film, the film does look its age, but definitely an upgrade over the rare VHS. As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital. Dialogue is clear as well as the '80s synth music.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Detective School Dropouts"" does not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Detective School Dropouts"" is one of those crazy '80s slapstick comedies that were popular at the time.  A film that I grew up with and have not seen for over 20-years.

And while the film did not receive the best reviews, nor did it to do well in the box office, it has become a cult-hit because it's one of those crazy comedies that you just don't see today.  Many comedy films today try to be funny and feature inept characters but with ""Detective School Dropouts"", it's not trying to be funny or dumb, it just is.

David Landsberg and Lorin Dreyfuss are a hilarious duo and although they only have made two films, ""Detective School Dropouts"" is one of those low-budget films where you wonder how they pulled certain things off in Italy.  At times, it seems their was no permit to shoot a film because onlookers were obviously not aware that a film was being shot.  And it kind of adds to the hilariousness of this film.

Favorite scenes include Donald and Paul stealing an Italian sports car and find themselves racing through the Italian countryside in fear as they are in shock of how fast the car is going.

Another scene shows the two dressed up as monks and start beating up each other in front of the nuns and priests, while curious Italian onlookers not sure what to make of it.

I also enjoyed the running gag of this older couple, the wife is constantly trying to be photographed by her husband in Italy, but each time, both Donald and Paul get in her way.

While I wish ""Detective School Dropouts"" have received a normal DVD release with special feature showcasing a reunion with both men and perhaps even an audio commentary, but I suppose that because the VHS has been out-of-print for so long, this made on demand DVD will do.

While I know this film may not be for everyone and it may be too idiotic for some, I'm all for moronic humor, especially comedies that are surprisingly silly.  ""Detective School Dropouts"" is an '80s comedy that is just hilarious, outrageous, moronic and fun!

For those who grew up watching this film or are quite nostalgic of this outrageous and crazy film, then this DVD is for you!",1335571200,,4320,4.6936339522546415
2485509,5,B000E3FW7Y,What else is there to say about this movie except how funny and awesome it is.  True genius. I have no idea why this was never made into dvd format and these 2 actors never did more movies together. Sit back and prepare to laugh.,1319673600,2,229,4.088888888888889

8105044,5,B000E3FW7Y,"I first watched this hilariously original movie when it first came out on video back in 1987 (theatrically released in 1986). Back then, the ""keytar"" and electronic drums soundtrack sounded ahead of its time, but finally getting a copy of this gem on DVD 28 years later- and even though the soundtrack is grossly dated - it brings back great memories of that decade's experimentation with music and farcical comedy. The story of two idiot detectives falling headlong into a serious mafia-type series of events is pure comedy, and this part of it is certainly not dated in the least. I'm a bit amazed that this film never got released on DVD before, and before I get all of your hopes up, it still hasn't... This DVD version is actually a print from the best video source available, and it is in full screen; no widescreen or Blu-Ray for this one unfortunately. The production group ""Cannon"" has long been out of business, and there's no telling if the rights will ever pass into someone's hands who will be willing to give this a true DVD release with all the trimmings it deserves. All of this aside, I think you will love this comedy and it is perfectly suited for the whole family. All of the characters are perfect, from phony detective school teacher and his bumbling student, who dreams of being a private eye after reading volumes of detective stories and getting fired from a series of jobs as a result of his obsession - all the way to the Italian henchmen that they unintentionally bump into and end up running from for their lives - all the while trying to save a young woman from being murdered so that she can marry the son of one of the three families fighting for supremacy in the international cheese business. Need I say more? The print is OK; not great, but it's pretty good. If you are old enough to remember renting used videos from Blockbuster back in the day, then you will know what I mean. There aren't any artifacts in the video and the soundtrack is amazingly clean, so this may be as close as you will ever get in purchasing a decent copy of this film before it transitions to the Public Domain, where the quality will end up as 12 generations of this print.

The film stars Lorin Dreyfuss, lesser known brother of the more famous actor Richard Dreyfuss (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, What About Bob?) and David Langsberg (Shoot the Moon, Love at First Bite, and many guest shots on TV Series throughout the '80's and '90's) as the nutty detectives. It also stars '80's beauty Valeria Golino (Rain Man, Hot Shots!, Leaving Los Vegas) and a host of other great character actors.

There is an incredible car chase that takes place though Pisa, Italy and then climaxes on the leaning Tower of Pisa. The back story of lost love between one family's top henchman and another family's ugly duckling daughter (who is being forced to marry into the third family (don't worry - this all gets explained really well) is in itself belly-aching hilarious.

I really recommend this film - available as it is on video transfer to DVD. Try to get a copy while you can. This one's been out of print for many, many years, so get a copy while you can.",1428883200,3,3171,4.54020979020979
