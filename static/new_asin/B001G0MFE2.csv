Just when I think I'm getting it figured out on 'who dun it' there's a plot twist that makes me go 'hmmmmmmm' not that person.

I knew from the first episode that I would be purchasing this DVD and I can't wait to get it!  I will be sitting down with my popcorn and Coke that night and watching it through without any commercials or other interruptions.

The writers and producers knew what they were doing when they put this show together.  AWESOME  JOB ALL!!!",1246406400,5,628,4.271186440677966
3593009,5,B001G0MFE2,"Up to episode 11 now and I have to say this show just gets better and better.
It started a little too soap opera-ish despite a couple of nasty murders and I wondered if I would stay with it but I am so glad I did!

With each episode it just gets darker and more exiting. Unexpected characters start dying at a rapid rate and other characters start to band together to try and survive. But with all the secrets this large of group of people are keeping it really could be ANYONE!

I am so excited for the final three episodes to find out who lives, who dies and who is the kiler.

And then I'm getting this DVD to see it all again!",1245542400,12,630,4.024

3593013,5,B001G0MFE2,"We are so hooked on this show it isn't funny, which must be a tribute to the writing and the direction.  The producers certainly know how to get you going, though it takes a few episodes before they can start reeling you in and playing you the way they want to.

At the very beginning there are too many characters--if you have ever seen Robert Altman's film A Wedding some of this will look familiar, but add into it a maritime setting, a fantastic yacht, and a culture of working class people trained to anticipate the needs of the wealthy, and you have a recipe for tension right there, and that's before you get the murders going.  The families of Trish Wellington (Katie Cassidy) and Henry Dunn (Christopher Gorham, often looking oddly like lean, lanky, nutty Anthony Perkins) invite you to a destination wedding, one held at Harper's Island somewhere in the Puget Sound, where you will be staying at the incredibly glamorous Candlewick Inn, but there will be plenty of time for slumming and seeing how the other half live.

Chief among the main characters is our heroine, played by Elaine Cassidy, the Irish actress who made a splash in Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey ten years back.  As Abby, the daughter of the local sheriff (Jim Beaver), Cassidy plays the tragic survivor of a mass murder that rocked the island seven years ago.  Could the killer, John Wakefield, thought to have been shot down by Abby's dad, still be alive?  Has he gone back to his ways of hanging his victims from the trees?  For many episodes Fate and the unseen killer arrange it so that one by one, victims die but nobody really realizes it, thinking they have just gone back to Seattle and will return for the wedding ceremony.  That got a little hard to swallow, but during this period we began to sort out who was who, who's sleeping with who, who resents the power of who, who seems irretrievably scarred by the earlier murders, and something of the sociology.  Now we know the characters and it hurts when one of them dies.

The show's gory in spots, soapy in others.  So violent is it that the individual episodes are named after comic book signifiers (""Ka-Boom,"" ""Thwack,"" etc) and after a few weeks you learn to wait for the act of violence each one stands for.  The ""Sizzle"" is particularly gruesome, though nothing yet matches the shocking death that takes place in the island's lovely old church.  I still get headaches when I think about that one!  Every clich of this kind of slasher film is rehearsed here, but expertly and often with a twist.  Even the one where a medium reads the heroine's Tarot cards and suddenly sees something in them too horrible to put into words and she runs out of the room mumbling, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" -Like the beginning of Agnes Varda's Cleo from 5 to 7!",1244073600,75,2787,4.6

3593016,5,B001G0MFE2,"As a former tv-show fanatic, I've been overexposed to cliffhanger shows that linger for season after season & stretch out plotlines until they're thin enough to read the evening paper through. When I heard that there was going to be a limited episode series (not a miniseries), I was immediately drawn to this show.

The series premise is about a wedding party that is being held on the fictional Harper's Island, an island that has it's own share of past horror. (Seven years before the start of the show, a homicidal killer murdered several of the islanders in an intensely gruesome fashion.) Several of the wedding party members were on that island, including one who was the daughter of one of the murder victims. As the series progresses, several people die (at least one per episode) and old skeletons begin to be uncovered. As things and people are shown to be not what they seem to be, the tension becomes more & more apparent through the series.

I personally loved this first episode. The episode starts just as everyone is heading to the island. Although everyone in the show seems to already know each other, there's enough backstory shown in the first few minutes to where the average viewer won't have a problem telling each person apart & getting into the story. The promised deaths in this episode are both pretty surprising, with one happening in the first part of the episode and the second occurring to one of the last characters I would have suspected. If this is the way the rest of the episodes are going to be, it may just restore my faith in the US tv programming!",1239753600,2,1588,4.647686832740214
3593017,4,B001G0MFE2,"Harper's Island is an experiment in limited run series on American TV, a format that is fairly common in international markets but not often seen on this side of the pond.

The show, which will run through July 2nd, follows a wedding party that is celebrating on a beautiful island with a terrible past.  The overarching plot is pure slasher flick, while the subplots tend toward the soapy.  The combo works much better than it has any right to, because I am hooked.

Another facet of the show's charm is the ensemble cast, which is a who's who of supporting cast from shows on the CW, Fox and the SciFi channel.  But don't get too attached to your favorites, because they're slated to be picked off one at a time by the mysterious killer.

The premiere episode won me over with its combination of creepy atmosphere and ""It's that guy!  I love that guy!""  As long as it stays this good, I'll be watching 'til the finale.",1239235200,6,920,4.467065868263473

3593091,2,B001G0MFE2,"I binged watch this show over a period of about a week.  It started out good and I liked the murder mystery premise.  Reminded me of the Agatha Christie classic ""Ten Little Indians"".  The show did have its boring parts and the 13 episode season could've been reduced to 10 episodes.  The action started picking up at episode 8 but became absurd towards the end.  Some of my favorite characters were killed off and it became a ""lone girl vs. bad guy"" showdown in the end.  Many of the characters, predictably, in this type of movies made some really stupid decisions that led to their deaths.  The ending was just too absurd for me.  This is an average show to watch if you have some time to kill.  It's better than season 1 of the Canadian TV show ""Slasher"" which was utter trash with an even more absurd ending.  Both ""Harper's Island"" and ""Slasher"" had a heroine with a troubled past.  I mean, it'll be nice to watch a murder mystery TV show where the heroine has a normal past and comes from a normal family.",1513468800,,1011,4.381720430107527

3593097,4,B001G0MFE2,"I agree with those who have noted the formulaic features of this series: a contained environment in which a group of potential victims are stalked by a mysterious and lethal killer. However, the action in this context is vigorous and often exciting (unnerving), and some of the characters become quite interesting as the story develops. In general the acting is good, and in several cases outstanding, and this adds substantially to the quality of the production. (A formula is not necessarily bad.)  For me the one bothersome weakness of the story is an underlying theory of psychosis that is not convincing, and it renders some of the action (particularly in the final segments) unbelievable, and thus not as 'scary' as I would prefer.
  I must add that the cinematography is excellent, and the setting is often gloriously beautiful (when it isn't dark and sinister).",1506297600,,869,5.020833333333333

The location that it takes place in is so scenic and beautiful.  I also appreciate that it was one season and  didn't try to draw it out like many of the shows I see now that start off great and then lose steam quickly.

3593116,3,B001G0MFE2,"I love these types of shows where there is a mysterious killer picking people off one by one. I do think this show is one of the better ones, so long as you can get past the obvious tropes and cliches. I feel if you can get past the classic ""people act stupid for the sake of plot"" thing that this show will be very enjoyable. It's perfect for watching at night time with all the lights off.

I did want to note that the pilot episode is so bad that I would give it an F. I actually almost didn't even continue the series because the acting was so horrible and it seemed like a cheesy direct-to-video slasher, however I'm glad I stuck with it as the acting gets better and better as the show goes on. Even by the second episode, it has gotten better.

First the good:
They do an excellent job of building over the course of 13 episodes. About half way through I remember wondering how they were going to continue for several more episodes, but it flowed very well episode to episode. Early on you may feel like there is a lot of filler, but in retrospect it was great to add necessary characterization. The groom's friends, while at first annoying, all turn out to be interesting characters.

The not so good:
There are several times per episode where I'd roll my eyes because the characters only did that stupid move so the plot could advance. It also gets laughable how often people just assume someone left the island without saying anything, even though that would never happen in real life. Again, they need to do that so the plot doesn't move along too fast, despite it having no basis in reality. Classic tropes to be aware of: thinking a missing person is safe despite knowing of murders recently occurring, constant splitting up to investigate in small groups of two or three, people not being able to shot someone with a shotgun at point blank range (this happened at least 3 separate occasions), a shotgun having one bullet and then being out of ammo (this happens multiple times), and the biggest one of all: people withholding valuable information or lying simply for the sake of plot.

If you have seen TV shows like LOST, Pretty Little Liars or the like, then you are already aware of this TV trope. There are several times throughout the series where characters either directly lie to each other without any given reason or they withhold information until it is a bigger reveal for the audience. There is a massive plot hole in the show where a particular male character has been telling a lie consistently for several episodes and then is randomly like oh I was lying, and they just move on like it's no big deal. That nearly killed the show for me right there. All that person had to do was tell the truth from the start and the entire series would have been different. The only reason he didn't tell anyone? Because they needed to advance the plot. No reason at all for that character to have been lying to everyone.

There is also a scene with a dog attack which makes zero sense within the context of the show. There was no reason whatsoever to that dog to have attacked when it did. It's meant to throw off suspicion to the viewer, but within the world of the show, there is no motivation for the dog's owner to have sent the dog after the people.

The ending (spoiler free, but don't read if you don't want to know anything about it!):
I hesitate to say anything about the end, but feel I have to after seeing so many posts where people said it was a shocking reveal. To me personally, the big reveal at the end of who the killer is was painfully obvious from the very FIRST episode. If you have a basic understanding of screen writing or story structure, it was clear who the killer was because so much of that character's story only works if he or she turned out to be the killer at the end. Otherwise there would have been no point to included various plot points. To make matters worse, IMO, they flat out confirm this character is the killer half way through. The other characters are just too stupid to realize it, but they flat out reveal it to the audience and then expect the audience to not know for the next several episodes.

One episode ended and I turned to my wife and said ""yup, I was right, they are the killer."" and then the next episode starts and it's like everyone suddenly forgot. Then, surprise surprise, that character turns out to be the killer. The revealed killer's actions in the final episode are nonsensical and a classic trope of the genre. I'd actually say the final episode is the worst of the series outside of the pilot.

It also bothered me that if you have seen a lot of slasher/stalker movies then you know by about the second episodes which characters will survive. There is nothing new or original, they are the exact tropes that ALWAYS survive these situations.

Overall:
So long as you are not bothered by the tropes that plague the genre, this is a very good show. It holds the viewers attention, has good characters and is a satisfying conclusion (not a cliffhanger). I'd recommend giving it a watch on rainy nights with all the lights off.",1492041600,,5107,4.453475935828877

What is the motivation for the continuing series of deaths?  Too many people disappear without a trace and without the wedding party acknowledging their diminishing numbers to make it very realistic, but it does keep your interest with a final denouement that brings the stories together.",1463875200,,666,4.954954954954955

3593595,3,B001G0MFE2,"This is the sort of thing I used to get really stoned to watch with my friends and giggle about how dumb all the characters are, but now I'm too old to get stoned and nobody wants to watch this with me so I'm not sure what my excuse is. Basically it's this: Beautiful people go to a beautiful place to have a party. The group shrinks daily due to various gruesome deaths, but nobody notices, so the party goes on with the baring of beautiful skin and some silly things to chuckle about. It's like a low-budget 80s slasher flick, but with a budget and a decent cast. The acting is great, considering what they have to work with, and some of my faves are in the cast but... the story is so... I don't know.  So annoying, but I... can't stop watching. It must be that I'm excited to get to the end and solve the mystery, which is pretty mysterious so far.",1462320000,,852,4.163636363636364

The only reason I stuck it out was to find out ""whodunit"" and even that and the very end was cheesy, think Lifetime movie. Very weak plot line surrounded by many, many, many, groundless, baseless and viciously bloody grisly killings. Such horrific, gruesome revenge murders which we are just to assume are justified.

3593679,5,B001G0MFE2,WOW!! One of the best thrillers I have seen. The story starts with a big marriage event and slowly it turns into a gory suspenseful serial murder ordeal. The acting of all the character are A class which makes us feel as if we are inside the story. As the episodes goes on the tension starts building up very slowly but steadily and it bursts in the last 2 episodes. The plot was chosen carefully so that it is very difficult even for a pro to guess the real killer. All the episodes were tightly integrated and I did not feel like losing interest at any point of time. A very nice thriller and deserves no less than 5 stars. Waiting for season 2 eagerly.,1459814400,2,655,4.248

3593726,1,B001G0MFE2,"Silly show, with a bunch of millenials dramatically running around an island as various murders take place. Indulged rich kids mixed with those whose families served them during the summer. History of murder on the island. It's not well done at all. Gratuitous suspense scenes that turn out to be nothing. Clueless characters with uninteresting stories. What a waste of time. Had I know that it was a CBS show instead of an Amazon Original, I don't know that I would have even bothered watching the Pilot. Give me more Bosch (Amazon) and Bloodline (Netflix) over this sort of junk any day of the week ... and twice on Sunday.

This is definitely not Alfred Hitchcock worthy.",1458432000,,674,4.760683760683761

3593942,4,B001G0MFE2,Harper's Island definetly keeps you guessing right to the last episode.  Who is killing off the wedding guests? I am generally good at guessing the killer before the end but I was fooled.  And up to the last fade out the suspense kept me wanting more. Looking forward to season 2.,1453680000,,280,4.470588235294118

3593944,4,B001G0MFE2,"Acceptable light-fare entertainment.  Thought they missed an opportunity to have a phenomenal whodunit.  The killer's motivations seems strained, somewhat silly and disproportionate to the grand scheme concocted to exact his revenge.  Solid cast overall, but underutilized in my opinion.  Very well paced and well shot.  But seemed as though the writers got lazy at the end and there were a few goofy moments with the killer.  Those goofy moments were akin to watching a B Horror movie--""don't go in the shed alone,"" and the ever-present and always annoying falling while fleeing the killer schtick.",1453680000,,599,5.319148936170213

3593953,4,B001G0MFE2,Lots of twist and turns. Sorry only one season could've been a good second season. The draw back very gorey,1453507200,,107,4.4

8303502,3,B001G0MFE2,"Double-edged sword in that it kept you pushing thru episode after episode to learn who the mystery killer(s) are.  A British-style whodunit, Nancy Drew/HardyBoys genre for the 14-25 year old set.  For the rest of us we didn't think it would ever end but had to stay the course to learn who dunnit!!",1526860800,,298,4.60377358490566
8303503,4,B001G0MFE2,"This series is definitely a little cheesy and predictable at certain points, but it is still so good!  If you watch enough thrillers, then you can guess what will happen next in certain episodes, but the final (huge) twist was done well enough, that I appreciated the overall series.  Watch the first episode and see if you like it.  If you get caught up in the mystery, you will probably end up watching the whole series.  Just saying.",1526860800,,436,4.551282051282051

8303507,2,B001G0MFE2,"Look, this had the most potential for a show that I have seen recently: it's shot in beautiful locations, people begin disappearing IMMEDIATELY, there's an old estate... The show fails because 1) it's a murder mystery that doesn't provide any clues to the actual killer 2) the killer the people believe it to be IS the killer and that person surprises everyone because the sheriff won't tell people the truth (groan) 3) the actual killer is boring 4) so many deaths are idiot deaths 5) once the killer is revealed, the show becomes super lame 6) the creepy child is creepy for no reason besides being creepy 7) the killer's ""surprise"" accomplice is lame 8) the accomplice's motivation is lame 9) the ending of the show is lame 10) people disappear from the island and everybody's all ""guess they must have left the island"" 11) no one acts like they're in danger. it's all very ""gee shucks. well, I'll go off by myself"" and other dumb decisions 12) side stories - the British doctor losing his ring, etc. - are unnecessary and annoying 13) ""Your future is so terrifying I have to leave immediately and tell no one anything!""",1525305600,,1123,4.648241206030151

I mean I understand why everything was supposed to happen the way it did and am glad that it got solved; but to lose so many favorite characters it always gets me right in the feels.  Even the final, final killing which I will not say to spoil it for anyone who has not seen the series in its entirety or not at all.  I love the series as a whole to see how it all comes together in the end is wonderful.  It keeps me intrigued regardless of how many times I have seen it.

8303509,4,B001G0MFE2,Odd but compelling mashup of soap opera/slasher flick/horror film and murder mystery. Great location and mostly good acting. Think Knott's Landing with a slasher. Does get a bit exhausting with all the kills and running from one trap to another but I give it 4 stars for its oddness and ambition. recommended.,1523232000,,309,4.961538461538462

8303511,5,B001G0MFE2,"I'm not typically interested in suspense or thrillers. Hack and slash films don't generally hold an appeal. This on the other hand was masterfully done. It's a who dun it story with constant twists and turns. The characters are likeable, the gor isn't over done, and while they don't really give you quite enough information to piece everything together (then again maybe I'm just slow) I never felt cheated. There is a surprising amount of blood for what was originally a television program, but they don't over do it. Overall I give Harper's Island five out of five stars. I only wish there was more like it.",1522368000,,610,4.710280373831775
