7357569,5,B012OTHK48,"Very good family movie.  No swearing which was a shock. It had some scenes of bullying which was good because it's an everyday occurance in our schools.  The most bothersome scene was a bully locking a boy in a box in the locker room. Our boys 11 an 12 loved it, as did we.",1457308800,,273,4.037037037037037

7357598,5,B012OTHK48,"I have always been an animal lover with a special affinity for mans best friend. So when I met Marshall and Cynthia Willenbrock at a video recorded interview by The Pembroke Pines Book Club and listened to Cyndi tell Marchells story for the first time, I knew I had to get this book as well as the movie DVD.

Marshall tells his story of how he was caught up in a really bad situation that nearly cost him his life. Eventually he was saved and found himself in a loving home. I could see in his eyes the way he looks at Cyndi that she is his world. Finally he has a home with affection and Cyndi does a great job of speaking for him.",1451088000,,633,4.064

7357603,5,B012OTHK48,"I was already a fan of the Marshall the Miracle Dog book and this movie is a fabulous next step to continue the Marshall experience. I just hosted a family holiday event and we made watching this movie together part of our new tradition. It was perfect for the whole family, even family members who usually can't sit long enough to watch a movie enjoyed every minute. It has just enough humor to keep everyone smiling and a meaningful story to reflect on afterwards. I'm now getting several copies so I can give them as gifts.",1448668800,2,526,4.489583333333333
7357604,2,B012OTHK48,"This is a slow moving movie with a mostly boring plot.  The acting was mediocre.
I had to fast forward the film several times just to get through the movie.
I don't recommend this film.",1448150400,,185,4.285714285714286
7357605,2,B012OTHK48,"I rented this video because of its high rating.  Boy, was I disappointed!  It proved to be like a low budget copy of a Disney film.  I suppose a lot of kids liked it, but I was quite bored.  Too bad...",1447891200,2,201,3.8292682926829267

7357614,5,B012OTHK48,"This movie is a GREAT movie for the family to enjoy together.  The message is solid and simple.  We should protect one another and that includes our animals. I believe it was Ghandi that said you can tell a lot about a nation by the way it treats its animals.

So get some popcorn and gather the family to get a good simple message - laugh some - tear up some - and applaud the ending.",1446595200,,385,4.0394736842105265
7357615,5,B012OTHK48,"A great story of love, hope and determination. This book is not just for children. As I was reading
the story of Marshall, I realized that not only did his owner save his life, but Marshall help his owner heal as well. A true testament to not quit before the miracle happens. Marshall is an inspiration to us all!",1446508800,,313,4.322033898305085
7357616,5,B012OTHK48,Wonderfully entertaining movie for the whole family with a great anti-bullying message.  I would highly recommend to parents with school aged kids. Watch as a family and use as a teachable moment for real life bullying issues that all kids encounter in today's day and age. Would make a great holiday gift or stocking stuffer. Must see movie...5 stars!!!!!,1446508800,,356,5.033898305084746
7357617,5,B012OTHK48,"Winner, winner chicken dinner!!! So refreshing to have such a wonderful family movie in todays day and age - with such an important message. Bullying is such a huge problem in our youth - it is important to have movies like this to share with our children!!",1446508800,,257,4.48936170212766
7357618,5,B012OTHK48,In a time when children are so vulnerable this movie holds a great message for many reasons. If you have been bullied / are a bully / have animals or maybe have to many animals this movie will help all of us with its message. We always need more ways to get these important messages out and this Author/ Producer demonstrates that she understands how to deliver this message in a way that people can relate to. I am really grateful that the DVD is out so we can give as a gift for many families this holiday season. The more the message gets out the better for all of us. Great way to pay it forward!

7357619,5,B012OTHK48,"I had the great privilege of meeting Marshall last February.  His story is absolutely amazing.  I am so glad the movie is finally on DVD so that I can show it to my students at school.  Marshall visited our school and we all fell in love with him,  His story helps students understand perseverance, courage, kindness compassion and hope.  This movie is near and dear to my heart, a great one for the family to view. I really can't say enough about it, a very useful tool for my character education program.  Everyone needs to watch this movie!",1446508800,8,543,4.489795918367347
7357620,5,B012OTHK48,We love the movie.  Just wish they would've released the movie earlier as we have been waiting for this  DVD for over a year.  Couldn't open it fast enough!,1446422400,,156,4.310344827586207
7357621,5,B012OTHK48,My children loved it!  The movie had great messages that we are constantly talking about with our young children--and we found there are follow up discussion questions we downloaded so we could talk about the movie as a family after--wish more movie makers did that!,1446422400,,266,4.911111111111111

8726402,1,B012OTHK48,"Hate to be negative, but this type of story typifies why people suffer through life issues.  First of all, any kid who's that wimpy and stupid deserves to be left behind and picked on.  And then getting mad because he can't get a dog is just typical American and 1st world brat mentality.  Oh, and hooking up w/ a veg-head is another typical spoiled and entitled snob thinking of this society.  This story is neither inspiring, spiritual, nor comforting.  Inspiration should be reserved for more substantial and meaningful issues.  Unless a person has seen and been through real important issues, a person would think that a dog and some pacifist lifestyle are real issues.  It was such an annoying story and characterization of the roles that I had to turn off about 1/2 way through the movie.",1526947200,,794,4.751824817518248

8726404,1,B012OTHK48,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in along time. I am amazed at the high rating; so much for Amazon's reputation. The acting was so bad it was like a high school production. Everything about the movie was bad, the plot, the script, the acting.
Don't waste 90 minutes of your life watching this.",1509148800,2,305,4.275862068965517
