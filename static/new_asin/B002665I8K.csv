3852254,5,B002665I8K,Great little movie for the younger set. Sean Patrick Flanery shines as both the Title character and the man that creates him. It is intertwined with cartoon and live action. Worth a look if you have kids or are a SPF fan.,1313452800,,221,4.285714285714286
3852255,5,B002665I8K,"First of all, where does all the hate and negative one-star reviews come from? This is a little gem of a movie, I caught it on one of the movie cable channels here in Europe. My 8 year old daughter loved every minute of this adventure comic book movie, as did I. Far too many contemporary adventure type movies rely too heavily on half baked CGI which can ruin any movie. Veritas on the other hand, tells a solid story with excellent CGI and sfx interspersed to drive the story forward. What is shown for example from the comic book world which is the home of the main protagonist in this film, consists of top notch animation. The director seems to have gone for quality over quantity. Also, the young cast is excellent which helps you get sucked into the storyline. All in all an excellent comic book adventure type film which comes highly recommended!",1271376000,8,854,4.516129032258065
3852256,1,B002665I8K,"This movie has really quite pathetic.  I rarely write reviews but had to on this movie-it is very very bad.  It may have passed for a made for TV movie in the 80's.  The poor acting is ridiculous.  Meaning no disrespect, Veritas' character acts very low functioning (IQ about 70 or so) or someone who had a brain injury .  He goes around doing things like screaming out at the airport ""I fly, I fly.  Veritas flies.  Just not in a plane."" In rainman tone.  His ""wings"" look like they attacked a group of maids at a convention then glued their dusters together, horrid.  Poor quality animation (you could make the argument they were trying to go for the ""comic book"" type of animation but it is horrid.  ALL the action scenes take place in an animation realm.  It is a simple and really ridiculous story (they save the world by drawing the comic book a certain way and then this awkward kid defeats the bad creature on his skateboard when the all powerful hero can not do it.  The guy never flies (just the animated version of him).  SPOLER ALERT: Do not read further if you want to actually torture yourself:  the end the mom and the boy who helps him end up going to live in the comic book world.  What?  Please spare yourself.  The only small population this may appeal to is a middle schooler who is absolutely nuts over comic books.",1263427200,15,1336,4.387755102040816
3852257,1,B002665I8K,This movie is only for those under the age of 11.  I collect all things super hero and this movie is not allowed in my collection.  Couldn't even watch it.  Horrible low budget waste of time.  FOR CHILDREN ONLY>,1260576000,10,211,4.333333333333333
3852258,5,B002665I8K,"The adventure begins when Kern, a misfit adolescent who escapes into a world of comic book heroes, is challenged to become a hero himself.  The 14-year-old is one of the last believers in truth and justice in the demolished inner city of Los Angeles.  Kern and his best friend, Mouse, are avid comic books readers whose favorite fictional hero is ""Veritas, Prince of Truth"".  Unfortunately, the lack of readership is causing the demise of the comic book.  Cancellation of the magazine however cannot go unchallenged by Veritas who decides to prevent his main adversary, Nemisii, from destroying his comic book world by ""entering"" the real world. He selects Kern to guide and assist him on his quest.  Mouse and  Kern find ways to help Veritas adjust to the real world in his search for the ""Biocode"" needed to rescue his planet.  Marty, Kern's mother, soon discovers the plot and is reluctant to believe the outrageous story.  Veritas, however, convinces her of his honesty and plight and the four of them set out on a quest to save Veritas' world, and find truth for themselves along the way.",1259539200,9,1093,4.807486631016043

8352139,2,B002665I8K,"This is not for adults at all, nor teens.  While there may have been a good premise for the movie and a cute idea of combining live action with comic book drawings the idea of making everyone - here comes the S-word - stupid!!! was a bad call.  Veritas is a intelligent super hero in the comic, but a virtual idiot on earth.  All adults are presented dim-witted and the kids not much better.  I'm sorry but this was really distracting.  The acting was also not very good.  The hero is Veritas, Prince of Truth and there should have be a good truth lesson in there somewhere to take advantage of the name.  The idea that his eyes glowed when someone lied was not sufficient.  The story revolves around a young boy who wants to be a comic artist when he grows up.  He brings a comic book hero into this world to fight a villainess who has come here to steal a special code that will make her invincible.  All action is done in animation, which isn't a bad idea.  Good intent, but it didn't make it.",1412467200,,996,4.24468085106383
8352140,4,B002665I8K,"I wasn't sure if this would be stupid or not, but fortunately, ""not"" won the day.  A great story for those who want to instill positive values into their children, or (as an adult) just watch something that doesn't depress or leave a bad taste in your mouth.  There's a nice mix of ""reality"" and animation.  Recommended for children of any age.",1396310400,,344,4.516129032258065
8352141,2,B002665I8K,"I could only watch maybe about a half hour of this movie. Not one character had grabbed my attention and the idea of the movie did make me want to try, definitely different but it just plodded along.",1393200000,,199,4.2631578947368425
8352142,4,B002665I8K,"This is just a goof fantasy film. The main bonus fo me was Amy Jo Johnson,  the original pink ranger & by far the hottest in my book.",1374278400,,133,3.75
8352143,3,B002665I8K,"Okay I HAD to get it because SPF and for the name alone. And the story sounded so good.
Unfortunately the movie is not so good. I don't mind the cheap effects, I have imagination. But:

Veritas is a superhero and even if this world is weird to him, he would be strong and grown up. In the movie he is like a 3 year old instead of a superhero. The clothes they put him in.... oh no.... and the story is not really flowing.
I would love a remake still with SPF, only with a better director and creative department and a better script.

3 Stars for SPF making a movie for children and for wearing wings. And for the name. <3",1366934400,,621,4.040650406504065
8352144,4,B002665I8K,I saw a short portion of this film prior to purchasing for a kid. I was impressed with the portion that i saw and upon recomendation from someone else i purchased it.  So far i think the kid is please.,1325462400,,201,4.025
8352145,4,B002665I8K,"As one can tell from other reviews, not an adult offering for adults who are into superheroes. It's perfect for kids though. Good social positions on truth and bullying and trusting one's dreams and (earthly) powers.

It's a nice little movie for that age group, exciting to them. Good for imaginations.

I could give an adult review and discuss all kinds of technical issues like continuity and probability within context. The wings. But the target audience is not one that knows or cares about these things. My 13 yo boy thought the wings were beautiful. The wings hit right into a childhood archetype of having wings and fantasizing about flying.

When I watched it, I was very well aware of the wings's inability to lift the mass, and that they weren't very well done. So what?

If your children under 15 aren't cursed with too much cynicism, I think they willenjoy it.",1316563200,,873,4.723684210526316
