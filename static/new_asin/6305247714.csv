I have a *much* better understanding of the belief  systems that underpinned the logic of Hitler's Germany, and understand that  a) he was not alone in his fanatacism and b) that these belief systems did  not originate in Germany nor did they end there.

1004056,3,6305247714,"This set includes four videos, each approximately 50 min. long. The titles are; The Enigma of The Swastika, SS Blood & Soil, Himmler The Mystic,  and Adolf Hitler. They are really informative documentaries showing a brief  history of Occultism in Germany and Europe and it's influence on the  National Socialist philosophy. Each tape tells of the rise of the Nazis and  how the different aspects of the movements ideology and rituals are  actually related and derived from the occult teachings of many different  people and places. Although much of the information is often repeated on  the different tapes, there is an abundance of it which is interesting and  also at times disturbing. It tells of occultist followings that are both  ancient and recent and how they influenced the ideology of the most  notorious political regime in Europe's and possibly the world's history.  The only negative thing is the aggravation you are sure to have in  adjusting your tracking for a clear picture. The sound is also very, very  poor. I had to hook-up my VCR to my stereo and set the volume to maximum  level in order to hear anything. There were still times I found myself  rewinding again and again trying to decipher what was said at the barely  audible parts. The mode these are recorded on is EP (Extended Play). For  those of you that don't know what that means, it's used to get the longest  possible time out of the tape. Unfortunately, this also tends to mar the  quality of both picture and sound. Still, despite this, I don't regret the  purchase. I would have awarded 5 stars if not for this.",965606400,6,1597,4.738181818181818
1004057,1,6305247714,"Seekers of something substantive or interesting are bound to be disappointed by this cheap and poorly edited series. Someone stumbled upon a lot of public-domain footage and tried to make something ominous from it. Innaccuracies of occult references are profound and misleading (e.g., that H.P. Blavatsky was the source of the ""master race"" idea as Hitler envisioned it, etc.). As a student of the occult, I was at first bored (there IS, in fact, MUCH to say about the relationship between the Nazi's and occultism which this series completely avoids) and then disturbed (the insinuations are not only inaccurate, but wrong.  Ariosophy and Thesophy are two VERY DIFFERENT strands of belief, and the videos make no distinctions).  There is an excellent documentary waiting to be made out there, but these thingies are not it (as much as the subject matter is interesting, I  must stress that most viewers will be disappointed.  It really IS stock-footage with voice-overs).  An infinately better, more reliable source on the topic is Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's stimulating book, _The Occult Roots of Nazism_ (NYU Press, 1992). There is ample ""occultism"" to be found, but seekers of racial purity and demons will be disappointed in both book and movie (evil is human--occult or not).

But it did exist, and this series is as good an examination of this rather  esoteric topic as I've ever seen, certainly far better than the History  Channel's recent effort.
The presentation is rather dry, and the video  footage can be somewhat repetitive.  But if you're interested in early  20th-century European occultism and its contribution, however slight, to  the rise of Nazi Germany, this is as good a source of information as there  is, apart from Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's book The Occult Roots of Nazism.",946512000,11,658,5.1415094339622645

By focusing on the relationship of the Third Reich to the occult, it makes it appear as if the occult were the only source of Nazi ideology. Actually, important sources of Nazism lay in political theories that are ignored in  this documentary, and some Nazis were far less interested in the occult  than others.

1004158,1,6305247714,"The series repeats the same lines, using the same footage again and again.  The information contained is not referenced and comes across as over the top propaganda - unfortunately all too failure to those who frequent the History Channel, et al. For example, we are supposed to accept the Nazi's were to blame for the mass murder of Polish officers and inteligencia, yet the truth about that has been out now for over a decade.  The Soviets admitted it on 13 April 1990.  It was covered up by both the Soviet Block and the West for decades, although many knew the truth as long ago as 1943.  For the same lies to be included in this documentary is just astounding.

I am not an expert on the Occult history of the Nazi's but neither are the researchers for this series.  Some of the claims are so outrageous as to be highly improbable.  Another example, apparently to join the SS you needed to prove your family ancestry back to 1789!  This in an age before ancestry.com!  Now call me naive but I simply don't believe that it would be possible to recruit over a million men that way.  We all know the Nazi's were bad but stupid, insane and bad, no.

The final part of the documentary ended with the torchlight ceremony where the torchbearers formed into the shape of the swastika.

1004161,3,6305247714,"The visual treatment is not lurid, but the mood certainly is, and for the wrong reasons.  If you are genuinely interested in the material of which these documentaries treat, read the books by the well-respected scholar Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke.  There are curiosities here, such as the usage of the terms ""clockwise"" and ""anti-clockwise"" for the directions of the swastika; does not the Hacken face INTO the direction it is going?  Therefore this film's usage is backward.  As usual with documentaries as compared with good scholarship, these movies are primarily interesting for the photos and film footage a book can't provide.

From the point of view of cultural authenticity there is something very disturbing here - the films are given a strange spin by the misuse of the music in the soundtrack.  We might expect the Holst ""Mars,"" but in this case the iconography is invited, and general enough not to specifically Nazi.

But quite a bit of the time, the music here is by, of all people, Igor Stravinsky and Bela Bartok.  Aside from the fact they were  on the other side than the Nazis, and the fact that the Nazis persecuted them and all music like theirs, their ""Modernist lite"" styles are accessible enough to be used in film, but serious enough in tone, relative to other films scores anyway, for unsuspecting watchers to think this music is ""appropriate"" to the subject of Nazi occultism.

But listen to the pieces themselves - the ""Symphony of Psalms"" is hardly a pro-Nazi essay,  and ""The Rite of Spring"" is in no wise Nazi.  It is interesting that those of Stravinsky's passages mined by the light-fingered Mr. John Williams for the Star Wars movies aren't used here - so the blatant use by Williams of the Rite's famous repeated string chords, from the beginning of ""the Augurs of Spring,"" just at the moment Darth Vader first appears walking through the blasted-out wall in Episode Four, does not appear here.  In other words, the producer here did not choose any Stravinsky that would step on Star War's toes.

The use of the beautiful ""Night Music"" from the Bartok ""Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta"" is another chopped-up travesty, just as it was in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining.""  There ought to be laws against this sort of thing.  In a better world, there are.  One feels civilization is raped by this misuse of musical masterworks just as surely, though unfortunately not as detectably, as the Nazis themselves systematically raped the world.  Knowing now what is in these documentaries, I would watch them with the sound off, with less intrusion into the learning process. If the musical choices had been appropriate, this special would merit more stars.",1321488000,2,2689,4.924611973392461
1004162,5,6305247714,The information was factual and accurate. It gave a good review of how men can be manipulated by a few bullies.

1004163,5,6305247714,"Well here we are introduces to a different view of the Third Reich. Why haven't we seen this before? Evidently this aspect of Nazis was not as interesting as weapons or fascist ideology. However I have seen this film several times on history channels and even on public television. And it does bring up new questions as to how it all started?

Well some would say they knew all about it and that, and this film is just a glossy version with stock footage. OK, find me a film on the subject that is not glossy and uses unique footage. If you really have more than a passing interest then it is book time, such as ""The Occult Roots of Nazism"" ISBN: 0814730604.

1004164,5,6305247714,"The ""Occult History of the Third Reich"" is a very well made documentary. Even the repetitive passages play their role correctly - they show how the same seeds give birth to leafs, branches and the trunk of the phenomenon, called the German Nazism. After all this is a popular documentary, not an academic exercise.
""Enigma of Swastika"", ""The SS. Blood & Soil"", ""Adolph Hitler"" are the parts of the documentary and in my edition I do not have the part on Himmler.
The documentary tells us about the occult roots of the Nazi ideology. This subject is of course interesting, and the depiction is well done. From the theosophy of Russian Helena Blavatsky comes the idea of the Aryans, the race preserving the culture, and from the romantics of the German past, Guido von List and Richard Wagner, comes the mystical admiration with archaic pure Germans. These things were eagerly absorbed by the Nazis, became the backbone of their faith.
But what is very impressive with this documentary - is that it brings to us the zeitgeist of the beginning of the 20th century in the scope of races and nations. It highlights several things that we are used not to know or are used to easily forget:
The ideas of racial inequality, racial heritage and racial supremacy were not at all the invention of the German Nazis. These ideas were widespread in Europe and all over the world. Our own racism was about white-black (colored) relations, but the European racism was more diversified, elaborated and had strong cultural and mystical nationalistic components.
Racial inequality at that time was not some tabooed idea, released by Nazis, but a common knowledge, a regular subject of studies, a regular part of life.
The breed inequality among people was not considered a heresy. On the contrary - the equality was considered to be absurd. And the best proof of that was coming from the science and Darwin.
The imperialism was not considered to be shameful, but a kind of obligation of whites (in the case of the British) or the Aryans (in the case of the Germans) to subdue and rule the second sort races and nations.
The Germans were not the crazy among the normal. They were the true believers, placed into the chaos; and from that chaos had to crystallize either the Communism or the Nazism. The racism was quite common in Europe, and the communism was very much feared. The racism embracing Nazis took over.",1254441600,3,2394,4.771084337349397

1004242,5,6305247714,"I owned the 4-tape VHS version by Madacy since about 1999, and consider David Flitton's work to be a masterful tracing of the steps, the influences, the convergence and the culminating rise to power of one of the most sophisticated yet pagan regimes in the history of western culture.

  As an historian, I confess to taking detailed notes on about the third round of watching these films, and traced person-to-person, philosophy-to-philosophy, publication-to-publication, movement-to-movement, and link-to-link, and found myself with a veritible map of converging streams of influence which became the flood-tide of Naziism.

  I have a personal library of over 3,000 volumes collected over 25 years of professional career, with about 25% dedicated to Theology, 25% to Jewish/Church/Religious history, 25% to American and World history, and about 25% to Military history, with other subjects tangent to all these.  My WWII and related items number in the hundreds, and the subject of the Third Reich and the Holocaust number in scores.

  I relay all that book blather to assure the reader here that I have found these videos to be an accurate presentation of the subject matter, making many obscure and little-known documented FACTS not only come to light, but to be placed in a very proper context for the understanding of the subject.

  In addition, the treatment of the matter is succinct in comparison to what enormity of evidence exists, so it is easy for a novice to view these films and get a good handle on the subject of the ""spirituality"" behind the rise of the Nazis.

  On the other hand, scholars who have researched the matter for years as I have will thoroughly enjoy seeing what will likely be new film footage for them---footage which I was pleasantly surprised to discover still existed.  Scholars will also appreciate the interesting and commendable way the producers of these films crafted them, so as to be reminded of a multitude of the most important points from the various books and records in print one has already researched.

  I highly recommend these films to every high school and college in America and Europe, and for all historians to view these films and refresh themselves as to the reasons, thought-patterns, and movements which led to the national decay of one of the most sophisticated and cultured peoples on earth, and led them to blindly submit to pagans leading them to complete disaster.

However view these for yourself, correlate the extra info with what is known, delve into some secret society stuff, and see what you think.

Currently, I see enough evidence of a continuing ""Reich"" to take it all a bit more seriously than some folks who would discount the information.  Ever wonder if Hitler was as much a tool as a Despot?  Regardless, these documentaries will give a little insight into some of the Symbolism and Ideology of Hitler's Third Reich, and you might accidentally make some connections with historical information.

1004246,5,6305247714,"I experienced this as an absolutely stunning set of DVDs.  I did not already know that a huge occult movement was going on in Germany way long before WWII and that Hitler just got picked up by it and added on for effect.  Well, I had heard vague rumors along those lines, but this documentary spells it all out in real detail.  It ""names names"" - and even shows the person's picture.  The documentary is a huge effort pulled off with great style by people who must have done endless hours of work on it.  When a certain speech or historic event is mentioned, there is film.  One sad thing about all of this is that poor Madame Blavatsky ended up taking the blame for much of it.  The Nazi occultists figured that they were bolstering their claims by attributing them to Blavatsky, which is ridiculous, but they got away with it anyway.  Blavatsky died in 1891 and had nothing to do with WWII.  What she started was the Theosophical Society, which is (and always was) an extremely peaceful and high-minded organization.  In any event, this set of DVDs is an excellent piece of work.  The alleged Blavatsky connection is not dwelt on, but the Nazi ""prophets"" who falsely claimed to be connected with her are.  The whole story is laid out showing how over a long period of years occult societies grew, gained power, and eventually got control of the country. The leaders surrounding Hitler were members of the occult societies.  Hitler himself had been ""discovered"" by them and was more or less hired by them.  They even sent him to special public speaking classes to get him ready for role he was to play.  A stunning story.  All presented in detail with facts, names, dates, and so on - and with tons of film that I am surprised to learn is in existence.",1169078400,6,1753,4.517460317460317

I'm no expert, but I disagree that the content is ""not just wrong, but inaccurate.""  I thought the content was basically the same as in Goodricke-Clark's book.  And this movie predates that authoritative work by 5 years, so the filmmakers were doing pretty well.

Predictably, the narrator is English and he does use the word ""madman"" a lot.  Hey, there are admittedly a lot of madmen in this story, but the people who make these WWII docs could still benefit from a thesaurus.

If there's problem with this series, it is that there just isn't enough information.  It isn't until six minutes into the first episode that ""the occult"" is even referenced, and the third episode -on Himmler- doesn't mention his name for the first twelve minutes.

1004249,2,6305247714,"The narrator for the film ruined much of it for me, not to mention a discursive storyline that leaves one in bemusement and disgust.  Once again, here we have a ""religiously"" motivated look at history instead of indifferent reporting and plot summarization.  The clips showing just how many people in Germany rose in anticipation of a different country, one not bound and choked by Bolshevism, and also one not having to pay ignomious credence to Catholic ideology.  The narrator is infuriating as he goes along blaming people from all parts of the geopolitical spectrum (English natural selection, Blavatsky's mysticism, anti-christian traditions) except for the biggest culprits of all: Where is there any talk of the pigs in Rome who backed Musolini?  Where was the Church in stopping this dictator?  Instead, the author likes to accuse Germany of every misdeed under the sun, then sneaks in cheap-shots against coutries and people who were not at all a factor in the rise of national socialism.  The ""undermining of truths held sacred for all time"" was an arrogant, pompous act of skullduggery; the makers of this movie do a great injustice by not emphasizing how the past (not just WW1, but roman conquests, mongolian invasions from the east, etc.) invasions and mistreatments of Germany aided in fueling the fires of national frustration and national pride.  Germany, for all it has done for mankind (inventions gallore, philosophy, art, engineering) would be interpreted after watching this filth as being nothing but a whacked out country of occultish fools.  Wrong!  The Vatican just never learns: When you try to control and demonize entire nations, it comes back to haunt you.  But then again, how many Vatican pontifs and cardinals died for freedom in WW2?  Few compared to the many others who perished, and why?  Because the Vatican, whom are supposed to be helpers of humanity, decided it best to take a ""neutral"" stance to fascism!  While WW2 should have ended with a peaceful and united Germany, its result was awful for everyone involved.  Millions of Russians dead, Italians dead, Americans dead, Germans dead, Jews (many nationalities) dead, Gypsies dead, Hungarians dead, Japanese dead, Poles dead, English dead...but in retrospect, the Vatican never lifted a finger in effort to stop the growth of fascism in Italy, Croatia, Hungary, and elsewhere.  The makers of this deceitful film leave all viewers a false impression; placement of guilt at the hands of esoteric, uninvolved figures makes this rank.  The Vatican is so terrified of Skull & Bones, The Templars, and any other secret society formed to end Catholic oppression!  Does the narrator ever tell you that?  Indirectly, but only when depicting ""Templars"" as evil and Catholic figures as absolute good.  Ha!  The epitome of bad WW2 coverage comes interstingly enough at the very end of the ""Swastika"" volume: painting the Templars as a Teutonic order set out to dominate the world as some twisted backdrop supposed to tie in with our future, today.  Last Words: northern Europe endured heavy prices (economically and in human lives) and freedom-stealing orders via Rome for far too long, and hence were formed groups whom enlarged to ""orders"" whose explicit purpose and goal was to stop Catholic thugs.  The Vatican has been knocking-at-the-knees ever since Bush Sr. began speaking openly of ""New World Order"" -something the Vatican sees as and knows is a challenge to its lies and corrupt dealings with north Europe - a part of the world that has issues and scientific endeavors far more vital to its happiness and health than Vatican make-believe.",1118188800,10,3629,5.104906937394247

There are four separate programs:  ""The Enigma of the Swastika"", ""The SS:  Blood and Soil"", ""Himmler:  The Mystic"", and ""Adolf Hitler"", as well as a separate special feature ""Ask the experts"".  In total the DVD runs for over 3 hours.

""The Enigma of the Swastika"" tells the tale of the origins of the swastika as symbol of National Socialism.  It begins by noting a period of decline in traditional hierarchy, authority, and religion, and a rise in industry and finance at the beginning of the twentieth century.  This decline was not greeted warmly by all those who lived at the time.  To compensate, various counter-myths and restorationist schemes were proposed.  In Tibet for example, the swastika had long been used as a traditional symbol for good luck.  The Russian seer who allegedly visited Tibet, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky proposed that the swastika was the symbol of the Aryan root race.  Later, Guido von List, a Germanic mystic, influenced by the ideas of Blavatsky wrote of the lost Teutonic race who worshipped Wotan and referred to them as Aryans.  List also was to make use of the swastika as symbol of the Aryans.  In the Great War, the swastika became a talisman worn by soldiers.  Various secret societies such as the Thule Society, which operated behind the NSDAP, run by Rudolph von Sebottendorf, also made use of the swastika.  When Hitler came to power he incorporated a straight-armed and anti-clockwise swastika as the symbol of National Socialism.  Also, Alfred Rosenberg, a Nazi philosopher, and the SS were to use the swastika as their own special symbol.

""The SS:  Blood and Soil"" tells the story of the SS guard, an Aryan elite and supposed ""brotherhood of Templars"".  The SS was commanded by Heinrich Himmler who developed a profound nostalgia for a lost aristocratic elite.  Other figures who believed in a hidden elite or hidden masters included Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, and List.  Various secret societies including freemasons, the Rosicrucians, the Jesuits, and the Templars served as models for the SS.  The SS wore a special ""death's head"" insignia.  A system of racial hygiene and eugenics was instated in Nazi Germany so as to breed the Aryan superman.

""Himmler:  The Mystic"" tells the tale of Heinrich Himmler's infatuation with the occult.  Himmler began his career as an agriculturalist leading him to stress the importance of the myth of ""Blood and Soil"" as well as the necessity of Lebensreform.  Himmler also was involved in astrology, spiritualism, and herbalism.  Himmler commissioned a special bureau of SS archeology, which sought to rediscover lost Aryan civilizations.  Karl Maria Wiligut served an important role as an occultist for Himmler's SS.  In addition, Himmler sought out Wewelsburg castle as the spiritual center of the SS order.

""Adolf Hitler"" reveals the secret history of Adolf Hitler and his involvement with the occult.  Hitler read the writings of Jorg Lanz who published Ostara and advocated a system of theozoology.  In addition, Hitler was also influenced by the Englishman who praised Germanic culture Houston Stewart Chamberlain and the composer Richard Wagner.  Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi philosopher, made popular the notorious ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" which influenced Hitler's rabid antisemitism.  This program shows the destruction wrought by the Third Reich, the use of eugenics, and the death camps.",1105056000,42,3568,5.165794066317627
1004266,3,6305247714,"Although the research on this series of DVDs is rather thin, it should not be dismissed out of hand as some have done. The names of some of the occultists that are thrown around are monumental individuals. Did they influence Hitler, Himmler, etc...? Maybe...maybe not, but to dismiss wholesale is not the way to find answers to difficult questions about a period when it is easier to just villify and condemn. While the research on these DVDs is thin, it could prove an interesting starting place to find more about occult influences from the Fin-de-Siecle to the Second World War.",1094515200,14,581,4.82
1004267,3,6305247714,"Hitler and the occult... a nonexistent collaboration (...) Consult Hitler's own words, where he slammed the occult as ""Jewish and Bolshevik.""
This is a difficult video to review because its premise is flawed from the get go: there is no occult associated with Hitler and there never was. The people chosen to be interviewed in this unintentionally amusing documentary are (...) of the first order. None are respected, noted or competent historians, they are pop writers who believe in errant nonsense. What types of nonsense, you ask? I shall tell you: they believe that when Hitler was a young man living in Vienna, he stumbled upon a spear located in a local museum. The spear infused the young artist with mythical and evil ""powers."" Yeah, right... and I was abucted yesterday by Martians and taken to outer space.
Only the most gullible [viewer] could believe anything in this childish video. Errors of the most fundamental nature abound: Hitler did not emigrate to Munich in 1912, but in 1913; Dietrich Eckart did not die in 1945, Hitler did not meet Eva Braun in 1933... the list is endless. As a laugh this might be useful, as history it is unreliable and puerile in the extreme.",1083369600,11,1186,4.818627450980392
1004268,1,6305247714,"This set borrows heavily from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL and from the Wolper Documentary RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH, using washed-our film resources.  The set is made up of three discs which purport to concentrate on Adolph Hitler, the SS, and the swastica, but they instead overlap each other, using padded and unrelated material, concentrating heavily on the holocaust and using stock footage from television.  Overall, very disappointing quality.",1036800000,9,448,5.295774647887324
1004269,4,6305247714,"First off there is some overlap of material, secondly the quality of the duplication is not that good (it is on extended play)
But for the price these tapes present a lot of material , that although doesn't get too in depth, presents a broad picture of some ""occult"" influences on the history of this era.
some interesting footage includes views of Wewelsburg castle, including the inside and out; views of Exersteine, where von Liebenfels had his castle, and some old archival footage of some Tibetan monks dancing.
although the information won't be anything new if a person has read Goodrich-Clarke, the packaging and fact that there is not much out there about this sort of stuff makes this worthwhile.",998438400,,705,4.883333333333334
1004270,1,6305247714,"The information presented in these films is interesting and useful to anyone who wishes to understand the cultural underpinings of Nazism.  But if you buy the set, be sure to save both the shipping list and mailing label.  I found the technical quality of my copies so poor I could not watch them all.  This was due to a defective product.  Unfortunately, it was some days before I discovered this and by then the packing material had been tossed out.",994118400,6,451,4.6
1004271,2,6305247714,The concept of this video is interesting to say the least. Himmler's attraction to the occult and mystic ceremonies  explains alot about the various rituals that were conducted  by the Nazis during the Third Reich. But the very poor quality  of the archival footage and audio tends to take away from the overall story line..,987984000,3,324,4.8545454545454545
1004272,3,6305247714,"I got this as a gift. What the heck?  Somewhat interesting, but also quite goofy.  I'm amazed that someone made this, and even more amazed that someone bought it!  It does have a niche market, I assume, and probably is quite good to those who favor Nazi Occult mythology.
I only wish they had a section on Nazi UFO/Spaceship technology.  They went to the moon in '44, you know.  Really!",978566400,5,386,4.457142857142857
7886692,1,6305247714,"Some people may find this documentary dry, because it contains historical footage with a narration, rather than ""re-enactments"" and five second cuts from scene to scene, which distract from the topic. I found the subject fascinating and enjoyed watching the FOUR films. I saw these films elsewhere and attempted to buy them on Amazon. I gave this listing 1 star, because the version is incomplete. SEE WARNING NOTE BELOW.

This version is incomplete. The Occult History of the Third Reich, has 4 parts. This version only has 3 parts: The Enigma of the Swastika, The SS Blood & Soil, & Adolf Hitler. For some unknown reason, it does NOT contain Himmler the Mystic.

If you want all 4 parts, purchase the following version:

This version has 3 DVD's, but there is no reason they could not put 4 parts on 3 DVD's. The product description is not very complete, so I got confused and bought this version. Since it is not the reseller's fault, I can't return it, so now I have to buy the correct version, too.

So, why doesn't this version contain Himmler the Mystic? Does anybody know?",1525478400,,1315,5.364077669902913

The true amateur of sensational and strange stories can still be fully satisfied with Himmler's Witch Project, or the Hollow Earth Theory.

In many aspects, the Nazi era was like a breach in space and time. What happened during these almost 12 years of dictatorship, at the heart of Europe, in one of the most civilized and industrially advanced country, does not match the moral, philosophical and religious values that existed everywhere else at the same time in the world. There is therefore a need to revisit all historical proven facts linked to Nazi oddities that one rarely finds in mainstream historians' books.
This book is great value (like another good one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nazi-Secrets/dp/B00CKZGETY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nazi Secrets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Occult-Roots-of-Nazism-Secret-Aryan-Cults-and-Their-Influence-on-Nazi-Ideology/dp/0814730604/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology</a>&nbsp;on Amazon.com) and generally (but not always) aims at separating these facts, but too often it words differently old stories found on the Internet.",1378598400,,1447,6.864130434782608
