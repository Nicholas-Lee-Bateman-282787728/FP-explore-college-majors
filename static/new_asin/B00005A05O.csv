1410239,3,B00005A05O,"'Nowhere to hide' is the most visually original film I have seen in years.  going way beyond the Oriental action movie pyrotechnics that have shaped Hollywood imitations since 'the Matrix', director Lee Myung-se tirelessly creates something startlingly different in each scene, each frame even.  The scene that triggers the main narrative, for instance, the murder of a drug baron, is filmed as an extraordinary cinematic poem, using Eisenstein's Odessa Steps sequence from 'Battleship Potemkin', completely draining of it its kinetic energy, as the rain falls slowly, a mournful Bee Gees cover over the soundtrack, the action choreographed in slow-motion fragments, the actual act less a brutal crime than the culmination of a dance in colour and movement.  this destabilising of the action occurs throughout - slow motion so slow it becomes a photo-story; definition so pixelated it becomes animation; editing so fractured it becomes abstract.  When Lee isn't making the crime narrative unexpectedly beautiful - one roof-top, laundry-lined, nocturnal fist-fight is turned into a flickering shadow-show; a Kitano-like sequence of rare calm priveleges a snowball-fight between two detective friends as they wait and wait - he is making it comic: the influence of Sergio Leone and his imitators loom large in the exagerrated, implausible and bathetic treatment of violence.
The problem with so much restless originality is that the plot gets somewhat lost, the genre becomes destabilised too effectively.  the hero, the archly-named Detective Woo, is the kind of gleefully fascistic cop who makes Harry Callahan and Aldrich's Mike Hammer look bureaucratic, wielding baseball bats with aplomb, torturing suspects by hanging them from their feet off rails.  There are a few cliched attempts to give 'depth' to this lunatic, by suggesting his alienation from his family, or the poignancy of his friendship with his sidekick.  what actually happens is that Woo's authority is undermined not by his psychosis, but that his power is only assured when backed by a group of gangster-like heavies; on his own he is notably inept, no match for the silent, charismatic, deadly Gian Maria Volonte-lookalike, whose elegant swiftness is much more appealing.  'Nowhere' is the kind of film you desperately want to love, but, because it doesn't really gel, you can't.",1004918400,5,2350,5.401639344262295
1410240,4,B00005A05O,"Very good movie, excellent use of filming techniques, soundtrack was a little bit off at times but still worth the watch, and one thing, it does ran like cats and dogs with sun shining in the background, visit korea sometime!",997747200,2,225,4.65
1410241,5,B00005A05O,"Every now and than comes a movie that just excites you from the opening credits to the ending credits. This Movie is one of them!
I remember seeing this movie at the video store and wonder: ""what the hell is this about?"" I put the dvd in the player, pressed start and the rest was magic! I loved it so much I watched it twice that day, and ordered it the next day.
If you are a big fan of film editing, this movie will amaze you! I have not been so excited from a movie by how it was cut! You have to see it for yourself, to see what I am talking about.
The story, plot, characters, sound, lighting, edit, and music are purely great! Myung-se Lee seems to be on the right road one day to be consider great among his peers, if he keeps up with this kind of direction for his movies.
As for now, I am becoming a great fan of his movies.. and cannot wait to see what he'll do next!",996883200,6,878,3.938202247191011
1410242,2,B00005A05O,"I saw this movie and thought everything was so absurd.  How could rain pour like cats and dogs and have sunlight in the background? (Last fight scene at the abadoned railway)  This movie is about a killer drug lord trying to get away from the cops.  The plot was dumb, the cinematography was less than average; however, the only nice thing I can say about this movie is it's soundtrack.  Pretty good stuff.

At his middle of directing career, he finally found something different which was mostly a visual touch. It is not like an American film, it had no good plots, but the raw feeling and erie images are working at their best. You will remember some scenes; they won't go away easily from your brain. All I can say is that you will see something new and unique, and that is why this movie deserves my rating. (Creativity) Five Stars. Don't miss it!",994982400,6,552,4.465346534653466
1410244,1,B00005A05O,"After watching just the first 10 minutes of this, I had a special effects induced headache from all the clearly unnecessary visual and sound editing. Obviously hoping that it would in some way make up for what is otherwise a mediocre crime movie, the director instead went for post-production appeal. Sadly, I cannot recommend it.",1375660800,,330,5.0181818181818185
1410245,3,B00005A05O,"This movie has a lot of action and good character development. The villain and the hero are played well and there is plenty of suspense.

1410246,4,B00005A05O,"Nowhere to Hide follows a group of cops hunting down a cold-blooded killer. However, the killer is an elusive master of disguise, proving to be harder to capture than originally expected. Nowhere to Hide is a great crime drama with a slick, distinct style.

The story in this film is fairly simple, yet it's not just another chase film. The style in this film creates an immersive atmosphere that effectively compliments the unique action sequences; this style is beatifully captured through the stunning cinematography and amazing editing. The ending of the film was amazing, and felt epic in away; I won't spoil the ending, but it really has a brilliantly captured ""final showdown"" vibe. Although I have been praising the style and editing of the film, the movie doesn't solely rely on its style nor does it feel pretentious or artsy; the movie simply uses the style to make its action and drama pop and feel unique.  I also enjoyed the music in this film, and the acting was great as well.

Overall, Nowhere to Hide is a dark, gritty crime drama with a unique style positively adds to the story. I recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Nowhere to Hide has strong violence and blood.",1359158400,,1212,4.729857819905213

1410250,2,B00005A05O,"Boy, are these cops stupid. Think: if the Keystone Cops weren't comedy. That's what these characters are like. They run roughshod over everyone not cuz they are concerned and trying to protect innocent people -- but cuz they don't know what they're doing!

The bad guy here seems more intelligent -- but thats just cuz he's calm and confident -- not cuz he does clever things.

The direction of his movie may be unexpected and stylish but, for me, it was ugly to look at and it didn't make up for the unethical blundering of the subhuman heroes of this movie.",1264291200,,559,4.524752475247524
1410251,1,B00005A05O,"Nowhere to Hide (Myung-se Lee, 1999)

A surprisingly large portion of the IMDB discussion board for this movie is full of people arguing over whether the Wachiwski Brothers ripped off pieces of this movie for various and sundry scenes in the Matrix trilogy. I'm not sure about any given scenes,  but it certainly seems to me that there is a kind of similarity in the two films by way of them both being piles of dung with unbearably stupid tissue-thin plots that exist for the sole purpose of stringing together uninteresting fight scenes. (But then, you can't fault these movies alone for that sort of thing, not by a longshot.) No, strike that, it's an insult to Nowhere to Hide, which is at least mildly amusing now and again. It's better than The Matrix, but I have to say, that's setting the bar pretty darned low. (In case you haven't figured it out yet, I loathe The Matrix.)

Woo (Joong-hoon Park) and Kim (Dong-Kun Jang) are detectives trying to track down a murderer. Yeah, that's pretty much the entire plot, the simplicity of which leads us to subplot beginnings that die after one scene (not that we care, given that none of these characters is ever developed), silly twists and turns, a whole lot of extraneous explanation, and, of course, lots and lots of fight scenes. Have to fill that time somehow. Aside from Woo having a few snappy one-liners (which is actually kind of out-of-character for him, since the script attempts to paint him as a delusional loser), there's absolutely nothing about this movie worth watching unless fight scenes alone make a movie watchable for you. One to avoid. *",1251331200,,1611,4.725978647686833
1410252,5,B00005A05O,"I really do not understand why this film has been getting such a varied response! It may be true that the story is nothing new BUT VISUALLY I would even consider this a work of art - something that I've rarely said about an action film since the original new wave of Hong Kong cinema hit these shores way back (and was in turn, co-opted by Hollywood). Black & white, freeze frame, slo-mo, every trick in the book is utilized by this talented director creating an giddy head-swirling, brain-twisting, ""what's next?"" effect throughout.
Key scenes: ""Holiday"" - the set-up for the film's plot bounces between B&W & over-saturated colour. The ""businessman"" (crime boss) murder & robbery takes place in the rain (as does many of the dramatic high points - in rain or snow) as the melancholy BeeGees' 1st album track plays (back when they were imitating Sgt. Pepper, prior to imitating KC & the Sunshine Band!). ""The Duel"" - the INCREDIBLE fight scene during a downpour (of course!) is the epic climax of the whole wild ride which is definitely one of the greatest bits of filmmaking I've seen in hundreds of films! In fact, never have I seen as exciting a movie fight with less than a dozen punches thrown - kind of the reverse mirror effect of a Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung/Yuen Biao style hyperactive stunt-fest. This very scene is where ""The Matrix"" comparison comes from - NOT THE PLOT but the visual style, for those above who seem confused about this point. I've watched this sequence dozens of times and it never fails to amaze! The cherry-bomb on top of this thrill cake.
I can only add the cool acting - especially our anti-hero ""thugs with badges"" who are armed with baseball bats and tear gas guns and have no moral reservations about beating handcuffed suspects for information and the lineup of bad guys - not only our main villain radiating cool in his sunglasses,  trenchcoat & machete, but guys named ""Fish Head"" & ""Meat Head"". I also add the startling music selections to the ""plus"" column & recommend this to anybody that appreciates Asian action cinema at its finest. I'm looking forward to more from this director and just wish there would have been a sequel!",1233532800,7,2168,4.705263157894737
1410253,4,B00005A05O,"First off, the posted run-time of 100 minutes means that this is the shortened version.  The true length should be 112 minutes.  I'd suggest tracking down a copy of the all-region Korean version if you want to see the uncut film.  I've not seen the shorter version, so my review will be of the 112-minute version.

I have to start out by asking ""Did I see the same movie as other people?"" Not because I disliked the movie, but because on the box and on this site and in other reviews I've seen the action compared to ""The Matrix"". I have to admit, I saw nothing even resembling that film here. No kung fu, no wires, no bullet time, no CG, no slick choreography. Other than the fact that some of the fight scenes are done quite artistically, there's nothing that is reminiscent of ""The Matrix"" here. That is not to say that it is a bad movie, quite the contrary. I just think it is unfair to put that tag on a movie. It'll only attract people that will be disappointed. Now, onward and upward.
This is a solid movie. It was recommended to me by a friend whose tastes I respect. And he didn't disappoint. The story can be described simply as two detectives track down a murderer. But, once you see the first main scene (which is quite violent) juxtaposed against the simple, sweet melody of the Bee Gee's ""Holiday"", you know you're in for something different.

What separates this film from the standard fare is that the characters have heart. They bring you fully into their world, no matter how simple or sad or angry. They have personality and dimension. Welcome doses of humor are found throughout that keep the film from sinking under a heavy weight that seems to hang over our main character.

And while the action is not ""The Matrix"", it is definitely a thing of its own. The fight sequences could be described as artistic, but not in any poetic way. The director uses camera tricks (frame rates and shutter angles), color, still frames, shadows, and various other tricks to show us action that would seem otherwise familiar. The artistic approach certainly doesn't take away from the sheer brutality of some of the violence. Don't let the pretty appearance fool you into thinking that the film somehow glosses over the bone-crunch factor. The director just shows it to you in a new way. In fact, he does this in many places throughout the film.

In one scene where the characters are staking out a nightclub, the director employs a technique that is genius and fitting, regardless of whether it was done to save on budget or not (which I'm not aware of). But, the same scene shot in a more standard fashion would seem out of place in the film.

Sure, we've all seen this story a million times. But the package it comes in is new and refreshing. Our main detective is the antithesis of the supercop. Lumbering and oafish, and possibly not the brightest bulb in the bunch, he still possesses a charm and street smarts that more than make up for it. The humor plays well. And by the end you really feel like you've got a grasp of who these characters are-and that makes a difference.",1218499200,7,3086,4.517921146953405
