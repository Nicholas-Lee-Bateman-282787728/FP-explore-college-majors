8060814,2,B0009HLCQA,"This was horrible, in fact the only thing that keep me from giving it 1 star was that I like some of the actors that were playing.  The MC looked like an ex-jock wearing a badly fitting tux.  The pretty girl (a former Miss something-or-other) was forced to wear corny outfits in order to illustrate a poker lesson, like folding laundry when they discussed folding a bad hand.  And was it just me or did the poker ""expert"" look and sound a lot like Jon Lovitz?  I prayed that they would just shut up so that I could watch the poker game, but they kept on reading off of the tele-prompter like someone in a bad high school video production.

Yes, this video was free with my Prime membership, but even at that price I paid too much.",1319241600,,730,4.260869565217392
8060815,1,B0009HLCQA,"Just terrible.  These guys have no business putting out this DVD.  Not much info, greasy (almost cartoonesque) characters, and poorly produced to boot.

If you're a beginner, look for the Vince Van Patton set.

The good review I saw here must be from their nephew Vinny.  Save your money on this one.",1195344000,3,300,4.6923076923076925
8060816,1,B0009HLCQA,"This is, by far, the worst Texas Hold'em video instruction I've ever watched. Only the basics are covered. It has NO entertainment value.

Please, save yourself some money and buy a book, preferably by Phil Gordon or someone who KNOWS the game.",1179360000,,244,4.809523809523809
8060817,5,B0009HLCQA,"This DVD set covers the basics on how to play Texas Hold Em.  It includes 2 Disks and a POCKET GUIDE that you can take with you to play.  It's the only DVD I've seen that teaches both Limit Hold Em and No Limit Hold Em.  I shared WiseGuys with a friend of mine who had never played poker before, and he got second place in a mini-tournament.  (Personally, I think he got lucky, but he sure knew what he was doing.)  I thought some of the visuals were helpful for learning poker terms.  Check it out.",1138924800,3,499,4.092783505154639
8060818,2,B0009HLCQA,"I REALLY wanted to watch this and learn from it, but it's hard since the hosts are so annoying and ugly. Couldn't they come up with more decent people? One of the guys talks too loud, the other guy who won a million dollars or whatever makes me want to throwup and burn my eyes. what's up with that lisp, ugh all their voices are annoying. No, I'm not a stuckup person. This dvd has HORRIBLE production. In the beginner's dvd, they don't even have a good explanation. Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it. HAH. HIRE BETTER LOOKING, LESS ANNOYING PEOPLE. The black girl seems like she's trying too hard, she's (...), Iwanttopunchhertheend. UGHHH.",1128470400,3,672,4.608333333333333
