7271638,5,B00Z96KOB0,"This was amazing, best sports documentary ever in my opinion. I never knew the story of Anatoli Tarasov what an incredible inspirational figure he was re-inventing ice hockey and using a totally different approach to the game than the Canadians and Americans. Everyone my age or older remembers the 1980 game and getting the other side of the story is really something else.",1484265600,3,374,4.9523809523809526
7271639,5,B00Z96KOB0,"Fascinaring view from the Russian standpoint about our ""Miracle On Ice"" The documentary takes you back to the infancy of Russian Hockey and the innovations the originator of the Russian style of Hockey and subsequesnt differences.",1471996800,2,230,5.416666666666667
7271640,5,B00Z96KOB0,"I'm not a sports fan, but I watched this on a streaming service and loved it. My brother was a goalie who loved Jimmy Craig and I remember when Miracle with Kurt Russell came out. Loved that movie as well. What really drew me to this was a) I love documentary movies and b) I've never really heard anything from the former USSR's perspective. It was incredibly interesting to me (and my brother and dad!). The first half of this documentary focuses on the USSR training growing up all the way to the Olympics / Miracle on Ice game. The second half focuses on breaking away from Russia's team in order to play in the NHL and how it was viewed as betrayal. Being a hockey player in Russia is like being an A-List celebrity in the USA, so it was a feat for Fetisov to get to the NHL. I wasn't as interested in the latter part of the documentary initially, but after watching it again I enjoyed it. My brother and dad were very interested in the latter half as hockey fans. Definitely worth a watch!",1468713600,4,995,4.297872340425532
