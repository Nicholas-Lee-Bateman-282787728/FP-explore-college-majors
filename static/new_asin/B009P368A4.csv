Some hi-lites:
Close-ups of Chords,Scales and Licks.
Music Tabs on every exercise.
Two songs just available for you to practice on.
Really recommend to anyone that just wants to play around with their first guitar ,Or Those Old `Rock and Roll' farts who play the Dive Bars and need a refresher course,Please.",1370131200,,449,5.081081081081081
