2738295,5,B000MQ4WMY,Every generation would enjoy this series.  Ann is so beautiful to look at and Donald was the ideal boyfriend.  The series was funny without being dirty.  I highly recommend it as a gift for the 80's generation.,1189555200,6,210,4.621621621621622
2738296,5,B000MQ4WMY,"Being a child of the 60's, and an avid collector of vintage television programs from the 50's and 60's I was ever so delighted when Shout! decided to get on the good foot and release this series.  Back in the day, these programs had the best ensemble cast, storylines that didn't always have a popular resolution at the end of 22 minutes but great theme songs, openings and epilogues and some even presented the name of the particular episode.  Every season of this series is a treasure and this one (season 3) is no exception.  Carefully and beautifully packaged and sprinkled with extras, it makes me smile seeing Donald Hollinger, Mr. Marie and the rest of the regulars and semi-regulars and of course, who could ever forget Ann Marie's awesome wardrobe.  Perhaps one of the future extras will reveal how she managed to look so fashionably trendy on waitressing and other quirky jobs in NYC.  Now that I have seasons one, two, & three, let's go for the rest.  You go girl!",1189296000,14,975,4.6395348837209305
2738297,5,B000MQ4WMY,"Always loved this show! I'm so happy with the DVD releases.  I can hardly wait for Seasons 4 and 5!  If you loved ""That Girl"" then, you'll love these DVDs now.",1188950400,7,159,4.096774193548387
2738298,5,B000MQ4WMY,"I remember my parents watching THAT GIRL during its original run, and then watched it for several years myself on reruns.  It sounds cliche, but truly, THAT GIRL is as fresh today as it was some 40 (gulp!) years ago.  Why?  The series was beautifully produced with excellent production values; the writing is superb; and the characters are wonderfully realized by Marlo Thomas, Ted Bessell, Lew Parker and others.  In addition, some of the best character actors working in Hollywood at the time appear in many episodes.

Season Three finds the series in full bloom.  Season One set the stage, it grew during Season Two, and now the show has come into its own.  Terrific episodes here, esp. the one in which Ann takes a bit part on a ""Laugh-In""-style show (""Laugh-In"" was a huge TV hit at the time) in which she descends a staircase as a very glamorous woman, only to take a pie in the face.  Not a slapstick episode...just great stuff!

In this set, we once again have commentary by Marlo Thomas and producer Bill Persky, which is terrific, as well as a really interesting piece on how the show was produced week after week.

The shows look and sound great, and the set is beautifully packaged.  Pick yourself up a copy, and you'll be SO glad you did.

Can't wait to get to Season 5, in which the title theme's rarely-heard lyrics are sung (and by the same background singers who supplied ""The Partridge Family"" and ""Love, American Style"" sound).  Thank you, Shout Factory!",1186876800,22,1473,4.640926640926641
2738299,5,B000MQ4WMY,"When I was growing up, I used to watch Marlo Thomas in That Girl, and loved the show because she was rather a modern day version of Lucy at the time.  But what I really liked was nothing really got Ann Marie down, when she was determined, she got things done... even if they didn't quite work out the way she wanted it to.

Of course, she always had problems with Don and her father when making the odd decisions (like when Ann's agent suggested she change her name to a more suitable stage name), but somehow Ann always came through.

Sometimes Ann would get into fixes without even trying.  For instance, in ""Bad Day at Marvin Gardens,"" Ann's parents decide to go to the city to a baseball game and attend the theater with Ann and Don.  Regrettably an unexpected rainstorm washes out the afternoon game, so the four decide on playing a game of Monopoly.  When the competition ends up with just Don and Mr. Marie, the game heats up where Mr. Marie offers to buy Don's Marvin Gardens, but Don refuses.  Realizing it's just a game, Don decides to graciously give the property to Lou Marie.

Regrettably Lou views this as an absolute insult with him proclaiming: ""Nobody gives Lou Marie Marvin Gardens!"" As a result Don and Lou end up brooding over the entire matter up to when they go to the theater.  Naturally Ann and her mom, Helen, attempt to qualm the dispute.  But when Helen sides with Don, Lou angrily gets a separate room at their hotel.

And you thought the Ricardos and the Mertzes had problems!

But I do give kudos to Shout! Factory for keeping the original uncut versions of the episodes intact.  Because when I watched them syndicated [even on Nick at Nite, C Channel (now Comedy Central), and TV Land], I never knew networks cut out scenes for time constraints.  Here I get to see the episodes intact and jog my memory of how some of the episodes originally went vs. my addled brain (I was about four when I watched the reruns and some of the episodes on ABC).

Personally I wish Shout! Factory could make a deal with Ms. Thomas and Rankin Bass to include the Saturday ABC Movie Special, ""That Girl in Wonderland,"" where Ann works for a children's book publisher, and envisions herself as the classic stars of famous storybook characters.

Especially since the First Season's hidden nugget had the original That Girl pilot [where Bessel played as Thomas' agent, and later inspired Episode #11 'What's in the Name?'], while the Second Season's gem had Marlo's never-aired pilot, ""Two's Company.""  I think would be great if they used that with either this Season or an upcoming Season.

Anyway, this series is definitely a must for anyone who fondly remembers That Girl, or is a fan of classic television.  I definitely recommend That Girl for everyone's TV Land DVD collection.",1186358400,10,2791,4.62474645030426

2738327,5,B000MQ4WMY,"As a huge fan and owner of classic tv series, I think this tv series is so cute and wonderful to watch!  I would say that women would enjoy it more than men, but even my husband got tickled at a few lines he would walk in on.  The show is so refreshing.  ""Anne"" and the other characters are fervent in their patriotism, respect for others, love, doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do, work ethic - values that seem to be deteriorating today.  The cast and sets are GREAT; the story lines are cute and funny.  I LOVE seeing Anne's now-vintage clothes and jewelry!  The sound, picture quality and packaging are GREAT.  I own all 5 seasons, watched the whole series twice and can assure you that at some point, I'll watch the whole series again.  It's truly a 5-Star purchase.  And BTW - since you have to buy each season separately, I'll post this same review for all five.  They're all worth it!",1395187200,2,918,4.347058823529411
2738328,3,B000MQ4WMY,"I like this show--especially the concept and the theme song during the 5th season.

that said, the show's plots are sometimes boring or so ridiculous, they are not believable in a way that is insulting to viewer intelligence. when the show is good--it is pretty darn good but i'd say that is 1/3 to 1/2 of the episodes. the third season is especially prone to these problems (so is season 2 and 4). season 1 has some pretty decent episodes especially early on. season 5 is more fast paced but especially in the middle/latter part of the series, did terrible jobs with social justice issues. the final episode where ann takes Donald to a women's lib is a real disappointment. ann should have gotten a big part in a broadway show and/or should have gotten married to Donald.

while I love marlo, someone should remake this show for the 21st century; it would be fun if done right.",1393977600,,878,4.550632911392405

She demonstrated all of the qualities which my parents were instilling in me as I grew up (not sure I am as successful as Ann Marie is!).  I had to get the rest of the seasons, if not just to see what she was wearing.  A great set for any young girl...(or any old broad who wants to step back in time).",1389052800,,479,4.118279569892473

2738334,4,B000MQ4WMY,"That Girl Season Three is a solid season. There's plenty of good episodes and some not so good ones. This DVD set does not have as many extras as the seasons one and two boxed sets. In one episode, Ann Marie plans on voting for the first time. In another episode, an African-American boy pretends that Ann is his mother. In another episode, a restaurant owner tries to earn Ann's love through free meals. There's still plenty of chemistry between Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell. Ted Bessell dreamed of directing a That Girl movie, but the project fell apart. Also, Bessell died in the mid-1990's. The production values on That Girl were high in the 1960's. The cast and crew used sets and locations. They used filmstock instead of video. Each episode had quality music. It was hard to find reruns of That Girl in the 1980's and 1990's. There were cable channels that had exclusive broadcast rights for episodes. I didn't watch That Girl reruns until I was 26 years of age! These days, Hollywood is driven by nostalgia and brand name recognition. They should produce a reboot of That Girl for TV or a That Girl feature film. By season four or five of That Girl, Marlo Thomas was losing interest in the show. She acted in the downbeat drama Jenny(1970). Thomas played Ann Marie in some animated That Girl TV special that aired on 1970's television.

The first three seasons were just charming...It reminded me of my oldest sister getting her first apartment, about the same time as Ann Marie. It really was like seeing a girl transition into a woman and all that that entails.  By the time the fourth season came along, Ann had lost some of her innocence and charm, and the fifth season...I still haven't purchased it because by then, she became a Laugh-In, Hee-Haw-Honey girlie prop with Liza Minelli triple dipped bat eye-lashes, on eyes that seemed to express cheesy rather than wonderment.  I'm still debating about purchasing that last season...I want to complete my set, but I really don't want to watch it...and if I should happen to, thank God you can always start over from the beginning.",1355356800,,863,4.671052631578948

She was in on the beginning of the women's movement and also was a silent producer, director and writer, just like Donna Reed was.  Marlo had control, but because of the 60's and the repression of women's rights not yet realized, she just remained the star of the show in the public's eye.

2738350,4,B000MQ4WMY,Season 3 of That Girl is no disappointment. The commentary tracks are on par with season one and two.  It would be interesting if Ms. Thomas were able to see the shows before commentary as there is a great deal of silent time where you can tell she is just watching and enjoying the show.  The quality is great and a joy to own.  Can't wait for seasons 4 and 5!,1190851200,8,361,4.056338028169014
2738351,5,B000MQ4WMY,"I ordered That Girl Season Three for my daughter who is an attorney and never has been one to break anything.  The first time she watched the second DVD in the package it broke when she removed it from the player.  Please advise me on what I should do next.  This is the first of the DVDs that I have ordered for her that has caused a problem for us.  I do not want this posted, but it was the only way that I knew to get in touch with you.  Thank you.",1190246400,2,452,3.817204301075269
2738352,5,B000MQ4WMY,Another Great Release of That Girl from Shout Factory I realize sales for a show like this aren't the same as say Grey's Anatomy etc... but this is classic television and I commend Shout and Marlo Thomas and company to keep releasing this classic tv series. Other companies like FOX have stopped releasing shows like Mary Tyler Moore and The Bob Newhart show becuase they feel they aren't selling well even though the fans have stuck it out waiting for further season set releases. I hope we see the rest of this series released on DVD in a timely manor as it has been released so far.,1190160000,8,585,4.4766355140186915

8170547,5,B000MQ4WMY,"I am writing the same review for Seasons One, Two and Three. If you are considering purchasing Season 3 of That Girl, I'll presume you're already familiar with this wonderfully entertaining sitcom. If you haven't purchased Seasons One and Two, stop now and purchase them. For those of us who know the series, Season Three will not disappoint. Ann (Marlo Thomas) is still delightfully kooky. Donald (Ted Bessell)--the best boyfriend EVER--is still funny, smart, handsome, warm, tender, affectionate, compassionate. No wonder I loved this show as a teenager. Even now as a mature woman, I firmly believe this show should be required viewing for every man who wants to learn how to really love a woman. Buy it. Delight in it.",1499299200,2,722,4.975206611570248
