He is very insightful and teaches the fundamentals of head drawing, something I always struggled with for a long time. After watching all his dvds I can honestly say my technique vastly improved.",1356134400,,372,4.485294117647059
8131100,3,B000GETV5U,"I've watched quite a number of these Gnomon videos and I would say they could benefit from some editing and planning beforehand.  It appears they just turn on the camera and let the person teaching do whatever he or she does for a couple of hours.  They rarely seem to be well structured or planned out.

With that said I've got to of the Bob Kato dvd's and they are some of the better Gnomon titles I have seen.  Kato certainly has some excellent ideas about drawing the head and drawing in general to present.  I think just about anybody from beginner to advanced could benefit from his dvd's.

If you sit through these a few times and implement the concepts your head drawing skills will improve.",1249171200,,699,4.464566929133858
