1220850,5,B00000ICEZ,"Had the video now for about a month. Kids favorite. They read along with the book. Ask for it every day. Interaction with the kids tops. Songs are catchy and the kids know all the words by now. They act out each scene in the video. My kids have seen this movie just about every day this month, and still ask for it. If you're going to show only one video a day, this is the one.",996364800,2,378,3.9220779220779223
1220851,5,B00000ICEZ,"We actually borrowed this video from the library prior to purchasing.  What a great video!  My daughter loves it and consistently requests it.  The songs and kids are fantastic.  My daughter loves each of the kids and practices the ""dance"" moves while singing the easy to recall words.  There was many a night when I awoke to the tune of ""Bluey the Blue, Blue Blanket"" ringing in my own head. All kidding aside, the kids are especially charming because they appear to be average kids.  I highly recommend this video to any and all parents of young kids.",995846400,3,553,4.591836734693878
7910091,4,B00000ICEZ,"Using my Gramp`s account. I used to watch this VHS when I was a baby. Great entertainment for babies and toddlers. After awhile, I kinda got bored with this tape and I stopped watching it. I have read other reviews that say it can get annoying after watching it a million times.",1416873600,,278,4.365384615384615
7910092,5,B00000ICEZ,This video (and I do wish they would redo in a DVD) is a total favorite with my almost one year old GD and was a similar favorite of her big sister.  It can get a bit boring for the adults but the little ones find it fascinating and dance and sing along with it over and over again (which the adults might find a bit boring).  It will be boring for older children but is so fascinating for the little ones.,1224633600,,406,3.9390243902439024
7910093,3,B00000ICEZ,"Makes me want to hit my head against a wall, but my kid seems to love it, June 3, 2008
By  k tha kool 1 (Beantown) - See all my reviews

I'll be the first to admit that this video is truly heinous. The acting, production value, and songs are atrocious. However, as much as I hate it, everyday when my daughter wakes up or when she gets home from daycare, she asks for ""more bunny!"" And as I sit here typing this, I have one of the songs from this video stuck in my head....making...me...crazy.... My daughter could watch this thing repeatedly for hours, so for that, I have given it 3 stars. It will definitely occupy a kid for 30 minutes when you need to get the dishes done. We got our copy at thrift store for $1. I wouldn't recommend spending any more than that.",1212451200,,766,4.168918918918919
7910094,4,B00000ICEZ,"I agree with many of the previous posts that this video borders on ridiculous. The songs are not the least bit creative (Blue-y the blue blue blanket??? Come on!!) and the whole thing looks pretty unprofessional.  BUT, it is the ONLY video my active 16-month-old son will sit and watch. He loved the book before he saw the video, so seeing Paul and Judy and all the familiar pictures in the video was really fun for him. Plus, he loves to dance to the songs!  I guess it's like ""Teletubbies"" and ""Barney""--parents just don't understand.",1184025600,,536,4.631578947368421
7910095,4,B00000ICEZ,I got this for my granddaughter 4 years ago and am now using it with my 13 month old grandson.  They both love it.  It has catchy songs and cute visuals. I recommend it!,1150502400,,169,3.9411764705882355
7910096,1,B00000ICEZ,"This video is just awful.  Although my 21 month old daughter loves it, it is the most annoying thing I've ever seen or heard. The lyrics to the songs make no sense at all and just ramble on. The kids in the video don't know what they're doing-it doesn't look rehearsed at all. I was expecting an animated version of the book, not random, unrelated, poorly written songs with kids wandering aimlessly around an ugly set. Don't waste your money on it.",1141948800,,449,4.475609756097561
7910097,1,B00000ICEZ,"I just spent $2.99 at Toys R Us, and I regret even spending that!  This is so poorly produced.  The songs are boring.  The kids are of the worst 'child actors' I've seen on a video.  Half of them look bored and mad while attempting to sing along with the songs.  This is just sad.  I'm trashing it.  I don't want to subject my kids to such bad acting and boring songs.  I want them to know music is fun and have them inspired.  I fear this video will zap them all of their creative juices.  I'd rather spend three times the money on a Barney video.  At least those are well produced with lively kids and catchy songs.",1135641600,,617,4.100840336134453
7910098,5,B00000ICEZ,"My 16 month old daughter LOVES this video and asks for it by name (Bunny? Bunny? Bunny? Bunny?).  It's the only video where she'll sit and watch the whole thing straight through.  The songs are catchy and although the kids don't quite know all the words or the steps, it's still endearing.  It makes them a little more real.  She also loves the clips of the children and giggles every time they show the baby laughing during the first song.  Great video - highly recommended!",1036281600,7,475,4.541176470588235
7910099,4,B00000ICEZ,"This fun companion to the ""Pat the Bunny"" group really gets my three-year-old dancing and singing!  The music is very catchy and upbeat (there are a couple of slower numbers to give the kids a rest), and it is themed after the pages in the book.  Some people may appreciate the fact that the kids performing in the video are not professionals, but dance just like any kid moving to fun music.  Interspersed throughout each song is also footage of kids participating in the activities the song talks about, which is especially appealing to me.  The only thing I didn't like as well is that a lot of the music sounds very similar--it could get boring, but my daughter hasn't seemed to care.  It also has the same drums in every song, and some of the music tends to be ""pop-y"".  Otherwise, I think it's a fun choice to get your kids moving, instead of staring blankly at the screen!  I especially recommend it for those who are ""Pat the Bunny"" fans.",1007769600,,946,4.465116279069767
