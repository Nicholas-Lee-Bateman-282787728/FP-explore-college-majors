5451395,4,B00AMQGF60,"I enjoyed of these films as I am a big fan of this type of western. I just wanted to say Gods Gun is not Amaphoric, I detest films in WINDOW BOX so if you are looking for widescreen enhanced,  The Mercenary is the other is not.

5451396,3,B00AMQGF60,"Let me start by saying The Mercenary is one of my all time favorite movies, certainly my favorite Nero movie. The movie has been somewhat remastered, more so than my other copy. This would have got a much higher rating if the DVDs weren't clearly burned discs with a telltale violet read surface. The labels are painted, but burns have a short lifespan. This movie deserves a R1 blu-ray release or at least a proper DVD release. To remaster such a great movie and release it in this fashion is just a shame. (Gods Gun is pretty mediocre but I assume 95% of people who order this are well versed in these matters)",1392336000,8,612,4.424778761061947
5451397,5,B00AMQGF60,The mercenary is an awesome movie particularly  that very hot actress Giovanna ralli she is smoking hot can't take my all eyes off her when she's onscreen. Franco Nero is better here than he was a django. Tony musante and jack parlance are great in this film too.,1385510400,,263,4.479166666666667
5451398,4,B00AMQGF60,"I have been a fan of spaghetti westerns ever since seeing the 'man with no name' trilogy.  Apart from the rugged anti-heroes portrayed the Morricone soundtrack made the experience both alive and moving.  It would seem that Leone and Corbucci broke the mould which spawned way too many poor imitations, including some of the forgettable Hollywood attempts.

In The Mercenary we have Jack Palance play a homosexual (or at least that is what seems to be inferred) mercenary siding with the Mexican Government, while Franco Nero (with blond hair and looking uncannily like Terrence Hill) playing a Polish mercenary siding with Tony Musante portraying a Mexican bandit morphing into a revolutionary.  Nothing too deep in this movie, but a treasure just the same and an excellent quality transfer to the DVD format.  The haunting Morricone soundtrack greatly adds to the positive experience for me.  I have yet to watch God's Gun, but I am sure Lee Van Cleef will not disappoint.",1369440000,,973,5.012422360248447
5451399,4,B00AMQGF60,"""The Mercenary"" is one of the best spaghetti westerns, which doesn't necessarily sound like much of a compliment, but it is. In fact, it is one of the best Euro-westerns ever made, those who like the Eastwood-Leone ""dollars"" trilogy or the original ""Django"" will enjoy this one as well. In fact it reteams star Franco Nero and his ""Django"" director auteur Sergio Corbuchi, perhaps the most underrated western director of them all, coming fresh off his masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Silence/dp/B00012L77W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Silence</a>, this is about as good as most anything else he did. Also starring the legendary Jack Palance (as ""Curly"", a name that will seem familiar to fans of his Oscar winning role in ""City Slickers""). This ""amazon.com exclusive"" DVD looks great, and is worth the purchase.

Also included is the more dismissive spaghetti western knock-off ""God's Gun"" starring Lee Van Cleef, Richard Boone and once again Palance, in fact to make this set more interesting it could have been called A Jack Palance Western Double Feature. The stars are the movie's only saving grace, and they even come off bad forced to utter intolerable wooden dialogue that makes their performances appear stiff. Available in many budget public dominion copies and sets, ""God's Gun"" has never looked better than it does here, too bad it just aint worth looking at at all.

5451400,4,B00AMQGF60,"Judging by the cheap cover design and double feature aspect common among Spaghettis these days I expected the quality on this DVD set to be poor. I was surprised to find an excellent transfer, complete, uncut and widescreen!
Even better, it's actually a two disc set so both films aren't crowded onto one disc. THE MERCENARY is the first of Sergio Corbucci's Mexican Revoltion Trilogy that continued with COMPANEROS and WHAT AM I DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF A REVOLUTION (saddly laking a Region One DVD release). If you enjoy the somewhat better known Companeros with Franco Nero and Tomas Milian you will be sure to enjoy The Mercenary. It too stars Franco Nero as a foreign gun for hire in Mexico during the Revolution, however, he does not play the same character ""the Swede"" as seen in Companeros but here plays ""the Polak"", though the two characters are basically the same.
I expected to miss Tomas Milian in the bandit role this time around but was pleasantly surprised by Tony Musante's performance as the Revolutionary Bandit frenemy of Nero's. Jack Palance plays the villain in this film too like he did in Companeros but is a different character named ""Curly"" and I don't mean the one from City Slickers.
The Mercenary wasn't as humorous as Companeros and oddly prolific Spaghetti Author Howard Hughes thinks The Mercenary is the better film, though I prefer Companeros myself.
I'm not going to say much about God's Gun because its an easy film to find on just about any of those Spaghetti Western 20 Packs. If you're a fan of that film I will at least say the picture quality is much better than in other versions and its in widescreen.
In summary the quality of both DVDs is spectacular!",1357948800,20,1694,4.707070707070707
8553907,5,B00AMQGF60,"""The Mercenary"" is as good as Spaghetti westerns get that aren't directed by Sergio Leone.  Great action, music, and style.  Franco Nero plays his typical type role and Tony Musante is great, one of his better parts.  Transfer and picture quality is fine and the price is right.  The only complaint I have is on the cover they show a picture of Warren Oates from the movie ""Barquero"" instead of a shot from ""The Mercenary"".  ""God's Gun"" on the other hand is as bad as a foreign (made in Israel) western can get, I can't even recommend watching it.  I love Lee Van Cleef but this is a stinker of a stinker, right up there with ""Captain Apache"" (same awful wig as well).  Buy this for ""The Mercenary""",1506470400,,698,4.40625

8553909,5,B00AMQGF60,"Unbelievably great value here on manufactured-on-demand DVD-Rs (2 total - 1 for each film) of excellent quality with nary a glitch to be witnessed.

""God's Gun"" as any self-respecting Spaghetti Western fan knows, has made the rounds in poor quality prints for years. Did we complain? A little, but it was such an excellent movie that it was more like a grumble.

HOWEVER on this ""Amazon Exclusive"" set we now have a PRISTINE PRINT that will probably be sent up in one of those time capsules for future (or, ulp, current) space creatures to find and enjoy (don't forget to include a bag of potato chips of maybe even a frozen pizza or two).

Widescreen? Yes, widescreen, very W-I-D-E, so you can get your Lee Van Cleef on BIG TIME. Not only in the widescreen sense, but also because he plays 2 (TWO), yes 2 whole roles here, you've never seen anything like it.

""The Mercenary"" was all new to me, but not only was this ALSO A PRISTINE/WIDESCREEN print, but a SERGIO CORBUCCI film !!! Franco Nero is in it !!! Jack Palance is in it !!! A buncha other people are in it, but you'll have to watch it to find out (you'll never get it outta me).

I was wary of the 'political' angle of this film, but, man, it is so nuts and over the top you'll wish all politics were this entertaining. There's even a religious angle, too, that has to be seen to be believed.

Don't miss 'em.",1505865600,,1369,4.3700787401574805
8553910,5,B00AMQGF60,"The Mercenary is a cult-classic ""Spaghetti Western"" that doesn't disappoint on any level.  It possibly has the most action packed scenes crammed into one western movie of all time, except for the definitive classic ""The Wild Bunch""  This film, like the Wild Bunch takes place during Mexico's revolution of 1911, and like so many other fine films of this particular genre, there's shoot-outs a-plenty, and great characters.  I first saw then when I was a kid on TV and jumped at the chance to own it on DVD.  If you like this Revolutionary Western genre, then I recommend buying The Mercenary, along with The Wild Bunch, A Fistful of Dynamite, The Professionals, and Bandito.  If you can ever find a copy of the ""Treasure of Pancho Villa"", that's a keeper too!  And don't forget ""Big Jake"".  (not really a revolution western, but it is set in the same basic turn-of-the-century era, and who can pass up ""The Duke""?",1503532800,,913,4.7405063291139244
8553911,5,B00AMQGF60,Excellent transfer from the original film. It is a beautiful print. Just loved it. Only drawback the soundtrack is in mono (like the original) so can't complain.,1484784000,,161,5.0
8553912,5,B00AMQGF60,"Excellent DVD quality. The western ""The Mercenary""  is a top class western.",1464825600,,75,5.25
8553913,4,B00AMQGF60,"Purchased this combo pack for ""The Mercenary.""  Was not disappointed. Quality print and the added footage was a real treat. The packaging is a little misleading in that the picture for ""Mercenary""  is actually Warren Oates from ""Barquero.""... a movie that also starred Lee Van Cleef,... who stars in ""God's Gun.""
""Mercenary"" is more of a Lasagna Western because of all of the layers in the story. Told partially in flashback,  the interplay between Paco Roman and ""The Pollack""  is a lot like Tuco and Blonde in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""  or  the Swede and Vasco in ""Compan~eros."" Jack Palance is menacing as Curly. The duel in the bull ring resembles Sergio Leone's climax in ""G.B.U."" with Ennio Moricone's  music swelling to the end.
""God's Gun."" is basic Spaghetti fare. But, as Primus would agree,... anything with Lee Van Cleef in it is worth a look.",1462147200,2,863,4.751677852348993
