I'm looking forward to getting more episodes.  These are like treasures in the attic.  Thanks for making them available.",1434844800,,270,4.702127659574468
8181854,4,B000NVL7OE,"Pros

  1) This is the only way to get the product
  2) I enjoy the show

Mehs

  1) The video is acceptable (at best - truly sub-mediocre video quality)
  2) It comes on a DVD-R (not a long lifespan compared to a DVD-ROM)

Cons

  1) The price is offensive to all the fans of the show.

The disk didn't have anything on it/ refused to play.",1379894400,2,114,4.476190476190476
8181856,1,B000NVL7OE,"This is one of the best recent examples of revisionist history. To my clear recollection, Season 1 featured Stacy London and the colorful Wayne Scot Lucas. These early episode were creative and very entertaining. For unclear reasons, Wayne was unceremoniously booted from the series after the inaugural season to be replaced by Clinton Kelly. Nothing against Mr. Kelly, but the series became greatly diminished for the personnel change. TLC should have the honesty to call this collection what it really is - Season 2. Let the buyer beware. If you are looking for Season 1, this is NOT it!",1290038400,10,589,4.959595959595959
8181857,1,B000NVL7OE,"Since I loved the BBC America Version of What Not to Wear (with Trinny and Susannah)I thought the American version would be just as charming, helpful, and gently chiding. Not so! Rather than the genuinely helpful and entertaining advice given by Trinny and Susannah, our American version is sniggering, condescending, and out to ""entertain"" us by embarrassing those whom it purports to help. To be sure, the English version also had the style counselors throwing up their hands in despair at the frumpy dress of their constituents, but then they put their hands down and set out to gently and firmly raise the confidence of ""ordinary"" women and men, regarding dress. Our American version simply bashes the taste and lives of the makeovers, and the hosts all seem to have developed their fashion sense from the tabloids.",1197244800,10,819,4.985401459854015
