7928678,5,B0000507PM,"I bought this for my mother-in-law so she could practice yoga when it was convenient for her schedule.  She reports that she loves it!  She said her mobility and flexibility have improved, the instructions are delivered clearly and neither too fast nor too slow, and Lilias is very encouraging and informative.  My mother-in-law is a beginner (I got the tape for her after she had attended only 1 ""live"" yoga class) and she said it was perfect for her.",1037750400,21,452,4.69620253164557

I purchased this video a while ago and I have since begun to use it. Yes!!! Lilias talks but thank god she is taking time to explain in full what your body should fell like. I have one other video by her but I hope to purchase more in the future. Her teaching style is for everybody....",1031184000,19,350,4.014285714285714
7928680,4,B0000507PM,"I'm not certain about the rest of you out there, but I decide I will go to Yoga class, get psyched about it, begin the class and instatly get discouraged from feeling a bit behind the eight ball.  I know the class says beginner yet, I seem to be the only one in the room that doesn't know what a sitting duck or solar monkey...(well, you know what I mean) is.  The classes are not condusive to asking questions and I never seem to pick up on the moves due to the pace of the class.  Lilias' Total Body/New Yoga video was wonderful - she really does an excellent job of taking you through all the motions, breaking them down and giving you time to absorb without cooling off too much. In addition, I found that she made it seem simple enough for me and I rarely had to rewind the tape.  Don't get me wrong - the video leaves you feeling relaxed, but you do get a decent work out from it as well.  I have tried several other Yoga and Exercise videos and I find they try to pack too much into too little time.  Lilias seems to make all the exercises fit and doesn't rush it or let any one movement or stretch slip through the cracks. I highly suggest purchasing this video and will look for more from Lilias in the future!
Thanks Amazon!",980726400,91,1234,4.163865546218488
