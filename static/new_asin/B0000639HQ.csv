1688621,5,B0000639HQ,"My whole family saw this movie and we all loved it, so I never understood why it was a box office bomb! Maybee it's because everyone compared it to ""The Princess Diaries"" wich was in theaters 2 months before ""Max"". It perfectly portrays public middle school! It's Max's first day of Junior High School and has plans to make this year better than last. But upon arrival, he finds he is the target of the school bully, teachers are mean, and the girl of his dreams dosen't even know he's alive. But when his dad says they're moving, he seeks revenge on them all, including the evil ice cream man! His skeems to get back at everyone are hilarious! And it gets even better when he finds out he's not moving! There are even cameo's by the child rapper, Little Romeo, and pop sensation, Myra, who's hit ""Miracles Happen"" was featured in ""The Princess Diaries""! Your whole family will love it!",1014249600,4,886,4.509316770186335

1688696,5,B0000639HQ,"Having been in grade school a few years back, I remember the bullies and life as a short, thin kid: Max Keeble had my revenge!

""Max Keeble's Big Move"" enjoys the ingenuity of ""Home Alone"" for creating masterful pranks, though not as slap-stick. Not quite in the ""Ferris Bueller"" category, but appropriate for grade school kids.

The message delivered will please parents, and remind them of how hard being in school can be. When Max comes to grips with his mistakes, he takes responsibility. And he discovers that friendship is a great foundation for love.

You won't need Dolby Sound for this one. Be sure to invite a bunch of kids who will hoot and holler through the gags.

I fully recommend ""Max Keeble's Big Move.""

1688697,5,B0000639HQ,Daughter loves it because its funny and interesting. Its kind of like real middle school. Its about a boy who finds out he's going to move so he decides to become a legendary pranker before he has to leave. Then something unexpected happens.,1394323200,,241,4.627906976744186

1688702,1,B0000639HQ,"Here's another staggeringly unoriginal and unfunny kids comedy from Disney, where the future of the film is set up before the screenwriters type one word of it up: take a silly, clichd plot, with stereotype characters, put in all the clichs in the world into the script including an inevitable, shallow moral at the end, and sign on some child actors in the cast who kids today are familiar with. Throw in one or two possible adult comedians or rising child stars and you've got a sure moneymaker relying solely on parents taking their kids to see the fluff. Disney has used the formula for many decades, especially the nineties. It can be applied to almost any of their live-action family films, such as The Apple Dumpling Gang (Which was still somewhat enjoyable), First Kid, the awful The Pacifier, and others. The movies don't need to make lots of money, just enough profit to set them with a couple million more than their tiny budgets give them. That isn't hard.

  In Max Keeble's Big Move, the adults are the goat of almost every joke so it's hard to see them buying it for their kids. The billions of clichs in it make it nearly unwatchable for anyone with any sort of movie discretion at all.

  Max Keeble suffers from bullies who make typically lame taunts and stuff in school. He's picked on by the typically annoying and snobby principal (with typically abominable dialogue). He has a huge crush on the typically nasty popular girl who hangs out with the typically magnetic suck-up friends who would follow her through a tar pit. So when his typically retarded parents tell him he's moving, Max pulls all the typical pratfalls and pranks in these movies on the bullies in his school for a week, until he finds out the deepest plot twist you'll find here: he's not moving! Now he has to stand up to the bullies he played pranks on. And when he hangs out with the popular kids for a night his real friends abandon him, where another shallow moral makes its way into the film; something about ""not hanging out with people that don't dance and shake their booties on diner tables at night for fun.""

  Another scene finds the principal literally trying to kill young Max by locking him in his favorite pet shelter that's about to bulldozed. I was actually rooting for the principal, if only because for the first time in this movie something unexpected would happen. But nothing unexpected ever happens.

  I'm surprised the Golden Razzie Awards overlooked this movie when it came out. Max Keeble's Big Move is so stupid it gives these clichd kids movies a bad name.",1287446400,,2576,4.649779735682819

If you don't like movies that will blow you away with intense action, have you rolling on the floor with comedy, and bring you to tears with an amazingly written plot to rival those of Shakespeare, then by all means, avoid this movie. If you and your family want to enjoy the greatest cinematic experience ever created, click ""add to cart"", have it shipped overnight, and be prepared to be thoroughly enlightened by the epic performances of Alex Linz, Jamie Kennedy, and a younger but far more hilariously obese Josh Peck.

1688709,4,B0000639HQ,"This movie is about a kid who thinks he is moving to Chicago from ?So he decides to back at bullies,teachers,etc. Then it turns out he isn't moving!& that's all I can tell! Buy It!",1104537600,,180,4.171428571428572
1688710,4,B0000639HQ,"Imagine Meatloaf as he played Eddie in the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Remember? Now picture him having a son, or even worse a little 'Mini-me' clone. That who this kid 'Robe' reminds me of. He is a dark character who entertains his friends in the junkyard.

Ok anyway, this little squirt of a kid named Max Keeble is attending Junior High for the first time. He's got the bully (who writes his victim's name on his T-shirt everyday and shows an astonished and terrified crowd of students), overbearing history teacher, a beautiful science teacher, and a psycho loser for a principal.

So anyway imagine you have two days to do whatever you want with no consequences. That how Max sees life as he and his family are about to move. He takes his revenge on the principal with a squirrel and a monkey. Terrorizes the bully with what only can be described as a psycho Scottish frog with a Barney complex.

Of course he ends up not moving so he pays the price. Such is the moral of the story. It's a good movie for young teens and pre-teens. It has the squeaky clean Disney seal all over it so you don't have to worry about anything your kids will see. Even the sexy first chair clarinet player only goes so far, though she does have a Britney Spears type theme song whenever she appears on screen. Disney always has to have the fantasy princess and she's it.

Also this movie has a food fight that would have done The Delta House from 'Animal House' proud. A mustard bazooka made from a tuba was brilliant.",1102636800,,1501,4.447272727272727
1688731,2,B0000639HQ,".... You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure out what happens next.
A movie that is loud, clumsy, empty-headed, totally unfunny, mean-spirited & full of moronic supporting characters; MAX KEEBLE will appeal only to the most simple-minded of children. Amazingly there are FOUR writers credited here! Their combined creative genius even sees the biggest cliche of high school movies trotted out yet again: that of the cafeteria food fight!
Although it isn't a complete travesty, MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE is a film that belongs in the lower ranks of Disney productions. One that parents will be reluctant to suffer through with their kids. A shame considering it's directed by Tim Hill, whose previous film was MUPPETS FROM SPACE, which I consider to be THE best Muppet movie ever. You'd be better off watching that instead, or even one of the old classic Disney movies. (Especially if it's got Stella Stevens in it, in which case Dads will definitely want to watch it). Uncle Walt would not be impressed. Bring back Donald Duck!",1073606400,4,1030,4.8914285714285715
1688732,3,B0000639HQ,"Overall this was an entertaining movie; the story lagged a few times but was redeemed by moments of hilarity and action- the opening sequence is especially cool. Alex Linz single-handedly saves the movie with his suave but mischievous character; the supporting actors aren't too bad either (""Ice-Cream Man"" and the principal of Max's school stand out).
I would not recommend this movie for an older audience, neither a very young audience- preteens will probably love this flick, if my siblings are any indication. The filming, acting, and plot are hardly outstanding but are the norm for this genre of Disney movies.
The movie's message may convey a sense that it's okay to cause damage to property in the name of ""justice."" Discretion on the parent's part would be advisable. It's nothing extremely serious, much the same thing kids would see on Saturday mornings. It really depends on your family and what you view as acceptable.",1049068800,,932,5.019354838709678
1688733,5,B0000639HQ,"I wish Max Keeble was my father.  He repersents all that is good & just in the world, and is the point of my obsession.  However, the way they repersent the fat kid, I believe Robe was thy name, is perposturous and insulting towards my superior intelligence.  He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him.  I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties.  With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.
Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk?  IT WAS HER SEAT... The principal scared me a little bit, with his insane hi-jinks and all...The Saga Of Max Keeble makes me proud to be an American.  Wear the red, white, and blue proud Max.

1688734,5,B0000639HQ,"I have heard of movies get rated for language, humor, sexuality,  and nuity. But before this movie, I have never heard of a movie getting rated for some bullying. And that is one of the reasons why Max Keeble's Big Move got rated PG. The other is Crude Humor. It is about a boy starting junior high school. As the movie opens, Max Keeble (Alex D. Linz) is starting junior high school. And Max also delievers the papers when he is not in school. His Dad (Robert Carradine) sometimes has to wear customs to work. And the first time we see him in the movie, he wears a lobster custom. His best friends are Meagn (Zena Grey) and Robert (Josh Peck), but is nickname is Robe. But some bad news happens, first the near by animal shelter is being closed down, to make way from the junior high school's football stadium. The Princpal (Larry Miller) is closing down the shelter. His family has to move to Chicago. And also, the evil ice cream man (Jaime Kenndy) is after him. So Max decides to get revenge on the bullies. Including the student bullies, Troy McGinty (Noel Fishen) and Dobbs (Orlando Brown). McGinty hates McGoggles the frog, and wears shirts with the names of his victims. And Dobbs was once a millonaire, but has gone broke. And now steals the other students lucnch money, and even chargers to use the bathrooms. This is a great movie to watch with the family, even on a rainy night/afternoon/morning. If you love comedy movies, this is one you have to watch.

1688738,4,B0000639HQ,"I read alot of bad reveiws when this movie was just released but Im glad I diden't pay to much attention to them. I went and saw this movie with these little kids(7 and 9yr olds)I babysit. I wasent expecting much out of it considering it was aimed for the pre-teens. But as I was watching it I noticed how much I could relate to the charaters. I guess becuase it reminded me of Junior High that I left just 3 years ago. Max the short kid who wants his 7th grade year to be where he can finally be cool. His first day is a nightmare he gets,chased by the ""evil ice cream man"", beat up by Troy McGinty(my favorite character)a punk type bully who writes names of his victims on his shirt daily,Dobbs a 12year old stock broker steals Max's lunch money(I found one of the funniest charaters),and the wannabe superintentant principal keeps a grudge against Max becuase he distrupted the school assembly. When Max finds out he's moving Max plans to get back at all the people that pushed him and his friends around. I think all the actors did a belivable job-esspeacilly Alex D.Linz who plays Max. His acting did remind me of Fred Savage of the Wonder Years for some reason-his movements or his voice or somthing. But he is a great young actor. And it is a HUGE step up from that movie that should have never been made ""Home Alone 3"".This is not your adverage Disney movie(even if it is a little predictable)-In fact it reminded me a tad of that old Nickelodeon show Pete and Pete. I don't know who I would recomend this too. Im 17 and I love this movie to peices. I relized there is alot of comparison to the Princess Diaries and Max Keeble but there about differant things. Princess Diaries wasent as nearly as funny or entertaining as this. All and all I think you should let your pre-teens see this movie at least once.",1025568000,,1816,4.375739644970414
