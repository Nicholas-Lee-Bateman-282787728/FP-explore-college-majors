8278355,1,B001AOHPJE,This film could not run on a U.S. machine.  When I contacted the producer they said it is designed for European players not U.S.  Don't you think they would have advised us before the purchase.,1380844800,,193,4.485714285714286
8278356,4,B001AOHPJE,"This film was crested in the post World War II era, when the world was firstvencountering a rapid acceleration in technology.  Frontiers were being pushed back, and, people were pushing envelopes.
The idea is that aircraft manufacturers were trying to develop an aircraft that would reach or exceed Mach 1.
On the plus side, the film captures the postwar spirit of aggressive research to advance technology.  It fits perfectly the enthusiasm for development of the time.
One big problem of the time: there was something that was preventing aircraft from reaching and exceeding Mach 1 safely.  At the very beginning of the film, a pilot in a Spitfire reaches near sonic speed, and runs into buffeting (this is indirectly explained later in the film; in flight manuals of the time, the ""barrier"" was called ""compressability,"" and pilots were advised to throttle back).
The hero of the film comes up with an idea that would enable safe supersonic flight.  In the film, it works.  Unfortunately, in actuality, the ""solution"" is not sccurate, and would cause the death of the pilot who employed it.
One or two of the flying sequences include actions I doubt any sane pilot would attempt, even in the much less crowded skies of the time (e.g., diving an aircraft straight down into a widespread cloud bank is Not Good).
Despite its technical flaws, the film was so effective that many in the general public of the time believed that the first pilot to breask the sound barrier was British.
The film is an excellent dramas, but the aviation shouldn't be taken seriously.",1361491200,3,1563,4.8830188679245285
8278357,5,B001AOHPJE,"This is maybe the best science-fact (in the ANALOG SCIENCE FICTION sense) movie ever made. The Maltin movie guide gives it three and a half stars out of four, but it's five star for anybody who likes test-pilot adventure.

It won the Academy Award for Sound, so you can bet the noise when planes break the barrier (or break the planes) is perfect. There's also a weird science-fictiony musical theme associated with the barrier, a theme I've heard a million times in lots of movies, but which was apparently written especially for this one.

Who could ask for anything more? Keep a stiff upper lip and you'll look like a hero even at the bottom of a ten foot hole in the ground you just dug yourself into. You know how it is, boys: if you can't fly, you have to die.",1361318400,,766,4.387323943661972
8278358,2,B001AOHPJE,"I ordered this because it was on the USA web site and, as it said nothing about region or format, I expected it to be R1 and NTSC.

It is, in fact, R2 and PAL according to the case.

The film/DVD may be very good; I cannot say, because my R1 DVD Player will not play it. It refused, citing a Region conflict.

And, even if it did, my NTSC TV Set would not show it.",1356652800,,364,3.763157894736842
8278359,4,B001AOHPJE,"The DVD version of ""Breaking the sound barrier"" 1952, a David Lean production,  that I watched is disk one of ""The World War Collection"" May 27, 2008; this is funny as it has nothing to do with a war.

Originally produced by London Films. Copyright 1952 British Lion Film Corporation Ltd. at Shepperton. With the co-operation of the Ministry of Supply and the Director and Members of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors.

The film itself had Great Britain 1952 typed all over it. We get lots of footage of different 50's jets (The de Havilland COMET, The Vickers-Supermarine ATTACKER, the de Havilland VAMPIRE 113, and The Vickers-Supermarine SWIFT Rolls-Royce `Avon' Engine.)

 The basic Story and Screenplay by Terence Rattigan is of a father and owner of an aircraft industry. He wants to have the mysterious and unknown sound barrier broken. His excuse is ""because it is there."" It appears to his daughter that he is rather callous and will sacrifice the lives of his own son (Denholm Elliott who played Dr. Marcus Brody in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and son-in-law to accomplish his goal.  Will father and daughter come to terms or understanding of each other's world or will the daughter save her son from a similar fate in the insatiable clutches of her father.",1353110400,,1286,4.876146788990826
