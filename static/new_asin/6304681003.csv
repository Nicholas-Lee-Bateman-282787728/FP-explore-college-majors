918111,4,6304681003,"This film is a gem! A friend passed on the VHS to me knowing that I was looking for a copy, having opted against the DVD after reading the Amazon reviews. The entire cast is marvelous, in particular Art Linkletter as the perfect foil to Ronald Colman's acerbic smart-aleck. Everyone, however, pales a bit in comparison to Vincent Price who is almost unbelievably funny as the scheming CEO of a company that manufactures soap in addition to sponsoring a broadcast quiz show; his performance alone is reason enough to make this a keeper rather than a rental.
The sound on the VHS, BTW, isn't very good either at times, however, it's just in few spots; the picture is okay. If the DVD is no better than this, it might be worth picking up, but not at list.
Incidentally, Mr. Price possessed an unbelievable range--one has only to see him in the films in which he appeared prior to his becoming a horror icon (which isn't to be disparaged; those films are great fun) to know what I mean. In addition, he was an incredibly cultured man, kind and courteous, who was considered an authority on the finer things in life, such as art and food. I had the privilege of seeing him perform live in 1979 when he was touring in a revival of a one-man show called Diversions and Delights in which he played a post-Reading Gaol Oscar Wilde. The show ran in the tiny Roundabout Stage One theater on West 23rd Street here in Manhattan, our seats were practically onstage, and I can't honestly say that I've ever enjoyed an evening of theater more. Mr. Price was electrifying and to this day I can't watch his films without regretting that no one had the foresight to film a performance of Diversions and Delights. The world lost a great actor, a great connoisseur, and--most importantly--a great gentleman with his passing.",1104019200,28,1803,4.61993769470405
918112,4,6304681003,"I saw this on television over forty years ago and have always wanted to see it again. Trouble was that I had forgotten the title! Having discovered this a week or so ago I immediately ordered it (October 30th order, delivered in the UK on November 5th - well done Amazon).

It is as hilariouly funny as I remembered and I thoroughly recommend it. The sound track problem (mainly sibilant distortion) lasts only a few minutes and I did not find it too much a problem despite being a sound man by trade. I did find the film using the terms ""radio"" and ""television"" interchangeably a little confusing until I realised that in those early days of US TV, they simulcast television programmes, like quizes, on Radio.

I've always remembered it as a smart and funny film, especially notable for Celeste Holmes sophisticated turn as Ronald Coleman's charming nemesis and Vincent Price's off-the-wall performance as the eccentric manufacturor of ""Milady Soap, The Soap That Sanctifies.""
I looked forward to this DVD but must report that technically it falls too far short to recommend. About a quarter of the way into it, the sound turns extremely harsh and is almost unlistenable. Later still, intrusive scratches and smudges-- that surely could have been eliminated--suddenly intrude, spoiling the moment.

918114,5,6304681003,"Several years ago, I saw Vincent Price on a talk show, and he was asked what his favorite was of all the movies he had made.  He replied that it was a movie he considered ""way ahead of it's time"", titled ""Champagne For Caesar"".  I was very excited to hear him say that, because it has been one of my favorite movies since I discovered it late one night on a local tv station back in the 60's.
This is a very funny satire of quiz shows and of tv advertisers, backed by a stunning cast which includes Ronald Colman as Beauregard Bottomly, a genius who knows everything except how to keep a job.  He embarks on a quest to destroy a sponsor of a tv quiz show, by answering enough questions to bankrupt them.  Celeste Holme co-stars as the beautiful, intelligent femme fatale sent to find his weakness.  Vincent Price is the owner of the soap company who sponsors the quiz show, and his performance as the wickedly funny ""Dirty Waters"" is one of the many bright spots of this film.  Art Linkletter has a supporting role as ""Happy Hogan"", the host of the quiz show, with some very funny moments between him and Vincent Price.  Mel Blanc is the voice of ""Caesar"", an alcoholic parrot.  Everybody in this film is excellent, and this is a movie that shouldn't be missed.",1029024000,15,1261,4.405172413793103

The answer that he gives is said to be wrong-but then Einstien himself calls on the phone to verify the answer.  The reaction by Price is hilarious.  He missed his calling.

Ronald Colman and Celeste Holm, usually joyous in comedy, struggled here to make bricks without straw under the direction of Richard Whorf. The film is notable, however, in being one of the very first to recognise Hollywood's new rival, television, though its real target is quiz shows, which were outstandingly popular on both TV and radio at the time. Colman plays a mastermind who enters a quiz show; Vincent Price is very funny as its pretentious and humourless sponsor. An agreeable little diversion which unfortunately tends to peter out during the second half. Not a huge success at the box-office, since the stars sued the producer (Harry M.

918319,5,6304681003,"Last night I was finally able to watch the long anticipated Champagne for Caesar (1950), a United Artists release directed by Richard Whorf, starring Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Celeste Holm, Barbara Britton and Art Linkletter.

Until two or three years ago I hadnt heard nothing about this film, except that I knew that it was one of Ronald Colmans last films, but then, suddenly in some site I read some high praise with regard to this movie, describing it as a kind of undiscovered gem, so I immediately put this Image DVD release on my Amazon Wish List and I got it very recently as a gift.

First of all, to watch such a fine print of this film was a plus, because, since it's a Public Domain film, there are many bad quality copies circulating on the market. The image quality of this Image DVD release (no pun inteded) is superb.

This offbeat comedy, which is quite screwballish, is highly, highly enjoyable and quite unique. Ronald Colman is simply delightful as the know-it-all bookworm who decides to ruin a soap company, participating in a trivia quiz TV/Radio show; he manages to make his character quite pleasant and warm. Vincent Prices is equally good as the eccentric owner of Milady Soap Company, who repeatedly falls into trances when thinking about new ideas or getting inspired. The names of their characters are very funny: Beauregard Bottomley and Burnbridge Waters, respectively. Priceless.

Celeste Holm appears late in the film as the Femme Fatale whos hired by Mr. Waters to teach a lesson, neutralize and ruin the conceited Mr. Bottomley. Her name? Flame ONeill (LOL). She plays her comedic role deftly opposite Colman and Price. What a trio!

Barbara Britton as Colmans sister is also very good and is perhaps the most sensible person in the whole film. Shes so pretty and charming. Film buffs have to check her great performance opposite Ray Milland in Frank Borzages rarely seen masterpiece Till We Meet Again (1944). Art Linkletter plays the host (what else?) of the Radio/TV Show who lures Ms. Britton. Mention apart deserves Beauregards tipsy parrot, Caesar, whose voice belongs to Mel Blanc.

Lyle Talbot has a very small role as one of the executives of the Milady soap company.

A very good comedy. Recommended.",1458000000,,2250,4.87434554973822

918328,4,6304681003,"I was going to buy the very inexpensive DVD of this film but was warned away from it by numerous reviews on Amazon complaining that the sound was very bad, so bad that it was painful to listen to.  So I found this VHS version (the one pictured above), in a new and sealed copy, from an online seller, and I've just listened to it.  The picture is perfectly clear, and the sound is perfectly audible.  There are a few tiny flaws in the image here and there, as commonly appear in old films, but they are all momentary and don't seriously distract one from enjoying the film.  And if the picture and sound aren't razor-sharp, neither are they blurry or muffled.  The volume was certainly strong; I had to turn my TV volume control down to watch the film.  I had no problem hearing the dialogue.

The VHS runs close to 100 minutes, which is the time given on the IMDb.

The story is amusing.  This is not, for the most part, a laugh-out-loud comedy (not like Bringing Up Baby, for example, or A Shot in the Dark); it is a ""smile and chuckle"" comedy.  The plot is clever, and the humor of the situation grows on you as the film progresses.  It's fun to see Colman in a comedy for a change -- he is excellent in it -- funny by not trying to be funny, but simply by conveying his straight-laced character in an intrinsically comedic situation.  Celeste Holm is very good, Vincent Price is also very good, and has some of the best scenes; Barbara Britton, whom I'd never seen before, is also very good as Colman's well-grounded sister.  Art Linkletter, playing a TV show host (""Happy Hogan"") much like himself in real life, is also pretty good.  Overall, a well-crafted light comedy, deserving of a B+ grade and therefore worth seeing for lovers of comedy.

If you don't want to take a chance on the DVD, or if you have the DVD and are seriously dissatisfied with its sound quality, get this VHS.  A good used copy or even a new copy won't cost you that much more than the DVD, if you shop around and bide your time.",1419033600,,2009,4.331550802139038

The VCR's timer had a coding quirk that caused it to stop recording at midnight, so it was a few years before I found out exactly how it ended.

It's fair to say ""they don't make them like this anymore"". It's a smart, sharp satire of game shows, with Ronald Colman as an out-of-work genius who, insulted by the owner of Milady Soap, decides to bankrupt the company by repeatedly winning on Milady's quiz show.

This is the other film she made around that time (1950): a low-budget ""B"" picture named ""Champagne for Caesar.""

At first it seems another throwaway postwar comedy with a silly, implausible plot: unemployable (why?) super-genius, turned down for a research job with a soap factory, proceeds to avenge himself by appearing on a quiz show sponsored by the soap company and winning enough money to take over the soap company. What makes ""Champagne for Caesar"" remarkable is its prescience: not only does it anticipate the quiz show scandals of the ensuing decade, but the general dumbing down of American culture, neatly summed up by star Ronald Colman: ""If it's noteworthy and rewarding to note that 2 and 2 make 4 to the accompaniment of applause and prizes, then 2 and 2 is 4 will become the highest level of learning."" Best is the irresistible teaming of Colman and Vincent Price (who, sadly, were reunited only once more, in equally adversarial roles, in the amazing 1957 epic ""The Story of Mankind""). Ms. Holm plays the siren hired by Price to distract Colman from his winning streak. Mel Blanc provides the voice for the title character (a parrot).

Unfortunately, as many others here have pointed out, the picture quality of the DVD release is only adequate and the sound atrocious--downright muddy in places.

Directed by Richard Whorf

Can't think of any other actors at the time who could have played these parts better. Colman manages to make a character who would be despised by most everyone in real life warm and sympathetic. He plays it dead pan without putting anyone down.

This film is a masterpiece of casting. What happens when the man who knows everything goes on a quiz show that doubles your cash prize every time a you answer a question correctly? Beauregard Bottomly (Colman) is that man & what happens is you end up with 40 million dollars on the line.

Ronald Colman and Vincent Price in one of the best screwball comedies to come from the tail end of Hollywood's golden age. Colman and Price are not two names commonly associated with comedy but as this film shows they should have been - where have they been all this time!

Vincent Price is simply hilarious in what is perhaps a career best performance as the anti-intellectual soap company boss Burnbridge Waters.
Good performances by Celeste Holm and surprisingly by Art Linkletter!

Special footnote: -- My good friend in St. Louis, Dale Thielker shared this story with me the other day - ""When I met Vincent Price and told him that his mother had been a patient of the dentist my Mom worked for before her marriage, he remembered my Mom and he also told me that Ronald Colman was by far his all time favorite co-star. He called him ""incredibly humble"".  ""He was bigger than the rest of the cast combined, but you would never know it"".  When Colman learned that one of the camera men was  diabetic and could not have sugar, Ronald brought to the set sugar free cookies and tea for him that Benita Colman made special for him'.

Another Special footnote: -- The title refers to Beauregard Bottomley's alcohol-loving parrot Caesar, voiced by Mel Blanc.

Also the acting debut of Art Linkletter. (He played himself in his first film, People Are Funny.)

It's also a dead-on critique on intelligence and knowledge as viewed by popular culture, advertising, and the ""sheep mentality""...this is beginning to sound a bit dry, but CFC is definitely not that.
Along with Ronald Coleman, Celeste Holm (around the time she made All About Eve), and Vincent Price, there is a very young Art Linkletter (anyone who grew up in LA in the 50s and 60s will remember him).
The recording is a bit blotchy in spots, but still definitely worth getting. It's filmed in black and white which I like because a lot of color movies of that era are a bit garish for my taste.

Also, the appearance of the DVD looks like it was prepared from the VHS video release master tape, not from a film original.  The DVD matches the places where bits were missing from the VHS release. I think that supports this theory, as does the lack of sharpness in the video image.  The sound track of the VHS release (I have two copies) sounds almost like high fidelity compared to the poor sound quality of the DVD.  There may be variation in manufacturing quality which could explain why some reviewers report no sound problem.  That is possible.

Ronald Colman has the lead as know-it-all Beauregard Bottomley and Vincent Price co-stars as Burnbridge Waters-- the owner of Milady Soap Co.

918694,5,6304681003,"Ronald Colman is excellent in this movie as is Vincent Price. It's very entertaining and comical. If you like Arsenic & Old Lace, Talk of the Town, and Harvey you will enjoy this as well.",1231632000,,187,4.371428571428571
918695,4,6304681003,"What a refreshing movie: intelligent dialog, great actors and actresses, a plot with many twists and turns, and funny too. Ronald Colman is superbly cast as the man who knows everything, Celeste Holms as the ""Mata Hari"" hired to bring him down, and Vincent Price as the eccentric captain of industry determined to trip him up. Refreshing too is that intelligence - not fame or beauty - is venerated.

I'd have given the movie a 5 star rating if it where not for the condition of the DVD transfer. In many places the audio sound is blown out. Some scenes are lost: in one particular scene, Vincent is standing under a funnel in his soap factor, poised to hit the level - in the next scene you see him soaked, why? I remember seeing this broadcast on TV when I was younger: he hits the lever and soap suds come pouring down on him. There are some stills in the extra material that suggest this, but what a shame at the loss.

All the same, I'd still recommend this to anyone who might appreciate a playful, innocent, and intelligent romance from times gone by.",1211932800,2,1058,4.448453608247423
918696,4,6304681003,"I first saw this flick more than 25 years ago, and thought it was a hoot. In today's world of idiotic ""reality"" shows, it's just as funny. The cast is just about impeccable. OK, so maybe Art Linkletter isn't perfect romantic-interest material. But my 21-year-old son (who had known Vincent Price only from creep-flicks) was astounded to see VP playing comedy...and playing it very well. His reaction to the ""Chinese dynasty"" answer is a laugh-out-loud moment. So is his final scene with Caesar.

I will agree with other reviewers: at one point, the sound gets distorted, but only for a few minutes. There's also some evidence of film damage, but they are only minor interruptions. Overall, it was a pleasure to view this lost classic again, even with the imperfections.

""Champagne for Caesar"" is a nice bit of froth. But as Paul McCartney once said, ""What's wrong with that?/I need to know...""",1202947200,,894,4.875
918697,3,6304681003,"This was one of the earliest movies in which the cinema  industry engaged with the emerging threat posed by TV and it still has some relevance in this age of multi-million dollar quiz and other competiton  programmes.

Ronald Coleman -as another reviewer so astutely observed,cast against type -plays Beauregard Bottomley who applies for employment at a large soap company run by Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price).He is rejected and in revenge eneters a quiz show on TV ,one sponsored by Water's company .He proceeds to win and to win big,getting ever nearer to the $20 million prize .The questions become ever harder but Bottomley answers with ease .We get a twist ending which is perhaps predictable but still neat .

The sub-plot involves Celeste Holm as Nurse Carrie O'Neal -engaged by Waters as an attempt to distract bottomley from his goal .The only misfiring part of the movie involves Barbara Britton as Bottomley's sister as she becomes enamoured of the show's linkman and MC ,played by Art Linklater
Performance are admirable especially the arch and witty contribution from Price and Coleman is ,as ever, splendid
This is an enagaging light comedy and still repays viewing
The movie is amiable and deft but perhaps not quite as sharp as it needs to be -it could have done with being  a tad more acerbic in the manner of ,say ,Billy Wilder",1198800000,,1349,4.899122807017544
918698,4,6304681003,"Some movies have a single element or performance that raise them above the ordinary, and in Richard Whorf's ""Champagne for Caesar"" it's Vincent Price's hysterically funny turn as Burnbridge Waters, a megalomanical soap tycoon whose lofty arrogance and insane rages recall all the megalomaniacal tycoons of the past century, from Howard Hughes to Donald Trump. Waters has the misfortune to arouse the ire of Beauregard Bottomley (Ronald Colman), an unemployed polymath who proceeds to go on the quiz show Waters sponsors, with the express purpose of reducing him to beggary. This very early spoof of TV--so early that they refer to the quiz show as ""a radio program"" most of the time--is otherwise a fairly mild affair that relies too heavily on funny names and an alcoholic parrot (boozing animals were big in the early '50s) for its humor. Colman--he of the impeccably debonair appearance and incomparably musical voice--shines in a role that normally in that era would have gone to Clifton Webb. Colman is warmer and less acerbic than Webb, a major plus for the film. But why did the filmmakers give the late-fiftyish, veddy British Colman a late-twentyish sister (Barbara Britton) with a California accent? Why did they wait until halfway through the film to introduce the lovely and charming Celeste Holm, and why did they make her character so weird? And--OH MY GOSH--who was the genius who thought Art Linkletter would make an effective romantic comedy lead??? ""Champagne for Caesar"" has only two reasons for existing, although they are excellent reasons--Vincent Price and Ronald Colman. Through the silliness of the script, some unexpectedly prescient lines also appear. Toward the beginning, watching Linkletter's Happy Hogan on the quiz show, Colman's Bottomley remarks that if people are asked the answer to 2+2 on a coast-to-coast hookup, accompanied by flashing lights and loud music, then 2+2 will become the highest aspiration of human knowledge. So now we have shows like, ""Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"" and Donald Trump, our very own Burnbridge Waters, is a TV star in his own right. Oh Bottomley, where are you when we need you?",1196985600,,2154,5.122159090909091
918699,5,6304681003,"This is a classic comedy with Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Celeste Holm and Art Linkletter.  A genius tries to put a show out of business to help his own financial problems.

918700,4,6304681003,"Champagne for Caesar is a film about a man (Ronald Colman) who finds television game shows incredibly stupid and a waste of time. He is disgusted to find that people enjoy seeing others answer mindless questions for small prizes, and even more so when the owner of the company that sponsors the program (Vincent Price) refuses to hire him because he has a sense of humor. To get his revenge, he goes on the show to answer intelligent questions about anything ever and becomes a sensation, winning more and more money each week to the detriment of the company. In an attempt to shake this parasite, the company utilizes every tactic it can think of with entertaining results.

If I were judging this film simply on Vincent Price's performance, I would have given this film 5 stars. He is absolutely hilarious as a man best described as a cross between the eccentric Willy Wonka and a hysterical child. He is the best part of the film and is sadly not in enough scenes.

The drawback to the film is that it stars to slow up when Celeste Holm's character comes into the story because a relationship must be formed between two characters. Although she adds more depth to the story, she also hinders the flow of it.

Overall, however, this film features accessible comedy and is a shining example of old Hollywood carrying over into modern film.",1137456000,3,1340,4.6455696202531644
918701,4,6304681003,"Ronald Colman is perfectly cast as reserved, erudite and unemployed scholar Beauregard Bottomley the possessor of an encyclopedic array of knowledge.  Colman is spurned for a chance of employment at the Milady Soap Co. by wacky and devious owner Burnbridge Waters played by Vincent Price due to a personality clash.  Price who shows an undeniable penchant for comedy in his role, really raises Colman's ire.  Colman decides to get even by becoming a contestant on a Milady sponsored quiz show.

Colman quickly proves that his knowledge is all encompasing in the double or nothing quiz show hosted by Happy Hogan played effortlessly by Art Linkletter.  He decides to keep on going until he amasses 40 million dollars which will put Price out of business.  Price tries by any means to derail Colman and finally hires Celeste Holm playing Flame O'Neil to distract Colman with her charms.

Alls well that ends well and everybody lives happily ever after. The interplay in dialogue between actors especially Colman, Price and Linkletter demonstrates excellent and witty screenplay writing and makes the film fast moving and enjoyable.

Incidently Caesar refers to Colman's loquacious pet parrot who has a partiality for alcohol especially champagne.",1128297600,3,1244,5.247474747474747
918702,4,6304681003,"This film has Oscar winner Ronald Colman's last starring performance.  (He only had small roles in two later films.)  After its failure at the box office, Colman did a radio show (""The Halls of Ivy""), and in 1954 starred in a TV adaptation of that radio show for a year.  Meanwhile, ""Caesar"" developed a cult following when it was shown on TV (appropriately, since it is all about the way TV saturates a nation's consciousness).  Now that the film's available on DVD, perhaps it can find a new audience.  Colman is matched by two strong character actors in this film: Vincent Price, even more flamboyant than he was in ""His Kind of Woman"" (1951), and Celeste Holm, another Oscar winner (for supporting actress in ""Gentleman's Agreement""), who doesn't appear until halfway through but dominates the second half as a wide-eyed femme fatale.  The surreal offices at the Milady soap company show superior art directors at work.  The dialogue is crackling and quotable, but the plotting has problems (several times, we are told what's about to happen before it does). Moreover, the two love relationships aren't convincing (Colman's character looks happier living his sister, played by the lovely and charming Barbara Britton).  The continuing gimmick with the drunken parrot (voiced by Mel Blanc) is hysterical.  All in all, a film well worth seeing.",1116720000,13,1346,5.027027027027027

Vincent Price is the owner of the soap company that sponsors the show, and is afraid of going bankrupt because of Beau's success.

7876546,4,6304681003,"Bottom Line: A persons has to have a mean streak to completely dislike Champagne for Caesar. The main plot is fairly basic but there are enough variations for it to be called original. Ronald Coleman and Vincent Price pretty much own the screen. I had never before seen Art Linkletter in a movie and the Celeste Holm role is well written. The mood is generally light and the satire friendly. A few real laughs and generally a merry time. Recommendation: Champagne for Caesar may be a one-time rental but it is certainly worth watching.

By the 1950s the notion of television game shows as a get rich quick gimmick was well established.  The too smart for his own good genius was a standard character and the scheming corporate mastermind and the hired heart breaker were hardly new ideas. In Champagne for Caesar directors Richard Whorf and writers Hans Jacoby, Frederick Brady start with all these basics and through a succession of soft balls with just enough curves get something fresh.

Ronald Coleman as Beauregard Bottomley is a man who knows so much he is unemployable. He is as smooth as Ronald Coleman can be and too smart for any of the usual movie tricks. Bottomley determines to use the game show sponsored by the rude company owner Bumbridge Water (Vincent Price) not as a route to riches, but as a petard upon which he can hoist the man who would not give him a job.
Vincent Price as the man to be so hoisted is a strange duck, given to other worldly trances, and displays of manic near insanity. In short, Vincent Price mostly has fun.

Art Linkletter as the host of the quiz show is a wise cracker ala Bing Crosby but otherwise a nice guy. Celeste Holmes as the hired heartbreaker, Flame ONeal is mercenary enough, but also bright.

In short no one is exactly a stereotype, and the plot runs on a track close to, but not the same as the one you expect. Champagne for Caesar has no violence, nothing rude or otherwise inappropriate for a family movie night. There are some broadside swipes at Americas fascination with television celebrities, almost anticipating some of the 2016 reality stars. There is the usual stuff about eggheads, but the egghead is our hero.

The opening sequence with the pneumatic Marylyn Monroe blonde bimbo send up (Ellye Marshall as Frosty) is a nice little joke in itself.
