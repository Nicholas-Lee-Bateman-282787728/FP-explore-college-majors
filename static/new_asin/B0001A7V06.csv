8173660,3,B0001A7V06,This film had some decent fight scenes although I found that the kid in this movie was very irritating and took away from the flow of the film. The Shaolin monks character could havebeen more interesting and aggressive.,1202169600,,219,4.7894736842105265
8173661,1,B0001A7V06,Dont waste your time. This is a terrible movie. Frigging super bad dubbing makes it worse. A little kid is beating up big men and the custumes are cheesy.,1201219200,,154,4.344827586206897
8173662,5,B0001A7V06,"I saw this flick "" The wandering Monk"" in my early teen,,and remember really enjoying it.  After searing high and low for this flick,,I came across it in Paris, France in 2004.  This is not your typical 5 star movie, but more like 4 stars,,,,but for me,,this flick was one of the few which really developed my passion for old school kung fu,,therefore, I cannot give it anything less than 5 stars!!  The old school kung fu is absolutely amazing,,if you enjoy the crane style,,this movie depict that immensely.  The fight scenes are frequent and nothing less than amazing, the story is great and the choreography off the chizzel!!  Rest assured,,,you can't, and will not go wrong with this one in your collection!!",1151712000,5,713,4.764227642276423
