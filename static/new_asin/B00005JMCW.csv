1498387,5,B00005JMCW,"Directed by Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Head Over Heals) this is one of those rare remakes where the premise is the same but the twist on modernizing really works. It is funny and extremely well character developed.
The story is that of a modern day mom and daughter who are opposites and at odds with each other. All mothers and daughters argue and in the heat of the moment may say things they really don't mean at the time.  Through the mystical magic of an Asian Woman and a fortune cookie the mothers get the wish  they switch bodys and not for any particular time period  but they get to go back when they realize what their relationship is all about.
It stars Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies, House Arrest) in one of the best comedic performances in her career. She is so great with her timing and attitude  because she basically goes from being a middle-aged woman to a teenager. He use of the language, mannerism and her comic timing is perfect. Jamie is clever and inventive and took her performance to the top. She is hysterical in the real business world playing her mother- a Lawyer.
Supported by Lindsay Lohan (Life Size, The Parent Trap) as her daughter who sharpens her performance as an overbearing, professional middle-aged women in a teenagers body.
They spend the remainder of the movie trying to figure out, very comically how to get back into each others original body.  Mark Harmon (Chicago Hope, Wyatt Earp) plays the sympathetic and confused fianc for the recently divorced Jamie Lee. The little brother played by Ryan Malgarini (Gilmore Girls) gets caught in the middle and is hysterical in his confusion.
This film is great fun for the whole family. And will be available in December on DVD. Dont miss it. It is very good and extremely wholesome. (11-10-03)",1068422400,2,1788,4.699680511182109
1498388,5,B00005JMCW,"This story has been told about how many times? Probably a million, right? - okay maybe less. But who cares? Because it's not the story you tell but the way that you tell it that counts. This is a great movie. The story is about an engaged-widowed-working mother who is constantly bickering with her funky-opinionated-guitar-playing teenage daughter. An older chinese woman sees the two fighting and decides to interject by putting a curse on them which causes them to switch places. When they wake up in the morning, the daughter is in the mothers body and the mother is in the daughters body. They have to try to go about eachothers day without bringing notice to anyone else that anything has changed all while trying to figure out how to get back to their original bodies - and they have to do so soon - the mother is set to get re-married the next day and the daughter is scheduled for a pivitol band audition. But, what starts off as a curse just might be a blessing in disguise when each has to be in the others shoes for a day.
This movie is a really great family movie. Kids love it, adults love it. What mother and daughter can't relate to this movie? Highly recommended!",1068249600,,1180,4.467592592592593
1498389,5,B00005JMCW,"This film works because the actors are able to play eachother convincingly and to humourous ends. A fine film to watch with your kids (and there are not many like that lately).

The background situations setting up the mother-daughter tension are more compelling, and the switched mother-daughter characterizations are much more convincing, than those in the 1976 original.

I don't know any teens that act the way the kids in the movie do.  The original is much better. It should be on the Prime free section not a paid movie to stream.,1483574400,,296,4.157894736842105

1499513,5,B00005JMCW,"We love to watch movies out in our yard, projected up on a screen my husband built. In the cold weather months, we will have movie parties indoors with the movie going in the front room and the TV room to accommodate all our guests, as our house is not huge. We invite friends and family over and love to have movie theme dinners. Of course, we have to have Chinese food with this movie! It makes for a very good time and this movie brings a lot of laughs and fun memories together. In fact, this is absolutely one of our favorite go-to movies for a good laugh.

Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are both completely believable and brilliant in their roles in Freaky Friday in this role reversal movie. They are crazily spot on in their interpretation of how each other would handle a situation or react. It really is hilarious. The supporting actors are all perfectly casted as well. We still call this the new Freaky Friday, even though it was released in 2003, as opposed to the old Freaky Friday that was released in 1977 and is the one we grew up with. They really are both good, but this is one of the times when a movie redo turned out even better.  If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out. Give it a try. Everyone who has watched it with us has loved it! Have a little extra fun and order Chinese food for dinner. Always lovely to have a reason for a party and making memories!",1462406400,3,1399,4.2556390977443606

1499622,4,B00005JMCW,"We had never even heard of this movie until a friend recommended it recently when I asked for a good mother/daughter movie. My daughter is 13 and there's only so many "" in between"" movies you can get, not rated R and not for little kids. So this was a really good match. If your daughter is about 10-13, I think it's a nice fun movie to watch together. Does it have dumb parts? sure. but there is a lesson to be learned, as in most movies, so it's a good saturday afternoon family movie. Even a bunch of teen girls would love to watch it as a sleepover movie.",1458000000,2,559,4.090909090909091

Takes some brilliant acting to be an adult that has to act and think like a teenager and pull it off to where you love the character instead of think, ""what an idiot.""  Probably one of Lindsey Lohan's best performances, too.  Convincing young lady, too bad her real life has gotten so messed up you can't enjoy her talents still.  Mark Harmon's character could've stood some better developing, but he's so hot just being in the movie makes a woman drool. Great movie to watch with your kids.",1410912000,,594,4.481481481481482

The story itself is engaging and it moves along at a brisk clip.  The dialog is witty...when Ms Curtis trilled, ""Make good choices!"" as her ""daughter"" got out of the car at school, my daughter and I cracked up.  The movie is visually interesting, has some good music, and has a great supporting cast (who doesn't want to see Mark Harmon in something besides NCIS?).

1500626,4,B00005JMCW,"I haven't seen the original ""Freaky Friday"", but this remake is pretty good.  God only knows what sort of practice Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan went through so they could act like each other...by the way, am I the only one who cracked up when Lohan acted all proper and mature?  I'm sorry, but that requires a serious suspension of disbelief in any movie she's in.  Also, should Mark Harmon have slapped some heads here and there?  He was good, but he was too subdued based on what I know about him.  Come on, this is the guy who made headlines playing serial killer Ted Bundy and later NCIS Special Agent Gibbs...be tough, man.  He was pretty amusing though...my favorite scenes were whenever all the men attempted to stay out of the women's fights.  Overall, it's a decent film that can be enjoyed if you want to just kick back and enjoy a movie.  It's got plenty of laughs and a good plot and the cast all do pretty well.

1500628,5,B00005JMCW,"I bought both versions of Freaky Friday - the new and the old.  I loved them both!!  As someone who grew up with the first version, it was fun to revisit it.  In comparing the two I thought that Barbara Harris and Jamie Lee Curtis both did wonderful jobs as the mothers turned daughters.  I also thought that Jodie Foster showed just how brilliant she is as an actor.  I thought that Lindsey Lohan was the weak link with the newer version - I couldn't stop thinking that the somewhat freaky teenager she presents in this movie is the all too real person that she became . . .

1500634,5,B00005JMCW,"Immensely cute, charming and entertaining, and the acting is stellar.

That said, take this simple multiple-choice test:

You find yourself mentally inhabiting your teenager's body (for no particularly satisfactory reason). Do you:

1) immediately go looking for the services of a competent wizard, shaman or thaumaturgical practitioner of some sort?

2) figure you've gone insane, and check yourself into a psychiatric hospital?

3) assume that it's temporary, and that tomorrow, you'll wake up and find that you've been transformed into a giant cockroach named ""Gregor?""

4) take it as a win-win (you get an extra 20 years, and the kid doesn't have to wait around for adulthood), so you move to another town and assume new identities on a permanent basis?

OR

5) Go to high school to make sure you don't miss your kid's very important classes and exams, because what's the complete destruction of your identity (and the overthrow of any semblance of order in the universe) compared to making sure that classes aren't missed?

If you answer anything but 5, then you're probably perfectly sane, but if you do choose what's behind door number 5, then you'll be able to understand the (otherwise inexplicable) behavior of the characters in this movie, and you should probably take up Hollywood scriptwriting --  right after you have your (new) head examined.",1397520000,,1357,5.099547511312217

This particular version of Freaky Friday is a remake of the original, but it just might be the best of the lot. The acting is superb. Lindsay Lohan was so sweet, fresh and real... At least that moment was captured on film. Jamie Lee Curtis is downright hilarious as the mother trapped in her wayward child's body.

A mom and daughter can't get along. So, with a little Chinese magic, they are switched to each other's body - Mom in daughter's form, girl in mom's form. They try to pretend to the outside world that all is the same - until they can patch it up - but their barely ability to do so turns out pretty hilarious some times.

Pros: They learn to understand each other's world, walk in each other's shoes for the day.

Cons: Verbal fighting, stress, some quite immodest moments while dressing...",1392076800,,621,4.4298245614035086

1500721,5,B00005JMCW,"Nothing wrong with the disc or the cover. Remakes are always tricky...especially when Disney wants to remake one of their own. Reviving the ""Love Bug"" was serviceable and nice, but was mired in a tired and formula plot. But that wasn't a problem with this one! A slick, double-funny, intelligently written family comedy from director Mark Waters. Deftly handled, Waters keeps the picture moving brisky without giving up any of the flavor. Kudos to both Jamie Lee and Lindsay who expertly act like each other in the ol' switcheroo body-switching mode. They really did their homework in studying each other and then portraying each other...and it shows on the screen. Mark Harmon is also terrific as the confused yet understanding groom-to-be. Rarely have I seen a family comedy that does NOT demean or talk down to the lower-common denominator of their audience. A GREAT film that should NOT be missed!",1391644800,,901,5.013333333333334

1500909,5,B00005JMCW,"Like its predecessor 1998's ""The Parent Trap"", this is Walt Disney Pictures remake/update of their original film, also both ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Freaky Friday"" star Lindsay Lohan.  The difference is while ""The Parent Trap"" remake was as good as the 1961 original, although in a different way, this 2003 remake of 1976's ""Freaky Friday"" is much better than the original with Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster.  It's updated neatly into the twenty-first century with expert comic tandem acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.

As the film opens it's a Thursday morning in Los Angeles, psychoanalyst Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) a widowed mother of two is planning to get remarried to Ryan (Mark Harmon) on Saturday.  While her young son Harry (Ryan Malgarini) seems all right with this, her rebellious teen-aged daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) isn't happy about it.  Anna and Tess also clash about Anna's schoolwork, band, appearance and general attitude, there is a definite generation gap.  At a family dinner that night at a Chinese restaurant, they openly battle in front of the owner's elderly mother who offers them fortune cookies which she insists they take.  Upon breaking the cookies they read the enigmatic fortune inside and experience an earthquake that only they can feel.  The next morning upon awakening Tess and Anna find to their horror they have somehow switched places, and each will have to experience the other's Friday, and try somehow to find a way to switch back before Saturday's wedding.  Through the course of the ""Freaky Friday"" each learns that the other's life is not quite as smooth or easy as she thought, as they try to get through the craziness of the day.

Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are exceptional at capturing the dual roles they play.  I was particularly impressed by the way both women were able physically to suggest the change in character.  For example when Ms. Curtis is Anna in Tess' body, she is tends to be more relaxed in her posture, tends to lope along, slouching whereas Ms. Lohan as Tess in Anna's body is more rigid and precise in her movements.  They also tend to capture the subtle nuances of the other, and have a keen comic rapport, playing off exceptionally well with one another.  In a word, their performances are inspired and FUNNY, with some heartwarming moments as well, and give the film the sparkle that makes it work so well.  The supporting cast is fine, starting with Mark Harmon as Ryan, who is the perfect likeable fianc for Tess, and young Ryan Malgarini as Harry, Anna's mischievous younger brother has some expert facial expressions as he reacts to a couple of bewildering situations.  The others Chad Michael Murray as Jake, Anna's would be boyfriend, Harold Gould as Grandpa, Christina Vidal and Haley Hudson as Anna's girlfriends, Rosalind Chao as Pei-Pei owner of the Chinese restaurant, Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Bates, Anna's obnoxious teacher and Willie Garson as Evan, Tess' most neurotic patient, all good.

The screenplay by Heather Hatch and Leslie Dixon is a nicely done update of the original Mary Rodgers novel that was published in 1972, originally the mother was a housewife, here she is a working mother, while the daughter was a gawky thirteen year old with very few interests other than the boy next door, here she is fifteen and very interested in her band and music.  It's clever, and very amusing, and as I mentioned above gives both Misses Curtis and Lohan a chance to shine.  Besides this, it's very family friendly, younger kids can definitely watch and probably enjoy themselves.

The music used is pretty good as well, starting with the 60's classic ""Happy Together"" by the Turtles played over the credits showing various paintings/photos which riffs into an updated version as the movie begins.  Anna's band's music I think will bridge the generation gap, both kids and parents can enjoy, Lindsay Lohan gets a solo at the end, and sounds pretty good. Best of the special features probably is the ""Backstage Pass with Lindsay Lohan"" a behind the scenes look at the film.  So sad to see Lindsay Lohan still relatively normal and unspoiled, considering her recent troubled history.  There is a deleted scene that really was not a great loss to the film, and also two alternative endings plus the ending used in the film, actually not much different in the various versions.  However director Mark Waters talks about the deleted scene and the various endings so the viewer is given his perspective.  There is a cute ""bloopers"" set, and two music videos, Lillix ""What I Like About You"", not bad, cute bit of business with Lindsay Lohan in it.  The second one I didn't especially care for, Halo Friendlies ""Me vs. the World"".

Bottom line,  I highly recommend `""Freaky Friday"" it's a bright, lighthearted film that is very enjoyable entertainment  in the best Disney tradition, but which has an underlying message.  You could say it's that very old maxim ""Don't judge another human being until you walked a mile in his/her shoes"", or in this case body!",1380585600,,5071,4.890186915887851

1501240,3,B00005JMCW,"I think most everyone I know has seen the original Disney classic `Freaky Friday', the one with Jodie Foster.  I haven't.  I haven't even seen the original `Parent Trap', starring Hayley Mills either.  Not surprisingly, considering that I was born in the 80's, I've seen both the remakes starring Lindsay Lohan.  I really loved 1998's `The Parent Trap' (for which Lohan should have been up for an Oscar if you ask me) and so I was really excited about seeing `Freaky Friday'.  Sadly, this happened around the time that Lohan's star was rising and her personal life was tanking and, well, it shows in the fact that her acting skills are limited.

She had presence, sure (just look at her) and she had major draw because she was young and pretty and young pre-teen girls and boys wanted to watch her in everything, but the talent level had pretty much leveled off and she didn't have the same spark and charisma she possessed as a child actress.  Here, she is just kind of boring.

The real show stealer here is Jamie Lee Curtis, who clowns her way through each scene with serious energy that makes a giant impact.  Some of the scenes seem foolish and amateurish (like, she's portraying a teenager, not a child) but she pretty much nails not only the bipolar emotions but also the physical comedy, which can be really difficult to pull off so well.  Still, even with her hilarious performance, this film just doesn't reach the heights I wanted it to.  It isn't very well etched out and the jokes don't feel fresh by any means.  The stuffiness of the film as a whole is a deterrent for it lacks the spark to keep it invigorating.

After having a big fight with each other on Thursday, Anna (Lohan) and Tess (Curtis) switch bodies on Friday morning, and throughout the entire day, you see hilarious moments as Tess acts like a rebelious teenager and Anna acts more mature.

Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job as usual; and Lindsay Lohan is far better in this role than any of her other efforts to this point. I was pleased to see than the original, slapstick father has been replaced by a believable boyfriend, played by Mark Harmon.

This 'happily ever after' ending leaves room for a sequel, but I hope that Disney won't go there. It is time to stop making Part 2 for every Disney movie. Part 1 is just fine with me.",1206748800,3,692,4.234848484848484

Lindsay Lohan's partying ways in her personal life overshadow her acting abilities, but with the right roles, she's great, and she flawlessly pulls this role off.

1501537,5,B00005JMCW,"I am generally apprehensive regarding remakes because they are often inferior to the original. I avoided this movie in the theaters for that reason. Eventually we got the DVD and I gritted my teeth to watch. To my surprise the remake covers new territory in switch films and was quite enjoyable.

As with the original, the interplay is between mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell Coleman (Lindsay Lohan). However, in the original the daughter, played by Jodi Foster, was the stronger of the two roles and the mother just didn't quite spark my interest after the switch. In this movie both characters play well and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once again what a great actress she is.

The best part of the movie is that the update is very modern. Annabell is faced with motorcycle riding hunks, is a member of a hard rock group, and wants to get more piercings. The character of Annabell is wonderfully rebellious yet not completely out of control.

As with many teens, Annabell and her mother are arguing about something constantly. With a bit of Asian magic, and a rather tricky fortune cookie, mother and daughter switch bodies. The switch itself is hilarious. One of the scenes played in advertisements continuously is when Annabell, now in Tess' body, looks in the mirror and says that she's the Crypt Keeper. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfectly believable after the transition.

We soon find that each really struggles with the other's world. Annabell can't keep up with all her mother's cell phones, PDA, and beeper. Further, driving seems to be quite a challenge for her. Tess discovers that her daughter was telling the truth about the English teacher who is continually out to get her, regardless of how well she does. It turns out that the English teacher and Tess know each other. Tess solves Annabell's problem quite nicely. However, Tess still has other problems, particularly with Annabell's friends. The peak of Tess' problems are during a rock audition that is very important to Annabell.

There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice. Tess is preparing to get married to Ryan (Mark Harmon), who is trying to understand his soon-to-be-daughter but, as with many fathers, is more than a little clueless. Annabell also has a younger brother that she sees as a pest. The switch allows candid conversations between Annabell and Ryan and Annabell and younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) where Annabell learns that Ryan doesn't want to upset her life and truly wants to understand her and Harry loves her and admires her. The poignant moments are handled quite well with minimal schmaltz.

The true point of the movie is for each to walk in the other's shoes. In the process of doing so we get to see some well done physical and situational comedy, most particularly by Jamie Lee Curtis. Both Tess and Annabell are both empathetic characters. While the focus is on the ladies, making this a mother-daughter film, males will enjoy the generational myopia of mother and daughter. A wonderful family film that I consider suitable for most family members.",1157673600,,3091,4.90057361376673
1501538,3,B00005JMCW,"Having been a lifelong fan of Mary Rodgers' classic novel ""Freaky Friday,"" as well as the Disney version from 1976 that let Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris play superego and id respectively, I approached this remake with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.  Though much of Rodgers' novel is again (needlessly) reworked and cast aside, this remake has a flat-out scrumptious bonbon wrapped up in the recycled packaging: Jamie Lee Curtis.  If the 1976 version gave the edge to Foster's crisp, no-nonsense adult-in-a-teenager's body, this version lets Curtis as the teenager-in-the-adult loose on the park swings, and she doesn't stop until she's conquered the entire playground.  (As the daughter/mother, the adorable Lindsay Lohan mostly plays an adult via a bright, hyper-competent smile and careful elocution, though her punk-pop singing is joyfully  effective.)  Supporting actors like Harold Gould and Mark Harmon are mostly furniture (Harmon looks like you could dust him).  It's Curtis, with her vulpine smile and sexy swagger as she racks up the charge card, who inspires giggle fits of happiness, and when she and her daughter's boyfriend (Chad Michael Murray) breathlessly discuss bands they love in a coffee shop, it's pure, mooney bliss.  Great art it isn't, but it sure is fun, especially for tweeners and their ex-90's-riot grrllll moms.",1154476800,2,1354,5.3584905660377355

1501543,5,B00005JMCW,"I had a lot of fun watching Disney's remake of Freaky Friday. In some ways this updated version improves on the themes of the original 1970's version. Funny and smart, Disney's Freaky Friday makes a great date movie or a great family movie.

The story follows a family days before a widow's wedding to her new fianc. Daughter and mother are at odds with each other over the upcoming nuptials A trip to the Chinese restaurant and a fortune cookie lead to daughter and mother switching bodies and experiencing each other's lives. It's only when they come to appreciate each other that things change back. I know I'm leaving a lot out; (I usually write detailed synopses in my reviews) but I really want people to watch this movie and experience it for themselves. Disney's Freaky Friday is JUST TOO GOOD TO SPOIL

This movie is a lot of fun; the jokes are hilarious and the music is great. My favorite scenes are the collision in the bedroom between Anna and her Mother. I also liked the talk show sequence and the scenes in the car with some McDonald's fries (I can relate.) Really funny stuff. The updated script is well written and the cinematography is solid.

Disney did a great job of casting their version of Freaky Friday. Each actor and actress is perfectly cast in their roles. Lindsay Lohan gives a strong performance as Anna. For a young actress she handles the dual role very well, making both a convincing teenager and middle aged woman trapped in a teenage body. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in this movie. Her performance here is worth the purchase of the DVD alone; the way she transitions from middle aged woman to hot teenager trapped in a middle aged woman's body are incredible. Her scenes with Chad Michael Murray made the movie for me. I could actually feel the chemistry swirling between them. She needs to be in more movies; I love watching her perform. Chad Michael Murray is in top form here as Anna's love interest. They need to let him do more on One Tree Hill. Veteran actor Harold Gould gets some great lines in some key scenes. Mark Harmon (NCIS) is a surprise as the mom's love interest. Nice to see him playing something light and funny for once. Look for Christina Vidal as Anna's bandmate.

Both versions of Freaky Friday are Shawn James five star Essential Movies. After almost 30 years the story is on its way to becoming a modern classic. While you're buying this one pick up the original 1970's version and the great book both movies are based on.",1148860800,5,2486,4.592342342342342
1501544,4,B00005JMCW,"The nominal plot of this movie is formulaic. Mother (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Lindsay Lohan) are at each others' throats, all day every day. Through magical means, each spends a day living the other's life. They reach a new understanding of each other in a tearful rapprochement, and everyone ends up back where they belong. The end. (The fact that Curtis's character was a therapist and had so little respect or understanding to start with makes me think of shoemakers' children going barefoot, but we'll let that slide.)

If you have a couple of hours to kill, that much offers a merciful way to euthanize them. What lifts this movie above banality is the physical comedy that both lead actresses bring to the show. Lohan has a few good moments, including some motherly primping of her daughter, Curtis. Her best is the ""That's not mine!"" sequence when the mother wakes up inside her of her daughter and takes inventory of the unfamiliar body parts. It really isn't a memorable performance, though. That's OK, because Curtis more than makes up for it. She manages all the teenish petulance and gawkiness you could want, channeling not only her own inner child but a few other people's as well. It's a role you simply have to see. Writing about it would be like explaining a joke. It might get the point across, but only at the cost of everything that makes it worthwhile.

It's family-safe and amusing. Against all odds, it rises to one's expectations - as long as you set them low enough.

In addition to that, it also points a problem between parents and teenagers which is lack of understanding. Through the switch, Tess Coleman and Anna better understand each other such as their problems, difficulties, pressure so on and so forth. Anna realized her mother's life isn't that perfect after all while Tess Coleman understands her daughter's problems at school such as the conflict with the history teacher and the constant detention. They both change a lot through the movie. At the end, they know how to get along with each other. I really like the ending!

'Freaky Friday' is no exception (although Jamie Lee Curtis does steal the show here).  If your familiar with the original then you know the plot lines, mother and daughter don't get along, ever, and with a magic spell they switch bodies and are forced to live in each others shoes.  Each one feels the others life is so much easier than theirs but what they are soon to find out is that they really underestimate the other.  Whats so charming about this film is that nothing seems forced, the comedy the acting is all genuine.  When they switch theres no sign of their previous charactor, for Jamie Lee Curtis 'becomes' Lindsay Lohan and visa versa.  Put them in situations strange to them and hilarity ensues.  Great acting on all fronts, even by supporting charactors played by Chad Michael Murray & Mark Harmon who play the boy Anna (Lohan) is in love with and the man Tess (Curtis) is engaged to.

1501603,4,B00005JMCW,"Lindsay Lohan is a very funny actress; this movie does not disappoint.

Jamie Lee Curtis is also a sucess.

Anna is the typical 15/16 yearold girl in California, but an amazing guitar player who also has a huge crush on Chad Michael Murray (not in real life; his character, Jake).

Tess Coleman (J. L. Curtis) is a physiciatrist who's just written a book about mother-daughter relationships and has found true love again, after her husband died 3 years ago.

The story begins on an ordinary Thursday, but today Anna's band has been offered an AMAZING audition at ""The House of Blues,"" or something like that.

This audition means an INCREDIBLE chance for their band- but there's a catch: it's tomorrow night, the night of Dr. Coleman's rehearsal dinner and Anna can't miss that!

That night at a Chinese restaurant, Anna and Dr. Coleman argue loudly until they are interrupted by ""Pei Pei's Crazy Mother,"" who gives them each a fortune cookie. Immediately after they read it, a strange earthquake occurs, one that no one but themselves felt.

The next day, Anna and her mother have switched bodies.

The movie is hilarious, but I think that, trying to reach more teen audiences, Dr. Coleman gains respect for her daughter, but the daughter fairly little for her mother's lifestyle; in other words, the makers of the movie sided too closely with the teenager.",1141862400,,1358,4.848484848484849

Disney's Freaky Friday retains it's charms and fits well with the mold of today's drama-filled teen (in this case, Lindsay Lohan, who gives a hilarious role). Jamie Lee Curtis as Tess Coleman delivers a one-of-a-kind performance in this one. One of her best actually. And Chad Michael Murray as Lohan's love interest delivers well. (although the whole cover of Baby One More Time sent me reeling lol)

1501649,4,B00005JMCW,"Reading magazines and watching the news now, it's hard to believe that just two years ago, Lindsay Lohan was a beautiful, talented young actress who was on her way to becoming the next Ann-Margret, flaming red hair and all. Nowadays, she has become a talentless, wafer thin cleb, like all the other Hollywood stars.

Oh well. But we could always look back on her early film work and enjoy the Lindsay that people loved. The red headed Irish girl with a million dollar smile, not the stick thin blonde that most people can't stomach. ""Freaky Friday"", the remake of the 1976 classic, gave the then 17 year old starlet her big break. It was her second film in seven years (following her debut in the ""Parent Trap"" remake), and might well be her best performance to date.

Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis in top form) and her daughter Anna (Lohan) are two complete opposites. Tess is a successful pyschologist. Anna is a rebellious, punk rock living teen who can't stomach her mothe ror the fact that she is going to have a new dad, Harry (Mark Harmon). Anna's angst is caused by the passing of her father, so having another man take care of her is a harde pill to swallow. One night, the two go to a Chinese restaurant. While there, they have a huge fight, and a waitress gives them a fortune cookie. Then Anna locks herself in a bathroom. A strange, earthquake like occurence happens, and the next morning something happens.

Anna and Tess wake up to realize they've switched bodies. Now, the two must go the days pretending their best to be each other -which, in Disney terms, means disaster. They learn the only way to get back their original forms is to learn to love, honor and respect each other. The fim wraps in a rather formulaic manner, but the film is enjoyable throughout.

The two leading ladies are fantastic. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't been this good in a while, while Lohan proved that at one point she was indeed a force to be reckoned with.

The extras are decent, but it's the film you should watch. It's not the greatest film ever, but it's a wonderful way to pass the time.",1128384000,2,2087,4.525198938992043

Lohan on the other hand (not being a good actress) does a decent job and this is big coming from an actor who thinks way to may girls get movie parts for their looks like lohan. I think Miss. Curtis should make more comedies. She's funny and sexy especially for a woman at her age. I almost rated this film 4 stars and was due to casting lohan.

Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely brilliant as Tess Coleman, a harried psychiatrist with two children, about to remarry after the death of her husband.  Lindsay Lohan plays her daughter Anna, a rebellious teenager who can't see eye to eye with her mother.

Comparing the Lindsay Lohan of this movie with the wafer thin girl she has become, it should be noted that she looked so much prettier, happier and healthier then, that I wish she'd look back at this movie and go out and eat something.

You already know that this is a ""switch"" movie, and thanks to Lucille Soong as an interfering old woman, the switch is done with the crisp snap of a fortune cookie.  Both Curtis and Lohan handle the change in their characters admirably, and soon both Tess and Anna get a first hand understanding of each other's rather complicated lives.

Mark Harmon has a supporting role as Tess' fianc Ryan, and Chad Michael Murray plays Anna's love interest Jake, but this movie is all about the female leads as they get a new perspective, earn each other's respect and generally change each other, while at the same time delivering the laughs.

I said to myself, ""Hmm...I would like to go see a movie tonite!"" I looked at what was playing and nothing really caught my eye. So, I said to myself, ""Oh, I guess I will just go see 'Freaky Friday'!"" I had no clue whatsoever about what the movie was about. I didn't really have too high of expectations for this movie. I went in and took my seat. After the movie was over, I found myself saying ""WOW! That was a good movie!"" The music was great and well suited for the movie and the acting was superb. I decided to return to the movies again the next night.

The next night, I had an even greater reaction to this movie. From that moment on, I knew that this movie was going to become one of my all-time favorite movies. I returned to the movies one last time a week later to enjoy this film for the third time on my 18th birthday. I honestly can't think of any better way I would have liked to spend my 18th birthday rather than in that theater watching ""Freaky Friday"".

All the issues that were dealt in the movie come with a great sence of humor, and because of it those who see it will like it.

The movie is a great one, the actors are very good, and it is for all the family.

1501814,4,B00005JMCW,"""Freaky Friday"" completely revived the ol' ""switcheroo"" genre, only it does it better and is completely more believable. And not only is it more believable, it's actually funny. Not only is it funny, it's just downright funnier than 90% of the garbage out there that passes for a comedy.

The plot snypnosis is quite easy. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the mother, who is a psychiatrist at work, continuously bugged by her phone and pagers going off every minute, readying for a big wedding, and having it rough trying to communicate with her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Anna on the other hand has her share of problems, with a teacher that's failing her for no reason, a friend-turned-bully tormenting her, her obnoxious lil' bro bugging her, not getting along with her mother's fiance, trying oh so desperately to gain attention of the cute guy she adores, and exclaiming her mother is ""ruining her life"" and a ""fun-sucker"" (""sucking the fun out of everything""). Not one understands what goes on in their lives, so they fight and argue constantly. Mother plays psychiatrist to her rebellious daughter to try and understand, but daughter says mom just doesn't understand.

At a resteraunt, they argue again, but then an elderly Chinese woman interferes with their conflict and decides to try and resolve the issue... by giving them fortune cookies. ""Magic"" fortune cookies, to explain better. Both eat them, and thus begins their most unusual experience of their lifetime. They wake up shocked to find their bodies switched. They try to resolve the issue by a ""jolt"" (running into each other). Unfortunately, they can't fix the problem and try to live out the day as trying to be each other.

The result is nothing short of hilarious. Jamie, pretending to be the rebellious teenage girl, completely steals the movie. It's just so funny to see her acting like a teenage girl. When the cute boy Anna likes comes up, Jamie says, ""Oh my God..."" like how a teenage girl would say. She pulls it off so well, you'll just laugh out loud (her saying ""Eww!"" is priceless). Lindsay is also hilarious as being serious and a little Miss Perfect.

Naturally they understand how each other's lives are. They manage to make solve each other's problems and pull off the day as being each other. Sure, it sounds cliched, but how else can it be done? ""Freaky Friday"" is by far one of the best comedies of recent times. The movie pulls off more laughs than a comedy that relies on gross-out or sexual humor.

Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Anna (Lindsay Lohan) Coleman have very frustrating lives.  Tess is a psychologist whose about to get married, yet her job is constantly frustrating her because she is constantly on 2 different cell phones or using a palm pilot.  Anna the daughter seems to be flunking in school, constantly going to detention, and always having to deal with her once best friend-now worst enemy rival in school.  And if that is not enough, both of them are always arguing against each other.  Anna always feels Tess is ruining her life she never listens and barely lets her music with her band.  Tess always feels like Anna acts the way she does because she feels the world revolves around.  But one day a magic spell causes them to wake up in each other's bodies!  Now what are they going to do.  They must somehow find way to switch back because Tess is getting married.  However when living in each other bodies, they both end up learning the difficulties in each other's lives and have a better understanding of each other.  In the end they both learn to have a better respect of each other.

1501858,4,B00005JMCW,"I have to say I liked the book better. The movie is kind of shallow. I like Lindsay Lohan a lot, but for some reason this movie didn't serve a purpose for me.
They twisted the story of the book, which was much better might I add, to make 'Anna' a rebel punk rocker with a bad attitude and a belly button ring. I think I may have appreciated this movie more if it had some more meaning.
Some parts of the movie were really good and some parts were kind of stinky. No offense, but after Chad Michael Murray's character entered the movie, that's when the movie got boring. That's the word. Boring. Not bad, just kind of boring.
Don't get me wrong though, it's a lot better than that Lizzie Maguire movie and What A Girl Wants, and I guess maybe littler kids might like it more than I did. But here's the breakdown.....
THE MOVIE: Definitely worth watching, Definitely worth checking out of the library, Worth renting, Maybe not worth buying until you've seen it.
AGES?: 4-6, probably wouldn't get it. 7-9 May like it. 10-13 - my age group....It was okay...kind of predictable. 13+ - most likely will find it boring.
MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS: Mean Girls (PG-13) for younger kids, The Parent Trap and Cheaper By The Dozen.
OTHER: I recommend Freaky Friday, the book, wholeheartedly.",1089244800,,1274,4.567685589519651

Jamie Lee Curtis does a wonderful job going from a ""understanding"" mother to a daughter that has problems with school and the band that the daughter is a member of, called ""pink slip"".
Jamie Lee Curtis plays Tess, a psychiatrist who is planning her wedding that is coming in a couple days while she trys to undertand what is bothering her daughter, Anna, played by Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohans character Anna is having a tough time getting threw school without getting to trouble from either a girl that used to be one of Anna's best friends or one of her teachers.

In some ways I am & some ways not a very advantaged child. I was always given what I needed & a fair amount of what I wanted. If I wanted more I had to earn it.  She expected everything to be just handed to her,  get real kid!

It makes us think that life ain't easy and being someone different not always changes the difficulties.

Mark Harmon is wisely quiet and understated through the movie letting Mom and Daughter bounce off one another with their crisp, witty, dialogue.
This is a fun-filled frolic and perfectly entertaining. Gather the kids and the guys and sit back and let the laughter roll...",1084924800,,487,5.1
1502023,4,B00005JMCW,"This is the remake of the 1977 original starring one child star Jodie Foster.  Anyone who said remakes stink should reconsider his idea, for the newer ""Freaky Friday"" is one of the delightful family pictures Disney gave us in this decade.
The body-switching story is simple enough.  Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an upright and principled psychatrist (and widow) who is busy preparing for the coming marriage, and her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) is a high school student who wants to have a date with a boy, play rock music; in short, she needs a little bit more freedom.
Then, at a Chinese restaurant, they embarrasingly argue in front of the mother's love Ryan (Mark Harmon).  And then, the owner of the place offers a pair of fortune cookie, which, believe it or mot, have a magical power to change the roles of mother and daughter.  Tess is in Anna's body, and Anna in Tess's.
We know where ""Freaky Friday"" will lead you eventually, so let's wait for the film to be better and funnier as it goes on.  The first 20 minutes may look too banal, following the storyline of typical family pictures (a kid in detention class, mother worrying about her, and so on ...), but that is exactly the point.  After their bodies are switched, the things get wild, crazy, and funny ... probably more funnier than you expect.
That is all because of the two great leading ladies -- Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan (the latter played the double roles in ""The Parent Trap,"" another good remake).  The way Lee Curtis changes the make-up (in the punk fashion, of course) and takes over the TV show with comic talk is one of the many highlights of the film.  With her, Lohan always gives an amusing contrast as a rebellous daughter, then a dutiful one.  (The only reason I do not give five stars is Chinese restaurant setting which looks trite to me -- and I didn't want to see Rosalind Chao in this way -- and its slightly weaker supporting actors).
And most of all, what is great about the film is that Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are not only great talents but also they are having fun doing what they can do.  And this fun is very contagious -- the kind of fun we can all share.",1084838400,,2180,4.482323232323233
1502024,3,B00005JMCW,It's an old story with a predictable storyline.  Jamie Lee is finally starting to look old.  It's a good movie and the acting was pretty good.  It's just this story has already been told tons of times before.,1084060800,,208,4.421052631578948
1502025,4,B00005JMCW,"After my reluctance wore off, I finally watched this film.  I was surprised to find a mildly entertaining return to old parent/child bickering films that I enjoyed during the 80s.  Freaky Friday explores the world of teen angst and the stress-filled responsibilities of adulthood equally and effectively places one inside the other.  Like an intrusion, teenage Anna and working-mother Tess find themselves magically transferred within one another's body after cracking open two fortune cookies at a Chinese restautant.
The rest is history.  The two learn about one another's hectic lives and adapt just long enough to find a way to return to their own bodies and lives.  It is also long enough for the two of them to develop an understanding of one another that was much needed long ago.
As I said, this film is a satisfying return to a lost genre.  I remember the 80s and the genre of films that captured both a young generation and an older generation, reflecting effectively the gap between the two.  Freaky Friday returns to that concept successfully and manages to entertain both generations.",1083974400,,1097,4.9945054945054945
1502026,5,B00005JMCW,"This film really struck a chord with me! I've been where Lindsay Lohan's character was with her on-screen mum, Jamie Lee Curtis. Tell me a teenage daughter who hasn't slammed her bedroom door in protest (and had it removed), yelled at her little brother, not liked her soon to be step-dad, not got on a motorbike because her mother wouldn't have liked it, turns her music up loud, belongs to a rock group, yet pierces her bellybutton without her mother's knowledge.
After watching this, I was on such a high afterwards. I loved the music (I'm getting into that loud music phase now, after my years of cheesy pop, so much so, that my mum had to go upstairs when I was watching this, due to the noise!), Jamie Lee Curtis & Lindsay Lohan actually COULD have been mother and daughter (great casting), and on the whole, the movie was great.
I haven't watched a 'Walt Disney movie' since I was young, so watching this, and now actually owning a non-ANIMATION (it's called a cartoon) movie by them is great.
When Anna and Tess swap minds almost it's so funny! And what happens afterwards, made me appreciate my mum even more - although she hasn't had to put up with me smoking, drinking on street corners, and sleeping with any guy who takes an interest. At least that's something! Unfortunately, I couldn't persuade her to watch this. She doesn't know what's good for her. The way Jamie Lee Curtis manages to change her image - or the way Anna changes her mother's image - is amazing, although I preferred her with the slightly longer hair.
The extras are your average, run of the mill DVD extras to be honest. You get a ""backstage pass"" with Lindsay Lohan, which is quite funny, and you get to see the rehearsals that 'Pink Slip' do. There's also one deleted scene, a blooper reel, and some alternate endings, which are basically all the same!!!
A terrific movie for mothers & daughters to watch together, or for others to have an insight into this lovely and sometimes troublesome relationship.
And on a final note: what is the point in putting easter eggs on DVDs if the person trying to find them isn't smart enough?!",1083628800,2,2115,4.58311345646438

Now, add Jamie Lee Curtis, and you have entertainment, ten-fold.  The two work really well on screen together, and of course the movie's message is one that never ages; kids think parents have it made, and parents think kids have it made.  This movie, as the old one, demonstrate that neither child nor parent have it made.
The acting is good.
The storyline moves along well.
The supporting actors perform well.
The music is good.

Good kids/teen family PG Movie
Summary:
Playful script, good rock `n' roll music, pleasant and funny movie.  Good acting by Lindsay Lohan (the ""Parent Trap"" twins!), and, of course, Jamie Lee Curtis, and surprisingly nice job by Mark Harmon - he really fit the older adopting dad part!
Both Lindsay and Jamie really make great character switches to pull this off.  I expected that from Lindsay since she did such a great job in parent trap; but Jamie really pulled off the idiosyncracies of being a teenager with the right mannerisms, attitude and terminology!
Story:
Anna (Lindsay Lohan) and mother/widow Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) do not relate at all - ironically since Dr. Coleman is a famous psychiatrist who write books on the subject!
A Chinese Fortune Cookie Curse causes them to exchange bodies just before Tess' wedding, leading each other to better understand the daily trials of each others lives.  Walking in each others shoes, Mom finds out that Anna is not just paranoid, but her teacher and ex-best friend are really out to get her; and Anna discovers that Mom's perfect world is not so perfect, and in fact can be a bit scary.  She also learns that maybe everyone in the family is not out to get her like she thought.
Both run a full circle and grow closer through their ordeal.",1076803200,,1306,4.714912280701754
1502178,4,B00005JMCW,"Disney Studios have created an entertaining film with ""Freaky Friday"".  The concept of a mother and daughter changing bodies is fertile ground for all sorts of amusing situations and Jamie Lee Curtis hits all the right notes as the mother.  The beginning of the movie sets the stage as mother and daughter seems to disagree on clothes, curfews, boyfriends, and just about any other subject which comes up.  Curtis is a psychotherapist and when she tries her techniques on her daughter, it just makes the daughter angrier.  Curtis is a widow and her upcoming marriage is another source of annoyance to her daughter.  When mother and daughter are forced into situations which are totally out of their comfort zone (a rock concert for mom and a t.v. interview for the daughter) the movie becomes very funny.

1502179,5,B00005JMCW,"I love that there are quite a few good films for young girls to see. Movies with spunk. This one is no exception. It's fresh and funny, and brilliantly acted out. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan do amazing jobs pretending that they are one another, so much so that I actually began to believe that they had switched bodies.
Like many mother/daughter's, Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) argue. Anna thinks her mother is ruining her life. Tess thinks she is just watching out for her daughter. They go out for Chinese and a little old Chinese lady gives them each a fortune cookie, which is the catalyst for their switch. Will they ever get back to their own bodies? And more importantly, can they learn to respect one another?
Of course this movie is predictable, but that's not the point. It's sweet and a total blast to watch, not to mention laugh out loud funny.

Jamie Lee Curtis plays the mother named Tess Coleman, whom is a psychology doctor, and is too busy to understand what Anna wants or what Anna wants her mother to understand.
Once Anna and her mother are in each other's bodies, they learn to understand how it's like to be one another, and with that, they find love and respect in each other, and for a Disney movie, this one is sure to be a very funny and hilarious Disney film to watch for the whole family to enjoy!

In ""Freaky Friday,"" the relationship between daughter and mother, sister and brother, friends and friends or enemies are portrayed in the some how chaotic (and filled with detention)life of the main character. The clever banters and arguments are one of the facets that makes this movie as a acceptable entertainment.
For adults and teenagers, this movie might seem stupid for the storyline had been played by other movies as well. However, a part that  might grabs the attention of teenagers are the music played by the band, Pink Slip, of the main character. ""Ultimate"" and ""Take Me Away"" are two pretty good songs that make the movie a lot more lively.",1076025600,2,766,4.803030303030303

My husband even loved it. I bought the DVD and my daughters have seen it 5 times!!! Jamie Lee Curtis is great in her role. Lindsey Lohan is adorable in her role as she was in The Parent Trap.

I mean, it was about a teenage spoiled brat girl who constantly argued with her mom when she didn't get her way, so when they were argueing in a chinese resturant, they got magic forturne cookies that changed them into each other until they had self-less love for each other. Isn't that sweet. It is a Disney movie, remember that, but it really wasn't as bad as the plot makes it sound. When I went to see it I figured I could at least make fun of it if it was really bad, but I couldn't really do that because it wasn't as bad as I expected. There weren't any big special effects or anything like that, but it was fun. I wouldn't reccomend you run out and see it just because, but if you have nothing better to do, it can't really hurt, but make sure you've already seen Pirates of the Caribbean if you want to see a Disney movie.",1075248000,,890,4.1502890173410405
1502261,5,B00005JMCW,"Jamie Lee Curtis as Tess Coleman, and her daughter Anna, played by Lindsay Lohan, are wonderfully teamed as a hapless mother and daughter trapped in eachothers bodies after sharing a fortune cookie laced with oriental voodoo.
Although Anna and Tess are mother and daughter, they are not communicating and are too wrapped up in the selfishness of their own wants and needs.  Tess is getting married to new love Ryan, played by Mark Harmon, and Anna is wrapped up in her rock band, friends and boyfriend to be Jake (Chad Michael Murray).  She is also battling a vengeful Mr. Bates (Stephen Talblowsky)the sadistic English teacher, and Ex-Friend turned ""Insane Psycho Freak"" Stacy Hinckhouse. It is when Anna becomes Tess and Tess becomes Anna, that their two very different worlds, begin to make sense to them.  It is then that they both realize just how special each of them is to themselves, as well as to eachother.
The film is well paced, well done, with a killer soundtrack that keeps the mood lively and happy throughout.  All the characters are clearly drawn and fun to watch and root for.  As I always say, when you care about the characters, the movie has lived up to its budget.  You cannot wait to see Tess and Anna make it to the moment where they realize how to be selfless, the only way they can be switched back.  Meanwhile, it is wonderful when Tess as Anna is forced to ""Act like Keith"" at a very important performance for the band, while Anna as Tess unplugs her mom, and plays for her.  Tess gets to see the world through her daughters eyes and be young again, while Anna see life through eyes that look like the belong to ""The Crypt Keeper""!  All the while nobody except them know what is actually going on.  When do they finally unfreak? Watch and find out!

The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs.  Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout.

Anna cares only about herself and her social life and seeing her lighten up her mother's life is horrifying Trish does better as Anna but we dislike Anna already so she has a handicap. There is also an impossably bratty younger brother and a lame attempt at a romantic rivalry for anna's affections.

1502326,4,B00005JMCW,"The premise of ""Freaky Friday"" has been done before - a magic spell causes two characters to switch bodies and thus perspectives - but this film is a ton of fun anyway.  Psychiatrist Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) are constantly at war.  Tess is days away from remarrying, and Anna feels the acute pain of having lost her father.  Anna has found refuge in her music, but her mother fails to see the importance of it, pulling the plug (literally) on Anna's big break.  When a well-meaning Chinese woman ensures that they will be forced to understand each other's lives, the comedy begins full-force.  The two wake up trapped in the body (and the daily life) of the other.  The script is smart and punchy, with twists that are not as formulaic as the premise might suggest.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are hilarious in their interpretations of the generation gap.  While I expected such a performance from Curtis, Lohan was a wonderful surprise.  Without the chemistry and talent between these two actresses, the film could have been lackluster.  The other actors, most notably bland Mark Harmon, cannot sustain the energy Curtis and Lohan create.  With animated aplomb, they even manage to overcome a few missteps in the screenplay.
This film provides some hearty laughs and, in the tradition of such films, sentimental tears at the end.  It's a great film for both adolescents and parents, with jabs at both - and neither will be embarrassed by watching it with the other.",1073952000,,1519,4.822393822393822
1502327,5,B00005JMCW,"Mother and daughter Tess and Anna Coleman just don't get along.  Tess embarrasses teenage Anna to no end and is so busy planning a wedding she doesn't realize her daughter is growing up.  Anna resents the new man in the family and wants to be treated as a grown-up, even if she's not responsible enough yet.
Then one Friday, they wake up to discover they've been transported into each other's bodies.  Now Tess has to go to school and see what Anna's world is really like.  And Anna must act like a grown-up whether she wants to or not.  But can they figure out how to switch back before Tess walks down the aisle?
I actually have never seen the original or read the book, but as soon as I heard about this movie, I had to see it because of Lindsay Lohan.  I became an instant fan with her work in ""The Parent Trap"" remake, and this movie impressed me even more.  She made playing a grown-up trapped in a teen's body completely believable.  Jamie Lee Curtis is equally wonderful as a grown-up who really isn't.  The supporting cast is wonderful as they try to coup with the weirdness going on around them that they can't possibly understand.  I laughed the entire way through the movie and choked up with tears at the end.  (I cry at the drop of a hat, what can I say?)
The DVD is well worth buying.  Not only do you get the fun movie, but you get a few cool extras.  They have a deleted scene with director commentary (and he was right to delete it), and two alternative endings.  The bloopers reel was fun, as were the two music video's from the soundtrack.  There is a seven minute back stage featurette this is also worth checking out.  I would have loved to see an audio commentary or two, especially one including Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, but it's not to be found.  The movie itself is presented in both widescreen and full frame formats, with a wonderful picture.  The full surround sound is great as well.
Truly fun movies the entire family can enjoy together are a rare treat.  Jump on this one while you can.  Everyone will have an evening of pleasant entertainment.",1073865600,3,2087,4.399477806788512

1502417,3,B00005JMCW,"""Freaky Friday"" is a fun, high-spirited remake of the 1976 film of the same name, which served as ground zero for the body-switch movie craze of the 1980's.
Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Loman are terrific as the mother and daughter who don't see eye-to-eye on too many things, least of all how the other should be living her life.  But when a freak ""accident"" befalls them, causing each of them to wind up in the other's body, both are forced to see things from the other person's perspective.  This sort of one-joke setup could easily have resulted in a mechanical, manufactured comedy, but writers Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon, along with director Mark Waters, have decided to have some real fun with the premise by devising clever scenarios that bend the mind a little and by building a surprising amount of depth into the two lead characters.  We learn quite a bit about how each generation views the other in the course of all the highflying antics.
This film is a real tour de force for the two actresses, especially Curtis, who never falters for a moment in her characterization of a bratty teenager trapped in a middle-aged woman's body.  Loman has the less challenging - and less fun - job of portraying her opposite number, but she still delivers a performance of tremendous charm and substance.
""Freaky Friday"" may not be original, but it provides more laugh-out-loud moments than virtually any comedy released in 2003.",1073433600,,1431,4.781376518218623
1502418,4,B00005JMCW,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatures.  In fact, I saw it more than once I enjoyed it so much. I even bought the music CD right after I saw the movie.
The performances by both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are multilayered, the support cast is superb and the characters are written so that the actors have substance to build their own characterizations.  Exceedingly rich exchange of emotions as the two actresses ""make the switch""... I found myself loving BOTH of them and completely believing their performances from start to finish.
Mark Harmon plays ""The Almost-Step-Dad"" role perfectly as well: very realistic and human, not sappy at all.
If you are purchasing the DVD strictly for the movie, by all means.... Do so and love the movie.  I was disappointed in the bonuses, however.  When I enjoy a movie this much, especially because my children and I could enjoy it equally, I really look forward to the bonuses.  They were, in my estimation, worthy of about a two star rating.
Get the CD and watch the movie itself.  Briefly check out the Bonuses and see if you make them to be worth more than two stars.",1073433600,,1127,4.554455445544554
1502419,1,B00005JMCW,"Avoid at all costs!  Don't let your lass drag you to this steaming pile of sentimental manure.  When most sequels are waste of time why didn't the alarm bells ring when a remake of a Disney film, adapted from a book aimed at prissy teenage girls was slated for production.
Don't be fooled!  This is the sort of waste of time that may lure you into thinking that it's worth seeing by chucking one of three good laughs from the middle 30 minutes of comedy in a short trailer.  Secondly, you may actually find the feminising effects take a hold as you sit hand in hand with your girl and begin to enjoy the `emotional journey' of the characters on the screen.
What's the cure?  If you are dragged into this Freaky sweet world you have three options.  A: Find a new girlfriend.  B: Request that your girl watches one of `your' films in exchange.

1502422,5,B00005JMCW,"I am generally apprehensive regarding remakes because they are often inferior to the original.  I avoided this movie in the theaters for that reason.  Eventually we got the DVD and I gritted my teeth to watch.  To my surprise the remake covers new territory in switch films and was quite enjoyable.
As with the original, the interplay is between mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell Coleman (Lindsay Lohan).  However, in the original the daughter, played by Jodi Foster, was the stronger of the two roles and the mother just didn't quite spark my interest after the switch.  In this movie both characters play well and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once again what a great actress she is.
The best part of the movie is that the update is very modern.  Annabell is faced with motorcycle riding hunks, is a member of a hard rock group, and wants to get more piercings.  The character of Annabell is wonderfully rebellious yet not completely out of control.
As with most teens, Annabell and her mother are arguing about something constantly.  With a bit of Asian magic, and a rather tricky fortune cookie, mother and daughter switch bodies.  The switch itself is hilarious.  One of the scenes played in advertisements continuously is when Annabell, now in Tess' body, says that she's the Crypt Keeper.  Jamie Lee Curtis is perfectly believable after the transition.
We soon find that each really struggles with the other's world.  Annabell can't keep up with all her mother's cell phones, PDA, and beeper.  Further, driving seems to be quite a challenge for her.  Tess discovers that her daughter was telling the truth about the English teacher who is continually out to get her, regardless of how well she does.  It turns out that the English teacher and Tess know each other.  Tess solves Annabell's problem quite nicely.  However, Tess still has other problems, particularly with Annabell's friends.  The peak of Tess' problems are during a rock audition that is very important to Annabell.
There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice.  Tess is preparing to get married to Ryan (Mark Harmon), who is trying to understand his soon to be daughter but, as with many fathers, is more than a little clueless.  Annabell also has a younger brother that she sees as a pest.  The switch allows candid conversations between Annabell and Ryan and Annabell and younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) where Annabell learns that Ryan doesn't want to upset her life and truly wants to understand her and Harry loves her and admires her.  The poignant moments are handled quite well with minimal schmaltz.
The true point of the movie is for each to walk in the other's shoes.  In the process of doing so we get to see some well done physical and situational comedy, most particularly by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Both Tess and Annabell are both empathetic characters.  While the focus is on the ladies, making this a mother-daughter film, males will enjoy the generational myopia of mother and daughter.  A wonderful family film that I consider suitable for most family members.",1073260800,,3087,4.877159309021113

The acting in this movie is top notch.  The role reversal is done so exceptionally well, that I was 100% convinced Jamie Lee Curtis had morphed into Lindsay Lohen's body, and vice versa.  Besides the great acting, the story was fun, not really any really dull parts.  It was funny, heartwarming, and was a very entertaining movie for the whole family.

1502465,5,B00005JMCW,"FREAKY FRIDAY is a movie of revelations.  First, we have the breakout performance for an actress who has always done well, but in this movie, well she finds her niche.  Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely delightful in the role of Tess Coleman.  She brings a comic ability hardly evidenced in her earlier films; she also has the maturity to cut loose and play her teenage daughter with all the stops pulled out.  If this was a perfect world, Jamie Lee would find herself with a Best Actress oscar nomination this year.  Likewise, Ms. Lindsay Lohan---incredible performance, going from the self-centered teenybopper to the more sophisticated and mature personage of her stressed out mom.
Lohan and Curtis work brilliantly together, and in this same perfect world, Lindsay would also be Oscar nominated.
Director Mark Waters kept things moving at a frenetic pace, and had me chuckling throughout the movie.  We can't overlook, either, the wonderful actors in their supporting roles:  Mark Harmon was his usual stuffy self, but there was innate warmth lurking there, too; Harold Gould was charming as the hard of hearing grandfather; Ryan Malgarini was perfect as the brother from hell; Dina Spybey was perfect as the too perfect classmate, Stacey; and my favorites:  Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong as the Chinese ladies who get the ball rolling with the switching.  They are so full of life, they give the movie incredible bursts of fun and humor.  Ironically, Chad Michael Murray worked best in his scenes with Jamie Lee; he seemed to have more maturity and self-confidence.
This is a very entertaining movie, and in its own way, much better than the original.

1502467,4,B00005JMCW,"I honestly enjoyed the new version of Freaky Friday.  The original was a classic from my childhood, but the remake is a more then suitable replacement.
The storyline is simple and predictable as a typically self-absorbed teenage girl and her overworked mother switch places to see how the other half lives.  This is thanks to a magic fortune cookie delivered by an elderly Chinese woman who was just trying to help them.  Unfortunately this switch occurs two days before the mother's wedding and the day before her daughter has a major honors test at school.  From the minute this occurs, we know that each character will mature before the end of the show and will help the other in a way they didn't think was possible.  It does happen, but it was sure fun to watch.
This is a great movie if you're looking to simply let your mind guy and be entertained.  It succeeds and the lead roles are perfectly acted to make us care what the outcome will be.

Jamie is great at this (""Oh my god, she's BLIND!""), and Lindsey does pretty well too, especially considdering she's a beginner to acting.

1502471,3,B00005JMCW,"Walt Disney has been searching the vaults in order to find suitable family fare for years. This version of Freaky Friday is an updated remake of their own 1977 film.
On its face this is the classic body switch movie featuring a harried mother and her rebellious teenage daughter (at least by Disney standards). The roles here are played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan. It is the portrayals that make this film. Both principles do a surprisingly good job with the material that they are given.
This is by no means a bad film. Actually it has some funny moments. Not Academy Award good but acceptable for both children and adults. Disney seems to be banking on the power of its stars to carry the film and for the most part it succeeds.
The DVD presents the film in both full and widescreen versions with a 5.1 Dolby soundtrack. If there is a flaw with the disc it is in the area of bonus materials but Disney  was probably thinking that its taget audience would not really be interested in these materials anyway.
Get this film for its family oriented nature you may be surprised to find yourself chuckling along.",1072828800,,1119,4.53960396039604
1502472,3,B00005JMCW,"This remake of the Barbara Harris/Jodie Foster film from the mid-1970s is a borderline 4-star picture. It's a classy, smart and very, VERY funny family film, one that does not insult grownups while it's tickling the kiddos. I don't own this one yet (my daughter does), but I have no doubt I'll be adding it to the family section of my DVD library.
What's best about the movie is its acting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are sensational; did any two actors give better performances in the summer of 2003? I always knew Curtis could play funny/tough/matronly/goofy, but Lohan pretty much comes out of nowhere to deliver what is, I think, a Best Supporting Actress-level performance.
Lohan, if you will recall, played the twins in the 1998 remake of ""The Parent Trap"" (another great family film -- strangely absent from DVD). She was wonderful there, but here she's sort of breathtaking. She plays both the mother and the daughter (she and Curtis switch bodies thanks to an Asian ""curse"") with absolute conviction. I have a feeling we're watching the rise of a major talent. Who knows what this young actress will be doing 10 years from now? On the basis of her work in these Disney films, I'd say great stuff!
Otherwise, ""Freaky Friday"" is a whole lot of fun. I can't imagine someone not enjoying this movie. It's pure entertainment, but it also deals sort of touchingly with the themes of remarriage and frustrated adolescence. Though it focuses on a mother-daughter relationship, the movie is really for everyone -- even fathers and daughters, as I found out.",1072742400,3,1565,4.821561338289963
1502558,5,B00005JMCW,"Freaky Friday is a great movie. I got this movie for Christmas and watched it with my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and my little brother. There were ages from 10 all the way to about 50 something years old. Everyone loved this movie and were laughing none stop.

 I would recommend this movie to anybody. All ages will love this movie. Freaky friday is also a good family movie and it shows adults that teenagers lives aren't really as easy as they might think, and shows us teenagers that being an adult isn't as easy as we might think either!

 Freaky Friday is a 5 star movie without a doubt, so what are you waiting for if you haven't seen it yet you should! This is like one of the best family movies that has come out in a long time. Which says a lot!",1072742400,,761,4.227586206896552
1502559,3,B00005JMCW,"Neo who? 2003 was expected to be the year of The Matrix but has surprisingly become the year of The Mouse. The Walt Disney Company, who last summer was groveling over constant movie problems, has surpassed all other studios by becoming the first to cross the coveted $1 billion mark this year thanks in part to the leggy duo of Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Disney hopes to continue its winning streak by digging through their archives and remaking a classic film for a new generation. Freaky Friday, which originally starred Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster back in 1977, hopes to join the ranks of other girl oriented Disney comedies like The Princess Diaries and The Parent Trap, which also starred Lindsay Lohan. The only thing going against the film is the fact that it is a remake. Walt Disney Pictures does not have a great success rate for their remakes with films like Flubber and That Darn Cat flopping at the box office. And things didn't go too well for the original Freaky Friday back when it first opened in 1977. The good word on the film didn't get around until late in its run and by then it was all too late. Freaky Friday hopes to defy past history and present a delightful film for teenage girls; a thing the box office has lacked a lot this year. But will the girls flock to the film or will history repeat itself?
The story centers on the conflicting relationship between Dr. Tess Coleman and her daughter, Anna. Anna is just another typical fifteen year old teenager who enjoys rock music, plays in a garage band, and drives her mother crazy over her hair, clothes, and problems at school. Tess has enough to worry about with her rising career and her upcoming wedding. But one night while the whole family is dining at a Chinese restaurant things boil over. Anna is totally infuriated that her mother doesn't agree with her musical aspirations and Tess is at wits end trying to get Anna to recognize how good of a man her future husband is. When the two crack open their fortune cookies and read the pieces of paper inside, something mysterious happens the next morning. Anna wakes up in Tess' body and Tess wakes up in Anna's body. The two live each other's lives for one day going through all the problems they never imagined the other had as they try to find a solution to their predicament. Whatever has to be done must be done quickly as Tess is set to marry her boyfriend the next day! The story for Freaky Friday does a great job at modernizing the classic body switching tale for a new generation though several elements of the new script end up getting lost within the course of the two hour feature. The conflict between Anna's former friend who is now a cheerleader was just another typical ""Cheerleaders are evil"" story element most teen comedies and/or dramas seem to have but wasn't really necessary for this film.
The cast for the remake of Freaky Friday was surprisingly more memorable then that of the original film. Jamie Lee Curtis, who is best known for her roles in True Lies and the Halloween series, is absolutely amazing as Tess Coleman. She plays the frantic mother role down pat and slips very well into the role of a teenage girl trapped in a grown woman's body. Lindsay Lohan, who also starred another Disney remake, The Parent Trap, does a very good job in the role of Anna Coleman and shows that she is really maturing in her style of acting. The scenes where Tess is in the body of Anna are less comedic then the scenes with Jamie Lee Curtis acting like a teenager but maybe the fact the audience knows its Jamie Lee Curtis makes it that way. Mark Harmon is pretty good as Tess' future husband but he isn't featured as much as he should have been. His character is shown struggling trying to connect with Anna in only a scene or two and doesn't show much conflict as more there was more of a focus on the relationship between Tess and Anna. Chad Murrary plays another typical high school guy who looks bad but is actually good at heart that is seen in every other teen comedy/drama and does nothing outside the ordinary here.
Overall, Freaky Friday is another teen oriented comedy which can be both good and bad. Most of the problems with the film seem to be that many of the elements that are typical in a teen comedy/drama are no different here. Such elements as ""cheerleaders are evil"", ""the bad boy is good at heart"" and ""some teachers are out to get certain children"" got pretty annoying after awhile and weren't needed is this feature. Then there were the scenes that show Jake (Chad Murray) becoming fascinated with Anna's mother. Granted they were trying to show that Jake was interested in Anna's mind and personality that was trapped in Tess' body but it still comes out as just creepy and wrong especially when he sings ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" outside their house. And as hilarious as the film was in many instances, the overall feeling was that the film resorted to too much slap stick humor. Certainly the film didn't have to lower itself to that level that much to be entertaining. Outside of those problems, the film was quite entertaining though not on the same level as comedies like Anger Management, Bruce Almighty, and American Wedding. If you are a teenage girl searching for an entertaining film outside of the ""blow `em up"" action flicks the box office seems to be cluttered with then certainly Freaky Friday is the film for you. If not, stick with Pirates of the Caribbean or American Wedding until the next gross out comedy or action flick opens in a few weeks. ",1072656000,3,5588,4.560199004975124
1502560,4,B00005JMCW,"""Freaky Friday"", a remake of a 1976 film starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, was on my list of movies to avoid when it came out in the summer of 2003 - too cute, too predictable, too formula, etc. As it turns out, though, it's rather good and often quite funny, thanks in large part to Jamie Lee Curtis' over-the-top performance and to Mark L. Waters' fairly sophisticated direction. Its target audience is girls aged ten to sixteen, but it is a movie adults can also enjoy.
This is the story of Tess [Curtis] and her teen daughter, Annabell [Lindsay Lohman]. Tess is about to remarry and Annabell is in the rebellious stage. The tension between the two, as well as between Annabell and her kid brother, seems rather typical. One night at a Chinese restaurant an old woman casts a spell on mother and daughter. The next morning each wakes up in the other's body. They spend a `freaky' - and hilarious - Friday, each experiencing what life is like for the other. Tess has to go to Annabell's high school, and Annabell must go off to her mother's office. Each must put up with the other one's boy friend. Kid brother, of course, doesn't know which end is up.
Like most movies of its type, ""Freaky Friday"" sometimes runs perilously close to the schmaltzy and the sentimental, but each time it does, a funny line or physical action pulls it back from the edge. Again, much of this is due to Ms. Curtis, who is one of our funniest, cleverest, and most underrated actresses. I doubt we'll be seeing her name on Oscar's list of Best Actress nominees, and that's a pity. She is one classy actress.",1072569600,5,1595,4.522491349480969

The movie was very realistic (until they switched places). I know this, because I'm also a teenager, and I kinda act like Anna too (and I completely understand her!).
I thought the Freaky Friday was very funny, too. When I was watching it the time just flew by.
I'd tell about one of my favorite parts in it, but there are just to many.
In conclution, the movie is very enjoyable, for the whole family (and the acting is great, too)!",1072569600,,553,4.177570093457944
1502563,4,B00005JMCW,"This is the third adaption of the ""Freaky Friday"" book by author Mary Rogers. The first with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris in 1977, and the second was a TV movie in the mid 90's with Shelley Long. This new adaption, I have to say, blows the other two out of the water. I went into this film knowing that it will probably be a nice little movie(which it is)and will probably think nothing more of it while and after I watched it. I am happy to say that I am wrong in that case. This Disney released film is a joy and a delight from the first frame to the very last. I credit the screenwriters and director Mark Waters for delivering a breezy, witty, lighthearted, lift me up romp that is sure to please and satisfy everyone looking for a nice family for everyone to watch. The film is about The Coleman family. Mom is Tess Coleman(Jamie Lee Curtis), a widowed psychiatrist trying to maintain a job, a home, and raising her two kids. Son Harry, and her 15 year old daughter Anna(Lindsay Lohan). What we soon come to learn is what we have already expected. Mom and daughter not getting along for all the usual reasons. It's the constant battle between young and adult, kids and parents. Anna is a rebel type who is in a rock band that plays in the garage, gets into trouble at school, and feels like everyone is against her. Mom Tess is just trying to keep things together after their father passed away 3 three years before. Tess is engaged to nice guy Ryan(Mark Harmon), and the wedding is in 2 days or so. After a dinner at a chinese restaraunt where Tess and Anna get into a fight, a chinese woman gives them a magical fortune cookie that makes the two change bodies. They wake up the next morning in each other's body's, and the fun really begins. Each try to be the other - Anna, in Tess' body, tries to do her mom's job and to keep up appearances with Ryan. Tess, in Anna's body, tries to go to school in Anna's place. Each learns a lesson while being each other and it's a lesson we have come to all know. It's not easy being a teenaged girl when you are going through changes, falling for boys for the first time, and thinking that nobody, especially your parents, don't understand you. And it's not easy being a single parent with a teenaged girl having to deal with her issues as well as your own and caring for the well being of your family and keeping the house standing. It's something we have seen countless times in movies and TV shows, but it really works here. The main reason for that are because of the wonderful performances by Jamie Lee and Lindsay. I have always been a fan of Jamie Lee's, but even more so now. She delivers a great performance that gets to showcase how good she is at comedy and at physical comedy. She has the moody,snotty teenager thing down pat. You can tell she is having a blast doing it, and it comes thru in the performance and enhances it even more. The performance from young Lohan is equally engaging. She was much better when she was acting as her mom than she was when she was herself. Playing her mom, she had a real knack for giving out a parental demeanor and it was strong and even endearing in some of her actions and mannerisms. The success and every winning aspect of this film is because of these two actresses. Mark Harmon has a pretty typical role, but it's nice to see him in a movie again. Chad Michael Murray, who is quickly becoming the new heartthrob for young girls around the world thanks to this movie and his series ""One Tree Hill"", is Jake. The token ""potential boyfriend"" that gets into the mix. Like Harmon, it's a pretty by the numbers type of character, but he does what he does. While it is so easy to dismiss a film like this for being light and fluffy, this one has better odds of making a longer impact than others because of it's sweetness and because of the appealing performances from Curtis and Lohan. I enjoyed this film a lot and it is just about as perfect as a nice family film can possibly be. Nothing more, nothing less.",1072483200,,4010,4.3337765957446805

1502565,4,B00005JMCW,"My original fear of this movie was that Jamie Lee Curtis would play an incredibly stupid older woman when she switched identities with her daughter.  Worried that she would just act silly and do really stupid things, I was at first skeptical abou this title.  It's also a classic with the great Jodie Foster, and those classic Disney movies are tough to remake.  However, if you watch the old version, the mom, in her daughter's mind, makes her daughter seem like a stupid teenager, and it just gets annoying.  I was surprised that Jamie Lee Curtis was able to pull off acting like a teenager while still being able to hold some credibility.  For the one thing that would have gone terribly wrong is if she portrayed the teenage mind as silly, ignorant, and downright spacey.  Her performance keeps the fantasy aspects of the movie at bay with the reality of the real issues.  It's not an Oscar-worthy, cutting-edge film, but it's really fun to watch and a great remake.",1072137600,3,970,4.670588235294118
1502566,4,B00005JMCW,"Remakes, like song covers, are iffy prospects because they rarely come close to approaching to the majesty of the original.  Disney succeeds with it's ""Freaky Friday"" remake because it doesn't fight the story, but merely updates it with contemporary actors and themes.  Lindsay Lohan is the best actress to come out of Disney in years, and is always a joy to watch for her unflinching honesty and willingness to take the viewers on an emotional journey.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the ""Cher"" of motion pictures; people always forget how wonderful she is until she comes barreling back with another fantastic performance.  Both actresses have incredible comic flair and a true sense of physical comedy, as well as a chemistry that completely renders their mother-daughter relationship plausible.
In terms of story, ""Freaky Friday"" manages to incorporate contemporary themes like parental death, working parents, remarriage, blended families, teenage angst over love and school, and the like, without seeming preachy or offering any trite solutions.  Both mother and daughter learn the only way to heal their fractured relationship is to talk honestly with one another.  None of the plot lines or messages are rushed or underdeveloped, but presented simply without melodrama.  Thus the movie is accessible to children of all ages, respectful of teenagers and the problems they encounter, and is a nice diversion for adults and parents who are afraid to suffer through another ""kiddie"" movie.
This movie was very well done, with good acting and sequence, a better-than-average plot, and a catchy soundtrack.  Enjoyable for all ages and highly recommended for not catering to the expected.",1072137600,,1679,5.309433962264151

1502665,5,B00005JMCW,"""Freaky Friday"" stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Chad Michael Murray, and others.  This is one the funniest comedies released in 2003.  This remake of the 1976 version, starring Jodie Foster, lives up to the original.  The writers update the events very well, while adding new and original elements.  The laughs begin before Tess(Curtis) and Anna(Lohan) switch bodies because of a fortune cookie.  However, the laughs become more frequent in their struggle to get their bodies back.  Such hilarious scenes will be unforgettable to audiences.  Jamie Lee Curtis's Golden Globe nominated role(Best Actress in a Comedy Film) is one of her best in her 25-year acting career.  She, like all the other actors, adds her own sense of humor into the movie, offering audiences more viewing pleasure.  This film may not have been so magical if it wasn't for her.  Lindsay Lohan proves in her role that she'll be a big name actress in the near future.  ""Freaky Friday"" is a great movie for those looking for a great comedy.

1502666,5,B00005JMCW,"Let me just start by saying that Disney's remake of ""Freaky Friday"" is a lot of fun.  I enjoyed watching this umpteenth hundred take on the ""parent-child-switch-body-because-you-don't-understand-my-life-at-all"" concept.  What makes this film really work is the very impressive performances.  I will start with Lindsay Lohan, who I think convincingly embodies the parent role (the scene that shows her admonishing her ""friends,"" while also pulling down the blouse of one of the girls is hilarious!) while also expressing the angst of a young girl quite well.
But the real joy and surprise of this film is the incredible performance of Jamie Lee Curtis. I wholeheartedly agree with the many critics who are saying that this work deserves consideration  by the Academy.  This is a performance worthy of at least an Oscar nod!!  Hold your lunch and your complaints skeptics and naysayers for just a second.  So often we equate good performances with dramatic scenes and histrionics.  Comedy is difficult--as many an actor has said, and physical comedy is even more difficult.  Curtis pulls this off with style, grace and comedic elan.  I truly believed she was a teenager!  As an example, watch the scene with Chad Michael Murray at the diner/hangout when they are discussing music--watch Curtis' body language.  This is good work people!!  I hope the Academy sees the value of this work just as they did Tom Hanks' in ""Big.""
She truly deserves to be among the five nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.  The five stars I rate this film are chiefly a result of Curtis' superb work.

1502670,4,B00005JMCW,"The teenage years are hard. Countless films have been made about that era in every person's life, including this year's controversial ""13."" And the biggest surprise may be the way Disney handles the subject in ""Freaky Friday,"" not toning down premises as they have before, but rather allowing all to flow freely and still making it a clean, moralistic family film.
Oh, and adulthood is hard, too.
""Freaky Friday"" was originally released in 1976. The film starred Jodie Foster, and was never exactly the Disney family classic it meant to be (obviously copying ""The Parent Trap's"" style). It spawned a lot of copies, including a made-for-TV remake in 1995 with Shelley Long, not to mention a string of late-80s films, such as ""Like Father, Like Son""; ""18 Again""; and ""Vice Versa."" All were different variations on the basic premise of adults switching places with their offspring or younger relations, and the two then coming to appreciate their differences.
Now the formula is seeing a steady increase in popularity once again. 2002's ""The Hot Chick"" (one of the worst of that year) was about a teenage girl who swapped places with a petty criminal. Now Disney is cashing in on something they made some 20 odd years ago, and no one -- myself included -- expected the film to be any good. Surprise, surprise.
Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a widowed psychiatrist with two kids, including Anna (Lindsay Lohan), a 15-year-old highschooler with aspirations of punk rock status -- she and her friends get together in the garage of her house and ""jam."" (I play guitar and, for the first time since ""Back to the Future,"" it looks as if the filmmakers put some effort to make the guitar players look like they are really playing the darn thing).
""You're ruining my life!"" Anna constantly yells. Tess' engaged boyfriend, Ryan (Mark Harmon), isn't sure what's going on between the two, but his attempts at being nice to the kids often backfires. (After Tess removes Anna's bedroom door due to low grades, Harmon tells Anna that it's under the staircase in an effort to make peace with her. ""Like I didn't figure that out already,"" she says.)
When mother and daughter visit a Chinese restaurant and eat some magical fortune cookies, they wake up the next day as always -- expect they're in each other's bodies.
And so here come the jokes. One bets that they can make it in school, the other at work. Tess, in Anna's body, acts like a mature adult. Meanwhile, Anna, in Tess' body, acts like a teenager -- she even gets a makeover.
But there're problems. There's a wedding and a rock band audition, and since they're in each other's bodies, it presents a major dilemma. But if they want to switch back before their big days, then they'll have to learn to appreciate each other's differences.
What a delightful little family film this is! Sweet, gentle, funny, and just plain enjoyable. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, and in the process becomes a lot more. It has streaks of ""Big"" and ""Vice Versa."" I've always enjoyed ""Vice Versa"" the most out of the many, many body-switching 80s films released simultaneously, and now I've found another worthy addition to the genre.
Annette Bening was originally cast as Tess Coleman, but then Jamie Lee Curtis stepped in. And I'm glad she did. I'm not a very big fan of Curtis, but she can occasionally be quite surprising, and this is one of those cases. Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan, the little girl from 1998's remake of ""The Parent Trap,"" evokes the same great method of adult channeling as little Fred Savage did in ""Vice Versa."" As many of my readers probably know, my main problem with ""Big"" is that Tom Hanks did not act like a 13-year-old, but rather like a 6-year-old. Lohan successfully acts like both an irritating teenager and a mature adult. The two gals' performances really make the movie.
This is one of the most enjoyable treats of the year. Kids will get a kick out of it, and so will parents, and that is precisely the definition of great family filmmaking -- because, let's face it, Disney lost sight of that a few years ago. Looks like they're finally getting back on their feet after a long dry spot.",1071878400,3,4155,4.7166437414030264

Yes, the theme is a slightly 70s doozie: body switching. But don't let that fool you into skipping this (as it did me) because the direction is sharp, not heavy handed. No special effects, great writing, crisp dialogue, just a plain fun movie, like the studios cranked out for decades, before they became what they are today. Curtis as usual is simply charming, she IS every bit the mother/daughter, and Linsday Lohan has a great presence.

It works well. I liked the psychical work from the characters. Curtis, from the body of the teenager, dresses hip in order to in with the crowd and the daughter's crush is falling for her! Curtis and the young actress Linsay Lohan give heartwarming performances and make the believibility of a real life mother and daughter seem real. The only slight negative thing about this film is the subplot of the fortune cookie being the basis of the mom and daughter's switch. Otherwise the film is a standout.",1071187200,5,1052,4.513089005235602

at the beginning, you learn that jamie is getting married, and lindsey is having trouble at school.  jamie keeps getting put down by her daughter because lindsey doesnt believe jamie understands her life.  a funny twist has them switch in a chinese restaurant.  i won't tell you how they react and what happens but trust me- this movie is SO funny",1070928000,3,600,4.418181818181818
1502750,5,B00005JMCW,"Wow!  We loved this movie.  This actually happened to us once, but that jolt thing worked so we didn't have to learn any life lessons from the ordeal.  But seriously folks, this movie was absolutely one of our favorites.  We laughted, we cried, life doesn't get much better than that!  The soundtrack is also way cool.
We also really like the Cheetah Girls and that soundtrack.  I think we've seen it every time it's been on the Disney Channel.  I hope we don't start watching Freaky Friday while the Cheetah Girls is on.  Horror!",1070928000,,530,4.5638297872340425

I fight with my mom all of the time, and see hates the way a dress. It isn't bad, but she says it is not her tasted.

1502752,4,B00005JMCW,"I had been looking forward to seeing this for months. I love Jamie Lee Curtis and was excited to hear that she was playing the role of the mother in thsi film loosely based on the 70's original with Jodie Foster. The film starts off slow, but gets better fast with plenty of funny moments and excellent acting from the cast. They're very believable.
The plot is based around a mother who is about to get married and her rebellious, punk-ish daughter who happen to switch places thanks to an Asian curse placed on them. They then discover that each others lives wasn't as easy as I thought. Great modern re-make. Funny, but not at all vulgar. Great for any age.",1070323200,,660,4.462809917355372

They live a day in eachother's shoes, literally, and see how hard it is to get by.  It is a non-stop laughter kind of movie, and if you love funny, you'll love this movie!",1069459200,,478,4.564705882352941
