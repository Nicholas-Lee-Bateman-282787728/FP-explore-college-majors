422826,5,6302109612,"The unlikely has happened; it appears there is more than one Michael Corben. One an agent for the CIA the other a French student (Richard Grieco) on class assignment to France. Is it possible that they can get their personalities crossed? And when the student is offered a fancy car to drive do you expect the confusion to be cleared? ""I'm Michael Corben ---deep cover agent for the CIA""

All is going well; he gets to lead a 007 life with money, cars, and girls. Then reality sets in Michael and The French Teacher (Robin Bartlett) must team up to save Europe form a dastardly plan of the evil Steranko (Roger Rees) and his henchwoman (Linda Hunt.)

Will he succeed or is Europe doomed?",1503187200,,687,4.532258064516129

422859,5,6302109612,"It's one of the best Bond clone films out there, if not the best (at least of this Bond era). I'd even wager it's better than several (if not all) of the 80s Bond adventures (shots fired!). It's self-aware of what it is and doesn't try to navigate over to serious action territory (think of GYMKATA); nope, it cashes in where it knows its talents lie, and it benefits immensely from that.

A high school-aged Grieco mistaken for a spy en route to France that gets embroiled in a nefarious plot for world domination? Yeah, it reads dumb, but it's a lean and speedy film with a hell of a lot of heart.

I still maintain that our two lead villains, Steranko and Grunt, make for one of the best baddie duos in any action movie. They're layered, sophisticated, and not as formulaic as you'd expect.

I'm not saying you're about to watch pure cinema art, but you're in for a treat that makes no bones about what it is and delivers on all fronts.",1486598400,,939,4.354285714285714

423045,4,6302109612,"In the European nation of Orenbourg, the wealthy Augustus Steranko is in the middle of a shady deal with France's finance minister to acquire gold. When the Frenchman attempts to back out, Steranko promptly has him killed. Suddenly Britain's top secret agent Blade assaults Steranko's mansion, fighting his way through his guards, only to be felled by Steranko's diminutive right-hand woman Ilsa Grunt and her deadly whip.

With Blade dead, the bigwigs over at MI6 need a replacement agent and fast. To this end, they enlist the aid of the CIA, who agree to loan them their best agent, one Michael Corben. A traitor in MI6 informs Ilsa of Agent Corben's impending arrival, and she leaves for America.

In America, a different Michael Corben, a high school student, has a problem. Graduation has come up, but since he cut his French classes to go partying all year long, he doesn't have enough credits to pass; and at Edsel High, if you don't pass your foreign language class, you don't graduate. Fortunately, though, French teacher Mrs. Grober is going to give him one last chance. The French class is going on a field trip to France in the summer, and is Michael accompanies them, he'll be allowed to pass.

So it is that a mixup occurs at the airport. Ilsa waylays and murders Michael Corben the CIA agent, whilst the identically-named Michael Corben the high school student unwittingly takes the dead spy's place on board the plane bound for France. He gets to sit in first class, much to Mrs. Grober's annoyance. Upon arriving in France, Michael is shanghaied by a British agent named Richardson and whisked away to a top-secret lab, despite his protests that he isn't the Michael Corben the British think he is. His protests end abruptly when he's shown the cool, gadget-laden red Lotus sports car he'll get to drive, and he decides he'll play along with the spy gig for a while if it means he gets to play with gadgets and avoid his fussy teacher.

Meanwhile, Ilsa, thinking she murdered a decoy, assigns Zigesfeld, an assassin with a golden robotic hand, to follow and kill the ""real"" Agent Corben. Also tailing Michael is a mysterious woman with some connection to the murdered Blade. Additionally, Mrs. Grober's noisy search for her missing student has MI6 thinking she is an assassin out to kill Michael; likewise, Steranko thinks she's working for MI6. Both groups set out to have her and her class eliminated, and when they end up captured by Zigesfeld and taken to Steranko's mansion, it's up to Michael and the mysterious woman to rescue them and stop Steranko's evil plans.

Written by The Monster Squad director Fred Dekker, If Looks Could Kill is a love letter to the over-the-top action films of the 60's and 70's. Unfortunately, it's a disjointed movie, tonally. On the one hand, it's too simplistic and juvenile for adults... but at the same time it's too complicated and violent for kids. It's definitely a film that failed to find an audience. Also, despite supposedly being a spoof (it tends to get categorized as a comedy), its content is played dead serious a lot of the time, especially towards the end.

This was supposed to be Richard Grieco's big break, but, alas, the movie underperformed and he never quite made it. The really great performances, though, are the villains. Roger Rees is a bit hard to swallow as the hammy Steranko, while Linda Hunt, who projects subtle, quiet menace as Ilsa, and Canadian actor Tom Rack, who has only one line in the entire film, and acts primarily with his eyes and mannerisms, and in so doing conveys barely-suppressed homicidal mania. He's definitely one of cinema's scarier henchmen characters.

The action sequences are hit and miss. Blade's assault on Steranko's mansion at the beginning is neat, but is over too quickly and poorly edited. The car chase in France is slow-moving and kind of uninteresting despite the soundtrack trying to convince us otherwise. This leaves the climax, involving a shootout with hordes of henchmen who can't aim (of course), a fistfight with Zigesfeld, and finally an attempted escape by Steranko which ends in one of the most hilariously awful helicopter crashes ever put to film. If the first half disappoints when it comes to action, then the finale definitely delivers.",1364342400,,4276,4.865384615384615

He's surprisingly good as the High School jock who thinks he's too cool for school literally when he gets a chance to be a spy.  Little does he know with Villians like Roger Rees and Linda Hunt (with a wonderful gadget of her own and having a marvelous time pushing mini-villiany to new heights) taking his measure and meting out appropriate steps to remove him from the game he may not last long. There's plenty of him on display here (in his briefs) as he encounters his own Bond girl trying to convince him her sign is scorpio in the bedroom.  Meanwhile he just wanted an extra French credit to get his High School Diploma which puts him at odds during his mission with one of the the screens greatest spy operatives ""The French Teacher""!

This is still I think the best Bond parody movie I've seen - given how much else that has come out on DVD over the years I'm still amazed that this isn't available anywhere in the DVD format.  If you run across an old tape (and still have a VHS player) its worth popping this in it for a watch.  Don't take this serious and you'll enjoy yourself and if you've sat through a lot of genuine James Bond movies over the years then you'll probably really appreciate the riffs in this movie better - and wonder how you'd cope with Corbin's car if you ever ended up with one :)",1213142400,4,846,4.115151515151515

423108,5,6302109612,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time!  Although this was released in cinemas in 1991, poor marketing by Warner Bros meant it never achieved the success it should have on the big screen or even once released to video for that matter.  Word of mouth however in subsequent years turned this film into a cult classic. I know my copy certainly did the rounds of the houses of pretty much every other kid I knew in the early 90s. Unfortunately for the film none of the actors in it have gone on to become megastars, although you will certainly see a fair few of them in a vast number of films and supporting roles on TV shows.

So what's this great film about?  Well basically it is a very well done teen parody of secret agent type films such as James Bond. Basically the CIA's top secret agent is killed by the minion Ilsa Grunt (played by Linda Hunt most famous as the principal in Kindergarten Cop) of the evil want to be ruler of Europe, supervillain Augustus Steranko (played by Roger Rees).  With his plans about to come into fruition, and a fear he may know all their current agents identities, there's no time for a new CIA agent to be trained.  Luckily there has been an agent deep undercover in the USA under the code name, Michael Corben.  Unfortunately for the CIA, Steranko knows about him and Grunt is sent to dispose of him before he gets on the plane.  Fortunately for the world though, Michael Corben (played by Richard Grienco best known for his former role as Officer Dennis Booker on 21 Jump Street) is also the name of a high school student who is failing French and needs to go to France with the French class to get extra credit to pass high school. He is also booked on the exact same flight. Since the British secret service don't know what the CIA agent looks like and Michael answers a phone call he thinks is from his mum before departure placed under the code name mother, it is naturally assumed he is Michael Corben, deep cover agent for the CIA.

Separated on the flight from the rest of the French class, Michael takes advantage of what he assumes is a mistake by the airline of a seat in first class. He tells the flight attendants to make sure he isn't bothered by some crazy woman who thinks she knows him but in reality is his angry teacher Mrs Grober (played by Robin Bartlett). Unbeknownst to Michael he is also protected by an armed CIA agent who unwittingly alerts Isla Grunt that she has not in fact killed her man as he places a gun against the head of the French teacher with what has now become the classic line - Stay Away From Michael Corben!

Whisked away at the airport by British Intelligence, Michael assumes they are busting him for sitting in first class and learns who they think he is.  He's not going to play along until they show him his million dollar sports car, so he tells them, yes he is Michael Corben deep cover agent for the CIA.  What follows is the funniest movie you'll ever see complete with spy gadgets such as X-ray sunglasses, a villain knocking out BO blast tuxedo and many others, all of which Michael of course has no idea how to use properly. His secret is only known by a beautiful girl called Mariska (played by Gabrielle Anwar) who pretty much keeps Michael on track of her murdered father's mission. Throw in the fact that his French class is mistaken by both sides to be enemy agents and his French teacher mistaken to be a deadly operative who must have got her name through teaching the French a lesson or two, and you've got the funniest action movie ever made.

Note this movie was also released in the UK under the title Teen Agent so those searching may well want to look under that title on UK retailers sites under that name as well.",1207699200,3,3727,4.3918722786647315

Next thing you know, he is soon sitting behind a Lamborgini complete with guns, parachute, and missiles, chasing a hot blonde babe.

What's more  is that when the scorpion that she pulls out to kill him with ends up on  her back, she begins to run around the hotel room, making it seem as if  she's purposely trying to bounce her cleavage.  Oh yeah, and one more  thing . . . Didn't seem a little dumb to try and kill a guy with a very  dangerous bug like a scorpion?
