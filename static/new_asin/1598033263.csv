7799913,2,1598033263,"This course seems to contain very little factual information.  He looks mainly at overall trends, such as the contacts between nations,  the different religions and the treatment of minorities and women.  There's very little mention of specific events or specific people.  It's very vague and watered-down.  He also talks a lot about the teaching of history, although very few people would care about that.",1413590400,10,406,5.28125
