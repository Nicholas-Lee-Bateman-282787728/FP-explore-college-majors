7862258,4,6304126573,"Made in 1949 as the Nationalist forces were on the verge of being driven from mainland China by Mao and the Communists, this film, while not too overtly pro-Communist (although there are slogans such as 'The New Year is here, and a New Society with it!'), is decidedly anti-Nationalist. (From other internet comments, it seems it was actually made under Nationalist control, with a tamed down script submitted to the censorship board.)

  The film centers around an apartment house in Shanghai and the several families and singles who live there. On the top floor are the Hous, a martinet Nationalist officer and his smug, scheming wife, depicted as purely evil. Hou was a collaborator during the Japanese occupation, yet found favor with the Nationalists afterward. With the communists descending on the city, he and other Nationalists in the city are depicted as being occupied solely with gathering as much profit as possible, through intimidation or fraud, to flee with, rather than any military resistance. Hou is using his position to purchase vast amounts of grain with government money, planning to sell it for private profit when panic hits and people are desperate. They 'own' the house, having commandeered it from Mr. Kong, a gentle and elderly proofreader who now lives alone in a single room. To make sure we totally despise Hou, he is trying to seduce Mrs. Hua. Mrs. Hou (or perhaps simply a mistress) could give Lady Macbeth a race for title of 'most evil woman', smiling and scheming, richly dressed with an artificial prettiness, taking smug pleasure in the misfortune of others and the exercise of petty power. To milk a final few ounces of gold out of the country before leaving, the Hous are trying to sell 'their' house, and to evict the others beforehand. Their servant Ah Mei, a simple and virtuous farm girl, fraternizes with, and is sympathetic to, the other residents.

  Mr. Hua is an impractical scholar, teaching at a local school. His wife is naturally attractive, the practical cement that holds the family and finances together and takes care of their child WeiWei. Hua is tangled up with the radical politics of several younger teachers, sympathetic yet fearful for his position. Mrs. Hua is negotiating to stay on as the 'responsible' family among the tenants, fending off broad hints by Hou that he could help relieve her loneliness while her husband spends long hours at school.

  WeiWei is stricken with pneumonia, saved only when Ah Mei steals some rare penicillin from the Hous, who had received it as collateral on a loan to the Xiao's, who are the other family (with several children) in the building. The Xiaos earn their living as street vendors of American goods, constantly obsessing with price and inventory. They are negotiating with the Hous to buy the house, but need to put through a scheme of buying gold (using that borrowed money) at official rates and reselling on the black market. Their mercenary plots allow the film to highlight the rampant inflation of the moment. There is one other single tenant, 'Little Broadcast' named for his habit of loudly broadcasting his thoughts and information.

  Each family has its own dramas, yet the center of the film is their joint effort to prevent evictions, while at the same time several are scheming against the others for the Hous' favor so they individually may stay. In the end, the evil Hous are driven away, as tiny sparrows can band together to drive away a predatory crow.

  As to production values, the film is similar to American films of 1930's or early 40's, though more complex in script than most. The emphasis, however, is the lives of the common people, rather than the escapism of the wealthy lives featured in US Depression era movies. The acting is excellent, portraying the varied characters with sensitivity and humor. The film copy and video transfer is probably as good as can be expected short of remastering, and the subtitles are clearly displayed on a translucent strip which isolates them from the white-on-white horror, yet allows enough of the underlying picture to show through for continuity, to me the ideal compromise between readability and overly harsh contrast. More film and video producers [hint: this means you, Criterion] should adopt this technology.",1090627200,8,4294,4.96931659693166
