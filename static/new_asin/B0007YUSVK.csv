2254173,5,B0007YUSVK,"The film version of Last Summer captures the mood and tone of the Fire Island teenagers it was meant to represent.  Another review asked ""where were the parents?""  The answer is probably drunk or stoned.  It was a time period of experimentation, and not always a model of responsibility.  The four young co-stars were brillantly cast in this coming of age story.  You've no doubt read the plot.  Three teens, 2 boys and a girl, form a strong and intimate relationship.  They allow a second girl in, but the first girl, and the boys who allow themselves to be led, begin to subtly and then overtly torment her.  It is sweet in the beginning, hard in the middle, and decidely cruel by the end.  It is unflinching and realistic, and not as far away as some seem to think.  A wonderful adaptation of Evan Hunter's novel.  Most reviews concentrate on the performance of Catherine Burns, who was nominated for an oscar for her role as the second girl, Rhoda.  Barbara Hershey was her equal as Sandy, the first girl.  Richard Thomas and Bruce Davisson worked very well together, and you could easily believe their own bond, prior to the introduction to Sandy.  This is a movie for a late Fall late night, when one is in a contemplative mood.",1132790400,16,1234,4.575342465753424
2254174,5,B0007YUSVK,"Late 60's coming of age psychodrama. Three teens(Bruce Davison, Richard Thomas, Barbara Hershey) on Fire Island deal with their awakening sexuality and a new resident, played by Catherine Burns(whatever happened to her?), who wants to be friends with them. The standout scene is when Burns delivers a monologue that is one of the finest ever filmed. I think she was nominated for an Oscar based on that scene alone. It's that moving. This movie is known best for it's ending but there's a lot more to appreciate. Directed by Frank Perry('The Swimmer').

I would love to see this one dvd with cast and crew reflections and a look at Fire Island, then and now.",1130976000,28,658,4.771929824561403
2254175,5,B0007YUSVK,"I saw this film when it first opened in NYC with the actor Richard Thomas in the audience, an instant turn on feature. It was I belive his first movie and was very touched by it's content. Since the topic deals with the pains and delights of growing up from childhood to adulthood. A critical period, that to all of us, is the stuff of the fondest memories and secrets.

It's an extraordinary movie very similar in many ways to ""Summer of 42"" released 2 years after ""Last Summer."" I have always considered that both films topics were by some means inter-related, or that the first one somehow, inspired the other to be made. ""Last Summer"" takes place in Fire Island, Long Island during the late 1960's social revolution, whereas the other story happen at a New England beach colony during the Second World War.

Unfortunatelly, while ""Summer of 42"" was released by Warner Brothers on DVD to great lyrical intensity. ""LAST SUMMER"" STILL AWAITS TO BE REDISCOVERED BY A NEWER GENERATION OF FILM LOVERS.

PLEASE CAN SOMEONE DO SOMETHING TO HAVE IT SOON RELEASED ON DVD. BECAUSE THIS STORY GOT SO MUCH SOUL THAT IT COULD BRAKE YOUR HEART.",1121472000,40,1133,4.655
2254176,5,B0007YUSVK,"1969's Last Summer, the film I first saw late night on '70s TV is a great classic experiment interested in creating moods. Richard Thomas (pre-John Boy) stands out as a confused teen and Barbara Hershey as the sex interest. Four teens on Fire Island in the late '60s, feeling the turbulent winds of the time through the collective unconscious.  I actually went to Fire Island in 1969 when this film was made (when I was five) and saw some real hippies there.

  Based on the book by Evan Hunter (Blackboard Jungle) Frank Perry's (David and Lisa, The Swimmer) direction is outstanding at creating a 1960s atmosphere, as does his other films of the era.",1115856000,11,651,4.684210526315789
2254177,4,B0007YUSVK,"This movie is erotic, disturbing, entertaining, and ultimately one to remember.  I'm surprised it is so expensive.  Maybe it needs reissuing!  The book actually had an odd format in which the two halves were roughly the same, with major phrases from the first half (the Seagull half) recurring in the second (dealing with Cathy Burns' character).  Bruce Davison, Richard Thomas and Barbara Hershey are all quite good in their roles.  That trio forms an alliance, one into which Cathy Burns tries to wedge herself.  They let her in, only to turn on her with devastating results at the end.

It was an early film for all four, but they create scenes that will stay with you a long time.  I do have to wonder though: where are the parents?  These teens do pretty much whatever they want with no one to stop them.  They are the four people you'll remember.  They are the movie, and it will stay with you long after you finish it for many reasons.",1111449600,11,942,4.5476190476190474
2254178,5,B0007YUSVK,"It was an incredible and memorable movie for me.  Particularly because it was filmed in my backyard, the Bay Shore, West Islip Fire Island area.  Several of my 1969 high school classmates were filmed with Barbara Hershey dancing at the famous
Oak Beach Inn.
We are trying to get a copy of the movie for our 1969 - 35th reunion, but we understand it has not been released for sale.
Those were the days, and Barbara Hershey & Richard Thomas were young and captured the essence of youth.",1086566400,4,484,4.488636363636363
8054521,5,B0007YUSVK,"With all the DVD dreck that is out there, somehow this 1969 masterpiece hasn't been released on DVD. Rated X in '69 (when the X merely meant no one under 17 admitted, and not porn), this truly ""lost"" film (according to Wikipedia, only a 16mm print of it exists somewhere, no 35MM prints exist) is a groundbreaking study of adolescent cruelty, peer pressure, loneliness and evil. Three gorgeous teens (Richard Thomas, Bruce Davison & Barbara Hershey) form an isolated summer beach clique that is tested when a chubby outcast (Catherine Burns, Oscar nominated) enters the picture. The games they play with her, just for ""fun,"" are extremely unsettling and ultimately shattering. Also very depressing; the film's down-elevator-to-hell ending probably alienated many viewers, especially teenagers, who didn't want to particularly see what brutes they could be. Acting, writing, photography & direction are first rate, but it's genuinely dated - a radio plays NY's WABC radio with Dj Ron Lundy, a pot smoking scene features sitar music, and so on. But it was daring for the time, and probably remains so, despite the plethora of explicit teen movies that have come since. This film bites you. The VHS copy I own is a prized possession. It occasionally shows up on TCM. Watch out for it.",1381968000,3,1281,5.018779342723005
8054522,3,B0007YUSVK,"This movie isn't worth spending $179 to see.  Thankfully, I didn't have to do that.  TCM happened to play this very rare film last week and I DVR'd it for my viewing pleasure.  I don't know if I can really label it `pleasure' though, since the film itself has a lot of issues.

I will say this.  The film is VERY hard to find.  It doesn't have a DVD release and the only available versions are VHS and are astronomically priced, and it is not a film that makes regular rotations on television (it is an X-Rated film) so I do highly recommend actually seeing it if given the opportunity.  It contains one of the best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations I've seen, and that's saying a lot.  It is also one of the most surprising nominations I've seen, considering the film itself, the themes presented and the celebrity that Catherine Burns wasn't (this was her first feature film and really her only film of note).  So, if you are a cinephile you'll want to see this.

Sadly, Catherine Burns is really where this film begins and ends.  Her portrayal of social outcast Rhoda is astonishing.  She bleeds with true emotional complexity.  Her line reading of the account of her mother's death is phenomenal and truly should be studied by aspiring actors and actresses everywhere.  She manages to create an obnoxious character who is equal parts endearing and heartbreaking.  Sadly, the rest of the acting is horrendous.  Barbara Hershey looks like she is trying to audition of a slutty variation of Marsha Brady.  Bruce Davison is just plain creepy (especially when he starts mouth cupping Hershey's shoulder) and Richard Thomas is obnoxious to a complete fault.  His laughter makes me want to leave the room.

But really, the acting isn't the nail in `Last Summer's coffin; it is the script.  The concept is a good one, for it has potential to expound on budding sexuality and the power of sexual manipulation, but the film never really discovers how to execute that properly.  Instead, the whole thing feels unnecessarily cheap.  It lacks the depth needed to make those themes feel relevant or poignant in any way and instead it laces most of the scenes with a camp value I feel was unintentional.  The final scene, which is devastating for sure, loses some of the impact because of the abrasiveness that feels out of place, especially for the film's development of Richard Thomas's character.

At the end of the day, poor acting and unsubstantial plotting make this a less than effective film, but I recommend all cinephiles to see this for the rarity of the experience and for Burns' devastating turn.",1340755200,4,2601,4.754464285714286
8054523,2,B0007YUSVK,"summer sans souci... prolonged diatribe on flirting with disaster and how bikinis drove young men wild and the women who wore them seek revenge for any ills perceived real or imagined... a day or two in the super boring lives of 4 teens with no parental interaction or supervision... least they did not litter or plan anarchy! big fan of Richard Thomas and was delighted to see his first foray into sexual undertones as he is most remembered as one uptight righteous dude! Rhoda most likely had the best memories of the group for that summer, she finally fit in....sigh",1340496000,,569,4.7
8054524,5,B0007YUSVK,"I saw this movie when it first came out.

I was impressed by all the young actors, esp Barbara Hershey and Richard Thomas, who couldn't have been much more than 14 or 15 at the time.

It's an amazing movie, both truly ugly in theme and captivating anyway.

A coming-of-age movie with some really nasty turns.

It impressed me enormously in my early adolescence.

A must-see, as far as I'm concerned.",1329091200,2,399,4.563380281690141
8054525,5,B0007YUSVK,"Released in 1969, ""Last Summer"" relays the random escapades of three teenagers - two guys and a gal - who form a close-knit trio while vacationing on Fire Island, NY, where the film was shot. The girl, Sandy (Barbara Hershey), obviously enjoys the attentions of the two boys (Richard Thomas & Bruce Davison), who essentially deem her a goddess. Then an average-looking, pudgy girl named Rhoda enters the picture and tries to join the trio (Catherine Burns). One of the guys, Peter (Thomas), starts to develop a genuine relationship with this new girl which naturally stirs up jealous malevolence in Sandy.

At one point, When Rhoda and Peter are enjoying some time together, she remarks (paraphrasing): ""You seem like a totally different person when you're with me than when you're with them."" This leads to an unexpected ending which is reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies-Essential-Art-House/dp/B001BEK8EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House</a>.""

""Last Summer"" is a unique coming-of-age film featuring a fascinating study of the herd mentality: Alone, the three are normal teenagers, but together their inhibitions and sense of morality diminish. Set at one of the most beautiful beach settings on the East Coast, the film hints at the possibility that Fire Island itself is an accessory in unleashing the youths' disturbing deviance.

But, mostly, this is a commentary on the dark side of hedonistic adolescence and the power of a sociopath, meaning Sandy. Her maniacal laugh, what she ultimately does to a seagull, her treatment of Rhoda, and her manipulation of the two nave boys, testify to this.  Naturally, entry into Sandy's clique is the admission of some past act of cruelty. Why? Because she subtly revels in cruelty and despises compassion.

Unfortunately ""Last Summer"" is only available on VHS and, of course, is ridiculously expensive from sellers. But TCM (or AMC) will likely show it again sometime.

GRADE: A",1328659200,3,2026,5.477564102564102
8054526,4,B0007YUSVK,"In LAST SUMMER, young Peter (Thomas) and Dan (Davison) are enjoying a Fire Island vacation when they meet Sandy (Hershey) under highly unusual circumstances. She's come to the aid of a seagull with a fish hook lodged in its throat. Through much coaxing, Sandy convinces the reluctant boys to help the injured creature.

Once the hook is removed, the bird is placed on a tether by Sandy; she soon thinks of it as a pet. Coddled and cared for, the gull becomes domesticated; it even forgets how to fly (or perhaps no longer wishes to). An unusual facet of Sandy's personality (that involves the bird) is later revealed.

The teens bond. They drink ""truth serum"" (Heineken's beer) that makes them reveal personal secrets and romp in sun and surf. Sandy has a penchant for going topless; clearly she's teasing the boys.

A nerdy girl named Rhoda (Best Supporting nominee Burns) invades their circle. The trio keep her at arm's length even while attempting to influence Rhoda's choice in swimwear. They also roughly try to alleviate her fear of the ocean.

As a lark, Sandy puts false information on a computer dating service card, thinking they'll never find a match for her imaginary alter-ego. When a date is actually set up however, the gang of three force Rhoda to go out with a much older Hispanic gent, Anibal (Gonzalez). All five have a fun night, but Anibal later comes to regret his computer date.

Some other adventures follow: weed smoking, life story sharing, flirtation. Ultimately, there's a rather unexpected and shocking conclusion to this coming of age tale. It's no wonder that ""Last Summer"" received an 'X' rating when released in 1969. (NOTE: with the first MPAA system, 'X' didn't always denote sexual content.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MIDNIGHT-COWBOY/dp/B004PKFE6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MIDNIGHT COWBOY</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SOLDIER-BLUE/dp/B000ION22Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SOLDIER BLUE</a>, for example, were originally 'X' rated.)

Here, Bruce Davison is a geeky adolescent and Barbara Hershey seems nearly unrecognizable with that long, baby-fine hair. We remember Richard Thomas as John Boy Walton, so seeing him a tad younger is no surprise. An ironic twist is that Thomas's dad is played by Ralph Waite, who would also be his father on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-WALTONS/dp/B001VB8UGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the WALTONS</a>&nbsp;TV series.

8054527,4,B0007YUSVK,"This movie and another with Barbara Hershey, ""The Pursuit of Happiness""(1971), deserve at least a basic DVD treatment.  There are so many entertaining films from that late 60s, early 70s era which I fear will be forgotten soon.

The only place you can see a lot of these movies is TCM.  Why can't they print their own DVDs?  Even if you had to special order them and they had to be pressed by request, I would pay for it.  I think a lot of other people who spend their time like me searching for old films would also.",1242864000,4,517,4.23469387755102
8054528,5,B0007YUSVK,I recently saw the movie on youtube and I can't say enough good things about it. The greatest thing about some of Frank Perry's movies is that they are so real and leave you asking yourself so many questions about the characters and eventually the viewer gets to draw they're own conclusions. A lot of people don't like to be left hanging with so many questions but I think it's brilliant. This kind of movie making is gone now and I miss it. If ever a movie deserved to be released on DVD this is it. Can we get together and get on Warner Brothers butt to release this wonderful movie on DVD.,1240444800,6,593,4.256637168141593
8054529,5,B0007YUSVK,"Three teens vacationing with their parents on Fire Island during the late 1960's forge a bond out of friendship, sexual longing and boredom. The catalyst for this bond is Sandy, a beautiful bikini clad 16 year old who is discovered by Peter and Dan as she attempts to rescue a seagull that has swallowed a fishing line. When Rhoda, a pudgy, straight-laced girl enters the threesome, she becomes the incorruptible moral conscience of the group, and a threat to Sandy's dominance over the two boys. The resulting conflict brings into question the ability of logic and reason to counter the primal power of carnal desire. In an environment free from moral or physical constraints, human beings, if left to their own devices, will digress to their baser natures. Last Summer is a film that grabs you by your senses - the sights and sounds of the beach; bright blue sky, blue-green Ocean, slow breaking waves, white sand, seagulls - the general buzz of nature that heightens the senses. Add to the mix a beautiful fully developed 16 year old girl, ripe with sexuality and willing to exploit its power, and you have a force of nature almost impossible for two hormone filled teenage boys to resist with tragic consequences. An overlooked beautifully shot masterpiece that turns the ""coming of age"" genre inside out.",1139356800,14,1309,4.874439461883408
8054530,5,B0007YUSVK,"There are certain movies from my childhood that were more frightening then any horror film - one of them is ""Last Summer"" and it is easy to see how similar this film is to ""Lord of the Flies"", in this case teenagers and not children are left to their own devices without parental interference in any way - basically the story is the same, that human nature is cruel and hierarchy building and will destroy the most vulnerable souls in the quest for power and dominance. That even those with perhaps the greatest potential for kindness - in this case Richard Thomas (& brilliant here), will run with the tribe if forced to make a choice between doing what is good and standing alone or doing unspeakable cruelty to be spared the tyrany of the majority. In reality, unlike Lord of the Flies, by acting on his better self the dynamic would have been tied as there are only 4 characters here -- however, the point of this movie is that human nature is basically weak of character and depraved and therefore a nihilistic view of humanity - which we see in the broken bird that must be killed as it is not strong enough to fight for its existence; as a metaphor for the fat girl who although morally superior is physically weak and therefore damaging to the social order in her quest for supremacy against the beauty and strength, portrayed to perfection by Barbara Hershey. Perhaps this movie is meant to show there is no room for nuance in nature and that the weak must be eliminated to make room for the survival of the fittest-- This is why I think this movie stays with you - I like to think the fat girls reasoned arguments for humanity as separate and better then the will of nature is supreme and true but this movie doesn't take that stand on this issue and leaves you to ponder the other point of view equally - that Ms Hershey is a queen bee who must fulfil her rightful place -  there is no  moral to this story, no feel good conclusion and it hurts. It is a great, small and underestimated film - The boys here by the way are meerly pawns in this dynamic. All 4 leads are superb -  Great screenplay by Perry who also with his wife wrote and directed another gem ""the Swimmer"" .",1136851200,26,2184,4.361179361179361
