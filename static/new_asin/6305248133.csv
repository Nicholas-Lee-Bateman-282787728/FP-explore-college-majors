7885897,3,6305248133,"Three and a half stars. Not as bad as some would have you believe, but when it is compared to White Zombie (as it must be), it is found lacking.
The Good:
A lot is right about this movie. Halperin does another good job with a low budget and an exotic setting. While I doubt the crew ever went to SE Asia, the film does an admirable job of transporting the audience to the mysterious time and place of what would be Viet Nam in the years World War One.
In the plot, a meek British soldier in love with a girl who loves his friend discovers the secret to controlling minds. The doomed romance angle explored in Revolt is intelligent, even interesting, building as it does on some of the themes present in White.
It just isn't handled in a very thrilling manner. Which leads me to...
The Bad:
There is not much action in this movie. There is quite a lot of talk. A predictable outcome. Uneven performances. No Lugosi. And only two or three brief scenes possessing the surreal horror which infused White with such atmospheric, dreamlike menace.
Too much of the film is taken up by the young lovers, making this less like White Zombie and more like White Christmas.
The Ugly:
Plus, the audience is left with no one to root for. Certainly you can't root for the guy turning men into murdering zombies. But I can't find it in my heart to root for his callous ""friends,"" either, who drove him to such lengths by toying with his heartstrings. But maybe that's just me, the romantic monster film fan.
The Extras:
The extras on the disc are spare but amusing, including a trivia game. For correct answers you are treated to footage of a zombie being bludgeoned in Night of the Living Dead. For wrong answers you are mocked with a clip of this movie's villain laughing in your face. Nice.",1006214400,4,1776,4.434250764525994
