331811,5,6301417097,"""The Brave One"" - 'A Touch of Greatness', so proclaims the movie
posters of that era, a statement that I fully agree with.

The movie was made on location in Mexico and released in 1956.
It was beautifully filmed in the harsh, clear, Mexican sun.

The movie introduces us to the likeable and talented young star
Michel Ray but in fact he had previously appeared in the 1954
British film ""The Divided Heart"".

Prolific composer Victor Young wrote the exciting music score
for this movie, his last before his untimely death in 1956.
He had composed the music for many other other movies including
""Shane"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days"" for which he won an
Academy Award.

""The Brave One"" won an Academy Award in 1956 for Best Screenplay
and the movie credits name Robert Rich as the writer of the
screenplay. As it turned out there was no such person as Robert
Rich, in fact Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay and Robert Rich
was an alias. Dalton Trumbo was living in Mexico after he had
left Hollywood following the communist purge in the 1950's.
He never appeared at the Academy Awards presentation and only
received his oscar many years after the event. He died shortly
thereafter.

The story is about a young peasant boy Leonardo (Michel Ray)
and his love and devotion to his pet bull Gitano (Gypsy) which
he raised from a calf. Being a fighting bull it is destined for
the bullring when it is four years old but Leonardo cannot
accept this as his pet's fate. The boy never gives up in his
desperate bid to save the bull but to no avail.

The bullfight scenes are harsh and cruel but in the end Gitano
survives by displaying unusual courage. The crowd who are
impressed by Gitano demand an 'undulto' (reprieve) for the
animal thus saving it from the ritual death in the bullring.

Here at last is ""The Brave One"" digitally restored to its
former glory and presented with a pristine transfer on the
VCI label. The picture quality is stunning and the sound for
the first time is robust and clear.

This important movie, restored to its original splendour,
is a special event in all stages of restoration including
sound (taken from a 4 track stereo cinemascope release print)
and cinemascope photography in handsome technicolor.

This is definitely a family movie full of warmth and
sensitivity and one to be enjoyed by all ages.

Great entertainment.",1290816000,2,2354,4.664251207729468

Thank you so much.

My grand-children request this DVD be played over and above many of the present day movies  as it takes them in to a world that reaches out to their feelings and emotions.",1265760000,,323,4.47457627118644
331814,5,6301417097,"Being a life long audiophile and classical music lover, I was ready, at the age of 16, in 1957, to be deeply impressed when I saw ""The Brave One"" first run, in CinemaScope, with four channel magnetic sound, at the Norwest theater in Detroit. This King Brothers film, about a boy who falls in love with a bull, was billed as ""The motion picture from the human heart for the human heart."" The Dalton Trumbo story, combined with an awesome Victor Young score, and supported by a magnificent performance by Michel Ray with a fine supporting cast and direction, has stood the test of time. In spite of it's cost of a days pay at the time, I ran out and purchased the LP sound track album (Decca DL8344) because I was filled with mad lust to hear the music. I still have this album, and I have seen it listed for sale to collectors for $300. This should indicate the eloquent and vibrant quality of the music. Over the years I have purchased this film on VHS, LASERDISK, and now this wonderful DVD. In my opinion, this is the greatest movie ever made about the love of a small boy for an animal. I consider it to be virtually impossible to watch this film without ending up with tears in your eyes and a lump in your throat. I have screened it for many friends, some of whom are fans of this genre, and they all agree with me that the King Brothers gave us the King. This new DVD has outstanding image quality, and the best sound of all the versions that I have heard. The beautiful integration of music and title images sends chills down ones back right from the first foot of film, as the sound of the xylophone sparks the lightning bolts shooting out from the radio tower spelling out ""RKO RADIO PICTURES."" This wonderful old logo was designed and photographed by Linwood Dunn, the head of the RKO special effects department, whom I was fortunate enough to meet one day and discuss his work. No film shows off this wonderful logo as well as ""The Brave One."" Michel Ray quit acting and got a fine education in business. He went on to Wall Street and made millions. Eventually, he married the daughter of Freddy Heineken, the Dutch brewer. The happy couple are worth billions, and recently were major investors in the the new James Bond film ""Casino Royale"" starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.",1265414400,15,2289,4.4523809523809526

The photography is excellent. With the Wide-Screen view and its clarity,the film makes it feel like you are right there at the arenas. The street scenes  are actual shots of everyday traffic. See if you can quickly name some of those classic automobiles.
The acting is natural and the dialog is very good. It is a heart warming story of a young teen age boy and his pet bull.",1223942400,5,399,4.465753424657534
331816,5,6301417097,"""The Brave One"" is about a peasant boy who runs away to Mexico City to save his brave bull, Gitano... Irving Rapper directed the beautiful simple story of Leonardo and his attachment to his pet bull with understanding... It has an authentic look in the bullring, on ranches and in Mexican streets... It has humor, attachment, determination, bravery, suspense, and a terrific climax...

The highlights of the film are many as the weaning and branding of the bulls and how they are tested in the open fields; la Fiesta Brava filling resplendently in the gold and pink brocades of Mexico, mixing with the elegance of swirling capes; the father of Leonardo (Rodolfo Hoyos) trying to make Leonardo understand that the pet bull is born to die in the ring - the reason of his life -

With a tremendous score and an outstanding color photography of exceptional beauty, Jack Cardiff realized the most beautiful and expressive scenery of the Mexican landscapes... ""The Brave One"" had the flavor of the bullfight game and its devotees and hangers-on...",1166400000,8,1041,4.909090909090909

331818,5,6301417097,"The Brave One was beautifully crafted in 1957 by blacklisted author Robert Rich and immediately established itself as a superb classic. The tale is of a small Mexican boy and his enduring love for his courageous pet bull. Set in Mexico, a boy discovers a cow has been killed after delivering and orphaning a male offspring. Naming the calf Gitano, The boy becomes it's friend and caretaker. Realizing the boy's loneliness, the parents encourage the bond, but fail to emphasis the eventual fate of the animal. Throughout the Calf's life the boy's love inexorably grows unaware of his parent's financial responsibility to the bull's true owner. By the time the animal has grown to market size and becomes a cash commodity, the boy's parents are torn between their son's love and their duty to the Patrone. Using subterfuge, the parents separate the two. Returning from a fool's errand, the boy discovers his best friend and lifetime companion has been sold for the purpose of bull fighting and its eventual destruction. Despite the frantic warnings of his parents that it's too late to save the animal, the small boy adroitly played by Michel Rey, sets off to save his courageous friend from certain death. The boy visits everyone from the Patrone to the Governnor of Mexico in a vain attempt to alter the fate of his pet. The film culminates with the boy's magnificent bravery before an arena filled with spectators. True loyalty to any animal has never had a more poignant test of love and courage. For any viewer with a human heart, this tear-wrenching film will leave you joyfully weeping. ****",1125014400,31,1596,4.8713235294117645

The ride atop an old farm truck into Mexico City is a beautiful scene suggesting a ""Wizard of Oz"" affection and the only drawback is the kid's unremarkable ability to show expressions of joy, sadness, excitement, etc., as the camera focuses in on his face.

331952,5,6301417097,"We learned of this Academy award winning movie by watching Trumbo, a bio of the life of Dalton Trumbo, one of the blacklisted 10 screenwriters during the McCarthy era. Trumbo wrote the screenplay but the credits list another not-blacklisted author (if you haven't seen Trumbo yet, you can get the back story there). Delightful heart-warming story. The suspense builds and builds until you can't imagine any ""heart-warming"" outcome but---
Amazing photography from an era before any disclaimers about ""no animals were harmed in the making of this movie,"" Lots of research had to go in to production. Almost all actors are Mexican speaking English as second language, adding authenticity to the story. Credits at end thank the Mexican people for help in creating the movie. As always, Trumbo's screenplay is a delight to hear, with overtones of social justice/decency/honesty/bravery which are timeless.",1473724800,,900,5.345070422535211

331960,5,6301417097,"This is NOT an objective review of the film.  I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 12.  As the end of film approached, I still remember furiously trying to stop crying before the house lights came up so the other kids would not laugh at me.  The story is a simple one of a boy and his best friend, a bull named Gitano.  Some will call this film corny and overly sentimental.  Others will call it heartwarming. All I can say is that the experience  affected me deeply then and still does now.  The reasons I think ALL viewers should feel positive about the film include;  The respect the screenplay shows for the Mexican people, their culture and traditions (imo, this view of Mexico is unusual for a film released in the U.S. in the 50's).  The beautiful cinematography of Jack Cardiff.  The wonderful, emotional musical score by Victor Young.  The performance of child actor Michael Rey as Leonardo (not polished, but still ""spot on""). Most importantly, for the editing, both picture and sound, of the final scene in the Mexico City bullfighting ring..

Is the Blu-ray a noticeable improvement over the DVD release of the ""Brave One""?  A respected reviewer of just about every Blu-ray produced not only in North America but also international releases as well, gave this disc a terrible review.  This person is usually very objective and rarely nasty.  HE IS WRONG ABOUT THE BLU-RAY OF ""THE BRAVE ONE"".  It is one of the best transfers of a catalog title I have seen!!!  Cardiff''s cinematography looks almost 3-D.

For those of you who start to ""tear up"" at the line ""Gitano, my little gypsy, now we can live!!!, buy this Blu-ray.  For those of you who are not sentimental fools like me, I ask that you grant me an ""idulto"".  (If you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.).

331980,5,6301417097,"THE BRAVE ONE is one of the most moving a boy and his dog stories ever filmed, except, instead of a canine, this boy loves a pet bull.

The simple plot concerns Leonardo (Michel Ray), a young peasant boy, who raises a  calf to be a fighting bull, then, in an exciting race against time, seeks out the President of Mexico in an effort to save his friend from the bull ring.

This heartwarming film has a controversial history.  People first began to wonder about it when Robert Rich, credited writer of the original story for the 1956 film, failed to show up on Academy Award night to claim the Oscar that he had won.

Rich was, in fact, a pseudonym for blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo.  The ensuing debate was the initial step towards the acceptance of blacklisted American screenwriters back into the Hollywood mainstream.

VCI Entertainment has released THE BRAVE ONE e onto Blu=ray in a gorgeous Technicolor restoration.  The magnificent music score by Victor Young is also available on an isolated audio track.

331983,3,6301417097,"I recently saw the film TRUMBO, about blacklisted Hollywood writer Dalton Trumbo. Because of the blacklist, he wrote under the pseudonym Robert Rich. ""Rich"" won the 1957 Academy Award  for Best Writing for the film THE BRAVE ONE. I had to see the movie, but as an animal lover, it was hard to bring myself to see the story of a Mexican boy and his beloved bull. I didn't have to be a psychic to know where the story would lead.

I finally got ready to see the film expecting I would truly love it (except for bullfighting scenes). The DVD I got did not seem to be a great transfer and the Cinemascope seemed to lose power on the small screen but the rich colors made up for any technical shortcomings. An interesting spoiler alert is that the packaging for my DVD tells the complete story of the movie down to the end so it's clear the direction the story will go and how it will all end.

There is much to appreciate about THE BRAVE ONE. It is a loving and heartwarming story of love and loyalty. Any scene with Leonardo (Michel Ray) is sweet and delightful but the rest of the film is a disappointment. The cruelty of bullfighting will be hard to digest for some and that is where the film loses any power it is building.  Leonardo hopes his beloved bull Gitano (Spanish for GYPSY) that he raised from birth will prove his courage in trials so he will be spared the bullring and be used for ""seed"" to father a line of courageous bulls.

Ownership of Gitano is contested. Is he the property of Gitano's father or of the ranch where he works? Leonardo's dedication to Gitano seems to always win out until the end. When Gitano is eventually taken to the bullring in Mexico City, Leonardo follows. The sweet story takes a dark turn and a rather improbable turn as Leonardo runs through the streets of Mexico City trying to help for Gitano. A village boy in an enormous city for the first time running to different locations in a short time?  If you are an animal lover, the bullfighting scenes can be disturbing even though they are very toned down for the film. I wasn't sure if we were seeing an actual bullfight or a recreation with fake lances in the bulls. It's a cruel and mismatched sport where the bulls are taunted and weakened. It's tough to watch.

Little Michel Ray is adorable as sweet Leonardo but his acting is stilted and his scenes of pleading and crying are not so realistic especially as he watches Gitano tormented in the bullring. It seemed strange to see him attempting to speak English but with a Mexican accent. In the end, I was expecting so much more from an Academy Award winning film.",1459382400,8,2610,4.425

332151,5,6301417097,It was a very old movie that I thought I would never find. It was just as good as when I saw it years ago. I would recommend it to anyone.,1357862400,,138,3.4838709677419355

332153,3,6301417097,"This early Cinemascope classic deserves better.  It is not 16:9, but letterboxed 4:3 with poor resolution and less than perfect color - it appears to be the old laserdisc transfer.  It deserves better.",1326240000,8,201,5.0606060606060606
332154,5,6301417097,"Words can scarcely express how great this all-ages movie is. I was unfamiliar with this film until coming across a video copy several years ago, and it is unfortunate that this film is so little known, even among cinemaphiles.  This restored DVD, presented in Cinemascope, is the one to get (and I highly recommend that you do get it).

I will not repeat what has already been said by other reviewers, except to say that the film has everything going for it:  an excellent cast (led by young Michel Ray), fine direction (by Irving Rapper), authentic Mexican locations, excellent widescreen color cinematography (by the great Jack Cardiff), a great story and Academy Award winning screenplay (by then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo), and a beautiful Latin-flavored symphonic soundtrack (by Victor Young), which has to be one of the best ever film scores.  (As an aside, I also recommend acquiring a copy of the original Decca soundtrack LP or the Japanese exact repro reissue LP, which are both available for sale on Amazon at the time of this posting {to my knowledge, there has never been a CD issue to date}.  I cannot listen to this score without experiencing profound emotions, and the same thing goes for viewing the film.)

The stunning denouement of the picture, which I will not reveal here, ends with one of the most intensely moving lines in all of cinema.  A timeless classic for all, and five stars all the way--don't miss it!!",1323129600,,1434,4.852459016393443

7812175,5,6301417097,"Although the movie was produced in 1956, the picture quality was very good.  The aspect ratio of the film (2.35:1) was not to my liking -  even on my widescreen TV, but the script, and the acting made up for this deficiency.  This is an excellent film for the whole family, and it offers good moral redeeming value.",1501372800,,315,4.396551724137931

7812179,5,6301417097,"A great story line; o.k. many would argue that it is a ""disney"" type of film.  Having said that I ordered it because I was curious about the screen writer, Dalton Trumbo who wrote this film under a false name as he was blacklisted.  In addition, having been a film buff I was always curious about the type of product that came out of King Bros. Studios who made a lot of ""B"" and even ""C"" movies.  Anyway, the story can be shared with your grandkids with no embarasment and adults find it interesting.  Personally I despise the practice of bull fighting but there wasn't the true blood and gore in this film that one would see at a regular bull fight.",1494892800,2,650,4.30327868852459
