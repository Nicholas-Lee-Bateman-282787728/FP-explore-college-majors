8483153,5,B005QB2JPC,"While many 3D art training websites have been existence for longer than Eat3D, few match Eat3D's level of quality in their content.  The Mudbox introductory DVD provides an extensive overview of the features of Mudbox 2012.  While the DVD will work for anyone interested in using Mudbox for 3D sculpting or painting, the DVD is really aimed at video game developers.  Its author has actual shipped titles to his name lending a great deal of credibility to his work on this as well as other Eat3D DVDs.

The DVD's included training videos are presented in 720p resolution and last for about 4.5 hours.  The videos are played by default using Adobe Flash Player.  However, if you prefer your own video application, the individual files are available on the DVD and can be viewed at will.  Each video corresponds to a specific topic or related topics enabling skipping training you have already covered or do not want to view.

The training begins with a thorough introduction to the Mudbox interface beginning with the welcome screen you see when the program is launched.  The next couple of videos cover the Mudbox sculpt and paint brushes and how to import and export meshes to or from another 3D package such as 3DS Max, Maya, Modo, etc.  After the introductory topics, new training sections begin teaching you how to prepare meshes for sculpting and painting as well as Mudbox's mesh pose tools.  This sections lead into some of Mudbox's more advanced topics such as sculpting using curves, the material and lighting engine used in Mudbox, viewport filters designed to enhance your sculpting experience and how to extract texture maps from your meshes.  Texture based sculpting and a section on rendering close out the second half of the training DVD.

The majority of 3D art training DVDs suffer from the same problem that thankfully is not present in the Mudbox DVD.  The authors present little more than a brain dump of their personal knowledge that do not explain anything with greater detail than the programs documentation.  While the first two parts of this DVD presents information in this blow by blow fashion, the final sections reinforce everything you have learned with a concrete example.  The box art shows the final project that you will complete if you follow the DVD's content.  A production quality wall sculpt similar to what you would find in a AAA videogame.  This project is truly worth the price of the entire DVD even if you already have a working knowledge of its features.

The instructor begins inside of 3DS Max exporting the base mesh into Mudbox.  From there, he goes on to sculpt the entire wall to completion.  Unlike some training DVD's, there are no skipped sections in order to decrease the run time.  The entire process is presented in full with detailed commentary from the instructor.  The DVD even includes the 3DS Max base mesh in Max's native format along with a .OBJ version of the file for import into other modeling packages.  The original concept art for the wall is also present as well as the instructors final wall sculpt in Mudbox's native format.

If you are interested in learning 3D sculpting, particularly if your interest is game-centric, this is the training DVD to invest in.  The amount of content is extraordinary and will not disappoint newcomers or veterans.  Even if you have an established and solid workflow, there is a high likelihood you will pick up at least one new trick for your artist's toolbox.",1341360000,,3467,4.8520408163265305
