2510001,5,B000E8QVC4,"The songs are great, and i always wanted to own a copy of this animated movie but could never find it in stores.

Its got a good theme behind this story. So its a great movie to watch with kids and family.",1356480000,,205,3.880952380952381
2510002,3,B000E8QVC4,"The main reason I purchased this item was that there are several songs by Steve Perry. I was disappointed, however, not to get the music video of him singing ""I Stand Alone"" which is clearly listed on the packaging. I have learned since then it is supposed to be on the ""Special Edition."" I feel kind of cheated that I did not get this.
I have not yet watched ""Cats Don't Dance.""  I would recommend ""Quest for Camelot"" for ages 10 and up.",1355356800,,438,4.27710843373494
2510003,4,B000E8QVC4,I have always loved Cats Don't Dance. It is comic gold and the music is superb when compared to most Disney or Bluth films. Great plot and fun for adults and children alike. Quest for Camelot is... well it's a movie. It has an all star cast which as usual sets up for a rather mediocre plot. I would not purchase it by itself but it turns out my daughter loves it so this set was an excellent buy for me.,1328832000,,404,4.0
2510004,5,B000E8QVC4,"I have always loved both of these movies.  They are silly and predictable, but they are perfect children's stories.  They came in great condition and at a great price.",1310342400,,167,4.724137931034483
2510005,3,B000E8QVC4,"This was purchased for a 4-yr old girl & was disappointing in that she was slightly entertained by the ""Cats Don't Dance"" DVD, but she didn't care for the ""Quest for Camelot"" one at all & suggested that we ""take it back!"" Ithink I could have made a better choice than this particular double DVD set.",1281312000,,299,4.357142857142857
2510006,4,B000E8QVC4,I purchased this DVD for the movie Cats Don't Dance but my nephew liked Quest for Camalot too. Cat's Don't Dance had an original plot and nice animation. Both are great for younger children.,1243209600,2,190,4.617647058823529
2510007,5,B000E8QVC4,THIS ITEM WAS A FAVORITE FOR OUR 5 YR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER . SHE HAD HOURS OF FUN WITH THIS  & SHARED WITH HER FRIENDS ON A SLEEP-OVER.,1240272000,3,133,3.75

2510025,5,B000E8QVC4,"Quest for Camelot is a good movie but Cats Don't Dance is a GREAT one! It's a poor-boy-makes-good-in-Hollywood pic, but of course everything is ramped up because it's a cartoon. The music is by Randy Newman and it's terrific -- I've wound up listening to it over and over. The lead is voiced by Scott Bakula of science fiction TV fame -- did you know he can sing (and really, really well)? The female lead is voiced by Jasmine Guy but the singing is Natalie Cole and you know she can sing. A friend loaned this disk to me and now I'm buying two more, one for me and one as a Christmas present.",1446940800,,593,4.2105263157894735
2510026,5,B000E8QVC4,These are great movies. Bask in the nostalgia.,1439683200,,46,4.875

2510035,5,B000E8QVC4,"I had my doubts originally about this set.  I had not seen the films before, nor heard too much about them (I vaguely remember theatrical trailers for ""Quest for Camelot"", though).  But I was having a bad day and found it in the bargain bin.  I figured ""why not?""... it could at least brighten my day a little.  So I gave it a chance...and discovered that sometimes precious gems aren't always popularly recognized for what they are.  For this review, I will discuss the general packaging and content issues, then the individual films.  They truly don't make animated films like this, anymore.

GENERAL PACKAGING:
The visuals aren't exactly all that impressive in terms of the case.  It's really basic and seems to be more or less put together just to put it out on shelves and make a quick buck (and cut down costs).  However, it does it's job:  you know what the movies are, you know what's on the discs, etc.  But with that said, contained in this set are two DVDs, one for each movie.  And the discs seem to be the originals from the original single-DVD sets.  They are secured in a safe, multi-page set up...and everything is safely in-cased in plastic.  In short, though the visual presentation of the case is rather basic...the discs are responsibly placed and secured.  It should be noted that the disc ""Quest For Camelot"" is a doubled-sided disc with one side having the movie and the other side carrying the special features.  ""Cat's Can't Dance"" just has a single-sided disc for both movie and special features.

CONTENT ISSUES:
These are G rated films and originally produced for kids and family.  Language isn't an issue and there's not much innuendo. Everything's pretty tame, honestly and safe for the whole family.

[""QUEST FOR CAMELOT""]:
The synopsis on the box for this film is actually very misleading.  It says ""A young girl who wonders why only boys can become Knights of the Round Table...""  When actually, that issue never comes up.  If anything, she is held back because of a tragic event that affected her family.  And none of the knights or Arthur tell her she can't.  Rather, this film is a powerful presentation about facing your fears, honoring your legacy, waiting for the right moment, not letting handicaps hold you down, the influence of kind mentorship and genuine confidence in others, and doing good in the face of evil.  This film is the weaker of the set...but it is more than capable of being on par with its Disney counterparts.

THE ANIMATION...
 is beautifully rendered with some very majestic camera angles befitting a tale meant to be epic.  I loved the detail that they put into the characters and the background.  It did not feel cheap at all.  The expressions that the characters made were wonderfully crafted and helped immerse you into the the story...to be honest the whole visual package immersed you.

THE PLOT...
itself was well paced.  It did not feel drawn out one bit, was easy to follow, and filled with nice details.  No real surprises, but the dramatic impact was there.  I also want to pay a special note to the romantic elements.  I can't quite explain it, but this one developed it nicely.  It did not feel contrived at all.

THE MUSICAL...
numbers were also fitting and well placed.  Sometimes, when it comes to musicals, there's at least one number that just doesn't jive with the rest.  What really worked here was the fact that though all the musical numbers were unique enough from each other, they still had a common thread in the styling and orchestration that kept them all feeling like they were still from the same movie/era/etc.  Also, the songs were really wonderful...some of the best non-disney movie pieces I've heard.

THE SPECIAL FEATURES...
were the only disappointing thing about this film.  A lot of the special features are text based reading things...but the ""forgotten forest"" set of features is nice because of the interviews and in depth video/audio explanations of the production process.  Apart from that, there wasn't much for me.

[""CATS CAN'T DANCE""]:
This is by far the strongest of the movie set and features some of the most relatable and touching animal characters in any film.  This type of underdog (er...undercat?) tale has been told time and time again...yet, there's a special kind of magic and charm with this one that just touches you.  On the surface, this tale is about a cat that just wants to do what he loves and follow his dream.  Easy enough, right?  But if you dig deeper, you discover that this is a struggle that we all go through.  We all have hopes and dreams.  Especially when we are starting out, we just want to bring some magic to life so to speak.  But then we are hit with something called ""reality"" and our fairytales are dashed.  But then comes the question, who is actually seeing life FOR REAL?  In the words of G.K. Chesterton, ""Fairyland is nothing but the sunny country of common sense"", and ""The point is not that this world is too sad to love or too glad not to love; the point is that when you do love a thing, its gladness is a reason for loving it, and its sadness a reason for loving it more.""  And this film really captures (quite literally at times) these theme well.

THE ANIMATION...
for this film is especially jaw dropping.  Not only are there epic camera angles, they use lighting intentionally and to great effect.  Not just this, but they also feature so many witty and smart parodies of the 1930 & 40s Hollywood culture of the time...as well as mimicking some of the animation styles of the day.  At times, it brought me back to the golden era of hollywood (I love classic films), other times it reminded me of the days of the Tex Avery/Looney Toons animated shorts.  And it does all this with a visual class you can't help but love.

THE PLOT...
is simple and won't surprise you...but it flows very well and can be quite touching.  The execution, the dialogue, the interaction was just really well done.

THE MUSICAL...
numbers are top notch and catchy, as well.  I loved how its jazz and gospel feel...and they used some very smart musical quotes, too!  This is one soundtrack I really want to get.  The other best part is that they flow with each other.  The sound like they are coming from the same film/era/etc.  Finally, they really work what is happening really well, too.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
There are ""normal"" features and DVD-rom features.  I haven't tried the DVD-ROM stuff, yet so I can't comment on that.  But as to the normal features...the only thing that interested me was the songbook.  Apart from that, the features are kinda lacking and I think they could have done so much more with it.

[ALL IN ALL]
I bought this set only because I was having a bad day and it was in the bargain bin...but this more than made up for my experiences of the day.  It brought much needed food for thought, inspiration, and encouragement.  Not only that, but had some real serious laughing moments haha.  I am so surprised that these films aren't as well known.  Honestly, they don't make such heartfelt animated features with this kind of class as often, now.  These are truly hidden gems, and I do hope that you will be able to experience this as well.",1417651200,,7197,4.651587301587302
