7881879,5,6305067678,"HI All:

This movie is available on youtube (shush!)
This film is one of my favorites -- right up there with ""12 Angry Men"" and the ""Ox-Bow Incident"".
Ginger Coffey is  an Irish immigant to Canada an ""everyman""  a ""loser"" hopelessly lost in denial - following his dream of being a writer for a newspaper. He cares not a wit for this wife and child so intense is he on his illusions. Does all this sound familar?- It does to me!
Ginger is played perfectly by Robert Shaw who if you dont' recall has had some great roles  such as;

(1)  A Man for all Seasons - King Henry the 8th
(2) Jaws - as Quint the sea captain in Jaws who delivers one of the greates monologues ever

I usually weep during the final scene between Robert Shaw and Mary Are who play Ginger Coffey and his wife Vera.

7881880,5,6305067678,"""The Luck of Ginger Coffey"" stars real-life couple Robert Shaw and Mary Ure as Irish immigrants in Montreal. A simple story of luck, love and tough times, Shaw especially gives a phenomenal performance as the  somewhat escapist Coffey. Though the film's sound quality is somewhat  lacking (you can't even understand the French Canadians speaking English!)  this is an excellent film for students and fans of Shaw.",937699200,9,413,5.2272727272727275
