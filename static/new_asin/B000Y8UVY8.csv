It's a great film and is meant to focus on Jackson's Christian faith. That's not bias, that was the whole point of the film!",1217376000,8,386,4.938461538461539
3017452,3,B000Y8UVY8,"This film is pretty well done, as far as cinematography and general historical content. It does a good job of exploring early influences, particularly in childhood, on Jackson's religious and world views.

In focusing so heavily on Jackson's religion, however, the filmmakers reveal their bias -- and biased filmmaking is known to overlook inconvenient facts or storylines that don't mesh as well. Such as Jackson's intensive study of Catholicism while living in Mexico during the Mexican War; Jackson seriously considered becoming a Catholic, and spent many hours of study and conversation with a bishop, yet no mention of this no-doubt formative encounter is mentioned in this film. The audience cannot help but notice other facts that are as conspicuous as this, and are urged to read Robertson's excellent biography instead of viewing this.

History aside, the cinematography is decent, but not great. There's lots of unidentified scenery (and I mean LOTS of grass waving in the wind, and tree branches swaying in the wind, and clouds moving in the  wind...).",1217203200,4,1063,5.241176470588235
3017453,4,B000Y8UVY8,"Still Standing is the most recent production from Franklin Springs Family Media. It tells the story of Stonewall Jackson, not primarily through his experience as a soldier, but through the legacy of his faith. With much of the story being told by historians, it describes him not just a military genius (which is certainly his legacy in history) but as a made of resolute Christian character. It takes the viewer from his orphaned childhood, through the Sunday school class he taught for African Americans, and into the Civil War where he played a pivotal role in the initial successes of the Confederacy. Shot in a variety of relevant historical locales, the production gives the viewer a sense of where Jackson lived and what his life might have been like. It certainly provides a challenge to understand the faith that made Jackson who he was.",1200960000,11,846,4.881944444444445
3017454,5,B000Y8UVY8,"This wonderful DVD is based on the critically acclaimed book by noted VA historian Richard G. Williams Jr. His study, titled ""Stonewall Jackson: The Black Man's Friend,"" re-opened the door to a part of Jackson's legacy that is far too often forgotten - the story of his Sunday School for both freed and slave blacks. As a fellow Jackson biographer, I was very interested in seeing how the panoramic cinematography that Franklin Springs is known for, would match up with the insightful narrative based on the text of Mr. Williams. Wow!

I must say that I am very impressed, not only with the scenes that fill the screen with glorious images of Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley, but also with the wonderful commentary that is interwoven by noted historians James I. ""Bud"" Robertson Jr., Dr. George Grant, William Potter, Virginia Military Institute Col. Keith Gibson; and Francis Lightburn Cressman -- great granddaughter of Civil War Union General Joseph Lightburn -- among others. It is a feast for both the eyes and mind.

The overall storyline of Jackson's life is familiar, but what makes this documentary special is the particular focus on his religious piety and evangelical efforts on behalf of the African-American population in Lexington Virginia. Throughout the film we are told the stories of a young Tom Jackson growing up amongst slaves in Jackson's Mill and his particular fondness for them as an adult. We are also told about the special relationship that he shared with his personal body servant and cook Jim Lewis. Truly Jackson was more than just a Confederate General; he was a paternal deliverer of black literacy, and instrumental in planting the seeds for eternal salvation in the slave and freed members of his Colored Sabbath School. Four churches sprung from this foundation and most are still operating today.

Tender footage of a recent reunion and church service that was attended by descendents from both the original African congregation and Jackson family reinforce the notion of faith crossing the racial divide for generations to come. Clearly Jackson's evangelical mission is validated even today. It's a touching story to say the least and will appeal to a wide audience of both Civil War enthusiasts and Christians. It's the kind of inspirational film that should be shared, and I can see a wonderful opportunity for Bible studies and church retreats using this as part of their curriculum.

Bonus features include an interview with the author Richard G. Williams Jr. as well as comments by award-winning director Ken Carpenter, who openly admits the controversial nature of this subject. Still, I challenge any nay Sayers to watch the film and judge for themselves. My conclusion is that there were over 100 souls that were saved by the kindness, compassion, and convictions of Thomas Jonathan Jackson. That's over 100 new Christians in the Kingdom, who may have never been introduced to the teachings of their Savior if not for the ministry of the general.

I highly recommend this piece to Bible study groups, churches, and heritage organizations. I also urge parents to share this insightful and inspirational story with their children, as this side of `Stonewall's' life is most likely ignored in the classroom.",1195084800,28,3253,5.084269662921348

8231295,4,B000Y8UVY8,"Stonewall Jackson was a Confederate and as African American, that makes me uneasy. So imagine my surprise to learn what Jackson did for my people in the state of Virgina. Jackson was special because while he fought for the South, he was progressive (for a man of his time) when it came to race. This DVD gives us a history of Jackson's life and his evolution as a man of God. It also discuss his relationship with his two wives, how his mother's death affected him and his love for children.

However this DVD missed the boat on so many levels. First of all, the video spent too much time showing us Virgina's landscape. Once you see the video, you will know what I am talking about.  Also, near the end it showed a reunion of religious leaders, family of Jackson, and descendants of free and enslaved blacks that Jackson helped, fellowship together at a church. Why in the world did the producers not interview some of the people to get their perspective of Jackson? Also the producers stayed away from discussing what historians and medical experts believe were symptoms of Jackson's autism, which may explain some of Jackson's strange ways.

The video does offer a surpise when discussing the relationship between Jackson and Lewis (his black servant). Jackson and Lewis had a disagreement over which horse Jackson was to ride into battle on. The argument became so heated, harsh words were exchanged until Jackson backed down and agreed that Lewis was right. If you read anything about Jackson, you would know Jackson never backed down from a confrontation with any man(read about his relationship with General AP Hill). However, he backed down and listened to Lewis. LOL

I don't know if this DVD is worth the price, but it tells an interesting story about one of our greatest generals and tries to seperate the warrior and reveal the real man...Thomas Jackson.",1239148800,14,1866,4.785714285714286
