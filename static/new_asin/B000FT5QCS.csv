8126281,3,B000FT5QCS,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films that have no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on their back covers. Audio levels are superb, some of the highest distortion-free sound you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

In this DIGIVIEW volume, ""Tell-Tale Heart"" shows persistent scratch lines fpr several minutes and has at least one minor edit gap while ""Chiller"" lacks color vibrancy.

TELL-TALE HEART - Authentic costuming and sets add nicely to this Poe adaptation about an introverted man who falls for a flower shop girl living across the street from his large empty house. He introduces her to his best friend but jealousy soon leads to murder.
