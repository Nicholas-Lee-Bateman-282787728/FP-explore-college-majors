8462343,4,B0058YPHVA,"This series was one of the television programs set in the 1960's riding the popularity of Mad Men. Initially, I thought of it as just a knock-off of the former, something trying to tap into that same feeling of nostalgia, but as I watched I realized there was more to it than just a wannabe clone.

It brought together interesting characters, every person (that's right, not just Bunnies) who might need a fresh start, money from high tippers, or just someplace who accepted them.

The show was a grand experiment, and if it rested on its own merits the program would certainly have been renewed, but it seemed that even in an America over 50 years removed from the obscenity scandals of ""nude"" women being shown in magazines the self-appointed moral guardians of our nation still snarl at the Playboy name. Not only was the show not given a full season, but so harsh was the conservative backlash that the remaining episodes remain unaired to this day.

I'll never say this was a great show, but it was certainly a good one. But the saddest part? While this show may have little to do with the founder of Playboy himself, a half century has gone by and it feels as if the United States is still vilifying Hugh Hefner and his ideas about sexuality.",1495929600,2,1248,4.5625
