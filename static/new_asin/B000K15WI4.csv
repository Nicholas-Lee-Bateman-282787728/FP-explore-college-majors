8153786,1,B000K15WI4,"This conversation with Charlie Rose and Ronald Lauder was very enlightening. I will use it in a class on ""Jews on Trial"" where I will discuss the Adele Boch-Bauer Affair. I am sure the group will find it very intersting. I learned some things I didn't know even though I had researched the matter.",1350864000,,297,4.518518518518518
8153787,4,B000K15WI4,"Rose interviews Ronald Lauder about his purchase of the Gustav Klimnt painting for one- hundred and thirty- five million dollars, the most ever paid for a single work of art. Lauder describes the painting in detail and tells the story of its purchase. Lauder is one of the great art- collectors and he tells of how he from an early age was deeply connected to turn- of- the century Vienese Art.  We learn too much about the painting itself, its subject, and 'Neue' Museum which it is placed in in New York's Museum Row.
All this is fine, but I felt many things were not asked which should have been. One such question has to do with Lauder's current business, another with his Jewish communal work and leadership. Another set of questions would have to do with justifying paying so much money for a painting when the money might have been used for some charitable purpose. Yet other questions might relate to whether Lauder was not in fact hyping the value of the work and the artist. Klimnt is no Rembrandt and not even Van Gogh or Chagall. Is his place in the History of Art anywhere near the significance of Cezanne's or Manet's? Isn't the whole story one of inflating the value of the work , and imposing the fiscal judgment upon the aesthetic?
Both Lauder and Rose are commended for the generally intelligent way they spoke about the work of art itself.
However we should have been given a deeper knowledge of Lauder in this interview.",1193097600,,1440,4.5813953488372094
