3145638,5,B0015LPRP6,I received this DVD in the mail yesterday and watched it twice last night.  The first time I really watched the musicians and the second time I just thoroughly enjoyed the music.  I lived in NYC in the Village in the sixties and I wish there was such a group as this.  If you have Irish history this is a god-send.  Thank you.,1388448000,6,326,4.126984126984127
3145639,5,B0015LPRP6,My husband is IRISH and though he has lived in New Zealand for many years ;he said it was like being at a concert in Ireland and he enjoyed it very much. Great music and i would recommend this dvd,1384646400,7,196,3.925
3145640,5,B0015LPRP6,Provides a nice representation of the best of American musicians playing Irish Traditional Music.  They had a hoot creating this DVD and the joy of the music shows.,1383004800,7,164,4.857142857142857
3145641,5,B0015LPRP6,Lots of good music. Made me proud of my Irish heritage. I plan to show it to some of my Irish friends and then to give it to my son and his family.,1371945600,8,147,3.484848484848485
3145642,5,B0015LPRP6,"Bought this to take to an Irish friend.  WE played it at his St. Pat's party and everyone loved it, especially the little 80+ lady dancer!",1364774400,7,138,4.3076923076923075
3145643,4,B0015LPRP6,"The musical talent showcased in this DVD is well worth the money.  The venue is casual, but the music is very good; it's well worth seeing again (and again).  Amazon.com has been excellent in providing the music - especially Irish music - that I wanted.",1320624000,4,253,4.6
3145644,4,B0015LPRP6,"This video would more aptly be sub-titled ""The Green Fields Of America"" or ""Mick Moloney and Friends"". The actual title doesn't adequately identify who is doing what here. The DVD has no liner notes, and the on-screen menus have only a rudimentary mention of leading performers. In order to figure out who all the musicians were in each set, I tried to memorize faces from the opening scenes, and pieced them in the order they appeared in each song/tune. This show will please many fans of several Irish-American musicians. In #9, you see three founding members of Solas.

In order to figure out the names of the songs/tunes, I had to consult the CD music album from this show. I'm still not sure if the names are accurate; Joannie Madden introduces #7 as ""The Girl With Brown Hair"".

 Here is a break-down, of the core program.
1-McNally's Row Of Flats (Green Fields Of America) 2-Fiddle Extravaganza: Never Was Piping So Gay / The Chandelier / Paddy Fahey's [Liz Carroll, Eileen Ivers, Athena Tergis, John Doyle] 3-A Tune with The Mighty Raff [Mike Rafferty, Billy McComiskey, Brendan Dolan] 4-The Green Hills Of Tyrol / Fermoy Lasses / Pinch Of Snuff [Seamus Egan, Eileen Ivers, John Doyle] 5-The Flower Of Kilkenny [Robbie O'Connell (vocals, guitar), Mick Moloney (mandolin), Athena Tergis (violin), Tim Collins (whistle), Billy McComiskey (accordian), John Doyle (bouzouki), Brendan Dolan (piano) 6-Kitty O'Neill's Champion Jig [Athena Tergis, Niall O'Leary, Brendan Dolan] 7-The House In The Glen / The Bohola Jig / Josie McDermott's /Free And Easy [Joannie Madden (whistle & flute), Liz Carroll & Eileen Ivers (violins), Seamus Egan (banjo), Jerry O'Sullivan (uilleann pipes), Billy McComiskey (accordian), John Doyle (guitar), Brendan Dolan (piano)] 8-Planxty Miss Maxwell [Eileen Ivers (violin), Joannie Madden (whistle), Mick Moloney (banjo), Athena Tergis (violin), Tim Collins (concertina), Billy McComiskey (accordian), Liz Carroll (violin), Jerry O'Sullivan (uillean pipes), Brendan Dolan (piano)] 9-The King's Schilling [Karan Casey, John Doyle, Seamus Egan] 10-Before The Storm / The Black Rogue / The Lass Of Ballintra / The High Reel [Joannie Madden, Liz Carroll, John Doyle] 11-Lark In The Morning / Cannabhan Ban / Humours Of Ballyloughlin [Joannie Madden, Liz Carroll, Eileen Ivers, Seamus Egan, Tim Collins, Jerry O'Sullivan, John Doyle] 12-Fair London Town [Seamus Egan (flute), Joannie Madden (whistle), Rhys Jones (guitar), Susan McKeown (vocals), Athena Tergis (violin), Tim Collins (concertina), John Doyle (guitar)] 13-Jim O'Keefe's / The Clog / The Star Above The Garter / The Hare In The Corn [Eileen Ivers & Liz Carroll (violins), Mick Moloney (banjo), Athena Tergis (violin), Jerry O'Sullivan (uillean pipes), Tim Collins (concertina), Billy McComiskey (accordian), John Doyle (guitar), Seamus Egan (flute), Joannie Madden (flute), Brendan Dolan (piano)] 14-The Trip To Parliament / The Torn Jacket 15-The Leaving Of Liverpool [lead vocalists: Robbie O'Connell, Mick Moloney, Karan Casey, Susan McKeown)]

*There are some bonus performances, not mentioned here.

I cannot find enough of Eileen Ivers anywhere to satiate me. But this show was a good taste. I hope someday to hear ""The Secret Life Of Eileen Ivers"", which would include performances with Cherish The Ladies, The Green Fields Of America, Paddy A Go Go, Riverdance, Hall & Oates, and some recent Immigrant Soul. &iquest;How about it, Eileen?",1306540800,23,3435,5.425093632958801

Talent through the roof, beautifully shot and woven together with the priceless academic and experiential guidance of Mick Maloney, who has both decades of experience playing and singing Irish music around the world, as well as a Ph. D from Penn in Irish folklore and music. Spectacular performances by Karan Casey, Athena Tergis, Liz Carroll, Seamus Egan, Robbie O'Connell, John Doyle, Joanie Madden, Susan McKeown, and many more.
