Especially since season one of the series is available on HULU in a high quality re-mastered form. For the most enjoyable experience see it on HULU.",1353024000,,266,4.804347826086956
8347492,5,B001WIPB9Y,"This was a great classic show that should have lasted more than a couple of seasons, sure there were a few corny episodes but for the most it was good entertainment all the way around, back then you could actually let your kids sit around and watch TV and they could get a good clean message from it... now in my opinion TV shows are just ""dumbing"" down our kids (and adults)
THANK YOU TRUCKERFLICKS!! You did a good job bringing this show back to all of us who have wanted to see it again for 35 years.. BRAVO!!",1250121600,9,512,4.181818181818182
