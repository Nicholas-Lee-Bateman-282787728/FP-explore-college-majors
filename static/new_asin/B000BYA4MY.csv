2446183,5,B000BYA4MY,"My wife loves murder mysteries, especialy BBC. As her husband I have to admit I enjoyed this set also. We stay away from shows that feature sex and graphic violence as well as swearing. This show was fun to watch. Les",1353715200,,217,4.317073170731708
2446184,4,B000BYA4MY,"This is a very enjoyable series--it is a mystery series,without all the violence etc..and just proves what an all round actress she is--after watching her all the years as Hyacinth Bucket....it is refreshing",1282694400,5,207,5.303030303030303
2446185,5,B000BYA4MY,"Hetty Wainthropp Investigates is a charming bit of British television.  Patricia Routledge is a motherly-type investigator who always gets to the bottom of a case, in spite of her husband and younger partner.  The plots are good and the acting even better.  If you love British television, you'll love this series.",1273708800,4,314,5.117647058823529
2446186,5,B000BYA4MY,"Yes, I love Hetty and as soon as Acorn releases a new set I am the first in line to buy it.  So...I have purchased my new Series III and I love it.  Three volumes (disks) and nine new episodes.

This set includes:

1/ All Stitched Up -- When a delinquent terrorizes a neighborhod, the police are helpless as frightened victims refuse to testify against him.  Posing as the Irish sister-in-law of one of the residents Hetty infiltrates the local quilting circle to get the lowdown.  Di's comment: Only Hetty could infiltrate a quilting circle.

2/ Daughter of the Regiment -- A military wife hires Hetty to identify a mysterious photographer who is stalking the woman's daughter. Tipped that an Australian is involved Hetty and Geoffry go undercover as 'Aussies'.  Di's Comment. One of my favorites, stars Mel Martin.

3/ Serving the Community -- A leader in the local (jacket says 'Indian', but I believe they were Pakistani immigrants and their families) recruits Hetty to investigate a string of muggings and then Hetty herself is mugged! The plot thickens when Robert becomes the recipient of stolen goods.

4/ Fisticuffs -- After a minor fender-bender involving two women, one lets the other have it and zips off in her red Alfa Romeo. The battered victim as Hetty to help her identify her assailant. Geoffrey tracks down the Alfa and meets Janet, the mechanic who has been working on the car.

5/ Childsplay -- A quick visit to relatives turns into a longer stay for Hetty when her young nephew gets expelled from school for drug possession.  Hetty enlists Geoffrey to infiltrate a suspicious gang led by a schoolyard bully named Bomber.

6/ Pursuit by Proxy -- Hetty is hired to track down a bankrupt furniture owner.  The job is complicated by her meddling brother-in-law, Frank, who has come to stay and insists on ""helping"" the agency while Robert is away visiting their son in Australia.

7/ A Minor Operation -- Hetty is in the hospital recovering from surgery on her varicose veins. Meanwhile DCI Adams is keeping an eye on an ailing prisoner.  Hetty goes into action from her hospital bed when the DCI is accused of sexual harrassment.

8/ Helping Hansi -- A German pensioner asks Hetty to track down his sister,whom he last saw during the war when she was escaping to England. When Hetty visits Hansi in the nursing home, she discovers he is being cruelly taunted by the other residents.

9/ How Time Flies -- Frank finally takes his leave and treats Hetty to a day out at a local steam railway museum as a parting gift.  A frantic call makes it a working trip.",1137196800,43,2575,4.707589285714286

2446191,4,B000BYA4MY,"Once again we are treated to the brilliant Patricia Routledge as the tough Lancashire amateur sleuth Hetty Wainthropp in the longest series of this shows run.  There are a few shake-ups to the Wainthropp Detective Agency that make for some interesting sub-plots running through most of this series.  We are introduced to the tom-boy mechanic Janet who will eventually become Jeff's girlfriend in the episode ""Fisticuffs"".  In the next episode ""Childsplay"" , after two series of using a borrowed scooter, Jeff has gotten an old but reliable car for him and Hetty.  Halfway through this series Hetty's husband Robert goes to Australia to visit their son and is replaced (sort-of) by his quirky brother Frank, who does little but get on Hetty and Jeff's nerves even when he is doing his best to help them.
This time, the cases are made a little more serious than they have been in the past and somewhat more complicated.  The show's tendency toward subplots (or even dual plots) is more pronounced in this series than ever.  Hetty still insists on dealing with human interest cases of little interest to the police (though there is much more assistance by the recurring character of DCI Adams than in the last two series).  Hetty and Jeff face a good deal more danger of physical brutality in this series than in the past.  The cases run the gamut this time from vandalism in a neighborhood in ""All Stitched Up"" to a school-yard drug dealing ring that implicates Hetty's great-nephew in ""Childsplay"", to muggings in an Indian neighborhood in ""Serving the Community"", to home break-ins of hospital patients in ""A Minor Operation"".  My personal favorite episode is ""How Time Flies"" where Hetty helps a quirky, clock-obsessed former bank employee who believes a priceless clock he repaired has been stolen by the men who brought it to be fixed.
The cases are still highly original and interesting, Patricia Routledge and Dominick Monaghan are still the most unlikely of fruitful partnerships, and the show is in fine fettle as it sadly winds down to it's last series...",1405123200,,2063,4.922190201729107
2446192,3,B000BYA4MY,"I really loved series one and two, but this one seemed to be lacking something.  The episodes just did not hold my interest like the first two series.  Should I order series four?  I'll let you know.",1392163200,,199,4.324324324324325
2446193,5,B000BYA4MY,"Senior citizen Hetty is determined to account for more than wrinkles. She and spouse, Robert, always in love, sometimes testy begin a detective agency. Robert visits their son in Australia during several of this season's episodes. Geoffrey continues to help get into mystery adventures as a part of the spy business. He falls in love. Hetty loathes unfairness. She wants to straighten out others' lives. Crime without gritty, dark, bloody scenes, but it does have the rare course word and one illegal drug situation.
