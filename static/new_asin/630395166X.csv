7856705,5,630395166X,"As a devout fan of PSME, I was disappointed to know that there were only six episodes. The series is far too complex to be consensed so much! But, nevertheless, I bought it and I loved it. I fell in love with the bratty Rin, the gender-confused Issei, the nitpicky Sakura (who resembles me in more ways than one), and even the hard-headed Jinpachi. Haruhiko/Shukaido was very well done! His heavy heart was transferred to screen seamlessly (for what the short series allowed). I laughed, I cried, I did that thing where you laugh and cry at the same time! I was touched very deeply. For any reader of shoujo manga (female-based/emotion-based comics) this is a MUST HAVE!
This is about the DVD version.",1075161600,2,701,4.661290322580645
7856706,5,630395166X,"PSME is definitely one of the three best anime shows I have seen (and I have seen easily over 200).  It combines beautiful character design with a complex storyline that makes you have to really think.  Also used is a  brilliant classical music score by Yoko Kanno that matches the thoughtful  mood of the show perfectly.  With the DVD containing all 6 episodes of the  series being released by VIZ on 6/27/00 (containing both the original  Japanese voices subbed in English and the English dubbed version), there is  absolutely no reason for any anime sci-fi drama fan to pass up buying this  one!",956361600,2,598,4.728155339805825
7856707,5,630395166X,"One of the most incredible anime I have ever watched. It's hard to convey in words how good it is..from the perfect cliffhanger ending on each episode, to the refreshing maturity of its plot, and even to probably the  best esper battle ever made on anime, Please Save my Earth is a definite  must-own. There are only two regrets...that the ending episode didn't tie  things up as much as it could, and that amazon.com says it's unavaliable  for sale. Hopefully someone will rerelease it on dvd (hint hint Viz video)",947462400,2,515,4.688888888888889
