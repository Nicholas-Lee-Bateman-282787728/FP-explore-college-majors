6050569,5,B00G3BRCBU,As an old western TV fan these episodes are great to watch and bring back many childhood memories. It makes  great addition to my collection.,1397520000,2,141,4.64

6050571,5,B00G3BRCBU,This has been a long time coming. I remember well the TV series in my younger days. It was such a pleasure to see it again. The DVD is great and the delivery was very fast.,1389830400,7,172,3.8055555555555554
6050572,5,B00G3BRCBU,"In comparing the two Warner westerns that alternated with each other, Sugarfoot and Cheyenne, I don't believe I had ever realized before how much the producers adhered to the contrasts between the two characters.

The two heroes are not clones.
Cheyenne will solve a problem when he has no choice, with a gun. Sugarfoot is steadfastly against using guns to settle situations. I was surprised at how much he refuses to wear guns throughout the first two years of the series.

By the way, the aforementioned Sugarfoot  Volume 2 that has Will Hutchins's autograph also has the first three appearances of Sugarfoot's bad-guy cousin, the Canary Kid. Montgomery Pittman wrote and/or also directed those episodes. Pittman also has Chris Colt make guest star appearances from his own Colt .45 series in those episodes of Sugarfoot.  Characters crossing over from one series to another were rare in those days.

Somehow, Montgomery Pittman always seemed to be able to do a little more than many  the other talent behind the camera, as writer and director.

The prints are complete except for the BUMPERS and TRAILERS.  Warner Archives knows I'm not about to forget that fact.  But the shows are otherwise complete, the prints as good as I've ever seen, if not better.

You can read more about Cheyenne and Sugarfoot up on my Riding Shotgun column at [...]",1389052800,13,1346,4.915929203539823

6050574,5,B00G3BRCBU,I have always loved Westerns growing up and I still do today but the ones they bring out now are not worth watching.,1387843200,15,116,4.086956521739131
6050575,5,B00G3BRCBU,WILL HUTCHINS IS SUCH A GREAT ACTOR. HIS SHOW  TEACHES VALUES AS DOES CHEYENNE AND BRONCO. THEY ALL INSPIRE  VIEWERS TO  OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE  PUNISHMENT  OF DOING  CRIMES IS ENFORCED BY THEM AS LAWMEN. I THINK CHILDREN WOULD WATCH THE HEROES IN THESE MOVIES.,1386201600,18,272,4.448979591836735
6050576,5,B00G3BRCBU,"Sugarfoot season 1 is brilliant, top quality picture and sound. I have season 2 in the post and hope it will arrive in the next couple of days. Iam looking foreward very much to watching season 2. I also have Cheyenne season 7 in the post . when this arrives i will have all the seasons of cheyenne. guess what i will be watching over christmas!!!!!!! I also have the first two seasons of Maverick another brilliant series. I just hope WB. bring out Bronco and Lawman. can amazon contact WB to see what is happening with these series?",1384300800,21,534,4.404040404040404
6050577,5,B00G3BRCBU,"I knew Sugarfoot was a great show before I purchased it, and could not wait to see it again. My fellow Sugarfoot fans, I purchased a show I had not seen for at least fifty two years becauase just like you, I know Sugarfoot is a great show. I can now watch Season 2 any time I wish. Thank you Amazon.

In my opinion Will Hutchings is perfect for the  role of Sugarfoot. Sugarfoot fans, through out the world, Australian's saw Will Hutchins for the first time in the early 1960's. Sugarfoot was aired on Saturday Afternoon once every three weeks, on the alternative Saturday's Australian's had the opportunity to watch Cheyenne and Bronco another great TV show yet to be released.

Sugarfoot Fans, I own all Six Seasons of Cheyenne and can't wait for Season 7 to be released. Just like Cheyenne, I think that anybody who grew up watching Sugarfoot, once they know the DVD's are on sale, will buy the product.

On another note, while Amazon has Sugarfoot Season 2 available for sale, I notice Season 1 is not available for sale.  So, I was wondering if Amazon could purchase it from Warner Brothers and then on-sell it to their International Customers? For I will buy Season 1 as soon as I know it is available.

In closing, I would ask all fans of Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, and lawman (another great TV show) to support this email and ask Amazon to use their influence in the market place to get all these shows released as soon as possible so together we can all can take a walk down memory lane and watch these great shows time and time again.

Thanking all the fans of these shows in advance.

6050608,5,B00G3BRCBU,"Sugarfoot is definitely a different type of western hero.  Doesn't always wear a revolver, although it's usually nearby.  Good stories.  We just love old westerns, and the Cheyenne trio (Cheyenne, Bronco, and Sugarfoot) are our favorites.",1428883200,,238,5.555555555555555

6050610,5,B00G3BRCBU,This was a fun series with good plots and grear acting by the star.  This TV series did not resemble the Randolph Scott movie of the same name.  Warner Bros. used a number of titles from their movie vault and created some very entertaining TV shows.  I recommend this quality series for your collection.,1424304000,,303,4.574074074074074

6050614,5,B00G3BRCBU,"I'm not sure what happened to the First Season. I always remembered Sugarfoot, because I enjoyed his shows as well as Maverick and Cheyenne shows back in the 60's.  I still remember these shows when I got out of school and rushed home and they were on TV.  So they might have been syndicated back then.  I just know I enjoyed watching all of these fore-mentioned westerns. The DVD set is well done, and I can't remember any blemishes from the reproduction process.  If you are interested in the series and don't remember Sugarfoot was a correspondence school lawyer and sometimes taking small menial tasks as he earned his degree. Some of the episodes he's always borrowing law books or studying with judges to learn his craft which makes it an interesting show at times. But in many occasions he still needs a quick draw of his gun to get himself out of trouble!",1422316800,,863,4.584415584415584

6050628,5,B00G3BRCBU,"At last we are getting some of the best of the old T.V. series released on DVD.  Sugarfoot was a favorite of mine when I was a kid.  He always figured out a way to outsmart the bad guy(s) without always resorting to violence or killing as was the norm rather than the exception in later T.V. western series.  So far I have ordered all four released seasons from a source other than amazon and at a much better price.  Also have all seasons of Cheyenne and all released to date seasons of Bronco.  Glad younger members of my family will be able to enjoy these old shows as did I when they were on.  These shows sure beat to heck anything that any studio has been putting out for a number of years.  Unfortunately, sans only a very few exceptions, good, quality and entertaining family T.V. viewing has definitely become a thing of the past.",1416182400,,839,4.339743589743589

8620334,5,B00G3BRCBU,"I grew up watching the westerns during the sixties and seventies and it wasn't until recently that I discovered the Warner Brothers classics of Cheyenne, Bronco and Sugarfoot.  I've seen so many westerns, but this is a standout for me. Will Hutchins is perfect as Tom Brewster and you just can't help loving him. He goes out of his way to help everyone, even at his own peril, and his boyish good looks and charming ways makes Sugarfoot the most memorable cowboy of all time. I love all the episode which are filled with outstanding guest stars and fun plots that the entire family can enjoy. You'll find yourself smitten with this good-looking, fun-loving, cattle ropin Sugarfoot.!",1492992000,,682,4.829059829059829

8620338,4,B00G3BRCBU,"Perhaps because of his easygoing, aw-shucks demeanor, many folks dismiss Tom Brewster (Will Hutchins) as a sugarfoota step down from a tenderfoot.  But Tom is very nearly a native WesternerI was born near Woodstock, Vermont, he says, but my folks moved to Oklahoma when I was just a toddler, and there he grew up; in the first season of his adventures (which for reasons unclear isn't available through Amazon, though it can be had at various other online retailers) its established that his father became a peace officer of some renown.  By the time he was 15 Tom had learned how to handle a gun if somebody made you use it, and hes still pretty good with one, though he often doesnt bother to wear it, and a fierce fist fighter at need besides.  But his dream is to be a lawyer, to which end hes taking correspondence coursesa couple of times we find him riding along with a thick lawbook spread over his saddlefork, once even reading aloud from it to help his memoryand he prefers to use words and wits to get himself and others out of trouble.  And trouble he finds, frequently, as he drifts about the West, working sometimes in town, sometimes on the range, and sometimes at mining operations.  The very first episode of these 20 (featuring in heavy roles John Russell, who a year or so hence would begin a stint as Laramie City Marshal Dan Troop on the Warner oater Lawman, and Edward (later known as Edd) Byrnes, who would gain fame as Kookie on 77 Sunset Strip) finds him teamed with a crusty desert oldster whos determined to lead to their deaths the stage robbers who killed his homeward-bound, newly-minted-doctor son.  The second introduces Cully Abbott, who was Toms best friend for seven of his boyhood years and is now out of prison on parole; like several segments of Warners Cheyenne, it turns on the motif of betrayal by someone you trust.  Three segmentsincluding one that involves Tom with a mesmerist and a girl who supposedly goes into a trance and sees the future, and a second centering on a supposedly haunted housewere penned by Catherine Kuttner, better known as sf-and-fantasy writer C. L. Moore.  Hutchins twice appears in a dual role as Tom and his cousin, Abram Thomas, alias The Canary Kid, an outlaw who first assumes Toms place in order to spy out a target bank but finds himself beginning to like being legitimate.  Six months later, with Canary  in prison but his gang still on the loose, Tom is asked by government agent Christopher Colt (Wayde Preston of WBs Colt .45, which is just about the only Western series from the studio not yet available on DVD) to pose as his cousin and allow himself to be rescued while en route to another facility, so the gang and its accomplices can be nailed too.  Other guest stars include Allen Case (later The Deputy), Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Martin Landau, Tom Rettig (once best known as Lassies boy-master), Harold J. Stone, Roger Smith, John Carradine, Jack Kruschen, Abby Dalton, Adam West, Patricia Barry, Dennis Patrick, Joe deSantis, Fred Beir, Richard Long (later Jarrod Barkley on The Big Valley), Faith Domergue, Connie Stevens, Virginia Gregg, and two-times (in different roles) appearers R. G. Armstrong, Dorothy Provine, Don Dubbins, and Karl Swenson.

Although the first season seemed to be pretty consistently set circa 1881-2, this go-round begins the dating confusion common  to Golden Age TV Westerns.  In one episode, Juarez is President of Mexico; in another, its New Years Eve, Tom is on a St.-Louis-bound train not too far from the Mexican border (unlikely: except for a stub line or two out of Louisiana, Texas had very little trackage until the 1880s, and it took till 85 for the steel to reach Laredo on the Rio Grande), Maximilian was recently executed, and the Franco-Prussian War is raging; a third references a cache of rifles for the Juaristas.  All we can do is suppose that Tom (established in Brink of Fear as being about 25) is being followed through random adventures over an extended career.  Still, its an enjoyable series and Tom is a likeable hero with a real difference.",1440806400,,4080,4.757790368271955
