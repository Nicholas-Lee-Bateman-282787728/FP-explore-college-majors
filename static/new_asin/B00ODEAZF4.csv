The film is about a doctor with unpopular views on pregnancy and abortions, so stressed out by the current views of clients in his work, that he has turned to drugs, hookers, and a fantasy world as an escape. This particular intimate encounter with a hooker unexpectedly brings up old wounds, for both parties, and a secret that, once unleashed, brings both their worlds to a grinding halt.

I really enjoyed this movie. It actually got me caught up in it a few times to the point that I felt like I was watching someones life.
It wasn't perfect, as few indy films filmed in a weekend ever are, but it was still very well done!
