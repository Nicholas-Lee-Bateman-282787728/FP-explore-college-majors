8342956,1,B001U7B4VQ,"This is a 2009 release of a movie about a guy (Kumar Sahil) in love with a girl (Sneha Ullal, the Aishwarya look alike of Lucky: No time for Love) who he plans to marry. He is a photographer who goes to Mauritius for a shoot. A local girl (Sana Khan) gets a crush on him and starts stalking him and decides to oust the girlfriend. She seems on occasion to have some spooky destructive supernatural 'gifts' too (like dominating animals with a glance and exploding cakes with  a look)
The movie opens with us knowing there is a murderer on the loose in Mauritius and the culprit seems to be a psychopathic stalker girl... ! The local police,lead by Johnny Lever in makeup (and basically in drag!) run a 'comedic' subplot which is silly and unnecessary, are on the trail.
I found this really disengaging, patchy and poorly scripted. It was meant to be a vehicle for a new 'face' in Kumar Sahil. He is handsome enough in a male-model way but very inexperienced as an actor. He looked as if he was often enjoying himself but didn't seem to really connect emotionally with his supposed love. If I could make a comparison Harman Baweja was infinitely better in his first movies recently so I notice that inexperience doesn't need to mean this much rawness)
Sneha Ullal was doing the same pouty part she did in Lucky (where it worked better) I do wonder about someone making their career on the basis that they resemble someone else so closely. Why not use the real thing or find someone that adds something different?). She is fine overall however and the stalker girl gives the appropriate evil looks (and was vaguely like Jennifer Aniston in appearance!)
Kumar was dancing OK but the music didn't quite hit the spot. It looked like they were trying to emulate many familiar dance styles and didn't quite bring it off.
The opening number particularly was dominated by Western women trying to do hiphop/jazz/Indian moves. I really find this never works for me. Western women just seem more stilted and not as sensuous as the Indian women. Perhaps the Indians like the fairer skin and the way they seem happier to be more scantily clad that locals. As a Westerner though the Western women look amateurish and mar the overall effect. When you have the better product at home, why look elsewhere?
The scenery in Mauritius is beautifully caught and that's about it. Not a keeper.",1242259200,,2368,4.6380952380952385
