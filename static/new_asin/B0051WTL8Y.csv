8562216,5,B0051WTL8Y,I really enjoyed this flick. The DVD commentary mentions that it was originally planned to be a pilot for a possible TV series that would follow around the two main characters. I would certainly love to see some of the adventures that our leading man (Scott Schiaffo) and leading woman (Michelle Romani)would get themselves into.,1308873600,,329,5.0
