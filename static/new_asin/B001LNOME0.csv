8318997,4,B001LNOME0,A surprisingly good transfer. It's taken from an American International TV print and is slightly letterboxed (1.77). The image is mostly sharp and the color is very good. This DVD is far better in quality than most of the other Sword and Sandal films released here. The movie itself is a mishmash of history which involves Spartacus and Nero (huh?). Rock Stevens (aka Peter Lupus) makes for a likable and handsome hero. Also on hand are those two villainous genre regulars Massimo Serato and Livio Lorenzon. If you are a fan of Sword and Sandal films I recommend this DVD.,1448409600,2,572,4.73

8318999,3,B001LNOME0,"This is one of Peter Lupus' rarest sword-and-sandal movies to find, so I bought it. The print is faded with scratches and blemishes so it is going to look pretty lousy on your big-screen TV. Don't expect much in the way of audio/video or you will be sorely disappointed. [See the IMAGES section of this product for some screen grabs I posted]. Too bad, because in all honesty Mr. Lupus was in his prime here--he must have been training like a beast because his physique looks bigger and better than it did in ""Muscle Beach Party"" or ""Hercules and the Tyrants of Babylon"" and that's saying alot!",1387670400,6,594,4.5607476635514015
