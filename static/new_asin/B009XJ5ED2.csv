5371458,5,B009XJ5ED2,This was a great TV show and was cancelled. The pilot was not as good as the rest of the series and that could have been the reason that the show didn't get a good following.,1359504000,2,174,3.861111111111111
5371459,5,B009XJ5ED2,"Since this series was cancelled, I have been patiently waiting for this to come out.  Loved the deleted scenes and the gag reel at the end.  Thank you Amazon.  Keep up the good work.",1358899200,9,182,4.294117647058823
5371460,5,B009XJ5ED2,"First of all shopping on Amazon is the absolute best!  Excellent service every time!  This product on DVD, A Gifted Man is rivoting, great story line, clean, a sure recommend to people who want to watch an excellent medical true-to-life series with great actors!",1357776000,3,262,4.931818181818182
5371461,5,B009XJ5ED2,"First and foremost Patrick Wilson, the lead character, is a good actor and good looking as well. ALL the acting is top notch. Though the show has been cancelled, don't let that keep you from viewing the many episodes. There's an exciting energy in the show, and it's quite interesting to watch the various medical situations/emergencies. In that respect, the series is fairly educational. I found myself pausing and looking up various conditions that arise in Dr. Holt's medical practice. There's some social responsibility themes as well... the primary conflict is uptown neurologist Dr. Holt working vigorously in a free clinic in Spanish Harlem.

Did I mention that Patrick Wilson is good looking... a bit on the line of Paul Newman?",1355616000,,736,5.082644628099174
5371462,5,B009XJ5ED2,"Why is it that when a good show comes along, the ""numb nuts"" powers that be feel inclined to cancel it?  The series was well written and the acting by the major players was believeable.  It was also a show you could sit and watch and enjoy without hearing the ""F"" word used in nearly every sentence.  Has it gotten so bad that in today's society, people can't carry on a normal conversation without using the ""F"" word? Guess too that there wasn't enough T&A, sexually explicit and/or humping or biracial face sucking scenes to suit them.  Will they never learn that they don't need this type of content to produce a show that will be popular with the audience majority?  Any show that contains the elements described above is offensive to many, many people and is certainly not one that is suitable for family viewing.  I for one can't hit the remote fast enough when such a program comes on.  I'm not a prude but I for one am totally fed up with the trashy TV shows that are consistently being shoved in our faces each and every night.  That goes for the commercials too.

Listen up you dummies that cancelled this series.  There is a big audience out here that would like to see it back on the air!",1353196800,4,1200,4.389140271493213

5371465,1,B009XJ5ED2,"Could have been a great show...unfortunately it is a platform to push Shamanism. If you are a Christian, you will not like this show and you will not like the shamanistic rituals that are shown.  Christ is and always will be the One and Only Son of God. All will give an account for what they did with the sacrifice of Christ, whether they accepted him or rejected Him.",1444780800,,369,4.3478260869565215
5371466,2,B009XJ5ED2,"It's  a great  show. However,  there is some  fade out  and cut off on the sound . I wish better quality on that. I am disappointed  with the quality and flaws.",1438387200,,160,4.0
5371467,5,B009XJ5ED2,Loved this dvd and the series.  Should not have been canceled.,1425254400,,62,4.636363636363637
5371468,3,B009XJ5ED2,"TV series, in many/most genres HAVE gotten better over the ears. They have attracted better writers and actors, and the production values have generally become better. As good as ""A Gifted Man"" might be in many respects, it's still a medical based drama albeit with a few quirks.

Here's the scoop. (Possible spoiler alert!) Dr. Michael Holt is a gifted neurosurgeon with a high end practice in Manhattan. He runs into his ex-wife one night and engages in a nice conversation. When trying to contact her the next day he finds she's actually been dead for a couple of weeks. So how does a hard line scientific person reconcile ghostly visitations? She guides him to a free clinic she was working at and he finds himself re-examining his life.

This starts out well enough. Patrick Wilson does a good job as the ego inflated Holt. Jennifer Ehle is OK as his ex Anna Paul, though I do think she needs to dig deeper. The other actors do a fine job as well. You see where this is going fairly early on because he's someone who started out with less money and more empathy and maybe needs to readjust his path. This altering path is further emphasized by the introduction of a shaman (played by Pablo Schreiber) who attempts to show Holt that science isn't all there is to life. This is all well and good but a huge percentage of the scripts is devoted to various cases. Many are real bafflers a la ""House M.D."" so medical puzzle solving becomes the name of the game. Each episode does show Holt adjusting his metaphysical eyesight but he's still rather full of himself and it all takes back seat to the cases he's working on.

The first episodes are genuinely decent but when you hit episodes 7 and 8 they get pretty terrible. I didn't take note of who wrote which episodes but this has to come down to the writers. The dialogue is hackneyed and the cases not nearly as interesting as those before. I was streaming this so the luxury of weekly intervals goes out the window and the melodrama rears its ugly head as cheap devices show up all too regularly. For instance: Many of the cases come to a head while he is present to make a valiant effort to save the day. Life just isn't like that. Thank God not all his patients pull through. That would have been unbearable.

This is Okay. It has some really good stuff and some really bad stuff, but there are some decent life lessons to be learned. Watch it. But if it gets to be too much, don't hesitate to deep six it.",1424217600,,2462,4.428256070640177

5371471,5,B009XJ5ED2,The Gifted Man is such a great show. I can not believe it was canceled after 1 season. I had the Gifted man DVD playing and my son kept telling me that he could not believe this show was canceled. He  thought the same as I did that it it one of the best shows that was on TV.

5371488,1,B009XJ5ED2,"Sorry, I know a lot of people enjoyed this show, hope if you did you won't bother to read my review.
I suppose I should admit that I've spent years in medicine and that might bias my outlook on this show. I don't expect medical perfection but this stuff was soooooo far fetched it wasn't even funny, ok, sometime it was funny.
Ok, for the rest of it, the show has an amazing cast, that's what got me to watch it and keep watching in hopes that it would get better. I know as little about making movies as the writers of this show know about medicine so I can't say what exactly went wrong with the show but I don't think it was the acting.
The scenes go from one ridiculous emergency to another but for some reason I haven't been able to suspend my disbelief and get in to it, I feel like the transition between the emergencies are too abrupt and it feels totally fake, sort of like they had a quota of emergencies for the show. I don't often think about the background music but the sound track makes a huge difference and with this show the music just doesn't add to the story line, you know like music that makes your heart race during intense action, that sort of stuff.
I love the premise of the show, I love the actors, I watch and enjoy so many shows I know are not factual but for some reason the elements didn't come together so that I could suspend my rational thought and just enjoy the story.",1379894400,,1404,4.203703703703703

5371508,1,B009XJ5ED2,"An extremely skilled neurosurgeon is haunted by a deceased ex-wife who harasses him about how he should dedicate his life to the job she was doing before she died. It's never explained why this should make any kind of sense - just accept it and move on and watch how she menaces him into to sacrificing the care of his own patients and to instead see to her seemingly more deserving patients. Actually, pretty much all the recurring characters do the same. The people working at his ex-wife's inferior clinic treat him horribly - a bombardment of snide remarks and a showering of guilt - for what I don't know since it is never explained what he has done wrong or why he seemingly owes everybody or why people who can pay a doctor are worthy of hostility while those who can't are deserving of the best of the best literally because they don't have the money to pay for it. It's all too bizarre.

It's like the writers created a character to punish into submission and I have no doubt they made sure he submitted although I didn't watch past the second episode. It was just too sick to continue.

I enjoy interesting medical shows and was told if I liked 'House' I would like this show but that is ridiculous. House would have never succeeded if the main character was treated like the man in this show but I would love to see the character of Dr. House respond to the supporting cast of A Gifted Man. Now that would be an entertaining show.

I'm glad there were not enough people to accept, ignore, or be entertained by the twisted message of this show and that it was canceled while shows like Bones, Lie to Me,  and House with brilliant and unapologetic characters have done so well.",1361664000,4,1686,4.446601941747573

I can't believe there is only one season .We have to admit that it is simple, but in the same way drawn you to all their very special characters. I enjoyed seen how Dr. Holt transform itself into this kind and special man under the vigilance of Anna; so much different than the arrogant person he was at the begging of the season. What it truly drawn you to it is that it seems like Anna has a planned for Michael that we are all impatiently awaiting for in every episode.
