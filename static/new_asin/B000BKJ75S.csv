2421593,4,B000BKJ75S,Bought this product as a gift to a life long Buckeye fan.  The recipient found the DVD to contain enough nostalgic and historical information to make the video entertaing and informative even for a fan that already knew a lot about Ohio State football.  The DVD special features were adequate consisting of topics and interviews already covered in the documentary.  I would have prefered that the special features would have contained new information or interviews not previously covered.,1299974400,,488,5.230769230769231

2421597,5,B000BKJ75S,"Throughout the years there has been chronicles in various forms of historic games in Ohio State Football.

A huge fan may have - for example - the complete radio broadcast of the ""Super Sophomore's"" Rose Bowl victory over USC and countless tapes highlighting great games and seasons. But what if that person wants in one volume an outstanding chronicle of those great years?

And how about the new fan who wants a course in Buckeye Football that covers the top coaches, players and games without spending a lot of money?

This is where The History of Buckeye Football on DVD bulls its way to paydirt. In one volume, a fan can relive games from the 1942 championship season under coach Paul Brown to the controversial & glory years of Woody Hayes and onto the dynasty in progress under the tutelage of coach Jim Tressel.

There are interviews with legends like two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin & Chris Spielman and enough memories for the DVD to be viewed countless times.",1160524800,18,984,4.770588235294118

8087901,2,B000BKJ75S,"The history is not very detailed (one hour for 100+ years of Buckeye history is grossly inadequate), is clumsily grouped in themes (I would have prefered a chronological account of the team), and is skimpy on historical footage.  The supposed ""greatest games"" segment isn't very long and spends just a few minutes on each game.  I expected something closer to complete games, like on the Big 10's Greatest Games (or at least like the ""drive-throughs"" you see on youtube).  Perhaps I was spoiled by the in-depth and well-produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-History-of-the-Cleveland-Browns/dp/B001BGS16C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL History of the Cleveland Browns</a>&nbsp;I bought last year.  I'm as big an OSU fan as there is, but I doubt I'll watch this again.  By the way, I found ""Buckeye Classics"" (hosted by Archie Griffin and available as individual DVDs) much more satisfying and entertaining.",1389139200,,955,5.992647058823529
