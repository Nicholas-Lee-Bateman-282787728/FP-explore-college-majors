3688260,3,B001LNOLI2,I'm Giving this three stars more than it's worth I believe.  The movie starts off okay then just completely drowns.  I could care less about any of the characters honestly and they seemed cardboard to me.  I've seen many of these types of movies and this didn't seem to pull off anything spectacular in my opinion.  The way that the movie was shot seemed to always be in a very sunny type atmosphere which kills a lot of the dark suspense.  Not to mention that literally all of the characters were very sunny and positive making the fear factor nonexistent.  I thought that this was supposed to be a morbid horror suspense movie like The Ring with real characters.  The movie simply isn't Dark enough not to mention super predictable and annoying at times.  It should be renamed House of Sunlight.  I also hate how the directors are using video recording in literally everything now.  It seems like they try to go the Paranormal Activity route in a way that just comes off as disingenuous.,1462579200,5,989,4.6

3688264,4,B001LNOLI2,"On a dark stormy night you could do a lot worse than snuggle up with ""House of Darkness"".I liked the premise behind the story and the way this psychological spooker plays to a satisfying conclusion. Overall if you like bygone creepy creakers with atmosphere you'll enjoy this.",1360540800,5,276,4.8936170212765955
3688265,1,B001LNOLI2,"I knew this would be a C- movie, but wanted to see it because of Laurence Harvey and thought it might just make some sense, which it didn't.  I don't even know why they bothered shooting this, except maybe they needed the extra money.  I couldn't believe it was possible to over act as much as Elizabeth Taylor did.  It was really beneath her reputation.  I was never a fan of hers and thought the only piece where she was quite good was 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'. This movie isn't worth writing about and save your time and money.",1235779200,8,529,4.207920792079208

Which makes reading reviews on this page a bit confusing if you weren't aware of the mistake. This is obviously a review of the 2016 movie.

Most Lifetime movies have at least one recognisable face from a once popular TV show.  This one doesn't. the actors in this have been in TV shows but they're pretty obscure ones, most audiences would never have watched. Kelly (Sara Fletcher - Secret Girlfriend, Mom Tested) and Brian (Gunner Wright - Life on Top) have moved to a house near a small town that has a shed the husband can work in.  Their marriage isn't going well, Kelly wants another baby and thinks living out here away from the city will mean her husband will have more time between the sheets with her. Back in the city they had been seeing a therapist, so now make video diaries where they basically complain about the other one. Their daughter (Mykayla Sohn - Guys With Kids) is withdrawn and doesn't communicate much, except to complain some birds in a cage keep chirping and keeping her awake.  Brian seems to be a complete jerk, why on Earth you'd want to prolong being with this guy by making a second kid is hard to believe.  This guy hates the fact she massages men (she's hoping to get lots more clients out there), and treats her like she's an idiot, threatening her when she doesn't want to stay in a house with ghosts and stuff.

This is basically a low budget, not well written script wise, version of The Conjuring 2 and The Shinning.  The most memorable scene involves a con artist and some bees, but she's not even a main character.  But even that scene you don't see any cool swelling up or painful skin reactions of anything like that.  The husband character is completely unlikable in this. The movie is slow and pretty boring.  Supposedly based on true events, but in reality is based on scenes from other better haunted house movies.",1522972800,,2372,5.251322751322752
