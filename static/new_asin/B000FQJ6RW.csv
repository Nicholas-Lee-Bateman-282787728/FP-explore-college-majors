8125662,3,B000FQJ6RW,"This was just like sitting watching a gymnastics class... no real pointers or anything that we could use to practice at home.  My gymnasts ENJOYED watching it and seemed inspired by watching it, but beyond that, it wasn't what I was expecting. It could be useful for a parent to learn the names of things, because everything was identified as it was being performed, but beyond that, very limited usefulness, something we will only watch once.",1374796800,2,443,4.828947368421052
8125663,5,B000FQJ6RW,This DVD was fantastic for my Gymnastics and Dance interested Granddaughter. She really enjoyed the video and found some new ideas of exercises to improve her technique.,1364688000,2,169,5.296296296296297
8125664,5,B000FQJ6RW,"I have bought complete set of Gold Gymnastic Drills (first bought Beam and  Floor, then decided to buy Bars and Vault too). All videos are great and helpful for coaching beginner gymnasts. There are many nice tips and pointers for drills and conditioning, every drill is explained progressively, step-by-step, moving from simpler forms to complete complex forms  (you just have to watch and listen good, and definitely re-play every video in slow motion and/or several times).

These DVDs show limited set of drills, but Amanda Borden explains them quite well - better than many others.

8125665,4,B000FQJ6RW,"Although my daughter isn't quite as advanced in gymnastics as the girls in this dvd, it has already taught her quite a few things.  From just one viewing she picked up a number of pointers and has since then been practising the exercises to the point where she is now slightly ahead of her  class.  Well worth the expense of importing it all the way to South Africa :)",1179100800,10,368,4.304347826086956
