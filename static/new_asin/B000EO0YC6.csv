8111779,2,B000EO0YC6,"This DVD left out SO MANY great performances from this concert, in fact there was quite a bit left out on this dvd.  Very disappointed.  This had to be one of her best and for it to be lacking was sad.  Wish I looked for a different version.",1389484800,5,241,3.9791666666666665
8111780,5,B000EO0YC6,"Whitney Whitney Whitney ... the definitive performance ... and for the returning troops coming from Desert Storm. This lady does a bang up job. Most of her hits, and she starts it off with the Star Spangled Banner and ends with Battle Hymn Of The Republic. Worth every penny.",1338249600,2,275,4.63265306122449
8111781,1,B000EO0YC6,"Your company is just wrong. I placed this order when the item was only $10.00  You pulled it back from my order now you have jacked up the price to cash in on the demand of fans wanting to collect Whitney items.
You should have honored my order. That was just wrong!",1330387200,4,266,4.115384615384615
8111782,5,B000EO0YC6,"Buy the Video, I messed mine up playing it so much. I like the old Whitney, in this video she showed off her real skills. She sang(yes I said sang) a song called, A SONG FOR YOU, she will bring tears to your eyes. All the things that you are looking for are on the VHS tape.",1199232000,8,274,3.824561403508772
8111783,4,B000EO0YC6,"I recently bought the DVD version of the Welcome Home Heroes. I was not happy with my purchase. It has the concert, but left some of the highlighs of the concert, like the National Anthem in the begining as well as highlights of Whitney visiting the troops on the ship and the troops that were injured,it also showed her serving the troops dinner. It was wonderful to see. I am curious whether this VHS version has all the extras that were missing from the DVD. I originally recorded the concert when it aired on HBO. If anyone have purchased this VHS please let me know if it has some of the things that I have described. I would like to know before I attempt to purchase another one.",1179273600,10,685,4.359375
