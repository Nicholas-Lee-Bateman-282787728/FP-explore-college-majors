2311415,1,B0009PVZT6,"I've seen many movies in my lifetime and I can honestly say, without question, that this is the worst movie ever produced.  The CGI and the entire plot is a joke.  The only reason to watch this movie is for a strip-tease scene which was only a few minutes.  Please, do yourself a favor and do not waste a minute watching this movie.  Do not be fooled by the DVD cover!  I honestly believe that they spent more time making an interesting looking cover than the movie.  I am sufficiently upset I wasted money renting this :(",1145059200,,522,4.329896907216495
2311416,3,B0009PVZT6,"The trailer promises a movie about an oil rig that lost contact months ago.  The reality is a little different.  The movie begins near the ending and then does a flashback of less than a day.  A research station has drilled a section of the crust and discovered a form of life that is highly radioactive.  With the sample sitting on a table while the storm ship it is on is being tossed about like a toy due to a massive hurricane, it suddenly dawns on the characters that it should be stored in safe keeping.  Watching two deck hands trying to carry it as precariously as possible is almost humorous.

Long story short, the organism gets out and the race is on.  Much of the story is told from the vantage of a general trying to find out what happened and is using a computer hacker.  There are other levels of government involvement and the movie seems to make a statement that government involvement is a bad thing.  Some dream-like sequences allow the writers to throw in whatever they want (including a strip routine) but does little for the plot.

In the end we have a very convoluted story with lots of unanswered questions.  The explanation for the organism was clever and some of its actions were quite inspired.  But all in all it seems like the writers weren't sure how to tell the story so they used bits of each choice.  Not a bad popcorn film but nothing very memorable either.  I don't feel it was quite successful at what it was tying although it did seem to try.  The special effects were laughable.  The CGI looked like bad cartoons (sort of like the cartoon farmer in Reptilicus) and detracted from the film.  A good example of how CGI is merely a tool and that it takes skill to do well.",1139875200,,1707,4.402555910543131
2311417,1,B0009PVZT6,"This movie is really bad - so bad it descends into the ""have fun while laughing at it"" type - which is what we did.

The storyline has some promise. Secret government drilling, ""something"" picked up from deep underground, a gigantic storm that isolates everyone....but it is so full of holes you could drive a truck through it: the ""thing"" is supposedly so radioactive it will kill people in 10 seconds yet in all the encounters nobody ever has any radiation problems. The thing is from 24 miles down yet is unpressurized, etc. and nothing is done with the story other than to use it as an excuse for a series of random visions, including an extended scene of a stripper. There was no mention of why it bothered if it had all the powers demonstrated later in the movie.. but hey, with a movie like this why ask for a plot that makes sense.

I thought the actors did a servicable job, but then I am very forgiving and others may say it was horrible..it was pretty obvious that their ability to portray being eaten by the tentacles that would be poorly matted in later was not up to the task.

And lets talk about the special effects.. these were the absolute worst in any movie I have seen in the last 20 years. The tentacles look like Monty Python paper cutouts - literally! I've seen better special effects in lego-movies. It was unbelievable, we were simply stunned when they came on the screen. The drill rig was one scene, thats right, one picture that was re-referenced throughout the movie, plus a couple of generic hallways.

The deaths were handled off screen, except for a couple of bad ""tentacle-through-the-mouth"" effects and there really wasn't any blood and gore so I guess this would be classified more as a suspense than a horror except we were not in suspense, we were laughing at the special effects, dialog and plot holes.

I could go on, from the ""General"" in his business suit in a an empty room sitting at a card table with a laptop, to the tugboat captain that uses a shotgun to sever his towcable, to the obligatory unexplainable horror ending, this is one of those movies that is so bad its worth watching if your in the right mood. If you have run out of MST3K movies to laugh at and want to get a group of people around and have fun thats what this movie is good for.",1133740800,5,2293,4.437054631828978
2311418,1,B0009PVZT6,"I am with everyone else. This movie is awful. There were a lot of scenes in that were very unnecessary. Like the porno star strip dance. There was a Wild West scene. It just seemed like the movie was cut and paste and it didn't flow at all.  It amazes me that the studios waste money on even distributing this kind of crap.

When I was watching this movie, there was a scene that I was 100% positive I'd seen before. You know, when they were explaining how the underwater creature escaped.  There was a brief scene where they showed a woman with black eyes. I had a hard time trying to remember the title of the movie in which I saw this scene before. This is a sequel to a movie called ""Parasite."" But, one thing I noticed is they made SURE that they did not market this movie together or let us know that ""The Thing Below"" was a sequel. Gee, I wonder why. I feel they did this deliberately because if we search for the bad reviews online for ""Parasite"" then we wouldn't want to see ""The Thing Below."" Believe me you don't want to see it.",1132876800,,1039,4.185
2311419,2,B0009PVZT6,"Well, I rented this flick just to see what it is like. The acting was non-existent. CGI effect was laughable. Plot was thin and predictable. The characters were a joke. The only good thing about this was Glori Anne Gilbert who portrayed the porn star one of the crew constantly fantasized about... OK, make that two good things... LOL! :)",1131321600,,338,4.65
2311420,1,B0009PVZT6,"Amazon is offering this film along with ""The Off Season"" in a package deal. SKIP THEM BOTH!

This is really bad simply because it is not a really honest attempt to create a decent horror film. This is as bad as those awful ""Brain Damage"" films.

yuck.",1128902400,5,251,4.319148936170213
2311421,2,B0009PVZT6,Another one of those CGI generated movies that is ultimately silly and about as scary as a pile of pups.  THE THING BELOW has little coherence in its confusing plot; the effects are pretty cheesy considering what we have to work with these days and the actors are mired in a script that has no sense of suspense or terror.  Viewers are never really told what this creature really is or how it manages to infiltrate the thought processes and create hallucinatory images.  Further proof that they just don't know how to make a good horror flick these days.  Stick with John Carpenter's THE THING if you want a good scare for Halloween!,1128384000,2,633,4.575221238938053
2311422,1,B0009PVZT6,"What a just aweful movie. The acting is absolutely aweful,the CGI is terrible and the whole premisae is disgusting. I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is. The dialog between the characters is unbelievable bad. I though to myself within 5 minutes""I can't believe this movie was made"". There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It shouldn't have been made for theater or DVD!",1126656000,4,386,4.776119402985074
2311423,1,B0009PVZT6,"This is a Great movie....for a drinking game! Everytime someone laughs they have to drink up! And with this movie, there will be alot of drinking!!! Even The highest B.A.C. reached by playing this game will be higher than the feckless mahu Okole Puka's IQ who made this Lapuwale work of art! Other than that, its Awe-some......Drink up!",1126051200,3,336,4.810344827586207
2311424,1,B0009PVZT6,"Can I give less than one star?  LOL  Oh man, this may be the worst off-the-shelf (OTS) horror video ever made.  From the lame costumes (they can't even get U.S. Navy uniforms right!), to the cookie-cutter dialog and characters, to the absolutely atrocious CGI (check out the digital octopus attack scene in the first 10 minutes - it is hysterical), this one is definately going in the ""Worst Of"" Hall of Shame, if I can just find a Hall of Shame what will accept it.  It was so bad I was laughing up until the first 15 minutes were up, then I just couldn't take any more.  Trust me, I try very hard to find GOOD OTS horror flicks (see my Listmania list for ones I'd recommend), and sometimes I just have to eat the rental cost and suffer through the bad ones... oh well, perhaps this review will save you the same pain (don't let the admittedly intriguing DVD cover art fool you).

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125100800,22,1135,4.300469483568075
8065159,3,B0009PVZT6,"Fairly suspenseful movie, pretty bizarre plot, good acting for the most part.  It does not leave me with the feeling that I am glad I watched that movie.",1471824000,,153,4.464285714285714

8065162,4,B0009PVZT6,"Yes, this film is confusing and confounding at times, rarely clear where some of the scenes are taking place and why.  It begins with several scenes dealing with naval activities of a nonspecific nature, revealing nothing of importance.  Then inexplicably it tosses onto the screen...........18 hours earlier.  Earlier that what!?  What's going on???  When you have two false starts and you still have no understanding of what's happening, you belatedly realize that this is not a good sign of what's to come.  And that would be some scientific mumbo jumbo about someTHING from below, a thing that manifests itself in several different ways (the CGI version being egregious on many levels, not the least of which is a total lack of artistry, and/or a complete lack of physical probability).  This thing can compact and expand at will like Alice eating the mushroom to grow tall or small depending on the bite.  It also inspires hallucinations, which were terribly amusing.  At one point, it produced some very large naked breasts to ensnare one hapless dolt.  Basically, the plot came down to trapping a few people on a rig while the monster/alien picked them off one at a time.  Naturally, there were some secret bureaucrat types who wanted this alien/cargo taken alive.  The plot is fairly predictable, right down to the expected final shot that was rushed into place like they were in a hurry to be done with it, this doomed project destined for video hell.  It's every bit as bad as others here have described.  But.  Since I relish crappy movies...............I thought this slice of inexpensive rubbish was priceless, a hoot and a half, drivel of the lowest order, to be sure, but entertaining none the less because of its ineptitude.  As a connoisseur of crap, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it (and adding it to my collection of truly awful, very bad movies).
It's not for everyone.  Let the buyer beware..........",1427068800,,1921,4.934579439252336
8065163,1,B0009PVZT6,"a drilling platform off the Gulf of Mexico raises the worst, most incompetent CGI sea creature that you're likely ever to see from deep under the ground. It breaks free of the containment that it's being held in and goes on a rampage. Apparently it can change people's perception of reality to (I have no clue either). The government is trying to keep this particular oil rig secret, if only the Producers of Jim Wynorski's latest in a LONG series of awful movies dating back to 1990 (when he made his last enjoyable film) opted to do the same thus sparing us 94 minutes of our lives that will never be returned. Avoid this incompetent trash like Paula Poundstone and you were an orphan. The thing is if it wasn't for the CGI it wouldn't be THAT bad. Don't get me wrong it would still suck, just not as much.

Eye Candy: Glori-Anne Gilbert dances topless for no reason whatsoever",1404864000,,879,4.49375
8065164,3,B0009PVZT6,"Growing up on sci-fi B movies,this wasn't much worse than any other,but ,with that said I think only die hard Billy Warlock fans will like it because that bit of eye candy was really the only good part",1391558400,,201,4.315789473684211
8065165,3,B0009PVZT6,This is a mystery story that turns to horror. I communicated with the screenwriter and he explained his decision to keep things vague in places to enhance the mystery feeling. Not for children.,1373241600,,193,4.878787878787879
8065166,5,B0009PVZT6,"Thank you for the great condition it came. It played well and keep at the edge of my seat. This movie was sent on time and was true on the conditions it said it was. Nothing wrong about this movie.
Again, Thank you.",1322179200,,215,4.023255813953488
8065167,2,B0009PVZT6,"The Thing Below is about the a secret branch of the military transporting two radioactive rock samples, off course these samples soon turn out to be sea monsters and get loose. What follows is a crew or more or less cookie cutter monster chow...I mean characters that rummage around various locations trying to figure out what is going on and how to stop the monster, a bit of government conspiracy and allot of tentacles.

The biggest flaw about this movie is that the plot is badly written, it is jumbled and at times it is hard to understand what is really going on, there is the ship transporting the first sample and now we are at a oil rig, and then there is a second ship and what...who...where? Other than that I found the movie enjoyable, this is definitely not a masterpiece, however for one and a half hour of entertainment I think it works, the acting is okey and the locations, if confusing, are dark and spooky making them enjoyable.

The computer graphics monster in this movie is really, really bad. It is just a bunch of tentacles, which could be cool in an off itself, but the graphics are terribly done, other than that the creature is okey if rather generic. One thing I find odd about the creature however is that it uses so much energy to kill the human characters. The creature is telepathic so it catches it's prey by showing tempting images and luring people close, which is a cool enough ability, however when the creature is huge, have tentacles what can be get to about anywhere and it is quick moving, why do it need to use it's telepathy when the two legged food it intends to kill stands just a few meters away from it? Why not use a tentacle and just snatch him.

All in all this is a sub par, generic, sea monster movie, however the creature is interesting and all in all this movie is entertaining, I would recommend to pick it up cheaply as this is not worth full price, however if you can find it in a bargain bin then I think you would like it.",1309219200,2,1981,4.377717391304348
8065168,1,B0009PVZT6,"I like ""creature"" flicks - even the bad ones - so had high hopes this movie would be at least entertaining.  It wasn't.  Much of the movie makes no sense (the creature can read minds and yet apparently can't?) and the rest of it was just a jumble of weird bizarre images that didn't gel.  Do yourself a favor - watch Lake Placid and pass on this one.",1147132800,5,350,4.117647058823529
