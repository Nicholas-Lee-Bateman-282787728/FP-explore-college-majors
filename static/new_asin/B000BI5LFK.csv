2417429,1,B000BI5LFK,"A terrible film on every level.  The story is unbelievable as well as unrealistic.  The characters are not only hard to believe, but are not sympathetic so you really don't care.  There is so much slang inserted into the dialogue that's it almost incomprehensible -- they actually have a special feature on poolhall slang which I guess we're supposed to watch first.  Seeing a few well done pool shots well executed is the only positive thing I can say about this mess, but that it's not enough to warrant even a rental, as you can see that on ESPN.  You're better off watching ""The Hustler"" and ""Color of Money"" for  a 3rd, 4th or 5th time than watching this travesty even once.",1148342400,3,679,4.524590163934426
2417430,1,B000BI5LFK,See anything else.  I still can't believe someone financed this nonsense.  You're much better off going to bed an hour and a half earlier and just skipping this train wreck entirely.  Don't say I didn't warn you.,1144368000,,212,4.675675675675675
2417431,2,B000BI5LFK,"I don't know where these morons developed their grim view of pool and pool players, but it wasn't in a poolroom. First off, pool hustlers are charming (the better to relieve you of your money), unlike the venemous, scenery-chewing characters in this flick. (As an aside, today's tournament players are as likely to pull you aside and ask about the state of your salvation as to hustle you.) The only nod to realism is a string of trick shots--but try setting your drink on the rail in a real poolroom and the manager will run over with a quick dose of realism. As for the story, forget it. Lack of character development leaves little room for interest anyhow.",1141948800,,659,4.593220338983051
2417432,5,B000BI5LFK,This movie deserves alot more credit its face paced shot great and the music is amazing  I don't understand how everyone says its not original with a typical plot if you liked pool hall junkies get this one youll like it better.,1141862400,6,228,4.428571428571429
2417433,4,B000BI5LFK,"the movie plot is quite common (I mean you see many such plots) - some con artist trying to con others in a pool gallery and some intricat plot which invloves other pool players, hustlers and strong men - of coarse few cops. This is all very common but what is uncommon is the quality of photography and back ground music. Cinematography is superlative - all frames are complete - lighting is fabulous - can compare it to Sincity. Now a days in the world of computer generated movies it is difficult to find such photography.  You will notice that the editing is also great and matches with the phography - some the trick shots in the pool table are great. Good entertaining movie. You can rent it.",1137283200,3,698,4.453125
2417434,3,B000BI5LFK,"First of all, Freddie Prinze, Jr? That's odd. Until today I hadn't seen him in a movie that I'd enjoyed completely. Scratch that. I still haven't.

The deeper the plot got, the more confused I became. I'm not a simplton, either. I honestly don't know why half the people that died, died.

It's also harder to give a movie more than three stars on a review when a key line in the movie is, ""If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."" Why not just make it, ""What's up doc?"" or even ""That's what she said."" Those are sadly more amusing.

The random sex scene was also annoying. ""I just got the fool beat out of me ... again. Wanna mess around?"" It didn't flow. The only thing more enjoyable than counting the times Jericho (Prinze) got the fool beat out of him were the very very few twists in the plot.

Don't buy this movie. Rent it from Blockbuster if you have a movie pass and you've already seen what else is out there.",1135987200,8,904,4.238372093023256
2417435,4,B000BI5LFK,"Think revenge in a pool hall.  Hustlers get hustled and a deadly game plays out when a crooked cop and a pool hustler cross paths.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot.

When's the last time we saw Freddie Prinze Jr?  This movie is worth the price of seeing Ving Rhames suck on chicken feet.  By the end of the movie you're confused as to just who is going to come out on top.  It's cheap pool movie entertainment and worth a rental.",1135728000,,444,4.045977011494253

2417438,5,B000BI5LFK,You would of never thought the outcome was going to be what it was but it was a good movie and I plan on watching it over and over again!!,1366329600,,138,3.6333333333333333
2417439,2,B000BI5LFK,Not nothing that i thought it would be. Not much in pool playing would not get if you want a movie about pool playing. I plan on giving it away or throwing it away.,1355097600,,164,3.8529411764705883
2417440,4,B000BI5LFK,"This was a good movie. It was suspenseful with alot of action. However, there was to much pool for me.",1352937600,,102,4.15
2417441,5,B000BI5LFK,"I rec'd the movie fast which i liked and there was no strach marks on the CD which i liked as well.  I would recommend anyone who is looking for movies to ship from this shipper.

Thank you",1284940800,,189,3.9473684210526314
2417442,2,B000BI5LFK,"I thought the movie had poor acting and a terrible plot.  What should I have expected with Freddie Prinze Jr. though.  I wouldn't recomend this video if you are a pool junkie like I am.  I'm still waiting for the next great movie to take over where the ""Color of Money"" left off.  I think it's about time for one.",1169164800,,313,4.166666666666667
2417443,1,B000BI5LFK,"To make a long movie short, this movie sucks. Don't waste your time. Most pool movies suck. If you want to see a good pool movie watch stickmen. Its a independent film from New Zealand but it is really good.",1160784000,,207,4.2
2417444,4,B000BI5LFK,"A lot of people give this movie crap and say it gives ""pool a bad name"".  Movies such as the ""Hustler"", ""Color of Money"", and ""Poolhall Junkies"" though good in their own respects have long since given pool and pool players a bad rep as macho, greedy, pigheads who play a great game but are stupid when it comes to other aspects of life.  SG has made it no better or worse than the other films have.

Saying that, this is a revenge story set in a poolhall.  I'm sure poker players everywhere would be spewing the same mindless battle cry ""It gives us a bad name"" if this movie took place over a poker table.  People fail to see that and are too concerned whether or not this film gives who a bad name.

Cinematography is excellent.  Acting is decent.  Some nice pool action.  Not the greatest pool film ever but certainly not as bad as people would like you to believe.",1160092800,3,868,4.276073619631902
2417445,3,B000BI5LFK,"This movie had potential although in some ways it is a rip off of ""The Hustler"" with Paul Newman and thats one of the reasons this movie suffered because Freddie Prince JR sure is not Paul Newman If you have seen The Hustler than maybe you can give this movie a shot  ,, I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about with the slang it is understandable I didn't really notice any slang in the movie .. The bright spots of the movie are Ving Rhames, your always going to get a good performance from , he played his part well and Roselyn Sanchez, I have not seen her in any movie previous to this one , Not only is she beatiful but she can actually act this is usually uncommon with beatiful actresses. Really those where the only two reasons I bought this movie cause I am a Ving Rhames fan and I wanted to see Roselyn Sanchez.  Overall for about 3 bucks I would say it is possibly worth owning but for the price of renting it you might as well just buy it",1159401600,,964,4.122340425531915
