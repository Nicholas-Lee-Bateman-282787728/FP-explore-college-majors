Just like the TIME LIFE: WORLD AT WAR collection. That is a box set with 5 disks

and 6 titles on each disk. THIS is their pick of what THEY think is great.

The Ultimate National Geographic DVD Collection contains:

7 disks:

1) 30 Years Of National Geographic

2) Nature's Fury

3) Secrets Of The Titanic

4) Surviving Everest

5) The Battle For Midway

6) The Photographers

7) Tigers Of The Snow

So you pay $150  for 7 disks (that's $21/ per disk) and you don't get to choose which ones.

You are better off buying them separately, and picking the ones you like.

Ultimate it is NOT.",1095206400,169,676,4.21259842519685
7929277,5,B000051S4X,"National Geographic is the best company for geography lovers like myself. National Geographic takes us in life-risking settings in real places all around the four corners of our world. A lot of children and adults still don't even know that there is a National Geographic. And to see that only one person reveiwed this exellent set of spellbounding places frightens me. People should take National Geographic more seriously and start respecting the people who make these features. For this collection, the camera angles inside the films are exellent. The cameramen and photographers are obviously professionals. If you want your child to start liking geography or learn something while watching television at the same time this is just for you. If you child dosn't like experiencing it by watching the movies they can learn by playing fun and educational games and quizes as special features. This is a must have collection. It is quite expensive, but it is worth the money.",1052265600,22,974,5.09375
