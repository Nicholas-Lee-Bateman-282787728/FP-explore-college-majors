8278632,5,B001AQM48E,This is an incredibly thorough DVD that explains surf fishing in depth. It applies to any species of fish you pursue in the surf and there is almost no filler in the whole DVD. I learned a lot from watching it.,1395187200,,210,4.146341463414634
8278633,5,B001AQM48E,This has improved some of my freshwater tactics as well as given me an insight to my new adventure into saltwater. Everything a beginner needs to know plus some knowledge for the average fisherman.

8278635,5,B001AQM48E,"A wonderful, comprehensive introduction to surf fishing. While there are many dozens of books available on the subject, actually seeing what something looks like is of great benefit. The section on 'reading the beach' is about as succinct and helpful a tutorial as I've ever come across. The film covers the basics of surf fishing very well. It also introduces the more advanced considerations, while always reminding the viewer that surf fishing may always be inspiring, educational, and fun...with a little knowledge, patience, and respect.",1318550400,3,542,5.3882352941176475
