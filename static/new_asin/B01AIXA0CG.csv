8747512,3,B01AIXA0CG,"Scholastic / Weston Woods puts out a line of DVDs containing animated (more or less) versions of top children's picture books.  As a children's librarian, I buy all of these for the children's room of my library.  Some of them are really wonderful and beloved by the children.  This one is not one of their best, but it is okay and has its uses. The theme here is strong women who pioneered for women's place in the world.  I can see that this could be useful for teaching women's history, maybe during Women's History Month.  This might be good for home schoolers.  However, I cannot think that too many children are going to be clamoring to watch this DVD over and over again.  The main problem is that there just isn't much animation on this project.  It seems they went low-budget.  Animation is mostly just an arm or leg moving occasionally on an otherwise static illustration.
The books on this DVD are.....
Me...Jane - Jane Goodall, as a child, likes nature.  You don't know it's Jane Goodall until the very end.

Who says women can't the doctors? - The story of Elizabeth Blackwell.  No animation, just a camera panning a still illustration.

I Could Do That:!: Esther Morris  Gets Women the Vote - Minimal animation, mostly still pictures with just an occasional arm movement.  This is about a girl who watches her father vote, and grows up to be a suffragette.

Players in Pigtails - Women baseball players.  Another one with only occasional bits of animation.  This is about the women's baseball leagues that played during WWII while the male players were off fighting the war.  This is the most fun book on the project.

The bonus material is an interview with Jane Goodal and Patrick McDonnell, which is about the Me..Jane book he wrote about her.  This conversation is more on an adult level.  She is quite elegant and sweet.  He seems a bit uncomfortable, but nice.",1474848000,,1880,4.664634146341464
