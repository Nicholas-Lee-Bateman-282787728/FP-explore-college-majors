I could watch this  movie anytime and never get tired of it .  Michael Peterson __ The Black Wizard__Too FFffing  Cool__Amazon is great and this came so fast from the distributer that was in Europe___I couldn't believe it___Thank's to all involved and Good Surfing "" MP""  where ever you are![Michael , sadly, made his exit on March 12, 2012 suffering a heart attack but his place in the surfing world  will probably not be forgotten]",1385683200,,668,4.418032786885246
8384526,5,B002Z8L3GA,"An amazing movie, especially now that MP has passed.  If you have read MP, then this IS the sequel.  Chronicles MP in his later days.  If only his mates could have got him away from his mum and got him back in the water, MP could have been saved.  Poor guy, one of the greatest surfers the planet has ever seen, and we will never know just what they did to him all those many months in hospital.  Rest easy, MP.",1345593600,2,411,4.0246913580246915

Peterson, a true legend in Oz but barely known over here even to many surf fans, ruled the Australian waves from '72 to '77, winning every contest out there while living the Jeff Spiccoli myth before it was even created. This excellent documentary traces his rise and fall, and is a big cut above most surfing docs.

Worth watching as a behavioral study as much as a surf film, SFMP shows the ravages of paranoid schizophrenia side by side with footage of amazing rides by MP (and others). It's short, barely an hour, and you wish it could go on longer, despite its sadness.

But this dvd trumps that thought, as it's full of great extras, from the music of world-class Aussie singer/surfer Beau Young and the rather cool band Brown Birds, to some nice interviews, including the ever-hilarious Rabbit Bartholemew, and plenty more. The 30-minute old school flick Dogs Run Free is a real find, and a top-notch addition to an already exemplary dvd.

A must-watch for any surfer, and all who've ever had to deal with mental illness, as sufferer or friend, SFMP is a surf film with unexpected depth and one of the best of the genre, easily as good as Dogtown.

Good on ya to director Jolyon Hoff for telling this tale with real sensitivity and humanity.",1260921600,6,1259,4.62780269058296
