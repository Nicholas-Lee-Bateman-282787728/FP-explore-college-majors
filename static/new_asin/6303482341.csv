683542,5,6303482341,"I saw Mexico City in a sneak screening.  I was particularly overwhelmed by the acting.  Stacy Edwards gives a multi-layered performance as MITCH who endures many Greek-styled tragedies; the death of her children, spousal infidelity, a
subsequent divorce, and her brother's mysterious disappearance.  At the hand of a lesser director -- and actress -- these instances would have surpassed any
audience's suspension of disbelief, but Shepard and Edwards triumph, delivering a truly great tragedy of their own.",1013212800,3,507,5.558441558441558
683543,4,6303482341,"Richard Shepard's fascination with the kidnapping thriller has yielded another successful twisted tale in MEXICO CITY (the other two: MERCY and OXYGEN).  Combining deft genre filmmaking chops with real insight into what it means to feel truly vulnerable, in MEXICO CITY, Shepard leads the viewer down a uniquely ravaged road of intrigue, deception, heartbreak and loss.
Cinematographer Sarah Cawley is equally at the top of her game, painting many moody tableaus.  Editor Adam Lichtenstein ably sets Cawley's rich compositions against each other, adding heft to the story's impact.  Rolfe Kent's score completes the circle by perfectly echoing Shepard's search for faith in a seemingly godless world.
Let me qualify by saying that MEXICO CITY is by no means perfect, but if a thought-provoking thriller is what you're after, then see this film.",1012089600,3,844,5.378787878787879

However - I am now compelled to break my silence because the film ""Mexico City"" is too true to ignore.  MY ADVICE - Enter Mexico at your own peril - if you do enter and suffer lawless behaviour the only help you would receive is from the ""American Embassy.""  I lived in Mexico for five years and I advise you - in time of trouble - forget about Mexican Government assistance - THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO ON ALL LEVELS IS MORE CORRUPT THAN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CRIMINALS THAT ASSAULT YOU.  IN SHORT - Lawful Justice does not exist in a ""CORRUPT LAWLESS STATE.""  See this movie as the story is as close to the truth as I have ever seen on a DVD.",1429920000,,799,4.286666666666667

Not being well versed in the language and noting it was available in an English version decide to buy. The same day!  Haven't seen it through - the ending in Spanish-  has left me puzzled.

7850501,3,6303482341,"The super Cities series on Vhs are ok for the price paid but they move very quickly and tend to be very out of date and some of the information was no longer relevant. Good for basic information and I didn't pay much for this used copy so it was ok.
Wouldn't be my first choice in travel videos but if you can find one on the cheap, don't pass it up as they are still entertaining.",1292976000,,381,3.961038961038961
7850502,5,6303482341,"All I can say is that I watched this film and was surprised to find that it was filmed in the very same beautiful hotel that I spent my honeymoon. This story was both engaging and interesting and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking or even fantasising about going to mexico city.

 It is more if a ""film"" than a ""movie"" so bring your brain with you.  It captured the heart and pulse of Mexico City without having to result to over stereotyped characters (well the character pedro the taxi driver was a bit over the top) but bearable and likable.

 The story flows well and the action is tame but exciting. The main protagonist ""Mich"", is a woman with nothing to loose but still she looses her brother in the heart of MC.  Her search for him becomes very real and very dangerous. She is a stranger in a strange land who can't speak a lick of spanish searching for a needle in a haystack.

Buy this film you won't regret it. (not recommended for the fan of mindless action flicks with taylor made car explosions and standard issue storytelling)",1201651200,,1047,4.393782383419689
7850503,4,6303482341,"The movie itself was pretty good, if only for the scenery of Mexico City. The movie was mostly shot there and captures the city perfectly in all of its glory and all of its horror. But the real thing to watch for on the DVD is the director's commentary. It's not one or two scenes, but the ENTIRE movie. I watched it twice for that reason. The director gives fantastic insight into making movies and particularly interesting were his stories about filming in one of the most dangerous cities in the world, including crew being kidnapped. A must watch.",1119744000,,551,4.575757575757576

7850505,5,6303482341,"Mexico City is a good movie for those looking for a mystery film, without the typical Hollywood feel.  the acting was decent and the story keeps moving.  What I liked most is that the movie will suprise you with new clues that link up the mystery.  Some suspensful scenes too.  I thought the fild was beautifully shot and choreographed too.",1020211200,6,340,4.616666666666666
7850506,2,6303482341,"""Mexico City,"" a relatively unknown film about a woman's struggle to find her missing brother in a strange country, accomplishes two things in its short yet exceedingly lengthy running time: A) it diminishes one's intentions of ever planning a trip south of the border, and B) it provides its viewer an excuse never to watch another direct-to-video ...such as this again.
The film is an exercise in tedium, beginning with promise that becomes squandered by the usual characteristics that plague such films. The acting never manages to evoke any emotion, the direction at the hand of director/writer Richard Shepard never gives the film the uplift it needs to successfully take flight, and the overall experience of watching the film's potential being stomped into the earth is grounds for sheer disappointment.
In some ways, Shepard's story mirrors certain aspects of another film, the theatrically released ""Not Without My Daughter,"" in which Sally Field played a real-life house wife who, while on a vacation in the Middle East with her Iranian husband, is given an extended stay she doesn't want. Here, we are introduced to brother and sister duo Mitch (Stacy Edwards) and Sam (Johnny Zander), who are stopping over in Mexico City on their way to another destination. They make nice with taxi driver Pedro (Jorge Robles), who becomes Mitch's search party partner when Sam doesn't return to their hotel the following morning.
The setup carries more weight than it deserves, and in the beginning moments, things look like they just might work. Mitch finds herself all alone and estranged by those around her. She cannot speak Spanish, though the film sidesteps major confrontations in which languages go misunderstood. She attempts to go to the police, before which a member of hotel personnel tells her, ""He will turn up soon, I promise.""
Once Mitch decides to go out on her own and find Sam, things start going downhill. The story ties in a subplot introduced in an early scene in the movie, that which has to do with the corrupt plan among various high-ranking police officers to humiliate the president... somehow, though not without much intelligence, it manages to find itself into Mitch's dilemna, supplying the film with an unneeded subplot that is substandard and misguided. It's almost as if the movie is taking the easy way out, right down to its haphazard ending, which is abrupt and unfocused.
Just as Shepard doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on the material, neither does his cast. Edwards is unable to instill much emotional force into Mitch; many of the scenes requiring a wide range of dynamics falter miserably when filtered through her monotone voice and cold appearance. Robles isn't given much to work with, while everyone else pretty much founders under cliche. After watching ""Mexico City,"" I'd like to think Mitch would find it more appropriate to ask, ""Have you seen my script?""",1018656000,6,2905,5.029045643153527
