7844044,2,6303276873,"Released about two years after its prequel, ""Fast Getaway 2"" is the unnecessary follow-up to a fun action-comedy, and it doesn't do a lot of things right. The original ended with definite sequel potential, but a different director (Oley Sassone, who did the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B000KCJQ1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>) and a new writer (Mark Sevi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arachnid/dp/B00005UWAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arachnid</a>) opt for an out-of-the-blue story with weaker production values and inferior action, resulting in a film that just doesn't measure up to its cult classic predecessor. Please pardon all further comparisons I make between the two.

The story: now a security contractor, ex-bank robber Nelson Potter (Corey Haim,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prayer-of-the-Rollerboys/dp/B00008G8M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prayer of the Rollerboys</a>) is framed by his former partner Lily (Cynthia Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-O-Brien/dp/B000F3WBKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China O'Brien</a>) as part of a plan to stage a massive heist. He'll need the help of his incarcerated father (Leo Rossi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accused/dp/B00005Y1UT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accused</a>) and business partner (Sarah Buxton, ""The Bold and the Beautiful"") to outwit both Lily and a bullying FBI agent (Peter Liapis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghoulies/dp/B00009PY4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghoulies</a>).

I might have missed the exposition, but I don't think it's ever revealed how Nelson managed to get into the security business, how Sam got into prison, and what the heck became of Marcia Strassman's character from the first film. Subsequently, everything that follows feels forced: the antagonism of the FBI guy, Lily's ongoing determination to screw up Nelson's life, and especially the catty romance between Corey's and Sarah Buxton's characters all seem unnecessary because it feels like the entire story's just been dropped in your lap. It doesn't help that Nelson's become pretty unlikable since the first film: he was cocky and bratty before, but he had naivet to fall back on and his good side came out via his interactions with his father, but since the character is older now and has much less screentime with Leo Rossi (though what's there is still enjoyable), he comes across as a bit of a jerk with a higher opinion of himself than everyone around him.

Whereas the original feature was bright and sleek, the sequel has the same muddy look to it and lowered production values (e.g. handheld camerawork, last-minute slow motion) of any cheap direct-to-video feature. And while the action is worth at least half a look, it's again not as good. Cynthia Rothrock's beat-em-up scenes feature little more than basic choreography and they're not always filmed that great. There are two car chases to be seen, and the second one is pretty decent, if only for the inclusion of a grenade launcher that results in an exploding outhouse. Cumulatively, though, there's less action this second time around and none of it is really worth waiting for when it comes down to it.

If you really liked the characters from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Getaway/dp/6302150957/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Getaway</a>, I encourage you to get this film for that reason alone. But if, like me, you were hoping for some more decent action and retro vibes from the early '90s, don't bother. The charm of the original's gone from this one, and even as its own story this one just doesn't hold up beyond catching it on TV some night.",1357776000,,3955,6.499051233396584
7844045,2,6303276873,"Not exactly the best movie of all time (or even a great one...it's actually quite cheezy... for one, there's no way Tuscon, AZ has streets that raceable...), but it has it's key points (Mainly the chases, but really.... Police keeping up with an FD? Not likely...)
Anyway, if you have an unhealthy addiction to RX-7s or just wanna see a good chase scene or two, you should pick this movie up.... Otherwise it's a huge waste of time
Oh.... and Cory Haim?

7844047,2,6303276873,"""Fast Getaway"" was a light action comedy, a good mix of action and comedy. But this fallow up isen't, all that was good in the first one is gone. With better script, bigger budget and better actors it have been a good fallow up. Don't waste your time with this one, but if you like ""Double O'Kid"" maybe you will think this is a good one.",1029456000,2,337,4.121212121212121
