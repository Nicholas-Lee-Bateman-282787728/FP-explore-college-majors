8426845,2,B004EFN6LC,Beware. This is a bootleg quality version of the Art or Bust show that was available on VHS. The sound is fine but the picture is terrible. Somewhat distorted and extremely grainy. I give an extra star because the show itself is great. You may just want to get the cd version. This item should not be sold through quality merchants.,1295395200,10,332,4.459016393442623
