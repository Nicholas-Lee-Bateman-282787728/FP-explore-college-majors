8671402,4,B00MBI0A9A,"Retromedia has released another two German cult movies featuring the works of famous British mystery writer Edgar Wallace.
The German fascination with Wallace mysteries began in 1959 and continued through to the seventies.  The versions here and what were released internationally at the time have been dubbed into English with varying results.
Harald Reinl's ""The Terrible People"" (Die Bande des Schreckens, 1960) also known as ""Hand of the Gallows"" tells of a master criminal who has been hanged but seemingly reappears to execute a number of revenge killings.  One of the intended victims is a Scotland Yard Inspector, played by the very capable Joachim Fuchsberger, a staple in these types of films over the next decade or so.  A good supporting cast led by the very attractive Karin Dor (married to director Reinl between 1954 and 1968, and who would later appear in international hits such as the Bond film ""You Only Live Twice"" and Hitchcock's ""Topaz""), Eddie Arent in another of his bumbling comedy roles as a faint hearted police photographer, the striking Elisabeth Flickenschildt adding more than a touch of mystery to the proceedings.
Lots of killings and bizarre goings on, some not all that believable but a generally entertaining and curious film if a bit on the slow side.
Director Reinl, who began his film career as Leni Riefenstahl's double and was assistant director on her ""Tiefland"", previously helmed the much superior ""Fellowship of the Frog"" (Edgar Wallace Collection Volume 1).  A prolific director in the sixties adapting Wallace crime novels, Karl May adventures and Dr. Mabuse films, his films also included ""Die Nibelungen"" (66) and the hit documentary ""Chariots of the Gods?"".
Alfred Vohrer's ""Inn on the River"" (Das Gasthaus an der Themse, 1962) has The Shark creating havoc, murdering his victims with his deadly spear gun and escaping into the Thames in scuba gear.  Joachim Fuchsberger is back (albeit with a new voice and  name shortened to Berger on the credits!) as Inspector in charge of the Greenwich Water Police and on assignment to capture the watery villain.  Eddie Arendt is also back, providing comedy capers as the hapless Barnaby and so is the intriguing Elisabeth Flickenschildt (surname abbreviated to Flick), a distinguished stage actress who excelled at playing villainous roles and there is also any early appearance by Klaus Kinski playing  the type of character he became noted for.
""Inn"" works reasonably well and is by far the better of the two offerings  on this bill.
Director Vohrer, one of the most influential figures in German film and television from the 60's to 80's, specialized in better than average thrillers and genre films, and would later direct many episodes of the superb German detective series, ""Derrick"".
All in all don't expect too much from these films.  They are best accepted as mildly entertaining thrillers and interesting curiosities made just prior to the new wave of German cinema.",1451433600,,2967,5.124223602484472

8671404,4,B00MBI0A9A,"The archivists at Retromedia Entertainment continue to locate and release the Edgar Wallace adaptations of Directors Harold Reinl and Alfred Vohrer which were so prolific in West Germany in the early sixties.  These films were partly influential for the Italian Giallo genre to springboard into action with the early works of Director Mario Bava and would come to fruition by Director Dario Argento.  Here we have two Krimi rarities starting off with Director Reinl's 'THE TERRIBLE PEOPLE' aka 'HANDS OF THE GALLOWS' aka  'DIE BANDE DES SCHRECKENS' -1960, an entertaining  mystery resembling the old PRC /MONOGRAM  horrors of the 1940's.  The film stars four of the Krimi genres prominent actors:the inspector played by Joachim  Fuchsberger, the beautiful Karin Dor, sinister Dieter Eppler,  and the comic relief of Eddi Arent.  The photography by Alfred Benitz is superb as we are witness to a curse issued by a megalomaniac on his way to the gallows to the people responsible for his capture.  The bodies pile up as his ghost seems to come and go along with his henchman until the tense climax with a surprise ending to round out the running time.  The film is presented in a black and white window boxed  widescreen print culled from a worn 16mm print with splices annoyingly showing up to spoil some tense dialogue and action exchanges intermittently.  The film, however , is so rarely seen that it seems redundant to quibble but I am just warning the viewers.  The next film , Director Vohrer's 'INN ON THE RIVER' aka 'DAS GASTHAUS A DER THEMSE' -1962 fairs much better quality wise.  Here we have a villain known as the Shark who is murdering people dressed in scuba gear and using a spear gun prowling the sewer tunnels along the Thames.  The film seems to be the precursor to Director Dick Maas 's underrated rarely seen thriller 'AMSTERDAMNED'- 1988 (yet to see a digital release) as the killer is one step ahead of our inspector again played by Fuchsberger.  Eddi Arent helps once again and a very young Klaus Kinski cameos as a sleazy thug while the plot unfolds a diamond smuggling ring led by a surprise character within the cast.  What helps the film is the atmospheric photography by Karl Loeb utilizing fog and smoke expertly. The film is also presented window boxed widescreen from a pristine 16mm print and looks just perfect.  Both films are dubbed in English and does not distract the viewer from the stories as so many of them did at that time due to poorly dubbed voices .  Highly recommended to Krimi fans and mystery lovers,  the price is just right for this wonderful collection from the golden age of Euro thrillers.  Keep em coming, Retromedia.",1425945600,,2671,4.81140350877193

8671407,5,B00MBI0A9A,Two very good old school B/W mystery movies. Both have great plots and all the action you could want in such movies. The pictures are good the sound very good. I love these older mystery movies they are so much better than what they make today. They keep your attention and give you the opportunity to be part of what is going on and this gives you time to see if you can figure out the end ahead of time. The acting is also good. That always helps. Part of the second movie is done in an old motel which adds to the mystery factor.,1415836800,4,532,4.076190476190476
8671408,4,B00MBI0A9A,"Edgar Wallace Collection Volume 3 (2014) contains The Terrible People (1960), and The Inn By The River (1962), two Krimi's based on the works of author Edgar Wallace (1875-1932).  Typically produced in Germany with German actors, Krimi's were crime thrillers usually set in Britain, and dubbed in English.  While not the first time these films have been released on DVD, these versions both presented in 1.66:1 widescreen, look quite good for being over fifty years old.

The Terrible People (3.5 stars)
This is a pretty interesting mystery that keeps you guessing, as a murderer named Shelton swears that he will take revenge on those responsible for his execution.  Police investigator Long (Joachim Fuchsberger), responsible for Shelton's capture, heads the investigation when those on the hanged man's hit list begin to turn up dead.  The suspense continues to build nicely, even after some of conspirators are revealed.  Karin Dor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Only-Live-Twice/dp/B00AZFECJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Only Live Twice</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strangler-of-Blackmoor-Castle/dp/B0000A0DVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strangler of Blackmoor Castle</a>)  plays a young innocent caught up in the macabre drama.

The Inn By the River (3.5 stars)
This tale has a more obscure plot, as along the river a mysterious figure known as ""the Shark"" is killing people with a spear gun.  Inspector Wade (Joachim Fuchsberger) from Scotland Yard is conducting the investigation, which appears to have few leads, as the killer is utilizing the sewer system to make his escape.  As usual there's a young lady in the middle of the mystery, with Brigitte Grothum serving as Wade's youthful love interest. Klaus Kinski also has a minor role.

A forerunner of the giallo, Krimi's often featured some of the same performers, like Karin Dor, Elizabeth Flickenschildt, and Joachim Fuchsberger, who stars in each of these films.  The black and white presentation tends to give the films an older look, and darker atmosphere.  These films feature plenty of violence, and the identity of killer or killers, usually comes as a surprise.  If you're a mystery buff or giallo fan, you might appreciate these films, well as the previous volumes in the Edgar Wallace collection.",1414713600,5,2368,5.80635838150289
8671409,5,B00MBI0A9A,"The third in Retromedia's Edgar Wallace Krimi series, both THE TERRIBLE PEOPLE and INN ON THE RIVER (a double feature of mayhem!) get nice widescreen releases. If you haven't experienced the Edgar Wallace German crime films from the 1960s then you're really in for a treat. Part James Bond, part The Avengers all wrapped around a series of diabolic master criminals and psycho killers creating havoc for the British constabulary. And all in glorious widescreen black and white, with jazzy soundtracks to boot!
These films are some of my most beloved, in a trashy over the top kind of way. THE TERRIBLE PEOPLE is no exception as a dead man returns from the gallows to carry out his death threats and INN ON THE RIVER features a mad killer in scuba gear known as The Shark. Suspense and plot twists galore!...Hopefully Retromedia will continue releasing these bizarre classics as there are still many deserving of such a worthy presentation. I will happily purchase any and all of future releases....I just love this stuff.",1414454400,5,1021,4.907514450867052
