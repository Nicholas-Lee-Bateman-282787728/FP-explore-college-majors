2412347,4,B000BBOU68,"I do this workout when I'm not in the mood to work out. Vanessa Isaacs is so easygoing and cool that she charms you into dancing along with her. The routine takes about 40 easy minutes. Unlike every other workout dvd I own, where there is a flat white wall behind the dancers, the producers of this video placed the dancers in a mexican barrio street corner soundstage. Not exactly Brazilian, but close enough, and compared to others, absolutely lavish! A band of Brazilian percussionists provide the ""live"" music and seem to be having a jolly good time watching the girls do their thing.

The routine is fairly simple, a fact that I love, because once you've mastered the steps, you can do it effortlessly and -in Vanessa's words- ""groove"". When you are done, you feel invigorated, ready for the next thing in your to-do list and glad you already worked out. It feels a little bit like cheating, so it should not be your main workout dvd, but if you work out around 5 times a week, this routine will come in handy for those days when you are either in a hurry or drained.",1168128000,3,1072,4.469387755102041
2412348,5,B000BBOU68,"This video was so much fun.  Whether you ""master"" the moves are not is irrelvant.  You are moving and dancing and sweating the whole time!  Ive never taken dance, and i got all of the movements pretty easily.  Also, there is an instructional section that breaks down all the moves for you.  I recommend you do this part one or two times before doing the video if youve never done any dancing before.

The music is fun and the instructor is enjoyable.  My roomate did the video with me and he loved it as well.  He liked it so much, he suggested we do it every morning to wake up before classes.

I haven't worked out much before this, i just do a little pilates, so i was not surprised that i was sweating, but my roomate runs 3-5 miles daily and he was sweating too!  Absolutely wonderful exercise video!  The movements are far too fast for me to reccomend this video to my mother, but for me and my roomate, an excellent find!",1163548800,3,928,4.275862068965517
2412349,4,B000BBOU68,I haven't danced since my jazz dance class in 3rd grade.  This DVD made me want to get out there again.  The music is fun and the steps are easy enough for a novice.  I was sweatin' in no time flat.,1162512000,2,198,3.7804878048780486
2412350,5,B000BBOU68,"I just did this routine for the first time last night and I am hooked!  The instructor is easy to follow, and I love that there is a separate section that outlines the moves for you.  That way, you can learn the steps before you even workout.  It is a medium intensity video, and I was definitely sweating during this one!  My legs are even a little sore, and I am no stranger to exercise!  I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to spice up their workout routine (or their love life - this video has HOT moves.)",1157760000,6,522,4.18
2412351,4,B000BBOU68,"Vanessa had a previous dvd called ""Brazilian Dance Workout"" that had great ideas, but she didn't teach enough & used many stage-style complicated steps. This time she's fixed those mistakes.
The menu options are:  Guidelines, Complete workout, Workout chapters, Learning the moves, About Samba, About Brazil & Credits
It's set on the street with 5 girls dancing backup & live band on the sidewalk.
She teaches the steps not only in it's own menu option: basic step (more open step back & forth), samba roll (hip circle), samba box (more open regular box step), samba (simplified samba easy step & raises heart rate), samba twist (twisted grapevine, really works the obliques & abs) & samba groove (easy step w/letting go of abs & chest back & forth) but also when she first introduces the dvd. She teaches in half times a few times with some basic cues which is enough to get it for almost anyone.
The pace is great, she doesn't let you take a break, only drop to basic step in between. She builds up the 6 different steps into a routine.
The only minor complaints I have is I wish there were more steps & the band is just percussion, so to me it can get boring/tedious after a while.
This is great for those who don't know how latin dance & moderately workout. Those who are in great shape & already know latin dancing might find this too easy.
There's a trailer of this & her other dvds at: collegevideo com",1155081600,57,1409,4.525490196078431
2412352,4,B000BBOU68,"This may seem silly  to some people, but this dvd smells terrible.  Mine has a horrible odor like burnt tar - really strong.  I like the dvd itself, but the smell really makes me nauseated.  No, I do not have some weird smell obsession.  I have almost 100 dvds and have never encountered this before.  Otherwise, the dvd is fun.  I have Vanessa Isaac's first dvd and will probably get the second samba dvd.  Hope it smells better.",1151193600,9,430,4.423076923076923
2412353,5,B000BBOU68,"Samba Party Workouts 1 and 2 by Vanessa Isaac are fun workouts.  As others have pointed out they are pretty basic.  Since most people don't know much about Samba I assume this is done purposely to ease people into unfamiliar movements.  If you don't have a strong dance background or want a slow, clear introduction to some basic samba movements, I would recommend these as a good starting point.  She explains things very clearly and there is a section you can use to review individual movements slowly with additional explanation. If you know some samba, have alot of dance experience, or are looking for a challenge I recommend the SamBody Workout.  I've been doing salsa/merengue/bachata off and on for about 12 years and I've been doing swing dancing for the past 7.  I find that Sambody gives me a run for my money.  It's a ton of fun but it will take me a few workouts to get the moves down.  I like all of them but SamBody definitely challenges me quite a bit.  It's super fun!!  I also like the World Dance workout by Elsa Leandros.  It has a Samba segment along with several other dances and will give you a couple extra moves to spice things up if you really want to pick up a variety of moves.

I did the Samba Party 1 dvd, using the instructional section first, and was able to do all the moves the first time without any problems.  I did Samba Party 2 right afterwards, again using the instructional segment first, and was able to complete it with ease the first time.  They were both fun and I could see myself doing these moves on a social dance floor.  Later in the week I did Elsa's dvd which was a little more challenging since it covers several dancestyles.  I did the instructional section first and found the workout to be fun and it gave me a good workout.  It had some fun samba moves that were not covered in Vanessa's dvds.  The next day I tried the SamBody workout -Basic Steps.  It was fun but I couldn't quite get all the steps on the first go, even with some rewinding.  It's faster pace with alot more movements performed overall.  I think my brain got a little overloaded.  I haven't tried my SamBody -Advanced Routines 1 yet but I did watch it and it looks fun.  I can't wait to work my way up to it!",1149465600,7,2233,4.353510895883777
2412354,4,B000BBOU68,"I really did enjoy this workout, since it was upbeat and interesting.  There was lots of repetition of the same steps, which I personally liked because that way I could not only perfect the step but I could add my own ""flair,"" also.  While I did love this product (a fun way to get moving) it was a little short and awfully basic.  I don't know that much about samba, so I'm not sure if it's only because samba is not all that elaborate of a dance or if it's just because this is purely a beginner's video.  Overall, it was fun, it is a good samba foundation, but I got sick of the same thing when I did it one week in a row...I'd suggest throwing in some other videos/exercises to spice things up.",1147132800,10,698,4.148148148148148
2412355,5,B000BBOU68,"I love this video!  It's easy to learn the steps during the video but there is a separate section with the different steps if you need it.  You can put more into the movements (raise your arms higher, sway your hips more, twist more, use more upper body motion)or you can take it easier by moving your body less.  I find that each time I do it, I'm upping the intensity just by getting more into it and moving more.  I feel like I'm really dancing not just repeating exercie movements.  The drumming was appropriate--it didn't overwhelm the dancing.  I suppose one could get more or less out of the drumming depending on your focus.  I am very happy I spent my money on this video!!",1141171200,44,682,4.365079365079365
2412356,4,B000BBOU68,I used this video to learn basic samba steps.  It was also useful to share Brazilian culture.,1140566400,3,93,4.470588235294118
2412394,5,B000BBOU68,Fun and fast. Great for your legs. Easy to follow dance steps. A great beginner workout. Nice for off days.,1368662400,,107,4.4
2412395,5,B000BBOU68,You will break a sweat doing this authentic workout routine.  I love how the instructor is actually from Brazil.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1368403200,,142,4.875
2412396,4,B000BBOU68,"For those of us who aren't looking to kill ourselves every time we workout, this is a fun addition to an exercise routine. Ms. Isaac does a great job going over the steps so learning the dance isn't frustrating (as I've found many dance workouts are). What I like most about it is that I always have fun when I do this video and it was part of a fitness regime that helped me lose 50 pounds. If you're a fitness lunatic or dance professional then, no, this video isn't for you, but if you're a regular person looking to have some fun while getting your daily exercise, I highly recommend this workout.",1367884800,2,601,4.327433628318584
2412397,5,B000BBOU68,"When I saw this DVD the cover just looked like something fun to try. But of course  you can't tell how good it is by the cover. So I bought it and played it first. I was hooked! For a beginner, you can't ask for a better DVD!",1361923200,,225,3.6875
2412398,3,B000BBOU68,"I bought this CD after reading several reviews that said Vanessa was clear and easy to understand.  What I wanted was to learn the basic samba step.  The first one.  Samba!  Vanessa has you go to a ""basic samba"" that is just bouncing from side to side.  Not Samba!  I even bought the second CD hoping that in the more advanced class I would learn it.  Nope.  So now I have two CDs on Brazilian Samba and still no idea how to do that first step.  Just not the right video for me.  If you want to learn how to do a grapevine, this is fine, but actual Samba dancing, it is not.  Sorry Vanessa.",1345852800,,590,4.043478260869565
2412399,1,B000BBOU68,"The only way this would be a workout is if you are in the cardiac care unit on a respirator. Instead of wasting your money on this video run up and down the stairs in your home once. What you see in the trailor is the fastest part of the video. I'm 57, took one zumba class and loved it so much I thought I would try another dance workout video. Well this one was certainly a waste of my money. I should have taken the ten dollars and gone for ice cream. I will say this, she certainly goes over and over and over every step-- no need to rewind, she practices enough that you get it. When it was finished I thought gee that must have been the basic instructional part, now the workout will begin, but no that was it the end of the video. Your best bet is to rent it if possible since you won't need to play it twice.",1316736000,3,816,3.9515151515151516
2412400,5,B000BBOU68,"I went to a class to learn samba, but left after 30 min because the instructor didn't explain the steps.  Now keep in mind I didn't know anything about Samba.  So I purchased this video.  It is definitely for beginners.  If you already know the basics of Samba, this is not for you.  But if you're a beginner like me, it is perfect! :)",1312070400,,335,4.171875
2412401,3,B000BBOU68,"The work out is pretty good but after doing it a couple times it pretty easy, so the best way to challenged yourself would be to speed up. The film quality wasn't great the audio was wacko and off which I didn't like. Not that I bought the DVD for the audio but i've been turning the volume off when I've been playing it. So workout is fun, simple to do just bad filming.",1266105600,,371,4.027027027027027
2412402,3,B000BBOU68,"This dance routine isn't bad, its even fun for the first few times, but I found it too easy. It's nice that you learn everything at the first time, but its not challenging and motivating enough. I have no latin-dance experience and still found the steps too easy and there is only like 5 or 6 of them. If you have some dance experience even with other dance styles I recommend something more advanced.",1253059200,,401,4.4324324324324325
2412403,5,B000BBOU68,"Vanessa Isaac is a good instructor and the others in the video are cute and fun to watch.  The workout is a fun, cardio but low-impact program.  I enjoyed watching the scenes from beautiful Salvador, Bahia in Brazil where I had spent a month.  It brought back wonderful memories.  My sister did the workout with me and she liked it. I gave it to her as a gift and she looks forward to using it on a regular basis.",1247356800,,413,4.189873417721519
2412414,1,B000BBOU68,"I really do not enjoy this dvd at all and find it pretty boring.  It is annoying that the instructor felt it necessary to begin the workout section with a bunch of talking so to even start exercising you have to forward a bit.  I am not a dancer at all, but have taken a few dance lessons over the years (many years) & I find that I don't like to repeat the same steps over & over & over again.  I keep thinking ""Move on, already, we've got it!""  I guess I feel that if a person is having trouble with a particular step then go back & try it again, but eventually you will get it & just want a fun workout without practicing again & again.  In the end I don't feel like I have gotten a real workout, nor do I really have any fun since we kept repeating the same steps.  It is very disappointing as I do feel like this instructor does have a lot of knowledge to impart & we could have a lot of fun while exercising with her but I feel dummied down to in the end.  Really, don't waste your money if you are wanting to make exercising to these type of dvds a habit as it won't take but a couple of times before this routine gets old.",1224979200,4,1130,3.908296943231441
2412415,4,B000BBOU68,"I came into this expecting a samba-inspired dance workout rather than samba proper, and so I was certainly not disappointed.  The setting is charming, the costumes are lovely, and Vanessa herself is engaging.  She cues well and has an easy instruction style that makes her easy to follow.  Her other demonstrators stay well synced with her and each bring their own personality in without distracting from her instruction.

The warm-up portion is effective, comprised of simple dance-y steps that work well to loosen everything up.  The work-out proper is energetic and keeps moving well, if not particularly varied.  There's a lot of repetition that makes it easy for beginners to pick up, though it may become a little boring for more experienced viewers.  The cool-down is easy and relaxing, although the inclusion of floorwork is a little startling.

Overall, I really enjoyed this workout.  It's repetitive but still fun, and certainly works up a sweat once you get into it.  I look forward to more videos in this series!",1224028800,2,1025,5.011834319526627

2412417,3,B000BBOU68,"I really like Vanessa's stage presence and her dance was fun, but I don't think it had enough chreography to give me a good workout.  This is great for people at the very beginning level since these moves are very basic and unintimidating.  I'm going to try her other DVD and see if any of 'em challenge me and make me sweat.",1216684800,,325,4.225806451612903
2412418,2,B000BBOU68,I found the video ok.  It's a bit repetitive but very easy to learn for a beginner like me.,1204070400,,91,3.789473684210526
2412419,4,B000BBOU68,"This is a good exercise dvd but if you want to do ""hardcore"" samba, look into something else.",1200268800,,93,4.222222222222222
2412420,4,B000BBOU68,"What a great workout!  I really enjoyed this one by Vanessa Isaac.  I have to say that the background set design is the BEST I've seen in a workout video.  They even had extras, it's very cute to watch the extras react to the dancers!  It's filmed outdoors in a Brazilian courtyard setting with live drums.

Vanessa is very personable and cues well.  I believe the workout time clocked in at around 33 minutes?  There's a bit of marching in place between samba moves, but not for too long.  Vanessa shows 4 or so different samba steps, breaking them down at half tempo, then it's full steam ahead.

The dancers were fun to watch and I enjoyed seeing the dancers put their own individual styles on the movements.  It's a low impact workout that's a bit tough to manage on carpet, but it's not too bad and I was able to work up a sweat.

The only drawbacks that I had with this workout:
* a little too much TIFTing (that's vidiot speak for Taking It From the Top) but not so much that I got bored.  A couple of more samba steps might have been nice
* near the end of the cooldown, Vanessa has her dancers lie supine on the floor to do back stretches....I felt that this would have been better achieved standing.  I also don't recall there being any leg stretches in the cooldown, which is a must after all of that dancing (I might be mistaken on this point, however...it's been a week since I've done this one).

I ordered Samba Party 2 and am eagerly awaiting it.  I recommend Samba Party 1.",1197936000,,1490,4.309352517985611
2412421,5,B000BBOU68,"A fun, different sort of exercise video--it's real dancing instead of aerobics, but you will work up a sweat. Easy to learn steps and excellent cuing, a very nice change of pace from other aeorbics videos.",1191974400,,205,4.722222222222222

2412434,3,B000BBOU68,"Ok, so I almost feel bad giving this three stars, because I DO enjoy it-it's a fun little dance routine that does combine some traditional samba moves, and it will get your heart rate up...but I do have some issues.

Vanessa is VERY thorough in going over each move. In fact, too thorough, in my opinion. You will go over one move several times, then go to the next one several times, then back to the first one several times, and so on. It keeps progressing like this, which is great the first few times you do it, but after awhile it can be boring because you've learned the steps already, and there is no option to skip the ""instruction"" part and just go to the dance. This is actually my problem with a lot of dance dvd's-it's nice to have thorough cues the first few times you do it, but after awhile it just gets annoying and boring. And-there aren't that many ""moves"" on here to begin with, so you almost feel as if she is just trying to fill in time by repeating everything a thousand times.

So, it is fun to do, and will get your heart rate up a bit. But after about 4-5 times, you may get sick of it. I do love samba though, so I hope she will release another video sometime soon!",1182384000,16,1191,4.173913043478261
2412435,5,B000BBOU68,"I had been looking for a way to exersize with a small toddler underfoot, something that would be fun, not too time-consuming and could be done indoors.  This was a perfect solution!  I love Vanessa Isaac's style and personality.  She's really easy to follow and learn from.  I started by going through the ""learn the moves"" section of the DVD and then did the workout and I caught on really fast, but I also improved over the weeks too.  This will get you sweating, give you a good 30-40 min workout and it's fun to do!  If you get tired of just listening to drums, it's all done in a simple rhythm that you can dance to with your own music.  I would recommend doing your own stretches for a few minutes before starting up (or start the complete workout and stretch while Vanessa is doing the introduction).  I noticed a difference in my body within a couple of days!  My stomach started firming up, my legs got in great shape, and I started getting compliments within a month that I was looking thin!  You can't beat that.  This is definitely the way to go if you're starting out learning Samba style fitness too, it's a good workout but not as taxing as her second album.  I would recommend buying this, do it for at least a month, and then add vol. 2 a couple of days a week after that for some variety and to improve your stamina even more.  I love this workout and you will too!  My daughter loves watching the workout too... she even waves her arms around and ""talks"" at the TV while I'm working out, so it's fun for both of us.",1179705600,9,1534,4.28125

Steps presented here were simple, and the instructor goes over and over. I am hooked, because I feel like I am dancing at a club or something rather than working out at a gym-- yet I sweat and got a great workout.

The only complain I have is that the DVD is rather short (something like 30 minutes, including both the warm-up and the cool-down.) Plus as I wrote above, she goes over and over the same steps, so you don't get to learn many different steps. (You only learn six movements.)

The steps themselves are not at all difficult to master with a little practice. However, as the instructor increases the speed you really get a terrific workout. Because the steps are not terribly complicated you can really get into the rhythm and let your body feel the music instead of intellectually concentrating to do the moves correctly. You can have a good time with this whether you are just beginning to exercise again or are in great shape and just want to have fun. Be patient. Chances are you are doing this in the privacy of your own home. Nobody is watching you. Just go with it til you are a Samba Diva.",1175299200,20,763,4.536231884057971

It was very easy to learn all the steps since she isolates each one in a separate viewing option, then practices each step in slow, or half time, then at full speed. If you review these basic steps before viewing the actual work out, you are ready to go! Some have said this workout is boring, but I find it fun, fun, fun. With a solid foundation with all the steps, which are repeated in each rerun of the entire dance, you can just loose yourself in the rhythm, add your own arm movement variations, swing, sway, sweat and forget your cares. The rhythm is infectious, the directions are very clear, the dance leader has a pleasant demeanor, and hey, I worked up the best sweat I have in a while to a dance video. I know this will be one of my favorites. The workout itself, once you learn the moves, is about a half hour long.

For me it was a piece of cake, and I could barely call it exercise, but it was fun and I like it for a change of pace. Or its good if you have a cold or something, where you can't do a super blast workout, this one is good on those types of days. The dance aspect makes it fun.  The instructor is very pleasant and you really like her style.

You burn some calories, but it's not strenuous. Seems to be great for easy days or beginners or if you want an extra workout added to your other workouts (like, if you want to do 2 videos instead of just 1). Also if you are very overweight, its a fun tape to start getting into exercise.

I would recommend it to anybody who is open to learn dance moves and enjoy the music. I feel it's a breeze of fresh air to practice a very nice dance routine while burning some calories. You can see the care to modify the movements for those who might not be flexible or don't know how to dance that much.

Again, it's pure beat and I love the live music. Very unique!",1371600000,,594,4.390909090909091
