5186532,4,B008WAM2W4,"His band is great, some long term members  like Ed Earley and new members. Enjoyed seeing Elvin's Red Dog. Were the other two red guitars the ones Juscawitz (probably didn't spell that right) from Gibson made for him trying to create an Elvin Bishop model?
Would like a little more documentation of the gear

Elvin's tone is incredible",1362614400,,335,4.758620689655173
5186533,5,B008WAM2W4,"A very well shot and edited concert DVD. The songs are a great representation of Elvin's career. Been waiting for a Bishop DVD forever and this was worth thr wait. A must for Bishop fans an if you're a blues fan, it woud go nicely with your collection",1359590400,,251,4.25
5186534,5,B008WAM2W4,Been a fan of Elvin's for over 45 years and I'm just glad that YOU ALL finally get a chance to see and enjoy what WE ALL have known for years on what fun an Elvin Bishop Concert is! Great fun! I'm a hard rock and metal guy but Elvin Bishop is still my favorite musician! ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY!,1359504000,,289,3.9152542372881354
5186535,5,B008WAM2W4,"Well I haven't done a review in a little while (since 2011), but this DVD is really fantastic! I saw Elvin many times in New York's Cafe Au Go Go, while growing up in NY, with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He was the first white person I ever saw do the BB King trill! Elvin is an excellent entertainer and the actual set is diverse, interesting and contains some great standard Blues such as Muddy Water's ""Little Brown Bird"" and others. Bishop's band also includes Ed Earley, the once dancing trombone player, who is just fantastic, he toured with Albert King in Japan in the 1980s and also once played with Little Milton and others. He is a gem. The whole DVD is well produced, laid back and has a lot of diverse blues influences, including Delta and Piedmont Blues. Elvin and Bob Welsh handle the guitar section very well and the whole set is just delightful, you can also see that Elvin spent some time around the Allman Brothers! The production quality is great, but I still would have liked a Blu Ray version! You can sit through this DVD many times and it's never tedious! The interview is just great, a highlight, very professional and insightful. I really love it. Elvin went to the University of Chicago where he was a Physics major and he also met Paul Butterfield there, in the heartland of urban blues! He comes across as a down to earth lovely example of my generation's Blues Boom's treasures. As we would say in Australia; ""Good on you Elvin!"". I keep singing ""That's My Thing"", it's infectious!",1352332800,8,1515,4.553113553113553
5186536,5,B008WAM2W4,"This is an excellent DVD. The production work is great. It is like being at the show. Elvin Bishop looked like he was having a great time, and the audience was too.",1351987200,4,164,4.15625
5186537,5,B008WAM2W4,"I was at the recording and I also own a copy of this DVD. This is some the very best production work I have ever seen anywhere. My only issue is the order of the songs on the DVD are very different from the live show, so that makes it a little confusing for me. That should not be an issue for anyone else, because the camera work is outstanding! You will truly believe you are there live at the Club Fox when you watch this DVD!",1351987200,4,429,3.942528735632184
5186538,5,B008WAM2W4,"Oh my gosh, this show was so much fun, the music was excellent, the venue was suberb,  A great crowd.  Just a memorable time all around.  And to have the video to listen to and relive that fun fun night.  It makes you feel like you are there.  Great addition to any collection. Elvin can do the blues!",1351987200,3,301,4.120689655172414
5186539,5,B008WAM2W4,"Before this DVD, I only knew Elvin Bishop and his hit song ""I fooled around and fell in love"" and now with this Live in Concert DVD I was able to enjoy his other hits in a live environment.  Great production and very entertaining!",1351900800,2,230,4.2272727272727275
5186540,5,B008WAM2W4,"Believe it or not I had never seen Elvin Bishop perform.  I've always liked his music though.  Now after seeing this video, I not only like his music, I like him as an entertainer.  A lot of the veteran entertainers are just ""phoning in"" their performance.  Elvin still looks like he's having a good time, and you can see the audience is.

I love the video!",1351900800,3,357,4.348484848484849

8531374,2,B008WAM2W4,"Elvin Bishop has been a landmark contributor to American blues and rock. Owning many of his albums and having seen him play in his prime the DVD is a disappointment. The show was at a small venue in South San Francisco or Redwood City, can't remember off hand. The film crew was semi amateur. The band is not tight.  Elvin is geriatric, and plays his hits at half tempo. He is old and grey and way beyond it.  Hoping for a film that would capture his greatness for the ages but found a ragged and shabby performance that mocks his true gift to music lovers.",1467763200,,557,4.295238095238095

8531379,5,B008WAM2W4,"If you're not having a good time watching and listening to Elvin, you need an intervention.  Great, great, guitar player, with a personality and stage presence to match.  Elvin may act a bit hayseed, but he isn't.  Very thoughtful and intelligent, his story is most interesting.  Play this disc, take off your hat, drink a little this, smoke a little that, and have a good time!",1403654400,3,378,4.681818181818182
8531380,3,B008WAM2W4,we love Elvin and looked forward to watching this DVD.  That being said the sound quality compared to Blu Ray is terrible. There is no set up for 5.1 surround sound like we have become use to listening to. The first part of the DVD the sound is so bad you can't really hear stuff he was chatting about.  Elvin is really a storyteller at heart but we missed most of it.  Did the sound man come in late that day?  The end of it Elvin finally found his guitar and played his heart out....I guess the sound man finally showed up!,1370563200,,525,4.117647058823529
8531381,5,B008WAM2W4,very good  brings back good memories of when i saw him back in the 76 with the marshall tucker band,1367280000,,99,3.95
