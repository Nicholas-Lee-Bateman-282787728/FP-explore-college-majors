2079863,1,B0002DB52C,"Antonio Sabato Jr is the best actor in this film. It has a really stupid plot and ending. It's about a killer with an axe that offs his victims one by one. The motive behind this is that the spiky haired kid in this film is mistreated by all his classmates for his weird seance's and evil cults. His behavior is so strange that he makes the guidance counselor very nervous. After getting run off the road by one of his schoolmates, all his old classmates die one by one by this mysterious killer. While in the meanwhile, Antonio Sabato Jr (the detective) in this movie investigates and does a polygraph on everyone. There is not that much gore or nudity in this film and the ending was very bizarre. It was completely stupid.",1094515200,3,725,4.417910447761194

8026672,3,B0002DB52C,"3 stars because there is one thing I find really likable about the movie and I guess this credit should go to the make up and wardrobe team. Josh Hammond is really hot with liberty spikes and eyeliner. Sadly he has only very few scenes and then turns into some kind of demon monster thing. Should of kept him like he was and took the movie in a more realistic dark goth serial killer sort of direction, would of made all the difference in the world.",1446422400,,449,4.232558139534884

8026674,4,B0002DB52C,"I actually didn't think it was too bad. I kind of followed it. I have definately seen worse movies. Yes, the picture and camera angels seemed kind of amateurish at times I found the story quite intriguing. The ending song is really catchy ( I like it and have been trying to find it else where.) Though, just because I don't want anybody to put their money into something that they don't think they would like, or juts want to save a couple of bucks. It is only the Netflix Instant thing). It is understandable why many think this is a bad movie. I really do like it though.",1306800000,,574,4.275229357798165
8026675,5,B0002DB52C,"I Only Wanted This Movie For That Song At The End....lol
I Cant Find It Anywhere. So I Bought The Movie!",1199577600,,104,4.0
8026676,1,B0002DB52C,"A goth kid makes a crappy 5 minute movie that everyone laughs at so he goes nuts. He gets into a beef with a jock and takes off in his car being chased by the jock. Eventually goth kid drives over a cliff. One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next.

Now, forget you read all that because you are never going to want to sit through this dreck. I took the bullet for you. Stephen J. Cannell, who wrote Dead Above Ground, used to make cheesy tv shows like the A-Team and Rip Tide. The A-Team was Shakespeare compared to this movie. It has a plot so cliched and hackneyed a first year film student wouldn't write it. Atrocious dialog and God-awful acting round out this movie's demerits. Stay far away from this movie.",1158796800,8,790,4.266666666666667
8026677,1,B0002DB52C,"Unfortunately, it's a horror movie, not a comedy, but it might as well be...I have one thought: I would think that, after hundreds of thousands of cliche, unbelievably predictable B horror movies have been made over and over, all following the same formulaic scripting, and all containing the same horrendous over-the-top cheeseball acting, that someone would say to these hopeless directors/producers, ""gee, ya know, we've seen this before--about a bajillion times, and it still sucks!""  This movie is BAD...very, very bad.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I usually enjoy bad horror movies.  I think I may have even dropped a few IQ points having been subjected to this trash.  The only thing that you may get out of it is the hilarity of making fun of it---this begs for the Mystery Science Theater 3000/Svengoolie treatment.  Otherwise, a total waste of time.  Just avoid it!",1111881600,5,893,4.959731543624161
8026678,3,B0002DB52C,"We have to remember that even though Stephen J. Cannell is the one we can hold responsible for THE A-TEAM, he also gave us the classic series WISE GUY.  Now, DEAD ABOVE GROUND is certainly not in the same league, but it has some deft humorous moments and I found myself intrigued by just who was doing what to who.  Where else can you find Corbin Bernsen being offed in the first ten minutes and having to run through a house screaming like a woman?  Where else can you find THE WILD WILD WEST's Robert Conrad looking pathetically inept as a screenwriter?  And poor Antonio Sabato, Jr., who really should stick to modeling underwear..and all in one movie.  And once again, Cannell (who also appeared in THE CONTRACT) has a meaty role that proves he's not as fortunate as director Sydney Pollack in actually having any acting talent?  All in one movie!  It's no worse than the countless other ""thrillers"" we've seen, so I'm gonna be nice and give it three stars anyway.",1110240000,4,968,4.5606936416184976
8026679,1,B0002DB52C,"Note to Stephen Cannell: please, just stop. Even when you were at the top of your game, doing things like 21 Jump Street, no one would have called you a genius. And now, you've slipped down the ladder, Stephen. If this is the best thing you can come up with, I would suggest a career change.

This movie is all about an aging Hollywood Screenwriter and his daughter. It features all the typical stereotypes, a Director who is sleeping with a Bimbo Starlet, the Kid From the Wrong Side of Town who wants to date the Screenwriter's daughter. It's like a really bad combination of ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""The Player"", trying to be a horror movie.

The concept and the writing are just plain dead. It makes you wonder, when Stephen Cannell came up with the title ""Dead Above Ground"", was he describing himself?",1106956800,,804,4.537931034482758
8026680,1,B0002DB52C,"I know this is a straight to video release. It also has some familiar faces in it. But it's horrible. I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer and say that Antonio Sabato Jr was absolutely horrible. It seemed like he was reading his lines off cue cards. Granted what he had to work with was a joke to start out with, but come on. Make it even halfway believable. This is nothing more than a very bad B-movie. In this case, the ""B"" in b-movie truely stands for ""BAD!"". Don't waste your time. What a disappointment.",1096934400,3,528,4.3979591836734695
