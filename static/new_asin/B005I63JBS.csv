8474277,5,B005I63JBS,"Our girl has been reading from age 2 and is fully reading BOB books series with ease, yet I was having trouble with her converting to solo-reading into the next genre of early readers.  eg.  Clifford the Big Red Dog series, Mercer Mayer's Little Critter books, Dr. Seuss books, Amelia Bedelia books.  We have also been using about 5 LeapFrog DVDs for the past 2 years.  In my search for something to help in the educational DVD department, I was not happy with what I found.  Rock N Learn has poke-my-eyes out graphics and the Preschool Prep DVDs are similarly low budget and mind-numbing for a kid who knows quality graphics and audio.

In my search for a great product, I came across Read-eez and then did a little research.  The guy who created this is a musician who puts words to great music.  The words he places on the screen come up in rhythm to his tunes.  What I really love about this is that kids are so programmed to watch DVDs and videos and follow the characters.  In this case, the characters become the words.  The words are doing the movement quite similarly to when one reads a book, with tempo, with rhythm.  It's quietly brilliant!

What I did not expect from this DVD is my child pulling books off of her bookshelf and putting them to song.  She knows so many of the books we have been reading for the past 4 years and she started singing them in opera!  It was incredible.  I could imagine her reading novels now with a symphony in the background creating setting the stage for the story line to unfold.

Now, the best part of all of this is the 2 year old, just starting to recognize words, knows his letters.  When the DVD is playing, he watches intently and taps his legs in rhythm to the story.

It's beautiful to see the emergence of young readers through such a wonderful media.  I very much look forward to more products from Read-eez!  This is a brilliant media with many possibilities for expanding the educational DVD choices!",1328400000,,1959,4.461971830985916
