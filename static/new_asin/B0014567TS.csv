8254510,1,B0014567TS,The item was not what I wanted and the description was not helpful. It did not describe what acctual episodes were on the dvd. Then to get a refund it would have cost me more then i payed for shipping to re send it back so I would have lost money. Now I'm stuck trying to resell the item to get my money back,1461801600,2,308,3.828125

8254513,4,B0014567TS,"NOT a ""Customer review from the Amazon Vine tm Program (What's this?)"" -

Instead it's a review by someone who actually seeks out, watches, and knows quite a bit about the subject; not just someone who responded to some kind of offer in a genre they otherwise know little and care less about!  Since SO many ""reviewers"" of the initial volume of this series seemed totally unfamilliar with what this is:

1)  It's adapted from a manga by CLAMP.  ( Anyone attempting to review it should at least be familliar with both the terms ""manga"" and ""CLAMP"". )

2)  The Japanese group of female manga artists CLAMP are noted for their distinct-yet-varying artistic styles; therefore the characters in xxxHOLiC are NOT deformed - they're SUPPOSED to look the way they do to stress the unreality of the world they inhabit.  Since in the respective manga xxxHOLiC and TSUBASA - RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE occupy parallel and connected storylines, and therefore share not a few characters, they naturally also share similar character designs.

3)  That connection so far plays no part in the current adaptation of this particular series; but IS a feature of Funamation's so-called CLAMP Double Feature that combines two short theatrical versions of both xxxHOLiC and TSUBASA in a set containing a pair of DVD's.  The manga includes frequent references/homages to most of CLAMP's previous works as well.

4)  Since xxxHOLiC ( pronounced ""holic"" ) deals with the supernatural, its color palette is naturally dark and somber, with designs of both characters and backgrounds reminiscent of those in CLAMP's X.

5)  Likewise, the ""too-cute (also annoying) bouncy stuffed-animal-like object"", as one reviewer described Black Mokona, is a character who will be very familliar to the legions of fans of the manga and anime of CLAMP's Magic Knight Rayearth and more recently, TSUBASA series.  Mokona's antics here need no further comment; except maybe, ""Puu...""

6)  Although hardly an acceptable ""role model"" due to her drinking, smoking, and apparant listlisness, the Dimentional Witch Yuko is a typical representative of the colorful and distinctive characters which inhabit most CLAMP works.  Her relationship as mentor to Watanuki is somewhat reminiscent of that between the equally unorthodox Icchan and Misaki in CLAMP's Angelic Layer.

7)  Watanuki's incessant over-the-top whining, though admittedly annoying, is an important part of his character and serves to further distinguish him from his ""opposite"", the stoic Doumeki.  It's not at all different from the frequent and equally violent verbal outbursts of Hideki Motosuwa, protagonist of CLAMP's Chobits, who is also in the habit of talking to himself like Watanuki does.

This 4-episode volume furthers the relationship of Watanuki as a ""part-time employee"" at Yuko's mysterious house/place of business.  One night he discovers that it is not only spirits he can see that others can not when he happens across an oden street shop run by a father-and-son pair of foxes.  The familliar tale of the Monkey's Paw is retold when it becomes obvious that just about any artifact may turn up in Yuko's ""treasure warehouse"".  Yuko shows a more up-to-date stylish side of herself as she goes forth to help a young woman ""cure"" a bad habit most of the readers of this should identify with.  And Watanuki gets his own first ""client"" in the form of a demanding rain sprite.  ( Though as usual it's Yuko who gets the payment! )

As a CLAMP fan of long standing, I'm so far thoroughly enjoying the rather lesiurely journey through this latest of their magical worlds!",1238112000,23,3586,5.092465753424658

8254515,5,B0014567TS,"I first found out about XXXHolic when I was offered it by the Amazon Vine program.  I received the first DVD collection.  I also have many students in my class from China, Korea and Japan so I was already getting more exposure to Manga than I have ever had before.  So since I enjoyed the DVD, I started buying the Manga books, I had also found Suki Volume 1 in a used book bin and enjoyed that series too.  Now I am a XXXHolic nut who has read all 12 volumes out right now and of course, I need the DVDs too!  This collection was quite good and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It gets better when you have read the Manga too.  I highly recommend this series.  It's wonderful and turned me onto Clamp and Manga.",1215820800,2,710,4.094202898550725
8254516,4,B0014567TS,"I started buying the xxxHolic dvds because I absolutely love the manga.  The anime seems to stray a little from the order in which the events are told in the books, and some relatively minor details seem to have changed; but nothing to complain about in my opinion.

Overall, I enjoyed it very much.  I think that the casting is good (Japanese vocals only - I usually don't watch the dub) and fit the characters pretty well.  Does a pretty good job of capturing what I like about the visual styles and effects that CLAMP utilizes so well.

My only major complaint is that there are not enough special features on the dvd.  There are clean op and ed (I think) and a scene gallery, but I have come to expect, quite frankly, more behind the scenes stuff like cast interviews and creator commentary as in Cowboy Bebop or Suzumiya Haruhi releases (to name just two)

Overall I'd say a fan of the story will enjoy, and a newcomer to the world of xxxHolic will want to stick around for more.",1212624000,4,984,4.403314917127072
