3804475,5,B001UV4XIS,"[This review is for the Theatrical Release.]

The Theater Experience:

I went to the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II at my local AMC theater with a theater-full of wild and rowdy young men and women, boys & girls.

Theater Experience:  Briefly, I'm sure that this same situation was repeated throughout the country.  Potter fans dressed up in their favorite school colors from Hogwarts, carrying wands and making like Hermione, Harry and Ron.  The theater did a quick giveaway promotion, a short costume contest and lots of cheering and yelling before the show started.  The place was packed.  Some special fans got their 3D glasses Potter style (round rims).  Even with advance tickets I waited a couple of hours to get in which was annoying, but the infectious crowd lifted my spirits.

The Review:

The Deathly Hallows picks up where the first movie leaves off.  The Part Two film does not stand on its own - you have to see Part One.  Also, even better, read the book of the same title first, so you can fill in the blanks.

Unlike Part One, I saw no discernible blanks for Part Two (in a mental book comparison).  The film was all about Harry and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (aka ""You Know Who"").  Not a lot of character development in this last film, since you should know who they all are by now!

Harry is much rougher and grittier in this version.  The laughing, smiling children from Year One are not there now.  If anything they're in a struggle for their lives with You Know Who, Death Eaters and Dementors flying about.  The action scenes with the giants, the spiders and chunks of castle blowing out into the sky was horrific.

The dead bodies and blood, the horror of the battlefield, make for some pretty grim yet realistic battle scenes lifted from the Rowling novel.

There are humorous scenes as well - watch for Ron and Hermione's kiss right after they accomplish one of their Horcrux missions.  I really wanted to see more scenes with Harry and Ginny but it was not meant to be.  Neville Longbottom's scenes were scene-stealers.  The actor really captured the essence of this character.

Memorable scene:  You Know Who's confrontation with Harry;  the duplication of the scene with Bellatrix (""not my daughter you b*tch!) was amazing.

Bottom Line:  Great tribute to the last book.  They could have really screwed this one up!  It's not perfect, but I give it five big stars for its spirit, not dwelling too much on any one scene or situation,  great pacing and dialogue.  Highly recommended.

3804476,1,B001UV4XIS,Yawn. Another overrated HP movie by hack director Yates. This one was even worst than Part 1. This is one of those movies that critics vastly over-rate and proves their opinion is worth. No one can explain why they think Harry Potter is a compelling character. He is boring and vapid.,1310688000,15,284,4.588235294117647
3804477,5,B001UV4XIS,"My husband and I have watched every Harry Potter movie in the theater; I however, am the only one who has read the entire series.  We have differing opinions when it came to the films.  From a movie standpoint all the films were really good.  Yes the young actors weren't as seamless with their characters as the more mature ones were, but the magic of the movies allowed one to look past that.  What always bothered me was the disconnect between the book and the movie. I remember complaining to my husband and he said `I am so glad I never read the books because I adore the movies.' Hmpf.  What I also noticed was as the movies took longer to come out, more time had lapsed between reading and watching.  This made the movies that much better.  I can say that this last Harry Potter was excellent. I read the Deathly Hollows the day it came out, and haven't picked up a Harry Potter since.  We watched Part I yesterday then followed it up with Part II...

This was a strong ending for the series, which really, is the best thing the directing/movie makers could have done. At the end you are left wanting more, but left satisfied that it closed so powerfully.  You can tell how much the actors have matured, both in their acting and ability to fully immerse themselves in the characters. I didn't see it in 3D (sometimes makes me sick) but I loved the special effects.  Like the book it is sad.... Really sad and there were people openly crying in the theater. The music (as with every Potter film before) was phenomenal, really added to the creepiness/sadness/joy of the different scenes.

I highly recommend seeing this in theaters. We might go back next weekend just to see the difference in 3D. Enjoy!",1310688000,15,1708,4.491909385113269
3804478,5,B001UV4XIS,"The decade journey closes ( longer for those of us on board with the release of the Philosopher's Stone ). Yates , WB and the cast have done a fine job ( w/ both parts), changes from the books made were less painful than earlier film cuts, although the occasional monologuing of exposition occurs, like Harry explaining wand lore and who the elder wand belongs to... May they didn't do enough of this, even, I thought Harry's on-screen Horcrux Math was lacking, if I hadn't read the material I questioned how it was condensed here. Harry actually says "" there's one Horcrux left ... I hope the less literate members of the audience could keep up with these potentially confusing leaps.  That complaint aside...The scenes in this story were ready made for cinema ... Breaking into and out of the Gringott's wizard bank, which even on screen is established as the most secure place in the very first adventure. Other homages to the decade of Potter history are made ofcourse... Basilisk anyone? Again I say the cast has done a super job in making us care about these characters , good and evil for what amounts to a 16 hour experience ... Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are over the top as expected, but subtile performances are in the mix like, Dame Maggie Smith's at times elegant Prof. McGonagall portrayal, briefly many other Hogwarts cameos ( surprising how many students are still onboard from Year One). As for Harry, Ron and Hermione, they may have delivered their best work to date, but they are so comfortable with each other as with the characters that is seems pretty effortless ... Although I wonder if even they can make the distinction at this point .... Mischief Managed, y'all .",1310688000,,1693,4.700336700336701
3804479,5,B001UV4XIS,Let me tell you that this is was is to be called a movie!!!! on of the best movie that I've ever saw in my entire life!!!!! just wonderful!!! excellent saga!!! i will never forget all the moments I went to the theaters to see the new harry potter movie!!!! I'm gonna miss that!!!!!! amazing!! just awesome!!!!,1310601600,,309,4.43859649122807
3804480,5,B001UV4XIS,"I was never a big Harry Potter fan. I didn't read the books and only saw The Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters at the time because I was bored one weekend. So I had pretty much gone all this time without seeing the other movies in their entirety. With a screening of The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 quickly approaching, I took the initiative to watch the first seven movies over the course of a few days to be prepared and I'm very glad that I did. The movies do in fact get darker as you progress through them and seem to get better with each sequel. The one thing I didn't like was that The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, and The Half-Blood Prince all have similar endings that just leave you hanging. One of the main characters, usually Harry, blurts out something like, ""We're going to have to go do this,"" and then there's this long, winding panoramic shot before the credits roll and that's it. However, watching all the movies at once had me at a bit of an advantage since there wasn't much of a wait between movies. Everyone has their favorite Harry Potter movie and I'm still a bit partial to The Prisoner of Azkaban but in my opinion both halves of The Deathly Hallows are the best in the series.

I'm not entirely sure if it was just following so close to the book or what, but The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has an excellent sense of perspective. Hermione holding a stray hair and the scene at the bank where the guard begins to suspect Harry, Ron, and Hermione to be imposters are the prime examples that come to mind. The way it drew attention to certain items or characters through the use of those things being in-focus while everything else around them was out of focus just really made a simple scene so much more interesting. It made you try and take notice of the surroundings a bit more since they seemed to be just as important as what the main characters were going through at times.

The special effects are extremely impressive, as well. The war at Hogwarts and Harry's battle with Voldemort are probably the most substantial scenes that come to mind while the death eaters always use some fairly eye-catching effects, but I found the white dragon to be the crown jewel of the special effects department. Most of the extravagant creatures that have played an important role in the series have generally looked the best (Buckbeak and Thestrals come to mind) compared to some of the other computer generated effects in the franchise. The white dragon in The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 just looks really spectacular though. It didn't look like it was obviously created on a computer like many computer generated effects seem to and almost came off as being flesh and bone or at least as realistic as a dragon could be.

Does a film like this have any weaknesses? Probably, but they'll mostly go unnoticed. That's not necessarily a bad thing either. You'll be so caught up in watching this ten year event come to an end and piecing together those final pieces of the puzzle that if there is anything wrong with this finale you won't even notice. I've always felt that it always looked kind of funky whenever somebody rode a broomstick. At times it looks great and just as it should, but at others it just didn't look right. It looked a bit off in this one, but it's so brief that it should hardly even count as a nitpick.

I feel like amongst all of the adventures you've tagged along for with Harry, Ron, and Hermione and all of the characters and creatures they've come into contact with in the span of eight films that Snape is still easily the most intriguing aspect of the entire story. His agenda is certainly something worth paying attention to and the way everything he does falls into place after you learn what you do about him in this movie is something really extraordinary. That isn't to say that other characters don't have their moments because they do, but Professor Severus Snape is that unexpected adhesive that brings all of the films together and gives the entire franchise an even greater meaning.

Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is essentially everything you want it to be and that's more than a satisfying conclusion for all Harry Potter fans big and small. The special effects are fantastic and the cast is at the top of their game. It's intense and gripping while part of you will want to see this film last forever. That's probably the most difficult part; saying goodbye to these characters you've spent the last ten years getting to know. Overall Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is just a brilliant conclusion to a wonderful franchise.",1310601600,2,4610,4.56280193236715
3804481,5,B001UV4XIS,"Let me begin by offering unadulterated praise for everyone involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the last film of the highly-successful Harry Potter franchise. One can not critique this movie with anything but praise for the filmmaking of the last Harry Potter film is the reason we all fell in love with Harry Potter books to begin with - it's pure magic.

The technology for creating movies was invented for the purpose of taking written stories and setting them not simply into images, but breathing life into them. Moving pictures should not only move on the screen, but move the viewer into action. During the screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, people applauded, laughed, screamed, stomped, and cried (or at least got misty eyed).

Seeing this film in 3D added to the feeling of being in the movie, being a part of the tremendously rich and complex Wizarding World originally created by J.K. Rowling.

Simply put, this film is thrilling to watch and causes awe upon the viewing of it. The battle scenes in the last 30-35 minutes of the movie are some of the best action/adventure sequences I have ever seen on screen.

The art direction is impeccable. Every scene is done with class and style. Particularly impressive, are the scenes that contain material that can't be seen - an invisibility cloak, protective charms, etc. The special effects are probably the best in the series. As has been the case with special effects in the past Harry Potter films - from house elves to dementors to dragons - this film has plenty of surreal CGI. In HP8, your mind will not be able to believe your eyes - the CGI effects look real and, in 3D, they actually feel real too. It is safe to say that HP8 captures the menagerie of CGI creatures from all previous films, adds several new ones, and perfects all effects.

The cinematography by Eduardo Serra is fantastic. It is better than even in the last Deathly Hallows film.

The soundtrack is once again by Alexandre Desplat, who scored the first Deathly Hallows film. And what a difference his eerie take is from his predecessors - Nicholas Hooper, Patrick Doyle, and John Williams. The music is like a fourth dimension of the film and enriches the film tremendously.

The script, as six of the others in the franchise, was written by Steve Kloves, and he makes sure that the spirit of the books lives in the film. The script gives a few hints as to the events of the previous seven movies, but obviously, can not serve as a cliff notes version of all the events. I suggest reacquainting oneself with the broad strokes of the book before heading to the theater for the latest in this franchise.

Sure, several creative licenses were taken for this film as is the case for any film ever made. Personally, I'd rather have seen the book's epilogue (coda) as an after-the-credits bit, instead of as part of the movie; overall though, I'd like to say that the film is impressive in its scope.

Where the HP franchise has always struggled, in my opinion, has been the acting. The adult actors have always been extraordinary, which should come as no surprise since the list of actors is a who's who in British cinema - Alan Rickman, Dame Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, John Hurt, and Jason Isaacs. The latest recruit to this excellent company is Kelly Macdonald, who whimsically plays the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw. While the adults have always been pitch perfect in their portrayals of the roles (except for Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, which he graciously amended once the fans complained), the child actors have struggled with their parts.

Therefore, it has always seemed unfair that the majority of screen time was devoted to the trio of young stars who first got cast simply because they bore a likeness to their characters. The trio - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint - have struggled to up the ante on their acting over the years, but it seems that they have finally figured out a successful formula for their craft. These three actors are still out-acted by the supporting actors in their midst, but at least it is no longer a ridiculous noticeable divide. This is as it should be - just as their characters have closed the magical ability divide with their teachers and parents, so too have the younger actors learned to stand their ground.

In the end, and this is surely the end of one of the most successful children's film franchise of our time, I would recommend not only watching this film, but watching this film on a big screen. It's a movie that would appeal to anyone who likes thrillers, dramas, fantasy, action, adventure, family films but, above all, being entertained in the theater.",1310342400,29,4834,4.7497020262216925

So today I looked to return it only to find out it had a 30 day max on returns. Very poor business approach. I suggest if the seller wants to limit returns to 30 days he should state, as it is sold, it has a 30 day max return and should be opened immediately and tested. That probably won't do much for sales but it would be straightforward.

Also, your sales and return process does not meet the usual doctrine of  Usual Expectations, not that I think you care a bit.

3805868,5,B001UV4XIS,I love the Harry Potter series. The books are better than the movies. Because the movies can't display certain feelings or emotions that the books can portray. However the movies are very well done. The last one is just spectacular. It's the conclusion two everything but he fought for as a child to becoming a young man who has to defend his world from evil. Lots of surprises and twists that were unusual. Who you thought was one of the evil people turns out to be the hero. It's not filled with like Disney mushy gushy everything's great usual junk. It's serious and people are dying it's real war and there's loss and heartbreak.  A heavy price is paid. Another reason to watch this film is because of that realism. But if you want the real sense of the emotions that the characters were going through read the book!!,1479513600,2,821,4.510067114093959

But, and my children agree with this, it was not meant for children.  The only way for the series and the movies to have been ok is if a child started reading the series at age 11 and read only one book a year and turned 18 while reading the last book or watching the last movie.  Otherwise, I liked it as much as the rest. But being so veiled in greif, pain, despair, longing. hopelessness, ad nauseum, I could not give it top marks.  Had the entire story been about adults and it broached this subject matter, I would have given it 5 stars.",1472083200,,675,4.090909090909091

I was disappointed in the moody and dreary ending at the train station.  The book, on the other hand, makes it clear that these are normal families, squabbling kids, concerned parents, and it also demonstrates the interrelatedness of some of the other characters (Lupin's son, for example).  Harry's choice about the elder wand is not the same in the book as in the movie, although the film made his decision irrevocable and definitive, which in real life would be far safer for him and for others.",1470787200,3,647,4.75

Therefor onto a DVD copy of the movie.  The advantage of BlueRay is that it uses UV light and different encoding.  I image my BlueRay player's last software update messed with the CODEC.  Well, DVD's use IR radiation and the CODEC's have been fairly stable.  I imagine that the DRM's are still in flux for BlueRay, and the player thinks I have a bootleg copy of the disk.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

My daughter and I read ask the books together and watched all the movies together and finally were able to watch Deathly Hallows after all these years.

3807000,4,B001UV4XIS,"I had recently re-read the Harry Potter series and I was curious to see how well the movie reflected the end of the books. It seems to me that the movie was quite close to the book. It was also remarkable to realize that the actors who played the three main friends had grown up into young adults during the course of the films. The special effects are complex, though often too dark to see everything, and the mood of the story is reflected in the darker, subdued colors. The remarkable book gets a vivid re-creation in the film.",1465084800,,530,4.363636363636363

3807635,3,B001UV4XIS,"The way JK Rowling wrote the end of this book and series was so perfect, so well-thought-out and so well-crafted that I can't imagine why the directors/writers wanted to change it. The last face-off between Harry and Voldemort was at dawn in the great hall with everyone watching. The sun was rising. Harry had just pulled off his cloak after throwing up a shield charm to protect Mrs. Weasley after she killed Bellatrix. Then Harry and Voldemort circle each other, talking. Harry makes sure he knows Snape betrayed him. He explains the complicated change of ownership of the Elder Wand, ending by saying that if the wand was paying attention, Harry is its master. Then they cast exactly one curse, and this is the most important part: Voldemort casts Avada Kedavra and Harry's is Expelliarmus, which just disarms his opponent. He was chastised early in the book for using it; it's an almost childish move -- the first thing taught in dueling lessons years ago. After all that has happened defeats Voldemort by having a few words with him and disarming him. Voldemort's curse backfires because his wand can't kill its master and he ends up killing himself; Harry doesn't even have to do it, nor does he ever have to utter the killing curse. I thought it a rather fitting and brilliant way to end things, but all of that was distorted and unclear in the movie ending. Other parts were embellished for effect. My final beef is, one of the most meaningful parts of the book is the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry, and, again, much as it was at the end of Order of the Phoenix movie, the conversation they have (this time in King's Cross station) is abbreviated or embellished or twisted around, and much of the heart and magic of it therefore excoriated. I didn't like it. You didn't even give us the scene in which he interacts with Dumbledore's portrait in the headmaster's office.

That said, the beginning of the book was great and the Gringott's scene was great; so much of it was really well done. But when an author writes something terribly perfect, why screw with it in the movie? I suppose JK Rowling trusted you on this, but perhaps that's only because she didn't realize how perfect her ending was.",1454803200,25,2217,4.699228791773779

I was very upset and disappointed with Amazon for not making this very explicitly clear when you are making this purchase. I believe there ought to be a warning box that pops up alerting the consumer that they will not be able to enjoy their purchase at their own leisure, and that they will instead only be able to view something they PURCHASED when they have access to good internet. What a rip off, and a huge waste of $10.00. Very disappointed, and I will certainly never purchase any video content from Amazon again.",1451779200,,873,4.428571428571429

It is a long movie and we rented it on a school night with the plan of watching it across two evenings, but within the 24 hour rental period. When we came back the second night to continue watching, 23 hours after we started viewing the film the evening before, the rental had already expired. Not the first time this has happened. Also, I have noticed the opposite occasionally happens - the rented movie is available for more than the stated rental period.
Why does amazon not include a time stamp on emailed rental confirmations? How they time the rental period is not transparent enough, or maybe their system is glitch prone.

3808682,5,B001UV4XIS,A perfect conclusion to a first class series. Both the books and the movies were top draw. The series is a complete fantasy and should be viewed that way for full enjoyment. Just .remember how to step back into reality when you are done.,1440288000,,237,4.409090909090909

3808684,5,B001UV4XIS,"This is the final movie in the eight part Harry Potter movie series and wow, was it a fantastic movie! The last seven years have been an emotional roller coaster ride for Harry and friends and this movie ties everything in and shows the epic battle of good versus evil. Even though I had previously read the book, my heart was still pounding because of the amazing special effects and the question of how the director was going to portray this book as a movie. I love the Harry Potter series and was sad to see it end but it was nice to see a little clip of how Harry and his friends are several years later. The Harry Potter series is my favorite out of all of the movies that are series and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone!",1440115200,5,741,4.225352112676056

3808749,5,B001UV4XIS,"I love Harry Potter so I highly recommend buying this since it comes with the DVD, Blu-Ray, a ""digital copy"" through VUDU or UVVU, and an extra special features disk. Some people in other reviews have complained about it not really having a digital copy and about having to make an account to get the copy, but VUDU and UVVU accounts are completely free to create. I have a VUDU account and add my movies on there whenever I get codes with my combo packs. Then I can stream the movies from my account online and I don't have to fool with carrying the movies around with me! The special features disk is great and worth watching if you are someone at all interested in behind-the-scenes footage.",1439769600,,694,4.47244094488189

I'm sad that there were only 7 books and 8 movies and that it's over. I have seen this one at least 35-40 times. That ought to tell you how great I think it is. It wraps everything up, with a few surprises. The very last scene takes place 19 years later. I highly recommend this movie. If you have never seen any of the Harry Potter movies, here's an idea: You ought to rent them in order and get some good junk food and drink and have yourself a Potter marathon! A great weekend activity! Or, if you do not have a lot of time, you could stretch it out over 2 weekends.",1439510400,,703,4.0285714285714285

3808868,5,B001UV4XIS,Harry Potter is one of my all time favorite series.  It is suspenseful and extremely well presented.  This particular book being the last in the series was very well done.  Need more.,1438646400,,183,4.65625
3808869,5,B001UV4XIS,The fighting stayed true to the book in some ways and embellished for the sake of cinematography in others but overall this film stayed true to the book and was well made. The final scene with Snape was as much of a tear-jerker in the movie as it was when I first read the scene on paper so I applaud the filmmakers that. Snape's vindication was always a high point of the series in my personal opinion.,1438560000,,403,4.246753246753247

3809282,5,B001UV4XIS,"It goes without question that the books are better, but these movies have been about the closest thing to perfection that a movie has been to a book, I've seen very few movies that ever live up to the book, let alone can keep it going for so many films. I too had issues with how they portrayed harry's battle scene with voldy, but as a hole and after stepping back and taking a deep breath, I totally enjoyed the movies. The only other thing they could have done was make the movie 4 hours long. That would have made me happy by of course that was not something they can do. I adore the casting, everyone plays their roles exquisitely. Daniel is brilliant as Harry.",1433635200,4,666,4.2936507936507935

3809340,5,B001UV4XIS,"When they decided to break Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two movies, I was a sure it was a ploy to make more money from the films before the end.  And I would say that part 1 proved me right since, like the first part of the book, it was a little slow and meandering.  I just got back from seeing Harry Potter & Deathly Hallows Part 2, however, and I am now convinced it was the smart thing to do.  Only three words accurately describe this film.  A.  Maze.  Ing.

I have not read the book since it came out and have not rewatched the last movie, so I was a little concerned that I would forget where we were in the story.  And while a ""Previously in Harry Potter"" would have been nice, I didn't feel I needed it.

The opening shots of this film are the closing shots of the last - Lord Voldemort (Ralph Viennes) retrieving the Elder Wand.  But we quickly flash back to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as they continue their crest to find the remaining Horcruxes so that Voldemort can be defeated once and for all.  But there are still some surprises along the way.  Will they succeed?  Who will survive the coming battle?

For those of you who, like me, missed the Hogwarts gang since they didn't little more than cameo in the first part, you'll be thrilled to know they play a much greater role here.  In fact, once again much of the movie takes place there.  But it's not the old familiar place.  This is the climax of an epic battle between good and evil, so the school becomes a battle field.  It is epic and expansive.  I felt like many battle scenes from the book were cut, but the outcomes were the same.

Really, not having read the book recently, I can't comment on just how true things were to the book although I've heard that once again there were changes.  I will say that the big events I remembered happened here.  And yes, the epilogue was the same as well.  I liked it, so I was okay with that.

There's been some back and forth over the years about the acting or over acting of the cast.  Personally, I have always thought they were fine, and this movie did nothing to change my mind.

Likewise, the special effects were wonderful.  I've always bought all the magic we've seen on screen, and that was the case here again.

It's rare that I am pulled into a movie for over two hours without thinking about anything else.  That was the case here.  I didn't want it to end.  I laughed, I tears up, and I cheered, sometimes all in the same scene.

My only real complaint is the very climax.  As my friend who hasn't read the book said, it felt anti-climatic in many ways.  Still, it was a fleeting thought that crossed my mind; ultimately, I was satisfied.

Harry Potter & Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the epic climax to the epic saga.  I can't imagine a better film version, and I'm ready to sit down and watch it again.",1432339200,,2909,4.302583025830258

I don't agree with the choices the director made in terms of what to keep/what to leave out.  And Daniel Radcliffe's acting just gets worse and worse, he has about 3 facial expressions in the whole movie. I guess you can't know if a child actor will turn out to be a good one as an adult!  The rest of the cast rocks it, especially Hermione and Snape.  It's worth watching, but keep your expectations low.",1430697600,,520,4.319587628865979

3809753,3,B001UV4XIS,"I've seen all the Harry Potter movies at least 3 times each, I have kids.  I didn't read the books, so I'm not referring to the contents of the book, just what I saw in the movies.  I enjoyed the escape into fantasy, the battle of good vs evil dichotomy was amusing.  There is something peculiar about the Harry Potter story, though.  That is, him being reluctantly or accidentally a powerful wizard.  He doesn't really exemplify a bookish wizard that's Hermione's thing, Ron is his porky pig side kick.  The movies communicate the same Hollywood message, don't really study, don't really try, after all only a few odd ones do that, just go with your feelings and play nice.  At the end, I imaging Harry thinking to himself on the bridge, while he holds the wand, ""Dubledoore figured out how to use the Elder Wand without going mad with power.  Oh, but that is too hard and everyone else around me will think I'm not nice, that I'm presumptuous, or secretly coveting power.""  So in the end Harry has contempt for what he has been doing for the past several years, destroys the wand and hugs it out with his friend, then it segues to a weird ending scene with everyone in awkward adult makeup.",1426982400,,1192,4.506976744186047

3811131,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potters and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 picks up in the same spot which it left in Part 1.  Here Dobby is laid to rest on the English coast.  The movie then picks up and moves to conclusion.  There are the twists and turns with Voldemort's wand vs. Harry Potter's wand.  The protagonists move to Hogwarts and the final battle begins.

Needless to say most of the remaining Horcruxes are located at Hogwarts.  This seems to be a flaw on the part of Voldemort.  He should have made his Horcruxes with far more mundane objects, like river rocks and put them in a non-descript place-such as a river bed filled with rocks.  Perhaps there is some reason for this in the magical world that isn't explained in the movies.

Harry Potter is a bit of a Christ-like character here.  He ""dies"" and meets Professor Dumbledore at an otherworldly afterlife-like King's Cross Station.  Dumbledore gives Potter some good advice and one can hear the scared, lonely girl that JK Rowling must have been at one point.  Words themselves are magic...they can do both good and harm.

As the battle concludes the loose ends are all tied up.  This movie is quite frank in that in all battles even the good often perish.  I though the most touching was Ron Weasley's curse against Fenrir Greyback after he killed Lavender.  The emotion here is quite realistic.  In the book, this scene is different and Lavender survives, but the movie's take on this is quite emotional and raw.  I couldn't help but think of my high school crushes and loves and I realize, I'm still friends with all those girls even though whatever relationship we had perished in the fires of youth.

On the whole this is an excellent ending to the movie series.",1418083200,,1708,4.614617940199335

3811480,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fine and fitting conclusion to the decade long run of very successful Harry Potter films.  The series ends on a satisfying note with all the Eyes dotted and the Tees crossed.  And the film finishes out the run with good style, fine acting and just the right level of special effects.
 Our three protagonists are back of course.  We have followed the trio from youngest youth to, in the last film, young maturity.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have matured as actors even as their characters have grown up.  Daniel Radcliffe in particular brings us a strong, self assured Harry in this last film.  The tentative groping of the younger lad are quite gone.  Potter is a full man now if a young one and Radcliffe shows that to us.
 The youngsters have little to fear about being typed by the film industry.  The least well off of the three has a worth well into the tens of millions.  They should all be fine even if they never work again.
 Other notable returning actors include Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson.  Putting well tried actors in even small roles really adds depth to the entire movie going experience.  And with this franchise there is no need to cut costs by putting interchangeable rookies into the small roles.
 Producer David Heyman returns along with director David Yates, who directed three other Potter films, and writer Steve Kloves.  Kloves wrote four of the previous Potter scripts.  Having a comfortable relationship, well worked, among all of the creative talents surely added to the pleasing overall result.
 The gentle hand of director Yates can be seen in the way he handled the Battle of Hogwarts.  He focused on the heroes negotiating their way through the violent chaos of the battle.  The emphasis always stayed focused on the intrepid trio, never on the fireballs, lighting, giants, immense spiders, anacondas and other spectacular events and beings in the fight.  Just right, say I.  The people are more important than the explosions.
 This last of the Potter films is rated a mild PG-13 for violence and somewhat scary stuff that might cause the younger set to fret.  It is good value for ticket money at two hours and ten minutes long.  This ultimate Potter movie rates a very high four saw blades.
 I don't have to be Karnack the Magnificent to predict that this will be a huge success.  It has taken in a quarter Billion dollars at the ticket office so far, worldwide.
 A sign of a worthy film might well be that the audience is at once weeping and smiling as the credits go up.  I was.",1414713600,,2620,4.671772428884026

3812334,3,B001UV4XIS,The movie was ok but they left out way too much stuff and made changes to the story line that I didn't really understand the reasons behind the changes. They dragged some scenes out that they could have cut down in order to add in some of the stuff they left out from the book. I also felt that the epilogue at the end would have been better if they played it out true to the book. It wouldn't have been too long or added that much time to the movie.,1406764800,,450,3.956043956043956

Only, like the Part 1 of the final installment, the characters are really flat and we just can't really form any emotional attachment to them whatsoever, and halfway through the movie, we are bored, and at the end, couldn't be care-less about it.  It doesn't really help, like the novel, it does have one of the worse ending of any epic stories.  I say, it's really the worst of the series.",1406505600,,498,4.32258064516129

We have seen the boy become a man in a great character role from start to finish. On the surface this movie is about a group of ""kids"" fighting the bad. Dig deeper and you will find the characters fighting to overcome fears, standing up for what is right regardless of friend or foe, and identifying what is illusion versus real.

If you take away the movie set, it is a heightened metaphor for life's opportunities and perspectives. It gives the viewer a feeling that anything can be accomplished regardless the odds against them or the situation.",1405728000,,662,4.610169491525424

When I grow up, I want to be an author, and you went through so many publishers! Never give up! Imagine the effort into this amazing mind blowing movie! And how about the tears for Snape? The beautiful story pieces together by this heartwarming life story of Snape. And the sentence, ""But what if I'm in Slytherin?"" ""Albus, you are named after two men, one of them was in Slytherin, and he was the bravest man I ever knew."" I wipe tears away from my red eyes.

The music in these movies were awesome and I have the MP3's that I listen to more often than I probably should. The castings were spot on and at the end of this one all the feels are there. It was sad and awesome at the same time. At the end of this one I still wanted more movie, but I thought they we all to short.

3812786,4,B001UV4XIS,"Spoilers!

I was looking forward to the Battle of Hogwarts but this movie did a poor adaptation. I wanted to see a huge battle just like in the book. And the final confrontation with Voldemort was pretty cool but I wanted it to be in front of the all the students. Also, everyone is so quiet and depressed after he's killed. You'd think everyone would be celebrating and rejoicing.",1399766400,,381,4.521739130434782

3812788,1,B001UV4XIS,"I didn't like this one, didn't like the others (with the exception of the first, and Best!)
Ruined so much of what I loved about the Real Story.  Too many problems.  As usual, lots of fireworks, but a Total Lack of the little touching and Highly Significant moments of the characters and their development for the sake of *snap,snap keeping it moving and getting to another explosion...
The Single Most Hated Moment that RUINED the whole series as I see it (it was that Vitally Culmanative!!) was to Rob Neville of his Moment of Glory...  the single Most Crucial Point of the Whole Narrative, in many ways...  and NOT something Difficult to have included...  Instead, we give him a few dumb jokes, and relegate the Biggest scene to a moment in passing...  story of his life...
Read The BOOKS!!  (or Jim Dale's Audiobook - the Best Version Ever Possible Apparently!!)
Skip this crap.  I didn't see the films in the theatres, or buy any of the stuff, but I still kick myself for paying for this farse exactly because I think those who screwed up one of the best narratives of our time don't even deserve That Much Money.
I don't blame the cast, but the writers and producers should be slapped.",1399161600,3,1191,4.584905660377358

I watched Part 2 first.  We have watched the cast since the first film
and watched them grow up and their characters do so too.  I wanted
to see more at the end of the last chapter, but it was a good run.
The final battle between Harry and Voldemort brought back memories
of reading the last book and seeing the Deathly Hollows on film was
great.  Must watch!",1397347200,,426,4.158536585365853

3812993,5,B001UV4XIS,"I have listened to every Harry Potter audiobook (Stephen Fry is much better than Jim Dale - and if you disagree then consider that the movie character voices take after the performance of Fry) and watched every Harry Potter movie. As I look back at the movies, I would say that this was the best of the bunch.

For those considering streaming via Amazon, the movie was not available locally for rental so I chose to stream from Amazon -  it worked flawlessly.",1395878400,,459,4.518072289156627

3813042,5,B001UV4XIS,"LOVE the Harry Potter series. Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.

A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a ""young adult/kid"" series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told. Or watch the first movie. You'll be so angry you never received a letter from Hogwarts on your 11th birthday,  JUST LIKE THE REST OF US!",1394668800,10,1389,4.464566929133858

3813044,5,B001UV4XIS,After I stopped watching this for like the fifth time I thought back to all the greatest moments in this movie series and or book series. I have been asking for another film and or book for the longest time but I know that it will never come into the nearest bookstore or Amazon. I just hope that one day a series can come even close to as good as these movies I was basically in tears by the time that Fred Lupin and Tonks died. But once Voldermort was dead and it went 19 years in the future I just break down completely every time. I just hope that one day someone can make a fan fiction or even get the right from Rowling herself to do a whole different series about their children. But who would be the bad guy you say? Probably Peter Pettigrew himself because no one knows what happened to him. Was he sent to Azkaban did he escape and if so is he planning his revenge on Potter and his friends by going after their children? Perhaps we'll find out.,1394582400,,955,4.139784946236559

3813280,5,B001UV4XIS,It's not like they could ever come close to the detail that the book did as it would take up a whole decade of 2 hour flicks. I think they did a great job summarizing it and it was thoroughly entertaining.,1389571200,,205,4.024390243902439

It is flimsy and did not have the standard sticker on the top of the box as most new DVD's have. Also, the sleeve for the case is not the real sleeve. It's a fine replica, but the logos on the spine are noticeably different from other sleeves in the series I have purchased. The DVD itself also seems to have a false sticker on it. Just black with the HP logo and the typical WB copyright info around the exterior.

Why is this so? I purchased a new DVD. Not a slightly high class burned DVD. This looks like a graphic designer took to selling copies as income.",1389225600,,653,4.141732283464567

I would have rated five stars if that was done more like how Rowling described the scene in the book. Also, the death of a particular character (again, no spoiler) was rather graphic, and I don't know if I would allow younger children to watch it. The movie is dark, but the HP series gets darker as Harry ages, so that is to be expected, but the movie is done tastefully.",1389139200,,481,4.4772727272727275

Oddly, I liked Ron in this one and didn't like him in Half Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows 1, though I loved him in the book.  This movie redeems him, especially when they battle for Hogwarts.
Spoiler alert, details follow . . . . Cried when Snape died the first time I saw it, sobbed when the casualties of the battle were shown, even though I knew how it would be.  Such a moving and dynamic film.",1388620800,,506,4.361702127659575

I think this is buy far the best movie in the series, although I've enjoyed them all.  And read all the books.  The pensive scene near the end of Deathy Hallows 2 explains a great deal in a very short time.  Even so, Harry goes to face his destiny knowing that he could very well die.  It occurred to me a little while after watching the movie that it embodies all the myths and legends that are woven in the histories of many cultures -- good overcoming evil by sacrificing one's life and being rewarded with resurrection:  Osiris, Christ, and others. It is, therefore, a tale for the ages.",1388448000,,761,4.392857142857143

Would I get it again? Yup, as a gift (and bring the popcorn!). Problems? None. What I liked? Strong storyline, steadily escalating drama, great F/X and no holding back at the end.

My advice to families with younger children? Begin with the first film, then slowly work to the final film. Be prepared to talk, talk, talk about what they saw and answer all questions.

Its as if the director made a purposeful attempt to insist that the viewer had to read the book to know whats going on, yet at the same time spit in their face for having done so. Characters that didn't exist in the book giving lines that characters that were in the book gave, whats worse the character in the book on screen at the time. For example that random werewolf guy, speaking as Fenrir while Fenrir was standing there. Plus the whole Dumbledore/Grindlewold back story was absolutely critical to the story, yet was left out?

3813818,2,B001UV4XIS,"I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution.

Sadly, I feel the final Harry Potter film falls victim to the exact same missteps that have plagued the series throughout its production. Sure, there are a number of things that this film does very well. The special effects are absolutely through the roof, the atmosphere and camerawork are suitably dark and ominous, and there a few very emotionally potent scenes, such as Snape's death and the discovery that Harry makes about his past soon after. Yet the core elements necessary for the foundation of the film are simply lacking, almost absent in certain cases. The interplay between the characters, all of whom we are supposed to be emotionally invested in and cheering for, seems oddly muted. There is a distinct lack of emotional interplay between characters at times when these emotions seem like they should be at their greatest. The moment where Ron and Hermione realize that Harry has decided to sacrifice himself to Voldemort feels extremely underplayed. They barely even try to stop him and seem extremely ready and willing to make peace with the fact that their best friend of 7 years has decided he must die. Also, when Harry magically resurrects himself from the dead (still trying to figure that one out.. the way it is presented in the film is quite confusing), he doesn't receive the reception that you would assume he would. His companions respond almost as if they expected him to come back to life all long.

However, I feel the biggest and most damning issue with the film is the pacing and storytelling technique, especially in the latter portion after Harry is killed. The movie seems to speed hastily through the moments that require the most attention and should be the most emotionally resonant, while dwelling on and extending other scenes beyond their welcome. This absolutely kills the narrative drive of the movie, pulling you out of the action and lessening the scale and the potential emotional impact of the proceedings. The scene after Harry dies and where he meets Dumbledore is obviously a pivotal scene, but the length that it extends through coupled with its positioning squarely at the climax of the movie detracts from the flow and suspense. On the other hand, the scene that this entire decade's worth of movies has been building to where Harry and Voldemort finally clash is treated in an almost business-like fashion. The fight itself feels a bit hasty, but the real problem is that there is no emotional resolution after Voldemort is finally killed. None of the characters even mention or react to what has transpired. This is an absolutely unforgivable misstep because it undermines the entire event, as well as the 7 previous movies that have led to it. There is no emotional culmination and/or resolution with any of the characters after the evil they have been fighting for so long has finally been vanquished. Instead, we are led straight to the epilogue in less than 10 minutes with hardly a line of dialogue from anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Hermione, none of whom have anything to discuss except for details concerning the Elder Wand. The sense of accomplishment, gratification, resolution, or relief seems entirely absent.

At the end of the day though, this is not a horrible movie. It certainly has a number of entertaining scenes and, like the films that came before it, is mostly entertaining and relatively solid. However, it falls victim to the same narrative-driven problems that the other films suffer from and, in this case, the missteps are particularly unforgivable given that this film is the final installment and the one where emotional resonance and correct pacing is the most vital. For that reason, although it is probably one of the better films in the series, I can't give it more than 2 stars. Admittedly, it feels a tad low, but the flaws are simply too significant to be overlooked and they fatally wound what could've been a satisfying conclusion to a relatively solid franchise.",1382918400,,4563,4.946544980443286

3813841,4,B001UV4XIS,"Having never read the books and only inhabiting the world created by the movies themselves I can tell you this came down to an ending that seemed too trite and unmagical for the likes of the Harry Potter I saw grow up on that screen!  Oh the effects are there (tho the 3D is strictly gimmick in these last two films and adds nothing to the overall pop of the story) and the special effects achievements throughout the series are breathtaking in their scope and execution but the story relies too heavily on having read the books.  No offense to Miss Rowling who I'm sure is a superb story teller for her books to have reached the level of worldwide acceptance that they did but the movies seemed a bit formulaic (what with Harry Potter going to Hogwarts from an untenable home each year and fretting over the mystery of the week and vacillating til his confrontation with Voldemort where he found himself rescued by Dumbledore).  My kudos on the change in atmosphere from kiddie fantasy to young adult angst in the last three movies but still when all was said and done and Lord Voldemort lay crumbling in the dust I felt let down somehow and then the scene for 19 years later comes along feeling tacked on and less than successfully visually staged (despite all the tremendous special effects achievement that came before) with Harry, Ron and Hermione looking far far less than 19 years older coming to what is meant to be a full circle having made Hogwarts safe for their own progeny.  To me the magic was deflated and they were mere Muggles again seeing their offspring off.  The books would probably have made all this seem like Grand Opera to me I'm sure as I am vehemently attacked by Potter fans whenever I express my opinion verbally but remember I am judging the films only and in particular the Grand Finale offered by this movie.  Future film historians will dissect the Potter series far more meticulously than I and I will be interested in their views on the subject as well.

3813940,3,B001UV4XIS,"I bought this to complete our collection of the movie series.  As any fan will tell you, the first three movies were pretty good, but they went downhill compared to the books after that.  What a shame they actually divided the seventh book into two movies. . .and STILL messed it up!  Why change Neville's excellent challenge of Voldemort for the wimpy drivel offered in the movie?  And why cut the excellent duel/verbal exchange between Harry and Tom Riddle for the bizarre wrestling match they put in?  If you've enjoyed the movies at all, do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOKS!  They're amazing!",1380672000,,599,4.711538461538462

3813942,4,B001UV4XIS,"This final movie in the Harry Potter series is the darkest of all.  It is the necessary and faithful conclusion to the wonderful writings of J.K. Rowling.  There is little for me to criticize here except for one thing:  something about the ending felt somehow very disengaged and somewhat unsatisfying.  I am not quite smart enough to put my finger on exactly what that missing thing was, but I felt it.  The ending seemed almost trite and devoid of the energy of the rest of the movies.  I know it was authentic to the way that books ended, but as a movie, it seemed to need something else to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion.  Yes, I know, it all concluded the way that the book did and the outcomes were the same.  It was just the manner in which things were presented ON FILM that left me somewhat let down.  Still, given that as my only criticism, the final movie in this franchise, was yet another piece of amazing film-making.  Again, the actors were all superb.  The set pieces were absolutely done with love and care and authenticity and lavish devotion to the Rowling books.

I've mentioned in a previous review of Part 1 that the 3D version of Hallows was way too dark to be enjoyable and that the 2D version was much better.  The same holds true for Part 2 as well.  For some reason, both 3D versions that I purchased from Amazon were way too dark and were not nearly as enjoyable of their 2D Blueray versions.  I have not taken a star away from the movie for this reason, however, but rather for the somewhat disappointing way which the final film was concluded; it just didn't seem quite right.  And yet I am at a loss to suggest a better way to handle the ending.

I highly recommend The Deathly Hallows Part 2 and it is, in the end, a superb finish to a superb movie franchise.",1380412800,,1800,4.357357357357357

He never read the books and doesn't even give the movies a chance.  However, he knows the whole story because my mom, sister, and I are in love with the series.  So, I started watching this movie right after I got it.  He was in the room at the time and he ended up staying for the entire movie because it was that good.

I highly recommend this one to fans of fantasy and Harry Potter.",1379635200,,324,3.878787878787879
3813998,5,B001UV4XIS,"I thought this final movie was one of the best of the series. All the actors have been playing their roles for a while and everyone is fairly comfortable in their characters, the book wraps it all up nicely and this final movie is fairly true to J.K. Rowling's book. And perhaps because the movie producers split the last book into two movies it is easier to pull in additional details that you might not have seen if they'd tried to capture the last book inj one movie. The actors who have grown up in their roles do a great job in this last movie. I watched the series on a TV marathon that showed all the movies except the last one, so I had to rent this on on Amazon and watch it to finish the tale.",1379635200,,703,4.101449275362318

It was brilliant-I think my favorite part was Harry reviewing Snapes memories.  To see Snape as he was instead of how he presented himself and to hear his own death sentence but still carry on underscored the courage Harry has shown all along.

Never fails to predictably wreck a good viewing experience. Not just once, but every Amazon movie I've watched. Get better at it folks.

3814526,5,B001UV4XIS,"There was a boy... A very strange enchanted boy....And for ten years, the world watched Daniel Radcliffe inhabit the role of J.K. Rowling's formidable young literary hero, taking him from a sweet, wide-eyed waif, just beginning to learn about his past and find his unique place in a world previously unknown to him for most of his life to a complex young man with increasing skill and courage, as well as a very noble character as he comes closer and closer to his final ""High Noon"" moment with the Dark Lord(Ralph Fiennes), who has unsuccessfully tried to kill him since he was a year old.
 The final film begins where the penultimate one left off... With Voldemort(whose name means ""Fly of Death"") re-activating the Elder Wand, and Harry, Ron(Rupert Grint) and Hermione(Emma Watson, whose attractive heart-shaped visage is in dramatic contrast to the plump bisque-doll face  she had in the first film) grieve the loss of Dobby(Toby Jones), while inside the Weasley Family beach house, used as a safehouse by remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, Bill and Fleur Weasley(Domhall Gleeson and Clemence Poesy) tend to wandseller, Mr. Ollivander(John Hurt), the goblin, Griphook(Warwick Davis), and Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch).
 In speaking with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn why Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) with whom Hermione and Griphook had especially brutal encounters at Malfoy Manor, thought the Sword of Griffyndor should be in her vault at Gringott's Bank(where Griphook worked), and learn of the possibility of finding another horcrux there.
 Having acquired a strand of Bellatrix's hair, Hermione uses it in polyjuice potion to disguise herself as Voldemort's female counterpart  before she, Ron(who will also be incognito), Harry and Griphook disapparate to Gringott's to search for the items. Harry and Griphook travel beneath Harry's invisibility cloak, and Ron blasts an elixir to with the favor of a goblin banker to help reach their destination. They bypass a sleeping dragon , which guards the vault, but the geminal curse, in which everything they touch multiplies, results  in an overabundance of silver cups just like the desired horcrux appearing, nearly burying them. In a scene vindicating Hagrid's(Robbie Coltrane) warning about goblins being clever but unfriendly during Harry's first year at Hogwarts, Griphook pulls a double cross as the guards close in on them  with wands blazing, leading Hermione to come up with a daring escape plan via the dragon guarding the vaults, demolishing the front area of the bank and incinerating some of the bankers who were unable to flee. Unlike the book, Griphook's fate is better defined in the film as the sword of Griffyndor, his desired reward for helping the three teens get into the vault, disappears from his grasp.
 At the risk of being seen by Muggles, the three fly away from London on the back of the newly released dragon, dropping into a lake as the wyvern flies away. During their submersion, Harry's scar burns and he has telltale seizures and visions. As they climb ashore, he tells Ron and Hermione that Voldemort knows their whereabouts and is scared and angry, and that he has also seen  the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly MacDonald), and surmised that the next horcrux may be found at Hogwarts, and that it has something to do with Ravenclaw Tower. Ron reminds him that Snape(Alan Rickman) in now Headmaster and they'll have to find an alternate entrance into the school. Harry reminds Hermione of how their plans always go awry when she recommends taking time to strategize slowly.
 Disapparating from a green area to the snowy village of Hogsmeade, they narrowly escape snatchers as Alberforth Dumbledore(Ciaran Hinds), who had sent Dobby to rescue them from Malfoy Manor, gives them refuge in the tavern he tends and advises them against an exercise in futility in hunting for more horcruxes. Harry disagrees with Alberforth, and his show of determination leads Alberforth to speak to his dead sister, Arianna's(Hebe Beardshall)portrait. The schoolgirl walks mysteriously into the background, and then returns with someone, who, as the door behind the portrait opens, is revealed to be Neville(Matthew Lewis), who escorts them through a new secret passage into the castle, explaining why it is not featured on the Marauder's Map, how Hogwarts was fairing with Snape as Headmaster, as well as the influence of the sadistic Amycus and Alecto Carrow(Ralph Ineson and Suzanne Toase), the brother and sister in charge of discipline. The course formerly known as Defense Against the Dark Arts is now known as simply the Dark Arts, and the Carrows bruised Neville for refusing to practice the Cruciatus Curse (which incapacitated his own parents)on First Year Students.
  Harry is greeted with applause by his friends and roommates when they enter the chamber where the boats are kept. He announces their search for an unknown object. When he mentions its possible association with Ravenclaw House, Luna mentions that it may be Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. In a moment where she literally takes Harry's breath away, Ginny( Bonnie Wright)appears, seeing Harry for the first time in six months, and warns him that Snape knows of his whereabouts.
 The staff and entire student body are made to dress in full uniform, and march to the Great Hall to be admonished by Snape about hiding information about Harry's whereabouts, demanding those in the know to reveal whatever information they may have and threatening severe penalties for failure to divulge such information. Harry, dressed in a student's robe over casual clothes steps from the ranks to reveal himself and angrily confront Snape about his audacity in taking Dumbledore's place and demanding that he reveal himself as Dumbledore's murderer. Both draw wands. McGonagall(Maggie Smith) takes her place by Harry's side as the Carrows back Snape. McGonagall takes out the Carrows as Snape disapparates through the stained glass window. Students cheer what is only a temporary victory as a celebratory McGonagall lights up the cauldron lanterns.
  All too soon, Harry falters  as Voldemort's satanic hissing, demanding Hogwarts will be left untouched if Harry surrenders himself, and that those who turn Harry over to him will be rewarded. Slytherin student Pansy Parkington (Scarlet Byrne) demands that someone grab Harry, who in turn, is defended by his friends.
  Upon Filch's (David Bradley) arrival, McGonagall demands he escort the counterproductive Slytherins to the dungeons, giving the other students one more reason to applaud before everyone must prepare for war.
 McGonagall  beckons the relief statues into animation to guard the campus boundaries as Flitwick (Warwick Davis), Slughorn( Jim Broadbent), and Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) send a defensive shield into the night sky, in an episode  highly reminiscent of the Battle of Britain.
 As Voldemort and followers wait on a distant hillside, Luna successfully urges Harry to confer with Helena Ravenclaw's ghost to find the next horcrux. The Order of the Phoenix members position themselves around the castle as Ron and Hermione destroy the cup from the vault at Gringott's  in the Chamber of Secrets. In the process, the romance of the young and often bickering couple is permanently sealed.
 Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) confronts Harry in the Room of Requirement, along with two cohorts as he locates the diadem. Draco demands the return of his wand, wrested by Harry at Malfoy Manor as Harry wonders why he didn't confirm his identity to Bellatrix. Draco explains that his mother's borrowed wand doesn't quite understand him, revealing that in many ways he is torn between the will of his parents and his own conscience, making him the story's most pitiable character. Goyle(Josh Herdman) urges Draco to kill Harry, But Ron and Hermione intervene. A battle ensues and Harry has to retrieve the diadem from a mound of brick-a-brack , from which Cornish pixies fly out. He retrieves it as the notoriously hysterical Ron grabs Hermione as Goyle accidentally ignites the room. In the end the diadem is destroyed but only two of Harry's detractors are saved.
 Another seizure and vision  reveal the impact of their actions on Voldemort as well as the last remaining horcrux.
Seamus Finnegan (Devon Murray) and Neville help rig one of the bridges to the school with explosives, and the latter risks his life to bring about the desired result of this action.
 As the battle heats up, giants and death eaters descend upon the castle. Large spiders attack the courtyard, and Alberforth creates a shield when the dementors arrive, allowing the three main combatants to hurry to the astronomy tower to scout out Voldemort and the last horcrux.
 Through hazy stainglass windows, the trio witness the unforeseen results of Snape's chat with the Dark Lord. As Voldemort and Nagini disappear, the mortally wounded Snape urges Harry to take his tears to the pensieve, making a final and curious utterance about Harry having his mother's eyes....
 The Dark Lord gives Harry an ultimatum to turn himself over to him. But the three young combatants go to the Great Hall where they inspect the casualties, many of whom Harry held dear, including two who leave behind an infant son in a tragedy that parallels Harry's.
 Trekking over to the pensieve, Harry declassifies what Snape wanted him to know. With his views of the dour headmaster forever altered by profound revelations, he sits for a while, overwhelmed, but certain of the course of action he must take.
 Soon he rises, and as he exits Hogwarts for what may be the last time, he comforts a sorrowing Ron and Hermione, pleading with them to destroy the last horcrux.
 At the entrance to the forest, Harry has his Gethsemene moment. His golden snitch opens to reveal a Resurrection stone, enabling him to see and speak with a few of his beloved departed, drawing strength from their words before he goes on.
 As the Dark Lord and Death Eaters wait, with the captured Hagrid tied to a tree, Harry calmly approaches....
 While all seems at its darkest at this point, and those who fought to protect Harry fear all will end in heartbreak, viewers will see how Rowling's work will end with life-affirming triumph.
 We will watch a young boy(Arthur Bowen) whose initials interestingly enough, form the word, ""ASP"", follow in the footsteps of his forbears, joining his older brother (William Dunn), and cousin(Helena Barlow) on a rare and unusual journey, with a sister( Daphne De Bestingui) and another cousin (Ryan Turner )waiting in the wings.
 And so the saga ends, and yet begins anew. Assuming she is still at her post as Headmistress, we wish McGonagall well in dealing with  another generation of the Potter-Granger-Weasley combination, and know, that with them around, life at Hogwarts will never be dull.",1375920000,,10879,5.125988700564972

3815096,5,B001UV4XIS,"Back when I was much younger, I read a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I remember thinking to myself on the surface, it did not look like much. But after reading it I came to have a new found fondness, and extreme like to that particular book. Similarly, in 2001 a movie adaptation was made. And I came to love and admire not only the books in the terrific series, but I came to enjoy the movies just as well. Here it is: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

So He who must not be named has taken hold of the elder wand, and for a mere moment, it appears that the bad guys have won. There is tragedy, pain, and unspeakable evil in this story; but there is also in the end, a beautiful and glorious triumph.
The story in the movie is just as great as the novel is, so there is really no need to go any further.

I will say that very few movies and movie series have made me care about the characters onscreen and in real life. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson brought what was just a children's fantasy novel and made it into one of the best series ever period. When someone says Daniel Radcliffe, the first thing you think of is Harry Potter. When someone says Rupert Grint you immediately think Ron Weasley. And when someone says Emma Watson, You remember the highly intelligent Hermione Granger. The acting in all 8 movies was good but Part 2 is where the acting from everyone is real as it gets. The actors/actresses in these movies are passionate and you feel it all the way throughout.

I am sad to see the series end, but at least we know that Harry James Potter will not be forgotten(both onscreen and in book).

All this said, there will not be another series or be it franchise quite like Harry Potter. The magic, the emotion, the fantasy, all of it. Amazing, and just plain brilliant.

Even for non-fans like me who have been following this saga will be delighted at the conclusion to this tale, with great special effects, good direction, good acting and a great script.

There is nothing to hate here, any flaws could simply be nitpicks to an otherwise tight storyline in a reasonably consistent mythology. I've not read the books, don't consider myself a fan, so you may refer to a true fan for verification as to the plot consistencies in the movie in relation to the books.

3815164,5,B001UV4XIS,"I was all for being against the Harry Potter stuff.  Totally.  But we had grandkids reading these books and I decided that it was time to see what all the hullabaloo was about.

What an eye-opener!

A very typical, normal boy with problems and adventures.  Add a girl and a friend and have the makings of wonderful stuff.

Yes, this movie had to cut lots out of the books.  Read the books first, then do the movies.  And be cautious of introducing such material, as wonderful as it really is, do not expose too young, too immature, too sensitive a child too early.  Risky.

And talk about it, discuss values and cause and effect.

While JoAnn Rawling may be too smart for herself, and her writing is sometimes just plain mundane (repeated use of ""tears leaking from his eyes,""  but SHE IS A MASTERFUL STORY TELLER WITH FINE VALUES WHICH SHE IMPARTS.  You have to give her a chance.

It will not change your values; it will authenticate them.

This movie is not a standalone movie. If you do happen to rent this without having seen the others this movie will be confused the entire time.

With that being said this movie is a great way to end the series. It's a heartfelt movie that surround major themes of friendship and love. Expect a few tears shed. This movie has tons of magic (literally and figuratively).",1370044800,,512,4.505376344086022

3815524,4,B001UV4XIS,"Thought, it seemed to vary a little from the book, I thought it was a very well done movie.  Worth the price I spent, and especially watching the first and second one together.  Makes the story line flow that much better.

I am a big fan of action in movies, and this second part really put the action into play.  The events unfolding, the running and the showdowns that came.  It made it all worth while to sit down and watch this one.

The whole series was a good read, and was enjoyable to watch.",1369699200,,499,4.2

3815636,5,B001UV4XIS,"An enjoyable end to the wonderful series of films. Close enough to the book that I did not feel let down by the occasional story adjustment. Perhaps the need to cram in so many events means that the characters seem a little wooden in that they are almost props for the action but, for me, that seems to be inline with the original stories !
 For folks not familiar with either the books or the earlier movies this is not the place to start !
 For 'muggles' it is hard to imagine anything better :-)",1369612800,,498,4.231578947368421

3815645,3,B001UV4XIS,"The finale in the Harry Potter series of films is about on par with its predecessors. Our familiar fiends and friends clash in their ultimate showdown and do so in thrilling fashion. But I am not a reader of the books, so I can't make a comparison.

On another note, we rented the HD version and initially streamed it from Amazon Instant Video app on Xbox 360. It will be a long time before I attend that method again; the resolution was comparable to VHS at best. AND we regularly pull 30 Mbps from our ISP. It was disappointing; however, downloading it to our TiVO did give us the true HD resolution we were expecting.",1369267200,,620,4.391304347826087

3815699,3,B001UV4XIS,"The last installment of Harry Potter cycle is entertaining (and better by far than part 1), but more could have done to humanize the main characters.  The fast-forward at the end of the movie was particularly rapid and understated.",1369094400,,231,4.923076923076923
3815700,5,B001UV4XIS,"More strong performances for the entire cast. Don't know how suitable this is for younger kids. Mine grew up with the series and were older when it started getting darker. I would think younger kids would find this one particularly scary. Of course, the end was badly done and sappy but many, many reviewers have commented on that.

My suggestion... don't read or re-read the final book (or any of the books) before watching one of the movies. I liked almost all of them better on subsequent viewings than on the first when I was comparing them to the books.",1369008000,,558,4.58

In this final installment of the Harry Potter movies, I was almost not disappointed - until the final battle between Harry and Voldemort and the resolution of the Death Stick wand. Why the filmmakers had to change an ending that was so superbly written I'll never understand - but they did it well, despite all. The power and beauty and triumph of the finale are all there, and as praiseworthy as any movie I've seen; I just wish it had been the story J.K. Rowling wrote!",1368576000,,560,4.554455445544554

Obviously everyone already knows that the Granger kid gets knock off in this one, but what a way to go!  Not only is her death one of the best death scenes of all time, but it is highly regarded as one of the best film scenes ever shot period.  Once the young Miss Granger is in the shower we see Harry Potter approach the bathroom. The shower curtain is ripped open. Hermione screams as Harry, who is yielding a knife stabs her to death, violins, cellos, and violas screeching in the background. As one most well known scenes in cinema history, the shower scene has spawned all sorts of myths and legends. The facts are that they used 77 different camera angles during the 3 minutes and 50 second scene. The combination of close up shots with short durations is a technique explained as, ""transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience."" And transfer the menace they did. The Hermione scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 still stands as a bone-chilling example of the ultimate death scene.  To our hero, Harry Potter, job well done!

JK Rowling showed us that the little lessons of life,perserverence, love and acceptance of others will endure. It is not easy to lead and you might lose some cherished things on the way but if you keep true to your heart you will endure.

3815917,3,B001UV4XIS,"A big disappointment. The last movie did not live up to what I had expected and I left the theater wondering why did JK Rowling allow crucial elements of the book completely left out and such a shallow adaptation. Why would they change the escape on the back of the dragon from Harry's idea to Hermione's? Huh? Then the added scene of Voldy and Harry flying around together, huh? Even the eloquent speech Neville Longbottom that Harry lives in all of them did not overcome the dreadful adaptation. The shocking revelation about Ariana's history which was a key to all of the books other than a part of Voldy living inside of Harry was never mentioned. The only plus to the Blu-ray are the additional special feature discs. Beginning with POA each of the movies fell flat on their faces. I stood in line with a bunch of other folks for the midnight shows and left puzzled as to the one-dimensional adaptations. Only the first two movies were movies to be reckoned with and worth the time and ticket prices. Maybe 20 years or 30 years from now the books will be shown as a TV series with a faithful transfer from book to screen instead of such botched up versions. Oh, the soundtrack is excellent though.",1367193600,,1202,4.543778801843318

Hallows two comes with two such disks and all of them are thoroughly entertaining revealing ""secrets"" of making the films, hearing what the stars have to say about their roles and getting to see many of them without makeup.  I highly recommend purchasing both disks and then, get a nice cold drink, take the day off, put your feet up and enjoy spendning many exhilerating hours being entertained.",1366761600,,613,4.932038834951456

3815975,4,B001UV4XIS,"It all ended for millions of Harry Potter fans, many dressed in their witchcraft and wizardry outfits, with laughs and tears as J.K. Rowling's life work, that spanned over second novels, eight motion pictures, a theme-park ""land"", countless other licensing merchandise, and 14 years (more than half of most of those that are reading this's lives), epically concluded.  This review will remain as spoiler free as possible however if you have not seen at the very least Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 do not read this or see the movie beforehand.  Part 2 wastes no time in starting the story and one would be utterly lost throughout the entire film.
Again the movie picks up just minutes after Part 1 ended with Voldemort (brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes) grave robbing the great Professor Dumbledore's grave for one of the ""deathly hallows,"" the omnipotent ""elder wand.""  From there two hours and ten minutes are filled with the heroes Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his red-headed sidekick Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Harry's other best friend, Ron's love interest and all around know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Order of the Phoenix seeking the destruction of Voldemort's evil ways and defending Hogwarts castle in a showdown for the ages.
The real show stealer is Potter MVP Alan Rickman who plays Severus Snape, Harry's long time professor fiend now turned Hogwarts headmaster.  For those that have not read the book again spoilers will be spared but there is an earth shattering revelation about three quarters through the film that showcases Rickman's ability to nail the character of Snape.  If there is ever a reboot of the Potter series, Rickman will be one of the irreplaceable few.  A character that was long despised both in novel and film turns the table on the audience and Rickman gets it every time.
While the details will be left spoiler free there is much to be said about the final battle at Hogwarts castle.  Many of the fan favorites, like Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) return for the latter half of the film.  For longtime Potter-fans  this adds to the ""realism"" of the events to come as wizards and witches start to die.  A large problem that the book had (and perhaps it is the lack of visual cues) is the ""realism"" of what happens.  Reading that women and children died and seeing it on screen are two entirely different events.  Throughout the final scenes there are bodies of students who had fallen in battle strewn throughout the halls of Hogwarts.
The final battle between Harry and Voldemort was a tad anticlimactic but then again so too was it that way in the book.  Credit is given to the film makers for the visual representation of spell casting.  Where sword fights are easily depicted through the back and forth blows the opponents dish out, spell casting was never that way in the book.  Here the film improvises like they always have.  This is especially good in the Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) battle.
Here is a good time to mention that the differences between the book and the movie are not factored into the review score.  Of course some changes were for the better and some for the worst but it will be left to the audience to decide that for themselves.  This review is on the film alone.
It should be mentioned that the film was not just a studio grab for cash in the decision to break the final episode into two.  After seeing the film it is almost impossible for the two films to have been one three hour experience.
The special effects are always great in these films as no expense is spared.  For review it was viewed in an IMAX 3D experience.  Where the 3D was not necessarily an addition to the film, the IMAX definitely was.  Some of the wider battle scenes where there is a lot of nuanced action are better viewed in this fashion and the sound is much more clear and crisp.  Thus IMAX is recommended.
Just like the special effects, no expense is spared on the audio effects or soundtrack.  The Harry Potter theme that John Williams wrote for the first film does not make a real appearance until halfway through the film but the utilization of previous themes towards the end is brilliantly executed in the way it brings the nostalgia of a 14 year journey to the audience.
While the movie was good by Potter standards (not even the best film of the franchise) it fails in a number of categories that Potter fans will surely backlash.  Much of its shortcomings arise from the failures of previous films that this one has built on.  It spends too much time on secondary and tertiary characters that haven't been referenced in some time and has an anticlimactic ending.  Another downfall lies in the film's skimming over new characters.
There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will break box office records but there is much doubt on its road to the Oscars.  It is a good film that everybody who wants to see it probably already has and those that haven't should make sure to read or view the past material before admission.",1366588800,,5144,4.71731843575419
3815976,5,B001UV4XIS,"It was hard to wait for this one but the final battle was worth seeing. In the final part of the first half, Voldemort finally attained the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. In this part, the search for the Horcruxes led to breaking into the almost impregnable Gringott's Bank with the help of the Goblin Griphook in exchange for the Sword of Griffindor, but Griphook betrays the group, leaving them inside the vault after taking the Sword. They manage to break out by freeing a dragon guardian. Their next move leads them back to Hogwarts where another is hidden. In their return, Severus Snape, the new headmaster faces and loses a challenge to Professor McGonnagal and is driven from the castle. In the meantime, Voldemort chooses to attack the castle and while those that can fight prepare for the battle, Harry talks to the Grey Lady to find the next horcrux. He discovers it in the junk room of the Room of Requirement, but he is not alone. Draco Malfoy and his two cronies, Crabbe and Goyle try to stop him and demand the return of Draco's wand. Hermione and Ron appear and a battle ensues and Crabbe sets the room magically afire, dying when the fire he cast goes out of control. Draco and Goyle are trapped,and Harry and Ron manages to save them both as they flee from the room on brooms. Ron stabs the found horcrux and kicked it back into the room before the doors shut trapping the fire inside. As they head to the Shrieking Shack, the overhear a conversation between Voldemort and Snape about the Elder Wand's lackluster performance. Snape tries to assure Voldemort the wand will serve only him,but Voldemort disagrees thinking that because Snape killed Dumbledore, the wand served him. Harry watches as Voldemort orders Nagini to kill Snape before he leaves to lead the attack on the school. When Harry emerges, Snape gives him his memories before he dies and it is through these memories that Snape shares with Harry snatches of his mother's life and his true destiny, which is to die alone at Voldemort's hand. Will he? It's a great ending to a wonderful series.",1366502400,,2079,4.683060109289618

3816170,5,B001UV4XIS,"Part 2 was incredible! This is where the whole story comes together.  This is where many unanswered questions are finally answered.  It is also rather traumatic, because you lose many of your well-loved characters.  JK did the appropriate Shakespearean thing and killed off nearly all her characters.

Voldemort has the elder wand.  Harry Potter is still hunting Hocruxes, but he doesn't realize just how big of a sacrifice he will have to make in order to destroy Voldemort.  Also plaguing him are doubts about Dumbledore as he learns he may not have known the man as well as he thought he did.  This is where we learn the true loyalties of Severus Snape, and we see a better side of the Malfoy family.

Voldemort was rather pathetic, and I didn't know how I felt about that.  In a way, it was nice because it showed how bullies are often what they are because they are frightened people.  Yet, you don't always like your villains being pathetic.  The ending where you see the future is one of my favorites--and it makes up for the trauma of losing nearly everybody you liked.  It gives you the feeling that life did go on.",1365206400,4,1124,4.565

A little disappointing due to reading the books prior to the movies - to be expected in the interest of movie length, I guess.

3816283,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 is an epic and emotional conclusion to my favorite movie series. I love the contrast between the light hearted adventures of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to the extreme emotional intensity of this movie. Each movie has gotten progressively darker and this was an emotional finale. Once we reach the part in Snape's memories where we see Lily telling Harry how loved he was and to ""be safe,be strong."" just before her death,we have a whole series of scenes that touch the heart and soul with their sadness and/or poignantness : Dumbledore explaining how Harry must die. Lupin Talking about the son he'll never know,Lily saying they would ""always"" stay close to Harry,Harry sacrificing himself,and Neville's speech declaring loyalty to Harry even in his ""death"". I'm not very sensitive in general,but Harry Potter really brought some raw emotion out of me. I cried during most of those scenes listed above when I saw this movie for the 1st time and I can still have strong reactions to them. The greatest triumph of Harry Potter is how much the series is highly successful in making it's readers/viewers care about it's characters. Then there's Snape himself. The way Snape's memories were brought to life is awesome and fantastically well done. The acting,especially of Daniel,Alan,and Ralph is exceptional. One major change from the book is far better in the movie than in the book. That change involves the fate of the Elder Wand. In the book,Harry tells the portrait of Dumbledore that he will return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. Harry tells Dumbledore If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won't it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That'll be the end of it."" However,because the Elder Wand was truly won by defeat,and not necessarily by murder,this was no guarnteee the Elder Wand would never be won from him. By destroying the Elder Wand,as Harry does in the movie he ENSURES it's power will be broken. The movie's way of handling that was far better than the book's. And i really enjoyed the epilogue. Seeing Harry see his son off to Hogwarts was heartwarming. And I LOVED how the classic music from the 1st 2 Harry potter movies as the Hogwarts Express pulls out. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was a richly rewarding conclusion to the Harry Potter series and is a lock for 5 stars. :)",1363046400,,2405,4.825665859564165

The movie is very enjoyable and brings the series to a satisfactory close - even the forgettable (and oft wished forgotten) epilogue.  The cast is superb and the ""kids"" show that they have developed some acting chops since the first chapter.  Shame to have lost Albus, but his brother's presence is incorporated well into the plot.

Picking up where Deathly Hallows Part 1 left off, this film put me into the final half of the story. And when we find Hogwarts, it has fallen into Voldemort's evil hands with Professor Snape as the new headmaster. And we find Harry and company still hunting Horcruxes at Shell Cottage and Gringotts in Diagon Alley. And after an escape ride on a dragon, they return to Hogwarts for the ultimate climatic showdown. And from that moment on to the very end, it's the Hogwarts residents vs. Dementors, Acromantula, giants and Death Eaters.

And the final battle at the very end of the movie was exactly how I wanted it to be. Voldemort vs. Harry through Hogwarts (the Great Hall in the book) with them flying on the outside. And when they clashed wands for the final time (first time on Goblet of Fire), I wanted it to go out with a bang!! And my wish was granted.

Through the dramatic deaths, the incredible action sequences, and the mayhem this movie gives the Harry Potter franchise at the end it deserves.

It is a good adaptation of the book and like most adaptations it would have been done better in some area's.  The movie though does explain a few details better than the book did and that was the author's intent when she reviewed the script that had been written.  In the end however I still think more could have been done.  The part of Harry's death reeks of religious belief and is done in the movie much like the 'Passion of the Christ' to give Harry the 'Chirst' appeal by the death and rebirth.  Even though I don't think it was needed.  It gets old that more and more movies are putting this into their plots and story lines.  Well, in 15 years they'll do a 'remake' of it as they did with 'Total Recall' and others.  Maybe it will be better.",1361232000,,843,4.318471337579618

This is a magnificent piece of cinema - Academy Award caliber - and I will be surprised if it does not garner multiple awards recognition. No other film this year (2011) has been so universally acclaimed by the professional critics. If this is truly the end, it is a bittersweet moment. Watching Harry and his two closest friends and the actors who play them grow and mature has been almost like watching my children come of age. In this final episode,Harry, Hermione, and Ron continue their search for the Horcruxes upon which Voldemort depends for life. All of us knew from the author, J. K. Rowling, that one of the protagonists would die in this final episode...but if you haven't read the book and you haven't seen this film, I won't spoil it for you...the ending may very well surprise you. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their finest performances in this final film; and they are supported by a perfectly cast ensemble, most of whom we've seen before...but there are a couple of new faces - Ciaran Hinds, as Dumbledore's brother, Alberforth; and Kelly McDonald as the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw.

The film is dark, brooding, and introspective.  Just the thing for a kids afternoon entertainment.  More of an adult adventure, but the kids who started out with The Sorcerer's Stone are now of the age where they can watch a film of this nature without nightmare.  A fitting end to a billion dollar franchise that started young people reading.",1359504000,,617,4.614678899082569

3816592,5,B001UV4XIS,"Anyone who has read the ""Harry Potter"" books by J.K. Rowling knows that the movies haven't quite held to the books, though some have been better than others at this.  This one, the final chapter of the movies is, I'm afraid, guilty as charged.  I refuse to be a spoiler, though by now everyone knows how it ends, and tell you exactly how.  First of all, any of you who have both read the books and seen the movies, knows perfectly well how much it differs.  Still, for those who have only seen the movies, it's a good ending inasmuch as Tom Riddle gets his!  He gets it in the book, too, but I liked the book version a tad better.  Too, Harry does not break the Elder Wand but rather uses it to repair his own.  Still, it's a good ending to a great series of both books and movies, and it certainly is a ""must-have"" for any Harry Potter fan.",1359072000,,841,4.154320987654321

3816625,4,B001UV4XIS,"Certainly the darkest episode of the series. Dumbledore's exit circumstances never made sense, to me, anyway. There was little to segue into Jenny and Harry being married. There was also gaps in character development for Ron, Hermione and Malfoy. But the author has hadmitted having difficulty with teen and post teen relationships.
Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, the inimitable Ms. Bonham were all superb.
That having been said, the lack of preparedness on the part of the school was out of character. There was plenty of action in the fight scenes. Enough to satisfy anyone. The ""horcrux"" element did not make sense and the Elder (wood) wand was not really ever a part of the movie.
The producers of the movie made the same mistake Ms. Rowling did by trying to stuff 100 lbs. of action into a 75lb. package. A transitional book or a transitional movie might have helped. (And I'm a fan.) So, having gotten all the negatives out of the way, I say just sit back and enjoy the fun. It's fantasy, so have a good time. I did.",1358553600,,1020,4.640883977900552

3816745,5,B001UV4XIS,"Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand in 3-D.

I just finished watching HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART II, and I'm very impressed with the entire saga. I saw three of the first four movies last month via XFinity On Demand & one on television, and the final four films Monday, Tuesday and today (I saw the fifth film on Monday, the sixth film on Tuesday and the II part conclusion in the morning & afternoon today). As I was watching the first movie, I could see why Ms. Rowling chose to go the way she did as per the romantic relationships in the books. I was even more impressed when I saw how much a close friend of mine resembles Ginny in the movies. It made me think about her a lot. There's a scene late in the sixth film that I really like, because it reminded me that she is that way with me as well. In the films, Ginny is never mad at Harry, and the scene in the sixth movie is which reminds me of it just so moving I nearly cried.

Of course, the books provide more information, and much of it was omitted from the scripts. A loss, though the decision to excise key points of plot & exposition was made for time constraints. I'm glad that the scene in the fifth book where Harry smashes Dumbledore's office in a fit of rage did not make it into the script, as I really hate that scene.

I recommend the films. Great acting, good storylines and wonderful scores.

Rated PG & PG-13 (intense sequences of action violence, frightening images and brief mild language).",1357776000,,1497,4.279151943462898

3816877,1,B001UV4XIS,"I am not a Harry Potter fan.  I sincerely do not understand the attraction.  The books are poorly written and the films dark and clunky and the characters and actors playing them annoying, at least for my tastes.  And I will never know why American kids like this British drivel.  But I digress.

Nevertheless, I watched Part I and II or the long-winded finale with my adult son and daugther, since they are fans, and after spending 4+ hours doing so, I came away even more astounded that the Harry Potter chronicles became a popular rave. The plot is terribly contrived and unoriginal.  So the evil wizard killed Harry's parents (for some reason) and now Harry gets his revenge and saves the world (at least I think that was the plot).  And if anyone was expecting a poignant ending, looking elsewhere.  The ending was uncreative and unemotional.  Just like the entire series.

I have posted elsewhere on my visceral dislilke of Potter and JK Rowlings inability as a writer.  Why HP became so popular will forever be a mystery to me, like black holes.  And that's what it felt watching this movie, falling into a literary and dramatic black hole.",1356393600,,1147,4.68

3816917,5,B001UV4XIS,"I'm one of those late arrivals to the Harry Potter world.  I never read any of J.K.Rowling books about the boy who lived.  I didn't know anything about the wizarding world, or witches, or where Hogwarts was.  I saw the first three films in the theaters, but skipped the rest.  Now?  Now, I love everything about the movies.  A few months ago when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 was released on DVD; I started a Harry Potter marathon from the beginning.  I watched them all in order.  Since then, I've watched all the DVDs, four times.  That's 28 viewings of Harry Potter films all leading up to this.  The epic conclusion to the most successful (critical and commercial) series in cinema history.  Let me begin.

What I liked about the movie:
The Story

If this isn't obvious, I don't know what is.  An orphan wizard, magic spells, and an unknown connection to an evil wizard named Volemort.  The movie is easy to follow as a lot of the set up was done in earlier movies.  This is a balls to the wall action epic.  The final battle between Harry and the wizards against Voldemort and his army.  You really must see the previous films to fully appreciate the conclusions in this film.  The one thing that is important above all else... above all the explosions and magic and spells is simple... friendship.  The story of three best friends and their journey to this epic conclusion is unmatched by any other film I've ever seen.  THAT'S ultimately why these movies are so satisfying to so many people.  I don't want to say too much more, if you were looking for a plot summary, this review is not the place.

Characters / Actors

As with any great story, there must be great characters. And for 10+ years, the world enjoyed these characters.  Rowling has given the world so much.  And what this film has been able to do is showcase them all.

I believe the supporting cast must be recognized.  The marvelous Ralph Fiennes as the evil Lord Voldemort.  Alan Rickman as the mysterious Snape.  Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange.  Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton as Lucious and Draco Malfoy.  Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom.  And the lovely Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall.  There are many more.  Maybe they weren't showcased for long periods of time, but every hero, every villain and every wizard in between is included in the story.

Then there are the three main characters, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) who really shine.  Their character development is key to the success of the film.  They each go through a transition and grow as a character.  It's amazing to think the producers have been able to keep all the same actors in tact for this epic series of films.  The best scenes in the movie involve the three best friends.  Like I've been saying all week... Harry, Ron and Hermione... I'll miss you.

The Score

The theme to Harry Potter was written back when the first film was released, by none other than John Williams.  The same brilliant man that brought us the scores to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman and so many more.  Alexandre Desplat scored HP and TDH Part 1, so it is fitting that he has returned to score the finale.  The score is beautiful.  I actually purchased it yesterday and I am listening to it as I type this review.

The emotional weight of the score is vital to the story (you're going to read a lot about the emotional weight of the film in this review).  The music alone tells the story.  I was chatting with a friend about the film and told her I could discuss the score alone for hours.  And I really could.  The score was so impressive in relaying the emotion as well has elevating the action.  It was was enough to put me on the edge of my seat, literally.  And never forgetting the original theme created by Williams, it is weaved into this film as well.  Bravo Mr. Desplat.

The Editing / Pacing / Tone

This is something that doesn't get a lot of recognition in Hollywood, but it is so important to a movie like this.  If the editing and pacing is off, the entire movie crumbles.  You know by now there is a lot of emotion and also action in the movie.  How do you work those two together?  The editing is key.  Mark Day did an amazing job of keeping the film nice and neat.  There is no deviating from the plan.  For the most part, the film is told in chronological order, and there was a lot to cover.  The tone was perfect as well.  And I believe it is the marriage of cinematography, editing and score that sets the tone.  Great all around!

The Director

Really, what the score, editing, pacing and tone all come down to is the work of David Yates.  Yates has directed the last four Harry Potter films in the series.  And there is a reason for that.  He understood the material, he understood the world.  The producers of the films understood Yates is a fantastic director.  His work on this film proves you could have a huge Summer blockbuster, and still carry the emotional weight of a drama.  It was perfectly balanced and Yates is the man to thank.

What I didn't like about the movie:
Length
Ironically, this is the shortest film in series.  If only that wasn't the case.  I understood Warner Brothers' motivation for splitting the two films in half.  But in retrospect, I wouldn't have split the movies where Yates did.  I would have included some of Part 1 in Part 2.  Just my opinion.  Maybe it's because I didn't want it to be over I was enjoying it so much!

The Verdict:
Amazing, what all Summer movies should be

We've come to expect explosions and special effects in our Summer movies.  But what we are missing in most of those films is the emotional weight to make us care.  I know I keep repeating myself, but this movie made us care.  We felt invested in these characters and the final outcome of their stories.  This all goes back to Rowling and her writing.  Without her imagination, none of this comes true.  Brilliant, simply brilliant.

While watching some of the special features, the producers refer to the films as a series, NOT a franchise. This is true; the movies are a series spanning 8 films to tell an overall story. It's not a franchise of unrelated events.  So to see the 8th and final film combine so much was amazing.  There are aspects and remnants of all the prior movies in this film.

It was difficult to say goodbye to all the amazing characters, but the beauty of cinema is this... great stories and great films stay with us, forever.  Whether it's E.T. and Elliot's remarkable friendship, or Harry, Ron and Hermione causing trouble... we're reminded, through film, of what it was like to be a kid again.  I sat next to a little boy at a sold out screening and was mesmerized by his reaction to the film.  He laughed, he cried and he covered his eyes at times.  But he was so engaged in the film, it was an awesome sight.  Movies like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 give me hope for the future of cinema.",1356220800,13,6970,4.475697211155379

Secondly, you CAN now download copies of the movie to practically any device you own in hd and watch it whenever you want.  The complaints seem to be coming mostly from apple users who don't like the fact that apple doesn't support ultraviolet (they can still access it on any apple device through flixster).  Additionally, your ultraviolet account can have up to five people in it, who can share their entire uv library with each other.  Every uv movie you have on vudu is automatically available on flixster, cinema now, and vice versa on all of your computers, phones, smart tv's, xboxes, and playstations.  I have used it for a while and never had any problems with any of these features.  Yes, you may experience buffering when trying to stream hdx movies, but that is more a product of you network setup handling the large file sizes.  I have a wired network and have never had a single instance of buffering since I joined months ago.  You also have the option of switching each movie on the fly to regular or hd or sd to avoid this problem if you have a slow network.  I understand the negative reviews, as it has gotten off to a rough start, but give this format a chance for yourself, and realize that many of these comments are from people who simply want ultraviolet to go away so they can get their itunes codes back on blurays.  The best answer would be for apple to get on board and allow ultraviolet linking so everyone can watch the way they want.  Not likely to happen, but that's as much apple's fault as anyone's.",1355270400,,1756,4.5396825396825395

3817198,5,B001UV4XIS,"Ok, so I may have teared up a couple of times, I admit it.  Yes, at a Harry Potter movie.  But that's ok, I have no shame, it was touching and I think it did justice to the finale of the book series.  If you haven't seen the other movies, don't bother with this review, go watch the first one.  They are meant to be enjoyed in order.

Continuing where the first book left off, Harry and co have buried Dobie and decide to search for the remaining horcruxes.  This involves dangerous forays into Gringotts and also back to Hogwarts itself.  But there are secrets Harry must know, secrets that could effect everything that he knows.  Voldemort's army is growing and becoming more dangerous day by day.  As Harry searches for the remaining Horcruxes within Hogwarts, Voldemort starts battering its defenses for the final showdown.

Characters:
Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter
Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley
Emma Watson: Hermione Granger
Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange
Jim Broadbent: Horace Slughorn
Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid
Warwick Davis: Filius Flitwick
Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemore
Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore
John Hurt: Ollivander
Jason Isaacs: Lucius Malfoy
Gary Oldman: Sirius Black
Alan Rickman: Severus Snape
Maggie Smith: Minerva McGonagall
David Thewlis: Remus Lupin
Julie Walters: Molly Weasley

The characters, as usual, were wonderful.  All the actors are marvelously placed in their roles and never fail to please.  Radcliffe as Potter rarely fails to please and he plays a very believable Harry.  He made me feel like I was reading the books, and that's always a good thing.  What's great about Radcliffe in the role is that not only does he look like what I envision Harry to be, he has a quiet noble way about him that I associate with Harry's personality.  Surprisingly, Ron and Hermione didn't have as large of roles in this movie.  They usually have more of a part and while they were there, it just didn't seem like the usual showing of their characters.  The side characters were also well done and while I would have liked to see more of them, I was content with it how it was.  My only complaint on characters would be Voldemort.  He just didn't seem very menacing in this particular edition.  In fact, he almost seemed a little weak and granted he was enduring Horcruxes being destroyed, but I thought he would be a lot more violent.  The real standout character was Neville, just like in the books he showed a lot of bravery and fortitude in this one with his actions against Voldemort.

The plot follows the book of course although there were some deviations.  But it didn't take away from the enjoyment and if you've only ever watched the movies, it probably wasn't even noticeable.  I still prefer the books (but then again I always do) but the movies are extremely well done.  Not only are they visually stunning with all the special effects, they do carry the plot well.  For the special effects the broom riding is always impressive, but they had a lot of other fight scenes and scenes involving magic that just couldn't be made without the effects. They did some really neat effects involving fire as well. As said before I even teared up at this one which its very rare a movie can make me do that. I just thought that a lot of emotion was portrayed and even though I know its a movie, I felt bad for what the characters were going through. The music too was great and is always very haunting.  Yet, it still fits the movies perfectly and honestly adds to it.

Great finale to the movie series and much better than the first part of the Deathly Hallows.  This is one I'll definitely be buying when it comes out.

3817201,1,B001UV4XIS,"While the movie was great, the Flixster & UltraViolet is just horrible.  While I was able to load it into my Flixster account, when I linked my UltraViolet account, it disappeared.  When I tried to re-add it, I was over my limit.  Tonight I wasted four hours creating accounts for Sony, Universal, UltraViolet, and Flixster.  Lots, and lots, and lots of aggravation.  If am stunned that this product every made it through beta testing.  I wrote Flixster and still am waiting to hear back.  If I don't get anything by the end of the week, I will ditch Flixster and UltraViolet... never to be tried again.

If anyone from Flixster or UltraViolet read this, I would encourage you to look at Amazon or iTunes.  Real easy to use.  To anyone buying this and thinking you are going to watch this on anything but your TV... good luck.",1348185600,,826,4.557823129251701
3817202,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter was fantastic at the theater, wonderful on DVD, and exceptional on Blue-ray.  I have every movie on DVD. I was determined not to switch to blue-ray. After seeing this edition, I am swapping out my DVD collection for a Blue-ray collection.",1348099200,,251,4.837209302325581
3817203,5,B001UV4XIS,"This is a great finish to a superb story.  It pulls it all together nicely, except about Snape, is he Harry's father or just Lily's soulmate? Great movie.",1348012800,,154,4.5

3817205,5,B001UV4XIS,DVD was in as-stated condition. The special features disc did take three cleanings before it worked but the main disc works very well which is what truly matters. Thank you.,1347235200,,173,4.8
3817206,5,B001UV4XIS,"Well first I have to say all of the Harry Potter films are wonderful.  Having said that, probably my least favorite of them would be ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"", with my most favorites being 1. ""Deathly Hallows part 2"", 2. ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"", 3. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and then ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Sorcerers Stone"".  They definitely saved the best for last.  In my opinion, they out did themselves on ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" ... in every way.  The older actors are pretty much all the best of the UK actors.  The children are all grown up and are comparable actors and actresses in their own right.  Radcliffe, Watson and Grint were wonderful and have grown into very talented actors and actresses.  I really can't think of anything else to say about it other than it was fantastic.  I saw it in the theatre and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I own the DVD and I still feel the same way watching the DVD. I did kind of feel that my summer was somewhat incomplete because there was no ""Harry Potter"" film coming out this summer.",1346889600,,1067,4.403061224489796
3817207,5,B001UV4XIS,Very Happy with my purchase of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. Will Purchase from Amazon again!!,1346889600,,113,4.7
3817228,4,B001UV4XIS,"Overall, 'Deathly Hallows pt 2' was still one of the better Harry Potter movies. While I know people thought 'part 1' was bleaker, that actually ranked up there as  my favorite. I like part 1 better than part 2.

First off - there was nothing at all wrong with the cinematography, the music, the costumes, lighting or acting. I rather enjoyed the music a lot - and said so even two minutes in.

All the actors did an excellent job - the ""kids"" on up. Daniel Radcliffe did a great job in his last outing (except for one horribly stiff line that took me back to how bad he was in the first two movies), and as much as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson had to do with last movie, their parts seemed diminished with this one. That is understandable considering the story arc.

It was great seeing that all the Hogwart students were back this time - if you remember last, there was no school in that movie, however, I liked seeing Neville and Seasmus.  But the adult actors did a great job,  and I'm always a big fan of Alan Rickman's Snape, so I can't complain about his performance. You never can - he always hits it out of the ballpark. Ditto with Maggie Smith. Ralph Finnes did an outstanding job.

Don't blink or you'll miss Emma Thompson's four seconds and the guy who played Ron's dad.

The movie was really good, but still lacking.  My opinion of course.

With all the other movies, I heard people complain about what was missing from the books, which is not unusual for any movie adaptation - and usually those gaps didn't affect me or how I thought the movie turned out. This time, it did.

One part was material that was missing. With one sentence - one! - they skipped about 70 pages of the book, all having do do with Dumbledore and his relationship with his family and one Gellert Grindelwald. It was big point in the book about the search for the Deathly Hallows and the grasp for their power. ....and that whole implied gay thing.

Neville also mentions the Carrows and needing to watch out for them, and while I saw their names in the credits, I'd almost dare you to pick out which scene they were in.

There was another part missing for me as well:  the passion. (and there are spoilers if you have not read the book.)

I wasn't looking for gratuitous violence, but all the talk of this being a big battle movie, I did kind of think you'd see the deaths of Fred, Remus and Tonks.  It was all after the fact and barely a blip. Where was the connection to their deaths after having been with Fred for 10 years and the other two for the last few?  A few seconds of film to show Ron's reaction to his brother's death didn't really tie me to that emotion.  I think it was a missed opportunity to put some heart into it all. The director does it (to a degree) with Harry and his parents and Sirius, but they don't really allow it with others.

And I wanted and needed more of an exciting demise of Bellatrix LeStrange. Maybe I read the scene with a different sense than was conveyed in the movie.  Her fight scene with Molly Weasley was way underplayed....and done much better on Julie Walter's part than Helena Bonham Carter's. Still, it seemed like playing with their wands as opposed to vengence on either of their parts. Actually, it must have taken Bonham Carter longer to get into make-up than she was in all of this film.  (Side note:  I did enjoy Hermione's voice coming out of her as she tried to portray Bellatrix early in the movie, but there was a flaw with that when going to Gringotts - I'll let you see if you catch it.)

Going back to Neville, and again, maybe I read it with a different perspective, but the killing of the snake was just 'meh' here. I remember rereading it several times to make sure that Neville, not Harry, was in some ways the actual hero of the day.

The last point was the epilogue. There was a point in the book that described Malfoy at the train station that should have been more poignant. It wasn't.....at least for me. Malfoy was shown for all of 0.04 seconds. The shot conveyed nothing.

For all the hoo-hah about having to reshoot that epilogue, my first thought was - 'wow, how bad was the first version?""  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't tear inducing or anything.",1346803200,,4211,4.359795134443022
3817229,2,B001UV4XIS,But the actual DVD skipped multiple times and some parts of the movie had audio that did that not match the picture. Very bad. Very disappointed. Two stars because I was able to watch the film on digital.,1346803200,,204,4.394736842105263
3817230,5,B001UV4XIS,The cast and crew outdid themselves on this last of the Harry Potters.  For sure the best of all.  We've watched it 6 times so far.,1346630400,,131,4.0
3817231,5,B001UV4XIS,"First and foremost, by their nature, the books are more intense and intriguing than the movies. Having said that, the movies have been made to be as close to the book's storyline as possible.  This last movie in the series is suspenseful, thrilling, and moving. I LOVE IT! A great buy for any Harry Potter fan!",1346630400,,310,4.535714285714286
3817232,5,B001UV4XIS,Great movie and in great condition. Speedy delivery and I was very satisfied. I would highly recommend you to others.,1346371200,,117,4.9
3817233,1,B001UV4XIS,"The movie is terrific. Of course.

I didn't get around to immediately activating my Flixster/UV digital copy, PROBABLY BECAUSE the process was so bug-riddled and ridiculous when I did it with Part 1. It was infuriating and took days and their dubious technical ""help"" to complete, oh, and the process would work ONLY in one of my 3 browsers. Fail.

Tonight I tried to do it with Part 2, and the required code is nowhere to be found in the Blu-Ray box. Yep, I was terribly irresponsible with a piece of paper at some point. And guess what? You can't just BUY a digital copy of this movie. Not here, not from iTunes, not from anywhere I know of. To get the damn movie on my iPad, I would have to buy the entire disc set again. Why in hell can't I simply buy a digital copy??? (Oh, and the region-free disc/digital combos being sold in the UK specify that the digital copy will only work there, not in the US.)

This CRAP cannot die soon enough. Flixster/Ultraviolet has a complete monopoly on certain digital movies, and it ISN'T UP TO THE TASK. Somebody should buy Warner Bros. a clue. I would've grabbed the digital copy right away if I hadn't dreaded the whole process from the previous time. Oh, and while I'm ranting, the MPAA/RIAA wouldn't have such a problem with piracy if they stopped making it so completely impossible for people to USE WHAT THEY LEGALLY OWN.",1345852800,,1367,4.481927710843373
3817234,2,B001UV4XIS,"Ordered this wanting the BluRay/DVD combination, but disc that arrived was BluRay only disc. Apparently the graphic but NOT the description is accurate...",1345766400,,154,5.739130434782608
3817235,1,B001UV4XIS,"This rating is not for the movie, but for the formats and product delivered.

Multiple issues:

1) No DVD format copy... Not as listed on the Amazon site (BluRay / DVD plus UltraViolet)!
2) UltraViolet ""Digital Copy"" (read: false advertising!) and Flixster FAIL, big time (You knew this last winter, why is it not fixed?)!

Positive Note:

1) Still a good movie, just can only watch it on BluRay instead of all of the formats I thought I had bought.
2) Amazon gave me a partial refund for not sending the combo with the DVD format.

Details:

First of all, this package was advertised as a BluRay / DVD combo with the UltraViolet ""Digital Copy"" (more details on that below)... but where is my DVD copy?  I bought the package for the dual format so I could play the movie on my family's older DVD format devices... Amazon has agreed to give me a partial refund, since I opened the package before realizing there was no DVD format in the package.

Now, I would like to claim my Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 2 UltraViolet Digital Copy as some consolation maybe I can watch my movie when I'm traveling, but...

First: I have to install another browser to support Flixster's lack of programming skill to even claim my movie code (Flixster is the method Warner Bros. used at their UltraViolet interface)?!  Since I use Safari, I get a blank page when trying to claim my code when I get to the Ultraviolet link, the FAQ says this is a known issue, workaround: make the consumer install a different browser?!  I guess I have to install Google Chrome on my Mac.

Second: Flixster Collections (their movie download app) is listed as an UNIDENTIFIED developer with Apple... UNACCEPTABLE!  If this is what I should be using on my Mac, make the effort to show that you're legitimate Flixster!  They also recommend Adobe Air to do the downloads... At least Adobe is reliable and trustworthy... so I can install Adobe Air, we'll see if it works though.

Third: The Flixster website is TERRIBLE to find anything useful for help or contact information!  Too many issues with trying to get this to work, and I know I'm not the only Mac user out there.

I even installed Chrome on my iPhone to try and claim the movie there to work around installing another browser on my Mac... nope, have to claim it from a laptop or desktop!  The filxster.com formatting on the mobile device with Google Chrome is awful as well, doesn't even fit to the screen, have to pan around to see things!

So now that I have downloaded Google Chrome AND Adobe Air on my Mac... now I am being asked to download Flixster Desktop App, just to download the movie... Isn't that what the Adobe Air was for!  Why should I have to install all of this junk on my computer to get to see the movie I paid for?!

While I'm waiting to download the movie to my Mac (which is taking an exceedingly long time... over three hours to download), I will try to watch it from my iPad... What if I have internet issues?  Why can't I rewind more than 30 seconds at a time?  Why can't I fast forward or skip with a button?  I can do those things with the slider, give me some buttons. No subtitles, the BluRay disc it came with has them... By the way, the downloaded version is standard definition... Why not Hi Def? I bought the BluRay version didn't I?

By the time I figured out how to get the accounts and various Apps and programs, gave them my personal info, installed them, downloaded the movie, uninstalled the excess junk off my Mac and was ready to play the movie, it was well over four hours after starting this adventure!

Now I have it downloaded to my Mac and I can't play it through iTunes, again, no buttons other than pause, can use the slider, but can't pick chapters or scenes, no subtitles (I wanted to do this all of this on my computer, not a simple mobile App).  With iTunes I had those features, as if it was a disc playing in a player, just on my computer!  ""Digital Copy"" does not mean what it used to mean on packages... false advertising?

Both my phone and my iPad already had the Flixster App as we use it frequently to look up movies in theaters and buy tickets... Great job on that, just the expansion to UltraViolet leaves MUCH to be desired!

I will NOT be purchasing any more Warner Bros.' or any other studios' movies using UltraViolet copy (by the way it is not a ""Digital Copy"" which I used to be able to play in Windows Media Player and iTunes so stop with the false advertising).

I will ONLY purchase digital copies through iTunes now.  Since this movie isn't in my iTunes collection, it probably won't even be worth it to watch, one more system to have to keep up with.... epic FAIL UltraViolet / DECE, Flixster and Warner Bros.!

I have submitted complaints to both UV and Flixster and am waiting to see if they even respond.  I wish I would have read all of the review on UV earlier.  I usually don't read the reviews on movies, because I know what movies I want... now I'll have to check up on the formats too!

Kudos to Amazon for their help, as much as they could.  I think that they shouldn't carry the UV format until DECE gets their platform figured out though.",1345334400,2,5156,4.406546990496304
3817236,2,B001UV4XIS,"It seems the more complicated the story became, the simpler the movie version.  So much of the detail was left out of these movies, they weren't  worth watching.",1345248000,,161,4.714285714285714
3817237,5,B001UV4XIS,"I had only this movie to collect, as I have the all the rest.  I love all the movies, and this one also did not disappoint.
The special effects, the characters are all superb!!.",1344643200,,177,4.205882352941177
3817268,3,B001UV4XIS,"I can't even describe in words how much I was looking forward to this movie. Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bang

Were my high expectations met? Sadly...no. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the case...All of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.

Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark.  I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be. So maybe that's also an unfair assumption on my part.",1344556800,,2026,4.270833333333333
3817269,5,B001UV4XIS,The Potter movies and books are one of my very favorites.  I do watch them repeatedly.  I would recommend them to anyone.,1344470400,,121,4.454545454545454
3817270,3,B001UV4XIS,"It's ok, but not very good, just like the last few films that this director has made of this franchise. The fact that the producers kept him on is telling of their own problems. The whole series needed a better team. The scriptwriter was never any good IMO, and the producer's have to take the blame for that one as well as they kept him on and kept going back to him. The complaint for the series is much the same, too much was left out, and given the slow pace of the films, just try and find a reason why that is? The pace is so slow it seems we are watching ice melt, so you can't say time constraints are to blame.

Oh well, it's ok, just barely. Perhaps if you haven't read the books the films won't seem so bad. Obviously, IMO the 3rd film was the best. Yes, the films got worse as the books got longer, but that is the fault of the production team, writer, director etc IMO. So much was either left out or changed and replaced by scenes that added nothing to the storyline, that one wonders about the English film/tv industry, yet all the actors were wonderful. Well, the kids grew up in the series, so you can't blame them for being more than kids at the time of the early films, which IMO were actually better despite the acting of the kids at times. They learned their craft, yet the story was fiddled with so much by the screenwriter and last director, that it isn't worth watching the films IMO. Go read the books first so you can fully feel the wasted results of this last film. The script is just plain mediocre at best leaving the actors little to do most of the time but pose and parade. It's a sad fact is it not? I wish them well, as I cannot wish well on the producers, writers and directors, no wonder the third one didn't want to come back. Too bad, they really needed him or someone with a little vision or even someone that could just plain condense the book better either on paper or film, but alas, that was not to be.

Imagine being one of the actors and having to go out on the interview circuit to promote the film! You have to have nice things to say which is nearly impossible in this case. Oh well, good thing it's over, maybe now a tv live action version can be made or a anime version, which could be even better, but with the 'Day After Tomorrow' reality coming in the next couple of years, that is not likely to happen.",1343692800,,2355,4.173626373626374
3817271,5,B001UV4XIS,Don't be fooled by the Digital Copy comments. Do not buy the UK version. You will not be able to download the Digital Copy unless you create a UK iTunes account which requires a UK issued credit card. Plus your DVD  disc will not play in a US dvd player (PAL format vs NTSC). My wife trusted the pseudo gurus and bought the UK version. She was not able to download the  digital copy or play the dvd. Only the blue ray disc works in the US.,1343347200,,439,4.0344827586206895
3817272,1,B001UV4XIS,"Ultraviolet and Flixster both suck.  Attempting to create an ultraviolet account and then linking the movie to it, well I've seen buggier programming, I just don't remember when.  With Ultraviolet you can't tell if you've been successful or not.  When you log in, it takes you to your account page.  Now, you have a problem because when you attempt to leave this page, it wants you to update your info including changing your password which you did last time you were stuck on this page. It just stubbornly refuses to let you leave gracefully, but tries to trap you in an endless loop.  Flixster gets to the part about having you log into your ultraviolet account to link the movie and then once you do, it just locks up on an empty box and refuses to let you continue.  And you have to have Flixster to link the movie to ultraviolet.  Terrible, just absolutely terrible!  The only good news is that the movie was fine.",1343174400,,919,4.527272727272727

I love all the Harry Potter movies and decided to download the digital copy of this one.  It took me roughly a million years to download the movie with Flixster and the quality is about the worst possible.  Streaming isn't possible for me due to my slow rural internet connection, but I thought it would be nice to take the time to download the movie to my laptop so I can take it with me when I travel... er, no.  It's going to be deleted... I would rather not watch it at all due to the horrendous visual quality.  Furthermore, even if I was at a location where I could use UltraViolet, I can't access my account right now due to inherent flaws in UltraViolet's tech support.  I'm not sure what the studios were thinking here, but UltraViolet and Flixster are failures in my opinion.  Fortunately for WB, the Harry Potter movies are spectacular and fans will buy them despite all the problems with UltraViolet and Flixster.  Unfortunately for movie fans, people have no choice but to buy movies with these digital ""services"" and WB and other studios will see this as a green light to give us more of the same.  If you are going to buy these movies, do it with the assumption that you are not getting a usable digital copy, because really you won't be getting a usable digital copy.",1342396800,2,1373,4.438247011952191

3817311,5,B001UV4XIS,"First a confession: I used to be a muggle until very recently. I never read the books and I watched ""Harry Potter"" movies for the first time in April and May this year at the express invitation (order) of my daughter. And since the first movie I watched I was immediately captured by the magic of those stories and I saw the last movie in the saga the first day it opened in cinemas.

Considering that the movie is still playing, I will try not to provide spoilers, but let me just say, that this film really ends the whole ""Harry Potter"" saga with great skill, power and brilliance. I am certain that the scenario had to cut some excellent things which were present in the book, but still, the final chapter is a VERY powerful story!

All the main actors perform brilliantly. Daniel Radcliffe has a real talent and in this movie it shows. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are as good - and I see a great future in the movies especially for Ms Watson. Allan Rickman's Professor Snape is simply impressive and Helena Bonham-Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange is as crazy as usual. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort as being even more fiendish than in previous parts - and the Dark Lord also displays personnel management style clearly inspired by Darth Vader... I must say that the delight with which Voldemort screams his ""Avada Kedavra"" curse every time in this movie made me really shiver...

The thing which I liked particularly is that some of the secondary characters rise to their best. It is of course the case for Neville Longbottom, who finds his internal hero and for Luna Lovegood, who is my absolutely favourite character since the first moment she appeared in the story. But the character who suddenly deploys the wings to rise to her real greatness is Professor Minerva McGonagall! This is without any doubt her greatest hour and she reveals herself to be not only a great witch but also a great general!

An excellent idea was to plunge the movie mostly into darkest night and gray shadows. Even when the sun rises, it is obscured not only by thick dark clouds but also by something else, like ashes of a burning world mixed with tears of grief... The atmosphere for this last battle for the future of the world is quite apocalyptic. The battle scenes are very impressive and the siege of Hogwarts seems to be fought as intensely as that of Minas Tirith in ""Lord of the Rings"".

The ending of the movie is very good and closes with necessary dignity this incredible saga. I recommend to everybody to see this film, even if you are not that much into ""Harry Potter"". After seeing this last chapter of the saga I abjured once again and for always my previous muggleness and I will now read the books which my daughter will (I hope) lend me...",1340150400,2,2741,4.574338085539715

3817352,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the last epic conclusion movie in the entire Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling and directed by David Yates. In the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 Harry, Ron and Hermione need to find the Horcruxes that contain lord Voldamort soul and destroy them with a magical object like a Basilisk fang, Harry has only destroyed two Horcruxes, which would be Tom Riddles diary and the locket of Toms also the previous Headmaster Professor Dumbledore destroyed Voldemorts ring that was his mothers. Now Harry, Ron and Hermione must go to Hogwarts School and destroy the final 3 horcruxes that we don't know what they are. In the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 the three wizards along with every good wizard must face off against Voldemorts army, creatures and all while Harry Potter faces off with Voldemort himself. In this epic blockbuster film two sides of good and evil face off at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry while Harry faces off with the leader of the death eaters.

In my own opinion I think the best 5 parts would be the following (from start of the movie to finish)
 Robbing Gringots bank
 Harry's return to Hogwarts
 Voldemorts warning
 (My favorite) Courtyard apocalypse
 Harry's final clash with Voldemort
One part I think could've been better is the courtyard apocalypse because the director should have put part of the scene in first person point of view to let the viewers see what a student saw. The second improvement  scene I thought could be slightly improved is the attention to detail. The final improvement that I know shouldve been in the movie is I would've like to have seen what hogwarts looked like with Voldemort in control such as how the students were treated.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to ""complete the journey.""",1337040000,,1920,4.77643504531722
3817353,5,B001UV4XIS,Oh Harry Potter...what can I say? This was so much better than CATS. I would see it again and again!!!!,1336953600,,103,4.2
3817354,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 lives up to the hype... for the most part.  I really like the action overall.  Even though the film's over 2 hours long, it actually feels much MUCH shorter.  Perhaps because it's so compelling and I was caught up in the characters knowing this would be the last time I'd get to see them.

The action is mainly focused around or inside the castle and all the havic and chaos that follows (which is a lot- especially related to the gang running from face-covered fireballs and the numerous mighty impressive explosions).

Perhaps the only complaint is that the final boss fight isn't as epic as it could have been.  Without spoiling what happens, when Harry is supposedly deceased and someone else takes over the castle and the land, a battle then occurs that's good but not *great*.  It's not great because it lacks a sufficient amount of suspense and should have been stretched 10 minutes longer.  I don't know, after 10 years of the Harry Potter films, I believe it's fair for viewers to demand a more satisfying boss fight.  Still it's definitely good enough.

When Harry enters a spiritual world of mist and haze, this entire segment is totally beautiful and offers great storytelling.  This and that one fireball chasing segment are highlights for me.  The amount of beautiful magic is a satisfying continuation from Deathly Hallows Part 1.

Overall, the VERY end of the movie makes me cry and the rest of the film is really good too.  Recommended (do I even NEED to say ""recommended?""  If you've been following the Harry Potter franchise all these years you're going to watch it anyway!)",1336867200,,1637,4.734982332155477
3817355,4,B001UV4XIS,"LOVE harry potty and i do love the way they did this movie! The whole series is one of the best book to movie sets I have seen, however of all the movies this movie was the only one that left out some things significant enough to really bother me! If you haven't read the books though I see no reason why you won't love this!",1336694400,,325,3.9393939393939394
3817356,5,B001UV4XIS,"A spectacular finale to a spectacular series! If you have not read the books, you have lots of surprises in store. If you have, there are enough differences, and enough surprises in the way events are depicted that I'm sure you will love it anyway. Of course if you have not seen the earlier movies, it's probably a good idea if you do that first, at least Deathly Hallows Part 1.

As the story opens, Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementers, and Snape is now the headmaster. The place has changed enormously, of course. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) realizes that the last horcrux must be at Hogwarts, and returns there to find it. What he finds, of course, is a huge amount of trouble.

Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are with him, of course, and as soon as they manage to sneak into Hogwarts, they find that Dumbledore's Army is ready to fight. Which is good, because Voldemort is amassing a huge army of death eaters just outside the grounds.

It's a magnificent battle, and I won't ruin a thing by telling you any details. Eventually, of course, it comes down to Harry versus Voldemort mano a mano. But first we have the revelations involved in Snape's final tears. Harry collects them and, on Snape's instructions, pours them into the pensieve. What he discovers there is the key to winning the battle against Voldemort.

For the romantically minded, there's an epilogue 19 years later, where we get to see what couples are now sending their children to Hogwarts. I believe one couple mentioned in the book is missing, but perhaps they are in the background where I missed them. I suspect long-time fans can predict who has paired up with whom.",1336694400,,1656,4.680412371134021

3817536,1,B001UV4XIS,"I went for the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy version because my previous experience with digital copies (all via iTunes) just worked.  Dealing with Apple and iTunes is generally a streamlined, professional experience.  To get an ultraviolet digital copy, you have to create two accounts and hope (in my case, vainly) that the web sites you deal with actually work.  And don't expect that the web address that flixter gives you for support with your digital copy actually knows _anything_ about the movie you are dealing with.  Overall, the only way I could assume that the flixter/ultraviolet system is a success is if the (secret) intent is simply to exasperate their customers rather than actually provide the product allegedly sold to the consumer.

The movie itself was good.

It's just the studio's (poor) attempt to keep more control and profit does not seem to be up to scratch.  It makes me think that the studios figured they could keep even more money from the digital movie sales if they skimped on the supporting infrastructure.

I'm thinking the astute consumer will, in the future, exercise patience and wait until the cost of the used blu-ray media drops enough that they can afford to buy the blu-ray, burn the ultraviolet digital copy paper, and buy a copy of the movie from iTunes if they want a digital copy.",1331856000,,1322,4.896860986547085

One of the main characters turned out to be a ""good guy"" and not the bad one everyone thought, just as I hoped. This last chapter included the traditional ""happy ending"" that J.K.

3817571,1,B001UV4XIS,"I have noticed a WHOLE lot of people complaining about Ultraviolet copy. This is a good sign, and hopefully through this some change in WB will come.

But this is not the MAIN complaint of my review. My main complaint is with a horrible scene that sprouted from the film itself. I don't mind TOO much if they skip things because I know that the movies and books are two different things. And I have been delighted at some additions, as it just adds cool stuff about our favorite characters. This is not the case with this film.

I will give spoilers: Minerva orders 200 children ranging from ages 11 to 18 to be locked in a dank dungeon. In this dungeon they will be in the MIDDLE of a deadly attack by Death Eaters, as the entire Hogwarts is being attacked. The reasoning, you might ask? Because ONE of these 222 panicked when Voldemort threatened to kill them all if they didn't turn over Harry Potter. This is a war crime.

If you defend this scene on the basis that they were SLYTHERINS, then I am really worrying about your morals or your mental health. They are children, and Rowling has said herself that the majority are NOT evil.

There is even proof that this is out of character: In the book, Minerva sends everyone to safety. This Aberforth challenged this and says angilly"" We could have captured a few to be used as hostages!"" Harry says: ""Your brother would never do it.""",1330992000,2,1386,4.44488188976378

3817596,5,B001UV4XIS,"This review is a technical review for two Harry Potter movies:  1)'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XHY) and 2) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XIS).

For Deathly Hallows Part 1, the product details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""2.40:1"".  It is not.  According to the Internet Movie Database, the Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1.

On backside of the DVD case for Part 1, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  This is incorrect, thank goodness!

The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an Aspect Ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!  Warner Video's use of the words ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"" is probably their way of saying ""anamorphic"".  They should just say, ""Anamorphic.""

A true Letterboxed DVD of this movie would be a 1.33:1 image with a 2.35:1 widescreen image embedded and centered within it.  The movie would have black bars showing above and below.  It could be viewed on an older 1.33:1 TV without distortion.  It could also be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in 1.33:1 (Pillarboxed) Mode without distortion.  Or is could be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in Zoom Mode without horizontal or vertical distortion.  On a widescreen TV, in Full Mode, the image would be distorted and would appear stretched horizontally.

Again, this DVD is in fact *not* Letterboxed.  If you watch this DVD on a 1.33:1 TV, the image is stretched vertically, hence it is anamorphic (which is good for those of us with widescreen TVs).  On a widescreen 1.77:1 TV, you need to watch the DVD in Full Mode to view the movie without distortion.  (Zoom Mode will not work well since the vertically stretched image will simply become bigger and remain vertically stretched.)

For Deathly Hallows Part 2, the Product Details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""1.77:1"".  It is not!  The Internet Movie Database tells us that the movie is 2.35:1.

On backside of the DVD case for Part 2, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  Again, this is incorrect!

The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!

So, the good news is the DVDs are fine.  Amazon is a bit confused about the correct Aspect Ratios and Warner Video needs to learn the correct definition of 'Letterboxed'.",1330473600,,2622,4.877551020408164
3817597,4,B001UV4XIS,"Just wanted to let people know that if you're thinking of getting the DVD from the UK site, DON'T! I was very close to ordering from there, but when I researched it, it seems you can only watch Blu-Ray from there. The DVDs are NOT region-free. I don't have a Blu-Ray player, so this means something to me.

Having said that, I have to add that I HATE the ""free shipping"" that's offered now. It takes pretty close to two weeks to get anything from Amazon that way, and I've noticed they keep sending my things to a FedEx place on the other side of my state and letting it sit for a few days. Oh, and that's after they wait a few days to ship it out to begin with. It's almost worth it to pay the extra for faster shipping. This is where the one-less star comes in.

I was happy to see that when I bought this DVD that I also got a free one-month rental to watch it on my streaming device, so I did get to watch it before it arrived (it's supposed to be here tomorrow). I plan on giving this one to a friend and keeping the digital copy (if I can get it to work), so that just makes me more anxious to get it....

3817604,4,B001UV4XIS,"Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history.  And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper.  For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.

The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents.  The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.

As directed by David Yates, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2"" has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element  - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion.",1329609600,3,1093,4.666666666666667

3817641,5,B001UV4XIS,"Nothing much can be added to the hundreds of reviews this DVD has already received but here are a few quick comments.

1. Don't be put off by the many one star reviews. Most are complaints (quite legitimate, I'm sure) about the Ultraviolet digital copy. I purchased for the DVD and could not care less about Ultraviolet.

2. The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.

3. Unlike other films in this series this views much like an action movie with long battle sequences. Curiously, the film adopts some action movie motifs like magic wands that seem to emulate machine guns and artillery in their effects. This is also the case in Part 1 also. By and large, though strange, this worked for me. The escape from Gringott's and the battle of Hogwarts are fantastic sequences.

4. Even if you've read the book don't watch this without watching Part 1. Get both parts and watch them in quick succession over a weekend at most.

Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout. This film validates the decision to split the final book into two parts.",1329091200,4,1425,4.572549019607843

Who was it in the Weasley family that Ron was crying so desperately over?  All Weasleys seemed to be accounted for and right there mourning the death of some unknown redheaded person.

3817660,1,B001UV4XIS,"Around the time that games started making more money than films, movies began to look an awful lot like games and the last few Harry Potter films are no exception. Every scene has the same texture, dim lighting, awkward and indecipherable action sequences created by people who have likely spent far too much time indoors to know how things actually look and move.

Not to be outdone, David Yates method directs like a binging Death Eater and drains any remaining signs of life from this once charming series. The main characters all but collapse under the weight of their faux grim and gritty makeovers. Cringe-worthy lines like, ""Not my daughter you b***h!"" pretty much ensure that this film will only be timeless as an object of ridicule, much like an avocado-colored refrigerator is today.",1327968000,2,793,4.917910447761194
3817661,5,B001UV4XIS,"As a fan of the books, I of course found aspects of this film lacking when compared to their source material (the ultimate showdown between Harry and Voldemort, the way Ginny is portrayed, the casting/treatment of Bill, Fred's battle) but after I saw the movie the first time I realized that instead of finding the errors/issues, I should focus on the movie as a separate entity from the books. WHen I did this, I found my love of the film growing.

The arming of Hogwarts is amazing...so is the battle. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman give great performances and the progress Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe have made throughout the films is great. Their characters are believeable and honest and so well portrayed. I even liked the epilouge!

While so many fans found things that disappointed them (and I still think the final battle should have been in the great hall in front of everyone) I think it's important to enjoy these films as their own thing.

As far as extras on the BluRay, the conversation between JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe is amusing and informative. The feature on the women of Harry Potter is interesting but should have been longer. On the second disc you're only getting about 1 1/2 hours of content, which is a little sad. The movie mode (which allows you watch the film while being interrupted by the cast/crew with tidbits from the making of the series) is interesting, though a lot of the information wasn't new. Also some of the deleted scenes were put into the movie in this mode which was interesting but also annoying because they hadn't been finished in terms of special effects.

I know at some point another version of all of these films will be released. And I can only hope for more special feature (or extended versions with completed new scenes added in). ALso I want some commentaries! It would have been so fun to sit listen to the three leads discuss their adventures while making all 8 films.

So watch this and enjoy it for what it is. It's not the book, and it will never be as good as the book. But as a film it is beautiful and moving.",1327881600,,2085,4.564171122994653

This last chapter in the Potter series has the same first-rate production values, and the same lack of pandering to the 10-year-old mind (if that term is not in itself an oxymoron -!-), and I loved-loved-loved it. It touches all the important points of the novel in as much detail as possible given the time limits of film, and it told me the same story as the book in pictures and sound instead of written words.

There is no precedent for this. I can't think of any movie series that has been so long lasting with the same actors, or any other series where we have literally been able to watch the actors grow from children to young adults. It's been ten years now, and because of this, it's nearly impossible to review Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows Pt. II. It's such an exhausting, emotionally satisfying and bittersweet experience for so many people. It's not even really a film anymore. It's the end, the last bit of Potter as it exists now.

Needless to say, I loved the movie. LOVED it. It was never going to capture every detail of the book, but I can't imagine a better capper to this always consistent series. Though largely jettisoning heavy plot for a simple, balls-to-the-wall war/sacrifice story, the movie manages to be the most emotional, gasp-inducing entry yet. Just like the book, this is dark, resonant stuff. I think every Potter fan will be satisfied, and there is no shortage of clap-and-cheer moments... payoffs that only a series of this length can properly produce.

And above all, it's the characters. It's always been the characters, of course, but I can't think of another movie where I've felt more engrossed in the good vs. evil conflict. Sure, I already knew how it was gonna end, but the stakes were HIGH. Crazy high, and shiver-inducing at moments. It's in the expressions of the actors, the filters used in the cinematography and the swell of the music. Fictionalized wars don't mean a whole lot if you don't care about the people fighting. And in DH2, we not only care about the people, but we care about the place, too. Hogwarts has become iconic, as have the hills and valleys surrounding it. To see the castle as a war zone is devastating. To see what happens in the Forbidden Forest later is even more so.

But then there's the ending. It's pretty perfect. Part of me wishes that in a decade or so we'd get a continuation. The rest of me says, don't ruin a good thing.",1327708800,,2064,4.631147540983607

And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter... When I stream things at home from Hulu, Netflix or other sites the quality is great. As the film opened the quality was terrible, pixelated to the point that we could barely see what was happening. We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't! I like Amazon for many things, streaming video is not one of them. My advice - buy movies on DVD from Amazon, stream from Netflix.

The only glorious exception to this rule is the all too brief moments with Severus Snape, played with the wonderful Alan Rickman. In his death scene and the viewing of his memories by Harry, the emotional impact of the book comes through. Fred's death, ten seconds of screen time, if that. Virtually no explantion of Dumbledore and his past, no real explanation of the Hallows themselves (so why have the name in the title?)

He could harm him, but not fatally.
  Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have been hiding from Voldemort and his army in various places, but now Harry realizes he must get inside the Hogwart's Castle without being seen.
  Now with Volemort even closer to finding our hero, Harry, Potter believes he must find Voldemort and kill him first.

  Spoiler: I enjoyed the scenes when Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) was dueling with Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), but it was all too brief. Finally, Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) was given some action scenes of her own.

 Sad to see the end of the Harry Potter movies. I have enjoyed seeing them all in their over 2 hours extended form. When it's a brilliant movie, I don't care how long it is.

In 2010, J.K. Rowling said she still has the characters in her head and could definatly write an 8th, 9th and 10th book. ""I feel I'm done, but you never know. I love writing them.

 On June 23, 2011, Author J.K. Rowling officially announced she will not write another Harry Potter book again, however they have developed the ""Pottermore"" website exploring the entire world of Harry Potter and other characters.

 J.K Rowling has also mentioned if she should write again about Harry Potter and the World of Wizards and Quiddith, he may not be the central character.

 Sigh!

 All eight ""Harry Potter"" movies are now available in one DVD package.

I've only seen the movie once and I went in with so many preconceptions that I will likely have to sit down and watch the movie again to get a real feel for the film and how much I like it. I saw it a while ago, but needed time to think it over a bit before spreading my thoughts before you.
Second part to The Deathly Hallows and conclusion to one of the biggest film franchises in history, Part 2 follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they search out the last Voldemort horcruxes and try to stop an impending attack on Hogwarts.
I certainly found this film refreshing and a lot more enjoyable than the slow and awkward&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-1/dp/B001UV4XI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part 1</a>. While the first film had some enjoyable moments - our heroes breaking into the Ministry of Magic - it didn't add much to the film series. This film on the other hand delivered a great deal of satisfaction to any Harry Potter fan. The story moved along at a very pleasing pace and I was engaged throughout the entire film. There was enough spell-casting and wand fights taking place in this movie to appease any magic-lover. The resolution of each character's story was satisfying and everything led to a gratifying end. The performance of the actors was very good, the special effects were incredible, and I feel the series finished with a powerful bang.
Still, while there was much that was good in the film, there were a few things that needed some more attention. First, I was sad that Nicholas Hooper - composer for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Order-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B000W7GFG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Order of the Phoenix</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Blood-Prince/dp/B000ZELISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half-Blood Prince</a>&nbsp;- was not in charge of the musical score for these last two films. His music for parts 5 and 6 was spot-on and added a great deal of depth and emotion to each film. I felt that his work on this film could have been an excellent contribution to the overall impact of the series end.
Second, while it was a great jolt to see the deaths of some of our favorite characters, I felt the film did not do their deaths enough justice in this movie. The revelation of their deaths was a shock, but the film moved on too quickly for us to get a full blow of knowing these characters are gone. I little more hang time and emotion with each death would have made for a more intense and growing despair and an overall greater triumph in the end.
Overall, the film was very enjoyable and rewarding. Definitely worth the time and money. Thus ends a great franchise.

As far as questionable content:
The film had some pretty violent moments and it certainly earns its PG-13 rating. I would not recommend the film for youngsters as it would be a little too scary.

3817829,4,B001UV4XIS,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two"" was for me a good ending to the film version of the Harry Potter series. I personally found it better to watch both parts together so as to be able to follow the action a little more closely. There was much to like about this film the action scenes were done well, and there was more than enough drama and pathos to keep me interested. I enjoyed seeing Neville Longbottom getting to be a heroic figure, I hope we will see more of this actor along with the rest of the young cast get to do more films and shows they are all excellent. My only quibble is that Voldimort's death should have been a little more
dramatic. It seemed almost anti-climatic to me. As for the digital copy I have no complaints about it. I also wonder why the spine of the DVD case is different from all the others??",1325980800,,836,4.264150943396227

3817852,5,B001UV4XIS,"I got addicted to the Harry Potter movies pretty early and have bought copies of them all - the first three on DVD the rest on Blu-ray.  The movies are very fun to watch and this is no different.

If you've paid close attention to the earlier movies there are no surprises and yet there was still a feeling of suspense throughout.  The details, the actual scenes, the interaction of the characters, etc. all make for a great movie.  Things, of course, come to their neat conclusions as expected giving a satisfying close to the series.

If you've watched the other movies this is highly recommended (of course, if you watched part 1, this is a must).

A slight editorial (and I know I am going to get slammed for writing it)- giving 1 or 2 stars because you don't like the digital distribution (the one that every movie I bought in the last year is using and I've had 0 problems with)?  This makes no sense what so ever to me.  I think I'll give a restaurant a terrible review because even though the food was cooked to perfection , the service was impeccable and the bottle of Chteau Margaux was beyond belief, I didn't care for the sprig of parsley on one plate....",1325980800,,1167,4.395348837209302

I don't understand it in any way, and I keep hoping that someone somewhere will begin to address situations like this. There has to be a ""consumer watchdog,"" who takes care of something like this.

The wording on the packaging is ambiguous. If you are fortunate enough to talk to someone representing these people, who will meet someone arrogant enough to believe that they will use this system, regardless what buyers want.

There is only one answer, and it is not to buy a product like this. And if you are not an idealist, then do it for the simple reason that you don't want to be ripped off.",1325894400,2,766,4.503597122302159
3817854,3,B001UV4XIS,"The 3 stars are for the movie being good, great price and the fact that I was able to get an iTunes digital copy.

As many others have indicated Warner Bros has made an idiotic decision to move to ultraviolet as a ""digital"" format which is nothing more than streaming (you can't use this on your iPad/iphone etc like you were in the past just by downloading in iTunes. I had read reviews and was aware of this new format and the fact that you had to download a bunch of other things you may not want/need. I only bought this blurry/dvd set because it dropped down to $15 and I did enjoy the movie and wanted to add it to my collection of Harry Potter movies. I read that someone had actually gone to ultraviolet/flixter support page and sent an email complaining of their frustration at having to have a streaming copy rather than an actual digital copy like advertised etc. and they received an iTunes code for a digital copy of this movie. So I decided to give it a go and luckily flixter/WB was smart enough to know (even though they just had to mention many people are happy with this new format) that they should fix their mistake. I received an iTunes code which worked and I am happily able to load this on my iPhone and any other device I take with me on trips without needing to worry about having access or even signing up for flixter and services I neither need nor want. I don't know if this is something they're planning on doing for everyone who writes them a complaint but if you're unhappy and you bought this version just send them a complaint, you have nothing to lose and it's worth it if you can get an iTunes compatible version. Also as a side note I never tried the ultraviolet code or downloaded flixter etc I just stated that I was upset that I was required to download a bunch of things just to view my digital copy. They also required my ultraviolet code as proof of purchase

That's bad news for Warner Bros., which was hoping that a major franchise like Harry Potter could help introduce even more new users to the UltraViolet digital format.
It's such bad news, in fact, that Flixster has sought to appease unhappy users by offering them the ability to download the movie for free from Apple's iTunes instead.""
I returned my Blu-ray combo set. I do not care if it goes on sale or what kind of deal is made. I contacted customer service and tried dealing with them multiple times in multiple ways. I took different advice from people online. I never received any iTunes code. I'm done with Ultra Violet and Flixster. It should not be that much work to own a film and obtain a true digital copy. If I purchase another item with Ultra Violet and Flixster then I'm telling movie makers that this is what I want and that this is how I want to be treated. Well, this is not what I want at all and this is not how we should be treated as consumers.
These iTunes codes are a last minute panic effort on the part of Ultra Violet and Flixster. This Harry Potter film is the biggest and most important film they are a part of and they know they botched things up royally. In order to get the Amazon ratings above a one to two star rating, Ultra Violet and Flixster had to do something as soon as possible. So a desperate company apparently started giving away a few codes to some customers. Too bad not all the customers were so lucky. Apparently what Amazon reviewers have to say matters. Well, at least the ratings matter to them. If we give Ultra Violet and Flixster products good reviews then they will continue to add Flixster and Ultra Violet onto our favorite and most beloved movies. And we will no longer have real digital copies as we were once used to. This one time appeasement of an iTunes code will most likely never happen again.
I'm not sure how long the Ultra Violet/Flixster streaming copy (digital copy) version is supposed to last on one's computer. Someone mentioned it said somewhere in small print (on an insert) it was only supposed to last a few years and then the purchaser would no longer have ownership of the film unless they wanted to re-purchase it. I'm not sure if this is true or not. Of course, this ""one time"" HP iTunes code should be safe if it is directly from Apple. But other movies with Ultra Violet and Flixster may have an issue in a few years if what people have mentioned is correct. You may want to check out the small print and ask Ultra Violet or Flixster about it if you decide to purchase one of their films. . This is based on my experience with this product and my experience with Ultra Violet & Flixster customer service. I spoke with others who had similar issues with this product. I hope this helps you make an informed decision. I'm reviewing the product. The film was good. Amazon customer service was good.",1325635200,4,3122,4.450261780104712

3817940,1,B001UV4XIS,"I'm not reviewing the movie itself, but rather want to address the digital copy. Instead of using the industry standard iTunes / Windows Media options as in the past, Warner Brothers is trying to push their own proprietary ""Ultraviolet"" content protection scheme. So, not only do you need to download the Flixster app on your desktop + your mobile device, but you need TWO new accounts (Flixter and Ultraviolet) to keep track of and log into.

This isn't being done to combat piracy, meanwhile, it's just a cash grab. WB hopes users will switch from iTunes to Flixster and share more personal information with WB. But unlike iTunes, all you get is a horrible and inconsistent user experience, one that I predict is likely to disappear in a few years rendering your digital copy worthless (as opposed to iTunes, which is currently a monster and powerhouse).

WB needs to get their heads out of their behinds and realize that if they make digital copies hard to work with, people will save money and buy the regular disk, then crack the encryption and make their own with the Handbrake converter software. Additionally, what the heck is up with all of these digital copies having EXPIRATION DATES? I bought Deathly Hallows Pt1 and couldn't get the digital copy because I waited for it to go on sale. Another reason to make your own digital copies is that you can't be punished for not buying on launch day.",1325376000,2,1404,4.726530612244898

This review does not reflect the film, which is easily 5 stars, but rather this version of it. If you are the sort of person who pays a little extra for the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy, you are going to find Ultraviolet to be severely lacking. Warner Bros had a great thing going with the Windows Media/iTunes digital copy; it was something everyone could use because everyone already has one of those two platforms. No one has Flixster as a digital movie repository, let's be realistic. All this does is fragment the idea of a digital movie collection, no longer can you just go to your computer and pick out the movie you want, you have to remember what service it is stored under, what password you use to get to that service, etc.",1325116800,,826,4.47682119205298

At first, I wasn't happy that the last movie was split into two movies, but I felt that they did a good job with the split and keeping the plot moving. This last movie covers one day, but that one day takes up 1/3 of the book. It has great action and my favorite scene from the entire series was Snape's Worst Memories. It was incredibly moving and explained everything while tying in all the books. It was amazing. Great movie.",1325030400,,471,4.303370786516854
3818005,4,B001UV4XIS,"The only reason I watched this film was because I'd watched the rest of the series and to be honest I wasn't really that impressed with any of them.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan but that is mainly down to the books rather than the films.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II has changed my opinion about the films though and I really think it did the book justice.  The actors really blossomed in this film and the special effects were nothing short of fantastic... even Daniel Radcliffe could (almost) be classed as an actor.  The supporting characters were incredible and the film really finished off the series in a good light.

I hope that my children will love Harry Potter as much as I have during these last few years.  I'm very sad that it has come to an end but hopefully the magic will live on for years to come... and you never know, Rowling may have something else up her sleeve.

Then your copy expires, and you no longer have any digital copy at all!  Furthermore, I want a digital copy that I can download onto my iPod and watch when I am in locations with no internet.

The extras added to the Blu Ray expeience such as ""Maximum Movie Mode"" have embeded so much information onto the dvd that it is impossible to get through the normal run of the movie itself.  The problem, and I have encountered this upon occasion with others, is that every 15 minutes or so of the movie, it ""backtracks"" and resets to the beginning of the scene just viewed.  To get through the movie either requires fast forwarding through what was just watched and hitting play to resume or simply don't watch the blu ray version at all and watch the standard back up dvd provided.  What a complete waste of time and money.  This was most frustrating when we opened the package on Christmas to view it with family and everyone was so frustrated that it was pointless to finish.  Where is the quality control, Amazon?  I suggest you notify your distributor and their supplier that this is unacceptable manufacturing practice.

J.K rowling is getting CHEAP. They could have added 'Tour Shell Cottage'. I just regret buying the double disc, since there isn't anything to do on the second disk. The first was awesome, but the second disc sucked. If you want to save a few dollars, buy the single disc. The deleted scenes do come on the first disc, but I was disapointed that they didn't have a deleted scene with explaining about Arianna, Dumbledore's sister. I read the books and know the story of Arianna was one or two chapters long!

But they won't be getting any more money from me for that Ultraviolet crap in any DVD  I decide to purchase in the future.

Then, to watch the movie, you have to add a Flixster app to your iPad or iPhone, or even to your flippin' PC! Seriously - you can't just download then to iTunes. You have to use this annoying app that looks like a popcorn box.

3818120,1,B001UV4XIS,"I feel like I have to read the books because Yates is an AWFUL director, the guy has no business screwing anything beyond his Doctor No series, and how anybody involved in the project was willing to stand behind him after his intial takeover is Rowlings greatest folly, and a stain on a series that could've easily been a star better every movie he was involved in.

I am CRITICAL, and let's just say all of his work is amateurish at best to anything Peter Jackman has ever worked on, and his hyperconcentration on lighting, scene, and tackiness of needing everything to tightly fit hit its final note in these last 2 movies, making each character more of a paper cut out devoid of any life, character, and the things one cherished about every character in the 1st movie.

Rowling may have got her financial kicks out of this, but for everyone who actually cares about good writing, cinematography that showcases characters (not buries them or makes it easy to ignore their lack of inspiration), and a complete story that meshes everything into one stupendous fireworks ending, these final movies will put the nail in the coffin, and just plain piss off/depress you if you've actually been buying the blue ray collection of them.  Don't deny it either folks, by the middle of Part 1 you were almost asleep, and by the 1st 10 mins of Part 2 you wouldn't have cared if every character got covered in hot magma and the whole thing was over.

Yates is NOT big skills movie director, should never have been given a shot like this yet again, and I'll skip on the rest of Rowling's future works because letting this kind of MTV Video crapzola to made of your work isn't more than a hop, skip, and a jump from becoming the next Twilight books/movies.  Sad day for Potter fans, I suggest you just stick to the books and settle with the fact that some authors are only in the business to make money, and in Rowlings case to make money off the movies (not me, when I become the next great Epic Fantasy writer gone Epic Movie Series, I PROMISE to never let this happen, and shame the Twlights of the world for crapping on the art of storytelling in the name of the $ sign only!).

3818128,5,B001UV4XIS,"I do not give a hoot about the availability of digital copies, it is not something I use or care about since once a film is 10 or 12 years old it will be streaming all over the place on my subscription service anyway. For me blue ray is fine and having the standard DVD with it for now is nice if you still have devices that don't have blue ray drives on hand like I do. So all the issues people were having w/ Ultraviolet and digital rights/availability are not an issue for me and my rating is based on the film itself.

This is now one of my favorites of the Harry Potter films, perhaps the one I like the best of all. Well done! A really fitting end to this series, it doesn't disappoint, brings all the loose ends together neatly and retains the ""epic adventure"" aspect of the earlier films. Plus, it offers a more mature moral, ethical, and philosophical ""message"" in its content that is understated in the other films but rightly so. The characters are just now at adulthood where the depth of these issues becomes meaningful and realized.

After watching it I went back and watched Part 1 again. I was disappointed in Part 1 the first time around and did not find it up to par with the other films - thought it was dull, the plot dragged, and lacked the innovative and engaging aspects and little details of Rowling's ""world"" that the other films demonstrated. I have to say that Part I seems much much better to me after watching Part 2, especially given the culmination of the deeper messaging I just described in the above paragraph of this review.

Overall I have been really pleased with this series of films and found the end of the story to be well executed and satisfying despite that they are a children's story. But then again this was the original intent of Star Wars and Tolkien wrote the Hobbit initially for his own children.

Adult friends of mine suggested I read the Potter books and so I have started on the first, breezing through it of course. Rowling is no Tolkien, let me just say that. The story elements engage, but the writing is remarkably curt and pedestrian, even for a children's novel. I have been told this improves/becomes more age appropriate as one moves on through the books, though.

I must say I enjoy and am thoroughly entertained by the little world and characters Rowling has created and so enjoy the films immensely no doubt due to the high quality of the productions as far as script, direction, acting, costume, sets, and effects are concerned.

Top notch all the way around. I recommend the entire series if you enjoy the fantasy genre but struggle to find HIGH QUALITY production outside of the LOTR series.",1324339200,2,2660,4.508298755186722

3818139,3,B001UV4XIS,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" is a two-hour, action-packed conclusion to the Harry Potter saga. I can't say that it is especially climactic. The film suffers from being separated from ""Part 1"" and left to simply play out the final battle. ""Part 2"" isn't as strong as ""Part 1"", dramatically or thematically, and it is disorienting to pick up the story on the beach just after Dobby the Elf has been buried. Now the trio of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) conspire to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's (Helena Bonham Carter) vault at Gringott's in search of another of Voldemort's horcruxes, in which the Dark Lord harbors a part of his soul. From there it is on to Hogwart's, now under virtual marshal law, to prepare to confront Voldemort face-to-face.

This material would have fared better if Warner Brothers hadn't split Harry Potter's final year into two films. All of the thematic substance and dramatic tension were in ""Part 1"", so we have forgotten about it in the intervening months. Talk of the Deathly Hallows is easily confused with the horcruxes, as they are both objects being sought, and the audience has probably forgotten why. This film is dedicated to the final battle, which is anticlimactic, because the build-up that would make the confrontation with Voldemort significant was in the earlier film. Meaningful interaction between characters is limited, in favor of action, so the actors just seem to be going through the motions. There is plenty of superfluous material that could have been cut from both films to create a single 3-hour-plus extravaganza. Bifurcating the finale doesn't do it justice.

As both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" are available on DVD now, one might be tempted to watch them back-to-back. That might make ""Part 2"" more coherent, suspenseful, and give it some context, but I doubt that children or most adults will have the patience for a four-and-a-half-hour marathon. The unnecessary scenes will be all the more apparent. If Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh were able to compress ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" into 3 hours and 20 minutes, David Yates and Steve Clove should have been able to do the same with Harry Potter.

3818143,3,B001UV4XIS,"I liked seeing the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. It was, I believe, the darkest movie of the bunch, even darker than ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".

I know, I know, it's supposed to be good versus evil, but how convincing would someone who is evil be if it was always dark around them? Might that be a tip off? No, in my experience, evil usually presents itself in a more comely manner.

I thought the movie suffered from what ailed almost all of the later movies, the movies based on big books, in that you really had to have read the book in order to understand (at least part of) the movie. These movies don't stand on their own; they are like in jokes that you must know a certain something in order to get.

These movies also suffered from taking too long to make, and the characters aged far too much for the supposed time spent. It's too bad that the films couldn't have been made much closer together, even if they were released later. The three main characters looked a lot better in the first movies than in the end.

Speaking of the end, I thought this movie's end was a let down, a petering out rather than a finish. The movie seemed to be going through the motions, the obligatory motions at that.

Yes, I have criticisms of this movie, but I'm pleased it finally came out. Nevertheless, it would be nice if there were more movies like the first two Harry Potter movies, with more awe and wonder. Kids grow up and many become troubled and sullen, shy, self-conflicted, and unsure, but I an not certain that makes for good movies.

Of the three main characters, in the movies, only Hermione (Emma Watson) did a credible job throughout. Radcliffe is sometimes difficult to watch, especially in his non-HP roles I have seen. Ron (Rupert Grint) is okay, but never as good as he was when younger. And, sadly, there was too little of Maggie Smith in the last movie. Her role took an enormous hit in the editing, it seems.

It's too bad Peter Jackson didn't make these movies.",1324080000,,1984,4.434065934065934

I think they're doing the same thing with Kung Fu Panda 2.  I followed the advice of another review, and bought the Harry Potter 3D Blu Ray (it says it's region free - so it sounds like it will play on any Blu Ray machine)from Amazon.co.uk.

They are doing this for HP7-2, not sure about other releases. Go to [...] and submit a support ticket and tell them you don't want a flixter account.

Hallows looked and felt like a movie trying to find an end, and it finally did. Acting and special effects were excellent, but the Steve Kloves' screenplay left me wanting.

It's hard to believe that both JK Rowling and Warner Bros. Pictures would let such a successful franchise die, so I see a bright future for Harry Potter adventures, no doubt with a completely new slate of actors and characters. Perhaps Harry becomes the headmaster at Hogwarts and stumbles onto another Tom Riddle, or we skip a generation and pick up with the adventures of Albus Potter. It's impossible to predict, but I'm sure Harry will be back in one form or another. I'll be a happy camper when that happens.",1323820800,,812,4.71830985915493

We have tried and tried to understand Neville Longbottom's lines but there are lines that we just don't know what he is trying to say.

If you are a true Potterhead, don't even hesitate just buy it!!

The words 'Thank You' would never be enough to express my gratitude towards this woman. She gave me a childhood, a home, a family, a place to go when I felt that the world didn't want me. She gave me a fandom to take part in, and one I will gladly serve in for the rest of my life. She gave me advice, and she gave me bravery and hope. She changed my life more than anyone else in the world, and if I ever have the honor of meeting her, I won't even know what to say because no words will ever amount to what I have to say. She changed my life in a way that no one else ever has.

Why would I want to watch a Digital Copy at my computer, when I've got the DVD and Blu-Ray??? And if I'm watching on the move, do I want to use 10% of my entire month's bandwidth over 3G? Will it even look good that way? No, I want a copy in iTunes so I can transfer it over a wire, and let my girls watch it in the van. Like the dozens of other movies I do this with.

Be very careful of the Digital Copy brand, and especially this silly Ultraviolet version. To watch two movies this way I had to create THREE different accounts (one with Flixster, one with Ultraviolet, and one with Universal). And in the shuffle I seem to have lost the promised free one.

Definitely avoid this. Buy a version without digital copy, the movie's good, but this flavor of Digital Copy is terrible.

As anyone who has read the series will tell you, there is a big difference between what happened in the book and the movie and this goes for just about all of them. I didn't even read the series til after seeing all of the movies. Needless to say, I don't think I was alone in being shocked at many of the ""revelations"" in the original stories as compared to the movies and I won't mention them here. I never thought of Harry Potter as just a ""children's "" story after seeing the first movie but I was too lazy to sit down with the book. Glad I did, they are much better but having said that, these movies are a work of art in themselves and I'll be watching them again. I'm going to wait for the really good DVD set with real extras though. If this one had more I'd have given this a higher rating on the review.

Harry and ""He Who Shall Not be Named"" was a sight to be seen (though honestly that was the ONLY scene worthy of the 3D price in the theater lol). Good vs Evil!!

To be honest, I did prefer when movies just came with an iTunes card code so I could get it through iTunes, that seemed easier.  However, like I mentioned I normally do not use the digital copies with the movie.

One of the things I found to be lacking is that Harry didn't talk to Dumbledore in that special place as much or at all thru out the movie as he did in the book. After I watched the movie I was thinking that may have been smart on the movies side of this. I don't know, it is just there where parts of the book that would or could be a part of the movie. One thing I thought that I had remembered was that Harry had keep the wand the Snape had taken from Dumbledore, but in the movie Harry destroyed the wand. I would have like to have seen Harry keep the wand as in the book. I am glad that the 19 year after segment was put in. I was afraid the it would not be included. One thing I really liked in the movie was the quick departure of the Malfoy's and if I remember right, the Malfoy's where not in the 19 years later part. It was like the Malfoy's where all ""We the Malfoy's are certified Witch's and wizards"". The Malfoy's where shoving it up everybody's behind that they where better than anybody and everybody in Hogwarts.

3818281,5,B001UV4XIS,"HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.

However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: ""Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt."" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was ""off"" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.

Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as ""Snape."" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.

An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many ""surprises"" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.

Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.

Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.",1323129600,,2055,5.0146627565982405

But why did they have to make things up that were not even there to begin with -- when the source material was so well written? A few examples: What's with that weird speech of Neville's when the one in the book made so much more sense and in the film it was just odd and maudlin? What's with Harry grabbing Voldemort and saying ""Let's finish this like we started, Tom, together"" and hurling the two of them off the bridge? Nowhere in the book; hard to believe Voldemort/Riddle would let Potter get that close, even in his weakened condition. And back to Neville ... ok, he ""fancies"" Luna; again, not in the book, but nowhere else in 7/1 or 7/2 is there even a hint that he ""fancies"" Luna or anyone else -- in #4 he even goes to the Yule Ball with Ginny. And what's with making McGonigle, after she charms the statues to defend the school, to titter ""I always wanted to use that charm""??? Totally unnecessary and weakens the import of the moment.

Yet I give it three out of five because it looks so good, the performances are first rate, the score is beautiful.

3818301,2,B001UV4XIS,"When you see ""digital copy included"" on a DVD case, you (rightly) assume there will be a movie file you can just download onto your desktop/laptop/other device for accessing later. Access is the key term here. Ultraviolet lets you access your digital file but only when you're around an Internet connection. No more watching movies offline with this service so now you're at the mercy of bandwidth limitations and, in turn, you can reduce the bandwidth of others at your home by having to stream this content whenever you want to watch it.

Why was this decision made? Well the easy answer is money. Plus they are trying to kickstart their new service and the only way to do that is to FORCE people into your service. Why would people want two Netflix accounts (Ultraviolet and Netflix both stream)? They don't, the movie companies are hoping you'll ditch Netflix and sign on with their new service. It's garbage, but these are the times we live in.

The movie itself? It's wonderful. It's adult. The kids aren't children anymore and the dark realities they've lived through have taken all the innocent shine off of wizardry and magic and it's all about friendship and survival now. I kind of wish this series had gone on longer, now that it's over, but J.K. Rowling certainly did a good job of tying up all the loose ends, even if there was more we wanted to explore before the curtain came down.

Whereas ""Deathly Hallows 1"" felt like the ultimate game of hide and seek for Potter and his friends, in this last installment, the group of friends collects what they feel they need to fight and then they stand up and fight. And what a battle royale it was.

It's a shame the movie studio gimped what was a nice package with discs and digital copies. Perhaps studios felt there was too much piracy going on with digital copies or that they would rather have some sort of data aggregation to know how well their service works. But the digital copy represented here is not what we consumers have come to expect from the term. If we don't actually own the digital copy, then why say we are getting one? Perhaps ""get access to a streamed version of this movie via our proprietary system that you need to sign up for"" just doesn't sound good to marketers. So let's call it the same thing and the public can just deal with it. That's my guess.",1322697600,2,2336,4.541567695961995

3818310,4,B001UV4XIS,"Like most other people I was VERY disappointed to learn that the Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be used on an iPod. The only reason I buy DVDs/BDs that come with digital copies is so that I can put them in iTunes for use on my iPod and I have always been willing to pay a little more for that feature.  I was planning on ordering a copy from Amazon UK as some others suggested in hopes that the digital copy code they include would work with iTunes, but then I saw the product discussion thread below about Flixster giving out codes for iTunes for customers who complained.  I went ahead and ordered this three disc combo and crossed my fingers.  My disc set arrived yesterday and I immediately sent a message to Flixster customer support at support.ultraviolet.flixster.com saying that I was disappointed that the Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be used with my iPod and gave them the code for my digital copy that was included in my disc case.  In less than 5 minutes they responded with an apologetic form letter that included a code for an iTunes copy of the film.  My movie is downloading into iTunes as I write this review!  I am not happy about the push for Ultraviolet digital copies, but I am very pleased that Flixster has been so quick to respond to customer complaints and is going the extra mile by giving out iTunes codes.  They will also still let you use your code for your Ultraviolet copy if you want. In regards to the film itself, I thought it was a great finale to a much loved series. Of course it wasn't as good as the book, but what movie ever is?  I really appreciate how much effort was put into the production of these films.  The sets are fantastic and there is so much attention to all of the little details that make these stories so wonderful.  There is no way that everything from the books could ever be incorporated into film, but it is so much fun to see the stories brought to life on screen.  I can't wait to share both the books and the movies with my children when they are older!",1322524800,4,2020,4.388739946380697

Had I not seen it several times before I would not have known what I was missing -- frustrating!!!  It ain't my TV, other movies look fine.  This needs to be redone more carefully.  A real bummer.

3818312,2,B001UV4XIS,"Disappointing. Really disappointing. Terribly, terribly, terribly terriblyterriblyterriblyterribly disappointing. When I read the book, I could see the film in my mind's eye, the great final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort so well described by Jo Rowling, with Harry holding all the cards and Voldemort not knowing it. With the magnificent twist in the tale at the end. AND IT WASN'T THERE!!! AAAAAAGHHHH!! We get some hamfisted travesty of an ending that's about as far as one can get from the book. Instead of ending with a bang, it ends with a CGI-enhanced whimper. The climax to the whole series and the film makers bottle it completely. How could they have done this? How could Ms. Rowling have let them? This film needs a remake.

Now it is acknowledged that it's simply not possible to put the whole complexity of Rowling's world into a film for Muggle audiences, and that leaving some bits out is inevitable and will upset someone or other. However, none of the other books have been subjected to the wholesale butchery of this one. It's truncated, brutally hacked about and has a total travesty of an ending. If you enjoy the book, wait for the remake. You'll wait forever, do you say? That's not such a bad thing.

I give it two stars for the few good bits that are there, and for the whole marvellous Rowling concept. It deserved better than this. If there are any folk out there who have read and liked the book, and are interested in seeing this, take my advice, don't. Believe me, the version you have conjured up in your imagination will be far, far better.",1322524800,8,1582,4.728260869565218

Also, this movies 3d is MUCH better than part 1's 3d. I don't know what it was so bad. If I had to guess, the producers got part 2 ready for the theaters, taking time to make it the best it could be, and then rushed part 1 just to make money on bluray release.",1322265600,,520,3.642857142857143

3818326,1,B001UV4XIS,"I heard the movie is great, one family member saw it and agrees, but none of the rest of us is so far able to see it with this set. I suspect that we eventually will see the regular DVD. We were hoping to see it in Blu-Ray though, and eventually in 3D, but apparently although our TV is capable, we need a compatible player. I can understand that for the 3-D but making it so difficult for the honest buyer to view the Blu-Ray disc is ridiculous.

What gripes me is the error messages we get trying to play the Blu-Ray: Your system is not compatible with HDCP, BD playback is disabled. (ErrorCode=3106) or ""The content is protected. The content is not allowed to play in the current display mode. Or other ""Not HDCP compliant.""

In other words, we pay for the set, but since our hardware is sufficient to play it, but not sufficiently new and up to date to meet some copy protection standard, we are penalized for buying the product.

If you do not have all the latest and greatest equipment, you might want to inquire first with Warner Brothers as to whether you will be able to play the Blu-Ray. What a shame!

Perhaps someone more sophisticated about Blu-Ray discs can expound, all I know is we have not yet managed to play it! So much for relaxing while watching a movie, more like hours of stress, frustration, and disappointment.

As for the Ultraviolet issue, you can still download the movie into your computer (or other devices) so that you don't have to stream it.  If anything UltraViolet seems to have added some new features to the digital copy option.  For instance, let's say you go to a friend's house and you want to watch this movie.  However, you don't have the physical disc or your computer with you.  Solution:  You can stream it!  If you don't want to stream it, Solution:  download it and save it on your hard drive.  Simple, wouldn't you say?  The previous generation of Digital Copy only allowed you to download the movie (no streaming option).

Previous generation Digital Copy:  Download and Save only option
UltraViolet Digital Copy:  Download and Save and/or Streaming options

To me, it is the same as any other product: if you don't like something about it, you either a) do not purchase it, or b) purchase it, and suck it up that it isn't as perfect as you want.

At the moment, the only way to know how the Harry Potter saga ends is to read the last book, this movie kept us from knowing how it actually does end.
This Movie is a Bogus invention, a story very UNLIKE than the one written by J.K. Rowling as the Last Harry Potter Book, and a misrepresentation of the Last Deathly Hallows Book. . It is like buying a movie about The Sinking of the Titanic, and discovering you paid for a movie about the sinking of the Andrea Doria.  I certainly felt cheated because I was scammed into buying a movie that simply was not the ending of the Harry Potter series as the author wrote it.

Also for all the people who obsess over the digital delivery of this movie, THAT is NOT A MOVIE REVIEW.  The Quality of a Movie in a review is all about the movie itself.  Great Movies are Great even when the digital delivery system employed stinks, and a Lousy Movie like this one doesn't become better or worse because of how it was delivered to you. Hudson Hawk was a lousy movie, how it was delivered never affected that fact.  Try learning what a Movie Review is before wasting everyones time.

I would simply add that all this is fiction, make believe, and not in any way real or even possible.  Harry Potter is a brilliant invention from the mind of author J.K. Rowling, and we owe her for this truly wonderful invention, but never forget that it is only an invention with no connection to anything real beyond we who read it.  God is real, His Only begotten son Jesus is real, the Holy Spirit is real, but Harry Potter is not.  God is an absolute truth, one you may depend on, seek and find,  a truth and reality you can learn from which makes God very unlike myth and fiction.",1322006400,9,1866,4.260623229461756

If you are interested in purchasing this product, then you probably already know the plot. The effects are good, the plot is fairly faithful to the book.
The reason for my negative review is the Ultraviolet digital copy.  It isn't a real digital copy.  It's a temporary license to stream the video.  I have all the other digital copies...  Guess I'm buying this one from itunes.
Seriously, don't waste your money on this fake digital copy...  But definitely buy the movie.

This movie has the most action and the best drama compared to the other movies in the franchise. Alan Rickman should have been nominated for the Beat Supporting Actor Academy Award. His performance is awesome. Most of the actors have stepped up their acting game in this finale, which picks up where the seventh movie leaves off. The Battle of Hogwarts, which is most of the movie, is epic. The director did a nice job on this one. It is truly a pleasure to watch...

But I suggest you spend your money on a bluray without the ultraviolet copy (because that really is a waste of money).",1321920000,6,1218,4.504545454545455
3818351,1,B001UV4XIS,"Let me start by saying I love the Harry Potter books. I have read them many times through and they are some of my favorite books of all time. In no way do I expect the wonder and magic of those books to be translated perfectly to the silver-screen. It just can't be done and I readily accept that. The successes of the movies have been very hit or miss to me and this final movie could not have missed by a wider margin. The visuals are lukewarm and underwhelming. The wand battles are a joke. And, some of the scenes chosen to be included in the movie baffle me while they left other pivotal points fall by the way side.

While I would have loved for these things to be better, these are all mistakes that could have been forgiven if the movie had good acting. The acting is the biggest thing marring the success of this film. It is, in spots, laughably bad. I realize it is hard to gauge talent when you are picking 10 year olds to star in your decade-spanning movie saga, but there has to be a point where you cut your losses. If they just can't act, you gotta let 'em go. Continuity be damned.

Overall this was the worst movie I saw all summer and I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even die hard fans of the movies. It is a great disappointment and a serious letdown to a movie series that could have benefited from a spectacular ending.

And yes, this movie is even worse than Cowboys & Aliens. At least that looked cool.",1321920000,2,1434,4.207272727272727

I'm a huge fan of the books (and was before seeing any of the movies), and while changes were made they fit the movie format. This was a must a own for me.

But a comment on all the 1 star reviews. The app you use to stream the digital copy (Flixster) now allows you to download the movie locally to your device or computer. So ease up folks. I'm glad to be able to stream it anywhere AND download it locally if I want. I don't need a 2GB file taking up space if I'm not using it. At least this way it's safe and I can download it whenever I want, then delete it, and download it again later if I need to.

Yes, there were several changes and cuts between the book and the movie - some of them major - but the end result was still a coherent film that captured the key elements of the story and the spirit of the book.

3818359,5,B001UV4XIS,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since there were only 3 books.  I had heard about them and decided to try them when I found them in large paperback form at my local Walmart (since replaced with hardback).  I got the third book elsewhere (in hardback) and purchased each of the subsequent books as they were issued.

I purchased each movie in DVD or VHS (early ones since replaced with DVD) as it came out as well.  I had not seen Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 before I received the DVD and could not turn it off!

From the start of the movie it was almost non-stop tension and almost as much action!  You had to keep watching it.  It helped tremendously if you have read the book but it would be exciting anyway.

There were a few differences between the book and movie but that was to be expected.  I'm glad they allowed Neville his moment of glory against Nagini.

One odd point, though.  At the end with the group older - why did Harry's and Ginny's daughter have red hair like her and both boys have black hair like him?  Similar for Ron and Hermione.  The girl looked like her and the boy looked like him.  A bit overly stereotypical but not enough to detract from the movie.  I just wish they would have put that last comment about Neville in that section.

Such as attributing and giving the credit and line to Hermoine about using the dragon when in the book it was Harry's idea and few other minor changes.

Almost 100% of the one star ratings are regarding the ultraviolet digital copy and not about the actual movie.  So the overall three star rating for the movie is seriously skewed by the poor reviews about the digital copy and not the movie.

3818364,1,B001UV4XIS,"The ultra-violet *digital* copy is fraught with problems. I had planned on keeping the digital copy of this film on my Kindle Fire locally for a plane flight I had. Talk about a pipe dream. I couldn't even get the copy to play on a 10 month old laptop running XP, all updates, inside the Flixter application with the Flixter and Ultra-Violet accounts confirmed as operational (yes, you need both). During my support chat with a Flixster rep I was told to uninstall and re-install Flixster as the first troubleshooting step and without any information given other than my email address, what movie I was working with and what platform I was on. The rep, David, asked me three (3)! times what type of internet connection I had. Surprise, surprise it never worked on that laptop either. Save yourself USD5 and just get the blu-ray or regular DVD depending on your taste - the ultra-violet digital copy is a waste of money and time spent trying to make it viewable. I won't ever buy another ultra-violet digital copy. Nor would I use Flixster for anything media related.

EDIT - adding a comment I posted to someone complaining about all the one-star reviews being *invalid* because I think it's germane to my point:

""There are plenty of instances where AMZN users will unfairly criticize a product because it was shipped late, it arrived damaged or for some other clearly invalid reason - I hate that. This is not one of those situations. To say that anyone who gave the product one star because of the hideous and unusable ultra-violet digital copy is wrong in doing so, is off-base. The digital copy is key to the purchase for many people - it costs USD5 more because of its inclusion. If anything it might serve as a call to have AMZN sequester the groups of reviews from one another (blu-ray vs blu-ray + digital etc...) - in the meantime, it's perfectly just to post a well thought out, negative review because of that poor digital copy.

By your logic, all three copies of the film (Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital) as sent by AMZN could be non-functioning on a massive scale (as is the case with the ultra-violet copy), but everyone would still be obliged to leave a favorable review because the movie was really entertaining when you saw it in the theater? It doesn't make any sense.""",1321833600,5,2283,4.646039603960396

They should have cut Part One down to about 30~45 minutes, and merged that remainder into the beginning of Part Two, then released the whole as a 2:30 or perhaps 3:00 hour movie and be done.  Part One dragged on so badly I almost lost interest.  Part Two is exciting, has great visuals and plot, and moves along at a pace that keeps me interested.  The actual movie length is just at 2 hours.  Add in about 10 minutes of credits and you get the 130 minute length as advertised.

Rating Part Two at five stars for the movie.  I never rated Part One, but it would have been three stars at best because so little was accomplished during the time they took.  Like I said, the studio really milked the last book for all they could -- knowing it was the end of a very successful series.

Noticing that hundreds of people have hopped onto this product review page to give it one star for the UltraViolet streaming digital copy included in the Multi-format package.  While I personally could not care less for the digital copies of any movie, I certainly understand the anger about this issue.

1) It's a streaming form instead of a digital copy.
2) It does not match what was delivered with Part One, or any of the previous movies in the series.  That means that anyone with a digital library of the movies that wants to watch the series offline . . . cannot.  It breaks the collection.
3) It's STILL a digital copy that punishes legal customers but does zero to punish actual pirates.  This last statement is unfortunately true of previous digital copy methods that use online registration based DRM.

When will the studios learn that to succeed at digital delivery they need to make it seamless and flawless for their paying customers?

Having said that, I still feel like 5 stars for this edition is deserved.  I'm rating the quality of the movie, the Bluray disks and the packaging here.  If I were to rate the digital copy, I would rate ALL digital copies a one because of their DRM.  Not just UltraViolet . . .

After having to subscribe to 3 different services (Flixster, Ultraviolet, and getsatisfaction.com for Flixster help) downloading over 4 GB of software to both my computer and phone, I had the oportunity to either stream the movie from the Flixster website, or download the movie to my phone.  The streaming version was unacceptably choppy, and frequently buffering (despite connecting over Wifi to DSL).  The downloadable version took almost an hour, and once again, had to be done directly to the phone.

In the middle of the night, McAfee Security Center detected that the Flixster software was trying to make contact with a website that it considered to be ""unsafe"".  I do not know if it is truely unsafe of if McAfee is not familiar with it yet, but I am obviously concerned.

I understand that Warner Brothers doesn't want Apple to be the universal choice for movies through portable devices, but this is unforgivably bad.

I have a bit of conflicting feelings about this movie, at one side I think it was a worthy end to the series, it was dramatic, grandiose and epic like it was supposed to be, but at the same time the movie did feel a bit tame here and there and while it is a very good movie I sort of had hoped for more. Part 2 continues the fetch quest from the last movie and then escalates into a fantasy war movie. The special effects are very good and it do keep a nice balance between action, drama and character development. Each major character get their change to shine and none is left forgotten. The conclusion feel satisfying and unlike many movie franchises the Harry Potter movies have one continuous story that do properly end. Now as I say the movie do have a good end, but it sort of feel a bit watered down. I have been trying for days to put my finger on what exactly I mean but I just can't. When watching the other Harry Potter movies I was completely enthralled, I forgot about my popcorn, about anything else and for the duration of the movie nothing else mattered, Deathly Hallows part 2 was engaging to, but not to that degree, at time I found myself thinking about other things and when it was done I was thinking, hum...good movie, good end to the series, but something is missing.

Perhaps what I am looking for is that the movie felt to polished, it was good, dark and gritty at times, but because it had to cover so much material in such a short amount of time it lacked the litter quirks and character interactions which made the other movies feel real, when the characters did interact it felt much more scripted. So much of the later half of the movie depend on the viewer caring what happens to the characters, and that part felt a bit rushed.

Now other than the complaint above I have nothing but good things to say about part 2. The music is great, the effects is great, the story is great, the acting is great, the camera work and other theatrical details is great. The director have had a big budget for this movie and have spent it wisely and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2 is a gorgeous movie. I think perhaps the last Harry Potter book should have been parted into three rather than two parts to give the director more time to let the story develop, but with the time alloted by the format I think everyone involved with this movie did a good job. I recommend this movie to fans of the series, however if you are a newcomer to the series go back and start with the first movie and watch them in order.

It is refreshing to see a movie series get a worthy end, and this is a worthy end, it do provide a proper payoff for seeing all the other movies in the series and all round I think this is a good movie who do have some flaws but who really do a good job in telling a fantastic story.",1321747200,,3328,4.155038759689923

This is NOT a review of the last installment in the Harry Potter series which is a truly excellent finale. The Blu-ray version also seems to be a good addition to anyone's collection.

I just wanted to share with you my observations of the UltraViolet digital copy I am trying to access.  Warner Brothers really needs to work on this process. We are all pretty familiar with iTunes  - download the digital copy for which you have paid and watch it as you please according to the terms of your license.  With  UltraViolet you can't download a copy to your computer's hard drive and later transfer it among your devices as you can with iTunes.  Initially it offers just a streaming copy to the device of your choice. If you can figure out how to actually download a copy to your iPad or desktop, for example, it make take a half hour or more to get the entire copy - and it is in standard definition and for use only on that device. None of this seems to be user friendly - more Warner Brothers friendly, I guess.

Be wary of the UltraViolet Digital copy. If it suits your needs, that's great.  However, it isn't the simple process of adding a digital copy to your library as with iTunes. I still haven't gotten mine to work.  It may have been a better idea to simply download a copy through the iTunes store for use on my devices!

Oh, and please don't let this dissuade you from buying the Harry Potter DVD - you just may want to carefully consider the UltraViolet digital copy purchase. Be aware that it is not the same experience as with earlier digital copies purchased with DVDs.",1321660800,3,1900,5.116504854368932

Hollywood is without a doubt the most greedy arrogant pieces of work I have ever seen to shove this pile of steaming poop on people that have itunes libraries of legitimate digital copies that don't expire after 3 years is amazing to me.  Ultraviolet makes me to coin a phrase from another reviewer here ultraviolent towards the movie studios.

3818394,1,B001UV4XIS,"I know nothing about Flixster or Ultra Violet, or BluRay.  I just buy regular DVD's and play then on my TV set.  I never play them on my computer.  This one came in, in Ultra Violet, which was the only one besides Blu-Ray that they apparently sold. I don't have the equipment for Blu-Ray.

Since I haven't seen the regular DVD, I have no idea what the difference is between Ultra Violet and regular TV, or Blu Ray, and don't know where to get the regular Harry 2 on TV.  As to the film, well, it's definitely not the book, unfortunately.  It's one of those crazy Superman, Batman and other kid movies with all the blasting lights and crazy stuff which barely ever ends. Certainly didn't end as well as the book by far.  Scenes between characters barely exist.  If you like action, you'll love the film.  It's filled with it.

I would much rather have seen more of the story line, and much less of the action.  There was practically no story line at all. Just a chase and get 'em scene, blast and fire, death after death, one after the other.

I always liked the earlier DVD's the best because the stories were good and matched the book pretty quite well.  But this last one.  All I can say is YUK.  That's all.",1321660800,,1210,4.315555555555555

3818396,3,B001UV4XIS,"This terrible director, David Yates managed to butcher 2 of the Potter films.... Half blood prince and now the Deathly Hallows part 2. Some of these narcissistic directors think they have to put their own spin on rewriting movies for their own egos... despite the fact that the hundreds of millions of fans already liked the books as they were written and want to see a reasonable facsimile of the book they read... not some unrecognizable derivative by an ego-centric director who only cares about his own self gratification and not the audience.

The scenes were almost unrecognizable. The director managed to change the events in nearly every scene. Even the actors did not have their hearts in it. For the first time since the series began, they were simply reading the words of the script without any heart in what they were saying. It was obvious they also knew how the director was making a butchered, empty rewritten version of the final scenes... but their contracts usually prohibit them from making any negative remarks about the film in perpetuity.

Harry didn't even take the time to repair his wand before trashing the elder. They did get rid of the mindless rambling dialogue Rowlings had put into the last book. Some of the new dialogue also makes the details for the reason behind things much clearer... which was helpful... without the senseless babbling and with a lot less rambling words than Rowlings and we did not have to endure any of Rowling's sanctimonious speeches by Harry.

I barely recognized some of the scenes. Any high school kid could have made this film as Yates directed it. It is entirely the director's fault. All of his future films should be boycotted after this. He does not deserve to make any more films of any kind.

Shell cottage scenes were hacked to bits. The only 2 decent scenes in the entire movie were the scenes from Snapes memory which were excellent, albeit missing huge chunks due to the director's efforts to cut them to shreds. The scenes escaping Gringotts and where Voldemort killed every goblin in Gringotts... was the other portion which was among the better scenes. Some of the special effects of the preemptive spells by the teachers at Hogarts were well done by the special effects CGI artisans.

On a good note, Harry's role was less self-centered and less petulant than Rowlings wrote him. It was increasingly obvious in her last 4 books that she was growing tired of the forced deadlines due to the actors age constraints as she wrote the books. She was trying to turn the readers against him as she finished the series in the hope the demand for him would cease. She really wanted to kill him off at the end. At least in the films, this arrogance and self pitying martyrism was greatly diminished and almost totally gone in this last film... none of the insipid arrogance Harry had toward the others like Rowlings had written in the book... so that is one positive aspect of the film. I was also grateful not to have to listen to an entire film filled with the overacting and caustic voice of Bellatrix Lestrange except for the last 2 seconds where we were delighted to see her blasted into oblivion. She was quite muted without more than a few words in this film. I was quite tired of her annoying overacting and cackling. I never understood why she was allowed to get away with her overbearing absurdity in portraying that character. She was so carried away with herself that she actually punctured the eardrum of Neville in the Order of the Phoenix film with her wand in the scene preceeding the death of Sirius Black. The flying scene with Voldemort and Harry at the end of Hallows 2 was also downright absurd... bordering on clownish.

It also was a crying shame how the house elf ""Kreature"" had all of his good scenes completely eliminated from both final films. Not one scene where he turned around his attitude after receiving the fake horcrux as a gift.

Killing off both Remus and Tonks, Dumbledore (book 6), Snape and one of the Weasely twins by Rowlings was totally unnecessary and cruel... especially in a popular childrens book. It was downright insensitive and unnecessary.

But they have used the wrong actress for Ginny since the beginning. There was never any spark between their characters (Harry & Ginny) on the screen. She was actually better suited for Neville. Hermione also was not a good match with Ron Weasely either and the kiss in the chamber was ill timed. There was a better spark between Hermione and Harry on Deathly Hallows pt 1 and in the Half Blood prince when Harry consoled her during the Lavender episode. The makeup and costume depts  did a bad job on Luna. She barely looked like herself.

The dialogue and on-screen time for most of the supporting actors roles are almost nonexistent. Mr Weasely was only briefly in a couple scenes without any dialogue at all. If you blink your eyes, you will miss him. Every scene you can imagine has been rewritten by this mindless APE of a director and watered down into hastened, hacked apart, cheap snapshots. He did a worse hack job on this movie than he did in Half blood prince which was a travesty in the hands of this butcher. Remember how every scene from book 6 was filmed in yellow lighting? It was bad enough to see his destruction of the storyline... but the yellow hue to all the lighting in the Half Blood prince was simply awful and distorted every frame of that film. Yates has no business as a director... much less over the highest money grossing films of all time.

It was really sad to see the actors with their hearts not in their acting scenes on this final movie. Everything was flat and lifeless.

A dismal end to a fabulous series.

I am concerned about Emma Watson. In the previews on the DVD, she looked extremely skeletal and had cut off her hair like a boy. She looks quite severely anorexic. She may have a serious eating disorder. She looks like Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby who also looked exactly like this. I hope someone helps her before the eating disorder seriously damages her like the late Karen Carpenter.

As for the Ultra violet... avoid buying them if you can. It is like putting a vicious virus full of spyware to search and destroy files on your computer without your permission. Your antivirus software will not remove it as a friendly program. DON'T USE THE DISC IN YOUR COMPUTER. DON'T BUY ULTRAVIOLET IF THERE IS ANY OTHER CHOICE. You will have a heck of a time trying to remove all of the UV spyware and damaging files after using an ultraviolet disc. The only way to get rid of it unless you are a computer expert... would be to wipe the drive and reload the operating system from scratch... and that would destroy all your files if you were not careful to back them up. Unfortunately, they forced UV upon us this time... but it will be the last time and it will never be played on my computer. I can live without other non-potter movies if they insist on adding UV. I only made an exception on Harry Potter because there was no other way to get it on DVD...

Forget the blue-ray trash as well. It is only a scam to get more money out of you and force your media purchases under the control of one company who holds the patent. With a monopoly, this one company will control the prices as high as they dare as well as control your options on what you can buy since there will not be any competition. They want to get rid of all VHS which allowed you to copy free from TV and they want to get rid of inexpensive DVD's to ensnare all video consumers into their net... and by net I'm talking about a snare or trap not a network. Be sure to buy older DVD recorder models because they are trying to control what you record from TV now as well. The older models don't have these. This same type of maneuvering is going on with TIVO and DVR. They can actually delete things you record remotely... and have already done so. Just ask people who had copied Ventura's Conspiracy Theory episodes. The Crooks Ventura exposed in the episode about the water stealing scam raised heck so the DVR's from various vendors ALL did a mysterious upgrade which wiped out only those disputed episodes from that one series and none others... in every home across the country... except for those which had their remote access disconnected.

As a retired engineer, I worked with a lot of technologies like this and the plans they have for future uses. It would take volumes for me to list everything. Most of you are too young to understand the depth of greed and the control capabilities of these designers of new technologies. Your love of technology will end up eliminating your freedoms, your privacy and your collections. Everyone will end up losing a lot more than they bargained for from the blind love of technology which these entities will use to control everyone and everything. By the time anyone realizes what has happened it will be much too late. This has already happened in other industries which are now controlled by super corporations like Monsanto, Microsoft, GE, Onstar, etc.

Stick with plain DVD. The other format manufacturers can't change what they can't sell and the DVD's are quite inexpensive. If you don't buy these other formats, they will stop making them. They won't have a choice.

Remember... most people who defend these scam formats usually work for the manufacturer or dealer. They always yell the loudest because they are the ones who have something to lose. It is the honest people who try to warn you of the pitfalls... while the crooks defend it.",1321660800,2,9559,4.62286387743076

3818400,2,B001UV4XIS,"I pre-ordererd this months ago in great anticipation to see the final confrontation between Harry and Voldermort as written; in the great hall surrounded by Harry's friends, supporters and enemies alike.  This was the best, most uplifting chapter of the entire series.  With Voldermort's final death Harry is mobbed by friends, students, parents, teachers all in absolute joy.  I  can't imagine why this was rewritten for the movie.  Instead, the final showdown was an extended action sequence of the two alone, dueling without witnesses.  And when Harry emerges triumphant, there is no outpouring of joy and congratulations, only dejected faces.  We're not even sure anyone is aware that Voldermont is dead as it's never mentioned.  What a terrible disservice to J.K. Rowlands book.

I have no complaint in regard to the UltraViolet Digital Copy as I have no idea what that is but I felt terribly let down by the ending of the movie.  I'm at a complete loss as to why, when the rest of the movie followed the book somewhat well, the final showdown was rewritten to avoid the triumphant victory expressed so well in the book.

10 Years ago in 2001, I saw the first Harry Potter movie in theaters and was introduced to the magic and spirit of the magical world of Harry Potter. Now, today in 2011, I have the final Harry Potter film, thus completing a timeless saga with heart and wonderful memories.

This movie is FANTASTIC. Don't compare it to the book. This stands alone as a great movie and adaptation of J.K. Rowling's novel and serves as an explosive, thrilling, emotional end to the film series after a decade of great memorable moments and movie theater trips  with friends and family.

The acting has definitely improved over the last 10 years, especially with our main trio, featuring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. The supporting cast, such as Matthew Lewis as Neville and Alan Rickman as the tragic hero Severus Snape, has certainly improved as well and become more prominent and important to the movies  and developed story arc. Everybody gives their best towards the end of this fine journey, which is driven and carried with emotional scenes plus a great moving soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat.

Overall, this is truly one of the best movies of the 21st century, and ends a decade of traditions and adventure for millions of people. Even so, as the movies and books have all been released, we can relive the adventures of Harry Potter and never forget all the mischief managed.

Oh, and by the way, the Bluray/DVD combo pack is GREAT. I don't care if the Ultraviolet doesn't completely satisfy, it's the actual movie that matters (you can contact Flixster and redeem for an iTunes digital download anyway...).

3818407,5,B001UV4XIS,"The movie was an entertaining version of the book and easily held my attention all the way through; while it is somewhat dark and menacing it tells the story of Harry's final battle with Voldemort in an exciting fashion which will be enjoyable to watch repeatedly. The Epilogue, ""Nineteen Years Later"" is faithfully presented at the end of the movie as it is in the book. Both sound and picture are good and contribute to the telling of the story.

I've now watched all three discs and downloaded the movie to my computer and it all worked just fine. The download is a formidable 2 GB's and takes a few minutes on a cable connection but it downloaded and played back.

The download instructions tell you that Flixster and Adobe Air must be installed on your computer and automatically starts the process if those two programs aren't already on your computer. I didn't have either of them so I had to download and install them after which I downloaded the movie. The movie is now downloaded to my computer and plays back through the Flixster software; I've played the first few minutes and it seems to be going well.

When I first tried the Blu-ray disc my player (OPPO BDP83-SE) froze and wouldn't do anything; I had to cut the power to the player then restarted the player, ejected the disc and then reinserted it at which time it played perfectly. I have no idea why it froze the first time and played perfectly the second time. Since then I've played the DVD version and replayed the Blu-ray version as well as the Special Features disc all with no problem.

The movie is based on the book, not a movie version of the book; having said that I think the movie version has merit which can be enjoyed for what it is even though it varies from the book's version of the story. All of the key elements of the book's version are there but just packaged to get there by different routes. In her conversation with Daniel Radcliffe, J.K. Rowling makes some comments on the differences between her book version and the movie version; the movie's version of the story obviously had the author's apporval.

The Special Features disc included some excellent resources including a conversation between Daniel Radcliffe and J.K. Rowling. This conversation provides some fascinating background on the writing of the books and the making of the movies. If you have an interest in the franchise this is a conversation you don't want to miss; J.K. Rowing explains a lot of her thinking that was influential in the production of the movie and the writing of the stories.

Normally I don't download movies that I have on Blu-ray to my computer; in this case I made an exception because of the various comments from other reviewers. I was really curious how it would work out with Flixster and the downloaded version of the movie. So far so good; I'll set aside some time to watch the entire movie on my computer and if anything noteworthy occurs I'll update this review. One thing I did notice was when I stopped the movie and later went back to it the movie started again at the beginning, not the point where I stopped it.

On balance I think the movie is effective, powerful and even has some touching moments; those who appreciate the characters involved in the story will probably find the movie well worth their time.",1321574400,3,3305,4.620102214650767

The 1080p picture for the most part are clear and detailed. There are some smearing but those are in the background. The audio (DTS-HD 5.1) is fabulous: voice and sound are clean and clear, and sound effects have directional sense.

Haven't tried the ultra-violet, but I am totally against it and hated it. I prefer to have copy that sit on my PC server or my smart phone or iPad, playable locally without external connections.

If it wasn't for the combo pack (3D/DVD), I would just get the single one or complete collection. 3D is exclusive to Best Buy so I returned this to Amazon in favor of the 3D combo pack.",1321574400,4,851,4.622516556291391

My spouse bought this so not my dime, so to speak, but I was so ticked off I just went out to iTunes and bought the SD version outright. I also went out to their web site and told them off, the greedy jerks. Now I hear they are giving people iTunes copies because the reaction of many has been fast and furious. A PR blunder. I mean, they've made more money off this franchise than they know what to do with and it still isn't enough.

3818420,2,B001UV4XIS,"I have nothing to say about the movie. It is known masterpiece. So is the blu ray. However, that 'ultraviolet' digital copy is CRAP. I am saying this after trying everything. Digital copies previously given were so simple and easy to download and manage, but this one is a nightmare even for a cyber savvy guy. Here is my experience in detail for others to read. Hope it may save you some time.

1. Unless you type in the 'flixster' right, the webpage won't open. The spelling is FLIXSTER, not FLIXTER (the mistake many have inadvaertantly made)

2. Once you get on there, it will ask you to create TWO seperate accounts a) Flixster and b) Ultraviolet (my question is WHAT FOR? Why isn't the code sufficient?)

3. They will ask you to agree their terms and conditions so many times, you won't have any patience to read all of them, as you will be eager to see the movie. I don't know how to interpret it in terms of your protection legally.

4. After creating TWO seperate accounts, they will give you a box to type your code (you think 'finally!'? keep reading..), after that, you will go on another page to see options (stream now, dwnld to your pc, etc).

5. Even after this, they will ask you to install TWO applications (Flixster collections and Adobe Air, which, in turn is required for flixster collections to function normally....why can't flixster work by itself?).When you INSTALL the applications, MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE TICKS in front of the boxes that have some crappy services (flixster would like to send you some stupid notifications..etc..). Otherwise your inbox is surely gonna overflow!!!

6. N O W you did it! Congratulations! Click on the movie download page and be patient to wait further. You never know how long it will take for the movie to dwnld. I have a 12 Mbps download speed and it took me almost 30 min to complete this 2 GB movie (I have an HDTV connected to the same network and streaming HD movies has never been a problem to me). They cannot blame that the server was overwhelmed. I am downloading one week past its release!

7. THE CLIMAX: I played the movie (using flixster collections, NOT RealOne or iTunes). It plays well. However, when I look for the file in pc, I cannot find it! Then I Googled and found that they have an option in the 'flixster collections"". Follow this path- Collection > Add > select My Computer as location > Select directory > Check on box ""add to iTunes library"". Now it should show there, right? NOPE!
I have tried everything- Try loace the file, add it to multiple folders, multiple loactions, try adding it to iTunes through flixter collections (which kept failing all the time), Add the file/folder through iTunes menu. NOTHING WORKS.
Okay, the last option was to try playing it in RealOne/any other media player and then convert it to iPhone compatible files (which I did for hundreds of videos). THE FILE JUST WON'T PLAY IN ANY MEDIA PLAYER!!! WHAT RUBBISH? I see the 2 GB file sitting in 'video' folder (The file name is ""ADS_UV_HarryPotter7P2_main_FAXS_2000k_dl""), but I CANNOT PLAY IT IN ANYTHING BUT Flixster collections! FORGET ADDING IT TO iTunes!

In total, I spent 3 relentless hrs to get to my digital copy only to get frustrated. I didn't get this frustrated even while installing any software or recovering my pc. This is not just crap but a huge scam to promote flixster collections (I never heard of that media player before, though I have flixster app on iPnone). It is still OK to promote new things, but not at this cost. They are luring us by saying that you can stream anytime anywhere, but they don't deliver the simplest and the most basic stuff. Plus, when we have an option of renting an HD movie straight from Amazon and other internet video services, who wants to see this crap on their Google TV? FLixster and Warner, FIRST MAKE IT PLAY ON MY iTunes and then make promises.
It is clear that this has been a huge deal for Warner Home Video, who have cashed every single dime from Harry Potter series (which is fine for me), but this is nonsense and torture for the fans.  So, go for it if you are ready to spend enough time only to see a downloaded copy of the movie. Forget about adding it to your iPod. I wrote all this only to let others know what is in store for them. BOO the ultraviolet copy. If you think all these efforts are worth for downloading ONE digital copy, you are welcome to the show!
Also, if anyone finds a way to nail it, please let me know. I will be happy to correct my mistakes (if there are any). Good luck and thanks for reading.",1321488000,7,4553,4.515776699029126

Here is their letter.

[Dear Kenny:

Thank you for being one of our best customers and among the first to try UltraViolet(tm) (UV) Digital Copy.

While we have received a lot of positive reaction to UltraViolet, we realize that with any new technology there is a learning curve for both creators and consumers, and this is especially true around new user experiences.

It's important to us that you are fully satisfied with your purchase. We are issuing you an an iTunes code for your movie so that you can obtain an iOS-compatible download of this title immediately.

******************

To redeem your code, please follow these instructions:

1. Open iTunes.
2. Navigate to the iTunes Store.
3. Locate the ""Redeem"" link in the right side of the Storefront in the Quick Links panel.
4. Enter your Authorization Code.
5. If the files do not show up in your Download queue, click ""Store"" > ""Check for Available Downloads""]

What positive reactions? Everyone hates this service. I don't like there terms of service and I don't like that the movie studios control it and can revoke the title at any time without warning. Ultraviolet is out of sync with the rest of technology.",1321488000,8,1594,4.667857142857143

Then I go online and see that nobody's really happy with ""Ultraviolet"".  That outta teach me to look up reviews of new technology before I buy it. The BluRay works fine. But I have no idea how Ultraviolet will work, since I can't even register for an account!!!!

3818424,5,B001UV4XIS,"Having read the books, I was pleased that the movies remained true to the essence of the books.  Where Part One of the final episode was at the very least depressing (although still very well written, acted and performed), Part Two was an action adventure and possibly the most mature of all the films.  As I recall, much like the books, the movies became more adult oriented as the principles grew up in each successive movie.  The Series was more or less a celebration not only of Harry Potter as the focal point and hero of the story but was also a testimony to the fact that the females in the films (Hermione, Ginny Weasley, Lana and even Molly Weasley - Ron's mother) were strong role models for the independent woman(something that J.K. Rowling was aiming for). I was somewhat concerned about the ending in the movie and was not expecting it to follow the book's ending but was pleasantly surprised that it was done quite well and again matched that of the book. After 10 years of watching these young people grow from being children to adulthood, it is sad to think that this is the last of its kind. At least I have all of the movies in my library and can enjoy watching Harry, Ron and Hermione grow up and save the Wizarding World again and again. I have the BluRay/DVD/Ultraviolet Digital Copy and since I do not load digital copies onto my PC I would not have loaded the Ultraviolet copy anyway.  Nevertheless, it is extremely disturbing and disappointing that the movie industry like others are trying to take advantage of consumers to make a few extra dollars.

I really liked this final installment in the Harry Potter series. It has been a lengthy road, but seeing it to the end felt rewarding somehow. I felt that the previous installment was actually the weakest of the movies, and was hoping this would be a solid conclusion. For me, it worked perfectly. That's not to say there weren't some flaws in the filming...there were. Some of the battles were kind of hard to follow visually, and the very, very end was a little difficult. I feel they should have done a little better with the make-up, or gotten a different lot of actors for the last two or three minutes. That aside, it was kind of back to Potter basics. A continuation of the theme with a quest at hand, a discovery of unheralded bravery, disclosure of the finer plot details, and a final confrontation, with some surrealist moments mixed in to change the pace and further the plot.
I see this movie wasn't well received in the reviews here, but i enjoyed the movie and thought it was an almost perfect closure of the series. Of course, i haven't read the books, so i cant speak to the authenticity of the story line per se, but for a person who hasn't read them, i was impressed.

3818451,5,B001UV4XIS,"SPOILERS POSSIBLE:

This movie (and the book) were an incredible wrap up to an incredible series.  Adults and children alike are touched by and wrapped up in these stories; my husband is by no means a voracious reader (he reads a couple of books a year) but he has read all of these books multiple times and he has almost an encyclopedic knowledge of the world Rowling has created.  And it is just that; a world - the creativity with which she crafts her characters and the landscape and plot around them is almost unparalleled.  I do not think it is excessive praise to compare her stories to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

In particular one cannot praise her characters too highly.  Her heroes are truly heroic, and there can be few villains in history that can rival Voldemorte.  However, perhaps her best character of all turns out to be Severus Snape.  The depth of the character she creates in Snape, not just in this story but throughout the series, is almost unparalleled.  Snape's story is incredibly complex and she does such an excellent job of hiding the truth until the end.  She manages to take a character that many probably loathed for many years and turn him into almost as much of a hero as the main character(s), which is impressive.

I also have to give her kudos for her choices in how to resolve the story; I thought she had just the right amount of carnage, for lack of a better way to put it.  I was afraid she would ""cop out"" and not kill any important characters, and I was happy (from a literary perspective) to see that she made the hard choices.  It would not have had the same impact had she chosen to avoid killing any characters we cared about.  In the same vein, I am so glad she had an epilogue; it set just the right tone to get across the message of hope.  As someone else said, it reminds us what was worth fighting for.

As for the movie specifically, I thought it was excellent.  The special effects were excellent, as always.  I thought the cast and crew did a phenomenal job on this movie in particular.  I was especially impressed with how well the director (I assume he should get the credit) melded the scenes to show us how Harry and Voldermorte were two sides of the same coin.  He did an excellent job of highlighting just how connected the two were.  The suspense was excellent, as was the way the story flowed.  I have heard complaints about the way the movie started off with action immediately, but honestly Part I and Part II were meant to be treated almost as one movie with an Interlude - if you haven't watched Part I you really need to watch it before this one.  Definitely an excellent wrap up to the series.  Highly recommend.",1321401600,,2685,4.4215885947046845

Anyway, I watched the Deathly Hallows, part 2 and it was amazing. Masterful way of combining the best moments from the book into a breath-taking, emotional, nail-biting roller-coaster of a movie. Very well made - even though I have read the book close to 5 times and knew what would happen, the movie still kept me at the edge of my seat. Neville didn't disappoint, Ron was OK, too bad Bellatrix didn't have more screen time, Snape was great as always.

I wonder if WB gave up on the codes in exchange for giving iTunes extras? Maybe I'll have to shell out an extra $15 for a decent digital copy?
I've been sitting here for over an hour trying to get a proper download and nothing has worked. Frankly, I find this all very off putting. I feel like the only thing that I've gotten out of this is a hard copy of the movie in both blue-ray and standard. WB, if you're listening, knock it off and just give me my iTunes code for this movie. Things go much more smoothly when you keep it simple. Just skip the hassle and don't bother with the three disc.

But, Disney is working on it's own streaming service called ""Keychest"". To be determined if that will play nice with iTunes or not.

In a world where easier and faster is the focus, this is a step in the complete wrong direction. To use UltraViolet, you first have to create an Ultraviolet account. You then have to create a Flixster account. You then have to either stream the movie in an internet browser or install the Flixster app on your portable device.

The only special feature on this DVD is a collection of deleted scenes. To get the 3 featurettes, you have to buy the iTunes version (or, I think the Blu-ray).

The deleted scenes are good. In fact, some of them are better than we've gotten since way back in the early HP movies. In my opinion, 2 or 3 of them should have stayed in the final cut. There are some good moments that fill in the story a bit. (One of my complaints is the length and pace of this last movie.) There are also a few brief scenes that still have green screens, which gives an interesting glimpse into what was and was not real on set. And there is a cute scene where Hermione gets a very fun line.

3818476,4,B001UV4XIS,"Joanne Rowling's compelling, addictive adventure of the boy wizard has been officially translated into about 70 languages.  Each movie adapted from the seven books made about a billion bucks (excluding home video).  Total gross for home video and books has been estimated at an additional $10 billion - give or take a few million.  Today, Ms. Rowling is among the richest woman in the UK.  But that was not always so.

When she began writing, she was essentially out of work and broke.  But during a delay on a train from Manchester to London, she said that a story fully formed percolated and spilled out on scribbled napkin notes.  And it continued to flow and flow and flow.  By luck, an obscure literary agent plucked her unsolicited manuscript from a pile and immediately was transported into the world of the story.  That first volume made publishing history - as did those that followed.  Meticulous film adaptations with detailed production design and remarkable casting, directing acting, music and effects reflected the reading experience.

Much has been written about this pop-culture phenomenon, but perhaps the main attraction is the coming of age in a world of good and evil and danger and responsibility where fear and desire rub up against each other.  Somehow we all know that just beyond the ordinary and mundane are extraordinary wonders and mysteries and this massive tale latches onto that core theme.

In some conservative circles, the books and movies were denounced as fostering in vulnerable young readers an unhealthy interest in dark, supernatural powers.

The publisher, fearing young boys would be put off by a female author, used only her initials to mask her gender.  She also kept quiet about her own embrace of Christianity.

With the release of the last half of ""Deathly Hallows,"" the entire story can now be enjoyed in a thrilling, magical marathon viewing extravaganza.

Beautifully acted, the final showdown is a dazzling and satisfying conclusion to the epic drama of warring good and evil and the role of human responsibility.

Not too much can be said about the perfect casting of young Daniel Radlciffe as Potter.  He not only matches the book cover art but also the essence of the character as portrayed on the novels' pages.  Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are similarly perfect as Potter's Hogwarts' mates.  But what's most amazing to witness, especially at one sitting, is the actual coming of age of these terrific young actors.  The stakes are very high indeed and there is no guarantee of safety for anyone when Harry is faced with the ultimate sacrifice as he makes a final stand against Lord Valdemort.  The extras on the superbly Blu-ray disc are generous.  I especially enjoyed the ""Conversation with J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe"" and ""The Goblins of Gringotts.""

3818478,5,B001UV4XIS,"Okay, the movie in itself is great. What isn't? Ultraviolet, at least the way it is right now. People seem to think that it's a scam and that's because the way the company presents it. Its confusing because it seems like they are only allowing the purchaser to stream and download for three years and thats it. Far from the truth. The three years is only for the streaming and here is why: you will be streaming from Ultraviolet/Flixster, just like Netflix users stream from Netflix, and, like Netflix, Ultraviolet has to pay for bandwidth, you will have to use data plan if you are streaming from your phone or pad but that's your deal, unless of course you are using wifi. So they are letting purchasers stream the movie at no extra charge. After that, if you still want streaming they will charge an extra fee because of the bandwidth. When you stream it takes up no space on your hard drive so that is an advantage, but the space must be taken up somewhere, hence bandwidth. So the streaming is for three years, not the download.

The download portion is for you to keep, forever. Once you download it you will be able put it on a flash drive or burn it to a disc and play it up to 12 computers at a time. Yes, it involves the flixster collection app, which is free. Flixster now allows people with smartphone and the ability to download the Flixster app to stream AND download their digital copy to their smartphones, making that advantageous over iTunes and Amazon because only people with an iPod touch, iPhone, or Android (and other smartphones with the ability to use amazon or iTunes) could play their digital copy anywhere. Now  other smartphones can as well. The other advantage is that the memory space isn't as much on a smartphone, because the space needed on a phone or touch is smaller than a computer. So the download is yours forever.

In your ultraviolet account you can have more than one person on your account. No need to ""authorize"" a computer anymore. Ultraviolet also uses a cloud and, unlike Apple, the cloud has your digital copy, so if anything goes wrong you don't have to worry, well there has been some issues as I have read so hopefully those issues get fixed. iTunes does not have your digital copy in their cloud, and I know because I am constantly worried that I would lose them. I almost did once and iTunes did nothing to help me, luckily it was in my iPod's memory.

I purchased the 3D versions from Best Buy, Part 1's 3D transfer is not great but it does give it a different feel and I like it, when I looked at the ultraviolet I was skeptical. I already had the Green Lantern and I was frustrated with the change, I had problems with starting an account etc. etc., but the problem finally got fixed a day or two later. I RESEARCHED the intentions of Ultraviolet and now I am sold. However, sadly people don't like change. Please take a moment to research before you get all these ideas that it's trying to make things harder for the buyer. The only two things ultraviolet did wrong was not make themselves much clearer and there is no capability to remove movies from your smartphone other than deleting the app but that will delete your entire collection and you would have to download them again. I believe that Ultraviolet is better than iTunes or amazon. Well, at least it would be better for not the word of mouth. So try it and read before you judge.

I like digital copies for one reason. So I can watch movies when I travel. You know, like on a plane, where I don't have an internet connection. Or in places where I don't have access to a wifi hot spot but don't want to waste my limited data allotment.

No, to me a digital copy is a copy you actually have ON YOUR COMPUTER OR DEVICE. One that you can watch anywhere. Despite that in the description they say that Ultraviolet can be watched anywhere that isn't true. It can only be watched anywhere you have access to the internet. On a plane without internet service? Out of luck. Don't have 3G on your tablet and not near a hotspot? Out of luck. Out of data on your dataplan for the month? Out of luck.

3818490,3,B001UV4XIS,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

Not counting shallow effects, 18 out of screen effects extend 5% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 6 made it out to 10%. 3 OOS effects extended to 20%. My favorite is a dragon's head snapping its mouth closed at about 21:00 minutes.

The quality of the in screen 3D is real good for a post-production (FAKE) 3D film. But it should be, they spent a small fortune having IMAX oversee 12 companies doing the 2D to 3D conversion process. However, as with all converted 3D films there are minor flaws and the cardboard cutout effect. This film also had over done 3D in at least 5 scenes and 5 more easily visible 3D flaws.

I hope this (the ultimate effort of conversion) finally convinces the 3D industry to just use a 3D camera setup when shooting. They could have had an excellent film instead of one in the middle of the pack.

*** Three and a half stars ***

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

Nope.

Ultraviolet requires you to download a program from Flickster (and Adobe Air if you don't have it installed) AND create an account on the site.  Only once you've done this can you download your movie -- into their special application.

The Deathly Hallows part 2 had some great moments, but it lacked important information for those fans who haven't read the series, which I highly recommend doing.

SPOILER ALERT:

GREAT:
1. Snape's death scene in the movie was handled well. After reading that scene in the book, I thought it was going to be cheesy on film - although I didn't understand why they were in a boathouse instead of the Shrieking Shack.
2. Helena Bonham Carter acting as Hermione disguised as Bellatrix by way of poly juice potion. Her work on that role should be a winner for best supporting actress.
3. Inclusion of the Prince's Tale (Snape's story), which was basically, the whole reason why Harry Potter was the boy who lived, and the one who could defeat Voldemort.

LACKING:
1. Explanation of the Deathly Hallows - Harry was in possession of all three - the Elder Wand for having won it from Draco, the resurrection stone - gave no background on where it originally came from (Voldemort's family), and the invisibility cloak, which Harry had inherited from his father, but the movie didn't even hint that HIS cloak was THE cloak. Also, since he owned all 3 deathly hallows, he was invincible, and thus escaped death. I'm not so sure that anyone watching only the movie would even understand how Harry came back to life.
2. Explanation of the last horcruxes: the goblet in the bank belonged to Helga Hufflepuff - no mention whatsoever of that rather important detail, which leads to Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem possibly being a horcrux. The snake being a horcrux - didn't show how Voldemort came into possession of the snake and why it was chosen.
3. Why Molly Weasley was at Hogwart's.
4. Snape and Minerva's duel was rather boring - Snape was chased off by 3 wizards in the book.
5. Too much screen time for the gray lady without even telling her story.
6. Draco's companion, Vincent Crabbe, in the room of requirement. Maggie Smith was battling breast cancer and managed to play Minerva, but Jamie Waylett couldn't get his act together.
7. Dumbledore's story and how he himself had sought possession of the deathly hallows. The movie shows his brother and sister, but doesn't explain why she's a child or why his brother harbors resentment.
8. AND THE BIGGEST - After Harry kills Voldemort, NO ONE seems to notice. They're just sitting around chitchatting with each other as though they're waiting for the director to shout, ""Action!"" Um, hello, Voldemort is gone forever. Doesn't anyone care? No cheers. No acknowledgement. No pat on the back.

Some other lacking items are also lacking from the book itself. How some of the characters were killed wasn't discussed in the book either, because everything is from Harry's perspective. He didn't witness most of the battle, because his duty was to destroy the horcruxes, so I won't blame the screenplay on that.

All in all, it's still entertaining and worth seeing, especially if you've seen all of the previous movies. Don't watch it if you've missed some of them, because you'll be lost as to what's going on.

As a side note: If anyone has a way of getting in touch with Rowling, here's an idea- a prequel TV series, ""Hogwarts: The Marauders Years."" I'm aware Rowling doesn't want to write a prequel, but maybe she'd be open to leaving the actual writing to others, who simply follow her guidelines.

Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.

You are stuck playing the digital copy on your PC/MAC or streaming it on a portable device. Yep, streaming it. The only way to watch your digital copy on an iPhone or Droid device is via streaming. So no internet access means no movie on a portable device. The Flixster concept is just stupid.

Any digital copy that says, ""Ultraviolet"" cannot currently be played on any Apple device or any other portable media player either. This is not explained anywhere in the item description. Flixster claims to be working on the issue. Just FYI, when I complained to Flixster about the digital download joke, they sent me an iTunes redemption code for the same movie, which I thought was excellent customer service.

As for the Special Features of this combo pack, they are a joke. I guess I should not have expected more than 10 minutes of special features worth watching. No one wants to listen to JK Rowling promote her new website, listen to Daniel Radcliffe or Emma Watson deliver an interview for 30 minutes. People want extra footage (there is a little bit of that), behind the scenes footage, and more on how the world of Harry Potter was created.

I would not have bought this knowing the ""ultraviolet"" digital copy process.

3818541,1,B001UV4XIS,"The movie was well executed, followed the story line of the books and wrapped up the series with a bang. The acting and directing and digital effects are leaps and bounds above where it began with the Sorcerers Stone. That being said, I'm giving the studio a big F for distributing the ""digital copy"" they way they did. Rather than go with the industry standard iTunes download, they are going with a new scheme that someone in Hollywood has come up with. Since I couldn't easily send the movie back(opened shrinkwrap), I thought I'd give the Ultraviolet system a shot, and found it lacking.

The first problem I see is privacy issues that go along with yet another system for managing media. I have a large distrust for companies ability to keep the data safe, not that I think that they have much interest in my entertainment preferences, beyond selling me more. I have rather serious reservations about being forced to sign an agreement that allows them to make changes to it without my knowledge(which most of these license agreements state). As the current market leader, Apple's business is big enough, and they are smart enough to realize that they would loose millions if they were breached. That fact makes me believe they will stop at nothing to protect that information. A startup competitor might cut corners in order to get a new system up and running.

The next issue is how long it took to wade through the setup process. In my case, with a new laptop, wideband internet and a fairly well developed technical ability, it was over an hour from start to finish. Granted, much of that time would not be an issue if I were predisposed to utilizing the system again. What follows is the process...
Setup Flixster account with password
Agree to Flixster's terms of service, privacy rules
Setup Ultraviolet account with password
Agree to Ultraviolet terms of service and privacy rules
Download and install Flixster Collections application
Download and install Adobe Air
Agree to Adobe Air Licensing agreement
Agree to Flixter's End User Agreement(which couldn't be completely viewed or printed!)
Enter in the code in the BluRay box.
Download the movie

The deal breaker for me was the lack of iPod transfer. I like to have the movies available for the kids to watch in the car, and there is no way that I could find to transfer this type of digital copy to an iPod. Any sort of digital copy has to have this option for me, or else it looses significant value.

All in all, I understand that the movie studios want to keep the profits of distribution, instead of giving them to Apple, but in order to get me to switch, they are going to need to make the process easier and provide iPod access as well.

 - during the scene where Harry is talking to the Goblin & Ollivander.  Didn't he get into an argument with the Goblin over the legitimate claim that the sword is owned by wizards?  and didn't he ask Ollivander about whether his wand could be fixed?

 - during the scene where Harry is walking to his death, didn't he come across Neville and tell him he needed to kill the snake?

 - during the flashback, didn't his mother have a confrontation with Petunia about her trying to write to Dumbldore to get into the school?  And wasn't she nasty to her on the train platform?

 - during the same flashback, didn't Lily confront Snape about his dark friendships?  and didn't we see Voldemort also kill James before he killed Lily?

3818548,1,B001UV4XIS,"First, know that I'm giving this 1 star because of the horrible issues with the digital copy. It would have been better to not even include this in the package than to include this stupid convoluted ordeal with flixster and ultraviolet. Know that the digital copy that comes with this is not a copy available through iTunes. You have to register with flixster and ultraviolet to view the digital copy and only after you install their programs or apps on your computer or device. And to make matters worse, the default method flixster uses to have you login is by connecting your facebook account. Do you really want a business having access to something personal of yours that they have nothing to do with (of course, facebook is a business and they have access to your personal account, but that's different)? Plus, the flixster/ultraviolet duo does not allow the digital copy to be downloaded on older, but still functional devices, like my 2nd generation iPod. So long, flixster and ultraviolet. I don't think there is another option to buy this with a different digital copy, so this is to help those future buyers have the right expectation - the digital copy with this is not like previous digital copies that have come with other blu-ray combos - next time I see ""ultraviolet digital copy"" I will know what that means and not expect it to deliver results, nor plan on letting ""digital copy"" be a selling point for a movie.

The movie is amazing, its not as good as the books, but it never is.  The movies tell a slightly different story, not necessarily worse, but different, and that's OK.

3818550,1,B001UV4XIS,"Watched the ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2"" Blu Ray (Blu Ray + DVD + ""Digital Copy"" release) on my Sony BDP-S570 and noticed a host of glitches with the video- there were numerous split-second skips that seem to be evenly spaced time-wise throughout the movie's run-time. I stopped and reloaded it a few times- the errors occurred at exactly the same moments each time...

The disc surface is immaculate- I don't have another BD player to give it a whirl in but have watched ""Captain America: First Avenger"", ""X-Men: First Class"" and ""Bridesmaids"" since then and had ZERO issues.

It appears some players are having trouble with the underlying ""Maximum Movie Mode""- you don't have to actually be playing the movie in MMM to be experiencing problems. I selected MMM and realized that the issues I had with the film/video coincided with the exact points in which the MMM features kick into gear under that app. In short- they've crammed too much ""junk"" onto one disc without proper QC.

This is NOT a player issue- I'm not updating firmware (and possibly junking up the player for good) for one Blu Ray title out of the last 30 it's played.

Of course, as soon as I realized what this flixster crap was - I immediately removed it from my computer.

So if you've already purchased the DVD, do NOT download flixster and use the ultra-violet crap - but instead google ""hand brake"" and download it for your computer. Create your own ""digital copy"". :)",1321056000,6,1048,4.314720812182741
3818556,1,B001UV4XIS,"UPDATE: I followed the advice of many Amazon posters and contacted Flixster again. I gave them my redemption code, and they sent me a code for an iTunes digital copy, which I have downloaded. :o)

I love getting a digital copy of my movies, along with the DVD, so then I can watch a movie on my iPod, or my computer, or my tv. I bought this edition of HP7p2 at Target because I'm a HP nut and wanted it TODAY! :o) I was skeptical of the UltraViolet copy, since I'd never heard of it before, and I wasn't excited to use it at all when I read the back of the DVD case and found out I'd have to create not just one, but two new accounts and usernames and passwords to both UltraViolet and Flixster. However, that seemed to be the only digital copy combo available at the store, so I bought it.

Too bad I didn't do my homework online first.

I followed the instructions to sign up for Flixster and UltraViolet. In theory, the concept behind UltraViolet looks promising: any six users can access any one account from any device, streaming the movies as they wish, plus you can have a certain number of ""hard"" downloads to actual computers/devices. Cool, eh?

I downloaded and installed Flixster Collections, their software for viewing their movies on your computer. It has a really odd interface that makes you scroll horizontally, which is super annoying, but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, I went about downloading the movie to my computer, and I was surprised when it said Download Complete! after about 2 seconds. Really?

The file that was downloaded was 1 byte large, so obviously something went wrong. I deleted the file and tried again, with the same result. I wondered if maybe the movie didn't download really until the first time I tried to watch it (which I know makes no sense, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong), so I pressed play from within Flixster Collections. Predictably, the movie didn't load, and I was left watching a progress circle spin around on itself forever and ever.

Flixster's help section of their website is a joke, and the troubleshooting team, who did respond quickly to my problem ""ticket"", didn't really help either (they suggested deleting the file and re-downloading it... yeah, did that). I declared the downloaded copy of HP7p2 a flop.

But there was still the copy I can download to my smartphone, so I downloaded that. It was something like 600+MB, so I used a large portion of my  monthly 5GB data plan to download it (I access all my web use through my data plan, so a file that big is significant). Can you guess what happened once it finally finished downloading? That's right, it didn't work. I restarted my phone and tried again, but it still didn't work. I don't know why, it just tried to start and then said it couldn't. It wouldn't work.

So I tried to stream the video on my phone. That didn't work either. I have a MyTouch 4G, running on Gingerbread, so it's not like I'm working on some weak tiny smartphone--this phone is quite capable, but no go on the streaming.

There was one option left for accessing my digital copy of HP7p2: streaming online from my computer. I logged on and clicked to watch the movie. It buffered... and buffered... and buffered. And then it started. Alas, the film was grainy and pixelated. It might have looked nice on a 2-inch screen, but it looked horrible on my laptop.

Pathetic. All I wanted was a digital copy of Harry Potter to watch on my iPod or computer when I'm not plugged in to the internet. Now, not only do I NOT have a digital copy of HP7p2, I also have a huge portion of my monthly data plan wasted, and I have a DVD/Blu-Ray combo I can't return to Target because it's been opened. The only thing I can do is to warn other people: DON'T BUY THE ULTRAVIOLET MOVIE. Go to iTunes and buy a digital copy there; that's what I'm going to do. I'll never buy another movie associated with Flixster or UltraViolet again.",1321056000,7,3925,4.506329113924051

3818558,3,B001UV4XIS,"Let me be clear from the beginning. This is a review of the movie itself, not the discs or packaging like other reviews are here. That said, I decided to give this movie 3 stars based on an overall review of the movie. This is coming from someone that is a diehard Harry Potter fan, has the HB & PB of all seven books, all the movies and numerous other HP books. I stand by my overall praising of the whole of the HP world. And this movie is no different, I have seen far worse movies. In my opinion, the only thing that saved this movie from earning a one-star review, were the spectacular special effects and the absolutely amazing acting chops of certain actors. You know those types of actors. The ones who are the only thing saving a movie from being a complete bomb and bloody horror. Those types of actors being: Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and so on. The special effects were exactly what one would expect in a movie of this magnitude. And taking into account even though the last book WAS split into two seperate movies, massive ammounts of the book could not be included in the movie based on the obvious time issue. But what was included was either done very poorly or was raped and changed so drastically it barely resembled the original. For example: Snape's death and Harry's viewing of Snape's memories in the pensieve in Dumbledore's office. I almost threw up in my mouth it was so disgusting.

Overall, the writing and forming of the movie's contents vs the book = 1.5 stars.
The special effects and acting of most of the cast = 4 stars.
In short, watch or buy the movie, just don't expect it to stand up to the other HP movies.",1321056000,2,1709,4.442675159235669

When they included ultraviolet on Green Lantern which all ready had bad reviews, any hope of giving that movie a second chance on blu-ray or DVD ended once people saw how bad Ultraviolet was.

Im rating this release 1 star to send another clear message to the studio don't fix it if its not broken. Those of us that have iPads and iPhones that have been accustomed to having our digital copies a certain way are getting screwed because of Warner Brothers can't take the fact that Apple and iTunes are the standard for digital copy.

Do some research for unbiased information on Ultraviolet - if you can find unbiased info. :)

Ultraviolet is being launched in two phases. It's brand new, the first step is streaming only. Once phase two is implemented (I think spring 2012) the downloadable portion of it will start working.

So, for now - Ultraviolet is basically useless. You have the disc, and most of the time streaming for a portable device is impractical. However, starting next year, your movie will suddenly become download-able, and transferable between up to 12 devices.

Ultraviolet is the next big thing coming from the movie business.  There will be some amount of 'warring' between KeyChest (Apple/Disney) and Ultraviolet. The big question now is whether this will ever work on the ubiquitous iDevices.

Congratulations to her.

My big disappointment is with the studio not the movie itself.  WB released another form of UltraViolet years ago - a downloadable movie that stayed on your computer...if I'm home why would I watch a movie on my computer? If I can't put it on my iPod classic what's the point?  The web-site is difficult; I am still having problems with my account which they have failed to help me resolve.

The battle scene (essentially 3/4 of the movie) missed EVERY opportunity to bring tremendous scenes to life.  Attack of the spiders?  Missing.  Death of Fred ?  MIA.  Molly Weasley's duel after Bellatrix was easily holding off three people ?  10 seconds.  The battle of Harry and Voldemort in front of the entire armies ?  Not important, apparently -- we get some sort of flying around in a smoke trail.  Voldemort attacking because he realizes Harry is the master of the Elder Wand ?  Oh, was that in the book ?  Harry's other son in the ""19 years later"" scene ?  Oh, did he have two ?

This series seriously left the rails in movie 5 and since then has often fallen victim to ""director's vision"".  This movie, unforunately, is afflicted with the same problem.

The UltraViolet digital copy made me download 2 new apps onto my PC, accept terms 3 separate times, and then it took me half the night to download everything.

I just got this blu-ray today, and as usual, when I saw the word digital copy, I fired up iTunes, punched in the code for it to download the digital copy. iTunes doesn't recognize the code provided in this blu-ray. Apparently WB has decided to not support devices with the largest market share and went with its own ""digital copy.""

To get started, you have to sign up for a Flixster account, then sign up for an Ultraviolet account, then link them together. Are you still with me? Then punch in the code on the website and the movie will show up on your ""digital locker."" How do you watch the movie then? Well, there's a download button, but clicking that will reveal that you have to download and install an Adobe Air app for your computer. Yes, it doesn't support iTunes nor Apple TV. The website shows that it supports iDevices, which is misleading. iDevices are not supported natively. You have to download the flixster app for iOS, and stream the movie via that app, not via the built-in video player.

Now, who would want to go through all that just to watch the movie that you already paid for on your own devices? It's easier to just rip the DVD and make your own real digital copy, free from any hassles. This Ultraviolet method is a complete mess, and only confuses and punishes legitimate users. On the Ultraviolet website, they said there will be official Ultraviolet devices coming soon. Yeah, we'll see when that's going to happen.

UPDATE:
I moved up my ratings from 1 star to 3. If you go to flixster support: support dot ultraviolet dot flixster dot com, request a support ticket explaining nicely how you cannot use this ultraviolet copy with iTunes, you will receive a quick response from WB that will give you an iTunes code (make sure you have your original UV redemption code). Now, don't bother asking support directly from ultraviolet (uvvu dot com), they will simply said it is what it is and ignored your plea. So, added 2 stars for prompt response from flixster and WB, and now I have an iTunes digital copy.

UPDATE 2:
I moved the rating up to 4 stars. The iTunes code I obtained gave me the movie PLUS the iTunes extras! iTunes extras are bonus contents that you would get when you purchased the movie directly from iTunes. Usually on previous iTunes digital copy you get from purchasing blu-ray movies only get you the movie itself, not the iTunes extras.

Warner Brothers is paired with the legalized scam ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy,"" which is only usable by streaming your movie through flixster.com.  The say that you can download a copy to your computer, but there is some arbitrary date in the future that you have to wait for before the download option is available. . .

For those of you that want to try it anyway. . . . the iPhone flixster app seems to be able to stream when you have a high speed wifi available.  I am still currently unable to test on my Toshiba Thrive as the flixster app does NOT support Android Honeycomb 3.1 or above at this time. .FAIL!

3818652,1,B001UV4XIS,"UPDATED with a correction and an acknowledgment:

Correction: As many others have noted, while WB/UV/Flixter did a much-less-than-stellar job explaining it (as subsequent how-to explanations and videos attest), you can download a movie from Ultraviolet for offline viewing.  You just have to install 3 different applications (two on your computer, one on your i-device), and create 2 new user accounts along the way. Oh, and the downloads take forever (mine took something like 15 minutes just to start!).  But, ultimately, you can get a download to your computer, and presumably--I haven't tried--get it to a handheld or tablet for watching offline.  Of course, this means you'll have movies outside your primary collection; but, that's WB's goal. (And yes, I know WB/UV/Flixster wants you to import all your videos into their system).  Having made this correction, I should also raise another issue embedded in the ""fine print"" of the WB/UV/Flixster mess: you only own the digital download as long as you keep your account.  So, after all the trouble of downloading ""your"" digital copy, it turns out it's not really your copy at all!  It's really more like a long-term license for only so long as you keep the service; cancel your account, bye-bye movie.

Acknowledgment: WB/UV/Flixster has been issuing iTunes codes to download the movie from Apple.  Ironic?  Yep.  See many other reviews for the how-to-do-it, but in short, file a complaint with Flixster.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: HP7.2 is, of course, fantastic; it deserves everything good said about it.  Ultraviolet, however, is vomitously bad.  I'm actually not just annoyed, I'm angry at this ill-conceived, consumer-hostile sham, packaged as a ""digital copy"".  I'm amazed at what a crappy bait and switch Warner Bros perpetrated on us after the previous editions had the expected personal download (i.e., that you could actually put into iTunes or whatever viewer you like).  If I could return the opened movie, I would in half a heart-beat.  As other reviews note, Ultraviolet is not a download--it's a service that streams the movie to your device. I can't begin to tell you how annoying that is for so many reasons.  Of course, the most obvious: how, precisely, can I watch this on a plane, or anywhere else where bandwidth is bad or missing?  In other words, how exactly can I use the digital copy in any setting where I'd actually WANT to use it?  If you want the Blu-ray version it, just buy that version without the download; if you primarily want the download, head to iTunes or somewhere else.  Other reviewers are saying the UK version will have an actual download.  Whatever route you go, just DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION if you expect your own download.

You will be directed to an APP on iTunes that will facilitate streaming through Flixster, but NO DIGITAL COPY!

I have happily used digital copies in the past, making it possible to watch the movies conveniently on my iPad or through my Apple TV without needing to put in the blu-ray disc or DVD.  This one was a real pain.  The digital copy steps were first, go to a special website; second, download their special software (and don't forget to read the terms and conditions, over a hundred small screens worth).  Install their software and use it to download the movie.  Then you can ""watch the movie!""

Well, according to QuickTime it uses an unknown codec.  iTunes won't let me copy it in.  VLC player plays it, but without any video or sound...the ONLY way to watch it appears to be using their software.

Why can't I use the digital copy as, well, a digital copy?  I actually paid extra to get the digital copy and it is useless.  Worse than useless...I wasted a lot of time on it.  And when I checked the info on the file, it was 640x360 -- when my AppleTV is 1280x720.  So even if I were to find a way to play it, it would be lower resolution than I'm used to.  Basically, I've learned that Ultraviolet Digital Copy means don't bother.

The emotion that the actors showed during the last battle was amazing.  The viewer can really see how much the characters cared about each other.

I have purchased each of the HP movies and watch them pretty regularly.  But the release of the last movie with an ""Ultraviolet"" digital copy that doesn't support iTunes really put me off - why now?  I was really tempted to just download the iTunes version but it wasn't in HD and for the HP movies, I like the ability to put it in my Blu-Ray player sometimes.......

I researched it and purchased my Blu-Ray ""Triple Pack"" from Amazon UK, doesn't ship until 12/1/11 - disc is region free and the digital copy is allegedly compatible with iTunes (unlike the Amazon US version) and it was only $21.00 after currency conversion.  I wanted the Blu-Ray for my library but I keep all my movies on iTunes on a Mac Mini HTPC (which sadly doesn't support Blu-Ray) I have hooked up to my Sony LCD - I needed the TRUE digital copy (even though it's not HD) for my iPhone - I will NEVER purchase an Ultraviolet Blu-Ray.  Admittedly, I'm an Apple fanboi.....

If the ""Digital Copy"" doesn't work (but nothing I've researched says it will not) I'll just ""Handbrake"" it......  I purchased the disc, so I don't mind it if I have to do that to get it into iTunes.

Warner Bros should have thought about this when they decided to use Ultraviolet - True digital copies actually fight piracy because they have DRM, and they provide an incentive for people to actually buy their product.  Junk like Ultraviolet just discourages otherwise honest people by forcing them to do something they otherwise wouldn't do to get the product the way THEY, not the way the studios want it.  Ultraviolet is just another way for the studios to control their product after they've sold it - fortunately, THAT genie cannot be put back in the bottle.

If you're honest, aren't going to steal, and really want the true digital copy, just by the combo-pack from Amazon UK.......  Warner Bros/JK Rowling still get their money (as they should), but as a customer, you get the movie the way you want it........",1320969600,4,2166,4.5372750642673525

3818678,4,B001UV4XIS,"""It All Ends"" boasts a pale faced Neville up aloft my local AMC's fresh-plastered promo posters. In case you're over thirty or have somehow, like me, failed to leap aboard the Potter-Train (they started sometime back around eighth grade), Neville's just one of the lads at Hogwarts Academy for Wizards--like the X-Men series' mutant academy but with a pagan twist, or high-end Camden prep school once the cafe's milk cartons have all been laced with pharm-grade LSD. It's a heavy telephoto job--his bloodied Russel Crowe-like chin (did they recast with Russell Crowe?) fully distended from the twee marshmallow cheeks of Nevilles past. Director David Yeats, the series' fourth, has even propped him up there with a broadsword--the old fashioned kind that used to hack one's foes, tendon by meaty tendon, into little bits (conduct most unwizardly). When Neville does liquidate his Slythrine classmates you can rest assured he'll do em good n' clean.

Though don't be fooled, Harry is the man we've come to see--he's got a good thing going, too: Still in school means probably he sleeps till noon most days. He's a sports star so easily gets whichever girls he wants. He's fated to save Earth, or Wizard-Realm...Great Britain, maybe? (Is Hogwarts tax-exempt?) Basically, he can't go wrong. Let's not forget that now he's clearly alpha-wizard-internationale by the ripe age of 17. Hail, Harry Potter, King of Kindness, Face of Fortitude since 2001 (the books don't count)--my generation's new ideal for Chivalry and Virtue, prolonged and neatly franchised--now complete.

As far as storyline's concerned there isn't too much, really, to wrap up. Lord Voldemort and his pet snake must go. (He looks like the same ghoul that Jedi Mace Windu [Samuel L. Jackson] zapped some long time ago back in the Clone Wars film...same dull complexion, anyway...since then he's had his nose touched up at least a couple times--by Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons, it would seem) To do this Potter and his servile classmates must smash up all of the Dark Lord's favorite stuff: an evil cup, a deadly hat, and other monsters spawned from V's pernicious soul. Of course there's lots of 3d wandplay (wands...the anti-light saber), gratifying spells with Latin names that kill or maim without excessive bloodshed, racist Muggle jokes, and long awaited awkward sexual outbursts--though really, have we paid for eight admissions just to see them kiss? (They do derobe together, briefly, after falling in a lake)

Usually these late night fantasy/sci-fi premieres tend to marshal a particular fringe: the Basement-Dwellers--your neighborhood's most woefully obsessive demographic--yet on the morning of Friday July 17th all sorts of normal looking people marched around in black collegiate robes with strange hairdos and crudely whittled sticks--the `magic wands.' (Minnesota Law controversially allows its citizens to conceal and carry firearms pretty much wherever they please these days) As we arrived two fully grown adults were `magic dueling' in the foyer: faux Latin spells, looks of abstract concentration, phony British accents with prevailing Midwestern-American vowel sounds--the whole bit. With all the flash photography (most common were the suicide photographers: cameras firing backwards at arms length, approximating maybe two thirds of a shooter's frontal lobe), we had to rely basically on touch and intuition just to find our seats. (Without our 3d glasses, surely someone would have lost an eye) It seems that merely claiming `I was there' just doesn't cut it anymore--you need a thorough Twit-picking, or pretty much you don't exist--smart phones, the new pre-requisite for `real' participation in today's excessively objective #cinematichistory.

Aloft our 30th row stadium-style vantage of the great blank screen I spoke briefly with a woman dressed as Belatrix LeStrange, one of the Dark Lord's (really only moderately evil) thugs who is played by Helena Bonham Carter (a dish commonly paired with Johnny Depp) of Sweeny Todd and Fight Club fame. I'm not surprised that Ms. LeStrange outnumbered Grangers, Weasleys, and the ever-lovely Luna Lovegoods all combined--LeStrange: the Potterized equivalent of half the roles that Carter's ever played: a coquettish and sardonic goth stuffed in a doll-house style black dress. She's a bad girl but not so bad that teenage girls browsing around Hot Topic think there's something truly (perhaps only a bit aesthetically) weird about liking and maybe emulating her.

I asked her how she felt about the series ending. She fumbled, feeding fresh lithium-ion ammunition through a stout-lensed Cannon Powershot. ""It's over."" she said. ""After tonight my childhood's really over.""  She sounded thoughtful and composed, as if she'd given this a lot of thought. Her camera chirped and twittered as she tapped its LCD display--I tried to shield my eyes but never seemed to quite anticipate her flash. She went on to recall assorted adolescent memories with J.K. Rowling's books--pausing now and then to double-check the empty screen for trailers and taking little pulls from a friend's naggin-bottle of orange schnapps. There was an anecdote involving an ex-boyfriend and the third film's Blu-Ray DVD, something cute she'd read on Emma Thompson at NewsOfTheWorld.com, her thoughts regarding the true origins of Severus Snape. From 1997 to the present her whole life's chronology was pretty well intact. (I think I'm safe to just to assume that nothing of real consequence had transpired for this girl up until then) ""Tomorrow we will all wake up and I'll be an adult."" Indeed. I hope she took a really good new profile pic.

Slightly more dramatic were the revelers encountered in the parking lot after the show, lying prone and tearing at appropriately tailored clothes. One crawled and beat the asphalt audibly, another walked slowly in circles staring nowhere with dull eyes, wailing lamentations like a tweaking ex-narcotic fiend. ""It's over, dude!"" Hey man, nobody said that wizardry was easy.

These Potter addicts aren't the only ones upset. Since its Friday night release assorted non-secular institutions and their respective spokespeople have continued to take issue with the series' theologically unsavory themes which include but are not limited to witchcraft, spectral exaltation, and the lack of Christ as a central protagonist. Unlike Star Wars and Tolken's spirit hounding Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Harry Potter sets and dramatizes pagan worship in close proximity to our own Earth-bound human lives (at least it didn't take place in America)--too close to home to pass as purely fantasy. Though this is not withstanding all the really sinful stuff that's passing for reality in cinema these days. After all, Nick Stoller's Get Him to The Greek (2010) depicts a man being forcefully (and quite unconsensually) sodomized...by A WOMAN. Even confirmation flunkies of the rankest sort will know that's a deadly, if not extra-extraordinary sin. Once you've even seen the previews for a flick like Harry Potter, nowadays, a little quidditch and a horcrux here and there just doesn't seem so bad.

Besides the brutal disappointment this film left me feeling about my own non-magical genetic makeup and the usual sprained visual cortex upon apprehending two and a half hours of the world as it might appear had God created his own image in brilliant Imax-3d, I left the theatre on Friday with the notion that whoa, maybe I have missed out on a decade's worth of dragon-singed adventure and Hogwartian camaraderie.

3818683,5,B001UV4XIS,"**Actual Review of 3D Bluray release**

The final chapter of the Harry Potter series is here.  The film was well done, relaying the dark tone of the story.  I first saw this movie on Bluray in 2D.

After my 3 year son threw one of his toys into my flat-screen TV (lucky for him I was not a witness to his tantrum and destruction of a HDTV I paid nearly $4000 for.)

This lead to me having a good excuse to buy the latest tech.  Now kitted out with a 70"" 3D compatible HDTV and 3D Bluray I was able to experience a format that I has dismissed as a fad.  I had a few titles already in 3D and to my great surprise the 3D effects of Active Shutter 3D glasses were astounding rivaling the 3D features at Disneyland's Kodak Theatre (Captain Eo, and Honey I shrunk the audience.)

I got my hands on Harry Potter 7 parts 1 & 2 anticipating breathtaking 3D effects, boy was I sorely disappointed.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one was so poorly 3D encoded that I had to check my glasses to make sure they were charged, checked the TV to make sure it was in 3D mode.  That was how poor the 3D effects were.  It is no wonder Part 1 was never released in the theater in 3D.  I thought ""This must just be a poor quality 2D to 3D conversion after the film was completed.  Now I figured ""They had to have filmed part 2 with 3D cameras, they had to.""  I was wrong, save a few gags (e.g. the floating plate Professor Snape's tears are poured into to show Harry Professor Snape's memories and Voldemort's snake striking out) and even those were very poor.  There is nothing to be gained in purchasing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 3D.  The quality of the 2D transfers from film to Bluray are excellent.  Unless you can find the 3D for the same price, save your money, buy the 2D set.

And those who are taking shots at this movie and giving it 1 star because of it having a Ultraviolet code, enough already.  Just the fact that Warner Bros. has chosen to support the Ultraviolet streaming service, yes it's a streaming service not a digital copy, does not warrant 1 star reviews.  WB has been issuing iTunes codes and in some cases Plays for sure discs when asked.  I have gotten iTunes codes for every Bluray and DVD that had a redemption code for the UV streaming service.  Many people may look to buy a copy of this film, see the sub 3 star rating, and not purchase this excellent film.  Save you 1 star ratings for films like The Wicker Man or Ishtar.  Unfortunately UV may be here to stay, be happy that most DVD and Bluray sets include both UV and regular digital copies.  Enough trolling.",1320969600,5,2600,4.246435845213849
3818684,4,B001UV4XIS,"The journey that began with an innocent young boy discovering the world he belonged to comes to an end in an explosive and emotional finale in `The Deathly Hallows Part 2'.

 It is just so amazing to see how far these actors who were practically no names changed into incredible young men and women that managed to give such great performances for the final time. What started as an incredible drama ends in a fast paced battle between good and evil in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Still, in all the explosions and special effects the film is filled with emotion in two ways. The final film ties together the whole story, including some major revelations in Harrys' world and certain characters. Of course the main event in this film is the final showdown between himself and the one who wanted him dead ever since he was a child.

Personally I felt that there was just a little bit missing from this film, but as a whole especially seeing it along with `The Deathly Hallows Part 1' it does a great job giving the fans the ending they have been expecting to see. As a whole I am happy to say that while these films may not have been as great as the books themselves, they were by no means horrible films. I am so excited to finally have my complete collection of Harry Potter films and I intend to enjoy them again and again.

The 1 star is due to the false advertising, the bait and switch, the requirement to sign up for new services you likely do not want or need, and the questionable delivery of a promised product.

Sadly, the studio's business side has made a bad decision going with  UltraViolet.  The ""copy"" is cloud-based, not local to your machine.  Frankly the vendor can discontinue access at their whim and a user would have little recourse. The ""copy"" could disappear if UltraViolet fails as a business entity (hopefully).  The ""copy"" is likely not available in flight and on an international travel could cost you a bundle in data fees.  Not worth the risk, not worth paying extra for, and arguably the fewer people that buy the product the sooner this particular attempt at DRM fades in the sunset.

Recommendation:  Avoid purchasing any product with UltraViolet ""digital"" copies.  Wait for the studios supporting this scheme to come to their senses when they see revenues fall.  An email campaign to the studios wouldn't hurt.  See reviews of Green Lantern for additional rants on UltraViolet.",1320969600,19,1321,4.869955156950673

Read all the terms and conditions.  Read the privacy policy (or lack thereof) on Flixter and UV.

This system is full of bugs currently due to poor implementation.  You will have to register with Flixster and through Flixster create an Ultraviolet account.  This will let you STREAM your video via Flixster, but only if Flixster will talk to Ultraviolet.  My history with this comes from Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern where I could see the movies listed in Ultraviolet but kept getting an error from Flixster.  Warner Brothers (after several emails and a registered letter) finally emailed me a code to use with Itunes to get my digital copies as it WOULD NOT WORK through Ultraviolet.

Also keep in mind that Ultraviolet ""digital"" copies do not work with ITunes.  So if you purchased Deathly Hallows Part 1 and have it in ITunes, forget about having part 2 in ITunes unless you purchase the movie through that media.  You will not get it from purchasing the combo pack.

Ultraviolet is the worse thing I've seen for media management... and all because Warner Brothers refuses to negotiate with Apple to include their media in the ITunes media libraries.  Greedy Execs are hurting the end users so they can save a penny.

3818762,4,B001UV4XIS,"I don't have the DVD yet but I am anxiously waiting.  I have to say I had a lot of hopes for Part II and likely that's why I was disappointed.  Twenty more minutes would have taken this movie from good to great.  All that build-up for the end battle and then when it finally comes, pttthhh! it's over.  What happened to the big show down taking place in front of the whole school?  I'm sorry but for the climax of the film the death of our two most hated baddies was a huge disappointment for me.  Honestly, don't blink or you'll miss it!

It would have been nice to have seen how one of the twins was killed, or other main characters who suddenly we see are dead.  Killed by what?  And where was Hagrid's brother the half-giant?  We didn't see him in the battle at all.  Or Jinny...how she wanted to fight and people kept trying to stop her.  Nor did we see how Voldermort (sp?) uses his wand/power to flip Harry's limp body in the forest to incite laughs and jeers from his followers--which would have been painful to watch, but at the same time would have added to the darkness of this film.

So much in the books was not in the film, so once again the film does not do the story justice.  However, this is a whole different medium...and with that in mind, they're wonderful and very visual films, still worth seeing many times as I do.  I never thought I'd get into the Potter series--until I did.  And the writing!  I have tried to read the Twilight books.  Couldn't do it.  Maybe she gets better with practice but the first book was very simplistic.  People compare that book series to this one--no comparison.  Few know how to world-build like J.K. Rowling. Or make characters so multi-faceted as many we've gotten to know & love here.

What was great?  Pretty much everything else.  The old dragon was amazingly realistic.  At one point I could see the slide of muscle under his skin.  Very cool. Time to do the classic Pern series folks.  We have the stuff now to do that series justice.  Or at least the original first trilogy--I hated the later books.  Back to Potter--kudos for doing justice to the flashbacks revealing Snape as the devoted (to Lilly) and secret protector of Harry all these years.  For me reading that part of the story was very powerful and moving.  I was afraid the film would skim through what was a very important scene--and it did not.  It gave Snape the recognition he deserved--despite the fact the manner of his death was not quite right.

But I give this film four stars because of all the things we didn't get to see, that I wanted to see.  So many things.  Read the last book.  Better yet, get the audio book--the narrator is excellent.  So much more cool stuff happens you never see in this film.",1319673600,3,2738,4.393213572854291

3818802,2,B001UV4XIS,"I read the seventh book again before watching this movie, and found that source material hugely epic and enjoyable. The movie, however, was just as hugely disappointing, and not only because David Yates and co. decided to change so many plot points unnecessarily and for the worse.

The film's biggest problem is that so many character actions/interactions don't feel realistically urgent or emotional. Characters who should be going balls to the wall in this massively important life-or-death situation are often just standing around calmly with mild concern on their faces. (One of many examples: Ron and Hermione open the door to the Chamber of Secrets only to stand there as if they're not sure they should go in. Get in there and grab some basilisk fangs, already!)

David Yates has demonstrated a pattern of neutering HP characters emotionally and rendering them so understated that their personalities dissolve. (Listen to interviews with the man, and you'll hear how consistent this lack of verve is to his own personality.) Where's the anger and emotional heat that are naturally a part of this kind of battle? Are the 'good guys' just not allowed to get angry in David Yates' moral universe, no matter how deeply they're assailed? For example, in the book, Neville was a brave, hardened guerrilla fighter by the final battle, but in the movie, he can't even look Voldemort in the eye as he meekly informs him that he doesn't think it would be good to join the bad guys.

And it's not just anger and urgency that are lacking: there was no sense of personal or collective triumph at the defeat of Voldemort! (Partly, this is because the filmmakers made the stupid decision to have Harry beat Voldemort in private rather than in front of everyone.) Sure, it's an inherently mixed emotional bag, as many loved ones have died during the battle and Voldemort's extended reign of terror, but come on, the whole freaking world has been saved! Most glaringly, why is Ginny just sitting across the room after Harry not only turns out to be alive, but has finished off the baddest bad guy ever? One would expect her, as Harry's love interest, to be supremely happy at these facts.

More neutering: Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he's intentionally going to his death in the Forbidden Forest, and neither Ron nor Harry, supposedly best friends, decide they should maybe hug each other or say goodbye in any fashion whatsoever. (In the book, Harry doesn't tell anyone he's going to his death, so that he won't lose his resolve or have to explain/convince people to let him go. A much more interesting choice, but even if you go with the movie version, at least make it realistic.)

Some key moments were delivered well (e.g., Snape's death), but more often they were way off. As another reviewer noted, the duel between Molly and Bellatrix was completely, totally bungled. Rushed, unemotional, and stiffly acted and filmed.

Some fantasy climaxes are appropriately uplifting and epic, without minimizing whatever losses were incurred along the way. Despite interesting and well-executed moments here and there, the last HP movie was the opposite: boring, draining, unrealistic, and mostly unsatisfying. Most people fell unthinkingly in love this film, but to me, David Yates and friends have ruined perhaps the only opportunity to deliver a soaring cinematic climax to this series.

Long live Alfonso Cuarn.",1319155200,47,3407,4.987676056338028
3818803,4,B001UV4XIS,"Harry and his gang of Hogwarts rebels conclude their great 10 year adventure.  In this finale, Harry is indeed the focus as he must face Lord Voldemort once and for all and to the death.  Ralph Fiennes continues his great work as the evil Lord.  This movie also ties up a lot of loose ends and neatly shows us how certain events really took place.  I have to give myself credit for spotting one of those twists some time back.

My only beef with this whole series involves Harry and his inability to strike up a real romance with anyone.  He has eyes for Ginny (Bonnie Wright) but she's rarely around and even less so in this finale.  The production value here is as good as any movie out there.  The film is dark, scary and ominous throughout.  As the series progressed and the kids aged so does the tone tends to darken as well.

David Yates takes the director's chair again and doesn't disappoint.  Steve Kloves continues as he has from the beginning, to interpret Rowling's books with honesty and consistency.  Warner Bros. should also be congratulated for somehow managing to keep all the key actors together for 10 year and allow us to watch them grow and mature.  This has been a wonderful adventure which concludes with a flourish and a more than satisfying ending; including the epilog that shows our heroes 19 year into the future.  Now it's time to break out the hankies.

1-12-11:  Blu ray update.  This film is displayed in 2.40:1 anamorphic wide screen.  The film is purposely shot in gloomy colors keeping with the tone and this is transferred properly.  The contrast is excellent.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is superb.  There are many quiet scenes in the film yet the dialog is clear and centered.  The surrounds come into play when the action sequences are amped up.  There is one scene where Voldemort's voice circles around the room.  Cool.

3818806,3,B001UV4XIS,"I had hoped that a movie series that is so important as a reference to a set of books that are even more important would not fall victim to both overused and cliched endings.

I have already read how others have criticized the lack of spark of the reunion train platform scene.  It feels rushed, the makeup is terrible, and an opportunity is lost forever.

But leading up to that scene, let me go in reverse to the last scene of the 3, standing there on the bridge (and where did that bridge come from?).  Gee I supposed they could have crossed their wands in the air and uttered ""all for one and one for all,"" but it all looked so staged, too staged.  And then FREEZE FRAME!  Pan back...  Just terrible.....

We knew that action scenes would be added at the end, but the extended mano-a-mano is such a cliche'.  The point of the last battle is to once again highlight the differences between V and H, not set them up as gunslingers.

Before that, the difference between the Malfoys going into Hogwarts to find their son is SO different from what the director and writer chose to offer.....

It was unfortunate that Rowling gave the house elves so little to do in the last battle (and left so many questions unanswered as to what elf magic really is about) but to have them left out entirely at the climax of the movie? Creature's rehabilitation is part of that differentiation  between V and H.

But I am going beyond my initial objections....  I had hoped for some kind of creative ending beyond the usual cliche'.  Maybe it was too much to hope for.......",1318896000,4,1558,4.436619718309859

The movie that you are looking at is one of the first to use the new ""Ultra Violet"" system for digital copy and distribution.

The hype around Ultra Violet says that it will allow you to stream your digital copy to any device and the files are store in the cloud so that once you purchase a single digital copy you won't ever need to replace it when technology changes.  The reality is that the system is being forced on consumers before it is ready as of the release of Green Lantern and Horrible bosses (first 2 movies to use the system in mid October) exactly 0 mobile devices or set top boxes support the system and few will in the near future.

I had heard from others that had seen it that it was very true to the book.  They were right.  I was amazed to see the 2nd half of the book come to life on the big screen.  The special effects were incredible!  I do remember crying a few times during a few scenes...  Which is a good thing of course.

The acting was great.  Of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were terrific as always (loved them in the epilogue).  But the one person's performance who I just adored, even though he wasn't in the movie much was Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Talk about a riveting performance.  He deserves an award for the scenes he was in!  The scene between him and Harry was just so emotional and perfect.  You really learn to love Snape in this film.

I couldn't understand why she was so excited and when she compared the book series to Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy ""Lord of the Rings"" and Lucas's masterpiece saga ""Star Wars,"" I definitely was perplexed and cynical. After all, how could a few books (at the time) about a boy wizard compare to the profound mythological themes that represent life itself? Unlike most fans, I did not read the books and went into the film with an unbiased mind. When I saw the first installment, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I wasn't really impressed. It wasn't until 2004's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- when the series began getting darker -- that I started getting into the series. Now, I'm still no major fan, but I thoroughly enjoy Harry Potter and am reading the books. When I heard ""Deathly Hallows"" was going to be separated into two parts, I actually liked the idea because I knew the filmmakers were so dedicated to getting in as much as they could of the book and did not want to rush the production.

Well, in ""Deathly Hallows Part One,"" the parts were switched so that it was the one that was made up of mostly talk, drama and psychological elements. In this installment, ""Deathly Hallows"" goes out with a bang the way ""Kill Bill Part One"" did; it's basically non-stop action with the drama as a natural after-effect. Only in ""Deathly Hallows Part Two,"" rather than ending with a jaw-dropping question (like ""Kill Bill Part One""), it ends with satisfying closure for pretty much all of the characters and the acting is superb (anyone who wants to know how the other characters' futures end up, you can either read the books or look it up on the internet); I was one of many in the audience who was cheering when seeing what happens to Bellatrix (Helena Bonham-Carter, an actress I don't very much like). Before this one, my favorite of the Harry Potter film series was ""The Half-Blood Prince."" I still have a while before I'll be able to tell what my favorite book is in the series, but I can stand corrected in saying now that I can see the attraction to the Harry Potter series. Its themes do follow those of such aforementioned revered sagas from Tolkien and Lucas. While it is sad to see this series come to a close, I cherish the fact that I still have children to whom I can pass on these books and films.",1317945600,,3076,5.141716566866267
3818820,4,B001UV4XIS,"All in all I have to say that this is a fitting end to a great era.  The special effects where phenominal, the acting was supurb, overall a great visual representation of what I believe will become a household name in literature in years to come.  However, there is one thing that bumps me when comparing this movie to the book (and feel free to double check me because I have been wrong before.

***SPOILER ALERT***

As I remember the end of the book, Harry discusses with Dumbldore's portrait that Harry can keep the invisiblity cloak, the reserection stone would remain where it was dropped in the forbidden forest and the elder wand would be returned to Dumbldore's tomb where its powers would cease if Harry died undefeated.  This is where I have a problem with the movie, it has no visit to Dumbledore's office for conversation and to repair Harry's broken wand, and in the last shot of the movie before the time shift, Harry breaks the elder wand in half and throws it into the wreckage of Hogwarts.",1317772800,3,1006,4.566666666666666
3818821,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter is unlike anything - any story- ever seen or heard of. This movie has a much different feel than the others; the love, the friendship, the growing up, all that is behind and it's time to test everything you have ever known.

But ignoring the fact that the story is just plain out brilliant, this is for the movie.

I do think the beginning was, well, pretty rushed. Strange considering they split the book in two and this was the shortest movie yet (I believe it is, I haven't checked.) So I was upset that they did that, and there were a few other things I wished they had kept, like Harry returning the Elder Wand to where it came from after he fixed his own instead of breaking it. And other tidbits like that.
I am giving it 5 stars because it's story was so great and the emotional aspect of it was so high that it surpasses those flaws. We won't get another Harry Potter movie (unless they decide to remake them, I will NOT watch remakes of it) ever again, so this last movie is precious. No movie next year, or the year after that, this is it, the last, so why be negative?
Point is I loved it, loved it so much because overall the movies carried out the story the way they were meant to. Besides, after a while if the movie fanatics want more HP they can read the books and read what the movies missed.

From the trailers that I've seen for this movie it looked like it was going to be epic so i was hoping that this could be the movie that could change how I feel about the franchise, how wrong was I. This film's biggest downfall was its editing, it felt so rushed that it looked like I was watching half a movie. Also the final battle at Hogwarts is so anticlimactic in every way that it put me off, plus its pacing was also problematic even though it is the shortest movie of the series. Though not all was lost like some of the special effects which really shows how much CGI has improved over the years and Alan Rickman who plays Severus Snape was really good in this one(probably the only great thing about this movie), other than that though this movie really disappointed me. I really wanted to like it but that was not going to happen. For the fans they're going to like it regardless but for everyone else be warned.

3818824,2,B001UV4XIS,"First off, I get that the entire world seems to love this movie, almost blindly.  In my experience, the people I know who loved this movie the most are those who have not read the books.  I must say I envy them to a certain extent, because it is astounding how any film-maker could miss the cinematic opportunities presented by Rowling's amazing source material.

I honestly don't know where to begin.

Let's start with a single line of dialogue from McGonagall.  She is commanding the statues of Hogwarts to defend the school.  This could have been a powerful moment from one of the most underused characters in the film series (don't even get me started on Order of the Phoenix), but the moment is completely derailed by the line ""I've always wanted to perform this spell.""  The literary character of McGonagall never would have said that.  That line was simply juvenile, and a lame attempt to inject humor into a situation where it simply did not fit.

Then, we have a scene which should have made everybody in the theater want to stand up and cheer, but it was done in such a contrived way, it fell flat.  The scene I am referring to is, of course, the Molly vs. Bellatrix scene.  It was just entirely too rushed, and that little look of self-satisfaction on Molly's face afterward was all wrong.  A battle is still raging around her, her son is dead, and this was the first time she had ever taken a life to protect her child.  That look was wrong for the moment, wrong for the character, just WRONG.

What about Hagrid?  He shows up captured in the forest.  How he got there, nobody knows.  So many fans have been waiting to see the fierce giant come out in Hagrid.  In the books, he was a fighter.  In the films, he is, for the most part, a stuffed animal.  A scene of Hagrid taking out a dozen or more Death-eaters before being overrun would have been EPIC.  And then, in the courtyard battle, to get a couple of great shots of a raging Hagrid throwing Death-eaters around would have been equally epic.  This is where I just don't get David Yates as a director.  How hard would these Hagrid scenes have been to shoot?  You need a close-up of Robbie Coltrane showing some serious rage, then a wide shot of the scale double heaving some death-eaters on wires.  Was money an issue?  It couldn't have been time.  This was the shortest HP movie of the series, and the whole point of dividing the book into two films was so you COULD do this stuff.

Harry revealing himself to be alive should've been the most climactic moment of the movie.  Again, a stand-up-and-cheer moment. And it was completely anti-climactic.  We get a grin from Hermione.  Oh, Harry is alive.  That's nice.  I thought Neville was going to kill Nagini right there in the courtyard.  And in the moment that Voldemort goes down, temporarily weakened by the death of another Horcrux, Harry rises up.  The poetry and power of that moment would have been ELECTRIC.  And it falls flat.

Which leads me to Voldemort's death.  Okay, I admittedly enjoyed a lot of the chase and fighting through the castle between Harry and Voldemort, but it should've ended in the Great Hall, you know... like it did IN THE BOOK.  Instead, Harry defeats him with nobody around.  And how did he defeat Voldemort?  Well, that is a mystery. He successfully disarmed him, and apparently that's all it takes.  Even Voldemort's defeat is woefully underplayed here.  It should have happened in front of everyone, and now I guess they just have to take Harry's word for it.  What is it about main bad guys evaporating into the wind when they die?  There's bodies of dead students, teachers, you name it...  But I digress.

I get the sense that the film-makers and screen-writers think that the only characters we really care about are Ron, Hermione, and Harry.  It's sad to see such a waste of amazing talent and cinematic opportunities.

That said, I thought The Prince's Tale was handled beautifully.  If only the other important plot and character moments of the film were delivered as satisfyingly.  What a missed opportunity.  Again.",1316995200,88,4080,4.611420612813371

So I was quite surprised at how tight & easy to follow the final installment was. The escape from the vault on the albino dragon was quite thrilling. Snape's big reveal was touching. I didn't have to snooze through an endless cascade of anti-climaxes like I did with LOTR: RETURN OF THE KING. Well done. 6/10",1316908800,3,438,4.556962025316456

This yound wizard, whose name is Harry Potter, has grown in so many people's hearts and now this DVD will show his final battle between him and Lord Voldemort. It is the final showdown and, as we all know, only one will survive. I read the books and went to the theatre and I was still surprised at how this movie was presented. The director did a wonderful job. The entire cast was there, along with some new faces. I left the theatre in tears because it is the last Harry Potter film and I am sure that I am not alone. Maybe Hollywood will find a way to make another Harry Potter film one day (maybe a prequel?)

Anyway, the wait is over. Complete your collection today. I am sure that one day the manufactorer of these DVDs will make one ultimate package of all the DVDs, but that will surely be really expensive.

Just think about how rich J.K. Rowling is.

I am surely going to be watching this movie again and again. I truly only wish it was not the end of the Harry Potter films. Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley), and Emma Watson (Hermoine Granger) all return along with many, many others!

This is a finale worth seeing, even if you are not a Harry Potter fan. If you just like Sci-fi movies, this is your movie too. This movie touches on romance, drama, action, adventure, and comedy in some ways. This movie is a steal at $17.99 because you know the stores will want more. Order yours now, complete your adventure with Harry Potter and when you do finish this movie, head on over to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. Why? In Islands of Adventure, they have a Harry Potter ride. It will not be there forever, so go a.s.a.p.

The acting in this movie was great too. This movie captured the emotion really well in this film. The only thing that stunk in my opinion about this movie, was the very very end of the movie, at the train station. Other than that, this is a definite watch again. This is a really good end to a saga, as a whole. Would I recommend this to other people, yes.",1316822400,2,520,4.158415841584159
3818829,5,B001UV4XIS,"I think everyone can agree that there have been major ups and downs throughout this entire monster of a series, but I think I'm in the majority when I say that this is indeed a perfect ending. Not perfect, like book-perfect, for no matter how hard you try, you just can't recreate the true awesomeness of the books. But just truly a great end to the Harry Potter film franchise. I could nitpick certain details, being the addict that I am, but I'm not going to because as a whole, it just works from beginning to end.

Starting out a tad on the slow side, DH pt 2 very quickly escalates to non-stop action that doesn't cease until the near end. It will keep you glued to the screen, on the edge of your seat. There's so much to look at but you never really lose focus. The CGI is utterly fantastic, probably the best looking film since Prisoner of Azkaban. Then there's the beautifully moody score by my new favorite composer (since Benjamin Button) Alexandre Desplat.  You are always aware of it, but it is never distracting, and always moving.

The actors do such a fantastic job with their parts, and I'm not just talking about the three main ones. Radcliffe exceeded all my expectations and then some, and his two faithful companions were no different. You will see little cameos during the film, including Emma Thompson as Trelawney, who has maybe 1 line, but she made me smile nonetheless. Dame Maggie Smith delivers a stirring and surprisingly robust performance and delivers a line that had the entire theater roaring with laughter. Ralph Feinnes is even more sinister and frightening, never failing in his task to truly impress. Finally, I've saved the best for last. The absolute perfection that is Alan Rickman, as the always mysterious, never boring, Professor Severus Snape. The most brilliant casting in the entire series. He will break your heart a thousand times over, even for people who have read the books a million times. Finally, FINALLY we get to see him in all his glory. It's just a shame we had to wait 8 films to see it, but oh what a performance! Truly award-worthy.

I was a bit concerned for the epilogue but was extremely surprised and pleased by the way it came out. Very realisticly done. Subtle, and just right. I could not help but get a little misty-eyed, knowing it was finally all over. Thank goodness for the DVDs...",1316736000,3,2354,4.624401913875598
3818830,5,B001UV4XIS,"Deathly Hallows part 2 is the best of the Harry Potter series of movies.  There were a lot of important sequences from the book that had to be filmed just right to be able to pull off the emotional and dramatic impact - and the movie succeeded in all regards (Snape's memories, Harry using the resurrection stone and sacrificing himself to Voldemort, and the reactions of those that loved Harry seeing his ""dead"" body).  In previous movies, director David Yates has had a somewhat bad habit of deleting important parts from the books and adding parts that were not in the book (see Half Blood Prince for the best examples of this).  In this particular movie, Yates' adding, expanding, and showing things not necessarily shown in the book worked very well:  Hogwarts virtually turned into a prison camp with the teachers leading students in formation to their destination, Harry confronting Snape directly about his murder of Dumbledore, showing Ron and Hermione actually going into the Chamber of Secrets, and the much-expanded final battle between Harry and Voldemort.  Curiously missing was the explanation why Harry was able to return to life (Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection in Goblet of Fire which linked Harry to the Earth similar to Voldemort's own Horcruxes);  by sacrificing himself, Harry had become the ""master of death"" and the dementors could not affect him and all the people he cared about now had the same type of protection around them that his mother had put on him, and finally Harry not repairing his original wand with the Elder Wand...with all the talk of wand lore, this was very important to Harry to have his old wand back and was basically his final act before the epilogue.  The movies like to show the wands spells connecting, which really only happened once in GoF because Harry and Voldemort's wands had twin cores), but it's a good visual effect, along with smoke trails of the Death Eaters when they actually just appear or disappear when they apparate/disapparate.  With that being said, Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fantastic movie and is action packed, visually stunning, emotional, funny at the right times, and dramatic.  Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter and he is at his best in this movie.  My highest recommendation - I loved it!",1316736000,3,2289,4.891472868217054

3818834,2,B001UV4XIS,"I'm sorry to disagree with the majority of the other reviewers, but this film was to me the weakest of the eight that have been done on the Harry Potter novels. Anyone who hadn't read the book would have been completely lost from the very beginning, with too many incomprehensible plot elements thrown at him in rapid fire. Only someone with printed novel freshly in his mind as he entered the theater would have been able to keep it all straight and understand what everything meant.

In addition, several key scenes from the book are badly underdone in the film, chief among them the shoot-out between Belatrix le Strange and Molly Weasley. In the film version there is no last minute reprieve by all the families of the students charging into the battle to save the day --- Molly Weasley is just somehow there at Hogwarts for her big moment --- and then when it comes, it is just a matter of Molly delivering her key line and exchanging a few seconds worth of fire with Belatrix, and then it's over, before it's even well begun.

To make matters worse, there is absolutely no chemistry between Harry and his longtime love Ginny Weasley. She's just there, and screams once when it appears Harry is dead, and then appears strangely silent and wooden  as his wife, in the ""19 years later"" scene.

3818838,5,B001UV4XIS,"So many reviewers have already posted comments on ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"" so I don't think I need to summarize the storyline here. Picking up the story where the slow and uneven ""Part 1"" left off, the final installment marks the end of the Harry Potter series spanning more than a decade, with a balanced, appropriate climax.

The film's pace is faster than the previous chapter, focusing on the actions of the three main characters Harry, Ron and Hermione, and their desperate search for the remaining Horcruxes. The battle scenes have become more spectacular and powerful with fantastic use of special effects and effective editing.

Watching ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is like attending a school reunion. Many (if not all) characters who appeared in the series will come back. It's nice to meet Gary Oldman again, though his time is very brief. Blink your eyes and you will miss Emma Thompson.

With exciting actions, stunning visuals and fine production designs, the second ""Deathly Hallows"" is a fitting grand finale to the long-running series that started in 2001, wrapping up the long story with a pleasing coda.",1315612800,3,1163,4.984536082474227
3818839,3,B001UV4XIS,"Let me preface this by saying that Deathly Hallows, Part 1 was one of my favorite films last year, and with such giants as the Social Network and the King's Speech, that is high praise. It was character driven and emotional at a point that only Alfonso Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban had previously managed.

'Hallows Part 2', however, is an action movie as devoid of soul as its antagonist. It relies quite heavily on the previous seven films - its seven Horcruxes if you will - to create emotion and a sense of impending doom and danger. Sure, we see things explode, we see things crash and bang and boom. But the way David Yates handles the deaths of characters - off-screen with little mention even after the fact - sucks the emotional impact and the sense of danger from the film.

It's a fun ride to be sure; the Battle of Hogwarts is immensely entertaining to watch, with wonderful effects and cinematography that would make Peter Jackson weep. I recommend the movie for that alone - it is a visual treat. The roll call of the British A-list cast is a joy to see, with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman being standouts in their wonderful portrayals of Professors McGonagall and Snape respectively. Snape's major scene late in the film is the high point of both the film and quite possibly the series, with his acting chops being put to full use and providing a truly moving experience that exceeds the rest of the film's emotional bankruptcy.

Potter fans will certainly be divided with Yates' changes to the source material in some parts, but overall I feel they will be placated. Do not expect the impact of Prisoner of Azkaban or Hallows 1, but prepare to be blown away with some fine, fine action sequences.",1315094400,11,1712,4.60655737704918

3818841,5,B001UV4XIS,"Some are like that. We don't expect total fidelity in all details, but spiritual fidelity. I can't help feeling the last movie made Snape too different from what he is in the book. The movie glamorized and enlarged his part.

Snape as envisioned by Rowling would never have whispered tenderly to the baby Harry.  In the book, Snape was an mean, malicious, physically unappealing character who loved one person his entire life and who, with Dumbledore's help, which included tremendous moral pressure, stayed true to the side of the person he loved. Snape was on Voldemort's side until he killed Harry's mother.

Rowling said she always wanted Alan Rickman to play Snape. In the book, she continually refers to Snape's greasy hair and huge hook nose. If an actor that resembled what she wrote had been cast in the part, Snape would not be what he is to many, which is a sex symbol.

The final movie makes it seem as though Snape always liked Harry and just pretended to hate him. In the book, he genuinely hates Harry, but he nonetheless remains faithful to Dumbledore and the anti-Voldemort side, which is the side of Harry's parents.

The movie was a bit false to the spirit of the book, in that Harry's father was belittled in order to elevate Snape. After seeing the movie, some people got the impression that Snape was Harry's father, which was never intended by the author. In the book, the father was killed trying to hold off Voldemort to give Harry and his mother time to escape. Harry's father also once saved Snape's life when they were at Hogwarts together. The movie treats the father somewhat cavalierly.

Snape is instinctively on the Deatheaters side, but when he loves a anti-Deatheater who is murdered by Voldemort, he turns on that side. It seems that if Voldemort had not killed Harry's mother and had killed ever so many others, Snape would not have left that side. It is the murder of Harry's mother that turns him. That says something about the power of love, also revenge. Love elevates Snape and makes him stick to the anti-Voldemort contingent.

Snape also represents the struggle between good and evil in one person. He has to struggle to be on the good side. For some reason, such characters hold great appeal.",1314316800,3,2237,4.720512820512821
3818842,4,B001UV4XIS,"Overall, I love this movie like I love the other movies.  Harry Potter is, and always will be, part of my childhood.  It's hard not to love something that I've known the majority of my life.  However, I have some things I'd like to address.  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE(S)/READ THE BOOK, SPOILERS FOLLOW.

I enjoyed the movie, but after re-reading the book right after seeing it, I noticed that Part II mostly focused on the Battle of Hogwarts.  Understandable, since that was a very crucial plot element.  I enjoyed the way they portrayed the battle, what with all the sparkly CG effects.  It was very nice.  However, they left out things in the movie that I REALLY wanted to see.

Rather than do some long-winded explanation of the other things I loved/hated, I'll just make a list.
THINGS I LOVED ABOUT THE MOVIE:
--Voldemort's death:  I like the way Voldemort dissolved after Harry ""killed"" him (though, technically Voldy killed himself, since the Elder Wand wouldn't hurt its true master).  I thought that was far more climatic than the way he just dropped dead in the book.  Of course, they left out a lot of the dialogue between the two, which I loved when I read it in the book.  The dialogue also explained why the Elder Wand would fail Voldemort, something that was added in the end as an after thought, almost.  Again, I think the music really made me love this scene even more (playing Lily's Theme at the end where Voldy's turning to ash...wonderful).
--Snape's Death & Memories:  I was super touched by these scenes.  Alan Rickman does an absolutely amazing job at playing Snape.  The Prince's Tale left out several scenes (most from Lily and Sev's childhood friendship), and it added the scene where he holds her dead body crying (that was the part that made me cry almost uncontrollably). I loved the added scene where Lily was whispering to baby Harry, too.  Again, waterworks on, full-blast.  Snape's Death scene had more dialogue and was different from the book, but I loved how he told Harry that he had Lily's eyes.  Again, I was so tearful I could barely make out the screen.
--Battle of Hogwarts scenes:  I LOVED the ""Statues"" part, where they're all lining up to defend the castle.  Excellent music there (I think movie soundtracks make a difference when it comes to how much I love/hate a movie).  Also, I loved the bit of comedy added by Minerva.  I laugh at that every time.  And, of course, I liked the shiny CG effects (Aberforth's wave Patronus was pretty freaking sweet).
--The Gray Lady:  I liked this scene more so in the movie than the book (though it was EXTREMELY different).  I thought Helena had more emotion in the movie, and I thought that was appropriate.  I wasn't a big fan of her in the book (too haughty for my liking), but I liked her scene in the movie.  I think the two scenes, movie scene and book scene, are completely different, though.

THINGS I DISLIKED ABOUT THE MOVIE:
--Dumbledore's story:  this was a third of the final book, and yet it was only mentioned in passing in both parts of the film.  I know you can't include EVERYTHING from the books in the film (imagine how long that would be...), but I thought they left out this crucial part.  Since it really puts doubts in Harry's head about his mission Dumbledore left him, and Dumbledore in general.
--The Horcruxes:  they were never properly explained in HBP, but now, suddenly, Harry knows what all the Horcruxes are and where to look for them (for the most part).  I think they should have added more in HBP about this, since I can see how it would be confusing for those who haven't read the books.
--The Hallows:  absolutely no explanation for any of them aside from the story scene in Part I.  Nothing about how Harry was related to Ignotus or how he was the true master of the Hallows, etc..  Again, I understand that the film isn't a book, but I thought they'd put that in...I mean...since the book/films are named after the Hallows....
--The Elder Wand:  what really ticked me off was that Harry broke the Elder Wand and threw it away.  I mean, jeez, I know he didn't want it, but...  He was SUPPOSED to fix his wand, be all happy that it works again, and then leave the Elder Wand with Dumbledore.  Very disappointed in this....
--Neville x Luna:  wat....?  No; just...no...
--Percy:  he made two minor appearances (I admit, I didn't know it was him at first...).  I really wanted to see the scene where he reunited with his family, and ESPECIALLY the scene where he shields Fred's body after he's killed.

In all, I loved the movies, but I felt like it was rushed in the sense that the film makers were cramming in order to meet a deadline.  They left so many unanswered questions, and left out so much (again, I KNOW movie = not book).  I loved it, but I still could have been better.  The flaws aren't going to stop me from buying it when it comes out, though (hardcore Potter fan).  I do look forward to see what the deleted scenes are going to be.

Well, that was long-winded, anyways, wasn't it.  Oops.

3818844,5,B001UV4XIS,"I was prepared to be disappointed in this film, after all the hype, and all the positive reviews. But I wasn't. I was riveted the entire time, and very moved in the end. I thought every single person turned in a stunning performance - Ralph Fiennes is breathtaking as Voldemort, as is Alan Rickman as Snape, all three young leads, and the fabulous British supporting cast. It was great to see so many of the latter back, albeit briefly.

As for the plot, you won't follow it unless you've read the books and/or seen the other films. The action revolves around Harry and his friend's search for the final horcuxes - pieces of Voldemort's soul he's hidden away for safekeeping - and the climactic battle that ensues. And the battle at Hogwarts is epic, truly marking this as a timeless film about good and evil, what is worth fighting for and what is worth loving. It is moving and deep, and it is very adult - this is not a children's, or even really a young-adult, story or film at this point.

One thing that not many others have mentioned about this series is the spiritual aspects, which is part of why it is a favorite series of mine, and I think this is carried off really well in this film. Harry's meeting 'in the light' with Dumbledore is handled brilliantly, without being sappy or preachy. Snape's discussion with Dumbledore re: why Harry must die, and the Christ-like message regarding his role as a saviour, is also handled with a deft touch. The result is a movie with many universal spiritual themes that does not come off as preachy or sentimental.

Overall, I don't think this could have been done better. I am sad to see it end, but so thrilled that the conclusion was so satisfying in every way.",1314057600,2,1713,4.519354838709678

3818846,3,B001UV4XIS,"I have been an unashamed Harry Potter fan since the year 2002, after seeing ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for the first time. The books are without a doubt my favorite fantasy series of all time, and the films some of the best that any major movie studio has ever produced; but that being said, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the finale as a whole.

This has, in my opinion, a lot to do with J.K. Rowling's treatment of the last novel. Up until book six, I had been mesmerized by the depth and uniqueness of the world she had created and felt that the series couldn't possibly have a bummer in it, seeing as how tightly and carefully the plots were wound and how well the characters were written. But after ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", she seemed to lose her grip on the storyline, and ""Half-Blood Prince"" and ""Deathly Hallows"", while both being incredibly important to furthering the plot concerning the intertwined fates of Harry/Lord Voldemort, seemed so full of incredible faults with their respective titular storylines that they were almost non-cohesive to any of the other novels that had come before them and meandering to the point of absurdity. The introduction of the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows always felt largely contrived and nowhere near as significant a McGuffin as say the Goblet of Fire or the Sorcerer's Stone, and often left me wondering why they were even introduced at all. The gripping mystery that often held me in suspense throughout ""Chamber"", ""Goblet"", or ""Order"" just wasn't there, and the brutal and numerous deaths seemed to be thrown in just to create a shock factor.

Although I knew exactly what I was going to see, I viewed this last film simply to achieve closure on a series I dearly loved, and while not my favorite, it was pretty good, despite its faults. While among the most heart-pounding of the Harry Potter films, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2,"", is easily the most heart-wrenching, ranging from scenes of intense cathartic emotion to all the horrific gore and gristle of war. It usually takes a lot to get me to cry in a movie, but this film had me weeping almost continually for at least the last half-hour.

I can't say it was the most enjoyable of the films, because it simply isn't possible to enjoy a movie with so much blood, death and destruction taking place almost every minute; but nevertheless, I liked it, and felt that even the few small changes did much to improve it from the book.

The film starts off at a moderately slow pace, the calm before the storm, and then gradually escalates into a full-blown battle between the forces of Good and Evil. I, like many other reviewers agree that not enough time was spent on the minutiae: the more intimate aspects of the battle, or the deeper expositions of the characters, which should have been explored a bit more, seeing as this is the last outing for them; and that many finer points of the plot were glossed over; but all in all, it had a generally good pace throughout. To those who have read the book, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to understand what's going on.

At some moments, the gruesomeness got to be a bit much for me--I wish that the general carnage (including several beloved characters) had been lessened from Rowling's vision. In fact, I believe that a little more gore was added. I would have appreciated it if even one or two characters had been spared, if only to lessen the faintly drained, depressing feeling at the end that it wasn't all worth it, even after You-Know-Who has been defeated,  because so many people died in the process.

The scriptwriter Steven Kloves did manage to inject a few of his own ideas into the thread, including a re-entrance into the Chamber of Secrets (an incident that was mentioned after-the-fact in the book), or an epic-scale, all-out cat-fight between Harry and Voldemort, in lieu of the cat-and-mouse banter from the pages of the novel. As to the ending, which is different from the book, I like what the he chose to have Harry do with the Elder Wand. It gives a good insight into Harry's ethics versus those of Dumbledore or Voldemort, who both wanted the wand solely for the immense power they would gain from it.

As for the score, Alexandre Desplat really hit home with it. It is vastly better than his work on ""DH1"", and the snippets of Nicholas Hooper's ""Dumbledore's Farewell"" and John William's ""Hedwig's Theme"" add an element of nostalgia, particularly in the last scene, that is a welcome addition for the final installment.

All of the actors and actresses give their all for this last Potter outing, and there isn't one among them that gives a bad performance. Particularly outstanding this final time around is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and Daniel Radcliffe as the ubiquitous Harry Potter. The scene between them in the boathouse had me sobbing my eyes out, as did the scene with the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest. There is no doubt in my mind that both sorely deserve an Academy Award for the sheer brilliance of their performances, and make watching this movie worthwhile, if only to see them so expertly practicing their craft.

Alan Rickman probably has the most screen time of anyone except for Harry himself, due to numerous flashback sequences in the Pensieve, in which Snape's whole arcane history is revealed, albeit somewhat quickly. Rickman is simply incredible, and manages to build sympathy for a character whom most people probably little more than entirely despised as only a true actor can.

Daniel Radcliffe, a person whom I have always believed to be very talented at what he does, comes out swinging in his final performance as the legendary boy wizard. He gives the character such emotional depth and steadfast resolution--he's no longer just Dan Radcliffe playing Harry: he is Harry. I was deeply moved, often to tears, by his outstanding job in this film, something very few actors can achieve with me.

To conclude my review, ""DH2"" is not perfect, but the novel wasn't perfect, either. While the film was lacking in spots and certainly had room for improvement, as a fan, I was quite pleased with it, and feel it was a fairly decent ending for the whole Potter series.",1313884800,8,6259,4.716376944190302

3818848,5,B001UV4XIS,"...I can safely say this is the movie of the year.

As a die-hard Potter fan, the midnight screening of this film will forever go down as the greatest experience I've had at the cinema. Just being in the cinema with people just like me, who lived through their childhoods with these amazing characters, who became our friends we wish existed... A truly phenomenal experience. I had never felt such a sense of togetherness in my life. So to join these diehards in staying up till the very beginning of Friday, July 16th to witness this finale... I must say that experience changed my life.

And I do not exaggerate when I call this film the best movie of 2011. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances.

Understandably this is the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.

The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a ""alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can"" mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full badass mode.

Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.

In short, Deathly Hallows 2 is phenomenal, the best of the series, and the best film of 2011. Rarely have I connected with a movie as emotionally as I did with DH2, and that said, this was the right way for me to say goodbye to my childhood properly.

OVERALL: 10/10

Pros: DH2 is the perfect balance of crowd pleasing and fan service, allowing everyone to have a blast. It is a stellar finale that demands to be watched, you have no choice!

He's supposed to be a beloved wizard, and tons of people get whacked or nearly whacked because of him, yet he has nothing to say to them nor vice versa as he strides through scenes of destruction. Multiple confrontations between the goodies and baddies in which almost no feeling is expressed. (I watched the movie with a Potter enthusiast, who tried to explain to me that the British tend to keep their emotions suppressed. Ahem.) Potter saves his rival in a perfunctory fashion, but there seems to be no emotional involvement by either party. And there you have the horcrux of the movie's problems: it's emotionally hollow in so many places. Perhaps the director was worried foremost about how the CG would play out. Perhaps nobody in charge really gave a hoot about how characters should react to such extraordinary circumstances.

3818851,4,B001UV4XIS,"I understand JK Rowling felt at the end she was on a treadmill - write a book, promote the book, consult on the movie, write another book, etc. She is a wonderfully talented fantasy writer but the strain is beginning to show and I am sure she is glad the whole thing is over and she can move on the something more creative and less structured.

The acting of the kids Radcliffe, Watson, Grint, etc, has gotten better and better as movies go along. When last we left our hero in part one, England had been completely taken over by Voldemort and his forces. And taken over England looked remarkably like prewar Nazi Germany, Hitler Youth like a far Right-wing take over. Red and black Nazi-ish flags everywhere.

Here in the last, Harry Potter and his small cohort of magicians confront the powers of evil incarnate, with pretty predictable results. And predictably, there are always ""surprises"": good guys who turn villains and villains who are secret good guys. And a final battle for the world. Lots of special effects and explosions. Very dark. Go expecting the last two movies to be dark and downbeat nearly from beginning to end. What brightness in color and emotion and happiness that is there only comes in the brief dnouement. This movie and it's pair may be too negative and intense for young kids.

There are two clever lines: in one the ghost of Dumbledore says to Harry when Harry sees a vision and questions it's reality,  ""Of course it's only in your head. That doesn't meant it isn't real"" or words to that effect.

The other funny line; Harry sees a vision of Charing Cross Railway station (used many times in this series) and says ""Well it's just like Charing Cross, only clean!""

An OK movie and a suitable end for the series, but I long for the charm, magic, humor and innocence of the earlier books/movies. More (and better) can be expected from Rowling now that she's' off the treadmill.",1312675200,5,1907,4.627218934911243
3818852,4,B001UV4XIS,"Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) continue their search for the pieces of Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and return to Hogwarts for a final showdown.

Unless you're already steeped in Harry Potter lore, you would do well to rewatch Part 1 (or at least review the synopsis on Wikipedia) before seeing this.  I didn't, and I didn't have a photographic memory of the last film, so I was a little confused in the beginning (Sword of Gryffindor?  Oh yeah--Dobby died.  Where'd that wandmaker come from?), but that's okay.  I wouldn't have wanted them to waste valuable screen time rehashing all that.

Where the last film gave our heroes some much needed quiet time before the storm, this film is a series of special effects set pieces.  There are so many loose ends to tie up and so many characters to bid farewell that the screenplay begins to resemble a checklist at times.  Some of the characters receive very short shrift, but that can't be helped.  The filmmakers didn't have the luxury of an unlimited running time, as J.K. Rowling did when she wrote her book.  This barrage of magical artifacts and familiar faces had the unfortunate result of making none of it feel particularly important, but the film still worked for me because the friendship between our three heroes remained firmly in the foreground.  So I was satisfied with the conclusion of their story even though I wasn't much concerned with the fate of each Magical Whatsit and I was underwhelmed by the final showdown with Lord Voldemort.  I appreciated the little epilogue at the end.",1312588800,3,1597,4.85239852398524

This was a great finale to a fine series of books and films.  While I was very disappointed in Part I, which was essentially a gorgeously filmed travelogue, and almost didn't go to Part II because of it, I'm glad I broke down and did. I'm still confused as to why they didn't get to the point and just do Deathly Hallows as a single film.  I assume the Deathlyl Hallows was going to be hideously expensive to make, and a less expensive Part I would help defray the cost of the whole without making the film prohibitively expensive to audience.  You saw Deathly Hallows on the installment plan so-to-speak!

Part II is essentially a very ""dark"" film, both cinematically and metaphorically, but it brings about a dnouement that has been building up for almost a decade.  The film follows the book closely with just a slight alteration in the role of the Snape character.  This was totally acceptable in my opinion, since although I could understand both his behavior and his motivation, I wasn't always certain that the books themselves made either very clear to the reader.  One had to do a lot of reading between the lines, which for an adult was not that difficult, but which for younger readers might have been.  I think it was important, because it revealed yet again that one cannot always assume one knows what's going on beyond the surface that people present to us.  I think it was also a good source of character development for Harry, since he came to understand at the moment of the man's death, that his life had been lived in almost constant sacrifice for the love of Harry's mother and for Harry himself.  It was a beautiful and well played role, and I think Alan Rickman deserves public acknowledgment for creating it so superbly.

As usual for a ""good versus evil"" film, there are deaths of a number of familiar characters, but that happens in any war.  In fact the entire build up to the event would have seemed familiar to those who grew up before WWI and fought during it, and definitely to those who grew up to fight in WWII.  Likewise, characters that had been taken rather lightly as children grew up to take a far more active and dedicated role in these events than their friends would have expected or even they themselves might have predicted.  Even characters who had been considered evil, who may even have been evil at the moment, stepped up to the plate when it became obvious that no one could stand on the sidelines and expect to come out of the fray unaffected.  Nor were acts of courage, sacrifice, or kindness forgotten.  Wonderful lessons.

A great climax to a beloved series.",1312243200,2,2859,4.570588235294117
3818854,5,B001UV4XIS,"This is it. Ten years after the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's world-wide bestselling novels, the Harry Potter series has finally reached its epic conclusion, setting the usual box-office records that accompany its arrival. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a landmark in this wildly successful series; not only is it the final installment, but at 130 minutes it's the shortest Potter film, and is the first to be presented in (post-converted) 3D. The film functions as the climax to the Harry Potter saga, as well as a reunion of all the characters we know and love. Every character here seems to get their moment and whether you're a casual fan or a complete fanboy of the series, there's a lot of emotional stuff here. As the title reflects, there's also a lot of death and this makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 the most emotionally-charged entry in the series...It may also be the best of the series.

The film begins with the final shot of Part 1, but truly opens with a marvelous, monochromatic shot of Hogwarts. From there, it is right back to Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) interrogating the goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis, doing double duty) about where to find the remaining Horcruxes so they can finally destroy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Their quest will eventually lead them to a final confrontation at Hogwarts, now in shambles with Snape (Alan Rickman) as the new headmaster. Having never read the final book, I have largely avoided spoilers and I will assist you in doing the same.

This film is set apart from the others by becoming noticeably darker. The whimsical fantasy elements are practically absent and the tone has matured along with the characters. This darkness is reflected tonally (you know you're in for something dark when Voldemort appears in fetus form) but also in the overall look, which is brought to life brilliantly by the limitlessly talented production team and director David Yates. It's not hyperbole that every aspect of the production looks stunning. Cinematographer Eduardo Serra has made even the most macabre images into shots of pure beauty, while the various elements of set design and art direction are impeccably rendered. Even Alexandre Desplat's score seems much more haunting than usual. The CGI department should be given raises for their astounding work on the spellbinding CGI which, when juxtaposed with the sets, costumes, and photography, make this film breathtaking to behold.

These films have used nearly every British actor available and many of them reappear for a final time, particularly Maggie Smith (as Professor McGonagall) and Jim Broadbent, both absent from the last film. Even in the final chapter, there is still room for new faces including the, relatively unknown, Irish actor Ciarn Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. The actors give their all in their roles, with some even saving their best performances for last. Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort, more so than ever before and his performance really blossoms here into the fully-realized incarnation of evil it's intended to be. Radcliffe, meanwhile, has not only grown in age, but also as an actor and he carries this film triumphantly in a way that only a real, mature actor could. The studio took a risk casting him, as well as Watson and Grint, but hopefully their success and growth throughout the years will encourage studios to be less weary of such risks. I believe the best performance may be by Rickman, still delightfully evil as Snape. Rickman leads this brilliant character through one of the best character arcs of any film series and he is as fascinating to watch as ever, giving a performance that stirs conflicting feelings of spite, as well as empathy and sadness. He has given a great performance since the beginning, but he's able to provide an emotional climax that really allows his performance to be fully appreciated.

Any complaints to aim at this installment are few and far between, and some criticism may be at aspects taken directly from the book. First, the film almost seems apprehensive to reach its conclusion, throwing in everything it can at the last moment to keep it from getting there. That's not to say it drags or grows boring, it just feels drawn out at times. Finally, the epilogue (which is taken from the book) extends the metaphor of the series further than necessary. Not that this metaphor was ever closely concealed, but it pushes it from overhanging to blatant. It's a nice, simple ending and despite my reservations, I can't imagine a better one.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a miraculous achievement that closes the book on one of the most well-crafted series of films ever released. I hesitate to say it's the best film in the series, as my memory of the others has waned over the years, but I can't fathom how any of the other films could pack as much of a punch as this one. Aside from how stunning it looks, it's also heart racing and, for two hours, almost unbearably suspenseful. This is a landmark in cinematic history, an exciting and entertaining piece of pop culture, and a brilliant fantasy film. As one-half of a whole finale, it complements its counterpart brilliantly and stands alone as near-perfect end to a near-perfect saga.

GRADE: A

Due to a complete lack of 2D showings, I was forced to see the film in 3D, despite reservations about an already dark film being made darker by the 3D glasses and a weariness of the film being converted to 3D in post-production. To my surprise, the picture was still clear and no-less stunning than I'd imagine it would look in 2D. The 3D neither detracts from the film nor adds anything to it. I applaud Warner Bros. for the effort they put into the conversion, despite its complete lack of worth. The 3D does not draw you into the world onscreen nor does it throw anything at you. Essentially, it is completely unnecessary if for you to pay an additional fee for a supposed additional dimension that adds nothing additional.",1312070400,,6061,4.872938894277401
3818855,3,B001UV4XIS,"The movie deserves zero stars, but I gave it three stars, because I felt that the actors all did a really good job on this one.
 The storyline is unlike the book on almost every point. Places of major events were changed, added dialog, dialogs swapped from one character to another, and on and on and on.

 The film is so dark(literally), that it is hard to make anything out. Most of the movie seems to have been filmed through a blue filter, ruining the realistic, and extraordinary backgrounds of the filming locations. A ton of graphics added in over everything, so that most of the time you aren't sure even what room or area the characters are in.

 The ending is the worst. The book concluded in a concise fashion, and explained everything in the last ten minutes or so, but the movie left all of that out. Instead there is that swirl of graphics over the top of everything, which just basically ruined it. The final part of the movie concerning the ""wand"" was changed(like the rest of the movie), for no apparent reason except that they could.
 All in all, a bummer for anyone who loved the books. They should have had Peter Jackson(The Lord Of The Rings) direct it, it would have been great!",1311724800,8,1200,4.481651376146789
3818856,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter gets the best ending imaginable and one that should please even the most skeptical fans of the books.  I have always had the ability to separate the books from the films, but there are many people that can't and end up judging a movie by how close it is to the book.  The saying ""The book is better"" almost always applies to adaption's (that was unintentional alliteration by the way), but that doesn't mean the films aren't successful.  In fact, every Harry Potter film is ""certified fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes, with Deathly Hallows Part II standing at the top with 96%.  For me, the only films that were better than their book counterparts were Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows.  I felt like for the most part the changes made in these three films was an improvement on the book.  For example, the change made in Part I with Hedwig ultimately made more sense and flowed in the movie much better.  Part II mixed action, romance, and comedy seamlessly, which are all the things that made the franchise great in the first place.  I get the feeling that when we are able to watch Deathly Hallows in it's entirety, it will flow extremely well and even though the two parts differ a lot in the way they look and feel, they seem like they will go together very well.

As for the franchise as a whole, here are some popular complaints about the series that I disagree with:
""David Yates ruined the Harry Potter Franchise""- Yates had a tough job with his first two films.  Order of the Phoenix is a ridiculously long book that doesn't have a main objective throughout most of the book, and Half-Blood Prince is the toughest adaption by far with no main villain.  The stark difference in all of his films proved that he is the second best director in the series after Cuaron (and ultimately could be the best, as it seems he will have a great career).
""1 and 2 are the best in the franchise""- The first two are good in their own right, but they are lacking visually and the villains are one-dimensional.
""Michael Gambon is an abomination""-  Gambon did not take over where Richard Harris left off, but he still played an effective Dumbledore and improved in every successive film he was in.  Unlike Harris, Gambon made you believe he was the most powerful person in the franchise.  I got the feeling that Harris would have really struggled with some things that would be required of him later in the series, but he was a tremendous actor.
""Deathly Hallows should have been one movie""-  Ironically, I have seen people say that Part II is rushed but that Deathly Hallows should have been one long movie.  Huh?  A 3 hour movie would be incomprehensible and beyond rushed.
Harry Potter= Necessary addition, Twilight = Money Grab
""Characters deaths should have been more emotional""-  This is a common complaint from hardcore fans.  In my opinion, the film nailed the deaths.  In the book, there are characters that get one line dedicated to their deaths, so some problems are because of the book.  However, I feel like if every character gets an emotional song and dramatic moment, it would lose its impact very quickly.  In Part II, some of the best moments are the ones without dialogue. Harrys reaction to seeing the ones he loves die are powerful scenes in their own right.
""There should have been a crowd during the final battle""-  This is a reasonable argument but I think having people cheer would have been superficial considering everyone lost loved ones and friends.  If you won a battle, would you be clapping and cheering even though you lost a friend or sibling just moments before?

In conclusion, when people think of this past decade in films it will most likely be remembered for comic book movies, the Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter (and Batman of course deserves a separate mention from comic book movies, what I believe will be the best trilogy of all time).  Harry Potter is an incredible achievement for many different reasons.  Actors were picked when they were 10 years old and for the most part all turned out well.  I feel like the films improved as they went on, which is unheard of.  Has there ever been one franchise this long that was so consistent, and one where the last film was arguably the best.

My opinion changes all the time, but right now here's how I would rank them (with Rotten Tomatoes ratings):
1. Deathly Hallows Part II (96%)
2. Prisoner of Azkaban (91%)
3. Order of the Phoenix (77%)
4. Deathly Hallows Part I (79%)
5. Half-Blood Prince (83%)
6. Goblet of Fire (88%)
7. Sorcerer's Stone (80%)
8. Chamber of Secrets (83%)

If you are a huge fan of the books but have never gotten into the films, I highly suggest you try to give them another chance with an open mind.  The films aren't for everyone, but it would be a shame to disregard the series just because some decisions made weren't the same as how we would make them.  Harry Potter is the most profitable film and book franchise of all time, and it's for a good reason...",1311638400,3,4985,4.571428571428571
3818857,3,B001UV4XIS,"Four years after the Harry Potter book series concluded, the accompanying film series finishes up as well with this second half of the screen adaptation of the Deathly Hallows novel. The movie series was overall an impressive achievement and has added to the overall experience of the Harry Potter universe. Nevertheless the films seldom reached the consistently high level of execution that the novels did, and comparisons aside, there have been some false steps along the way. Part 2 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows contains its share of miscues. But overall it entertains and is particularly successful as an action and adventure experience. Its ending satisfies even while leaving fans wishing the story could continue forever. This review is of the content of the theater release of the movie. It does include SPOILERS.

The movie is anchored by several key action sequences. First the infiltration of and escape from the ultra-secure Gringotts Bank, where Harry and his friends hope to find one of the pieces of dark wizard Voldemort's fragmented soul. Then a battle royale at Hogwarts, where former students Harry, Hermione, and Ron join their friends, teachers, and other allies to take on Voldemort's ""Death Eater"" minions - and to frantically hunt for and find a way to destroy another Horcrux or two. Finally comes the long-anticipated showdown between the leaders of the respective sides: Voldemort, the most accomplished wizard born in the last century, versus teenaged Harry Potter, who has somehow bested Voldemort on half a dozen prior occasions without ever being able to finish him off. This meeting is of course different than any of their prior encounters, even the one that took place almost 17 years earlier which cost infant Harry's parents their lives. Each side knows that at least one of the two archenemies will not be walking away from this long-prophesied meeting.

In between the action sequences are sprinkled some explanation, a little romance, some attempts at humor that often fall flat, and a little bit of detection. This movie is light on puzzle solving compared to some of the earlier installments. By this time Harry's group has a pretty good idea of where most of the existing Horcruxes are, and it doesn't take long for them to successfully guess where any remaining hidden ones might be. Although the Deathly Hallows - powerful ancient magical adjuncts - provide the story with its name, by the time this final visual chapter of the story opens Harry has realized what his mentor Albus Dumbledore also eventually realized - that to hunt for the Hallows in search of even more power is not the correct path. The Hallows are mainly dangerous and treacherous, and besides that, the goal is not to amass power but to stop Voldemort's murderous ambitions. The Hallows are not the correct tool to use toward achieving that goal. Voldemort himself has provided such a tool by fracturing his soul into multiple parts, the finding and destruction of which (the Horcruxes) will eventually render Voldemort himself mortal.

The romance between Harry's best friends Hermione and Ron has taken forever to get off the ground - largely because of Ron's cluelessness. Somehow he eventually realizes that he likes Hermione, begins to suspect that she might return his interest, and most importantly of all realizes that Harry and Hermione have only a platonic and fraternal friendship and they do not care for each other in that way. Although the long-anticipated kiss between the two cannot possibly live up to expectations, at least it provides resolution. Less successful is the seemingly tacked-on romance between Harry himself and Ron's younger sister Ginny. Where director David Yates and some of his predecessors have really dropped the ball is in failing to develop the Harry-Ginny storyline over the final four movies, in favor of repeatedly hinting at a Harry-Hermione-Ron love triangle and feinting at setting the two best friends up as rivals for Hermione's affections. The result is that it suddenly seems as if Ginny is nothing more than a consolation prize for Harry after he loses out in the Hermione sweepstakes. There is no on-screen spark between Harry and Ginny.

The explanation of events within this film is in somewhat short supply and doesn't always occur at the appropriate time. In particular, when Harry finally defeats Voldemort by commanding the allegiance of the wand that Voldemort is wielding, it is not immediately obvious why the wand would suddenly obligingly leap from the dark wizard's hand and toward Harry. Only in a post-fight explanation does Harry detail the chain of events that had already made Harry the true master of this powerful Elder Wand (one of the Deathly Hallows). There are several other such moments, where devoted readers of the book series can probably fill in what happened or at least should have happened, but where movie-only patrons will be left behind.

On the other hand, viewers who come to the movies mainly from a book perspective may be disconcerted to find that in the film, Harry defeats Voldemort almost in private, rather than in front of all his followers as in the book. That was key, in order to dispel the myth of Voldemort's invincibility. The book's Voldemort died openly, after first having been reduced to his human origins by Harry, who reminded the self-styled Lord Voldemort and his disciples that he is after all only a man once named Tom Riddle. The movie version of these events leaves the witnesses out and also fails to fully demythologize Voldemort. Although Harry does (bizarrely) call Voldemort ""Tom"" in almost chummy fashion at one point, he never spells it out to Voldemort and his followers that he's really just Tom Riddle, a dark wizard who split his soul into too many pieces and killed way too many people.

Another example of a false move is Harry casually destroying the Elder Wand after the battle by snapping it in half. But if the Wand had been that easy to destroy, Dumbledore himself would gladly have performed the deed, since he recognized the extreme danger posed by the Wand and was very alarmed at the prospect of either Harry or Voldemort getting his hands on it.

One aspect of the struggle that was not explored thoroughly enough was the recognition of the sacrifices that many of Harry's allies made. Some were injured in the struggle, others were killed - including some who were extremely close to Harry and his friends. The film could have used some formal recognition of these characters and their contributions.

The extended Harry Potter cast has grown steadily over the years. There are a large number of well-respected and famous actors occupying the adult roles, in addition to the important roles filled by the younger performers. There has never been enough screen time to give all the characters and their portrayers their due, and in this final chapter there is even less than usual as the overriding emphasis is and must be on the epic struggle between Harry and Voldemort. Actors such as Emma Thompson and Maggie Smith are barely on screen at all. One performer who does receive more than a cameo appearance is Helena Bonham Carter, still playing Bellatrix Lestrange, Voldemort's most murderously effective - and demented - lieutenant. The choice of the slightly dotty Bonham Carter to portray Bellatrix was probably the most inspired casting of the whole film series, and it again pays dividends here. Ralph Fiennes had his work cut out for him in trying to act, and to be menacing, while wearing a somewhat goofy snake-man mask. He manages to surmount the difficulties of the task and provide Harry with a serious foe.

But the film ultimately relies on the performances of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron. All three are at least adequate. Grint will not be making the transition to adult film star, but the shortcomings of his character (immaturity and anger) should not be lain at his feet. He succeeds in depicting Ron as well as is reasonable to expect, especially given that he was cast in the role half a lifetime ago. Watson is the film series' breakout star, and she has already achieved success outside the film series, in the world of modeling. Whether she sticks with taking advantage of her striking profile and cheekbones by that route or continues her acting career as well, she seems destined to be a celebrity for a long time.

Daniel Radcliffe, like Grint, will not ever be a conventional adult movie star. He is not tall enough, for one thing. But he was the perfect choice for the role. I can imagine other actors playing Ron and even Hermione. The series lost one excellent actor as Dumbledore and continued with a replacement without a pause. But Daniel Radcliffe took the role of Harry Potter and made it his forever. The story has repeatedly called for Harry to do impulsive, stupid, angry, and unlikeable things (as well as acting heroically and generously at other times of course). Radcliffe's unenviable task was to keep Harry still basically sympathetic throughout even the worst throes of adolescent petulance. He deserves to be lauded for his success in doing so.

The series is over for good, and its like will not soon come along - if ever. The only cure for Potter deprivation is more Potter, and the films, including this one, should have a long lifetime. At some point soon I'll revisit the excellent first movie and then go on from there.",1311638400,8,9483,4.93546365914787
3818858,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a rousing conclusion to the cycle of films. I have not read the books (I'll start soon if I can work through my stack of books) so my review has to do with the film alone. The three principles in the story - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - demonstrate the acting skills that they have picked up over the years and turn in good performances.  The Amazon review noted that there was a lack of chemistry between Harry and Ginny Weasley but there had very little screen time and their characters seems to have taken a back seat to the struggle to defeat Vorldemort and the destruction of the remaining Horcruxes.  The film nicely expresses the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage of the wizards battling the forces of evil. .

It was great to see the many characters played by so many veteran British actors, even if they had only a single scene. John Hurt had a memorable scene describing the characters of different wands and Maggie Smith had a courageous scene displacing Professor Snape as the Headmaster of Hogwarts.  Alan Rickman has a small but effective role in the film and we finally learn Severus Snape's turn feelings toward Harry Potter with his relationship to his mother.  In the end, Snape is the hero that one suspected in watching the films. It would be interesting if J. K. Rowling would write about the generation before Harry, as there is a compelling story to be told.

The final installment of Harry Potter is filled with marvelous special effects, particularly the dragon guarding the vault of in Bellatrix Lestrange labyrinth of Gringotts Bank.  There are some humorous scenes as when Emma Watson impersonates Lestrange with the help of Polly Juice Potion. The only part of the story that was somewhat inexplicable was Harry's death and being brought back to life.  How the Resurrection Stone was used was rather mysterious.  One can't help enjoying the scene where the once timid Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) defies Voldemort.  The epilogue was a nice touch so we could see how enemies had reconciled and life goes on in a new generation.

The final installment of Harry Potter is a memorable film that one can enjoy several times.",1311552000,,2230,4.766233766233766
3818859,5,B001UV4XIS,"Harry Potter is no more, the last instalment has begun for all. this movie was a long and anticipated wait for everyody. this was really good. i was pleased with the movie. there's a couple of things that i wished that the filmmakers would of put in, like hagrid getting attacked, a more epic battle. don't get me wrong the attle was great. but it was more epic in the book. two thing in this movie i wanted to go right was the battle and the epilouge. come on in the epilouge they didn't mention anything aout harry becoming an ora or neviell becoming a professor. but all in all this is the best out of them all. I think J.K. Rowling should do a prelude to the story. i would like to read more about harry's parents when they were young and more depth story on how voldemort became so evil. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1311552000,,848,4.176829268292683
3818860,4,B001UV4XIS,"SPOLERS:  The final battle should have been done closer to the books.  Harry kills LV ALONE in the movie?  And the body DISAPPEARS?!!  How does he even prove LV is dead?  The book ending was better.  Harry explains about the wand and about Snape to LV in front of a crowd and then kills him.  The body remains.  That's the way it should be.  Some of the most dramatic scenes were altered.  Neville killing the snake was better done in the book than the movie.  When everyone thinks Harry is dead, Ginny is the only one upset in the movie.  What?!!!

I still liked the movie, but why take something great (the book) and make it into something average?",1311552000,7,650,4.361344537815126

It is a great movie to watch with your friends, your family, or even by yourself. They gave it great graphics just like the rest of them, but this film has one thing the rest of them don't. It has the intensity of Voldemort throughout the entire film. You finally get to see Harry show his true strength by going at it with Voldemort and all of his minions. They bring out many things in the castle that you have not seen in any other one of the films. In this film you find out who the true bad guys are and who the true good guys are. Of course you would know all of this if you read the books, but it is very different seeing it on screen.
A must see, must own!",1311379200,,779,4.064935064935065
3818862,5,B001UV4XIS,"Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.

The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those ""insufferable know-it-alls"" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)

In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.

The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy. But I don't want to discuss any possible plot spoilers.",1311379200,,1996,4.6647727272727275
3818863,4,B001UV4XIS,"The first ""Deathly Hallows"" movie covered about five hundred pages of the book, while this one covered the remaining two hundred.  But while the first one felt long, but not too long, this one, after a decent start, started to drag.

Why?  Because almost every moment on screen consists of someone trying to murder and/or escape someone else.  After the fiftieth attempt on someone's life, I started wondering why more of the characters didn't just Apparate (magically transport themselves from place to place) rather than jumping into a lake or running helter-skelter.  Also, if someone was chasing you with fire, wouldn't it make sense to recite a counter spell which would invoke lots of water?  This isn't your ordinary action movie, where you have to dive into the air with your arms outstretched in order to keep from getting blown up.

Anyway.  Harry, Ron and Hermione are continuing their search for the seven magical Horcruxes (objects containing parts of Voldemort's soul).  First they must break into Gringotts, a wizard bank, then escape via a cool CGI dragon.  Then it's back to Hogwarts to find the remaining Horcruxes, reunite with the students in Dumbledore's Army and fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

Just like the previous films, there are lots of special effects, ranging from lame to pretty impressive.  Major characters, who the reader/viewer has grown fond of, die and are barely acknowledged, but this was true of the books.  All the actors, even the ones playing the characters' younger selves, do a good job, although Neville (Matthew Lewis) looks alarmingly old.  On the whole, I found HHPatDH Part 2 a solid end to the series but not an outstanding one.",1311292800,2,1686,4.975

Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts where they have the battle of hogwarts and it's awesome! The battle of Hogwarts was done great and it was great to see Hogwarts fighting back and the millions of death eaters all over. They got almost everything in the movie that was in the book! The acting is as always superb. The twist in turns are just as good as in the book and everything is done amazingly. This is my faborite movie now. It goes along at a very fast pace, there is always something going on! WATCH THIS IN THEATERS!!! I saw it at a drive in movie theater in 2D and am going to see it again at a normal one in 3D, because it's THAT Good!! No, the 3D doesn't ruin it, it works AMAZINGLY in 2D. I could go on and on, but you should just see it for yourself.

 SEE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*********SPOILERS AHEAD********:
I feel I need to express comments of spoilers both to the movie and book so watch it first.
Things missing from book: Aberforth did not talk to Harry as much and you didn't learn much about Dumbledore's past. As the movie people say, they're focusing on Harry. And I think Dumbledore talked to Harry more when he went into that dream state thingy.
I just want to say that Snape crying looks very odd. I mean all of the memories are done great, but Snape crying just doesn't look right. XD
Final Fight against Voldemort. Done brilliantly. As well as the whole thing where Harry realizes he is a horcrux and must die.
One thing I would change: Harry hugs Hermione goodbye, but not Ron. WHAT? Oh, well.
At the end I thought it was funny because poor Filtch has to clean up all of the rubble with his broom. XD Couldn't anyone use a little magic to fix it.
Mrs. Weasly killing Bellatrix, YES, they put this part in, people clapped at the drive-in I was at when she died. No one clapped when Voldemort diead, just when Bellatrix dies, because you gotta hate her. Great actor, though.
The epologue was done great with bthe same actors only made look more grown up. Apparently my friend claims Harry's face was a little crooked in the epolouge. XD Umm, if you say so.",1311206400,3,2254,4.298823529411765
3818865,3,B001UV4XIS,"Many have credited J.K. Rowling with reintroducing generations to reading, her clever blend of myths, the supernatural, religious beliefs, and genres, and her remarkable rags to riches story while maintaining her charm and integrity. On the other hand, I also fault her with reviving serials; endless stories about the same characters and making this element an almost crucial requirement of teen literature. There is no Twilight without Harry Potter.

One thing she did pull off, however, is a maturity and growth in her writing as the series progressed. She took one fully realized story and split it into seven increasingly darker (and longer) novels. While I grew tired of the story by the sixth installment and never bothered to read the finale (although I did skim the end just to see who dies), I admire the scope of her vision.

Sadly, the final movie is crushed by the expectations and hype it has generated. The sub-culture of Rowling's amazing creation grew bigger than the story itself. The supremely convoluted plot, crumbling under the sheer number of subplots and frayed strands of characters complete with their own back stories, could not fit easily into a movie, even one that was made into two parts.

I'll admit this; the final movie is everything its predecessor wasn't - fast-paced, action-packed, and entertaining. In all eight of the movies, there was only one where I left the theater in stunned amazement at how boring it was, and that was Part 1 of this two-part finale. In the end, however, I felt no dramatic tension and nothing happened that truly surprised me. In fact, some of the revelations/closures felt cheap and almost laughable. Speaking of, more unfortunately absent is a sense of humor.

In trying to squeeze too much into one film, there proved little room for anything else but a never-ending stream of perplexing explanations, final battles, and hurriedly cauterized plot threads. Everything was life and death serious at the expense of the charm of the first four installments; i.e., the ability to laugh at itself and the knowing wink that we're all part of the fun. The movie theater was funeral silent throughout and it was all my kids and I could do to stifle the need to snicker and chuckle at how ludicrous it all was. Within the first ten minutes or so I almost burst into laughter at the comically serious conversation between Harry and an elf. Has Rowling (with help from George Lucas and CGI) resurrected our culture's obsession with fantasy to the point where I'm supposed to not be amused by the sheer lunacy of it? Am I to accept equally World of Warcraft with The Godfather?

The emotional urgency of the Potter faithful (one word: Trekkie) has become larger than the books or movies. Articles have been written about how the finale is a bittersweet cultural event and that we are all part of the public eulogy for the Potter franchise. Lost in the insane media hype assault and the sheeple consumption of all things Harry Potter is the blunt reality that we are talking about seven books that are at times fun to read but can also get incredibly tedious, which thus spawned seven movies that are generally entertaining but certainly not life-changing. It's a lightweight legend combined with the pain and angst of a teen's diary. In ten years or so, I would hope our society will look back at the past decade and feel pangs of embarrassment at how silly and inconsequential it all seems in hindsight.",1311206400,2,3459,4.836148648648648
3818866,5,B001UV4XIS,"In this superb conclusion to the tale we've been following for over a decade, the intrepid Harry Potter finds that only by satisfying his hankering for Horcruxes can he hope to defeat the dark lord. Most of the film is spent following his search for these last few objects, and what could have been a tedious series of fetch quests is kept from falling into the realms of boredom by a sense of pacing so perfect the future film student in me started taking notes. Admittedly, my last movie experience was Transformers: Dark of the Moon, a ""film"" with such atrociously jarring momentum that I nearly disgorged my five dollar hot dog (but five dollars is five dollars, so I willed it down). Even though anything will seem well-paced by comparison, I haven't been so blown away by such artful interweaving of action and calm, fear and love, and an ensemble cast, since, well, ever.

[Warning: Contains SPOILERS!]

The most powerful example of this is when Harry ends up alone in the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the giant showdown between good and evil. After seeing young students cut down by death eaters as they tried to hold their own in a war that was far beyond them, after witnessing stone statues come to life and make battle with club-wielding giants, after bridges burn, forcefields collapse, and spirits break, after dementors are driven off by those who refuse to relinquish their hope, we find ourselves in a clearing of silence.

Turning the resurrection stone in hand, Harry is suddenly accompanied by the ghosts of those he cares most deeply for: Sirius, Lupin, and his parents. Their undying love for him brought tears to my eyes, for it is a love that continued into the afterlife not thanks to some magic, but because all those who have left us live on in our hearts. The writing was beautiful, the acting sublime. The calm in the center of the storm, this one scene is a masterpiece of pacing.

The rest of the storm was nothing to shake a stick at either, not that shaking a stick at a storm is really that common of an activity. In fact, I'm not sure that it would accomplish much of anything, unless the stick is a wand and you have control over the weather. Then it would definitely help. Anyway, the point of all this is to say that, while the emotional punch packed by Deathly Hallows Part 2 is nothing to shake a wand at, the visuals are equally impressive.

For instance, cast your imagination gaze on Gringotts. Its labyrinthine rollercoaster-tangle transportation system is a wild ride that puts every Six Flags everywhere to shame, especially since it ends with a dragon. Now, a lot of movies have done dragons (Harry Potter included), but this was potentially my favorite CGI beastie ever (don't worry, Toothless. No one can replace you). The dragon was not a glorious mount of yore, but rather an emaciated, abject figure, trapped underground for his natural life, chains cutting into his majesty and leaving nothing but raw, bloody hopelessness. The creature instantly evokes overwhelming pity, something I've rarely witnessed from CGI.

Dragons are basically my favorite, but if there's one thing I love more, it's love itself. We all knew the Ron Hermione romance was going to come to a head. The only question was, after so many years of buildup, could the climax do it justice? I, for one, say that nothing has ever been more just. You know that moment in truth or dare when someone asks you your most seductive fantasy and you finally let spill the secret you've never told anyone? You launch into graphic detail, explaining that it's all about thrusting your basilisk fang into a goblet-shaped Horcrux in the Chamber of Secrets while under attack from a giant watery snake that eventually comes crashes over you? We've all been there. Everybody gives you these weird looks, as if that's somehow not the hottest thing ever. Ron and Hermione certainly thought it was, because they immediately launch into a passionate kiss that had the theater cheering up a storm.

Perhaps the most beautiful scene is the one bathed all in white. Halfway between life and death, Harry finds himself in King's Cross Station, his own personal limbo. There, the sage and mysterious Dumbledore delivers some of the most compelling wisdom in years of cinema. The English major in me rejoiced when such a beloved figure told us that words are the most powerful magic, able to do great harm but also to heal. I'm using words right now, and man do I feel mighty. And when Harry asked ""Is this all just in my head or is it real?"" and Dumbledore responded with ""Of course it's in your head, but that doesn't mean it's not real."" Gah! So sagacious!

But enough nonsensical gushing. As perfect as this movie was (and it was), there were still a few things that I would've done differently. The whole series is about the battle between Harry and Voldemort; this is a showdown ten years in the making, and I wanted it to be perfect. The buildup was there, but when the final blow was dealt, it felt understated. Voldemort simply drifts away into nothingness. If it were me, I'd have Harry explain the entire Deathly Hallows wand switching thing while the two of them struggled against each other, beams of energy locked in a pulsing impasse. Then, as soon as it became clear that Harry was going to win, he'd shout ""Avada Kedavra!"" and Voldemort would EXPLODE. That's how a dark lord goes out.

In fact, I could go for a lot more spell shouting in general. Aberforth Dumbledore should've bellowed ""Expecto Patronum!"" before taking care of all those dementors, and Molly Weasley definitely needed to scream some serious stuff at Bellatrix before the end. And I know it would've gone against the books and fans everywhere would have gone on a David Yates manhunt, but I could've done without that 19 years later scene. I just don't think it works in the film version.

After having been underwhelmed year after year by subpar adaptations of the formative novels of my youth, finally have I received the cinematic experience I've long craved. At long last, we are given epic battles of half-giant proportions, momentous stakes that belie the series' light-hearted origins, and characters whose superb performances tug at our dragon-heart strings. At long last, we have a film that is truly magical.

Score: 5/5 

Also, let it be noted that Neville is a champion.

The battle scenes were awesomely epic. This movie is probably the most emotional, because of a few deaths of characters we've gotten to know over the years, and because it's the final chapter. There was a scene in the middle where I shed a few tears. This movie picks up exactly where Part 1 ended. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still on the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they must try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live. This has been a great decade journey. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2!!!",1311033600,,807,4.611111111111111

Directed by David Yates

The Film 4.5/5

I'm a fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I have read all of the books and own the first seven movies. My favorite in the series is the Prisoner of Azkaban, while I rate Deathly Hallows Part 1 as the weakest entry.

It seems that Part 1 moves slowly and contains too many insignificant scenes. In contrast, this final installment feels a little rushed. It runs about two hours before the credits start to roll and tries to cram in the final showdown, while tying up as many loose ends as possible. Some of the threads are resolved using rather clumsy exposition and deserved more screen time. My final quibble involves the use of quick cuts to increase the sense of action. The story was good enough to do that on its own and I didn't feel that it was necessary to turn some of the scenes into something resembling Bourne.

Although the movie isn't perfect, it's still a fine way to end a thoroughly enjoyable franchise.

I can't imagine that this final entry will be seen by many people who avoided the first seven movies, and that's a good thing. The story picks up right where Part 1 ended and introduces us to many of the characters from the first seven movies. It wouldn't have much impact as a standalone movie and it's not supposed to. I'm interested in seeing the two final parts together to see whether Part 1 works better. In fact, I'll watch all eight movies when the final Blu-ray is released.

The story follows Harry, Ron and Hermione in their search for the remaining horcruxes. The first hunt is a spectacular affair which is heavy on the special effects and action. I'm aware that many viewers will not have read the books, so I'm not going to spoil anything. If you read the final book, you'll be aware of which sequence I'm referring to.

For anyone who complained about the absence of scenes involving Hogwarts in Part 1, much of the action takes place at the school in this concluding part. What struck me is how different Hogwarts looked when we were first introduced to the world of Harry Potter. Gone are the vibrant colors and whimsical interactions with ghosts or paintings. Instead, be prepared to enter a dark setting. I mean that literally as the setting is extremely dim for about 95 percent of the movie; think Gotham City for a comparison.

Another thing that I noticed is how much the acting has improved. The main characters were around 11 years old when the franchise was born, so they are about 21 now. Radcliffe held his own in scenes involving some of the best British character actors of their generation. Watson and Grint played their parts well, and it's a tribute to the original casting that the franchise has developed as well as it has.

It should be noted how important some of the supporting actors are to the success of the franchise. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? His story is one of the most interesting in the series and sees a fitting conclusion. I'm also fond of Maggie Smith's portrayal of McGonagall and love her role in the final installment. You'll see actors that have appeared infrequently given a little recognition, and they deserve it.

I watched the movie with a large audience made up of children and adults into their sixties. Although the sense of evil was always present and the setting was dark, the audience found plenty of scenes worthy of laughter. It's a truly entertaining movie.

The movie might have improved if 30 minutes were added so that everything felt less rushed, but it could have affected the tension if we were given more chances to breathe. The sense of scale reminded me of some of the battles seen in Lord of the Rings. Replace Voldemort's minions with orcs, and there were quite a few similarities.

Fans of the Harry Potter franchise, and I am among them, will be pleased with the way everything is wrapped up. After a disappointment in Part 1, the conclusion was worthy of the story created in the first seven movies. To see who lives, who dies, and what happens to the survivors, you'll have to check it out for yourself. I thoroughly recommend the experience.

The Blu-ray release should be spectacular, despite the grim setting. The explosions and battle scenes will rock your home theater.",1311033600,5,4475,4.640960809102402
3818869,5,B001UV4XIS,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2 deals with Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) coming to terms with the changing nature of the friendships with the people in his life.  Harry fortunately has many people on his side to help him in the battles with Lord Voldemort.  Lord Voldemort and his entourage try to isolate Harry, but it ends up only helping because of the fact that the movie deals with others joining Harry in the quest for a more peaceful environment.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint continue to effectively play his two best friends (Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) that are there to help Harry prevail in restoring harmony to the Hogwarts School.  Many of the actors gave a good performance, but my husband's personal favorite actress was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange (one of Lord Voldemort's trusted servants).  This is because my husband felt that Helena's character of Bellatrix  gave a great performance as an evil and powerful witch with magical powers that kept Harry Potter on his toes with daring supernatural battles.  I can understand where my husband is coming from regarding Helena's superb acting. However, my personal favorite character of this movie was that of Severus Snape (played by Alan Rickman).  Alan Rickman gave an excellent performance as a wizard that is complex and wise. The movie also gives more information as the origins of Severus Snape's persona, and a visual portrait of a teacher that actually means well for Harry.  ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2"" is recommended for anyone that enjoyed watching any of the other Harry Potter movies and/or fantasy films.",1311033600,7,1641,5.048148148148148

3818871,5,B001UV4XIS,"And so here we are, the end of the line. After 10 years and billions of dollars in ticket sales, much critical acclaim and millions upon million of people entertained, we have the final installment in the Harry Potter saga. Is it everything the fans could hope for?

Basically, yes.

The film picks up where last year's film, the aptly-named Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), are all hiding out at a beach house. Dobby the house elf has died and been buried. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), is dead (and despite that state, he still gets more to do here than he did in the recent Doctor Who Christmas special), Snape (Alan Rickman), is in charge of Hogwart's, and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), is on the rise. All is grim and doom for our heroes.

But in typical Potter fashion, Harry doesn't take it lying down. He bribes one of the Gringott's goblins (Warwick Davis, playing one of his two roles in this movie), to help him and his friends get a sword from the vault. This launches them back into the fight and in quick order they've dealt with a dragon, defended Hogwart's (with no small number of deaths on both sides), and everyone, especially Harry, has grown and changed.

I really liked that everyone had something to do in this story. Ron and Hermione get their own little adventure getting a basilisk fang, Snape gets the most character development he's had in the entire series (and proves that, in many ways, he's the real hero of the stories, not Harry), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith, who would make an excellent Granny Weatherwax, should those books ever get made into movies), organizes the Hogwarts defenses in a battle that includes most of the best actors in the UK, including Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, David Thewliss and Miriam Margolyes (who would make an excellent Nanny Ogg, should those books ever get made into movies). Even Draco gets something to do, and proves that he's not an evil little thing like he's been set up to be in the past.

For those of us who were at all concerned that the producers might pull a few punches in order to keep this a ""kids"" movie, worry not. The level of death and destruction is quite high. Everyone that I can recall dying in the book, dies here, some in more spectacular ways than others. The film also does a great job of sustaining an atmosphere of dread and fear, eventually leading to... well, you know what it leads to. Frankly, the make-up job in the end scene got several laughs in my theater, though I thought it was just fine.

I also appreciated the fact that, frankly, this movie flowed better than the book. Much as I liked the novel, it was, as I've mentioned before, a bit of Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip. Here there's none of that. I think the producers made an excellent choice in breaking this up into two separate films. It really benefited the material.

This is usually the part of the review where I say, ""Not everything is perfect,"" but really I can't think of a single thing to complain about. I would definitely recommend against seeing this in 3-D, for what that's worth. All you're going to get is a darker, washed-out version of a movie that already has a fairly dark palette. Don't cheat yourself like that.

The Harry Potter movies and books have been a real cultural triumph and the fact that even the weakest among them have still been better than much of what's out there is no small accomplishment. Kudos to everyone involved for making a truly great series!",1310947200,6,3564,4.628164556962025
3818872,4,B001UV4XIS,"Not having seen all the Harry Potters I went to see this on opening weekend with friends who updated me on part 1 to bring me up to date.

If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 1, or the previous Potters here is what you need to know.  Harry Potter, young wizard with friends, gets into trouble (again) and uses magic to get out (again).  Mortal enemy Voldemort intends to get him and rule the magical world with his evil powers.  He must be stopped before it's too late. His soul is in seven different locations.  Some of these have already been found in part 1.  In order to win against this enemy HP must find all these remaining portions, and destroy them, and in so doing end Voldemort's reign.

Another key character is Snape played by Alan Rickman, who also goes by the name of Severus.  His role in previous movies has been occasional ally, occasional foe.  Here his role will be completely defined, and understood.

Voldemort needs serious plastic surgery, particularly, a nose job, an ear job, and eyebrow implants.  You would think with all his magical powers that he might work some magic on his appearance first, but no!

Not being an HP aficionado, I did enjoy the movie.  We watched in 3D. I think it would be just as enjoyable in 2D.

One thing I enjoyed about the movie were the turns of phrase:

'I want to speak to the goblin.'  We found this quite amusing.

'The wand chooses the wizard.'

'If you ask you will never know.  If you know, you need only ask.'

'If no one alive has ever seen it, then let's ask someone dead.'

'Now is the time to come forward or be destroyed.'  Voldemort.

The deeper you go into the movie the better it gets, as you get drawn into what is particularly Harry Potter, goblins, invisible swords, diodems, as the train pulls out of Hogwarts for the last time.  Finally you get a sense of clarity, and even some unexpected emotion at what happens to key characters.  Those will they, won't they moments. Even those life and death moments.

Obviously, HP has kept the British acting industry employed for several years, and made Emma Watson the world's highest paid actress according to the Guinness Book of Records.

Having seen four of the series, this is the best one I have seen.  The quality of the movie, direction, acting, story is top notch, demonstrates that Britain also can produce not only the James Bond franchise, and Harry Potter, but also many other movies that can rival the best of Hollywood.  Lord of the Rings was made in New Zealand, so it's great to see diversity in filmmaking, not just in Hollywood but all over the world.

You may have noticed that Harry Potter continues its magic ways, conjuring $168 million at the box office on its opening weekend, making it the highest opening weekend ever for any movie, surpassing Dark Knight.  Now that's magic.  I wonder if you found this review helpful.

Will Potter return?  I wpuld not be surprised if there was a spinoff of some kind.",1310947200,5,2956,4.535984848484849

Snape, Hagrid and Dumbledorf a close second. Ron Weasley, Harold Tiberius Potter and Hermione Granger round out the cast of excellence. I say nothing more about this particular movie except that it was great. 4.5 to 5 stars!",1310860800,3,397,4.4520547945205475
3818878,5,B001UV4XIS,"So this is the end of a eight movie long, decade run of films that has somehow managed to not have a stinker in the bunch. With Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the movie series comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Make sure you are up to date on the other movies, especially the last two. You will probably still enjoy it, but you won't know what in the world is going on, other than the fact that Harry and Voldemorte are going to fight by the end.

I'm not a huge fan of what David Yates done directing the last four Harry Potter movies. I liked all the films, but it seems he lacks the ability to give every character the proper amount of screen time and he drains out some of the fun by using a darker looking color for filming, to go along with the much darker material. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 was good, although I found it rather slow, spending too much time with the kids running around in the woods, but it was more of a setup for the chaos that Part 2 delivers.

You want tons of action without sacrificing the emotional connection? Got to love that Snape flashback sequence. Yates got it right this time. I'm having a hard time ranking any of the previous 7 movies ahead of this one. How often can you say that about any long running series? The visuals are better than ever and the musical score is the closest thing to what the great John William's accomplished in the first three Harry Potter films. Most of the cast, roles big and small, are back and it feels almost like we know them personally by now. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown before our eyes sure, but the real magic is in how they have grown as actors. Alan Rickman as Snape is still my favorite character in the series. Nobody could play that part any better. Ralph Fiennes also does an excellent job turning up the menace as the snake nosed Voldemorte.

The movie ends with an epilogue set 19 years later. They re-shot this segment after seeing how silly the old age prosthetics looked on the actors, but the CGI touches they ended up going with were good in being less distracting, though they looked maybe 5-10 years older tops.

It's sad to see this franchise end, but through the power of Blu-ray or whatever muggle invention the future holds, Hogwarts will always be a button or two away.

By the way, I saw it in IMAX 3-D and I don't feel it was worth the extra cash. If it was filmed with IMAX cameras or at least shot in 3-D it would have given Transformers: Dark of the Moon a run for it's 3-D visuals.",1310860800,4,2535,4.30607966457023
3818879,5,B001UV4XIS,"For the sake of perspective, I haven't read the Harry Potter books, and though I have seen all of the movies, I haven't seen any of them more than twice.  I feel like that qualifies me as a non-fan, so I can only judge the film as a general moviegoer.  Having said that, I thought it was an exhilarating couple of hours that provided an epic conclusion (overused phrase, but it fits) to the series.  It was a satisfying, action-packed ending with a few surprising twists and some incredible confrontations.  The climax was thrilling, and for me, the movie overall was more exciting and had a clearer plot structure than Deathly Hallows Part One.  It starts off fairly slowly for about the first half hour, establishing a dark tone that persists throughout the movie, and matches up well with the tone of Part One.  Then, once the plot begins to roll, the film rarely lets up, with intense battles and stunning special effects.  At times, especially the light-hearted moments, you get the feel of the first few movies, but it's basically a very dark, violent fantasy film that is quite different from the series' beginning.  While there will surely be some who are not fully satisfied with every detail of the adaptation, I think most general movie fans will be impressed with the Harry Potter finale.",1310860800,18,1300,4.721238938053097

I saw it Saturday night and boy was it NOT what i expected. Storytelling is great but with this much buildup, you also need EMOTION. I wasn't able to connect to the characters as i was in DH1. Scenes were cut short that were near epic in the book. I consider myself disappointed that this is how it all ends. It's a shame.",1310860800,15,693,4.297709923664122
3818881,5,B001UV4XIS,"""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here.

The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent. The directing by David Yates is excellent. The screenplay (based on J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves is excellent.

The music by Alexandre Desplat is excellent. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra is excellent. The film editing by Mark Day is excellent. The casting by Fiona Weir is excellent. The production design by Stuart Craig is excellent. The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow, Alastair Bullock, Martin Foley, Christian Huband, Molly Hughes, Hattie Storey & Gary Tomkins is excellent. The set decoration by Stephenie McMillian is excellent. The costume design by Jany Temime is excellent. The make-up effects design by Nick Dudman is excellent. The visual effects are excellent.

This is a fitting and well-made conclusion to one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. It is also terrific and entertaining. This is the best movie of the summer and possibly, the best movie of the year.",1310860800,2,1437,4.905349794238683
3818882,5,B001UV4XIS,"In order for the Harry Potter movies to be regarded as a triumph of film-making it was essential that the final movie should be not only a satisfying conclusion, but the best film of the entire series. Happily, it is. This was the movie they got right.

David Yates moves the film along at just the right pace; the action is practically non-stop, but not so frantic that there isn't time to take in what is happening. Steve Kloves provides the best script yet, retaining most of the essence of the book while upping the humor and the dramatic tension of the finale. The acting, especially by the three principals, is the best of any of the movies and although there are relatively few newcomers (Aberforth and the Grey Lady are the only substantial introductions) the stalwarts produce their best work in this film.

There were a couple of things I really appreciated. The deaths, though not glossed over, were indicated subtly rather than in a gruesome manner. Those of the supporters of Harry were really not shown at all, which I thought was well-considered and made this movie much less sombre than might otherwise have been the case; and the deaths of those on the dark side were either off-camera or done in a surreal fashion. That makes this movie much more acceptable for younger viewers (and for this older viewer) than if everything had been shown in gory detail. In addition, the disposal of the final horcrux was done extremely well- in fact, to my mind, rather better than in the book, which relied on a somewhat far-fetched coincidence. Congratulations to those who came up with these ideas and also to J.K. Rowling for accepting them.

There was one part I thought was missed and that was 'the gleam in Dumbledore's eye', which occurred in Book 4 and was the single most speculated-about phrase in the whole series until it was explained in Book 7. Here it is simply omitted, which leaves a gap in the logic of Harry's relationship with Voldemort and its consequences. However, that's a minor matter and those of us who know the books understand why things happened the way they did.

The special effects are magnificent and all the more so because they don't take over the movie. The conflict between good and evil and the choice between the desire for power and the dread of the corruption it brings are concepts based on the characters rather than on the special effects and the characters are always in the forefront in this movie.

No review would be complete without a tribute to Daniel Radcliffe. The whole series depended entirely on Harry being believable, likeable and someone with whom the audience could identify. Important though Ron, Hermione and the supporting cast were, it was with Harry that this series stood or fell. Without ever being guilty of scene-stealing, Daniel Radcliffe brought Harry to life brilliantly and never more so than in this movie. I'll be very disappointed if he isn't recognized by the Academy for a performance amazing in its scope for anyone, let alone someone who first played the role when he was 11 years old.

This was a fitting conclusion to a series which is by far the most successful in the history of film-making. Did they save the best for last? Yes, they did.

A short additional comment on the DVD. While I am not interested in downloading the movie, I am loving the fact that WB is being told in no uncertain terms what it can do with its Ultraviolet streaming system. Power to the people!",1310860800,,3460,4.6996699669967
3818883,5,B001UV4XIS,"Stick a fork in the Harry Potter film franchise or as I like to call it - the Revival of Geriatric British Actors. There's a bittersweet pang because it's all over now, the books and the films and whatever was left of that sense of anticipation. But overriding that is this sense of relief and satisfaction. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II has kept faith with the source material, with the fans, and with fans of good cinema in general. It's a terrific send-off. I'm not saying this is the best film in the franchise; I've got fondness for THE PRISONER OF AZKHABAN and THE GOBLET OF FIRE, but it's damn close.

J.K. Rowling's final book is my least favorite, or, more specifically, the bits in that book that involved wandering the friggin' woods. So you won't be surprised when I say that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART I meandered and moved like molasses for me despite all the terrific character work that went into it. Conversely, PART II is ridiculously fast-paced and, for the most part, focused on the epic Battle of Hogwarts, and it didn't lack for harrowing moments (this is rated PG-13, by the way, and the film handily earns it). PART II picks up very soon after the closing events of PART I, with the death of the house elf Dobby. There's a stillness - or maybe it's hushed anticipation - to these opening scenes as Harry, Hermione, and Ron are caught in temporary respite. But it's only the calm before the storm, and soon enough these three leap back into the fray. Minutes into the film, we witness an audacious heist at the Gringotts Wizarding Bank. The pace doesn't let up after that.

- Harry Potter, to Hermione: ""When have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.""

That right there is indicative of Harry's mindset. And maybe what I've liked best about Harry is that he's clearly not the brains of the outfit (that's Hermione). Harry Potter gets by on sheer pluck and determination, and since I'm no brains either, Harry's qualities are those which I can definitely relate to. You can work your way to being plucky and determined - brains are more problematic to come by. It's been six months since Harry, Hermione, and Ron were last at Hogwarts, and sweeping changes have been effected. There's a palpable repressive mood hanging about. Professor Snape has become headmaster. Harry's allies have hunkered down into this rebellious guerilla unit. The search for the four remaining Horcruxes - enchanted items which house parts of Voldemort's soul - has led our kids back to their school, just in time for the final reckoning. Voldemort, thru his mystical link to Harry, is all too aware that three of the Horcruxes have already been destroyed, and he takes immediate steps to amass his army and lay siege to Hogwarts. There's something fairly awesome in seeing the professors of the houses of Hogwarts combine their mystic arts to invoke a protective spell around the school. The action sequences are granted epic stature, and there's even this gritty HENRY V vibe to the thing. When one invests in seven previous films, these final battle scenes definitely mean something, especially since plenty of the combatants end up paying for it. Hogwarts is demolished.

Was there a lump in your throat, I wonder? The film delivered moments in which I threatened to tear up. But then there are also those ""Hell, yeah!"" moments. It's gratifying to see Maggie Smith let loose as Professor McGonagall. Those familiar with the books are clued in about Neville Longbottom, and he drew some of the biggest applause in the movie theater. But I have to say that my favorite bit of death duel happens between the wicked loony Bellatrix Lestrange and Mrs. Weasley.

I'll have to see this again, and maybe several more times. Partly it's because I know I missed out on some detail, some tidbit I overlooked and, ergo, never got a chance to savor. Partly, it's because I don't quite want to let go yet. How do you follow up on Harry Potter? What, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians? Please. J.K. Rowling had layered in such richness and charm and a sense of spectacle and wonder into Harry's world that it's achieved its own reality, and the movies have conveyed those traits brilliantly onto the screen. The acting, across the board, is superb, with our three teens - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint - holding their own against the vaunted elder thespians (I had a feeling Alan Rickman was gonna be outstanding, and he is). The special effects retain the standard that's been held to this franchise - meaning that it's superb. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II acts as an entirely satisfying, emotionally gripping finale to what has been one of the finest cinematic franchises ever. Well, okay, the epilogue may possibly draw a snicker or two.

Oh, and there isn't enough of Luna Lovegood, dammit. For that bit of neglect, I say to the script writers: ""Furnunculus!""",1310774400,4,4963,4.751740139211137
3818884,4,B001UV4XIS,"I've loved all of the Harry Potter movies (and books.) I think the movies have done an excellent job staying true to the books and cutting out what isn't needed in the movies (mostly with the 4th and 5th one)

The 1st part of the Deathly Hallows was good. It was slow, but the first chunk of the book was too. But I knew that this movie would be exciting and fast-pace. I was crossing fingers hoping it would go out with a bang.

It did.

As always, the acting is just fantastic. All of the actors are so talented. Never once does anything feel sub-par or faked or forced.

The special effects were just...wow. I was impressed with how realistic the dragon was and Nagini looked just as real.

I thought the movie would be depressing. After all, the 7th book was not exactly flowers and rainbows. However, the movie keeps a serious tone, but also throws in comedic lines to lighten the mood.

So, as you can gather, I loved this movie. Why, you may be wondering, only four stars?

Mostly because of how the deaths were handled. Most of the characters haven't been so much as mentioned (in part 1 or this one), so at the end of the first battle, when you see Fred, Lupin and Tonks, if you didn't know who died, you'd be thinking,""What?"" Fred, in this film, only says, ""Yeah."" (In reply to George's question, ""Okay there, Freddie?"") Then you see his dead body and instead of an emotional ending, you're thinking, ""Oh...okay then.""

Also, the effects to make Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny look older could have been better. Harry looks a little bit older and they just put Ron in a fat suit. Besides that, it looks as though they just put on old person clothes and called it good.

But besides that, this movies is amazing. I loved every second of it and it was the ""bang"" I hoped it would be.",1310774400,2,1835,4.450746268656716
3818885,5,B001UV4XIS,"Yes, the title was a bit corny but no matter. I walked into Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 thinking it was going to be like Part 1- Slow and uneventful- I soon found that I was wrong. I was sitting in the theater shushing people if they spoke and telling people to put their phones away when they popped out around me. I loved this film a lot. The action and special effects were just great. The score was just so beautiful that I was dumbfounded by it. And the emotion... oh my God. The emotion in this movie is so great that it compells you to choke up. And then there was that scene from the book, (Minor spoiler here) The Prince's Tale with Severus Snape, that made me choke up a bit. Alan Rickman stole the show. He was just so great with Snape in this movie. Thank you David Yates and Cast for this wonderful gift you have given to my generation. I will be sure to pass it along. Note to Academy: Get that nomination ready. After 1o years of denying Harry Potter it MUST change. Oscar attention must be paid...

3818886,5,B001UV4XIS,"The last installment in the Harry Potter film series, The Deathly Hallows Part Two lives up to the entire Potter filmography.  Everything from the storyline to the action packed scenes between the protagonist and main character Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and antagonist Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), in essence, continuous theme that the story centers upon finding the truth behind Harry's life.  An adventure that has taken Harry from child to young adulthood that has involved his rites of passage as a wizard in a very complex world and all of its complexities.  Viewers who have followed the story through books and films, they too share the experience that Harry and his friends and peers of Hogwarts, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupter Grint) will finally confront by the end of Deathly Hallows, the end of an era but also a beginning.

The film contains a wide array of surprises and predictable moments that may appeal to the diehard Harry Potter fan or those just beginning to be exposed to a cavalcade of excitement that is the Potter experience.  The difference between Part one and Part two, is that although both compliment each other, the latter shows much more of a cohesion and progression of the storyline and the characters that finally come full circle; the last two films appeared to lean much more on the adolescent romantic schmooze between the main characters.  But with Part two, Harry is the central focus as well as a few unassuming moments, especially with underdog, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis). With the effective direction and production and cinematography of the film, these factors contributed to climatic scenes that included an assembly of pyrotechnics that resembled something out of The Lord of the Rings and other fantasized films as well as a massive display of force by a band of mobs from Voldemort's camp against Hogwarts, and the subtle ironic and sentimental scenes in the form of flashbacks that Harry recollects in order to find the truth about himself and what had brought him to his present dilemmas.

By the end of Deathly Hallows Part Two, viewers may have their own conclusion or expectation of the film.  But as a hint, it is the choice that Harry makes that shows much triumph on his part as well as the people that helped him to overcome what had happened in the past.  And the film does not end without a bit of nostalgia, especially as the Harry Potter jingle, that twinkling melody, waivers in the background, that gives a sense of how far Harry, Hermione, and Ron have come since the first film.  Indeed, this may be a farewell to this chapter in the Harry Potter series, but when watching each and every scene, there is a possibility of another chapter in the life and experience of the boy wizard turned adult that has been left open for more adventures to be had, especially fans who have kept that prospect open.",1310774400,2,2890,4.831983805668016
3818887,5,B001UV4XIS,"When all is said and done - when the eye candy special effects of Quidditch matches and fantastical creatures has been superseded by advances in technology in Hollywood blockbusters yet to come - it is the little moments that this viewer and his wife will return to.

When a friend one time bemoaned the fact that `Half-Blood Prince' gets bogged down in pointless hormonal teen-angst instead of getting on with the story, I smiled... and shook my head.

No, I said, that IS the story and it's what I love about the Harry Potter series: it never loses track of the characters. It never forgets that, when viewed as a whole, these eight movies are a story of growing up, of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Of love and friendship and death. Because without those little funny and touching moments between the characters - if all you want is for the movies to rush from one plot element to another - then all you're left with is plot... and no story. Remember: plot is what happens TO the characters; story is what happens AS A RESULT of the characters.

That's the real gorgeous beauty of these movies, and it's what will bring viewers back repeatedly to their DVD shelves. As Frodo said to Sam in `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers': ""What are we fighting for Sam?"" ""That's there's still some good in this world,"" Sam replies, ""and that it's worth fighting for.""

That's why you need those little indulgent moments, because without them it's just razzle-dazzle special effects and set-pieces. Harry and Ginny's first kiss: they're in the Room of Requirement and Ginny tells Harry to close his eyes while she hides Professor Snape's copy of Advanced Potion Making. And before Harry opens his eyes Ginny leans forward, kisses him and whispers, ""That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."" That, my fellow Muggles, is pure movie gold. That's what the characters are fighting for. Love. Yes, the PLOT concerns itself with good triumphing over evil, but that only comes to pass as a result of the STORY which is about friendship. Because that is something worth fighting for.

It's why the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's astonishing trilogy, `His Dark Materials', is an utter failure: `The Golden Compass' movie rushes from one plot element to another: and THEN we go here, and THEN we go there. Never slowing down to allow the characters TO BE characters. What are they fighting for? Well, nothing the viewer could care less about...

Ultimately, all of this success comes about because of the brilliant way in which the author J.K. Rowling has constructed her seven-volume storyline. See, `The Chronicles of Narnia' are good - very good - but in the end don't quite fully succeed, and this is because the author, C.S. Lewis, had never envisioned them as a series: `The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was originally intended by the writer to be a one off. As thoroughly enjoyable as the three Narnia movies are, there is no through-story like Rowling's Harry-Voldermort. Indeed, over the course of the three Narnia movies even some of the Pevensie children themselves become side characters. And although that was entirely the point - part of the plot - in the end it harms the story. It dilutes what the characters are fighting for. It weakens its forcus.

Look at the Harry Potter series: viewed in hindsight it's not just the story of teenage friendships, for it also presents an astounding portrayal of one man coming to be viewed in the end entirely differently by the viewer. Professor Snape. What an astonishing character arc - and yet Rowling had it all there, right from the beginning: Snape using a counter-curse against Professor Quirrell to save Harry during the first movie's Quidditch match. Wait, isn't Snape the bad guy?! We're made to wonder, right from that first movie all the way through to the revelations of the eighth. `Narnia' has nothing on that. It's clear that Rowling has thought her seven-volume story through like a military operation: the first four books may have come out only a year apart, but the author had begun planning them seven years before the first one was ever published.

And the friendships, that's all there too. Look at the Ron-Hermione moments seeded throughout the entire movie series. Harry and Hermione are just good friends, thus all the unself-conscious hugs she gives him. Yet there is a physical tension - a conscious awareness of each other - between her and Ron. At the end of `Chamber of Secrets' Hermione flings her arms around Harry... but, both of them equally awkward and embarrassed, Ron and Hermione only shake hands. In `Prisoner of Askaban' during Hagrid's first lesson with Harry cautiously approaching Buckbeak, Herminone grabs Ron's hand, before quickly letting go, both of them looking around uncomfortably. All, finally, converging in Hermione's emotional outburst at the end of the Yule Ball in `Goblet of Fire' where (like a soul crying out `Look at me!') she says, ""Next time there's a Ball, pluck up the courage to ask me before somebody else does - and not as a last resort!"" And in another moment of movie gold, Harry and Hermione comforting each other on the steps in Hogwarts, unable to be with the one they want. ""How does it feel, Harry, when you see Dean with Ginny?"" After Hermione sends her bird charms crashing into the wall beside Ron and Ron flees, Harry replies, ""It feels like this.""

It's why `Half-Blood Prince' is one of my favourite instalments: not only is it the calm before the storm of the seventh and eighth movies but it allows the characters' friendships to come to fruition. `Half-Blood Prince' does not become sidetracked, far from it. You need that, because that is the story. It's what I love about it: yes, they're wizards and witches but the film makers never lose sight of the fact that they're also young adults going through the most important transitional period of their lives. These movies aren't about fantastical magical events inconveniently interrupted by mushy teenage moments. Instead they're precisely all about those ordinary, everyday teenage moments, played against the backdrop of incredible events. Those amazing events only occur at all because of who the characters are; it's only natural that the plot should play second to the story of their lives. Because they are what truly matters. Because they, as Sam would put it, ""Are worth fighting for.""

As if that wasn't enough, as if the story of Harry-Ron-Hermione (and, indeed, Snape) isn't in itself reason enough to revisit this whole series, Rowling has also given us an amazing supporting cast of characters. All too often in a series, all the characters outwith the main group rarely hold a reader's/viewer's attention for long. And yet Rowling has created not one single boring character, and what an amazing supporting cast they are: the Dursley, the Weasleys, the Malfoys, Hagrid, Dobby, Sirius, Bellatrix, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, and on and on. In fact, one of Rowling's most inspired moves, and certainly a wonderful way of keeping things fresh, was to continuously have a new colourful character each year as the Professor of the Dark Arts. Glideroy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Mad-Eye Moody, Dolores Umbridge. Not to forget the delightful potions master from `Half-Blood Prince', Horace Slughorn, or the Professor of Divination, Trelawney. Then, too, you have the caretaker Argus Filch, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. Well, you get the idea. Quidditch, the Ministry of Magic, the Dementors. The richness of the world Rowling has created is so rewarding that I can't ever imagine tiring of it.

Watching these characters - and, indeed, the actors - grow up before us is fascinating. I love the fact the first two movies are kids movies; there's no hint, really, of what lies ahead. Until, of course, you get to `Prisoner of Askaban'. Even the naysayer film critics sat up at that one and said, ""Hey, hold on a minute..."" From the fifth film onwards these were no longer merely kids' movies. It's what accounts for their immensely broad appeal: children will watch them for the action and special effects, teenagers and adults for the humour and the series' growing depth. Even the opening titles change as the story darkens: from bright gold in the first few movies to chipped and crumbling grey stone.

Viewed as one 1100+ minute &uuml;ber-movie the achievement is nothing short of remarkable.

Thank you, Rowling.

And thank you Warner Bros and the cast and crew for the ten-year visual journey of these marvellous books that you have taken my wife and I on.",1310774400,"1,462",8577,4.885910652920963
3818888,5,B001UV4XIS,"I have to give this film five stars even though I wasn't completely satisfied with it. To be fair when critiquing this film, you need to judge the film on its own merits and not just compare it to the book it was based on. Even though the film adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two"" took many, many, MANY liberties with J.K. Rowling's book, the end result is still a spectacular and entertaining film that really delivers everything audiences have been expecting. It's filled with action, drama, suspense, and an amazing ending to a story that's captured moviegoers' hearts for the past decade.

And then there are the fans of the books. Like me. And although I recognize that ""Deathly Hallows, Part Two"" succeeds as an entertaining movie, there are some things about it that really bugged me.

I understand that things always need to be cut for the film versions of books, and I also realize that filmmakers often change things just to make them a bit more entertaining when they transfer to the big screen. Some of those things I take no issue with (spoilers are ahead, so consider yourselves warned). For example, little things that were changed for the movie (altering Ron and Hermione's big kiss, adding a little Neville and Luna romance, etc.) did not bother me. Other changes actually were for the better (showing the scenes where Ron and Hermione seek out the basilisk's fang and where Neville kills Voldemort's snake), because the audience got to see these moments that were never described in detail in the book.

However, certain things about the movie were changed for absolutely no reason and added no value to the film whatsoever. The thing that annoyed me the most was the way Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix. When Bellatrix died, she sort of shattered like a piece of glass. What was that all about?! And the end sequences with Harry and Voldemort were so different from the way they played out in the novel: still entertaining for the movie version, but different for no apparent reason. I also thought the Fred Weasley death scene was glossed over way too quickly. The way the scene was shown, you didn't even get a good look at Fred's body. Unless people read they book, they may not realize who it was that died. It just did not do them moment justice. I thought that was the problem with a lot of the changes in the movie...and there are many more that I haven't mentioned here. The film tried to make many of these moments ""bigger"" for the movie audiences...more action-packed. But the result was that the scenes lost some of the emotion attached to them, weakening things that were so powerful in the book and making certain aspects of the movie a bit anticlimactic, in my opinion. It was unnecessary and disappointing.

My favorite parts of the movie included the whole Snape pensieve flashback sequence, which was definitely a bit different from the book but was so incredibly well-done that it didn't matter. The epilogue was also fantastic. I was a little worried about how successfully the film's makeup artists would be able to age these young actors to make them look like they were in their 40's, but they did a fantastic job and the final scenes of the movie are absolutely brilliant. (I will say, however, that I wish the film included info about what Harry, Ron, and Hermione were doing in for their professional adult careers. That was something that was entirely omitted from the movie.) I also really loved the way the film included flashbacks from the movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" It was great to see those scenes of the three main characters when they were so young, and then see the amazing young people they've grown up to be.

So, all in all, when viewing the movie just as a movie itself, I give it five stars. It's a very well-done and entertaining film. However, Harry Potter purists like myself may be a bit disappointed that so much of the material from the book was tampered with.",1310688000,13,3969,4.69683908045977
3818889,3,B001UV4XIS,"I must start my review by stating that I love the Harry Potter series,but I,am kind of at a lost when the part 1 is better than the part 2,or when the preceding movie is better than the ending of the series,but this is what is happening here with Deathly Hollows part 2. I must say that this was made so much more apparent as we went to Cinemark Theater in Somerdale N.J.where we had the chance to watch both Part 1 and part 2 back to back in one showing on July 14th. First of all you have so many whys in this film,like why when the writer apparently wanted to vindicate Draco do you let Nevil Longbottom kill Nigani the snake rather than panning up from the legs and let Draco do it to vinicate his evil ways all through the film series. Also Dracos two buddies Crab and Goyle have been there through the whole film series but yet one is missing in this film and no one has said a word as to why hes not there, Dead,left the series,did not want to do it,at least something to tell us where hes at. Then we have professor Snape killed by Voltemolt who tells nigani the snake to finish him,the snake in every other film has eaten its victims but he does not eat Snape,why.
This is the last in this fabulous seres and you would expect tremendous magicical super FX effects but there was more power between Voltemolt and Dumbeldor in the next to last film. The producers had a chance to really show some super fire power like between Snape and McGonagle in the first 20 minutes but its snap ,snap and thats it. The duels between Potter and Voltemolt should have been a drawn out explosion of epic proportions but you see more fire power in the new Smurfs movie, maybe we should have had Gargamal in this instead of Voltemolt doing the fight scenes with Potter.
Then we have the last scene 19 years later where they claim all these characters have children but yet the only one that looks any older is Draco. Where was JK Rowling that she would let this series be filmed like this with so many open ended questions. For all the hype that this movie would be the crowning achievement of the series and the most spectacular special effects I think The Deathly Hollows Part 2 comes up way short and I hope when the dvd is released there certainly is a lot of deleated scenes and an alternate ending because this was a really sad ending to a series that was hyped and hyped and hyped..The only high point in this film is we get to see professor sprout,maybe they should have let professor Sprout milk the mandrake plants for a solution that could bring this film back from being petrified....

I've been with the Potter series since someone (I can't remember who) told me to watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"". I loved it. I watched ""Chamber"" as soon as it came out and loved that also.
Then came the books and there you go...another devoted Potter fanatic.

And we come at last to the final movie...(sniffle).
The good?
Everything....everything that really mattered from the last half of the book was included.
An amazing translation.

Beautiful direction.
FX are amazing.
The score is gorgeous.
My only advice is bring tissue...there was a lot of crying going on around me and I had to bite my bottom lip REALLY hard in a few parts to keep my own tears in check.

Any complaints?
Yes...it's over. :(
It was a brilliant movie, the perfect send off but I'm already sad.
It's such a rich and wonderful universe I don't want it to end.
I really hope JK decides to revisit this world again some day.

All in all....genius.
If you're new to the Potter world this probably isn't the place to start, start with the first one and work your way up, you'll be so happy you did.

And lastly,
It's been a joy and a pleasure to see these actors grow up right before our eyes.
They've all turned into fine actors and I wish them the best in the future no matter what they decide to pursue.
I think like a lot of you I'll be doing a Potter marathon this weekend.
Oh and I saw it in 2d not 3D and the 2d was still amazing.
