This is part of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sci-Fi-Fever-20-Film-Collection/dp/B00FPWWCCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sci-Fi Fever - 20 Film Collection</a>&nbsp;which I had purchased a week earlier and is available in three DVD discs.

What's campier than a Spaghetti Western?  Spaghetti Science Fiction, of course.  What's the difference?  Special, or in this case, not-so-special effects.

We've got a container ship heading into NY harbor loaded with alien eggs, which, when warm erupt and spew spores which cause men to explode.

There's a lot of similarities between Aliens and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  The acting is a two on a five, maybe even 10 scale.  The video is washed out.  As I did I the review of the collection discs, no subtitles.  The special effects are on par with those of the original Star Trek.",1482969600,,912,5.681481481481481
8514018,1,B007BOCCD6,"This is a fairly lame Italian sc-fi film with bad special effects and a bad plot. It borders on campy, but doesn't cross the line often enough to make the film a cult classic. Instead it is a dud. Louise Marleau plays a very young Col. Stella Holmes. She doesn't like to be called ""baby"" but enjoys a good smack to the face. (Italian film give away.) Exploding head alien eggs are discovered on a coffee ship from South America. Our colonel recalls an astronaut who returned from a Mars mission talk about such eggs and drew pictures of them, because taking a camera to Mars wouldn't make any sense.

Eventually they travel to South America to find the source of the contaminated coffee.

There are better and campier Italian sc-fi films. This one didn't make it for me in either category. You might want to keep the remote handy.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1365465600,,875,4.560509554140127
