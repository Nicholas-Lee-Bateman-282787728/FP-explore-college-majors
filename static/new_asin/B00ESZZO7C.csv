8609118,3,B00ESZZO7C,"Dommsday Castle is National Geogrpahic CHannel foray into what it would take in the end times and one man's journy into what it will take  for him and his entire family to compelte his castle.  Literally a castle.  Started in 1998 and with the walls done he's decidced to gather five of his ten children to finish what he think will be the single thing to keep them all safe and secure when the world collapses.
  This series follows what they do when the build fortifcations, traps even weapons to keep the premiter safe from those that are more then willing to take it.  They learn how to make reusable energy and become self sustaining with thier food stores.  They even have to deal with issues among themselves.
  All in all this series of episodes while interesting to watch is nothing  speical.  This only lasted eight episodes and I felt that while this gave the viewers some ideas as to what they can do to prepare for ""The End Times"" as the patriarch of the family keeps saying.  It could have been more with a longer run.  But as it was only eight episodes that ran and eight shall ever be.  So take it for what it is a doomsday prepper with a castle.",1423440000,4,1162,4.369158878504673

8609120,4,B00ESZZO7C,"There are definitely some good practical principles shared in this series.  The downside is that some of the preps are a little extreme, probably for television.  If you can read between the lines of family drama and excess, I think you'll find some cool ideas and good reminds of what's need in a grid-down (shtf) scenario.",1390089600,3,324,4.767857142857143
8609121,4,B00ESZZO7C,"The show is Great.

My only beef is with NAT GEO.

Why do these idiots ONLY make DVDs?

I want a Blu-Ray of Doomsday Preppers, Castle, & Bunkers.

Not DVDs.",1386115200,3,156,4.1
