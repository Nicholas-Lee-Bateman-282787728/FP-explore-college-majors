7863244,5,6304123701,"MATERNAL INSTINCT stars Delta Burke as Tracy Horton, a woman desperate to have a baby. Even her husband is amazed by her zealous pre-planning. Alas, doctors discover that Tracy has a cancerous ovary, and must perform an emergency hysterectomy. Tracy... doesn't take the news very well. Soon, those responsible for her now-barren condition, including her pregnant doctor, are on Tracy's enemy's list, and they're in for a vengeful onslaught, fueled by bitter rage! Yep, Tracy's slipped quite a few gears, and not even her husband is safe! Fans of Ms. Burke should love seeing her so unhinged, wreaking havoc and going berserk in a bathroom stall! She plays her lethally loony role w/ gusto, adding a lot of fun to this maniacal sub-genre. Her cold, calculated destruction of Dr. Eva Warden's (Beth Broderick) life is delectably eeevil! The final, wrench-swinging showdown slaps the icing on this cake, good and proper! Utter Fan-tab-u-lous-ness!...",1454198400,,947,5.2368421052631575
7863245,3,6304123701,"After undergoing an emergency hysterectomy, Tracy Horton wakes up to realize that her life as she knows it is over. Tracy had always dreamed of having a family, and now her dream is dead. Because her life is over, she vows to make life miserable for the people responsible, including Dr. Eva Warden, who performed the surgery (played by Beth Broderick, better known as Sabrina The Teenage Witch's aunt) and Tracy's own friends who consented to the surgery. In a hilarious turn of events, Tracy begins her revenge plot by switching the now pregnant Dr. Warden's progesterone with cooking oil, switching pregnancy tests in the doctor's office, and using her friends' business to get back at Dr. Warden's husband.

I have no problem admitting that I love Lifetime movies, and this one is one of my favorites. It's kind of like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hand-That-Rocks-the-Cradle/dp/6305213305/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conspiracy-Theory/dp/6304708793/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conspiracy Theory</a>. Tracy really does believe that she's been targeted by the doctor and cannot imagine that she was just a victim of circumstance. In her mind, the hysterectomy was no accident, and the people responsible have to pay. That kind of delusional behavior is so much fun to watch, particularly when you have Delta Burke playing the lead. This movie is hilarious and a great time when you're in the mood for a laugh. True, I'm sure it was meant in all seriousness, but when you watch the movie you'll realize why you have to laugh at it. Watch Maternal Instincts when you have time to kick back and enjoy yourself, but don't expect great cinema. It is only Lifetime after all.",1215302400,,1841,5.718978102189781
7863246,4,6304123701,"When this movie came on TV this week (Lifetime Movie Network) I was very excited to finally see Delta in action. And she does not disappoint. Delta is a true Drama-Queen if ever there was one.

Although, I wasn't exactly sure what the movie was about. (The description on TV Guide is horrid and these other nimrods on Am@zon do not know how to write a review.) So, for the first maybe 20 minutes of the movie, I was more or less routing for Delta. Please allow me to be the first to inform you, this movie is: DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!

Here are the main characters of this TV movie:
Tracy Horton (the ~ Star ~ , Delta, of course)
Dr. Eva Warden (Beth Broderick)
Gary Warden (Garwin Sanford)
Sabrina (Sandra Nelson)

I quickly learned that Tracy was just a total whack-job who took pleasure out of being as malicious and devious as possible. Picture the very worst of Kimberly (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose/dp/B000UAE7UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose</a>, of course) and the very best of Cartman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B00023P49C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>) and there she is! It was like watching Freddy Krueger run around in sensible Lane Bryant outfits!

The plot of this movie is rather similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hand-That-Rocks-the-Cradle/dp/6305213305/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>. Tracy who works as a pediatric nurse, will stop at nothing to have a baby. Unfortunately after several attempts, she still cannot conceive. However, Tracy does not give up because having a baby really means more than life itself to her.

After being hospitalized for an emergency procedure it is revealed that Tracy has cancer. OK, this is where it gets weird. I'm no medical expert, but how can cancer be detected that quickly? And, how can it be ""cured"" that quickly? While Tracy is under, Dr. Warden tells her husband that if she has surgery all will be fine. Like I said, I just don't get this. But I guess that's what makes a TV movie...!

Anywho, after Tracy comes out of surgery her doctor informs her that she will never be able to have kids! Tracy goes nuts! But, this is another aspect of the movie that is perplexing. After thinking about it, I think that Tracy was always pathological. She didn't just turn crazy once she got the bad news. (I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."")

I especially loved that temper-tantrum Tracy had on her hubby as she dramatically threw the baby basinet across the room! It was so funny and over-the-top!! There was so much hate and malice in Delta's eyes.

Soon after ""being cured"" Tracy finds out that her hubby made the final decision to go ahead with the emergency surgery which prompts her to flip out on him! She actually kills him! And, again, this is another aspect that I didn't fully grasp. Was it criminal or was it accidental? I believe for the most part it was criminal, because as I described, Tracy was a total lunatic!

After her husband's death (BTW, I loved how she looked at the funeral with the dark glasses and oversized scarf; nice touch!) Tracy decides to ruin Dr. Warden's life! She breaks into Dr. Warden's home and switches her fertility medicine (she's also trying to have a kid) with olive oil! Then she gets a job working at Dr. Warden's medical lab!

Now things really begin to cook! I really enjoyed the part when Dr. Warden came to the lab with her hubby (after they found out that there was oil in her stash of medicine.) Because Tracy just scampered out of the office, so no one would recognize her! So funny!

Tracy also switches all of the medical records for Dr. Warden's patients. Now that her trouble was caused, Tracy goes to work for her good friend, Sabrina, who's a building developer; who's conveniently doing business with Gary (Dr. Warden's hubby.) Oh, and once Sabrina catches on to Tracy's game, this kook kills her!

It was incredibly foul (and even somewhat unrealistic) when Tracy hid behind a pillar and heaved a huge pile of carts at an unsuspecting Dr. Warden. All you see are these carts coming at her as she's in the middle of a shopping center parking lot. And when the carts hit her, Tracy simply scampers off with a broad (and devilish) smile on her face!

Tracy finally gets around to her business with Dr. Warden's hubby, which causes them to go out of town, together. Of course, he doesn't know that she was his wife's former patient. On the business trip, Tracy tries to seduce Gary (for an old dude, he's not bad, but I'm sure she wasn't attracted to him.) Tracy says something like, ""you're just such a good-looking man."" But Tracy was getting no pickle-tickle from Gary Warden! He was repelled by her!

...The next day when they visit the land, it really turns funny (and somewhat shocking and ugly!) Tracy goes totally off the deep end and drives through a field trying to run down Gary! She finally hits him! ...The next scene is even more outrageous!!! Dr. Warden's doorbell is ringing, incessantly. When she goes to answer it, her half-dead hubby falls into the doorframe! How much more dramatic and ridiculous can you get!

Tracy then (conveniently) decides to go back to work as a pediatric nurse, just as Dr. Warden goes into emergency labor (thanks to all the mischief that Tracy caused.) The rest of the movie is rather predictable, but just as over-the-top and in-your-face!

Good job Delta, you really outdid yourself! And, both Beth Broderick and Garwin Sanford provided very fine supporting roles. They were very convincing as the harried and terrified couple who just wanted to find a little peace and happiness.

If you enjoyed this movie, I also highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-Devil/dp/B00005N89S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She-Devil</a>&nbsp;with Roseanne Barr. And, I also highly recommend the TV movie, ""Empty Cradle"" staring Kate Jackson and Lori Loughlin. Unfortunately this movie is not on DVD (or VHS) and likely will never be; however, it does come on Lifetime Movie Network from time to time (I understand it will be shown this Thursday!)

I don't know if you follow Delta Burke? It was just announced recently that Delta is seeking outside professional psychiatric help! According to E! News, ""she needed help sorting out the anti-anxiety medications she'd been taking to keep her condition under control."" Miss Delta is in my thoughts and prayers for a swift and speedy recovery. I wish Delta all the best!",1203811200,6,6691,5.094977168949772
7863247,3,6304123701,"I give this movie 3 stars.  Delta Burke plays a woman who is troubled by the idea that she may not be able to have children.  She visits a fertility specialist to seek a cure.  Dr. Eva Warden examines her and finds cancer in her overy.  She consults her husband, who gives consent for a complete historectomy.

  Tracy wakes to find that her dream of a child is gone forever.  Something in her mind snaps and she begins killing off the people involved one by one.  Her last target is Dr. Warden herself.  Using any plan she can, she is attempting to destroy her life and steal her baby.

  She even lures Dr. Wardens husband off on what he thinks is a job and plans to kill him.

  This is a pretty good edge-of-your-seat thriller that keeps you wondering what will happen next.",1151971200,,778,4.335664335664336
7863248,4,6304123701,"Yeah, I agree with mostly everyone else in saying that Beth Broderick kicked serious butt in this movie, but Delta Burke was a bit I don't know, just not fit for her part I guess. The plot was cool, but predictable. Somewhat predictable any ways. The only reason I liked this movie so much is because I write stories like that a lot. (Having to do with some one doing something that causes that second person to seek havoc apon them) So yeah.",1063324800,2,442,4.337349397590361
7863249,1,6304123701,"The story of a woman desperate to have a baby and getting an emergency hysterectomy without her consent instead was extremely compelling. The big problem with this movie is that they turned a very good idea into a pretty cheesy horror/murder flick that was so unrealistic, it bordered on comedy. I had been looking forward to an intelligent portrayal of how a person might react to such a tragic situation. Turning the victim psycho was a dissappointing cop out that I could have tolerated had the portrayal been more realistic and better acted.",1050019200,,545,4.870967741935484
7863250,3,6304123701,"This is a good film, but mostely because Beth Broderick is great in her role as Dr. Eva Warden. The other actors and actresses does a good job too, but Broderick shines a little more. The story is pretty typical and give no suprises and the writing and directing are stable but not anything near oustanding.",1008460800,2,307,4.5
