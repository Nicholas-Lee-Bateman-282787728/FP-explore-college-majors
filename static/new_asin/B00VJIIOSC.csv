7090588,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Leslie is great, good workout",1433462400,2,29,5.0
7090589,5,B00VJIIOSC,I just received my video today and the toning and walking combination is awesome.  I have several of Leslie's videos and this is my new favorite!,1433462400,3,145,4.576923076923077
7090590,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have been walking with Leslie for a few years and lost 35 lbs. I love how this new DVD incorporates weights and walking. This is the workout I have been waiting for! I did the full hour (upper body, lower body and fast walk) and I am feeling it! If you don't like squats and lunges, don't buy this DVD. If you can handle the challenge, I highly recommend this workout! This DVD will be in my weekly rotation.",1433376000,4,410,4.1375
7090591,4,B00VJIIOSC,"She is getting it - do circuits....the only drawback is that the circuits were not a HITT or interval type of circuit (sort of like her 5 Big Miles dvd where the stretchie segments were split up into upper and lower in between miles....).  I definitely wanted to go the dumbbell route - the stretchies had me burned out.  So I think she is headed in the right direction.

The other reviewers have done a good job summarizing the dvd.  TIP - I upped my weight load to get both the burn and the sweat....think 10, 12.5 and 15lbs to start - I was sweating afterwards.... I will probably push for 12.5, 15 and 20lbs since the pace helps to support that weight load - the cool thing is that the pace is slow enough to go really heavy as you build strength.... my opinion - 3 and 5lbs weights will not create a cardio effect - in this type of workout you have to challenge yourself a bit in your weight load.  I will say that I have Bowflex adjustment dumbbells that helps me with having variety.",1433289600,7,990,4.24468085106383
7090592,5,B00VJIIOSC,perfection as always! i  love working out with Leslie she is so perky and makes it interesting since i started the Leslie workouts i have lost a total of 205 pounds! The entire class looked like they were having the time of their lives all 3 sessions are easy enough to follow and just the right amount of intensity this is my new favorite workout thanks Leslie xoxo,1433289600,7,366,4.382352941176471
7090593,4,B00VJIIOSC,"I am fitness DVD obsessed, and Leslie is one of my favorites for low impact days.  I really applaud Leslie for keeping up with the latest fitness trends.  Circuit training is really popular right now because it's so time efficient & effective (most of the exercises I do are circuits with Jillian Michaels' DVDs).

The upper body & lower body circuits are good; Leslie incorporates classic strength training moves (biceps curls, chest presses, chest flyes, squats, lunges, etc.) that really works on toning.  If the moves are too easy or too hard for you, you can easily just increase or decrease your weights.  The fast walk was just ok to me; I think I would've enjoyed it more if Leslie created a core circuit instead with more abdominal work involved.

I also think it would've been nice if this DVD came with a recommended workout schedule (example: Monday upper body, Tuesday lower body, Wednesday fast walk, Thursday play all--something like that).

Leslie is her usual bubbly self; as always very motivating.  The style of this DVD is definitely different from her previous DVDs (no more miles!), but doesn't mean that it's not as effective. I know some of Leslie's long time fans may be disappointed because of the changes in her walking workouts, but just look at it as an evolution; Leslie has to keep evolving & involve different fitness techniques, otherwise what's the point of creating new DVDs?  ",1433289600,100,1412,4.870292887029288
7090594,5,B00VJIIOSC,Really love Leslie Sansone videos.  Got this one yesterday.  I did it first time today.  I really loved it.  I love how this is strength training with cardio.  Plan on doing it three times a week with a long walk on the in between.  Highly recommend,1433289600,5,249,4.304347826086956
7090595,3,B00VJIIOSC,"The fast mile has all the traditional moves of Leslie's walk program.  The other 2 segments - the toning segments - were not what I thought they would be.  There is some walking but the toning parts are done while standing still or lying down. You tone for a few minutes then walk a few minutes then tone again.  You can't program the segments (like you could in the 10 minute Walk Blasters DVD) so that you do the fast walk first, then the upper body, etc., but you can play any segment that you choose.  Had I known that the toning parts were not done while walking, I would not have gotten this DVD.  I did all three segments (although I walked through some of the toning segments such as the lunges which didn't agree with my joint issues) the first day I got the tape and I didn't have much of a sweat when I finished.",1433289600,40,823,4.1835443037974684
7090596,4,B00VJIIOSC,"**DVD Menu**

Play All ( With the option of music only)
Circuit 1 - Walk & Upper Body ( With the option of music only)
Circuit 2 - Walk & Lower Body ( With the option of music only)
Circuit 3 - Fast Walk ( With the option of music only)

One thing I noticed is that she's sort of moving away from her traditional mile-structured workouts. There is no time clock in this. There are various new faces of people as well as those you'll recognize, such as Suzy, Marvin, and Janet from Walk To the Hits. Wendy from Five Mega Miles, Carrie from various workouts like her colorful miles, 3 mega miles, and 4-mile power walk. And Nick, the guy always smiling so big. The music is okay. Some of it was awkward, but half of it were some I recognize from her very old DVDs. Her voice and the music balance well together.

**Circuit 1**
You immediately start up with a fast warm-up, and I say fast becuase it was already fast-pace. Maybe it wasn't even a warm-up. You then move on to upper body sculpt. I would suggest stay within 3 to 5 pound weights. If you're used to weightlifting, go ahead and bump it up. But I had to switch between sets becuase she tired me out. I have to admit, I didn't think she'd really have me tired because her sculpt videos are not that strong. But I believe this surpasses her Firm 30. Afterward, you return to a 2 to 3-minute fast walk, and then you get on the ground and do some more sculpt on the mat. Afterward, there's one more fast walk. But there is no cool down. I burned 83 calories through this.

**Circuit 2**
It's pretty much the same as Circuit 1, only you're doing lower body sculpt. That means lunges and squats, along with staying at the bottom and pulsing for about four seconds. Those really hurt. You don't get on the floor in this. At the very last round, she'll have you doing those squats and lunges again without weights. I burned 88 calories.

**Circuit 3**
All it is, is a fast walk. There's no jumping or jogging. But there are shifts. Just one round of it with a side-punch. Toward the end, she'll play around and introduce all the walkers. I honestly, couldn't help but smile. However, there is no stretch at the end. She said she'll leave that up to you. I burned 115 calories.

Overall, I think it could have been better organized. What I didn't like was her being off step a lot. Scenes would change and all of the sudden, people are not going with the music, or she changed her step without you knowing. But I was very impressed with the arm toning. I just wish it was a little longer. But I've been a walker for a long time now. So, I pretty much collect almost ever DVD she releases.",1433203200,244,2637,4.264
7090597,4,B00VJIIOSC,I start off by writing that I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone.  I love how sweet she seems and it's like working out with a good friend.  Her fellow walkers are just like her. I've been walking now steadily for over six months and I have easily lost over 40 pounds doing these walks.  The walks are great to do and easy on the joints and you aren't yelled at like some other instructors do.  I was anticipating the arrival of this newest dvd.  Her other dvd's are great but I wanted something with weights and this does not disappoint.  I did the full hour and I feel like it did the trick.  Fine addition to the collection!!!,1433203200,192,625,4.158333333333333

7090604,5,B00VJIIOSC,"We have four of the Leslie Sansone workout DVD's.  We really like them, and swap them up often.  The Tone every Zone spends a good bit of time strength training the arms and legs.  Most of her videos are walking.",1528070400,,212,4.25
7090605,5,B00VJIIOSC,"As a lady who has bone spurs on both heels from overdoing it at the gym previously, I can say Leslie's DVDs still allow me to be active on a low impact level and not hurt myself..I was doing them a while back and I have returned...I don't want to walk with anyone else..Leslie for life...",1527638400,,288,4.160714285714286

7090614,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Amazing split section workout.. I've been doing Leslie's workout for a very long time and her workout videos do work to loose weight.. every time I need to loose some pounds I go back to the walk away the pounds dvds and use them in different days..  I  own quite a few so I choose a DVD depending on my training schedule or time I have.. my favorite is the burn to the beat I love it after  the workout there is a bonus section for core which targets all abs, I  combine that with this tone every zone and is the perfect workout for the week.. also I eat healthy balance meals I cut down my dairy, bread and sugar consumption by half and stay away from process food which is the biggest culprit in food and one of the major cause of stomach problems and weight gain..",1526169600,2,768,4.134228187919463

7090620,5,B00VJIIOSC,This DVD is awesome in that it is a tool to help you do weight training.  It is low impact in addition to the walking.,1523318400,,118,3.72
7090621,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I like doing these workouts, they make me feel like I have accomplished something.  I usually have to take it a bit easier than what the leader is doing but it's pretty easy to adapt.  And I can do it in my little living room.  I like to change workouts often so I have been adding more of these walk videos to my library.  You won't be sorry.",1522627200,,343,4.0
7090622,5,B00VJIIOSC,This is one of my favorites I think.  Toning is something I rarely do so I got this to help with that. I love the walk/tone/walk/tone set up. Definitely a great dvd.,1521590400,,165,4.15625

7090628,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Love all of the Leslie Sansone videos--always a great workout including both aerobics and weight exercises.
However, this video does include some mat exercises, which I find a little hard to fit into my very limited exercise space.  Also, it is hard to watch the video on my computer screen while lying on the floor.  So--I love this video, but would like some alternative exercises for those who find it inconvenient to use a mat.",1520294400,,431,4.733333333333333

7090634,4,B00VJIIOSC,"I like the upper body segment and I don't mind that the lower body segment is just squats.  I think the walks themselves are good lower body toning.  I haven't done the last workout yet, I keep going back to the first two.",1518134400,,222,4.1395348837209305

7090636,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I love this dvd. The three 20 minute sessions focus on upper body, lower body and just walking. The pace is rather quick during the aerobic part of the upper body and lower body so it might be tough for a person just starting out or someone who has not exercised in a while. Miles are not measured in this dvd so if that is what you want then you should try one of the others.",1517097600,,376,3.960526315789474
7090637,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Love this work out!  I have been exercising avidly for 30+ years. I have quite a collection of fitness dvd's and this is my new favorite.  I feel this in my arms, back, and rear .  This is simple but with lots of slow reps so you can do the moves right.  Especially love the instruction during the lunge portion. DVD is divided into 3, 20 minute segments: upper body strength training, lower body and fast walk .  I feel this has really increased my metabolism.  I like a fitNess class that gives me a workout but isn't so hard I dread doing it. This is perfect!",1516752000,3,562,4.205607476635514
7090638,5,B00VJIIOSC,Excellent as all her DVD's are.  We use them at a church aerobics class and get a super work out.  I'm 74 and there are two 78 year old women who go and we all do the 2 miles.  Occasionally I do the 3.  But with the weights we get a good workout.,1515801600,2,246,3.5849056603773586

Why the 4 stars? Because ""the twins"" are distracting, with one (3rd workout) in the yellow shoes looking extremely lazy and not putting any energy into the final routine. Her lack-luster performance (not raising arms, barely moving) is distracting.

This is my first Leslie Sansone video, and I must say I find her to be a great Instructor! She's got just the right combination of humor and intensity. Love her personality, and the production of the video was excellent. Just as a reference, I am a Dance Instructor,  so I work out at a fairly high intensity about 5 days a week. This is the type of workout that you can do at your own pace, whether you're just starting out on a fitness plan, or you have a fitness plan in place and need to add something new.

7090677,5,B00VJIIOSC,Did all of this DVD today.. I like that u can keep challenging yourself with the toning by using heavier weights or resistance bands.  I did work up a good sweat and will probably use this on the weekends..,1503792000,,206,4.282051282051282

I will only buy HER products because they WORK for me consistently, I have lost weight, toned and kept it off with the use of her products. She definitely knows what she is doing, her tapes/dvd's are fun, especially the one's you can mix and match, and I am never bored. She stays on top of things, and always brings you the latest moves and techniques. She was on QVC for a while, but I haven't seen her on there lately. It's okay though, as long as Amazon carries her products, I'm good!",1503187200,3,642,4.227642276422764

7090695,5,B00VJIIOSC,Already hooked on Ms. Sansone and her walking dvds. She adds light weights in this program. I never realized how important strength training is. I only use 3# weights and I get a great workout. I am a 69 year old female. It's never too late!,1500508800,4,241,4.260869565217392

7090697,4,B00VJIIOSC,"This is a great workout if your just starting out and want to incorporate some strength training into your workout. Very simple basic strength training exercises like lunges and squats for lower body and bicep curls, tricep, shoulder and chest extensions for upper body, all while doing upbeat walking segments in between. Not complicated to follow and not over doing it. I think it is  just right for getting back into strength training and just moving. It's low impact, no jumping which is why I really purchased it due to mild plantar faciitis in my heel and a mild calve injury, no problem or pain for me! The only reason why it's four stars and not five is that I really wish she included a short stretching segment for the end of the workout. She does a cool down but no stretching. Overall, I really liked it!!!",1500076800,,818,4.5646258503401365

7090706,5,B00VJIIOSC,I will say that if you are advanced with working out these are probably not for you. But I will say for me I am still over 100 pounds over weight. I have lost 16.5 pounds so far using a few different Leslie dvds and eating right and taking a 30 minute walks on most week nights when I can. This one is a little challenging for me because it isn't all walking it's also strength training. There are a lot of squats and lunges in the lower body section. So if you cannot do those then this one will not be right for you.  I will also say Leslie is also slightly annoying at times to me. But it's nothing I cant handle. With certain dvds you can choose the option to walk with just music but I do not really like to do that because then I do not know what's coming next and I get slightly behind for a second. Other than that I feel like it is a good work out for me. If you aren't sure just try it. They are relatively inexpensive to buy the dvds.,1496016000,13,945,3.921875
7090707,4,B00VJIIOSC,I really wanted to love this. The strength training is awesome but the music was a little off. At times it was if they were all out of sync due to the music.,1496016000,,157,3.787878787878788

7090718,3,B00VJIIOSC,"The upper and lower body workout is good.  It gets the heart rate up. Unlike other dvd that I have this one does not provide an option to do all three segments at once.

7090720,5,B00VJIIOSC,I like this tape because I can do any of the 3 segments if I just want a quick 20 minute walk and depending upon the mood I am in to work can choose accordingly.  You won't go wrong with Leslie!,1494374400,3,194,3.731707317073171

7090756,5,B00VJIIOSC,Our exercise class loves this DVD.  We use several of her DVDs and this is our new favorite.  We like using the weights and all find it to be a challenging workout.  Its a good change from the bands.  We are a group of retired seniors in Hawaii and we use a video once a week because we can't secure a teacher.  Leslie is a wonderful substitute and many of us feel we get a better workout with her. Her routine is easy to modify.,1490313600,3,429,4.0

7090793,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Nice mix of cardio and strength training basics. Especially good for those new to strength training. This has 3 -20 minute segments. Upper body strength/cardio circuit, legs/cardio circuit and a final cardio only segment.  She is pleasant, easy to follow and encourages you to go at your own pace. There's no goofy or awkward dance moves to trip you up and the strength circuits can be made harder or easier depending on the weights you choose. The cardio section can also be boosted by jogging or bumping up the impact a bit.

 I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy and this gives me a decent low impact but moderately paced workout that I should be able to do through pregnancy and beyond. I mix this in a few times a week with other low impact cardio and always feel like I've gotten a good workout. I'd recommend this to anyone trying to get in shape that needs low impact exercise for whatever reason. She has never great about having stretching segments in any of her workouts and I was disappointed that she also didn't really include one here either. There may be 2 minutes of a pretty sad stretch at the very end so I follow up with at least 10 minutes of yoga based stretching after.",1484352000,,1195,4.497695852534562

7090838,5,B00VJIIOSC,I love these gym shoes. I normally wear a size 10M but with this shoe based on other reviews I went one size up to 11M. I do a lot of walking and walking dvds at home and it was really hard for me to find the right shoes. I tried so many different styles and sizes and finally found these and bought 2 pair already.,1475712000,,315,3.787878787878788

7090844,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Love this one!  Over the past 12 years, I have bought and enjoyed many of Leslie's workouts and only recently bought two new ones.  The 20 minute fast walk in this DVD is fabulous.  It really gets you heated up and I like the 20 minute limit.  You can do it once, go do something else and come back for a repeat.  The weight lifting session is good but I'm not really interested in getting down on the floor since I've had two hip replacements, so I did what I could of that one standing up and in the slower parts, performed her usual walk movements.  Haven't tried the leg part yet but just wanted to praise that 20 minute fast walk now.",1475020800,,639,4.154471544715447

7090846,4,B00VJIIOSC,I wish there was more toning but it is good.,1474502400,,44,3.5
7090847,4,B00VJIIOSC,I wanted to bump up my work outs...so I bought this DVD...after doing it a few times...I bumped up the weights and started doing the exercises while Leslie was chatting...that way I get more reps in.  I like her workouts...I just wish she would cut some of the chatter.  I use 8 pounds for the upper body segment...10 pounds for the lower body segment.  To me the cardio segment is a waste of time...it doesn't get my heart rate up enough...that being said I've been working out for a long time. I wish this DVD was longer...but...you can repeat it.,1474156800,7,549,4.47
7090848,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Leslie is a good trainer, but so very chatty. She explains so much I get impatient waiting to start the move. I would also like to hear the music sometimes rather than her exaggerated laugh and repetitious chatter. Despite these objections, I keep buying her videos because the exercises are effective.",1473897600,,302,4.9411764705882355
7090849,4,B00VJIIOSC,This is good for an older person that can't handle the tougher workouts. It's fun to do. The instructor is amusing.,1473811200,,115,4.523809523809524
7090850,2,B00VJIIOSC,"This is my final purchase of Leslie Sansone's DVDs.  I've bought several in the past, but the later DVDs appear thrown together, and not as polished.  I will not be using this one for sure.",1473811200,2,189,4.371428571428571

7090852,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I sustained a very severe injury to my left leg in May 2016. Do to the nature (and 4 surgeries), my fitness level has decreased dramatically and, despite all I could do, my weight increased. I was an Insanity and P90X person prior to this injury. My point? In order to get back into shape, I needed something realistic and effective. This DVD is it! While a HUGE difference in intensity level, it has allowed me to start rebuilding my leg muscles with minimal impact and allows for an increased heart rate (you do have to push yourself to get that up). This DVD has helped motivate me to set short and long term goals, first using the walking and basic toning and then advancing to other exercise programs. Highly recommend it for beginners and those like me (recovering and re-building).",1472947200,4,788,4.595744680851064

7090855,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Can't argue with her energetic spirit, but the intermittent cackling was distracting and gets worse at the end. Call me a cranky butt, but I really don't care who her team of backup people are and the lengthy introductions at the end had me wanting to just turn it off
Crankiness aside its a decent little workout or warm up for advanced exercises.
I probably would not be inclined to purchase another of her workouts.",1472256000,,418,4.586666666666667

There are a total of three 20 min workouts.

*Upper Body Circuit

* Lower Body Circuit

* Fast Walk

I did all 3!

The video went by so fast as all of Leslie Sansone's 'Just Walk' videos do. But what I loved about this is that it combined strength training & walking. It wasn't just strength training, so you get your strength training in along w/some power walking. W/both strength training circuits you walk after so many sets, then more strength training. I get bored easily if a work out does not have enough variety, this is absolutely perfect for me. :-) I have many of Leslie's DVD's - I really like this one a lot!!!",1472083200,11,722,4.272058823529412

Her workouts do not make you feel any but great!! Again.... moving is better than not. Over the past year, with changing my eating habits, I have lost 40  lbs and no longer ore Diabetic!

7090868,5,B00VJIIOSC,I have many Leslie Sansone tapes and use them all.  Her tapes are challenging but not so complicated/difficult that you can't do them.  I was looking to add strength training to my work out and this tape did just that.  These tapes aren't for hard core athletes but they are perfect to keep you moving and in shape!,1469491200,,315,4.396551724137931

7090874,4,B00VJIIOSC,"I love the workout overall but the end of the fast walk gets lost as she's visiting the other walkers. That should be done after the workout. That's my only gripe. Otherwise, I love it!",1468454400,,185,4.314285714285714
7090875,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Sansone never disappoints. Easy to follow, quickly completed, done at your convenience with noticeable results. No need to suffer through getting fit. Just walk, with effective spot workouts.",1467676800,,191,5.857142857142857
7090876,3,B00VJIIOSC,"I have several Leslie Sansone exercise DVDs.  I like Leslie.  And I appreciate that she wanted to publish a routine that included toning exercises.  That being said, this DVD seemed like it was thrown together - almost as if they all met at her gym early one day to kick out another DVD.  Her DVDs give you the option of listening to her instructions/conversations with the music or just listening to the music alone.  I know she commonly says it doesn't matter what leg you are using, but it does if you are watching the DVD as you exercise and want to stay with the group's movements.  She has to double tap to get on the downbeat and be ready to side step in her desired direction several times.  In the upper body strength training segment she barely draws attention to correct form.  If you mirror her movements exactly then you should be fine, but often people overextend the body and can cause injury.  She accidentally uses the heavier weights during the floor movements and treats it more like an ""oops, oh well"" and keeps going with the heavier weights.  Beginners should be aware and compensate.  After seeing it for the first time you could just remember and use common sense to not use heavier weights for the tricepts extensions if you aren't yet ready to move up to the heavier weights.  I don't do the lower body strength training due to knee problems, so no comment on that.  However, the fast walk segment is definitely thrown together.  You can see that even the group has a hard time following her cues.  Near the end she visits each person in the group to thank them for coming.  This can be a nice distraction to watch while you keep your feet moving.  However, she takes too much time and then has to cut the cool down short with an ""oh well, you know what to do"" attitude.  I'm comparing the quality of this DVD with her other DVDs and it isn't nearly as good.  I still use it in my exercise rotation, but if you are on the line about whether or not to add this DVD to your collection, there are others out there (even beginning DVDs) that are better.",1467158400,16,2075,4.413157894736842

A CD such as Gilad's  Step and Tone works better for me.

7090930,3,B00VJIIOSC,I was surprised that one of the exercises was to be on a yoga mat on the floor.  Had I known that I would not have purchased this dvd as I cannot lie flat like that to do curls with weights.  I use the dvd for lower body strengthening and the fast walk which are circuits 2 and 3. A bit disappointing but you can't win them all.  Perhaps if eqiuipment is going to be necessarry on these dvd's it shpuld be clearly stated up front.,1459987200,,430,3.9767441860465116

7090932,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Love the 20-minute segments on this DVD and the modern modern set and music.  My only complaint, and seems to always be my gripe, Leslie Sansone talks too much!  I buy her DVDs because I enjoy the workouts and the concept but, wow.  The walk segment on this one is just about the worst I have heard.  Plus greeting all the people walking with her was an awful waste of time on this one.  I can overlook all these distractions after all the years I've done her program, but just as a warning to people who are just starting - all the cackling and yacking can be distracting and sometimes messes up her cues.",1459468800,4,606,4.280701754385965
7090933,5,B00VJIIOSC,"As per usual, Leslie is upbeat, down to earth and really gets my heart pumping and muscles moving. I really enjoy that this video is broken down into 20 minutes segments.

I usually do a upper & walk and a lower & walk. Make it more challenging by adding heavier weights.  This DVD has some of your old favorites with some new faces.  One of my favorites.",1458864000,4,333,4.140625

7090938,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have a handful of Leslie Sansone DVDs and enjoy doing them when I feel like some easier exercise, but I never felt her DVDs offered a complete workout.  While I realize that strength training is very important to health, I don't enjoy going to the gym so I need a strength routine I can easily do at home.  I love that this DVD combines cardio (via fast walking) with strength training because it provides a well rounded workout that will get you in better shape than cardio alone.  The music is upbeat and motivating, and I love the music only option, as Leslie's chatter can sometimes be a bit much for me.

I enjoy this workout so much that I've been doing segments of it every day, and it leaves me feeling energized instead of exhausted.  In a way, it's structured similarly to something like Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred in that it alternates between short bursts of cardio with strength moves, so it seems to go by quickly.  Unlike the 30 Day Shred however, I don't dread doing it and have to talk myself into it each time.  It also doesn't involve jumping which hurts my knees and annoys my neighbors. While you certainly aren't going to get ripped doing this DVD, I think if you combine one of the strength portions with the fast walking portion (maybe alternating between upper body and lower body every other day) you would get a full body workout and maintain a healthy level of fitness (and that's all I really care about).  I will admit that I sometimes substitute more challenging strength moves like push ups for some of the easier moves she does, like standing bicep curls.

The only complaint I have about this DVD is that she doesn't do any moves which specially target the core, so I usually add a few planks into the mix.  There's also no stretching segment, so it's important to add that in yourself.

Overall this is a fantastic DVD that I look forward to using every day.  I highly recommend it and think it could be a great way to introduce some easy strength training into your routine!",1458604800,6,2016,4.493150684931507
7090939,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I love this  strength  training on this workout. It is not too long and each workout is about 20 minutes or so. The workout  includes  upper body  toning with walking and lower body toning with  walking and an additional 20 minute walk. I was sore the next day. I alternate this workout with her other cardio workouts and I love it. I have read some reviews on here stating her training was improper and dangerous and did not possess the proper techniques..Really?
I  disagree with this thinking and  perhaps some people need to do their research more thoroughly. I did some readings on the "" chronic cardio theories ""etc. And they are just that. Someone's theories and ideas. I believe Leslie has been in the  in business long enough and has all of her proper certifications to know the difference  between what is safe training and what is not. Just my opinion... If you want to get tone this is the workout  and is the perfect pair  to go along with one of her cardio ones or a good stand alone. As I stated before there is a twenty minutes short walk on here in addition to her 2 toning workouts which is ok, but I prefer the toning on this workout moreso. I definitely can see and feel a difference  while using this twice a week in conjunction  with her other workouts! This is an A+in my book!",1458432000,7,1300,4.384937238493724

I have a few players and they all come up with the same message.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING  This  now makes me reluctant to buy any more through AMAZON.

7090946,5,B00VJIIOSC,"YES!  Leslie Sansone has such a great personality and she does not disappoint with these workouts.  I started off with her Walk Off Fat Fast, which is still my absolute favorite (I did the 40 minute every day for a month and lost 10 pounds and went down a dress size).  I was looking for something else from Leslie to add to the mix, so I wouldn't get bored and lose interest.  I purchased this DVD and some from Jessica Smith and I have found a really great combination of workouts that keep me energized, toned, and coming back for more.  Leslie's workouts never feel like a chore to me . . . I really look forward to walking with her!  I love that she incorporates weights in this one.

I would suggest this DVD if in fact you need both and really want a work out.  There are three different parts and can be done altogether or individually.  I did all three the first time and can do each segment during the week or if I am in a hurry can do one segment in 20 minutes and get results as well.

7090969,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I really enjoyed this workout. I've been using it with Leslie's walking app, and have already seen changes in the way my clothing fits. I haven't really changed my eating habits- just adding in some veggies and a bit less candy but no dieting as I don't believe in it. I rotate videos of hers throughout the week, and so far this one is my favorite. You do an arm circuit, a leg circuit and a fast walk. I've been using 5 pound weights but am feeling like I'm already ready to move up to 10! If you're a fan of Leslie, or are just looking for a less scary and more approachable way to add some strength work to your fitness routine this is a fantastic option. As an aside, I have suffered with sciatica off and on since the birth of my son 3 years ago, and I can say that anything Leslie puts out has never triggered it. In fact, since starting with her I've had far less flare ups! Just something I thought I'd mention... :-)",1456272000,,926,4.15

7091000,5,B00VJIIOSC,This video is an easy way to being using weights as time flies.,1453420800,,63,3.923076923076923
7091001,5,B00VJIIOSC,Ms Sansone's videos never disappoint. I began with just one 20 minute workout each day. I could tell a difference in my clothes fit within a week. The workouts are fun and easy to master. They are also easy to combine.,1453248000,,218,4.341463414634147
7091002,5,B00VJIIOSC,Very very excellent,1453248000,,19,5.666666666666667
7091003,5,B00VJIIOSC,I have many of Leslie's walks and this is definitely not a disappointment.  The 20 minute walk in this DVD is one of my favorites because of the variety of moves she does to keep you moving and keep your heart rate up.  The upper body section of the video is also very good and can be done at your desired level by using a weight that you are comfortable with.  The lower body section is primarily squats and lunges.,1453075200,,416,4.175
7091004,5,B00VJIIOSC,Good workout,1452902400,,12,5.5
7091005,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have multiple DVD's of Leslie's, and this one is by far my favorite. For two reasons. 1) it incorporates strength training which is a must for everyone. 2) the workouts are fun and full of energy. I love the more modern look they have in the backround in this video, as well as the music.  A lot of her older videos feel too dated IMO and it's hard for me to get pumped up, but not with this video. I love it, I'm wanting more like it!!",1452556800,,438,3.977272727272727
7091006,5,B00VJIIOSC,I have many Leslie workouts and really love the format of miles so I hesitated to buy this one since it is 3 20 minute workouts. But I am glad I did. It has a 20 minute upper body using weights with some walking and a 20 minute lower body using weights and some walking. I like both but I really love the fun 20 minute walk that is the 3rd workout. It is a great workout to do either the upper or lower followed by this 20 minute walk. It has some fun easy to follow upbeat moves. The music is more motivating in this dvd than some of her others. The time goes really fast and you have a 40 minute workout done when combining two of the segments.,1452556800,2,646,3.9389312977099236
7091007,5,B00VJIIOSC,I think this is a great video for beginners and intermediate exercisers. I've enjoyed every minute of it.,1452556800,,105,4.888888888888889
7091008,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have many Leslie Sansone DVDs, but this just might be my favorite....there are three different 20-minute workouts....one for upper body, one for lower body, and one that is just cardio.  They are all great.  The music is very fast-paced, so even if you only do one of the circuits, you get an excellent workout.  Highly recommend!",1452470400,,332,4.7894736842105265
7091009,5,B00VJIIOSC,Leslie's  this dvd is different than other dvds.i really like it.,1452470400,,65,4.909090909090909
7091010,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This one will KICK YOUR BUTT!! Do the whole thing, don't cheat and do one section and the walk segment...Do it all and you will feel it but it will feel good. I am an avid Leslie Sansone FAN...have been for years and years...even as far back as VHS...this DVD is more current and uses dumbells in the arms segment which is nice. The only thing is she doesn't que you to get ready to use them so you are playing a little bit of catch up when she starts. The beat is good, the different exercise are good: same ones KICKS, WALK UP 2/BACK 2, KICK BACKS, Power Walk -- she adds some variety in this one with double kick backs, etc. Spicing it up a little for us WALKERS!
The group had a couple new faces I hadn't see and a few I remember from past programs. She jabbers all the way through the workout (I don't know how she does it -- but it keeps us on track).
Good pace, good music, good exercise variety, up to date, easy to follow, can decide how to do the segments on your own.

Great product as usual -- pleased and pumped!",1452470400,2,1025,4.074257425742574
7091011,5,B00VJIIOSC,She doesn't have a bad workout but I like this one best,1452297600,,55,3.6666666666666665
7091012,5,B00VJIIOSC,I have a bunch of leslie dvds this is probably my favorite. It has strength training and a good walk. Time flies too!,1452211200,2,117,4.130434782608695
7091013,5,B00VJIIOSC,I love Leslie. I have several of her video and this is one of my favorites.,1452038400,,75,3.75
7091014,5,B00VJIIOSC,Perfect exercises for anyone that wants to start toning. I like it because in between strength training exercises you walk. You're getting two workouts in one video. Love Leslie Sansone's walking videos. They're easy and fun to do.,1451865600,,231,5.105263157894737
7091015,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Leslie does it AGAIN!! Love that is has 3 different segments so you can mix and match. Some reviews mentioned that the ""mile factor"" was not in this which is true, but not necessary. Especially with the 20 minute walk; as an owner of many Leslie videos, I can guarantee it is a mile. Leslie's upbeat personality is all here with walkers I have seen before and some I have not. She makes I FUN to work out!!",1451865600,4,406,4.217948717948718
7091016,3,B00VJIIOSC,"I love the break down of 20 minutes upper/lower/ cardio. But little upset there is no cool down.

Update. I hurt shoulder with this workout. I did for a month with three pound weights and moved up to 5lb. It felt too fast.",1451606400,,222,4.162790697674419
7091017,5,B00VJIIOSC,I always like Leslie Sansome Walk DVD;s.  Thank you!,1451520000,,52,4.777777777777778
7091018,5,B00VJIIOSC,FANTASTIC !!!! 20 minutes go so quickly. Already seeing  results after 3 weeks. . This  is  my first foray into  circuit training  and  I highly recommend it. Upper and  lower body workouts are great but I love  the  speed walking portion of  this  DVD  the most. Worked up a sweat. Own several of Leslie DVD's and this one will definitely  be in my workout  rotation.,1451347200,2,368,4.461538461538462
7091019,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have been a huge fan of Leslie's for years and this DVD is one of my favorites! I alternate my days using weights, walking and interval training with her dvds so my body isn't used to doing repetitive things. I can honestly say that this is a good DVD to tone your arms, legs, and butt (squats). I can't say enough good about this DVD other than give it a try. Though I wouldn't recommend it to those who perhaps have knee issues due to the squats but I'm sure you could improvise and do something else whilst Leslie is doing squats. It makes you sweat! Muscle burns fat even whilst you sleep",1451260800,,594,4.219298245614035

7091022,5,B00VJIIOSC,"great DVD however does not load properly. Have to stop and start multiple times to get it to load, by doing this I miss the option to chose which workout I want, it defaults to full workout.",1449360000,,190,4.162162162162162

7091025,5,B00VJIIOSC,I just love it!,1448496000,,15,3.0
7091026,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I am a Leslie fan for sure!  I often do not have time for a long workout, but these short 20 minute routines allow me to pop in the DVD first thing in the morning and get in a short workout before heading off for a long day at the office. You can also mix and match if you want a longer workout. I also love that I can do them in my own living room, since I am not the kind who wants to slog to the gym and put on a show.  I will admit, I am no longer a spring chicken, so the lower impact of these works well for me.  If you are looking for a high intensity, knock you on your butt type workout, these DVDs are not for you.  If you are looking for a moderate, brisk paced workout that gets you up and moving, keeps you in shape and lets you work up a light sweat, this may be your thing.",1448409600,11,788,3.6726190476190474
7091027,5,B00VJIIOSC,great work out!,1448409600,,15,4.333333333333333
7091028,5,B00VJIIOSC,I have several of the Leslie Sansone walk dvds. I like to change things up a bit and try a different workout so I don't get bored.  I love this one!,1448323200,,148,3.774193548387097
7091029,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I'm in pretty good shape for being 60, but the first time I did this workout, the next day, boy  I sure could feel it! I live in the rainy Pacific Northwest so it is really nice to have such an amazing variety of walk-workouts to do when you can't get outside.",1448236800,,260,4.0
7091030,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This one is my favorite of hers thus far.  I like the circuit training with the weights and if you heavy up you can really feel it even more.  Some days I do light weights but still get good workout.  I try to do all three circuits when I can because it flows well.  I hope she does one like this again with weights but make it continuous like 40 minutes plus for a longer workout.  All in all, very well paced, she was very focused and wasn't too chatty or distracted with the walkers until the end of the last circuit. I like her a lot and she seems very approachable and friendly and that goes a long way with me.  It's just I get annoyed when she gets too chatty during the workout and then I have to stop and reset or do my own thing until she gets back on track.  An enjoyable and challenging workout nonetheless.

I will say too on her website she has a new miracle miles system and that is the best system and worth every penny.  So to those who want more advanced options, consider that system when you visit her website again.  I don't see it offered here or elsewhere, but I think it is one of the best low-medium impact systems you will find anywhere.",1448064000,4,1163,4.128888888888889

7091034,5,B00VJIIOSC,Good introduction to incorporating weights to a workout routine. The twenty minute cardio is a great workout and one can easily interchange the three routine's to meet your needs. One of her best video's yet!!!,1447632000,,210,5.0285714285714285
7091035,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This is a great workout for beginners & intermediates, but probably not for advanced exercisers. I've gotten quite a workout in the past couple of days - I'm sore in all the right places!",1447459200,,187,4.529411764705882
7091036,4,B00VJIIOSC,I like Leslie's workouts. For those that complain about the miles -- you're probably burning the same amount of calories since in the workouts you are often moving your arms and legs in a greater range of motion and using more muscle groups than you would if you were simply walking. I wish she didn't spend so much time introducing the class.  We don't need to meet them every time we watch.,1447200000,4,392,4.444444444444445

7091038,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I love this workout!  I own several of Leslie's workouts, and this is probably my favorite.  They seem to be getting better with each release.  I love the strength training, and the music is fun.  I do however wish she included stretching at the end of the Fast Walk instead of walking around forever talking to everyone.  Stretching is extremely important to prevent injury.  She does state that if you need a stretch, you know the moves and can do them on your own after the workout.  However someone new to Leslie's workouts and working out in general might not know how to stretch properly.",1447200000,2,594,4.6

7091047,4,B00VJIIOSC,"Great video....Leslie does feel like a friend, not a ""i'm so hot and fit; make it your goal to be like me"" kinda fitness instructor. Nice thorough upper and lower strength training with 20 mins of power walking at the end. 4 instead of 5 stars because of her socializing and laughing throughout the last 10 mins (or so it seems) of the video. If she wanted to introduce her ""team"", she could have just named their names and had them wave at the camera and be done with it. It got tiresome. Wonder if anyone else thinks so?",1445644800,2,522,4.282828282828283

7091051,5,B00VJIIOSC,This is exactly the kind of workout I was looking for.  It alternates walking with strength training in an easy to do format.  The individual segment length is great for a quick work out or you can combine them if you have the time to do so.  It has really motivated me to work out.,1445558400,,282,4.090909090909091
7091052,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I love it!!  I've been walk/ running  outside for years.  When I moved up North I needed to find an alternative besides the gym.

7091062,4,B00VJIIOSC,"This might be my favorite LS workout. I am soooooooooooooo glad it's not just the usual 4-moves model. That just gets boring and lacks imagination. I like that in her more current workouts the group is younger and fitter, which helps to motivate. I'm glad it's not marked by miles. I have quite a few LS workouts and don't mind the traditional walks but I have enough of them and sometimes they're just retreads. I hope she makes more diverse workouts like this one.

7091068,5,B00VJIIOSC,I love that it has options. The upper body and lower body workouts. She starts with her usual exercises for warming up before getting into the upper body workout with weights. There is also a mat routine. It is a good workout if you only have 20 minutes. The lower body is also a 20 minute segment that you can combine with the upper body or do alone. I have a number of Leslie's dvd's. They give a great workout.,1443484800,,413,4.175

7091071,4,B00VJIIOSC,I like the strength training - both lower and upper body - and the fast walking but not really enjoying the music. It's a bit too techno sounding for me. Some of my favorite Leslie Sansone walks are the radio remixes and party songs. It's a lot more fun to walk to music that you know and love.,1443225600,,294,4.086206896551724

7091081,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Love this DVD!!!! As I get older & my endurance isn't as great as it used to be, the shorter workouts are much kinder to my body. One segment is just the right amount of activity for an after work, work-out & if I still have energy left I do another segment.  I have almost every DVD Leslie has made, and this is probably my favorite, at least at this point in my life.",1441756800,,369,3.9864864864864864
7091082,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I purchased this DVD with another one of Leslie's (Walk It Off in 30 Days) and some mornings I can't decide which DVD to exercise to.  I like this one because it has 3 20 minute programs.  You can tone/firm your upper body or lower body or just do a fast burn.  All you need is 20 minutes and some light weights. I would recommend a yoga mat and weight gloves to protect your hands.  I usually pair 2 workouts either upper or lower and then the 20 minutes fast burn.  It's quick, easy and fun.  My only negative is that at the end of the last 20 minute segment, she walks around to all of her walkers and talks to them which in the beginning threw me off a bit.  I got used to it and just kept walking.  I have recommended this DVD to my friends.",1441756800,4,746,3.9932432432432434

7091084,5,B00VJIIOSC,"Really like this workout. It gets your heart rate up where it should be and also targets problem areas for women. My leg muscles were sore the next day which made me feel like I got in a good workout. I also like the fact that if it's not intense enough for advanced walkers, Leslie states in the dvd that you could do the 20 minute segment again, which would give you more of an upper body or lower body workout. So glad I bought this. It's one of my favorites. Keep the new workouts coming Leslie Sansone!!",1441670400,,508,4.1938775510204085

7091093,2,B00VJIIOSC,"Love thus workout video BUT after awhile she gets so gaggy with her baby talk and talking down to her group like they are kids. Her laughter is annoying when she has to stop exercising to stay in rhythm. It just gets old after a few times playing the DVD. I just want to exercise and enough with the goofing around.

I was not pleased with the lower body exercises...only squats and anther exercise that are NOT GOOD exercises for bad knees.

Come on Leslie, stop this madness and work with older women....leave the youngings to another dvd.",1441152000,3,541,4.510204081632653

I have alot of her DVD's and I really enjoy this one because it has interval training, which is both strengh and cardio and is only 20 minutes long, so  I can do it in the morning before I go to work.

7091108,4,B00VJIIOSC,"This DVD is a little different from some of Leslie's others, no count down clock (which I don't mind) and a different group of people (well some of them)

There are 3 20 min. segments, upper body, lower body and fast walk.  The upper and lower body workouts are good old fashioned strength training, nothing too difficult but you can make it whatever you want by choosing different weights to use.  She doesn't count, which bothers me a little, so I'm not 100% sure she does the same amount of reps on each side but hey, what the heck.

The fast walk is typical Leslie, all the normal moves, she even has Nick lead during the short cool down.

There isn't really a very good warm up or cool down for any of these so you might want to do a few minutes of slow walking and stretching afterwards.  This will be a good addition to my rotation for those days I don't want to push it too hard.",1440115200,,887,4.218934911242603

7091113,5,B00VJIIOSC,I've had friends who have recommend Leslie's DVDs to me in the past so I thought I'd get one & see what it was all about.  I just loved it!  I like how she breaks it down to the 3 circuits and suggests that you do a different one very day or all 3 at once.  It was a great workout when I didn't want to go outside in the heat or this winter in the snow!  I highly recommend it.,1439769600,2,377,3.617283950617284

7091122,4,B00VJIIOSC,"I received this recently and have only done the Fast Walk segment.  I wanted to let people know that it is really good, except at the end.  It goes into the cool down, and she asks one of the walkers to lead the group.  I don't mind that, but it seems like when she does that, the camera person doesn't stay on the exercise leader.  This has happened in several of her DVD's, and I don't care for it.  Also, the stretching was not long enough.",1438905600,2,443,4.104651162790698

I had been working out at the gym for about 6 weeks walking on the treadmill and lifting weights. The day after doing this video for the first time, I was actually sore! Made me realize what I was doing at the gym wasn't really working me functionally. This would be way too easy for active exercisers.

The abs workout left some thing to be desired, because you are walking most of the time and don't do hardly any floor work.

I own about 6 or so other Leslie dvd's that are great too and give different workout levels, but I liked that this one because it broke out to 3 different ways to exercise. It dedicates a workout for the following: 1 to arms/upper body, 1 to lower body, and 1 to revved up walking. If you are in a time crunch you can squeeze in 1 - 20 minute segment of if you have more time you can do 2 or all 3. Leslie is great, motivating, and funny to watch.

7091204,2,B00VJIIOSC,"I have been walking with Leslie for over 15 years and that's what I like doing - walking, especially walking fast miles, and walking with weights and bands. I hate all the floor work and squats, etc.  The only segment I loved was the last one where she walked quite fast.  It is partially my own fault as I purchased this on a whim without reading about it first on line.  But, it is also the video's fault because it says "" JUST WALK"" in great big letters.  Maybe it should say ""TONE"" and 'SQUAT"".I also like it when she has a clock counting down the minutes, which also is not on this DVD.  My favorites are still her older ones where she does actual walking miles.  I know she is trying to appeal to the younger crowd with younger walkers, so I guess I'm left out.",1435363200,20,767,4.183673469387755

They're not high impact so if jarring aerobics isn't for you,  her videos are.
Also, if  you're just starting out, and are as out of shape as I've become,
these videos are easy to adjust your movements to slow your heart rate back down.
I recommend using Sansone's videos in combination with other aerobic videos,
free weights and resistence bands for at home cross training.",1434844800,10,455,4.675
7091213,2,B00VJIIOSC,Having been a fan of Leslie's workouts for years I was hugely disappointed with this DVD. She seems more interested in fooling about with the other walkers at the end of the fast walk than cooling down and as a result appears to run out of time to take the viewer through any kind of proper stretching. Luckily I have done her workouts many a time and can do one of her cool downs and stretch routines in my sleep - but what good is that to someone who hasn't picked up one of her DVDs before???,1434844800,24,495,4.11340206185567

7091217,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I finally received this DVD and I love it!  I had been hoping that Leslie would produce another one with weights and she has.  The pace is a bit faster than her older DVDs and the music is generic but upbeat.  She combines a few minutes of walking followed by a few minutes of target toning with weights and then walking again and so on.  I like this format very much. If you just want straight walking, then this is not for you, but then Leslie has a huge selection to choose from for that purpose. I would call this an ""all over body toning workout"" with some walking. I own all of Leslie's DVDs and this is one of her best, in my opinion.",1434672000,9,641,4.104
7091218,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This makes the 11th Leslie Sansone DVD for my collection.  I was interested in this one as it has strength training with the hand weights.  I love that the DVD is broke into 3 segments, Upper Body Circuit, Lower Body Circuit and the fast walk.  I have been doing all 3 together each time but it is nice to know if I just want to do parts of it I can.  I feel like a get a very good work out from this DVD.  I feel it is a nice balance between walking and strength training and she has a fun group of walkers, Nice to see Carrie again in this one along with Marvin and Nick.  The only negative I have on it is that that it is hard to follow the cool down at the end of the walk as Nick is leading it as Leslie walks around and introduces and talks to the walkers and you don't get the cues when Nick changes the moves.  I just keep an eye on what the other walkers are doing so after doing this one a few times I don't find that to be too big of a deal and definitely not enough to reduce my 5 star rating.",1434672000,4,1005,3.7799043062200957

Great Job Leslie!",1434499200,8,554,4.52
7091222,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This is a great workout.  I have been advised that for weight loss I need to concentrate more on weight training and a little less on aerobics.  This DVD fits the bill perfectly.  I alternate the upper body and lower body and always follow with the 20 minute walk.  (Be sure to alternate with other Leslie Sansone DVDs so you don't become bored).  Two weeks in you can feel the muscle development in my arms and legs.  I have also started losing weight, exactly as I was advised.  If you are participating in weight watchers, this activity is listed as ""circuit training"" and gives more activity points than aerobics alone.

7091232,2,B00VJIIOSC,"I was a big fan of Leslie's DVDs (and still am, mostly)... But then I learned about ""chronic cardio"" and how to ACTUALLY strength train.

First of all, doing ""lots of reps with light weights"" is 100% absolutely pointless. I really cannot believe that anyone in a professional fitness capacity is still touting this ancient myth. You build muscle by lifting heavier weights, period. If you can do more than about 8-12 reps, then it's too light and you need heavier weight. From everything I have read that was published in the last decade on strength training, this seems to be common knowledge. The gorgeously toned black woman in the video did not get that way by following any of Leslie's programs.

The speed at which she does the exercises practically guarantees bad form and seriously increases the risk of injury. I have been strength training for a few months now at home, so I don't get super sore when I do squats and lunges any more, even with moderate weight (10-15 lbs), but after trying to do this at the pace she suggests in the videos, I had serious issues with my leg muscles for days after. Not to mention, you should not be doing the upper body exercises at that speed with anything over 2lbs (which is pointless anyway, see above).

Also, there is no cool down or stretching after either of the ""strength"" sections... Totally my fault, but because I must have been on autopilot, I didn't do a single stretch after I did the lower body section (which may have also contributed to soreness). I can only imagine a beginner, not knowing you need to stretch, doing a section and being unable to move the next day.

Another point I want to bring up, and it may not be very popular but it's an honest observation: I have notice at least 3 of the women in Leslie's DVDs, through each subsequent DVD, seem to be getting heavier. This isn't exactly a good way to convince me that I should be doing all this cardio. In fact, the most notable weight gain was on Mary Kay in the older DVDs, and even at her heaviest, I could still barely keep up with her. So she was clearly in good ""aerobic"" shape, but she was gaining fat (specifically the more harmful belly fat) instead of losing it. Since she was an instructor at Leslie's studio I can only assume she followed Leslie's nutrition and exercise advice... That speaks volumes to me. For anyone interested, I recommend googling ""chronic cardio"" for the case against hours of max heart rate cardio per week. There is also some great strength training advice out there, two books I liked were ""The Paleo Coach"" and ""New Rules of Lifting for Women"". Both tell you why you should, at any age or fitness level, lift HEAVY weights at LOW reps (WITH GOOD FORM!!)

I love Leslie, discovering her led me down my path to fitness and health, but I think it's time for me to move on to better and healthier things. I still plan to use her videos (I own quite a few) but I just cannot stand by what I know to be bad form. I was willing to put up with her bad nutrition advice (every single person in this world should read ""Deep Nutrition"" and go from there), but I can't even count on her strength training methods.

I know not everyone will agree with this, but please, you owe it to yourself to do the research. Especially if you've been doing her DVDs and other ""cardio"" or ""strength training"" for a while now without results. There's a reason. They tell you you're doing the right thing and you think ""how could all this exercise possibly be BAD for me? Even if I'm not getting results, it still has to at least be GOOD for me..."" but clearly something isn't adding up (which is why I went in search of further truth, having already been familiar with Weston A. Price).",1434067200,58,3718,4.4602941176470585
7091233,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I really like this video.  I have other Leslie video's so I thought I'd try this one to get started with dumbbells--I know weight exercises are important but I just have not found a video I liked plus I have tried many other videos that use dumbbells and they always do the reps so fast that it's hard to keep good form.  And I don't want to just do dumbbell exercises on my own because it's boring!  I like this video because the exercisers do the weight work slow enough that it's easy to keep good form.  Also, I like that it's not only weight work but also walking mixed in.  I also like the cast--they look and act like regular people and not like they are auditioning for a tv show.  And you can pick which segment you want to do or do all of them in one session--this is a really nice feature on Leslie's dvd's.  And finally, I like Leslie because she is not intimidating and so friendly.  I'd recommend this video to anyone who is ready to start with dumbbells but who also wants some walking mixed in.",1433980800,2,1010,4.223958333333333

7091235,4,B00VJIIOSC,"This is good because it adequately combines strength training and cardio and you have the option of using heavier weights which is very helpful in giving your metabolism a 'bump'.  20 minute segments are pretty adequate and altogether translates into a 60 minute workout.  I find 2 segments at a time suits me so that I don't overload my joints too much, especially my knees.  That's 40 minutes and a pretty good workout at least for me.  Leslie has been saying for awhile now that strength training is essential in helping with endurance and weight loss, and she's right.  I definitely recommend this video to those who want to step up a little bit in their workouts.",1433808000,,668,4.6752136752136755

7091239,5,B00VJIIOSC,"This is an excellent workout with circuit training. I have many of Leslie Sansone's DVD's and Leslie is up with the times now!  I would use Leslie and then when I really got in shape, I was using Jillian Michael's circuit training dvds.  Well, this DVD is Jillian ""light"".  It is so good for you to do the cardio, get the heart rate up, and then do strength training, then cardio.  Burns calories and tones like crazy.  I did the upper and lower body this morning and my muscles can feel it!  Love that she is pulsing with lunges and squats.  It really works the muscle.  The 20 minute fast walk is fast and a good fat burner.  This is probably her best so far!",1433721600,21,661,4.224
7091240,5,B00VJIIOSC,Love it!  I love these new ones that include some weights work too.,1433635200,3,67,4.153846153846154
7091241,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have been a fan of Leslie Sansone's walk workouts for a long time, but I have never owned one that had such an emphasis on strength training and toning. I did all three segments of the workout for the first time today (they are 20 minutes each, for a total of one hour), and I think it's fabulous. The upper body and lower body segments alternate between toning and fast walking, and the final segment is fast walking only. The three segments may be combined in any way. Also by using heavier or lighter weights, it is easy to adjust the intensity of the toning segments. So this workout can be light or challenging, short or long, depending on your needs for the day.

As always, Leslie comes across as warm and encouraging without being annoying or seeming fake, and everyone in the room seems to be having a good time. She makes me feel like I'm doing something great for my body without punishing myself to the point of injury. I especially enjoyed her weight loss advice in one of the segments.

If I had one criticism, it would be that I wish the camera angles allowed me to follow along with the steps being performed at the end of the fast walk segment, when Leslie walks around the room and thanks each of the background exercisers for joining her. While it is really sweet, it is impossible to see the exercise part. I just had to tell myself that it didn't really matter since it was the cool-down anyway, and I just marched in place in time to the music. Directing an exercise video should be really, really simple--always make sure you can see at least one person's feet and/or arms (whichever is most relevant to keeping up at that particular moment), and make sure the person on camera is doing the moves correctly. Easy peasy, and it annoys me more than it should when that doesn't happen.",1433635200,140,1807,4.45619335347432
7091242,5,B00VJIIOSC,One of her best ones... 40 minutes of walking and weight work out... Segments for walking then segments of upper body weight training the walking and lower body weight training unlike her other ones that she works out a little of everything in the same work out..,1433548800,4,263,4.617021276595745

7091244,5,B00VJIIOSC,"I have a ton of Leslie's DVDS.  This time she has outdone herself. It is by far my favorite strength training workout, different from Walk It Off In 30 Days (Firm)  with circuit training.  I felt so good after doing it that I went out and bought 10lb dumbbells as I was using 8lbs",1433462400,7,280,4.148148148148148

8710304,2,B00VJIIOSC,"Ok, the exercise part is excellent. The DVDs are super flimsly, poor quality. Everybody I personally know which purchased any DVDs within the ""Walk Away the pounds"" series has had to replace their DVDs ... until they just give up. My self included, I bought three different WATP dvds. The dvds each started skipping after the first play. I bought them dvds again, this time with the replacement insurance. Same thing, the new dvds began randomly skipping too. Same thing happened to others & my friends. The workouts are really fun, such a shame the dvd quality is junk.",1532908800,,570,4.767676767676767
