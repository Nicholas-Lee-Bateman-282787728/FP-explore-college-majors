8149405,5,B000JBXHXC,"I own a 1983 Porsche 911 SC. We have been together 30 years. Be prepared to be very busy
when you drive one! Mine has 5 gears forward and of course reverse. There is heavy breaking
and clutching, and the Porsche gives a lot of speed with every shift. The engine is in the
rear, but you can hear the Porsche coming a block away, especially when you downshift.
But, the Porsche is pretty sound proof inside if you have the windows rolled up. My
Porsche is bright red with a ""whale tale"" on the rear. The Porsche is timeless, and it is hard
to believe mine is 30 years old and going strong. I enjoyed the dvd very much. I once had it in
5th gear going to Las Vegas. I was nearing 180 miles an hour. I immediately downshifted to 3rd gear.
Plan on first and second gear in town.  The Speedsters in the 1960's were great. Look up Janis
Joplin's Speedster on the internet.",1360540800,,865,4.179640718562874
8149406,5,B000JBXHXC,"Good brief overview of Porsche history from 1930's - 90's.  Better than other Porsche DVD's I've purchased.  Glosses over the important integrated development of the 986 and 996, key to modern Porsche's economic survival.

The real value of this DVD is the ""Extras"" section, including shop scenes of 917 construction and LeMans shop car prep.  Many racing clips from Nurburgring and leMans in early and mid '70's. Many famous faces.  Period Safari Rally coverage also excellent.  Run time for the bonus features is about as long as the main feature and is perhaps the best part of the package.",1275955200,5,593,4.9393939393939394
8149407,5,B000JBXHXC,I purchased this as a gift for a Porsche lover who has everything- and I will say this was amazing. We both enjoy watching it again and again!!,1255392000,2,143,4.142857142857143
8149408,4,B000JBXHXC,"I recently bought this video and enjoyed the history of the line.  There are a couple of minor errors in the video, but a good overview of Porsche.  I would have liked to seen more on the 911.  If you're looking for 911 history, go with the History Channel DVD that Amazon sells.  The bonus features are all quite good vintage footage of Porsche racing, including Le Mans and The African Safari Rally.",1230854400,7,401,4.4520547945205475
