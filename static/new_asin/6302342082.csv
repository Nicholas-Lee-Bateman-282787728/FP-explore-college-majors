454046,5,6302342082,"When opera moves me to tears, it truly is grand, and the ending of this version is soul-stirring and thoroughly captivating.
The highlight of this fabulous production for me is James Morris' Wotan. It's a riveting, emotional performance, with vocal passages of pure gold.
Act 3, Scene 3, the parting of Wotan and Brunhilde, magnificently played by Hildegard Behrens...""Farewell, my brave and splendid child""...so tender and passionate, so full of beauty, the music soars and takes my heart with it.
Another performance of power and presence is Jessye Norman's Sieglinde, Christa Ludwig is perfect as Fricka, and James Levine keeps it all together masterfully.
Just over 4 hours long, this tape set has a booklet with an excellent synopsis, and the sets (the final fire effect is great), lighting, costumes and direction are wonderful, but it's James Morris that makes it a triumph, and one to enjoy again and again.",1003017600,17,915,5.1066666666666665
454047,5,6302342082,"This is what DVD is all about!
The best seats in the house - not just front and centre, but in various other positions. And you are  taken on stage so close that you feel you can touch the singers. And what superb singers they are! The first part belongs to Gary Lakes as Siegmund, and Jesse Norman as Sieglinde, ably supported by Kurt Moll as Hunding. The second part is dominated by James Morris as Wotan, and the beauteous Hildegard Behrens as Brunhilde, with Christa Ludwig playing a smaller, but nonetheless dramatic part, as Fricka.
Wagner's operas are not for the faint of heart, or stamina - hence the expression ""with the build of a Wagnerian singer"". There are not many tuneful arias that you can sing afterward, as is the case with the operas by such other masters as Verdi and Puccini, but the music is stunning and powerful, and in this presentation, the performers do Wagner's score full justice. The drama is in the singing and in the story line.
This is just one of the four operas in The Ring Of The Nibelung series, and it takes all of four hours. A live performance would add another hour, with the various breaks. I did cheat a bit, in that I viewed it over two nights, in my comfortable recliner, with copious draughts of rum and coconut water (milk), but I was totally absorbed until the very end.
The staging was superb, with a haunting blue light pervading many scenes, but the spotlights were clear enough, to do justice to the singers' faces, and the rich costumes. This is in line with what you would expect of a Metropolitan Opera production, with a seemingly unlimited financial budget. The orchestra fully supported the singers, and the effect in surround sound, makes an investment in such equipment, worth every dollar.
The enclosed booklet was very informative, unlike other DVD productions, where one is forced to take out the booklet that accompanies most CD music versions (assuming one already owns such), to provide an occasional synopsis of the scenes.
A well staged, dramatic opera, magnificently sung - what else can one ask for?
I just can't wait for other releases in The Ring series.",999907200,18,2127,4.68716577540107
454048,4,6302342082,"After having watched this video twice I couldn't resist an opportunity to offer some comments and observations. People are going to either love the individual singers or hate them. I feel that Gary Lakes as Siegmund was neither a good visual or vocal match for Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, but he acted very well. Kurt Moll as Hunding was for the most part convincing, but he spent too much time in Act I glaring at Siegmund, complete with a raised eyebrow, not unlike a 19th Century version of The Rock.  Jessye Norman to most listeners would be the ideal Sieglinde, but on at least two occasions she held high notes (for presumably dramatic effect) longer than stipulated in the score. Her rendering in Act III of O hehrstes Wunder was breathtaking. Christa Ludwig as Fricka was excellent in Act II and it was gratifying to see this veteran mezzo in a live performance, and she deserved her very loud ovation. James Morris as Wotan was vocally good and dramatically perhaps better. Behrens' Brunnhilde lacked power but her voice was accurate. She was a good visual match for Morris. In the Farewell Scene during ""Der Augend leuschtendes Paar (sp?)"" when he is looking into her eyes, there was an overhead camera shot from the top of the stage which caught a distinctive glistening effect. It was quite touching. The overall stage production by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen was convincing in a traditional manner, and the fire effects at the end were impressive.
As for the conducting, although it was a bit of a slow reading at 4 hours and 4 minutes, I did not feel the tempo dragging in the same way that Reginald Goodall's live performance did. The end of Act I had plenty of adrenalin. The Met Orchestra, 101 musicians I believe, played very well and the VHS digital tape had surprisingly crisp and vivid detail. I think the singers were a bit swamped at times by the open orchestra pit, as opposed to the Bayreuth acoustics. For those who like Wagner played to the hilt in the big moments, this performance should be a very satisfying experience.
For those who may never have an opportunity to experience a live performance at the Met, this should make a very worthwhile investment.",996537600,13,2185,4.75
454049,5,6302342082,"<Die Walkure> has always been my least favorite of the Ring operas, but the recent DVD release of this work on the Deutsche Grammophon label (073 011-9) has done much to change my mind. Recorded at the Metropolitan Opera in 1990, this production (long available on VHS) has James Levine conducting a high-powered cast (and nothing less than that will do for any Wagner opera) and using generally slower tempos than (say) Solti would use. ""Walkure"" does tend to move like a glacier throughout most of its nearly four hours, and Levine's leisurely approach does not help.
  On the other hand, his Sieglinde (Jessye Norman) is in great vocal shape, as is her Siegmund (Gary Lakes), and Wotan (James Morris). Kurt Moll's Hunding is well acted and he still has that basso of old to give the character dignity and menace. If you can accept Lakes and Norman as twins (what would John Simon have to say here?), you still have to overlook their somewhat wooden acting. (and tell me if you agree that Norman's costume seems to come from another opera!) But Hildegard Behrens' Brunhilde makes us believe she is a vibrant teenager, although she has to strain to keep her voice from petering out during this difficult role. Christa Ludwig's brief appearance as Fricka tells us she is a bit past her glory days vocally, but still she creates a believable character.
  It is interesting to note that Norman sits out Act III to take a final curtain call, but Lake and Moll do not. Otherwise engaged?
  It is good to see an old-fashioned, non-concept, production of this work without Teutonic heroes in tuxedos or scenes acted in hypercubes. One does not really expect horses any more at the start of Act III, a sequence nevertheless done with excitement in this production. This version seems designed to tell the story without forcing 20th century interpretations on Wagner's Romanticism.
The two DVDs run at 241 minutes in the 4:3 screen ratio and have subtitles in English, French, Chinese, and (finally!) the original German, an idea that should be used for all operas on DVD.",994118400,16,2064,4.8
454050,4,6302342082,"I owned the laserdisc version of this version of ""Die Walkuere"" and I am happy that it has finally appeared on DVD. Hopefully the other operas of the Ring will be available soon.
There are three singers that deserve all the praise for this recording: James Morris makes a simply incredible performance. Not only does he have the size and appearance one would expect for Wotan, his understanding of the psychology of the role is impressive. His monologue in the second act is simply superb. He expresses Wotan's grief in a way probably only Hans Hotter could parallel. His German is also one of the finest, with all the nuances and enunciation where they should be.
Kurt Moll shows once again that he is one of the greatest basses of this century. His Hunding is as perfect as it is in Solti's recording.
Yet my favorite character in this production is Jessey Norman's Sieglinde. Not only is her German perfect, she shows an almost neverending source of beatiful Wagnerian sounds. ""Du bist der Lenz nachdem ich verlangte..."" is probably one of the finest pieces she has ever recorded, and it is certainly the best on video.
Not so convincing to me are both Gary Lakes and Hildegard Behrens. The first one evidences a stressed voice and a strange sounding accent. Behrens is a fine singer and her physical appearance is well suited to play a Walkuere, but I still don't find her totally convincing - however, this is probably her best recording on Levine's version of the Ring.
This is certainly a ""must have"" for any real Wagnerian fan and also for Jessey Norman's unconditionals (among which I should be included). If you want to try a Wagner opera for the first time, probably you ought to go with Domingo/Solti's Lohengrin.",993513600,11,1725,4.73421926910299
454051,5,6302342082,"This Walkure is well done and some critis may differ. It is pleasing from a visual stance as the sets do the work justice. I am particularly fond of the first and last acts. Act two on ocassion,without any prejudice to the vocalist's. The singing in total is first rate throughout. What a team in Act 1 Norman Lakes & Mohl. Act II Wotan(Morris)giving into Fricka's demands. The ride of the Valkuries is uplifting and well done. Brunhilde sheilds Seiglinda incurring the wrath of Wotan for carring out his secret wish and is punished with eternal sleep until a hero worthy wakes her. Overall the production is superb in both aural and in the visual sense. Like many other's DGG has done this  production does a great justice. Bravo Levine, Bravo to the Artist and to all the factors having a hand in this prodution.
very well done. Hopefully DGG will pull out all the stops and bring the complete Ring out on DVD as they did on VHS. This would be someting to look forward to. I did watch it live when PBS broad cast it in the late 80's.",992390400,7,1035,4.4188481675392675
454052,4,6302342082,"The highlights here are the performances of Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, Christa Ludwig and Fricka and James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, overall this is a fine performance.  Gary Lakes' Siegmund is  overwhelmed at times by the orchestra but overall he does a nice job--the  first act is the highlight of this performance and it receives a thundering  ovation at its conclusion.
The production by Otto Schenk is probably the  most traditional staging of the ""Ring"" cycle one is likely to see  nowadays--however since modern productions have included such things as  bungee-jumping Rhine Maidens and Valkyries riding motorcycles that may not  be such a bad thing.",949968000,11,677,5.261682242990654
7824546,5,6302342082,"I have become a fan of Wagner's ""music dramas"",  his name for his opera creations,  and have put his political views aside. This music drama has all the attributes of many of his other operas, especially the balance of his Ring Cycle: strong story line; willful  characters; good staging; fine voice;, and, occasionally,  outstanding music.",1420675200,,340,5.127272727272727
7824547,3,6302342082,"Fairly traditional production of Die Walkure, at least it's not some deconstructionist dreck. Brunhilde is played by a Negress, which is as distracting as it would be for Jim Carry or Clint Eastwood to play the part of Martin Luther King in a civil rights drama.",1414886400,,262,4.717391304347826
7824548,2,6302342082,"Gary Lakes (Siegmund) is about as interesting as a half-eaten bowl of soggy cornflakes. Jessye Norman (Sieglinde) does not function well as a ""rescue-me"" soprano. Sieglinde should be pure-sounding and girlish, like Gundula Janowitz, not husky and deep. Also, I agree with the other reviewer who said that Jessye Norman is too big, too imposing, for the role. She also overacts, and her German diction suffers from numerous defects. I'd rather see and hear her in the role of Erda--the pitch might be low for her but the voice-quality and personality are more appropriate.

Kurt Moll (Hunding) is totally unable to play stupid characters. He always sounds like what he is--a natural musical genius. This is also a problem when he sings Osmin and Baron Ochs. He comes off seeming way too smart. He's much better playing contemplative, spiritual characters like Gurnemanz in PARSIFAL or the Archangel Raphael in Haydn's CREATION. (I think he knows this about himself, which is why he never tried to play Hagen.)",1414886400,,1008,5.0359281437125745
7824549,4,6302342082,"Well, this is the kind of DVD that will inspire hot passions, either pro or con.  The legendary vocalists that used to take on these roles are no longer singing, and many of the singers on this disc are a clear step below them.  Even some of the brightest stars (Ludwig, for example) are past their prime.  Still, do those here make a convincing production?  In my opinion, yes. Behrens, for example, is good at using her instument to good effect, and certainly brings other positives to the role... coming off as an active young woman rather than a large, static matron.  Morris is commanding in the role of Wotan. The others are good, if not overwhelming.  What will probably be the most important factor for casual opera viewers (and particularly to newcomers) is that the staging is visually gripping and comprehensible.  Some more experienced viewers have savaged the production as being too simple, traditional or ""easy.""  This is not may opinion.  To me, many of the visual daring ""concept"" productions are perhaps interesting once, but become cliche immediately thereafter -- their ""newness"" is their only selling point, and once its no longer new, well.... The Met's Walkure provides a world where magic can take place, focuses on mythic elements, and lets the undercurrents of subtext remain undercurrents.  Is this the only approach?  No, and certainly some more ""modern"" productions help bring out important elements of the story.  But for those looking to jump into Wagner for the first time, the Met's production should make the plunge easier.",1035504000,11,1557,4.992248062015504
7824550,2,6302342082,"The best thing of this Metropolitan Opera production is that it is more or less true to the compoer's intention as regards the staging. There're little of those stupid directorial strokes which opera-goers come to expect these days. And that is a great plus.
Unfortunately, the performance leaves a lot to be desired. Levine draws great sounds from the Met orchestra. However, Levine's interpretation often lacks direction and at times his slow tempo tested the singers (especially the Brunnhilde).
Morris and Ludwig are superb as Wotan and Fricka. Lakes and Norman sound good enough as the pair of Walsung. However, their acting is not convincing. The great drawback of the set is no doubt Behrens' underpowered Brunnhilde. Her vocal production is pretty uneven (she sometimes makes ugly sounds even in the most easy of phrases) and she just can't cope with the slow tempo that Levine imposed on her, thereby resulting in choppy phrasing. Her acting is also less than satisfactory.
One can therefore see that, one the whole, it's not a very satisfactory performance. Quite a pity as there're not at present many choices for DVD versions of this opera.",1035504000,9,1152,5.036649214659686
7824551,2,6302342082,"Once again, James Levine proves he has no business conducting this opera. The opera opens with a storm but with Levine it's a stationary front. His tempo after Siegmund's ""Ein Schwert"" are far too slow. Unlike Goodall's slow reading, Levine lacks any pulse or theatrical feeling.
James Morris' habit of singing out of the side of his mouth and swooping into notes (which has since become more pronounced) hurts the musical flow and the impact of the words. Brain Large's insistance on close ups also robs the presentation of the power it could have (which is typical of Large's stupid video direction).
Behrens is a fine Brunnhilde. Norman may be too powerful for some tastes as Sieglinde but I like her even tho she needs a much stronger Siegmund than Gary Lakes (where was Jon Vickers?).
The best part of the production is the staging that avoids the idiotic ""message"" staging of small-minded current stagings in which the directors think they know the work better than Wagner who, like Verdi, left explicit stage instructions.
While this performance is hardly moving or even a good example of the riches of this opera, it is better than any other video.",1020729600,10,1156,4.843434343434343
7824552,3,6302342082,"When Richard Wagner conceived his form of opera/drama he had in mind the ""total art work"" or gusumptkuntswerk, music art in all of its elements including visual. One of the greatest problems I had as a youngster trying to develope an appreciation for opera with my visual esthtics conditioned by cinema was the sad fact that so many fine opera singers do NOT look their parts visually and try as traditionalists might this is today important. This performance of Wagner's second Ring drama has many bright points and a few weaknesses, as a performance it is certainly worthy, but visually I find it unforgivably crippled by both Jessie Norman and Gary Lakes. I'm sorry to say this, but they just don't look their parts and it hurts the entire performance. Jessie Norman creates one of the finest Sieglindes since Regina Crespin in audio, but visually it just doesn't work. Gary Lakes is the weakest Siegmund I've heard on records vocally and worse yet visually. Still James Morris does a fine Wotan and the rest is visually and vocally well worth listening to.",1006387200,8,1060,4.829670329670329
7824553,5,6302342082,"I find it very hard to find fault with this Video presentation of Die Walkure. Some have made some very harsh comments here about this performance. Overall though, this DVD has the kind of psychological intensity that Wagner's music requires. It must also be understood just how difficult, if downright impossible it is to stage many of the stage directions Wagner indicated. I think it is really up to our imaginations to fill in the gaps. I'm sure the audience would enjoy seeing real live horses on the stage when the Valkyries sing at the beginning of the third act, not to mention the little present said horses might leave on the stage!
In reality, there is no perfect way to stage the Ring operas. They all ask for incredibe demands in set deasign and the imagination of the audience.
With this performance, the main importance lies in the singing, acting and of course the ability of the conductor to pace everything well. Levine does a stunning job here. Wotan's monologue builds to a stunning climax in the middle of the second act with his own kind of curse against Alberich. Morris never misses the high notes either and has no audible wobble in his voice. His power as a singer is truly evident at the end of the third act during the magic fire music. His chest notes cut over the top of the orchestra with power and majesty. The other cast is all excellent as well. Gary Lakes is another powerful singer who also has power in the high notes with the right amount of pathos. Jessye Norman has excellent expression and beauty of tone in her voice. She also displays wonderful facial expression and conveys the sympathy for Siegmund necessary for the part of Sieglinde. Although Christa Ludwig is past her prime here, she uses her voice intelligently and has the haughtiness of Fricka. Kurt Moll is a dynamic Hunding and his death scene will take your breath away. As for the Valkyries, it seems they could have been miked a little bit better. The video quality is outstanding and watching this in the dark in surround is a real treat. The lighting effects used in the magic fire scene are glorious and Morris as Wotan and Behrens as Brunnhilde are an excellent match on stage. Behrens may not have the power of past singers like Nillson or Flagstad, but she is convincing and has the technical prowess to sing the woops at the beginning of the second act.
This is a DVD I strongly urge any Wagner fan to acquire. Newcomers may want to shy away, since the program is 4 hours long. The picture doesn't seem to have any noticeable aging and the picture is sharp, clean and clear. An excellent transfer of the video element was made to this DVD. Blacks are very black and contrast levels are excellent throughout. The Digital sound is stupendous in a LPCM stereo track at 48KHz. This is worth the price alone. There is no hiss or noise evident in the audio track and sounds clean in surround. Just about any Wagner fan who snaps this up will not be dissapointed. There are no extras on this DVD, except for a series of still shots of other DVD's from DG. The subtitles are available in English, German, French and Chinese. The booklet that is supplied has many nice photos from the production, black and white paintings, as well as a very indepth synopsis for those new to The Ring. A very good booklet. It has a keepcase style case which proved a little difficult for getting the DVD's out so use caution when removing the discs. Perhaps in the future DG will release the other 3 ring operas from this production in the future. Wonderful cast, wonderful singing and a very tasteful original style production make this DVD unbeatable.",1005177600,13,3642,4.596006144393241
7824554,4,6302342082,"It could, in my view, be better read by Levine.  My personal feelings following the score and looking at the drama, is that Levine rushes through the music with his interpretation.  Wagner's music tends to either excite or bore, so I can understand why Levine rushes the score.  Were I the conductor, I would have taken the score at a bit slower tempo, but that is just myself.  Other than his rushing, I believe that Levine does a beautiful reading of the music and provides a wonderfully dramatic interpretation.
Hunding is marvelously cast, as is Siegmund.  Sieglinde, took a little getting used to but I feel is a good fit for Ms Norman.  Hildegard Behrens gives us a sexy Brynhilde and a superb performance which I feel is the highlight of this performance.  Perhaps the weakest link is Wotan--and this is only in light of the fact that his voice was overpowered by the orchestra on several occasions.",1004486400,,906,4.69620253164557
7824555,5,6302342082,"Now I can see why tickets to performances at The Met are so expensive.
I have seen so many Wagner productions on TV and video, all with modern ""deconstructionist"" settings, that this DVD is a joy to watch, with a Wagner opera presented as The Master intended - horns, spears and shields aplenty, and rocky mountain crags echoing with the dolcite tones of Valkyries shrieking.
Wonderful stuff! And music that would turn the most evil mountain troll into a pussy cat. Wagner's leitmotives swirl around your brain for days after watching it!",1003881600,3,538,4.858695652173913
