8342774,5,B001U3YNUO,"In the late 70s and early 80s, I got caught up in the New Wave music revolution and Devo was my favorite band. I discovered them through an article in the Wall Street Journal, of all places. In any case, I bought all of their records and found their music delightful. It was high energy and had a certain tongue-in-cheek humor about it. In short, it was fun. I went to one of their concerts in 1979 at the Open Air Theater of San Diego State University.

Just recently, I discovered two Devo DVDs. One was the live 1980 Concert Tour video and the other was the ""Devo Live: In The Land of the Rising Sun"" video.  The Japanese concert took place in Tokyo in 2003. I watched and immensely enjoyed them both. The 1980 concert was just about as I remembered them from my own concert experience and the Tokyo concert (this DVD) was 24 years later. Devo had matured quite considerably and now were well into middle life. A couple of them had been eating well, I might add. It was the same Devo band except for a new drummer who did exceptionally well. It almost seemed a bit silly seeing late forties men dancing around, wearing yellow costumes, energy domes and going through the action of a rock concert, but nobody cared. Both the band and the young Japanese audience were having loads of fun. The band sounded great and gave a rousing performance. I set the disc in stereo mode and the sound was excellent. Most of the song selections were from their earlier records. I particularly enjoyed ""Whip It,"" ""Mongoloid,"" ""Blockhead,"" ""Gates of Steel"" and ""Freedom of Choice,"" although all selections were very well done. Evidently, the concert hall was up at about 100 degrees F and both the band and the audience showed it, but no one was complaining. The DVD concert footage was excellent, but the total program was somewhat marred by awkward and sappy interviews which added little. All in all, however, it was an excellent live concert recording and I'll watch this one again and again.

The Japanese audience reaction was very interesting. Here was a well over-the-hill American rock 'n' roll band of modest  homeland success and the young Japanese audience loved it. I'd guess that most of them couldn't even tell what the music was all about. But it was fun music, and they responded accordingly and begged for more. The whole video was a very entertaining watching experience, especially for an aging Devo fan who loved their music.
