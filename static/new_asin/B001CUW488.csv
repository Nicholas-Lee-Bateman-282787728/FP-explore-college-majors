8290061,5,B001CUW488,"This film is a very complex drama and in some sense reminds me ""Deliverance"", the terrible movie from John Boorman.
The story isn't told in a sequential way, but a broken one, containing some flashbacks. The philosophy behind this movie is I think, to explain one of ""these unexplainable crimes committed by normal ? people"" so frequent in modern society.
Summing up: in  interior Spain, there's an abandoned village when only live four- five people including a post of the Guardia Civil a specie of rural police,  the other inhabitants having emigrate to big capitals.
That's a beautiful lonely place in the countryside and has a cave for speleology and possible exploitation as rural tourism, so, Esteban, his bride Gabi and Pedro a friend photographer, three young people from Madrid, go there to see that place and his touristic possibilities.
So, Esteban and Pedro go to explore the cave while Gabi rest alone near his 4x4 car. But then, she suffers  an attempt of rape by a  salesman who sees her from his car while driving by the road. There's a furious fight and Gabi wounds the salesman in a hand with a knife. His attacker escapes and Gabi rests with a strong nervous shock climbing to his 4x4, and crashing against a tree.
Esteban and Pedro  return from the cave and finds Gabi almost unable to speak and explain what happened. The attacking man was dressed with a common white shirt.
But one of the few inhabitants of that village is Amadeo, a man also dressed that day with a white shirt. He's more or less similar to the criminal. He returns walking to his home after doing some shopping, so, Amadeo is wrongly identified as the criminal by the three furious young people, and without crossing a word, they attack him. Amadeo defends himself with a pitchfork and a shotgun. Esteban and Pedro  results wounded, but they kill Amadeo after a terrible fight. Only then, Gabi recognizes Amadeo isn't his attacker and  they warns the Guardia Civil.
These Guardias  are only two policemen, Cecilio, a veteran sergeant and Tomas, a common young guard. Furthermore, Tomas is married with Cecilio's daughter, he's tired to living in so lonely place and worried from his wife. He's who goes to see the killing. But in showing the desperation of the tree young people, Tomas says not ever the real criminals are found as in the cinema, and that jail is plenty of terrible people. This said, he makes a proposition: as Amadeo lived absolutely alone, he will accept a bribe of 90000 euro to lie, testify fraudulently and say the victim has disappeared by unknown reasons, as he was a free adult. Esteban disagree, but Pedro is terrorized and  Gabi convinces Esteban in saying she's unable to suffer the jail and destroy his life as a couple. They clean the blood and flaws of the house of Amadeo, throws the corpse into the cave and go to join the money. Tomas lies to Cecilio, a right man, who at first believes the version of his subordinate and son-in law.
 But there lives also Amos, an errant, strange foolish man, neighbour of Amadeo. He  says effectively Amadeo is killed, as he truly has saw the corpse in an interval,  but his dubious mind, as he says he hears voices from the cemetery, induces to not believe him to Cecilio, which however, being an experienced professional, begins to suspect of the behaviour of Tomas. In effect, his daughter is pregnant, but she says  Tomas doesn't loves her nor his future son.
Finally, Cecilio has to clear all the obscure facts, excepting the identity of the rapist who has get to escape. Cecilio, in a tense night scene, says Tomas he wasn't to  denounce him, but burns in a bonfire the 90000 euro of the bribe, lets escape to the three young people, and presents his resignation as policeman  while says Tomas  if he has lied that's only for his daughter, and lets very clear to Tomas he never, never wants to hear or spoke anything in his resting life from that dark incident.
An excellent film very credible about the psychological and moral barriers all we have in an extreme situation ever possible.",1241913600,3,4054,4.688732394366197
8290062,3,B001CUW488,"""The Night of the Sunflowers"" takes the lives of several people, seemingly disconnected with the discovery of a murdered girl, and weaves the various plot threads into a cause and effect-driven fable.

This portmanteau-style of filmmaking can, on occasion, go horribly wrong, but here, writer/director Jorge Snchez-Cabezudo has got at least the blend and rythm of the individual short films correct: none of the stories goes on so long as to lose our interest and there's just enough resolution of the overall story of the film to satisfy us when the credits roll, but enough ambiguity to keep us thinking long afterward.

Almost all of the principal actors are excellent, with Judith Diakhate (Gabi) and Vicente Romero (Tomas) giving particularly strong performances. The story's an interesting one, and, much like ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" before it, the layers of the story contain a multitude of their own subtexts and parallells and most certainly bear repeated viewing to fully uncover the whole of Snchez-Cabezudo's message. The photography is powerful, and the stark yellows and browns of the Spanish countryside compliment the main themes and forward the emotional impact of the film - for instance, when Gabi is attacked the surrounding scenery and isolated nature of the mountain woods makes for a more visceral and feral piece of film, and the nature of the relationship between Cecelio and Amos is amplified by the haunting silence of the abandoned village in which they live.

So why only three stars? Well, for me, the soundtrack was an afterthought, and before long, the music begins to intrude on our enjoyment of the story. But more importantly, there's just not enough drive behind ""The Night of the Sunflowers"" to keep the tension and pace of the film going. It's a slow-moving film, which in itself is fine, but the disparity between the tension - Gabi's story, the disappearance of Cecilio and the tension in Tomas' storyline - and the slower, more meandering content - is too great to make ""The Night of the Sunflowers"" work as a completely satisfying movie. Which is a great shame, since on almost all other fronts it's a real gem. This is a classic case of a two-hour movie that's a definite thirty minutes too long - or perhaps thirty minutes too empty - and while it's certainly worthwhile to go and see (when it's good, it's excellent), I can't recommend the DVD for purchase - once is enough.",1184112000,4,2427,4.929095354523227
