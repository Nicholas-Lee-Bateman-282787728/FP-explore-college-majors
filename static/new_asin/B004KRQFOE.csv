8433378,1,B004KRQFOE,"Disappointed. Misleading cover and title. It should be titled  ""The Human toll on Earth""
it is clearly an environmentalist documentary. Not Amazing Lands From ""Above"". this is basically ""bait and switch"" to push an agenda. I bought a few of these, ill be returning the unopened ones.",1464739200,,283,5.0212765957446805
8433379,1,B004KRQFOE,"Don't waste your money on these disks from Yann Artus Bertrand. Very little content is Above Earth. Poor direction,very preachy and very boring! Avoid like the plague.",1363996800,3,167,5.222222222222222
8433380,1,B004KRQFOE,"There are 7 billion of us, each consuming and destroying, all the while imagining that our tiny contributions have no consequence.  It's amazing what we can do (or damage) when we ALL work together, right?  I don't need to PAY anyone to tell me that.  By the cover art and info, I expected THIS disc to be lovely images of the ""Earth From Above"", accompanied perhaps by relaxing music or topical narration.  Instead, we get english narration over french interviews and dialog.  I get it: Don't eat the monkeys.

Less than half way through, I tossed it into the recycling bin.  I wish I had that time back; and the money.",1358640000,9,620,4.531531531531532
8433381,1,B004KRQFOE,"If you expected high-quality aerial videos or nature videography in style of BBC ""Earth"", as the jackets implies, you will be sorely disappointed. There's very little of the actual footage of the nature or land, and a lot of talking.  And most of that talking is crude environmentalist propaganda, devoid of facts and insights and full of platitudes.

Waste of time and money.  Deceptive advertisement on the DVD jacket.  Will never buy anything from this publisher again.",1334880000,10,472,5.090909090909091
8433382,5,B004KRQFOE,"In my experience, just about anything Arthus-Bertrand does is interesting, new, challenging and (usually) gorgeous to look at.  I thought this chapter of his Earth From Above video series met all of that criteria, and, moreover, delivered it in the high quality you come to expect from a Arthus-Bertrand production.  There are some long shots, some awesome shots of people in the field, and then conversations with thinkers about the meaning of nature, conservation, and the natural world.  You can watch this series and just appreciate the beautiful landscapes and animals without thinking too hard, or you can challenge yourself to engage the philosophy and ideas behind what Arthus-Bertrand is trying to do with this.",1304899200,6,720,5.243478260869566
8433383,2,B004KRQFOE,"This a french film about global impact of our culture on nature. It is NOT a large amount of new HD footage of the landscape from above but rather a sucession of interviews with people who are involved in saving the planet with a few aerial shots between. I was dissapointed when the person that was interviewed for the ecological impact of humanity on the planet was not a ecologist or even a scientist but a philosoper??? The blu-ray ""HOME"" is a far better production and contains far better footage of the same material minus all the interviews.",1303776000,18,548,4.6020408163265305
