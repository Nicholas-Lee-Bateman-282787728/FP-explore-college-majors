403317,5,6301978374,"Many film buffs agree that this film is the quintessential Garbo movie. The film was tailored especially for the star, and Garbo felt a certain spiritial affinity in playing a monarch of her homeland who lived from 1626-1689. To vintage-film TV watchers, this film is strangely obscure, yet this just might be Garbo's greatest performance (at least a close tie to CAMILLE) in her finest Hollywood film. Like the actress herself, her Christina inspires awe as much as adoration - it is a stunning performance, with her the closing shot being one of the most famed in the history of motion pictures. Salka Viertel, a friend of Garbo, tailored the part for her friend - (Garbo had spent 18 months vacationing in Sweden prior to filming this) - and her Christina is a fascinating, ambiguous, charismatic incarnation. The lustre of this production wasn't dimmed in the least by the equally romanticised albeit easily forgotton THE ABDICATION which starred Liv Ullmann in 1974. The movie owes a great deal of its taste and visual flair to its director, Rouben Mamoulian and the film isn't nearly as dated as one would suppose. The beautifully lit photography by William Daniels is excellent, the sets are eloquent and well-chosen supporting cast is first-rate. Twenty-six year-old Laurence Olivier was originally chosen to play Don Antonio, but he was replaced by John Gilbert, Garbo's former vis-a-vis, both on screen and off. This is his best-preserved sound performance; he would be dead at 38 three years later. QUEEN CHRISTINA met with widespread critical enthusiasm - as did Garbo's fine characterization of her countrywoman - but the film did not tickle the fancy of the hoi polloi during the depths of the depression, and it did badly and the box office, nor it win the awards it merited.",998438400,8,1790,4.97
403318,5,6301978374,"before i bought this movie i was told that it is nothing but garbo, garbo, garbo, i was not disappointed!
its opening holds back the swedish sphinx for siveral minutes, opening with a beautiful close up of that irresistable furrowed brow. from there is is a tour-de-force for her, her two famous scenes, the touching scene and her final close-up which holds a special place in the hollywood archives.
also i was forewarned about john gilbert, his acting voice-totally miscast. i disagree. i liked him in the part, okay he over acts in places, but hey-he and garbo re create that charismatic chemistry that explodes in ""LOve"" and ""Flesh and the devil"", also it made me sad to think this was his last, sadly dying not long afterwards.
i was disappointed in two things which are muffed over by the garbo vehicle, the extras and the music.
somehow i don't think Swedish peasants had a stong clear american tinted voice, such as the opening ""I used to be king of Sweden"".
The music is brutish in the ""touching scene"". it gives the lovely sequence an almost comic aspect, best to mute your tv while it is on, garbo needs not say a thing to be heard.
What makes this exciting is that it is the only scene that i see her cry, when Gilbert dies in her arms, she buries her head, raised it with a tint of a tear in each, she leans over him as if to kiss him, instead covers passionately his face with a cover, and proceeds into the greatest final close-up i have ever seen, the scene switching from her walking towards the bow, the sailors shouting as they proceed to sail, her touching the bow, the wind blown sails, and slowly the camera finds those haunting eyes-magnificent!",986515200,22,1668,4.508250825082508
403319,5,6301978374,"Garbo is enchanting as Queen Christina in this moving film. The highlights are numerous, but notable among them is the scene where she undresses in the inn, to the surprise and delight of the Spanish envoy, Antonio. The  next sequence is a curtained bed at the break of dawn. Hmmm, wonder what  happened in between time? Another moving scene occurs as the queen  addresses her subjects. Her consternation, coupled with love and agony, is  both poignant and subtle as she speaks to her people ""who are said to  love [her], but do not wish [her] to be happy."" The final shot is  poetry in action, captured for the ages. The ship has set sail, and Garbo,  st the stern, the wind rustling around her- she, who feels freedom and yet  has tasted sorrow and despair, is framed like the Mona Lisa- subtle,  sublime, sensuous- somewhere between the extremes of human passion, she  becomes art- transfixed in a moment that shines above the commonplace and  reaches for the extrodinary. Here she is at her pinnacle. Here is the  moment- preserved and completed- never to be equaled or repeated. Buy it or  miss the experience.",932169600,4,1115,4.715025906735751

And best of all, though Garbo no longer lived with John Gilbert, she demanded that Louis B. Mayer hire Gilbert as her romantic co-star. The result is magic, for both stars. Gilbert is fabulous, his voice is at the very least comparable to Ronald Coleman. Garbo's performance shows such versatility - and such beauty - that any person who watches this film WILL fall in love with her. Having Gilbert with her is genius.",1398384000,,552,4.701030927835052

403391,3,6301978374,"Many have called this Garbo's best movie and her best performance.  That's not saying much.  Most of her movies were bad and she was bad in them.  Her acting technique was straight out of Victorian melodrama:  breast clutching, back of hand to forehead with head thrown back, etc....  She would weave around so much I thought she would fall over.  This one fairly screams, ""I'm an important MGM historical costume drama!""  The sets are so overloaded with junk it's sometimes hard to see the actors(who seem to be struggling to move in costumes that look like they weigh a ton).  It also has that odd cheapness that MGM would sneak into their bloated frou frou -- many exteriors are obviously painted backdrops of the snowy Swedish countryside and look like Christmas cards.  The famous ""I am remembering this room"" scene(she has just spent a passionate night with her love and walks around the room caressing objects in it) is laughable as is the scene where Christina stomps out into the early morning and washes her face with snow.  Whatever the ""snow"" was made of, it makes crunching/crackling sounds.  But there's no denying that Garbo was a mesmerizing creature.  Her beauty was extraordinary, her presence radiant.  It's worth the price  just to look at her.",1383868800,,1264,4.845794392523365
403402,5,6301978374,"I bought this as a gift for my son's birthday because Queen Christina as a child behaves like his daughter, also my granddaughter.

403403,5,6301978374,"That's what it offers... glamour! The 1930s, that era of the Great Depression, had glamour figured out. Black-and-white cinematography somehow out-glamours color, the sound-stage painted backdrops of Sweden in winter out-glamour the most brilliant computer simulations of today, the langourous flow of sustained scripted scenes out-glamours the quick cuts and fades of current movie-making, and above all Greta Garbo out-glamours anyone in film history. Garbo was ineffably, soulfully gorgeous. Her acting skills, learned in the silent era, were more stagey than the current fashion approves, but she had magical presence on the screen. John Gilbert, the 'fading' silent star whom she demanded as her leading man in this production, was even stagier and perhaps campier in the role of the Spanish Ambassador for whom the Queen abandoned her throne, but he also had glamour, a Prince Charming presence. All in all, ""Queen Christina"" is a glamourous fairy tale, an operatic opening-night pageant of languid beauty.

The film ""Queen Christina"" is roughly as faithful to Swedish history as the film ""Jaws"" to the novel ""Moby Dick"". Hey, they were both about fish! If you want a factual biography of KING Christina Vasa, the most famous woman in 17th C Europe as well as perhaps the most interesting, you'll learn more from five minutes' reading on wikipedia. If you want a plausible depiction of events and society during the Thirty Years War, stick to the writings of Grimmelshausen and stay clear of Hollywood. The passionate love story at the heart of this film is pure invention. Christina's abdication was not an elopement, and it was just the beginning of the most compelling portions of her life. Her years as a girl King under the management of Axel Oxenstierna are in fact rather obscure, and her roughly eight-year reign as her own monarch was anything but successful. In reality, she bankrupted the regency by transfering most of her royal funds into the hands of the greedy nobility, resulting in a concentration of wealth and land-ownership that primed Sweden for centuries of maldistribution, exploitation of the peasantry, and stagnation. Swedish history, until the rise of the labor movement, was a laboratory for the failure of 'pure' capitalism, as absolutely nothing ""trickled down"". The truly important half of Christina's famous life took place in her years of exile in Italy and France, where she became arguably the greatest Patron of music of the Baroque era, yet music isn't mentioned in the film. Likewise she became easily the most prominent ""convert"" from Lutheranism to Catholicism; her prominence as a convert, indeed, was so great that her glaring unorthodoxy of belief and of lifestyle was beyond any correction that Papacy might have desired to impose. She was, in short, an 'untouchable' freethinker, an icon of independence for the boldest figures of the next generation. One could, with just a flare of hyperbole, call Christina the first ""modern"" woman.

But back to Garbo! There was an obvious motive for casting the Swedish actress, at the height of her fame, in the role of the Swedish monarch, aside from which the two women may well have had much in common. Garbo's voice, with her Swedish accent quite well modulated, was still a throaty alto, a voice that might have commanded male councilors, a sensuous but plainly masculine voice. Christina WAS raised, in effect, as a man; she did dress as a man at times, sit and walk like a man, dispense with niceties and proprieties like a man. Both Christina and Garbo have been plausibly 'identified' as bi-sexual in orientation. Christina was patently a woman of superior intellect, and one gets the impression that Garbo, who had virtually no school education, was a deep thinker by Hollywood norms. Possibly this similarity of 'being' was what enabled Garbo to occupy the role of Christina so fully. For my mother's generation, Garbo was Christina, and many soulful young beauties aspired to be Garbo.",1284508800,5,3987,5.113496932515337
403404,4,6301978374,"There was a brief time and place when the silent films had faded and talkies had begun, yet the people who survived the transition brought to the screen a sensitivity and level of emotion that has not been equaled since. Such is the value of Garbo's performance in ""Queen Christina"". Christina was Garbo's 8th talkie. Prior to this Garbo had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent films were ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) which was directed by Clarence Brown, and ""Love"" (1927) in which she co-starred with John Gilbert. She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.

John Gilbert co-stars, but his name appears in small print under the title. Quite a difference from the first time he and Garbo worked together. Their last film together had been in 1928 (""A Woman of Affairs"") and in that time Garbo had become one of the top screen personalities and Gilbert's career had declined, partially due to his soured relationship with MGM head Louie Mayer. But Gilbert never managed to make the transition to talkies complete. Even in Queen Christina you'll find his performance and even his appearance to be more appropriate for the silent screen.

There are some talented actors in this film, though most of them are wasted. C. Aubrey Smith and Akim Tamariff play aides.  Smith was a marvelous actor known for his roles as an aristocrat, though he plays an aide to Garbo here. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple.

Tamiroff is best remembered for his role as the Uncle Joe in Orson  Welles ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and twice was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The General Died at Dawn""). He plays an aide to Gilbert. Does an adequate job, but his talents are wasted.

Lewis Stone plays Garbo's court adviser. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Patriot"" (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in ""The Big House"" (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), Commissioner Smith in ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932), and ""Doc"" in ""Three Godfathers"" (1936). He's probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).

Reginald Owen gives his usual good performance as Garbo's cousin and a military leader, but he's on screen far too little and barely says a word. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971).

Rouben Mamoulian directs. Mamoulian made only 20 films, most of them in the 30s. Queen Christina was his 6th film. Prior to this he'd had success with ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and Marlene Dietrich's ""Song of Songs"" (1933). Mamoulian was known for his agile camera work and this style is amply demonstrated throughout the film. Visually the film is a treat, although at times the narrative does lag.

Walter Wagner produced this lavish film, complete with many outdoor scenes. In Wagner's 34 year career he was responsible for more than 60 films, such as the Marx Brothers first talkie ""Cocoanuts"" (1929), Fritz Lang's ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), Ingrid Bergman's ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), Susan Hayward's ""I Want to Live"" (1958), and Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra"" (1963). Cleopatra was his last film and the only one for which he was nominated for an Oscar.

Williams Daniels is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948).

The film received good reviews and was a box office hit. For Garbo fans it is certainly a must see and I think it's her best performance, although her presence in virtually every scene does get overpowering. The final shot is a long close up of Garbo's face. It took nearly 50 years for any actor to match the power of this final scene (Klaus Maria Brandauer in ""Mephisto"").",1282780800,,4711,4.761029411764706
403405,5,6301978374,".....The picture got better when pressure was put upon the Queen to send her Latin lover home and to marry a Swede who would give her an heir to the throne.  Garbo turned in some fine acting as she agonized over her final decision to abdicate and to leave with her lover.

.....The movie is interesting to movie buffs because Garbo and Gilbert had been real life lovers.  They met on the set of Flesh and the Devil when Gilbert was a Silent Film star and Garbo an unknown newcomer.  They lived together for three years but Gilbert wanted marriage and children and Garbo just wanted them to live together.  Finally when she refused his final marriage proposal, Gilbert broke off the relationship and married another actress.

.....When sound movies became popular some actors like Gilbert had their careers destroyed while others like Garbo were instant hits and became mega stars.  Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM had originally signed Lawrence Olivier to play the part of Antonio in Queen Christiana but Garbo, in an attempt to help Gilbert's sagging career, told Mayer that she would make the movie with Gilbert and nobody else.  Mayer, who hated Gilbert and had vowed to destroy his career, gave in to Garbo's demands and cast them together for the last time.  Two years later Gilbert was dead at the age of 36.

.....Garbo led a twisted and tormented life and was most likely AC/DC but she probably loved Gilbert as much as she was capable of loving any man and he came the closest to getting her to the altar.",1279843200,,1514,4.615671641791045
403406,4,6301978374,"Set in the 1600s, Rouben Mamoulian's QUEEN CHRISTINA is considered by many to be Greta Garbo's best film. It is if one accepts this as a total work of fiction, perhaps.

The real Christina was mistaken for a boy at birth, and when this error was discovered was still raised as a son and called ""prince."" She had her father's homely looks and was proficient in such manly activities as horseback riding, fencing and shooting. Crowned ""king"" at age six, Christina's education was tailored for a male royal, with tutoring in religion, philosophy, Greek and Latin. Her teachers said she had a male temperament.

Christina's autobiography reveals she never wished to marry and that the usual concerns of women were foreign to her. Contemporaries believed her to be gay-- more likely Christina was transgendered. She courted beautiful women, wore a mixture of male and female attire, moved, spoke and behaved as a man, having many male comrades (not lovers).

After abdicating the throne at age 28 in favor of her cousin Charles, Christina traveled extensively for many years in France and Italy.

The movie version of this unusual royal gives only a couple of hints as to her gender identity and sexuality. The script instead chooses to center around a fictional love affair with a Spanish ambassador. It's well done but historically VERY unsatisfying. The real Christina was far more interesting than Garbo's. A great opportunity to tell her fascinating story was squandered in this pre-Code motion picture.

As for Greta Garbo, she was a fine actress with a hard, angular face that's especially noticeable in her portrayal of the manly Christina.

John Gilbert was often paired with Garbo in silent photoplays and he's with her here for the last time. Gilbert's acting career was not (as is claimed) destroyed by his voice --which was fine-- but from a severe case of alcoholism, plus quarrels with MGM directors and their bosses who then actively sabotaged him. He made one more movie after ""Christina"" and died in 1936 of an alcohol-induced heart attack. John Gilbert was 36 years old at time of death.

(7.9) Queen Christina (1933) - Greta Garbo/John Gilbert/Ian Keith/Lewis Stone/Elizabeth Young/C. Aubrey Smith/Reginald Owen (uncredited: Akim Tamiroff/Tiny Sandford/Edward Gargan/Hooper Atchley)",1246924800,,2375,5.134715025906735
403407,4,6301978374,"QUEEN CHRISTINA (1933) was the first movie which Greta Garbo made as part of a secret development deal with MGM studios.  Other stars like Clark Gable had campaigned without success to head their own production units inside the MGM gates.  When it became clear that Garbo wouldn't submit to the same rules and restrictions as other contract players, a deal was brokered so that she would continue--under a reduced workload--as one of MGM's most valuable box office attractions during the lean years of the Depression.

With a script tailored by good friend Salka Viertel and sensitive direction from Rouben Mamoulian (with whom she'd later have a torrid affair), QUEEN CHRISTINA is one of Garbo's most effective and personal films, the story of Sweden's legendary Queen Christina, a woman renowned for her affairs with both sexes.  The character's bisexual leanings--painted so blatantly in Garbo's scenes with Elizabeth Young (as Christina's lady-in-waiting)--leave precious little doubt as to their true relationship.

QUEEN CHRISTINA also marked the end of Garbo's screen partnership with John Gilbert.  Although the two had enjoyed a long-standing relationship off the screen (exploited to tremendous effect in such silent classics as ""Love"" and ""Flesh and the Devil""), it had ended by the time that Gilbert played Don Antonio to Garbo's Christina.  He sadly passed away three years after his performance.

Regarded by most as Garbo's greatest performance, QUEEN CHRISTINA deserves a place in every classic movie collection.",1243123200,,1528,5.417721518987341
403408,4,6301978374,"Garbo is Garbo here, and that's really all that needs to happen.  She is splendid and it's worth sitting through this otherwise rather silly film to see her.  Historically, it's not at all accurate but if you are more interestd in Hollywood glamour than reality, then this shouldn't bother you.

John Gilbert really does look awful, and it's very hard to imagine that anyone would fall instantly in love with him.  But then it's even more difficult to believe that Garbo as Christina, dressed in man's clothes could convince anyone that she was a man.  Maybe if they had removed her lipstick and eyeliner...but that's show business.

403409,3,6301978374,"Many of the films of the great Greta Garbo are a trial because so often she was the luminous centre in absurd stories with unworthy costars. ""Queen Christina"" is one of the handful of films which rise to her level.

The films tells of the abdication of Christina of Sweden when she fell in love with a Spanish nobleman. The film starts slowly and not very well establishing Christina's persona as a peace maker surrounded by a court of ambitious war mongers. When it shifts into romance and the usual problem of royalty in films, loyalty and responsibility to country versus personal needs, it improves immeasurably. Garbo is subjected to a barrage of close ups by the director Rouben Mamoulian but they are carefully placed and she survives magnificently, superbly conveying her changing emotions. The object of her love is John Gilbert, a giant silent screen star and ex-lover of Garbo, but here towards the end of his career. He is not completely convincing as a worthy object of her desires. He looks  popeyed and weedy. The film has 2 very famous scenes - when Garbo ""remembers"", filmed to the rhythm of a metronome, the room where she and Gilbert slept together and the ending at the bow of the ship when her blank face is scrutinised and the audience fill in the blanks. The film is sumptuously made in the MGM manner and there is an excellent supporting cast, particularly C Aubrey Smith.

The film's print is dirty and obviously unrestored. There are no extras except the original trailer so if you want to learn more, you will have to purchase it in one of the Garbo Collections which contain documentaries.",1182470400,,1617,4.726950354609929
403410,5,6301978374,"Mamoulian's film creaks a bit with some broad playing from secondary actors, but Garbo's luminosity more than makes up for it. She is not only ravishing, but her persona is tailor-made for the strong, mannish role of Christina. Former fianc Gilbert is also fine as Antonio, which places the subsequent demise of this actor's career squarely at the feet of studio boss L.B. Mayer, who didn't like him. Ian Keith, Lewis Stone, and C. Aubrey Smith lend skilled support in this, one of the screen's crowning early biopics.",1182384000,,518,4.8977272727272725
403411,3,6301978374,"As I continued my quest through Greta Garbo's career I came across this film, a big sweeping historical romance that has a pure heart but a very dry tongue. The story involves the Queen of Sweden (Garbo) who rules over a people that are not too bright and advisors that are constantly clamoring for war. Early on Christina calls off the war in the name of the peasants which leaves the warmongers frothing at the mouth. Decisions like this serve to make her character more likeable and little else as the political landscape she presides over has no real consequences. The romantic part of the story kicks in one night when Christian is out and about and gets marooned inside a cabin thanks to a massive snowfall. Also in the cabin are a bunch of drunken Spaniards, and one, Don Antonio (John Gilbert) who is especially attractive. The catch is that this guy believes she is a he, and since he believes it she seems to magically morph into a male. I know that if you need a she to play a he Garbo is your girl, but she makes no effort to hide her femininity so I found this scene to be extremely unlikely. But no matter. Once they are alone she is outed as a female but not as a queen, they fall in love and then must separate.

The thing about historical romances is that it is always the history driving the wedge between the lovebirds, be it a sinking ship or King Charles. So of course Don Antonio is the advisor to King Charles, and of course he has his royal eye on Christina. This all comes to pass when Don Antonio pays a visit to Christina's castle not knowing that she is queen. His presence has negative effects almost immediately. The masses, never known for their smarts, start riots outside over the thought of their queen doing it with a foreigner (who even knew Swedish nationalism existed?). Then, like now, the people were only able to take an interest in politics if it involved a sex scandal that they could be outraged (!) about. Her other lover around the castle gets jealous and we see lots of squabbling, an aspect that was reminiscent of the ""Elizabeth I"" movie from earlier this year. The ending of the film is actually quite refreshing. For once we see a person look around and realize that the cost of her position is more than she is interested in paying. We humans love to sell out without thinking, here Christina does the opposite. It was not enough to save the film for me. The dealings for castle politics got to be a drag fairly quickly. I also simply don't believe Garbo in this role. She always seems mysterious and haunting, not powerful and appealing. So while the film is perfectly enjoyable I'm giving it a mild thumbs down. I didn't believe the filmmakers when they told me that Christina rose above her position, but I did believe them when they told me she was leaving it. The sad thing is that there is a good movie in here somewhere, just director Rouben Mamoulian couldn't get the story engine humming fast enough to find it. ***",1164412800,3,2976,4.460550458715597
403463,5,6301978374,"In my view Garbo's greatest film, and her most personal. Among my other favorites are Camille and Ninotchka, but Queen Christina is her stand-out classic above all others. I have read that  Garbo  was personally exicted by and involved in this production to an extent unparalled for her, motivated by the Swedish (her homeland) history and the opportunity to play one of history's most enigmatic figures, the queen who ""abdicated her throne for love"" (though this portrayal is, of course, largely ""Hollywoodized""--you can probably throw most expectations of  historical accuracy out the window, just set back and behold).

  Here is every aspect of the legendary Garbo in one film: the breathtakingly beautiful woman, the amibiguous sexuality, the great tragienne, the aloofness, the boyish playfulness, the restless longing to escape any enforced tableaux or expectations of others and live her own life by her own terms, all things she had in common with Queen Christina. Here also is her warm, memorable final pairing with her former real-life amor and frequent co-star John Gilbert.

  Two legendary scenes stand out: Garbo walking about, as if in a daze, memorizing the inn room in which she and Gilbert have just spent the night (a scene almost lost due to censors), and of course the final, unforgettable closeup, the greatest closeup in the history of cinema--simply stunning, as is the heartbreaking farewell to the dying Gilbert moments before. Not to be missed scenes also are Garbo running out of the castle into the bitter cold, rubbing snow in her face like a child, and the warm relationship with her elderly attendant, C. Aubrey Smith, who dotes on her like a daughter, combing her hair, tending to her every need with tender love and protectiveness. --One of the overlooked subtexts in the film is the parentless Christina's relationships with two major father figures, Lewis Milestone (another frequent co-star) as a palace official, who vehemently protests Christina's decision to step down from the throne, along with the personal attendant, C. Aubrey Smith, with his benevolent, Mark Twain face, caring for Christina in a motherly fashion, wanting only her happiness, wherever that takes her....

  In life Garbo indeed appeared reclusive and aloof, though I suspect she was simply a very shy person who perhaps never fully comprehended what it was we all wanted from her. But here, in Queen Christina, actress and woman merge. Garbo opened up for us in a way she had never before and would never again, fully showing us both her great strength and acute vulnerability, and the result is spellbinding, a treasure forever, Garbo's gift to us all, and we are all the beneficiaries.",1151712000,25,2700,5.09750566893424
403464,4,6301978374,"An irregular, though in the end, definitely great Garbo vehicle.

It is shocking to note how our impression of a film changes along with the time. Ten or fifteen years ago I considered ""Queen Christina"" Garbo's best work. Today I am not so sure, to my regret and disappointment.

The failure, in my opinion, stands in the over-presence, idolizing of the Garbo image, so much so that the plot, script, everything else practically becomes irrelevant. Can the weight of the great, (wonderful, I must admit) Garbo balance neatly with the quality of the picture? No. The movie starts weak, pretentious, a little theatrical, then it grows in tone, more ambition and a little more depth; towards the end one feels you have been watching a wonderful movie all through and can't get your eyes off the screen. And that's when she acts her greatest scene: on the ship, facing the mysterious horizon, with the sea breeze on her sphinx face, and her eyes... oh, her eyes!

Yeah, folks. This is classic cinema, and I'm not whistling dixie here. It's all worth it, only for those culminating minutes. And as one cannot separate an arm from a body and expect to grow from it another body, one cannot separate the end from the rest of the film. That is why this is a great classic movie.

N.B. I wonder if Christina ever made it to the ""house on the cliff"" in Spain. Sad and beautiful Spain.",1143244800,2,1374,4.595918367346939

403466,3,6301978374,"I have to be a contrarian about this film.  As a ""star  vehicle"" I suppose it's OK -- Garbo is in practically every scene & certainly displays all the qualities of a glamour queen.  But the film itself is otherwise pathetic -- where to begin?  Ham-fisted direction, uniformly awful supporting cast (who was their dialogue coach?  They all speak in the same wooden, portentious tones), out-of-period  make-up, poor camera angles, curiously truncated scenes (why is the fatal sword fight so short??).  Surprisingly, I thought John Gilbert was not too bad, though he is clearly too old for the part & his eye-liner makes him look like a silent film actor who wandered onto the set by mistake -- but that's mostly because the rest of the supporting players are so bad.",1129420800,3,764,4.786259541984733

Being Swedish and an old Greta Garbo admirer I very much enjoyed all her old movies but especially Queen Christina.  I only wish that a sequel of Queen Christina's life after abdication would have been filmed because she was quite an extraordinary woman and I would have loved seing Greta Garbo in that role.  Queen Christina defied the stuffy rulers of Sweden, abdicated and went on her journey to Rome in order to practice catholosism which at that time was a crime punished by execution in Sweden.  In Rome, she accomplished great things and lived a very interesting life.",1128729600,,644,4.672566371681416
403468,3,6301978374,"It's pretty unanimous that the hypnotism of Garbo's acting and charisma were consistent even in her lesser films where nothing else made the films worth watching.  Queen Christina, however, is always touted as an excellent MOVIE with perfect casting and bristling dialogue.  I'm an old movies fan and a Garbo fan, but I guess I'm alone in feeling Queen Christina is OVERRATED.  I'm not knocking Garbo's acting or anything, because as always, it's of the highest caliber.  But the script is dry and crawls with all the gourmet taste of a mouthful of sawdust.  John Gilbert, once a dashing hero of the screen, looks about a hundred and twenty years too old for the part of Antonio.  Oh, if I only had a thaler for every wrinkle on his face...(sigh)

The most awkward pill of all for me to swallow whenever I trudge through this cranky old costumer is that Garbo fools everyone at the inn into thinking she is a man.  What the hell?  I have tried squinting my eyes every way I know how, turning the sound down, and shotgunning a hearty grog, but I just can't see it.  She walks like a man okay, but Adrian, that elusive costume guy who always turns up in the credits, OR SOMEONE, should have put her in more convincing clothes and nixed the lipstick and eyelashes.

This movie reminds me of Hitchcock's WORST films - even they have a few really riveting scenes, cinematography-wise, but the rest of the film is a cotton-dry bore.",1126483200,5,1426,4.574803149606299

Oh I could go on forever... However, boiled down to the essentials, she had a charismatic, photogenic face, BUT SHE NEVER DEPENDED ON PROMOTING HERSELF: MGM and fellow artists and critics sang their rhapsodies and privately I suspect she overdosed quickly of the SuperStar-label and became bored with the whole idea. I think she felt she was overpraised much too early in her career and felt embarassed by the never-ending attention.

In Queen Christina she is beautifully lit and photographed(and from 1927 on - she was filmed behind closed curtains...with only William Daniels and Karl Freund close at hand)...

I would say that many an actress with that attention could have easily have filled her shoes. She was a timid actress. Cukor once observed that he felt she had to be thrown into the action - she never created. Seeing her with Constance Bennett in TWO-FACED WOMAN og Charles Boyer in CONQUEST, you`ll see that she can`t reach their standard in  scenes she is forced to act and interplay - and not merely pose and being brilliantly photographed in close-up.

In QUEEN CHRISTINA she is a MOVIESTAR, not an actress...

So who would I define the ultimate star of the 20th century? ELIZABETH TAYLOR; for all her brilliant performances(and bad 1s), her legendary life and beauty...  Now, Miss Taylor is what A MOVIESTAR AND A GREAT MOVIEACTRESS is all about...",1109635200,2,1549,4.957528957528957
403470,5,6301978374,"I loved this film, the only talking picture of the great Gilbert/Garbo team.  (You note I put his name first, because it appears like that in their three silent films!)
Contrary to the first review in this section, which states that Mr. Gilbert is almost ""laughable"" (?) in his role, I think his performance is excellent, like Ms. Garbo's, certainly better than Ian Keith's.  You can actually see on screen the great love that once existed between the two during all their classic, great silent films, and the chemistry is still there.  Makes one wish she had accepted one of his several (real) marriage proposals!
I am sick and tired of seeing Mr. Gilbert being maligned; he was one of the silent screen's best actors; his teaming with Ms. Garbo is timeless; and due to the machinations of a ""person"" named Louis B. Mayer, his career was deliberately ruined for several reasons, e.g. personal animosity between the two men (which twice led to blows), highest salaried contract,  relationship w/Ms. Garbo, etc.  Once and for all, let us finally put an end to the ""voice"" myth and realize the truth!
In summary, Ms. Garbo is perfect and she is here reunited with her perfect leading man.  Just as in the three silent films they made together, this one is a classic which will be remembered forever. Never again did she have a co-star so ""perfect"" with her.
P.S.  To the person who wrote ""laughable"":  Ever hear about ""The Big Parade"" - maybe you should take a look at it to see how excellent an actor Mr. Gilbert was, and definitely view all of the Gilbert/Garbo silents.  You'll learn a lot.",1043193600,6,1591,4.673835125448028
403471,5,6301978374,"This is a vastly entertaining film about the enigmatic, cross dressing, 17th Century Queen of Sweden, who abdicated her throne for love of a Spaniard, the Spanish Envoy to the Swedish Court, Don Antonio De La Prada. The film follows their romance from their first chance meeting through their full blown love affair to its final tragic conclusion. Real life is often stranger than fiction.
Greta Garbo, a native of Sweden, is positively glorious as this most unusual of Queens, giving a performance that is intelligent, complex, and passionate, with a touch of whimsy interjected. John Gilbert, Garbo's real life, handsome ex-lover, is excellent in the part of Don Antonio, a man conflicted by his mission on behalf of his king and his passion for Christina.
Queen Christina, too, is conflicted, as she does not wish to enter into a political marriage of convenience with Swedish war hero, Prince Charles Gustavus (Reginald Owen). This is the marriage that the people of Sweden seem to want and one that is being fostered by both her Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna (Lewis Stone), and her former lover, Count Magnus (Ian Keith). Nor does she wish to marry the Spanish King. Instead, she wishes to marry for love. So, she does the unthinkable. She abdicates for love, creating shock waves that reverberate throughout the courts of Europe, and arranges to leave her native Sweden with Don Antonio and head for Spain.
The best-laid plans, however, often go awry. Jealousy rears its ugly head, when Count Magnus realizes that his affair with Christina is over and that Don Antonio now has her affection. It is he who throws the final monkey wrench into their plans to live happily ever after. Who, having seen this film, can forget Garbo's last scene as Christina, the Queen who lost everything in the final analysis: her throne, her lover, and her future. Her last close-up in this film is unforgettable and one that will long linger in the memory of the viewer. Never was Garbo more luminous or soulful.

This film has a dated artificial look to it.  The sets LOOK LIKE SETS, and the action often feels stagy and claustrophobic, as if it were conducted on one of MGM's cumbersome sound stages (which it was).
However, ""Queen Christina"" is worth seeing because of the sheer pleasure that the ever effervescent Garbo generates through her skillful portrayal of the eccentric monarch.  Garbo on screen never fails to captivate.  She is often better than the movies she appears in.

In many ways, I believe that this film has a sense of modernity to it because of the way her character is written including various undertones as well as her monologue when finally making the choice. Some of the dialogue has poetic sensibility which added another layer of uniqueness to the film for me personally.

Many have already stated the personal lives of Garbo and Gilbert, but I purchased this film because I enjoyed their chemistry in Flesh and the Devil and the story sounded intriguing. While it's possible their chemistry in this film may have been sourced from their own prior relationship, it would be absurd to think audiences would learn about the actors' identity and lives off screen by watching this film.
