Four stars is the best rating I give a film that isn't a masterpiece, so this one comes recommended. There's a little of ""The Closer"" vibe about this movie, with Zimbalist as the newcomer with a different technique from her colleagues. It has a psychological throughline -- not a lot of noisy action or grisly scenes (which is fine with me) but an interesting investigative story.",1379808000,3,487,4.867469879518072

I saw this movie in 1991 as I was a big Remington Steele fan. That show had ended in 1987. I recall this was touted as a possible series for Zimbalist, tv movies often served as pilots, and I was so disappointed it didn't get picked up. This was the same year as Silence of the Lambs so profiling was all the rage. At the time I didn't think the episodes of chauvinism were that over the top--have you seen Prime Suspect (which started the same year)? Life was very different for women 20 years ago.

496097,3,6302679036,"For me, this film is a valentine from Stephanie to her (recently deceased in May) father, Ephraim Zimbalist, jr. In their Remington Steele eps together,  you can see she loved working with him.  He was best known for his ten year portrayal of an FBI agent. The FBI context seems unnecessary and tacked on until it's understood as a tip-of-the-hat to her father.
I may value Stephanie's film presence a little more because I know how hard it is to look normal on a screen. Real ""normal"" people on screen look funny and weird; but Stephanie achieves precisely that. She's not  some gorgeous cartoonish knockout pretending to be an average schoolteacher or whatever by wearing fake glasses. She's attractive in a normal, dignified way.
This could have been trimmed of 70's true detective grit cliche characters in favor of amplifying the twisted internal life of the villian. Tony Bill is entirely capable of that. But they play positively to Stephanie.",1404950400,,950,4.925
496098,2,6302679036,Like so many other movies of the genre. Nothing special or recommendable about it. A waste of time! Stephanie Zimbalist can be good...but not in this.,1402704000,,150,4.8076923076923075

496191,2,6302679036,The storyline was quite good but the actors appeared somewhat wooden and unbelievable.  Amusing enough to watch the whole thing but don't expect great art...more like a pilot for a sticom that didn't make the cut.,1401408000,,213,4.916666666666667
496192,2,6302679036,"Watched this because I was curious to see Stephanie Zimbalist. But the movie is quite dated, and full of cliches. If you are really bored, it is watchable, but don't expect a whole lot! It is not a half bad plot, but it is executed in a very campy and predictable way. Keep that in mind, and have some popcorn handy.",1400198400,,316,4.19672131147541
496193,2,6302679036,"ok, many other reviewers have gone over the fact that this film is bad.  to do that again here would almost be taking pot-shots at something that seems to have been made with no intention to be good.  what this is, or looks like, is a 1980s (yeah, 1991 but the style extended past the decade) made-for-tv film, possibly a pilot for a show, in the genre that I tend to call ""Women Abuse Network"" movies.  you know the style--the fragile dame is stalked, and must find some inner resource, clue, or something to identify her stalker.  these are about women, but the woman never really figures it out until almost the very end, so you can't say that they are exactly Feminist pieces.
at any rate, what I would like to highlight about this movie is something that may vaguely interest those who are into old, unsolved crimes.  the murder that the detective focuses on steals nearly all of its details from a very infamous Hollywood murder from the 1940s.  if you are in any way familiar with the murder of Elizabeth Short (luridly called by that day's press ""The Black Dahlia"") this movie is basically ABOUT that crime, and includes a lot of my personal thought processes on that murder.  It is a crime that I have long been interested in, because the poor woman was buried in a cemetery in my hometown which happens to be one of my favorite spots on earth (designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, of Central Park fame), and I learned from an artist friend that I was inadvertently walking over this poor woman's grave.  That, plus I'm an aficionado of unsolved crimes.
Will this movie 'solve' that crime for you?  Well, no...of course not.  But this particular crime, and its details, haunt more than just the Hollywood streets where it may have occurred.  details of the murder itself, the woman who was killed, and so on pop up ALL over the place in very famous films.  nearly every David Lynch film uses or references this crime in some way, with some characters even intentionally made up to look like her (Rosellini's character in Blue Velvet specifically).  True Confessions is a non-lynch film that uses the details of this crime, and Mulholland Falls somewhat obliquely references it as well as many others. So, knowing the details of the crime as I do, I like to play ""Spot the Dahlia"" when I watch Hollywood films, and this one has it written all over it, right down to the newspaper reporter who is the walking encyclopedia for the murder (there is an actual former LA Times editor who has become one of the main authorities on this actual crime, but I won't name him here).
So, if you're really really bored one evening and don't mind wasting your life on a totally crappy movie, AND are interested in the Dahlia killing, this one is for you.",1399593600,,2747,4.570264765784114
496194,4,6302679036,"A lot of bad reviews for this movie. It does start out pretty campy and slow, but gets really good about half way through it. Really good jazz soundtrack (if you like the old 50's/60's movie jazz",1397865600,,195,4.297297297297297

496196,3,6302679036,"Zimbalist plays a new detective Sargent in an elite group of the LAPD.  Formerly a FBI profiler, she joins a unit that solves cases that other divisions find difficult to close.

The acting is almost amateurish, though partly from an awkward script.  And while I like Stephanie Zimbalist, she's never had much range as an actor.

What was especially distracting, however, was the continual barrage of harassment and disdain directed at SK because she was a woman.  Her character is a professional looking FBI agent who joins the LA murder squad.  Some sexism would be make sense.  But it's so cartoonish, it comes across almost as a running gag.  For viewers under 40, it may seem ridiculous.  For those of us over 40, it's distracting, at best.
