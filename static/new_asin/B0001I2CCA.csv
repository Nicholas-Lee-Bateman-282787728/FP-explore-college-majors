8012796,1,B0001I2CCA,"I just watched this with a friend of mine, and we agreed that George ""Goober"" Lindsey and
Foster Brooks were funny, but nobody else was. Weak humor by and large, we thought, but if
you're a fan of the other comedians, go for it. Surprisingly, Jeff Foxworthy wasn't funny, either -
he got better later, I guess.",1380153600,2,310,4.456140350877193
