8241512,3,B0011E9B5E,"Based on a true story, ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" stars the talented Julie Delpy as Jeanne Cooley who moves with her husband Guy [Justin Theroux], and daughters Molly [Kathleen Regan] and Lucy [Cassidy Hinkle] to rural New England, specifically the town of Princeton, MA where Guy is working on a windmill project under the supervision of local councilwoman Samantha Porter [Brooke Adams]. Before long, the Cooleys discover that quite a few of the townspeople are not in favor of the project and make their objections known, specifically Gretchen Caswell [Jamie Donnelly] who is the unofficial keeper of the town's heritage, and hostile/creepy next-door neighbor Jonas Dodd.

Jeanne who is also grieving the tragic death of her youngest daughter, keeps hearing a woman's voice from the woods, a voice that seems to be calling out for something she has lost, and as Jeanne digs into the history of the old farmhouse they occupy, she discovers the mysterious disappearance of 6-year-old Lucy Keyes back in the 1700s, and how the tragedy caused her mother to go almost insane. The rest of the movie revolves around Jeanne trying to solve the mystery of the disembodied voice and figuring out her own daughter's [Lucy] role in the mystery.

The movie is actually quite engaging and well-made, despite being more of a made-for-TV type of show. The production qualities are impressive, with beautiful cinematography of the lush New England landscape. The acting is also quite credible, especially Julie Delpy's grieving/conflicted mother, who shares a strong affinity with her younger daughter, reminiscent of Lucy Keyes' own deep bond with her mother. Justin Theroux does not really impress in his role as the husband/father, remaining a secondary character for most of the movie. The other stand-out performance was by the little girl who plays Lucy Cooley. She is not only adorable but is also credible in her role without being annoying. The guy who plays the creepy neighbor also does a good job.

The special effects are nothing to shout about, and this is not a scary movie. It is more of a supernatural thriller with more suspense elements than real horror, which makes it a decent family drama. Recommended for fans of supernatural-themed dramas.",1310515200,,2249,5.0894308943089435
