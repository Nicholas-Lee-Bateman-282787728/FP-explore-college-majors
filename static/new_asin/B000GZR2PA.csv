8135492,5,B000GZR2PA,"We first saw this movie at the theater, and didn't truly understand what was going on because there were no subtitles. After I bought it and watched it with subtitles, I loved it! This movie really makes you think; its completely unpredictable. The songs were great, the story line was complex. This movie reminded me of 'Malice' with Bill Pullman and Demi Moore because of all the twists and turns.",1297382400,,399,4.714285714285714
