8387319,5,B00320AB5O,"I've literally been looking for this for several years. I'd bought it for my mom from Wal-Mart and I loved it so much that when I moved out I wanted to get my own. Wal-Mart didn't have it anymore, I couldn't remember what it was called, mom had her copy in storage at that point. Years and years later after MANY, MANY searches, I FINALLY found it from this seller and at such a great price. It arrived brand new (or at least like brand new, can't remember if advertised as brand new) and now I can enjoy it whenever I want.",1466640000,,524,4.147058823529412
8387320,5,B00320AB5O,"This is very beautiful and very relaxing, Love it!",1463616000,,50,4.666666666666667
8387321,5,B00320AB5O,"As the other reviewer said - I picked this up on a whim.  It's become a winter favorite.  I always seem to want to play this during the worst of winter.  The images and music are so relaxing and compelling.

I listen to a lot of New Age music and a lot of it is trivial.  This is deeper and more mature than the usual stuff.",1323734400,,324,3.8484848484848486
8387322,5,B00320AB5O,"I picked this up on a whim and it has turned out to be a household favorite for unwinding at the end of the day. My 3 year old grandson calls it ""waddie falls"" and asks for it just before bedtime. The music is more complex than your typical canned elevator music. The scenes and lighting are interesting yet soothing to the eye. Without a doubt, worth having on hand.",1316649600,3,367,4.257142857142857
