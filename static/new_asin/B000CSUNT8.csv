8102065,4,B000CSUNT8,"With his own ""Code Of Honor"", a lone wolf does his best to control, and evade people in order to survive reality his way.  There are countless ways Robson Green gives us a very complex character as Steve McTear. He can be verbally or physically brutal one moment, then gentle. and caring in his own way. There are several surprises as the drama unfolds and you can't help root for McTear to succeed in his quest to be whoever he really is?  I'm a USA Robson Green fan, and he continued to apply his special acting skills in a versatile and dynamic way in this film.  Rita K.",1390867200,,574,4.296296296296297
8102066,5,B000CSUNT8,I was touched by this moving story of a family dealing with alcoholism and the struggles of addiction. It's a must see indie that has won a bunch of awards. Check it out; you will be moved.,1357776000,,189,4.135135135135135
8102067,3,B000CSUNT8,"How does a guy from the poor side of town find himself on a fencing team?
Like a lot of martial arts, they are taught in American public schools, but can be found in prep school for the rich upper class kids?
Here the hero is a fencing coach ( substitute) at an expensive private school in a castle on the beach front in Scotland.
He is on the run from his London criminal associates because of a lie told by one of them. His future seems really dim...
I liked the movie, but the acting and plot seem pretty unlikely to me.",1245456000,2,523,4.087378640776699
8102068,5,B000CSUNT8,The movie was fantastic and got here in record time.  I know I can go to Amazon and get products you can't find anywhere else.  Robson Green is a god.,1178755200,4,150,3.966666666666667
8102069,5,B000CSUNT8,"It's the quintessential school of rock story, but more about the teacher and his issues than the students themselves.  Plus a love story to boot.  That said I don't know that I would call this a chick flick, though it does have Robson Green (yum).  It's got wonderful acting, strong story plot and people that actually fence, not actors that learned for the role (or so it appears to me).  Very unique story out of the UK, that I think that everyone would enjoy.",1177632000,6,462,4.464285714285714
