7955817,5,B00005V1XS,"This DVD (One on One Strength Training) is good in what it does - present clear instructions for 20 weight training exercises, plus appropriate stretches for each body part. Douglas Brooks does not have the massive physique of a professional bodybuilder; he is a fitness trainer with a master's degree in exercise physiology. Without rushing things, he demonstrates these movements (plus a couple variations for most):
- Chest press
- Dumbbell row
- Crunches
- Lat pullover
- Leg curl
- Chest flye
- Upright row (I suggest not using a bar, using only dumbbells, never raising above shoulder level, and keeping DBs at least shoulder width apart to avoid impingement.)
- Squat
- Lateral shoulder flye
- Hip abduction
- Hip adduction
- Overhead press
- Spinal extension
- Tricep dip
- Rotator cuff rotations (internal & external)
- Reverse curl
- Calf raise
- Tricep press
- Dorsi flexion
- Bicep curl.

As you can see, this is a well rounded selection of exercises. I appreciate that Brooks also demonstrates stretches for each muscle group. Moreover, Brooks is spot on in emphasizing a neutral spine alignment to reduce the risk of injury, something beginners often ignore. The DVD is well indexed with 39 chapter stops - a nice plus.

I'm glad to see rotator cuff exercises and stretches presented. Rotator cuff injuries can happen to swimmers, tennis players, baseball pitchers and even desk workers who use a mouse most of the workday. Additionally, many guys in the gym who bench press excessively (and avoid back and shoulder exercises) often suffer painful rotator cuff traumas. Materials aimed at beginners seldom address this topic, and Brooks gets big points for including rotator cuff exercises/stretches.

Beginners can follow the DVD several times to learn the lifts. The numerous index points let you easily navigate to the segment you want. After learning the lifts, most will not use this as a workout DVD. The pacing is too slow for intermediates - the DVD is best for those in the learning phase.

It is a trivial point, but Brooks' apparel and mullet hairdo are reminiscent of the 1970's disco era, making the DVD seem more dated than its year of production (2001). Camera work is usually good. Production values are spartan - there is no ""music video"" energy that you might want in a workout video. (If your are just watching, the video is boring. I suggest grabbing your dumbbells to learn while doing.)

Bottom Line: The content is clear and will help people learn the basics. Worthy of ****1/2 for its clear instructions, large variety of lifts and sensible inclusion of stretches for each body part. The price (under $10 in April 2011) makes this a great value. The DVD's content and pace are geared more to instruction than to motivation. I suggest getting a couple good weight training books from Amazon or your local library since any DVD will be less comprehensive than written guides.",1303430400,2,2911,4.884615384615385

State of the DVD: As it strucks at some places I couldn't watch continously. I'm using the workout menu to complete the DVD.",1186358400,,198,4.685714285714286
7955820,2,B00005V1XS,"While Douglas Brooks puts out some of the best books on resistance training (which I would highly recommend), this DVD is not a good example of his advice.  In fact, there are several moves that are he says are ""contraindicated"" in his book that he includes on the DVD, which is rather dated (notice Brooks' mullet 'do!)",1096588800,10,320,4.614035087719298
