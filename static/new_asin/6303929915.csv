734330,5,6303929915,"At the beginning of the practice there should be warm up exercises first. These are quite simple and enjoyable. They are not the Chi Gong, but will leave you feeling relaxed and balanced right from the beginning. After that Linda demonstrates 8 treasures of Chi Gong - 8 movements. I have not mastered them all yet. But even doing the few I know gives me a lot of satisfaction.
At first it was hard to concentrate and get in tune with the movements. I did not want to give up. There is something very soothing and enchanting about the music, movements and Linda's quiet mastery that kept me coming back to watching the tape and repeating exercises with the tape.
Eventually the moment came, quite unexpectedly, when it started feeling like meditaion in motion. The results in the feeling of calmness and relaxation felt amazing.
It takes time and patience. Allow yourself for some time to get the right results. I cannot even imagine how good it could get practiced daily, for a life time. For me it is just the beginning.
All the best to you on a quite road to Chi Gong mastery. Try it in nature rather than at home. The good Chi of the nature's surroundings makes quite a difference in helping your own Chi to flow and grow.",994809600,20,1226,4.502242152466367
734419,1,6303929915,"I just watched this video for the first time. The first half hour shows the demonstrator doing the chi exercises to soft music. You have no clue what she is doing, or why.
  The second half shows instructions on the warm up exercises and movements. The instructor is standing in front of a small class of participants and explaining the warm up movements. Her mouth is moving, but there is ABSOLUTELY NO VERBAL SOUND on my video. So, you still have no clue what you are doing or why. Is my video defective or are all of yours the same? You can hear the nice music, but absolutely no talking. Ok, I was totally lost and don't think I will ever use this video.
  I would appreciate hearing from others who own this video. Is there and talking/ audible verbal instructions on yours???",1190160000,,781,4.440559440559441
734420,5,6303929915,"A key point to remember is that Qigong takes practice and perseverance, but it is fun doing something new and deriving the benefits of this ancient healing art form. Cohen's book (mentioned in another review) is good  and filled with more information than one might ever need, but it is very comprehensive...like a small encyclopedia of Qigong. There are thousands of forms that have been created over the thousands of years Qigong has been practiced. Linda's program is very gentle and excellent for beginners. There are other, more martial arts oriented Qigong forms. I've heard it said that the root of all martial arts is Qigong. If you have a background in martial arts, or want to focus your program contiguous with martial arts then Discovering Chi will disappoint. But for a beginner to get started and then move into a more martial arts orientation, you can't go wrong with Discovering Chi.

Some folks have complained about the formatting of the video tape (and dvd too) in that there are no markers to easily locate segments of the tape. While this is a bit irritating I found that after one becomes moderately proficient with each movement and the warm-up one can simply follow the program from the beginning of the tape. It took me about ten times. Now I have the warm-ups well in hand (not difficult at all) and I can simply rewind back to the beginning and follow the routine. If additional practice is needed on any one movement then I can practice it several times and the rewind time is insignificant. I very much enjoy the relaxed nature of Linda's program and teaching. I feel fortunate and blessed to have found this program as my first experience with Qigong Ta'i Chi.",1183593600,,1690,4.744897959183674
734421,3,6303929915,"The information in this DVD is excellent. A great place to start researching and practicing qigong. Linda Modaro is an excellent instructor and demonstrator. A complete set of exercises for someone at any level.

However, the DVD is a direct copy of the VHS tape with the minor addition of language selection. The whole DVD is one long run just like the tape it was copied from. There is no menu to allow the viewer to select an exercise to view, no links to each exercise to allow for easy study.

In my opinion, this is a ridiculous waste of technical potential. A straight copy to DVD was a criminally lazy thing to do. It could not have been that difficult to add a convenient menu to allow the viewer to easily navigate this DVD. They got only three stars from me because they made this difficult to use.

If you want a very good set of qigong exercises, this is it. But expect to wade through a lot of things you don't want to see as you are learning the exercises. Expect to endure a tedious search if you wish to review how to do a specific exercise. DVDs are no longer new technology. Even in China the producers should have known better and done better.",1142294400,19,1163,4.350230414746544
734422,2,6303929915,"My DVD arrived promptly and when I placed it in my DVD player the language was chinese!!!!!  Not only can I not read how to get to the different sections, once I accidently do get to a section, I can't understand what is being said. Somewhere it should say in the product information that this is not in English. I can follow the actions on the video but knowing the language would be helpful.",1142035200,8,393,4.3108108108108105
734423,4,6303929915,"I am 71 and a beginner.  I think the lessons are very good, but I would like to see the warmup exercises at the beginning of the tape.  The DVD is rather hard to navigate....so I have to wait until the tape gets to the warm up....or fast forward and hope I stop at the right place.  Rather a pain....but the exerise is very good once you get to where you want to be.

734424,5,6303929915,"My 2002 VHS Review (more reviews at the VHS version):
I bought this & didn't touch it for several months. I did finally when I had a major migraine complete w/stomach pain, etc. By the time I was done, unbelievably, I was fine. No symptoms & I felt great other then a little tired from normal exercise. Even though all this, I still did not use it again until I was very dizzy from a flu. Again, I was cured of the dizziness, but of course not the flu. I didn't expect a total miracle. I continued to use it during my flu & I feel more energized/better each time. It was hard to at first to complete the warm-up and the 8 moves, but it's worth it. Definitely don't stop after starting the moves. Returning the Chi is VERY important or you'll feel tired still. Feel free to take small breaks in between if need to. I'm going to buy all her other ones since this has worked so well. I am always so calm & energized afterwards.

Though the only menu options is English or Mandarin, the sound is done in 5.1 digital. I have continued to use it whenever I don't feel well & have added to my Qi Gong library. This one is one of the least boring & has the most information on it in terms of what organs it works on, the benefits & especially she is the greatest in teaching about every detail on how to stand, where to place your hands, etc.
The first part is her doing the Qi Gong movements alone w/her voice over key points only (as a quicker workout & less chatty review after you've mastered the teaching detailed portion) for 26 min w/soothing background music that is used throughout the dvd.
The warm-up is next for about 15 min, done in a studio with about 10 students male & female 20s-40s different races. It has light stretching of the neck, waist, knees & ankles, it works on the heart, lungs, nervous system, digestive, etc. The camera is on her 7/8 of the time, focusing on whatever body part she is explaining, so don't worry that you'll be lost.
Next is her teaching the students the 8 Qi Gong movements for 37 min w/plenty of info of foot placement, what organs/body systems each movement works on, how Chinese Medicine explains why it helps, etc. They are simple movements that almost anyone can do & if you're wheel bound, you can just do the best you can. In Energy Medicine, just the intention of thought helps to heal almost as much as actually doing it. If you rarely exercise or out of shape like I used to be, take breaks. If you're in good shape, this will be easy, but you'll still feel the stretch, but never boring.
For anyone who bores easily, this & Qi Gong Practice for Beginners is one of the more faster hand/leg movements to keep your mind wandering.
I notice the more healing I get from a Qi Gong video, the harder it gets as I go. I feel a heavy resistance like as if I'm exhausted, but I'm not. This one as well as Dr. Yang, Jwing-Mings, & ""Chi Kung: The Healing Workout"" w/Jerry Alan Johnson I felt the most healing w/Gaiam's QiGong w/Francesco + Daisy Lee Garripoli right after.  ""Qigong-Guide to Well Being"" is a dvd I tried, was very short & only has SOME of the warm up exercises here.

The DVD is in English & in Chinese language choices, just make the choice at the main screen.
On Amazon's page for Discovering Chi's 4 pack DVD set comments, Linda Modero personally wrote she contacted the production crew & they promised that all the future DVDs will have better menu choices & soon more language choices. She even will replace the DVD of anyone's that didn't have chapter choices. Email her at lindamodaro AT earthlink net",1139011200,18,3563,4.354887218045112
734425,5,6303929915,"When I first watched the DVD I didn't like it too much. It was shot in a studio and it looks just like a Chi Gong class in any gym. It is not the best audiovisual product. I also have the other 3 DVDs of the series and they're shot outside and are a lot more appealling.

However, Linda is a very special communicator; she gets to you. She is obviously an expert in Chi Gong but she gives you only the right amount of information as you do the exercises. I've been working with the 1st DVD for over a month and I've already noticed improvement in my flexibility (my back hasn't bothered me once) and my general mood.

As you work out through the exercises you're being told that one exercise is good for your digestion, or this other one is good to help you keep focused, etc. Once you've listened to the instructions enough you can do the routine with only music.

I'm looking forward to being ready to move the 2nd DVD. I've watched but it looks more difficult. Since my patience has improved from doing Linda's routine, I'm gonna wait till I'm really ready to progress.",1133568000,17,1072,4.323383084577115
734426,3,6303929915,"If your into martial arts, and think this video is going to turn you into a Ninja with the death touch, your gonna be disappointed. It shows some exercises you do to improve your health and well being. It was the only video that I could find on the subject so I bought it. I tried a few of the exercises, and you can feel your chi flowing because of them, otherwise my video sits and gathers dust until I get more time to practice what's on it.",1039824000,3,444,4.056818181818182
734427,5,6303929915,"It's been ages since I used this tape. So I forgot how good the warm-up excercises made me feel. But this morning I pulled it from the shelf and gave it another try. To be honest, I haven't even come close to mastering all the instructions on this video. But the warm-up alone will make you feel great. And I hope to use this tape more often. Why and how does it work? Who can say? I just know that I feel better and more relaxed. I sincerely hope it does the same for you.",1005436800,12,473,3.9894736842105263

When I select a language, the disc launches into the content. The next-chapter button does nothing. I wish I could get this content along with a menu for selecting excercies, and where the next-chapter button worked. They must be aware of these problems by now. Does anyone know whether there is an updated and corrected version of this disc? If I could get that, I would change the rating to five stars.",1403913600,4,575,4.485714285714286
