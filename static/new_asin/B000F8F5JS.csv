8118880,4,B000F8F5JS,"Andrzej Zulawski's films are receiving a lot of critical attention because of retrospectives of his career being staged on both coasts. This 2000 adaptation of Princess of Cleves is said to be about the break-up of the director's 15 year relationship with Sophie Marceau. Whether this is true or not, this is a fascinating portrait of a relationship and a world in peril. That said Zulawski is known for his excesses and this film contains several moments that border on (perhaps intentional) self-parody. At over three hours, this is for fans of unusual cinematic fare who have the patience and time to consider powerful cinematic visions. Zulawski is one of the few director's whose cinema seems more than mere entertainment, but rather a place to work out those things that most deeply and personally concern him. His films are so intense that the occasional moments of self-parody come as welcome moments of relief.

We meet Clelia (Sophie Marceau) as she travels by train from London to Paris where she is to begin a new career as a photographer for a French magazine with a reputation for exploiting salacious scandal (and Zulawski allows us plenty of opportunities to consider the corrosive affect these media practices have on modern society). The owner of the magazine is Rupert MacRoi who we learn at one time had an affair with Clelia's now ailing mother (and so could possibly be her father). Clelia's roots are humble (her mother was a cabaret singer who apparently had many affairs and one of her possible fathers was a vaudevillian performer) and since so many characters mention that people never outgrow their roots we can't help but think Zulawski is urging us to consider this as a theme. But whether this is true or whether people (esp the highborn) just like to believe its true, is a question that Zulawski teases us with but never resolves (just as he never resolves the mystery of her father and thus allows us to consider her past as well as her future as an open and unwritten book). Soon after she arrives in Paris, Clelia is interviewed by a rather nasty journalist who criticizes her work for being cold and unfeeling. Still numb from the interiew, she escapes into her own work photographing flowers in a shop window (a subject that is much more conventional and much more romantic than her previous work)  and its there she meets the much older (and perhaps fatherly) Cleve, one of the highborn, whose family business is books. It almost seems as if she is drawn to him because he represents everything she and the modern world lack (ie integrity, rootedness). Cleve and Clelia share an almost instant animal attraction and they immediately go back to his place to consummate that attraction. But soon after that chance meeting, she also meets Nemo, a photographer closer to her own age, who also works for MacRoi. Just as she was with Cleve, Clelia is intimate with Nemo within minutes of meeting him. From this we learn that she is sensual and impulsive but also emotionally disconnected. Throughout the course of the film she moves between the tender Cleve and his magnificent house which is a book-and-art-lined bastion of old world culture (and its the way Zulawski imbues interiors with almost totemic significance that prompt critics to think of Tarkovsky); and the hyper-active Nemo who exists wholly in the present and thrives on the thrill of the chase (Nemo's death obsession and the way Zulawski shoots violence recall Donald Cammell). Clelia can't seem to decide which man and which age/temperament she belongs to. Impulsively, she marries Cleve before she has decided who she wants to be and what kind of life she wants to live and this causes marital problems immediately.

Zulawski is not known for his artistic subtlety, and its easy to see why. He is an art-house director but one who seems to be experiencing a perpetual identity and genre crisis. Portions of this film fit the art-house mold but some do not. In the art-house portions he comes across as a psychological realist with a talent for nuanced portraiture. But in other portions of the film he comes across as someone who likes to toy with genre and the viewer expectations associated with genre. The scenes with Cleve are pure art house fare; the scenes with Nemo are grindhouse thriller. Zulawski is very good at showing what a viscerally alive and easily distracted creature Clelia is (and perhaps we are); his manic/schizophrenic style suits his subject matter perfectly. Clelia is never without a camera, it seems to give her an excuse to go wherever she wants and do whatever she wants, but it also seems to be what gives her a voyeur's (movie director's) sense of control over the world around her. We learn who she is by observing what catches her eye and everything catches her eye: one moment she is photographing a fellow employees' hands which she finds to be extraordinary not because they are beautiful (Clelia is not by nature attracted to traditionaly beautiful things) but because they show wear and tear; and the next moment she is in a locker room photographing a mostly nude hockey team after a victory. Her photographs, as the nasty journalist mnetioned above observes, rarely contain heads. They are just torsos, just body parts. Zulawski presents Clelia as an animal on the prowl, and as a kind of visual adrenalin junkie.  Zulawski spends considerable time exploring the degree to which our natures are defined by our pasts, the degree to which our nature's influence our personal and professional and entertainment choices, and the degree to which we can change those natures. Clelia's choice of career seems perfectly suited to one who responds so spontaneously to visual stimuli, but her choice of husband seems to be a choice based less on who she is than on who she would like to become.

Clelia's husband, on the other hand, knows exactly who he is and what he values. Cleve is attracted to Clelia's classical beauty (interestingly when they first meet there is a pane of glass between them that prevents any real communication) but not to her youthful impulsiveness and unpredictability. Cleve prefers old world things, settled things, he cannot avoid the modern world and he must make decisions that compromise the integrity of the family's highbrow reputation but he is wealthy enough to remain insulated from many of the things that he finds distasteful about the modern world. Clelia too has a distaste for the modern world but she has so far not been afforded the privilege of living in any other. Once she gets a taste of it, she finds she enjoys living in Cleve's ageless enclave but it takes her awhile to adjust.

Zulawski's films are visually distinct because characters are defined less by nameable qualities than by objects and atmospheres. And so Zulawski's world is a viscerally charged one, one where visual stimuli always contain a (transformative and/or stabilizing) spiritual force and all other forms of culture simply pale in comparison. Cleve is therefore defined by the objects on his desk and by the atmospheres, colors, and arrangement of certain rooms. Clelia is defined by her photographs and the way she relates to as well as manipulates the world through this visual medium. Zulawski's character's inhabit the world in very distinct ways. Like the director himself, they are almost all at war with the present and with conventions of every kind. And this lends his films a restless creative intensity unmatched by any other filmmakers. His characters seem only partially civilized, or, perhaps I should say, only partially colonized by the world around them; they are civilized/cultured but nature/spirituality has not been civilized out of them. They are more uniquely alive than the people around them and almost self-sustaining; their inner realities being so complete and complex, they find it hard to communicate with those around them (even when they find someone with whom they are or could be compatible).

On the surface it seems that the problem with Cleve and Clelia is that Cleve comes from a family that is used to living according to its own tastes and traditions and Cleve's family habit of mind has been not to compromise with the crass realities of the present. It would seem that this obdurate family pride is what makes it hard for Cleve to allow the much younger Clelia the time she needs to work out who she is and what she wants from life, and what makes him interpret her hesitations/indecisions/confusions as rejections. But really the main problem is that neither of them know quite how to communicate with other people. They feel a connection to each other but that connection cannot be articulated (or at least they cannot find a way to articulate it). Since neither of them can communicate (Cleve says he can appreciate books but not write them, and Clelia expresses herself only visually), neither of them can articulate what needs to be articulated. The class disconnect may be a contributing factor, but the failure to communicate is the actual cause of their tragedy.",1331942400,3,9069,4.908083441981747
8118881,3,B000F8F5JS,"Sophie plays a woman who is very cool emotionally, although smoldering with sensuality.  The plot involves her settling for a rather bland husband, then later having an affair with a rugged, dangerous co-worker.  Not nearly as unusual as her other Zulawski films, you will still benefit from a healthy appetite for foreign cinema to really enjoy this.  I recommend this really if you're a fan of Sophie or Zulawski; if you want to see Sophie's charms in more accessible (though no less french) films, try Fanfan or La Fille de D'Artangan.  Or if you don't speak french and sub-titles are not your thing, her one brilliant English-speaking role is in Firelight.",1207008000,8,660,4.918918918918919
