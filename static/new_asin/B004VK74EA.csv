4482775,5,B004VK74EA,"Like the title in my review states this was the last good year for ""McMillan and Wife"". This was the final season Mac and Sally would be together as Susan Saint James was fired at the end of the season due to a bitter contract dispute with Universal Studios over money. This would cost Universal and NBC (the network which aired the series) financially as they foolishly retooled the show as ""McMillan"" in the following year and tried to make a show without one of the leads. ""McMillan"" was subsequently cancelled after one year.

 There are 7 telefilms included in this set, but like previous releases there are no bonuses. The films themselves are presented in their original full frame ratio.

 The following is a list of season 5 episodes along with their airdates:

1. ""The Deadly Inheritence"", Sept. 28, 1975
2. ""Requiem for a Bride"", Oct. 26, 1975
3. ""Aftershock"", Nov. 9, 1075
4. ""Secrets for Sale"", Dec. 7, 1975
5. ""The Deadly Cure"", Jan. 18, 1976
6. ""Greed"", Feb. 15, 1976
7. ""Point of Law"", March 7, 1976 (Susan Saint James' last appearance)",1302566400,40,1052,4.664864864864865

4482779,5,B004VK74EA,"Again I love the whole McMillan & Wife series, and happy to have the DVD's.  I much prefer most of the series from the 1970's, 80's, and 90's.  As for movies and TV shows today, too much sex and violence has been added.",1400025600,,219,4.069767441860465

4482785,5,B004VK74EA,"I loved all the episodes... my wife is more critical, so there were only three she didn't like.
I stopped ordering here because I knew Sally had left the show and it wouldn't be as good.",1364860800,,186,4.194444444444445
4482786,3,B004VK74EA,"Compared to other tv dvds (such as Columbo) this one is not as good -- there are noticeable artifacts, The dvd was not cut from pristine original, but some later copy, and start of each dvd has introduction of the movie night series, e.g., McCloud, Columbo. Would rate lower, but the stories are pretty good especially in light of junk on tv nowadays.",1361491200,,351,4.587301587301587
4482787,5,B004VK74EA,"They simply do not make tv series like this one anymore. Yes, it's about murder but it's so tastefully done! No blood, no bodies, no autopsies--just lots of great dialogue between McMillan, Wife and Maid. Oh, and John Schuck too. I am also completely in love with the McMillan's house. It screams 1970s and makes me want to find a time machine and zoom back to the days pre-cell phone, pre-microwave and pre-personal computer. Rock Hudson plays his role with a sly glint in his eye, Susan St. James is a flaky hippie girl who is somehow living life as a conventional young matron and Nancy Walker is perfection as the wise-cracking housekeeper. I could watch this show over and over and over and I probably will!",1361491200,2,712,4.6141732283464565
4482788,5,B004VK74EA,I always loved this show and am so glad it is out on DVD. I used to enjoy the mystery series that ran once a month or so and this was one of the shows that played. I really enjoyed the actors and guest stars in the episodes too. Very glad I bought this. Thanks,1361404800,,260,3.7454545454545456
4482789,4,B004VK74EA,"What happened to the baby is left in the unknown but if that can be rationalized in one's mind, then it's a good season.",1358294400,,120,4.041666666666667
4482790,5,B004VK74EA,"""McMillan and Wife"" was one of the programs included in the original classic anthology series NBC Mystery Movie.  Along with ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"" spinning alternate weeks, audiences of the 1970s enjoyed (as the title implied) movie-length episodes of each.  ""McMillan and Wife"" was my favorite.  With its, then unique, blend of drama, comedy, crime and romance, it's a series that truly had it all and paved the way for so many series to come. Indeed, one need only peruse a few of the crime shows today (""Bones"", ""Castle"", or the ""Mentalist"" just to name a few) and one can easily see the influence of ""McMillan and Wife"".  The series lasted for six seasons ""technically"", but Susan St. James left after season five and it never recovered from the blow.  The network attempted to go for season six as a revamped ""McMillan"", with Rock Hudson going solo, but with a show in which the chemistry and indeed even the original title hinged on the ""Wife"", the spark was gone.  The first five seasons however remain as one of the best series of the 1970s, and with an influence that reverberates to this day, I very HIGHLY recommend these DVD collections to any TV fan.",1353196800,3,1165,4.714285714285714
4482791,5,B004VK74EA,"The script is just awesome! Rock and susan made a great couple on tele, action a plenty. The scenery of San Francisco is just breathtaking, even better now (2012).",1347753600,,163,4.655172413793103
4482792,5,B004VK74EA,"A part of NBC's revolving Sunday Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife was perhaps second in popularity to Columbo during its six season run.  Although stars Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James reportedly did not have the warmest personal relationship, onscreen they were the idyllic crime solving couple, beloved by many.  The fifth season would be the last for the lovely Ms. Saint James, and also for Nancy Walker, but thanks to some stellar writing, it was one of the series' best.

In 1975-76, the Mystery Movie occupied a two hour time slot, with each episode running about 95 minutes.  With ample time to fill, and with Steve Bochco serving as executive story consultant, the mysteries were well-developed, complicated, usually contained a few red herrings, and often a surprise or twist ending, as San Francisco's police commissioner Stuart McMillan (Hudson), his wife Sally (Saint James), and housekeeper Mildred (Walker), get involved in seven more intriguing and very entertaining adventures.  Kind of a slow burn, the journey may be long and involved, but the payoff is almost always worth your time.

The overall quality of the episodes is quite good, and one of the best is ""Aftershock"", where during an earthquake a brick wall in the McMillan's residence cracks open to reveal a human skeleton.  Plans to sell the house are put on hold, as Mac looks into who the dead man might be.  Richard Dawson is marvelous as a Lloyds of London investigator on the trail of some missing jewels.

In ""Greed"", after Mildred's aunt dies under mysterious circumstances, Mildred's sister Agatha (Martha Raye), and her niece Jenny (Lane Bradbury), arrive in town for the reading of her will.  Jenny inherits a small fortune, but is soon found murdered.  Of course Mac and Sally get involved in the case, but Agatha also decides to play detective.  Martha Raye is absolutely fabulous as the nosy Agatha.  In season six, when Nancy Walker departed to star in her own series, Raye would return as Agatha, replacing Mildred as the housekeeper.

At a time when various politicians are being blackmailed, Sergeant Enright (John Schuck) resigns from the department to take a position at a private security agency, in ""Secrets For Sale"".  Meanwhile Sally has her suspicions regarding Enright's gorgeous new girlfriend (Meredith Baxter), and things get more dangerous, as Mac gets closer to the truth.

In season five, the relationship between Sally and Mac remains solid, and the romance is still present, although it seldom blazes as it did in previous seasons.  The couple's affection for their sometimes cranky, but normally lovable housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker), also continues.  With the departure of Saint James and Walker, the fifth season of McMillan and Wife is truly the end of an era.  In season six, Enright would be promoted, and no longer work side by side with the commissioner, and although the show continued as ""McMillan"", vital parts of its soul were missing.

If you are a fan of the series or a lover of detective mysteries, this season is highly recommended, with seven episodes on four discs.  Unfortunately, typical for this fine series, the episodes are not subtitled, and there are no bonus materials.  There has been a price drop, so it could be a good opportunity.",1338163200,9,3286,5.012891344383057

4482795,5,B004VK74EA,"I'm so glad to see the release of seasons 3, season 4 and season 5 of McMillan and Wife.  I was too young to recognize good television when the show initially aired. I later became a fan of the show in syndication. I hope they release Season 6 as well. I agree the show lost a little pizzazz when St. James left but Season 6 has at least one fantastic episode, ""Dark Sunrise"".....superb writing. Rock Hudson fit this role like a glove. Yeah, St. James was good too during the earlier seasons but usually when a show is on it's last legs the writing suffers. However, ""Dark Sunrise"" was an excellent episode. I already have Seasons 1 & 2 and am looking forward to this summer when I can watch 3 more seasons!!! Hopefully 4!! (Hint Hint) Hooray!!!!",1303948800,7,746,4.405797101449275
