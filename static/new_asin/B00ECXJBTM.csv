5904122,5,B00ECXJBTM,I have a lot of JFK Books and DVDs but this sounded like the same material but told through a different lens and I was very pleased as that is exactly what this collection is-it had different pictures and interviews that I had never seen and while the last disc (three shots that changed the world)was one I have and was familiar with the first two discs were new and fun to watch for a JFK  buff that I am and for the price (got mine at Sam's club but Amazon I'm sure will match) I am very happy to add this to my collection and anyone into JFK or just some one that wants one DVD collection about him and his life-this would be a very good choice!!! Good job to the History Chanel-they are the best and one of my favorite channels to watch!!!,1383350400,31,744,4.095890410958904

5904138,5,B00ECXJBTM,"This a great collection for JFK buffs. It includes some footage you probably have seen before, but there are other parts of it that were certainly new to me. It's a collection about Kennedy family, not just JFK, and it includes eight films on three discs: JFK: A Personal Story, Parts I and II; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; John F. Kennedy Jr.: The Death of an American Prince; Joseph Kennedy Sr.: Father of an American Dynasty; Robert F. Kennedy: His Many Sides; Ted Kennedy: Tragedy, Scandal and Redemption; and JFK: Three Shots That Changed America. I liked them all, but enjoyed Three Shots, which took up the whole third disc, the best.

This collection was released in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the assassination, but it makes good viewing anytime.",1407283200,19,768,4.907692307692308

5904142,5,B00ECXJBTM,"Well what can one say on the SAD subject of JFK ? I have about everything you could view on the subject including the movie JFK which did not make much sense at the time as there was so much happening. I watched  it again on TV for JFK's 50th anniversary even though I had the DVD at this time I understood much better what they were trying to do with this movie. This DVD is just one of many available on the subject JFK. I feel nothing but SADNESS for this man who it appears now most definitely was killed by his own. What happened to you America ? There was a change after WW2 from not wanting to war to a Country who will go to war just for the sake of it as they think the Military Arm makes money not to forget power. Who is really running your country North America. Is it the White House OR ??? Why do not the people there rise up? I can tell you there is so much poverty, disillusionment and drug addiction. A FREE LAND MY ARSE. Yes compared to the Middle East and some others INDEED YES FREE TO AN EXTENT. The Newspapers thanks to Murdock will write what ever he wants to sway a vote!!!!! Well the digital age will now take over and already has!! What happened was Watergate NIXON. He brought in your incredible cruel Health system!!!! Well an Insurance Company will try their best to not pay out !!!! It is filmed JFK was going down the road of not mobilising ground troops in Vietnam it is on film. He inherited the ""Bay of Pigs"" from Ike. He felt for the black community and their rights and he was moving down the path of conciliation. BUT NO the prejudiced ignorant White Man could not have that !!!!!!! American you lost a great President the first born in the 20th Century and one who had a CONSCIENCE and minded for others CARE. I feel sorry for my American Brothers and Sisters as we are all joined as Western Cultures and must support each other this is natural but not for the reason to just be in a constant War. Blair and Howard did the right thing by going into Iraq but why Iraq? Were they not more interested in where was ASAMA one man and in Jesus's name how many of your youth have you killed you old men of the Military????!!!!!!!!How do you sleep at night ? Roosevelt was a great man and a caring man who did not want to enter the war but knew he would have to eventually as Hitler had his sites set on the US too ? Then there was Pearl Harbour and America mobilized this brought jobs and money to the country and since then any President not thinking of war watch out. YES I WAS so sad when I saw the footage of JFK, I was 8 when it happened, we all sat in front of our TV on the other side of the world and we were all WEEPIN WITH SORROW AND LOSS for a man we only knew as the President Kennedy of the USA. Why are humans so cruel ? The truth will come out and has already. Although JFK's file will be sealed until there is no one alive who will remember him andhe will become a sad part of the American History. I suggest you buy as many DVD's on this subject as you can and I am referring to documentaries. GOD BLESS JFK AND RFK. There was no way the Establishment was going to allow them to rule and thank god Ted Kennedy did not run for President as he would have definitely have met the same fate as his siblings. For you who did these awful things THOSE WHO ORGANISED THE ASSASINATIONS BY killing them, JFK AND RFK YOU HAVE MADE THEM IMMORTAL, UNFORGETTABLE FOR ALL OF TIME.",1386547200,13,3413,4.109281437125748
