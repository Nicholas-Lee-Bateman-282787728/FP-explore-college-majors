8066275,4,B0009SCUU6,"""Piano"" brings me back to when I was a young girl, and my inner emotional landscape at that delicate age. In the quiet of the series, ""ordinary"" moments can be exquisitely felt through Miu, and for me, the ability of the artists to evoke those feelings is the unique charm of ""Piano."" It's drawn very well, and that piano score is fragile and lovely. It's not big on plot, but it's emotionally rich for those with the eyes to see and the ears to hear that richness.

""Piano"" transcends its genre, imo. It's more than anime. It has a heart.",1235088000,,539,4.39
8066276,2,B0009SCUU6,"okay before I continue this review let me first say that I am not one of those ever-annoying people who need explosions and fan service to be amazed by an anime....heck some of the best anime ever created are slow paced ( lain, haibane renmei,evangelion,ect) but this is beyond ridicoulous....This anime wasn't refreshing or different to me, but rather so unforgivably boring I actually would rather watch 5 hours of baby einstein with my 11 month old brother than 30 minutes of this..

still don't believe me? fine, allow me to sum up the entire first episode

girl is in school

girl is supposed to go to piano class

girl's freind convinces her to skip out and go to cd store

girl goes to cd store

girl feels guilty and goes to piano class

girl's piano teacher is not happy

girl leaves

girl goes to train station

girl realizes she forgot her umbrella

girl is sad

girl walks around in a daze for 3 minutes

girl runs into father

girl is happy

girl goes home with father

the end

did that sound interesting to you? nah me neither

for better anime that doesnt constantly contain explosions and fan service try

fruits basket

princess mononoke

wolfs rain

gunslinger girl (dont let the title fool you....this is no action show)

neon genesis evangelion

haibane renmei

serial experiments lain

castle in the sky (and everything else from miyazaki-san)

paranoia agent

all the above titles are just a fraction of anime awesomness...oh and in case you all are wondering, I gave this two stars because the animation is slightly above average....but good animation does not mean a good anime",1131667200,,1602,4.7272727272727275
8066277,4,B0009SCUU6,"Miu is a young girl who has the talent to play the piano, her teacher Shirakawa to enter her in a recital, were she will play an emotional self-written piece. This is a story about first love and friendship and challenges one must overcome to succeed.",1127174400,,251,4.478260869565218
8066278,4,B0009SCUU6,"Piano is a bit different from most anime.  It's only 10 episodes to begin with.  There is no magic, no fighting, no weapons.  There are no chibi/super-deformed moments, wacky rainbow backgrounds with big letters, it's not a love comedy by any means. So what does Piano have?

Piano is the story of a girl, Miu, who found an interest in the piano at a young age, but over the years her interest in it is wavering, no thanks to her stoic piano teacher.  Her father and mother are normal parents, her sister is a tour guide, and her she owns a regular black cat.  Her best friend is on the track team, along with the boy that Miu likes.

Miu faces difficulties finding her inspiration and the courage to confess to the boy she likes, and this is the overall theme across the 10 episodes.  The main interest in Piano is that it's a relaxing experience, since it's not extreme in any way even with the mild sense of drama, though it is very well drawn IMHO.

Piano will be released as three DVDs for the 10 episodes.  I enjoyed seeing this in Japanese, but like I said, there's nothing extraordinary or exciting about it, so while it is pleasing, it's only worth 4 stars to me.",1124755200,5,1172,4.359447004608295
