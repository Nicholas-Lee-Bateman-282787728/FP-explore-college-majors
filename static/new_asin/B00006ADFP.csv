1735893,4,B00006ADFP,"It's initially somewhat disconcerting to watch this movie, shot as a video rather than in traditional film format. But the script and the performances are so affecting and so honest that it quickly becomes entirely engrossing. A motley-seeming collection of average people: a raging restaurant keeper with a hidden talent for language, an accommodating hairdresser with a nightmare of a mother who just happens to be terminally ill, a klutzy, good-natured young bakery worker with a horrible father, a disaffected management type and a charming Italian waitress. They all find themselves at an evening class in Italian and they manage to make connections--with themselves and with the others in the class--in humorous and bittersweet ways.
This is a very worthwhile film. Don't be put off by the oddness of the video. You'll forget about it soon enough and become entirely caught up in this wonderfully well-acted, truly touching and amusing film.
Highly recommended.",1041811200,49,967,5.326797385620915
1735894,3,B00006ADFP,"ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS is a low budget production that perhaps didn't cost much more than the index cards with the ending credits scribbled on them. It was apparently shot largely with a hand-held camera, and reminded me of a home movie, albeit one of better image quality.
In this film, the audience follows the daily lives of six lonely singles. Olympia is a bakery employee with low self-esteem whose parents die within a short time of each other. Hal-Finn is a testy restaurant manager fired for verbally abusing customers. Giulia, an Italian immigrant speaking little Danish who dreams of finding Mr. Wonderful, is a waitress at Hal-Finn's restaurant. Jorgen is a sexually impotent hotel clerk, who's afraid he'll never again be able to have an intimate relationship with a woman. Jorgen confides in Andreas, the temporary pastor at the local church, who's finding it difficult being accepted by the congregation. Finally, Karen the hairdresser loyally visits her hospitalized mother, who soon dies.
During that part of the plot shot in Denmark, we see very little of the outdoors. We don't even know the name of the city or town. Almost all the ""action"" occurs indoors, and eventually is focused in a community adult education class, ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS, to which all of the characters have gravitated (for reasons beyond me). Very soon, the instructor is physically incapacitated and disappears from the storyline. Already knowing more Italian than the others, Hal-Finn takes over the teaching role. In the meantime, attraction between individuals is germinating.
This film is not without charm, but most of that occurs in the last 20 minutes or so (of the 112 minute run time) when the location switches to Venice, Italy. Otherwise, it's as if you yourself took a video cam, followed some unmarried buds around with it for a couple of weeks, and then sold the tape to a major studio. It's not a bad or unenjoyable picture, but I'm just amazed that it was made for the Big Screen. All of the characters inspire good feelings, even the prickly Hal-Finn. Indeed, Giulia is pretty darn cute. And there's an unexpected twist involving Olympia and Karen that would make anyone's day interesting. (""Honey, guess who's coming for dinner."")",1040428800,4,2240,5.024193548387097
1735895,1,B00006ADFP,"Back in the early `90s, when I was tooling about making home movies as a lark, and NEVER taking any of it seriously, I had NO idea that I had actually stumbled upon a method of filmmaking that very soon would be touted as THE method of the true, bona fide ""auteur"" (or, more accurately according to the tenets of the ""method"" used in this film, the ""ANTI-auteur""), and that one day I would be watching ""Italian for Beginners,"" directed by (well, credit for the directing cannot be given, as it would be against the ""rules,"" which I will get to in a moment) and filmed in much the same-- in fact, the EXACT same-- style that I had employed back in what I now know were MY ""auteur"" (excuse me; my ""ANTI-auteur"") days.  But having watched this film, the evidence is irrefutable; I know, because I've just finished watching the movies I shot back then with my trusty camcorder to get a comparison.  And all I can say now is:  ""STAND ASIDE AND GIVE ME ROOM-- I'M ON MY WAY TO SUNDANCE!""
In 1995, Danish filmmakers Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg developed a new (?) filmmaking technique, for which they co-wrote a back-to-basics guide entitled ""Dogma 95,"" a manifesto for filmmakers who, by adhering to the rules set forth in the text, would become a part of the ""newest"" new wave to hit the industry, subsequently referred to as the ""Cinema of Poverty,"" and with good reason.
If you're thinking of giving this film a go, before you watch it you MUST know something about Dogma 95 to have a chance in the hot place of making it through to the end.  There are ten ""rules"" set forth in the manifesto, as well as an addendum, a handful of items tacked on (afterthoughts?), such as ""I am no longer an artist"" (which after watching this film I fully understand and agree with).  But the main things (rules) you must know going in are these:  The movie must be filmed on location, with only a hand-held camera and using only whatever light is naturally available.  And ""music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.""  (Somewhat contradictorily, two of Von Trier's subsequent films were musicals; his disclaimer:  ""The rules are not meant to `limit' creativity, but to `spur it on').  Rule #10 states:  ""The director must not be credited.""  In retrospect, the wisdom of THIS rule is beyond reproach.
There IS some substance to this story, imbued as it is with elements of classic Bergman as it examines ""loss"" on a number of levels through the lives of a small, diverse group of individuals in various stages of disenfranchisement.  Their common denominator is the class in, well...Italian for beginners, to which they seemingly gravitate, each with their own specific reasons and motivations.  The class becomes a kind of focal point for them; it is here that relationships are formed or honed, and their lives begin to intersect.  Now, had only Bergman been on hand to direct them.
These are everyday folks, just going about the business of living; and quite frankly, they aren't all that interesting, nor are their respective stories.  The group includes Hal-Finn (Lars Kaalund), an obnoxious restaurant employee who hasn't as yet caught on to the ""customer/employee"" dynamic-- he's self-absorbed, rude and insufferable; Jorgen (Peter Gantzler) lacks self confidence; Karen (Ann Eleonora Jorgensen) a hairdresser who never seems to be able to finish a client (Hal-Finn is in her chair at least three times, but never gets past the hair-wetting phase before some crisis or other calls Karen away, sending poor Hal-Finn away each time with a wet head and no haircut); Olympia (Anette Stovelbaek) who works in a bakery, where no doubt she sells danish (pun intended; I have nothing to lose at this point); and Andreas (Anders W. Berthelsen), a pastor who has taken a temporary assignment six months after the death of his wife.  But listening to the thoughts (and I intentionally do not use the term ""ideas"" here) of a randomly selected group of postal employees on the dock at 3 a.m. at the post office would be intrinsically more interesting than anything that occurs in this film.  Berthelsen, especially, spends the entire movie looking confused, like he's a contestant on Jeopardy! but can't figure out why Alex keeps giving him the answers instead of the questions.  Or maybe he's just trying to understand what he's doing in this film to begin with.  Where, oh where, is Ingmar when you need him?
On a positive note, the performances here are for the most part quite natural, if not engaging.  Kaalund, at least, makes a lasting impression with a character reminiscent of Rutger Hauer's Eric Vonk in ""Turkish Delight"" (aka ""Turk's Fruit""), from 1973; perhaps that's why Hal-Finn is always getting in ""Dutch"" with his boss (again, pun intended).
The supporting cast includes Sara Indrio Jensen (Giulia), Jesper Christensen (Olympia's Father), Lene Tiemroth (Karen's Mother) and Carlo Barsotti (Marcello).  There are those who are going to like, even applaud, this film; personally, I'd rather watch paint dry.  To connect with this film one has to be able to embrace, or at least get beyond, the whole Dogma 95 thing.  I couldn't.  Okay, perhaps I just don't ""get"" it; to this day I still don't get the Andy Warhol ""soup can"" deal, either.  Just know that ""Italian for Beginners"" is definitely NOT going to be for everyone.  I do find it interesting that the ""rules"" are also referred to as the filmmakers ""Vows of chastity,"" and that in reviews of Dogma 95 films the terms ""chaste,"" ""austere"" and ""pure"" always seem to surface.  In the great scheme of things I know it means something; what it is, I don't know.  But bear in mind that the manifesto also states, ""Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste!""  And with that, I rest my case.",1039219200,17,5786,4.768537074148297
1735896,4,B00006ADFP,"Your first impression of this movie will be ""OMG, they filmed this with a home movie camera!"", which I believe they did.  You get over it fast enough though because the script and characters really are able to draw you in.  Perhaps this 'home-movie' feel was done on purpose (or mabey all Dutch films ar so low-budget) because it makes the entire movie seem so much more viceral and real; you'll feel almost voyeuristic watching it.  The story centers around seven (ending up with nine) people who take an Italian class together, and all the drama and humor that follow them.  I found this film uproriously funny, not so much at the script, but at the film making (the way they show the final credits is priceless).  The script is, however, quite well done.  The humor is very believeable, but not the kind that makes you cringe like so many American films do (""rushmore"" is a perfect example of cringe-humor).
It only got four stars from me because it lacked much new insight into relationships.  The characters all found eachother it the same traditional way that most characters in romances do.  However, it does well to avoid the annoying and somewhat unrealistic dramas that Julia Roberts seems plagued with.  Their pain seem much more plausable, and for that I'm thankful.",1038614400,8,1278,4.7727272727272725
1735897,5,B00006ADFP,"then this movie is not to be missed.  Real people, ordinary people, are much more interesting than the so-called beautiful people.  And how they interact in the ordinary moments in life and how they fall in love can be wonderful to watch.  Contrary to what I read from another review a moment ago, I think this movie is extraordinarily uplifting!  If you're a sentimental old fool like I am, you'll probably get a tear as the movie ends with the song ""Don't you know?"" playing in the background, as did I.  What a lovely movie!!!!

1735898,4,B00006ADFP,"This is a sweet, touching, comedic film...not what I would consider a comedy, but it does have many funny moments.
ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS is the name of the foreign language class which is the thread that holds together the six somewhat lonely and wounded characters in this movie. Each one is trying to deal, with some modicum of dignity, with his or her life and the disappointments and troubles they encounter.
The movie deals with the characters' everyday conflicts and challenges - with little distraction for the audience (no sound track, minimal scenery, etc)except for the jerking of the hand-held camera. Gradually, unknown and unsuspected connections between the characters are cleverly revealed, as are the many layers of this story. I thought that the character development was very well done. Seeing how these people connect is heartwarming and leaves the viewer feeling as hopeful as the characters do.",1038182400,7,915,5.1891891891891895
1735899,5,B00006ADFP,"ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS is a unique little film.  Like many of the better known Nordic films, this tale of disparate ordinary people who all have lost some of the joy of life, whether that be in the form of th loss of a family member or a job or a sense of self worth, has an edgy side that only demonstrates how close the masks of tragedy and comedy hang.  Claustrophobic as Denmark in the winter, the setting and camera work enhance the passing needs we all feel when we are at our most vulnerable. The unifying element (or the modus exodus) for these likeable characters comes in their commonly attended Italian for Beginners class. The interaction between the characters is sweet, warming and gently humorous for all the background reality of making it through life.  An excellent cast enhances this charming and moving story, one that should find a warm spot in everyone's heart.  Highly recommended.",1036195200,8,903,4.732484076433121
1735900,5,B00006ADFP,"From Denmark comes ""Italian for Beginners"", one of the sweetest, wisest and most enjoyable romantic comedy-dramas I have seen in a long time. Intellectually, it is closer to a dessert than a main course, but all desserts are not equal. You'll fondly remember this one. Like most romantic movies, its plot is rather farfetched. Its characters, though, are down to earth and believable - ordinary people trying to make their way through life's ups and downs with a little dignity.
In a small Danish city, six people find their lives in disarray for various reasons - two are caring for aged, ungrateful parents, one has recently lost his wife, another is about to lose his job, etc. They are not so much hopeless as they are desperate for hope. Their lives intersect in unexpected ways in an unlikely setting - a course in Italian at a local school.
Compared to its American counterparts, ""Italian for Beginners"" a small, sparse movie. Some viewers may not relate to the characters because none of them are larger than life. For me, their very ordinariness provides much of the movie's charm, because it makes their falling in love all the more special.
The film is in Danish and Italian with English subtitles.

1735952,4,B00006ADFP,"To those who know nothing about ""Dogme 95"", it is a cinema movement, set by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, that was an attempt to encourage filmmakers to get rid of the most artificial aspects of film-making (ex: special effects, lighting effects) and create instead more naturalistic and story-driven movies.
Therefore came the use of hand-held cameras, natural lighting, diegetic music (heard on location), and movies occurring in our time period. Like ""the Idiots"", whom I loved and which Charlotte Gainsbourg said it was her favorite Trier film, and Festen, which I didn't get to see yet.
Along those movies came another one that had intrigued me. A romantic comedy called Italian for Beginners, which some Amazon Uk Buyers have confused for a Language learning movie due to the inter-title on the British DVD cover. A movie that I heard Lars von trier wasn't too happy with as the ending was not open-ended and that the movie, even under an avant-grade current, seemed more like a classical romantic story. Still, the director, Lone Scherfig, said that she would do the film to her own sensibility, releasing it in 2000 under great reviews and numerous prizes in Berlin and around the world.

The story, set in a Danish town, involves nine people and their personal issues as some, though all eventually, participate in an Italian class that takes a wrong turn as the teacher dies from a sudden heart attack. Therefore the plot tries to deal with grief, death, and loneliness, but through a positive energy; with wonderful actors whose performances are perfect as the story, which might have been banal and redundant under classical film-making, is shot in a realistic style. Unlike Lars von Trier's work, Scherfig employed a more stable camerawork, more subtle editing with not much jump cuts, and her movie takes place in other locations like Italy as Love engulfs the characters and creates strong ties between them.

I had seen that movie back in 2009 and had liked it. Not the masterpiece of the year, but I felt it was a good attempt to enrich the Dogme 95 Wave with another perspective. I even rewatched it  recently and liked it. Though I still think what I thought back then; that if this movie had been done with classical camerawork, I would not have gone and seen it, thinking it as derivative and formulaic as other movies in that genre. A detail I believe is maybe why Lars, who thrives for evolving storytelling, had reticences about Scherfig's movie.
But then came another detail I learned yesterday. One that has really stained this movie and my perception of it.
Indeed, I found out on IMdB that Lone Sherfig had borrowed many plot elements for her film from ""Evening Class"", a novel written by Maeve Binchy, an author whose books and name I didn't know until yesterday. Wanting to be sure of this revelation's veracity, I searched on the Web and found two 2010 Danish articles (read through Google Translate), and two Wikipedia articles that confirmed the sad truth. That Lone had borrowed several elements from that novel, which she had stated to Peter Aalbaek Jensen, Zentropa's CEO whose love for the media spotlight and controversial business personality makes him, as Peter stated in the Tranceformer documentary, Lars von Trier's polar opposite. From what Jensen explained in the two articles I read, he had contacted a lawyer specialised in copyright and asked him if there were any copyright issues with Scherfig's script and the lawyer had told him that no, there weren't. That is until Binchy's agent contacted Zentropa and sent concerns over the film's plot similarities with the novel. Which made Zentropa's CEO realize, anyway that's what I think and hope, that the lawyer he had used didn't do his job. While to me, it makes me realize that Lone Scherfig's movie's more of an adaptation than an original story.
As to the whole story's resolution, I know the matter was solved peacefully and with professionalism between lawyers, that an undisclosed money deal was made and that a special thanks credits has been added, with Maeve Binchy's name, to future editions of ""Italian for Beginners"". But I still have questions as to how much of the novel Lone Scherfig appropriated herself with. Of Binchy's novels, which I won't read because it's not my cup of tea, I have only
consulted ""Evening Class""'s back cover on the author's website and with what I read also on Wikipedia (italian lesson, italian trip), I too found similarity issues. So if anybody could pinpoint out how much the movie borrowed from the novel, then it would be interesting for us to know.

But still.... still...

It's the kind of copyright matter that I think should have been dealt with the novel's author before the movie's production. Because this whole story leaves me with a sour taste that stains ""Italian for Beginners"" the same way ""The Lion King/Kimba the White Lion"" controversy hurt my perspective of Walt Disney's animated movies. Because I seriously think Zentropa's CEO, the lawyer he employed, Scherfig, and Ib Tardini, who's the movie producer, should have done better their work.",1425600000,,5111,4.924593967517401

The characters are all likable and all have their quirks. There are no secrets here, just ""unknowns"" that naturally exist between strangers/acquaintances. We learn about the characters as they reveal themselves to each other. It is difficult to say which character I liked the most, for all are handled sympathetically, leaving you feeling that most people deserve tenderness once you are privileged to learn their story. Human beings are fragile creatures, and only the severely wounded will turn their back on companionship and the opportunity to love.  There are no nude scenes, no violence, no foul language.

1735958,4,B00006ADFP,"Here is a charming R-rated Danish film from the year 2000; ""Italiensk for begyndere"" (English captions). This film was honored by film festivals all over Europe and the United States. It has adult themes, e.g., impotence, fetal alcohol syndrome, and aging or abusive parents, yet I just finished watching my DVD again (from Amazon) with a huge smile on my face.

We are in a Danish town where we meet our small cast of characters. They include:
  * A recently widowed pastor, whose wife had suffered from schizophrenia. He becomes the acting pastor at a local church because the elderly minister has been alienating his parishioners.
  * A hotel clerk who provides the minister with temporary quarters. Our shy clerk has a massive crush on a lovely young Italian woman who works in the hotel kitchen.
  * A blunt young man whose bad-tempered attacks on dining room patrons jeopardizes his job in the hotel restaurant.
  * A loyal young woman who quits the hotel kitchen when her cranky friend is fired.
  * A clumsy young woman who works in a bakery; her hateful father is housebound, demanding and verbally abusive.
  * A young hairdresser who cares for her terminally ill mother while running her own modest salon.

A small class in Conversational Italian forms at an adult education center; for one reason or another, all of our cast shows up. We get to watch their progress and see their reward.

1735959,2,B00006ADFP,"Yes, it was filmed with a very low budget (under $500) video camera.  I didn't mind much expect the person filming couldn't even keep the people upright when they were standing! The space was so limited in one of the character's business that she was always shown at a 45 degree angle.  Likewise, the places where the characters were shot were obviously extremely inexpensive or free.  Usually, if the storyline is good, I can overlook its low budget.

However, the film was a bit depressing, most are facing their midlife crisis, while you have to give the characters credit for trying something new to change their life.  The pace of the story was really slow.  I thought that I had seen it before after nearly an hour of watching, I realized I was as unimpressed this time as the first I'd seen it.  At that point, I stopped watching as I remember thinking the first time around, it is going to improve but I felt that it didn't justify anymore of my time so I quit.

The characters all have hardships particularly with two women dealing with abusive aging parents that was way to real for me and I found distracting.  This was what tipped me from ""it was okay"" to ""stick a fork in me, I'm done"".  I liked that these were all ordinary individuals, who wanted to work for a better situation.

There were a few funny scenes and if you don't mind a slower pace and reading a translation that doesn't always seem to capture the essence of what was said.  I enjoyed the dialogue in the restaurant but it was unrealistic. Then, it might be enjoyable to you.

After watching for awhile, I decided to do some research to find out where this movie came from and what it was all about, etc...I had assumed it was German or Dutch, though when I heard the character name ""Pernille"" I remembered that I have a Danish friend named Pernille...that should have been my first tip off...and then the other Scandinavian names, and the fact that they kept saying ""Tak"" when they said Thank you...but as I have traveled through some Scandinavian and Germanic countries, they often have some cross-over...ultimately, though, that is partly why I decided I had to look it up.

I am so glad I did. I had no previous knowledge of Dogme95 or any of that...How fascinating!  I feel like I have been handed an education at only the small cost of a few hours of my day which were quite enjoyable (the movie plus research time).

Sure, some parts of the movie seem implausible, but some are SO plausible it hurts a little in that uncomfortable real-to-life way.  And that is a good thing.

Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Highly recommend it.",1296086400,,1635,4.523809523809524
1735976,5,B00006ADFP,"Initially put off by the incredibly amateurish camerawork, I soon warmed to this delightfully quirky movie. The story takes place mostly in Denmark, where a collection of troubled characters find their lives intertwined when they all sign up to take an Italian class in the hope of adding a little spice to their otherwise bleak existences.

The movie initially felt a bit like black comedy, but as the pieces began to fall together, it was impossible not to get involved in the story and feel some compassion for the characters. I found myself rooting for them in spite of, or perhaps because of, their eccentricities. A feel-good movie with an understated but hopeful ending.",1256256000,,677,4.93859649122807

Directing feels as if someone was making a home-made movie, rather than a film.  But if you can get over that, and just keep watching the movie, you will find it to be delightful.  It is a story about people in a small Danish town.  They are all lonely and enduring loss of people close to them (parents, spouses, etc.).  In spite of the fact that the relationships of our main characters with the people they are loosing is far from perfect, they genuinely miss the people they have lost and grieve deeply.  As life goes on, so does their desire to redefine themselves and find a new purpose.  They start taking italian language classes at the local community center.  It is the weekly classes and the comeraderie that helps them create their own sort of support group.  All characters are well defined and their personal story is touching.  What I found a little annoying about the film is the fact that by making the characters not too smart is somehow comedic.  The story is great and i would recommend anyone to watch this film.  It will give one totally new perspective on grief, life, love, loneliness and coping.",1226275200,,1268,4.557522123893805

I didn't really read up on it (like i should have) but figured it would be good for something. It sadly really wasn't. The back of the case (description) claims this movie to be a ""heart-warming romantic comedy"" and i didn't think it was either of those things. And i know romance or comedy or romantic comedy when i see it - and i just didn't think it excelled in either. I hate to be so negative on a movie (not film, mind you - the ""Dogma 95, shot-on-8mm"" is actually kinda lame) but i was disappointed. As another reviewer said ""I miss REAL cinematography"". The acting was nothing special, and i actually didn't really get into the characters at all - the restaurant owner/second Italian teacher guy was really annoying and a jerk, but i liked the relationship between the Italian girl and Jorgenson(?) - it reminded me of the Portuguese girl's story in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (which is a much better film). Also, if one has read the description, they are led to believe that most of the movie (or at least the parts where they ""discover passion and love"") takes place in Italy, when they are actually only in Italy for about 10 minutes at the end. Sadly, i found i laughed only once, and found nothing passionate, sexy or comedic for the most part.

1736001,5,B00006ADFP,"Given the low-budget ethos of this film, it succeeds in being interesting and deep, in terms of social relationships and social issues. Rather than the heavy musical cues and editing that guide us through a Hollywood movie, this film takes us gently and realistically into the lives of 6 people who try to work out their problems by interacting with others, some of whom just happen to be in the local council Italian class.

We get a realistic view of Dutch society in this film, along with the problems that people in that society encounter. This sort of everyday cultural information does not appear in the usual cinema event. As the problems develop into temporary solutions, we get close to the characters, and identify them as normal people, looking for understanding and companionship.

The Italian lessons are a link rather than a major part of the film. They are the almost accidental meeting point of the characters, and lead to the visit to Vienna which occurs at the end. In this setting, solutions appear, and we leave the characters in peace.

As with many comedies, this film has a deeper social message about the lives and conditions of the participants. It's nice to join them in an investigation of the human condition that is not dictated by heavyweight stars and huge, commercially-financed budgets.",1167782400,6,1319,4.9058295964125564
1736002,4,B00006ADFP,"I was lukewarm towards this movie in Movie Festival few years back because it's a Danish movie (Danish and Italians are simply mutually exclusive, in my humble opinion) and secondly, it's a Dogme movie: the kind of projects that are stripped to the bare essentials and the movies are to be seen on their artistic merits and not because of ""noises"" such as SFX, sound, clever editing and so forth.  Therefore, excellence was emphasised upon the talent and courage of the actors and actresses.  At times, art movies were not cohesive and that they were there to shock, to challenge, to conjure an experience for the viewers.  After much consideration, I flagged it until few days ago, when I decided to give it a chance.  It's quite surreal to see a movie that's made using cam-cameras and that it felt documentary-ish.  Somehow, it pulled off neatly.  The movie started in fractures: a clumsy baker who tended to an abusive father, a lonely hairdresser that got bothered by her alcoholic mother, a new priest who started a congregation whose wife had just died (of horrible circumstance), a restaurant owner that had a chip on his shoulder, a dull but good-natured hotel manager that was looking for his elusive other half, and Guiliana (the Italian girl).  Whilst their lives were less than fulfilled, they found solace and comfort in their Italian class.  As it progressed, they also found friendship, strength and encouragement from that tight-knit group.  Guiliana, the Italian girl seemed to be a metaphor to have all those characters intertwined and the finale ended appropriately at Italy, at the doorsteps of Venice as they ridded of their demons.  Yes, I got a huge grin on my face with a huge sigh of satisfaction.  It's really that good.  It's been long time coming to have a movie that unfolded slowly and yet, so effective.  There's a short story in the extras, references (CV)of the main actors and actresses, and other standard technical stuff.  For those that could understand Danish language, there were additional extras for you!  An experience of a lifetime!  Buon Appetito",1144108800,6,2091,4.914529914529915

1736004,5,B00006ADFP,"I usually watch a lot of foreign films, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time I have experienced a Danish production. The first thing that surprised me was that the movie was created using handheld cameras and natural light, but it took me not time at all to get used to it, and the excellent story, together with the inspired acting, enthralled me until the ending titles.

Andreas (Berthelsen) is a pastor that arrives at a small Danish town to replace an old a stubborn colleague that has been suspended from his chores. Andreas lost his wife a short while ago, and is having a difficult time coping with this; now he is trying to get used to this new life and reconstruct what was shattered in the recent past. In this small town he meets a fascinating set of characters, all of them with personal problems, dreams and fears, and the relationship among all these people is what makes this one of the best movies in the last few years.

Finn (Kaalund) is the manager of the restaurant located in the soccer stadium of the town, and he has a ""small"" attitude problem that usually ends up with the customers being mistreated and expelled from the establishment. That is why Jorgen (Gantzler), Finn's best friend, is forced by management to fire him, which is no easy task. Besides the three men, the cast incorporates Karen (Jorgensen), a hairdresser with an alcoholic mother, Olympia, a clumsy woman who works at a bakery, and Giulia, a beautiful waitress that only speaks Italian.

All these characters converge, lead by different reasons, in an Italian class. In that place, they can be themselves and as each one of them starts coming out of their shell they learn the value of those things that are important in life. One of the main strengths of this film has to do precisely with how it spends considerable time showing us the feelings each character experiences and the interaction among these people, through precise and insightful dialogues.

This is one of those movies that prove that you do not need a huge budget to produce a film of excellent quality. What you do need is a great script, with actors that understand what they are supposed to do; the rest comes naturally. I am very happy to recommend this movie, and I am already trying to find more Danish films so I can verify if they follow the same pattern as this one in terms of excellence.",1119484800,5,2374,4.6052009456264775
1736005,5,B00006ADFP,"This movie is not as lighthearted as the picture on the cover of the DVD/VHS attempts to portray. This film was shot like a home movie, using only a handheld video camera with natural lighting. The plot focuses on 6 individuals (3 men, 3 women) whose lives intertwine through a weekly night Italian language class. It is a comedy in the sense that the 3 men and 3 women eventually end up paired with each other, but the movie begins with the life challenges of each of the main characters. We are introduced to the compassionate YOUNG PASTOR, whose schizophrenic wife had recently died. This young pastor applies for a job at a church whose permanent pastor is suffering from the loss of his own wife three years ago. As a result, the old pastor is extremely abusive, has lost his faith in God, and is losing his congregation. YOUNG PASTOR becomes the turning point for the old pastor and his church; under YOUNG PASTOR the congregation grows. YOUNG PASTOR befriends BAKERY GIRL, whose father and estranged mother die. BAKERY GIRL grew up with her abusive father and struggles with her clumsiness (birth defect; prenatal alcohol abuse by her mother). BAKERY GIRL grew up thinking that her mother was an 'Italian' who had left her and her father to be an opera singer in Italy.  BAKERY GIRL learns that she has a sister, HAIRDRESSER, at their mother's funeral.  HAIRDRESSER grew up with the mother who drank a lot.  HAIRDRESSER'S mother was shown hospitalized and endured a lot of pain whimpering for more morphine drip before she died.  HAIRDRESSER likes ITALIAN TEACHER, who is an orphan with a temper and is best friends with HOTEL GUY. HOTEL GUY, who is insecure about his abilities, likes an ITALIAN WAITRESS. About 1/3 into the movie, the darkness and tension lightens and the happiness bubbles out.  Although the movie is in video format which was annoying to me initially, the characters seemed so real and the acting so amazingly natural that I didn't even remember or care about the format. I became engrossed in the plot and was rooting for the relationships to form between the characters who seem to be so deserving of each other. It is a comedy, not so much as making you laugh, but a comedy that makes you feel good. Each character has flaws, yet their pairings and friendship among the 6 of them bring out the best in all of them. This movie is a delightful surprise.  In the beginning I couldn't understand how it could be a comedy, because it started out so dramatic and dark, but at the end, I'm glad that I watched it through.  Yes, they all eventually visit Venice which makes the finale even more fun and charming.",1118016000,4,2635,4.653763440860215

I love the respectful way these people are presented despite all their ""faults"". Whether it's an extraordinarily clumsy person, a shy middle-aged bachelor or a lonely priest, you can feel that the director isn't out to ridicule anyone.

1736007,5,B00006ADFP,"As usual, ingore the wildly off-base U.S. Marketing campaign. The coverbox here - sexy female legs in an exotically supine position - is both misleading and insulting. This movie spends 92%+ of its time in a provincial Danish town. The subjects are death, loneliness, and breaking out of that loneliness via tentatively made connections. It's a brilliantly done movie by Dogme 95 adherent Lone Scherfig. Consider it 'von Trier light,' but that cover box is bound to set up some for disappointment.

 The Dogme style gives you a freshness you don't see in many Hollywood movies. In fact, 'Italian for Beginners' could almost pass for a home video (albeit one recorded by your Danish relatives).

 For you Dogme fans:

 - Pastor 'Andreas' is Anders Berthelsen, who played lead Kresten so memorably in 'Mifune.'

 - Stadium restaurant manager Halfinn is 'Mifune' star Iben Hjejle's live-in partner.

 - Ann Eleonora Jorgensen as Karen is - other than this movie - unknown to American audiences. A shame. Somebody hire this lady.",1090800000,10,1025,5.0476190476190474
1736008,3,B00006ADFP,"This is my first Dogme 95 film, so I guess that tells you that I don't get around much anymore (or at least get out to the movies as much as I'd like).  Apparently, the movement--with its emphasis on natural lighting, hand held cameras and an avoidance of other cinematic conventions that make for slick cinema--has any number of detractors (and only a few ardent supporters).  After viewing this film, I can see why.
ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS has a lot going for it.  The cast is attractive and talented.  The script is solid--the dialog natural, the plot a bit rambling and contrived in spots but certainly plausible.  The film addresses weighty themes (love and death, the weightiest of all) without becoming Nordically depressive.  It has a lightness of touch that is,  from all that I've read about Dogme, pretty unusual for the genre.
Called me spoiled, but I miss good cinematography.  Proponents of this apparent Dogme-tic rough, unpolished look will probably justify the movie's primitive quality as ""honest"" or ""authentic.""  I just think it looks like TV, low budget TV at that.  I notice one reviewer here referred to the film as a soap opera, and while he may have been talking plotline (and maybe it is a little on the soapy side, though not egregiously), he might just as well have been talking visuals.
Or you might compare it to an old Andy Warhol flick, one of those ""artlessness as art"" Paul Morrissey vehicles.  But those were supposed to be campy and trashy and offbeat.  Here the low tech look effectively undercuts the film's warmth and vibrancy.  The actors and the script deserve a bit better.",1087948800,8,1613,4.7797833935018055

The students of the class all get to know each other through a number of emotional experiences that tie there lives together along with the Italian class.  Italians for Beginners deals with a number of powerful issues such as death, love, hope, solitude, and forgiveness.  These issues are cleverly tied together as the audience witnesses the raw cinematography of Dogma 95, which enhances the realism of each scene.

1736041,3,B00006ADFP,"In spite of the title, ""Italian for Beginners"" features few Italian scenes, for it is set in a small town in Denmark, where men and women (all thirty-odd-year-old) fall in love through the language course.  The film is the 12th installment of Dogme 95 (its predecessors include ""King Is Alive"" or ""Mifune""), but unlike the usual films coming out of the tradition, ""Italian Beginners"" is a heart-warming romantic comedy, or at least, it wants to be that.
The ensemble characters are all timid or have some trouble with communication (perhaps making a contrast to Italian people).  They include; an angry manager of a small diner (who had once a promising career as football player), and his good-natured friend; a hairdresser whose alcoholic mother always stumbles into her shop in the awkward moment; a Catholic priest who is sent to the town for a thankless position; a female working at bakery store who had to change jobs more than 30 times; and a beautiful Italian waitress who fell for one of them.
Even though you like the film's life-affirming attitudes, you must admit that the story itself is nothing but an ordinary melodrama, which in itself is not a big problem.  I am not sure this film works as comedy in your country (I didn't find it as amusing as some people say), but it defenitely works as an intensely emotional drama.  The film has its strong moments (such as ill-treated daughter(s) confronting their parents), because the capable actors succeeded to infuse a lot of energy to the well-written, but slightly cliched characters.
I didn't give the film four stars because of the followinf two reasons: one, it lacks charms that should have, the kind of charms which the dogmatic stance of Dogme 95 destroyed.  Dogme basically forbids to use soundtrack songs, or lighting (except one attached to camera), both of which are (few people notice this) the essential part of the romanctic mood.  The actors' fine acting cannot save it totally.
The other defect comes from the film's script.  I don't know about Lone Sherfig (writer and director of the film), but it is clear that her roots lie in TV dramas, in which she can let the drama sprawl more freely.  The film runs 112 minutes, but with this thin material, the whole film is often repetitive, longer than it should be by 15 minutes.
But all in all ""Italian for Beginners"" is a good film, by ""good"" I mean ""warm"" ""engaging"" and ""charming.""  But I still do not understand why Ms. Sherfig, with these able cast at hand, decided to use the Dogme format, which does not help the film at all.",1083456000,2,2559,4.745495495495495

Shot as a video rather than as a cogent hang-together movie, there's a bit of a slap-dash quality about this one that is part of why it's a little hard to become engaged at the beginning - but it turns out to be its biggest appeal by the end.

The great accomplishment of the film's director, Lone Scherfig, is her ability to transfer very specifically Danish cultural aspects to a broader audience. Along the way you get both hilarious and touchingly sad moments and fine acting, all around.

Instead, it was a poorly-filmed, poorly-written, poorly-acted soap opera about a bunch of people in a Danish town who meet as a result of a little-attended Italian language class. This premise might have still worked if it were done right, but it looks like a home movie, and it seems the people who praise it are the ones who think any film that doesn't come from Hollywood is a great classic.

It's not a classic, not even in a ""so-bad-it's-good"" sense. The plot is about a recently-widowed pastor hired for the town church to fill in for the regular one who has been suspended, and other major characters include a hairdresser with a dying mother, a bakery employee who keeps dropping things and who has an obnoxious dying father, an obnoxious and self-absorbed young restaurant manager, an Italian waitress who wants a husband, and other similarly clichd characters who are neither developed nor likable. The story jumps from one scene to another, featuring a few mild laughs but no actual good parts. After two-thirds of the way I just gave up, deciding there would be no payoff.

You cannot always judge a DVD by its cover, or by the fact that it is called a ""classic"". Beware of that term; you might be disappointed.",1488672000,,1321,4.617021276595745

7966094,5,B00006ADFP,"This film is so clever, sad and emotionally touching, complex yet subtle; it is deeply evocative and was my foray into Danish film where I realized the Danes are Masters in the art of emotional drama.  Italian for Beginners is such a wonderful film; it treats very difficult and sensitive issues with the compassion and sensitivity they deserve while maintaining a lightness that can only be achieved through masterful direction and filmmaking.
This film is a work of art- nothing less; and the person who gave it one star obviously failed to see its greatness shared by the viewers of the greatest film festivals throughout the world including Tribeca, and Cannes.",1475107200,,665,4.990990990990991
