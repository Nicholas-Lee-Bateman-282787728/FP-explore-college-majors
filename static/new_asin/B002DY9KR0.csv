3913780,5,B002DY9KR0,"We have all the existing Jane Austin DVDs.  Had to get this one too.  I liked it very much.  Always like to see how different actors/directors handle Miss Jane. Joanna David is great as Elinor.  Robin Ellis is as colorless and shy as I think Miss Austin wanted him to be.  No wonder Marianne was underimpressed.
The filming is very old style Masterpiece Theatre similar to The First Churchills.  It's a bit stagy, but a very good, satisfying version.",1255651200,40,450,4.632911392405063
3913781,3,B002DY9KR0,"She was an excellent Elinor. I also liked that she was portrayed very pretty. All the other adaptations I have seen, portray Elinor of average attractiveness, even though the actresses portraying Elinor were very attractive in real life. I also liked that Elinor and Marianne looked enough alike that they could be sisters.

  What I did not like, was Edward was portrayed as shy, insecure and bumbling. It also seemed to me Marianne was portrayed much too self centered and selfish, much more than her character who was somewhat selfish in the novel, should have been. This portrayal overshadowed Marianne's good qualities, such as the deep love and loyalty she felt for her mother and sisters.

  Which is another  disappointment, I also missed  that there was no Margaret in this adaptation. I missed that in the 1981 adaptation also, but that adaptation otherwise I found very good.

  I did find I enjoyed the portrayal of Colonel Brandon and Willoughby the best in this adaptation. Both were much more likable in this.

  It seemed there were several scenes and dialogue, either added or changed, from the novel, which I disliked. I felt this was the most unfaithful adaptation I have seen.

  Bottom line, if you are a Janeite, or a loyal fan of BBC period fiction adaptations, you will still want to add this to your collection. However, I  believe you will find you prefer the 1981, or the 1995 or the 2008 adaptations, over this.",1254614400,11,1439,4.8040816326530615

3913783,4,B002DY9KR0,"While this 1971 version of Jane Austen classic Sense and Sensibility is not my most favorite, it is cute and so different than the other adaptions. Come on, 1971, what did we look like in 1971? Some of the reviews were really harsh regarding costuming and wigs. Im sure this was a low budget endeavor and they were doing the best they could. The older BBC classis movies pride themselves on staying true to Austens work. That is why I so love the BBC Classic movies. I have as many of the adaptions as I can find and am thrilled to have this one in my collection.",1459209600,,563,4.271028037383178

3913790,1,B002DY9KR0,"So disappointing. This version was acted and directed like a high school stage play (no offense to high school plays). The actress playing Marianne was too mercurial, and the actor playing Sir John used some sort of phony Scottish (or Irish?) accent. Other performances could have been tolerable but for the implausible acting around them and the stilted dialog they had to work with. Making matters worse, the hairdos, makeup and costumes belonged to 1970 instead of 1805.

3913794,3,B002DY9KR0,"A curious adaptation for it's omissions and staging.  It seems to have been written for the stage rather than film with limited sets and little transition between scenes. The actors play their roles well but Marianne's is more petulant than romantic, Edward's emotionless rather than sober, Sir John's overly bucolic, Willoughby's much too sympathetic; and of course - Margaret is missing.  In my opinion it rates well below the excellent 2008 BBC DVD with Janet McTeer and Dan Stevens, but slightly better than the one with Hugh Grant as Edward.",1430870400,,546,5.055555555555555

3913796,5,B002DY9KR0,"There are some parts of this that are SO unintentionally laugh out loud funny, that this one is not to be missed. Also, it's great to see ""Aunt Gardiner"" from A&E's P&P in a younger role. As my husband said ""She was quite a dish!"", and every bit as good an actress back then, too. She is, perhaps, my favorite Elinor next to the latest Masterpiece Classics version. And I own them all. Marianne is atrocious... as she should be. And who cannot delight in Patricia Routledge as Mrs. Jennings? She is FANTASTIC in the role. I only wish the men in the story were better acted. Edward is awful, with his obvious fake stutter, and wincing ways. And John Willoughby is too old, and not as charming and likeable as he should be (prior to discovery, of course). Only Colonel Brandon does not entirely disappoint.",1426118400,4,804,4.513698630136986

3913804,5,B002DY9KR0,"This adaptation holds it's place securely on dramatical merit; and my collection would be incomplete without it. As an Austen enthusiast I found it very interesting to watch, and enjoyed the refreshing contrast it brought me. I gave it an excellent score because the acting genius of Patricia Ruthledge(KEEPING UP APPEARANCES)as Mrs. Jennings added such dramatic zest to the entire movie; I also vote their Colonel Brandon in this adaptation as the handsomest and most gentlemanly of all.

3913805,3,B002DY9KR0,"First, the best part is Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth in Keeping Up Appearances) as Mrs. Jennings. She's a good bit younger. The same silly laugh and pretentious demeanor.

Gross overacting on the parts of Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor and Marianne. And just about everyone else, too. Elinor is so deadpan and uninteresting, as is Colonel Brandon. Some deviations from the book, but nothing very important. Costumes are nice and pretty much accurate. Elinor's hairstyle is more a la Gone With the Wind. The men largely have big hair. Dialogue is pretty much like the book.

To quote my husband, who has been subjected to every version of every Jane Austen movie, ""This one is even more boring than the others."" This could mean it's even better than most. Alas, that's not true. It IS more boring than the others. This one is nowhere near as good as the 1995 Emma Thompson (my favorite S&S) but worth seeing.",1395619200,,898,4.787096774193548

3913813,5,B002DY9KR0,"One thing that I really noticed about this movies is that Marianne was so dramatic and romantically unreasonable.  I loved the way her sister Elinor had a way of pulling her up short when she had to and with such firm finesse.  Willoughby was scandalous.  The action in this movie was great and of course I really like Colonel Brandon and Edward Ferrars.  I missed Margaret Dashwood in this movie but she came back in others.  I found myself wondering how I would react if my father died, I had to move from my home to a faraway place and meet new friends.  That is one of the things you do when you read or view this story.  Very enjoyable.  I loved the different view of the Dashwood family.",1370131200,,693,4.317829457364341

3913816,4,B002DY9KR0,"Probably the rarest of all TV adaptations of the delightful Jane Austen romance, the 1971 BBC miniseries of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY comes to DVD for the very first time, and is bound to enchant Austen devotees and newcomers alike.  We're probably very lucky to still have it, considering that most of the BBC productions during this period were later wiped from their archive.

SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is the story of two sisters, poles apart in their attitude and countenance, but on equal footing when it comes to the follies and foibles of romance.  Forced to move out of their beloved estate Norland after their father's death, the Dashwood sisters Elinor (Joanna David) and Marianne (Ciaran Madden), together with their mother (Isabel Dean), are now expected to live on a drastically reduced income--begrudgingly provided by their half-brother--in a small cottage that has been allotted to them by a distant cousin at Barton Park.  At their new home of Barton Cottage, Marianne meets Willoughby (Clive Francis), a dashing but reckless playboy; whilst Elinor, in turn, awaits infrequent visits from Edward Ferrars (Robin Ellis), her shy brother-in-law.  It's during a fateful trip to London with Mrs Jennings (Patricia Routledge) that both girls discover shattering revelations about their respective would-be beau's.

I really cannot understand the amount of reviewers criticising this version; granted it's not as ""slick"" as the modern Jane Austen attempts seen on the BBC and other networks (in that respect we've been greatly spoiled in the last few years), but it still tells the story (in four 45-minute episodes), and the performances on the whole are very solid--sometimes a bit stagey--however this is a problem you'll nevertheless find on most TV programmes of the era.  Screenwriter Denis Constanduros went on to pen the treatment for the BBC's 1972 miniseries of ""Emma"", which is held in high regard by most Austen-philes.

Joanna David brings a sweet tranquilness to the role of Elinor, and is beautifully counterbalanced by Ciaran Madden's impossibly romantic, almost feverish Marianne.  Her's is perhaps the most stagebound performance in the whole piece; however let us not forget that Ms Madden was a classically trained actress and had, in the previous year, turned in a lovely Ophelia in a TV version of ""Hamlet"".  Patricia Routledge (social-climbing horror Mrs Bucket herself) is a joy playing warm-hearted Mrs Jennings.  All things considered this is an excellent production.",1326672000,4,2496,5.293670886075949
3913817,4,B002DY9KR0,"I just received this fine BBC version of Sense and Sensibility and I sat down to watch with great anticipation and was not dissapointed.  How nice to see Patricia Routledge as a young actress.  This version, while it is a bit dated (1971), was a joy to watch.  The costumes and scenery were right and the story version was true to the novel with some ommisions. The acting was not what we are used to now - still this version has merit. The part of Elinor was done well.  Austen fans will love it.",1312329600,,497,4.25531914893617
3913818,4,B002DY9KR0,"If you're not against watching older adaptations with low production values, you will probably highly enjoy this version of Sense and Sensibility. The acting was mostly good- Joanna David was excellent (and quite beautiful) as the sensible Elinor. Patricia Routledge was another standout as Mrs. Jennings. She was absolutely hilarious yet also showed the character's kind nature. Robin Ellis (who you may recognize as Ross Poldark) even had a ""sexed-up"" scene as Edward.

Some of the acting/casting was less than perfect, however. Ciaran Madden played Marianne as borderline insane- going into hysterics all the time. Her and Colonel Brandon's storyline wasn't given as much screen time as the Elinor/Edward story so it may feel underdeveloped in comparison. Lucy Steele looks close to 40 and is so obviously evil one wonders how she ever could have charmed Edward. Lady Middleton's actress looks older than her supposed mother, Mrs. Jennings! (Maybe they could have given Patricia Routledge a gray wig to make her look older?) Eliza Williams was oddly made into Colonel Brandon's niece...(so why can't he just tell everyone she's his niece?).

A lot of the costumes/hairstyles are quite...70s. And of course, the production values are not up to the standard you may be used to today. But I didn't let this bother me and was able to thoroughly enjoy this version.",1304294400,,1363,5.16289592760181
3913819,4,B002DY9KR0,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  I recently watched the earliest BBC version of Emma and was disappointed.  I was expecting similar acting in this film, but from the first half hour, I could tell I wouldn't feel that way.  I was tempted to write a review before I finished watching it, I was so pleased!

What I enjoy most about this film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility is the cast!  Elinor was just wonderful.  One other reviewer commented that she was made attractive, whereas most Elinors in other adaptations were made to look plain.  I too, enjoyed that Elinor was beautiful in this movie.  In truth, I don't remember from the book whether Elinor is supposed to be plain or attractive.

Marianne was, I think very good.  There were a couple of times she seemed to be over the top, but from what I remember of the story, that could be a reasonable portrayl.

Edward was very good.  Mrs. Jennings was fabulous.  The Misses Steeles were very good, I thought.  A big improvement over some some of the later movies.  Willoughby was fine - I don't think the audience is given enough time to be drawn to him.  Sir John Middleton, outrageous as he is, does seem to fit the book, as I remember it.

There are two reasons I gave this adaptation a four rather than a five.  The first is that there were several marked differences in dialogue and events.  The youngest Miss Dashwood is eliminated, which I think is unfortunate, as her presence helps to endear Edward to the audience (and to Elinor).  Also, at the end of the story, Elinor's emotional outburst has been eliminated.  I felt that THAT was an inexcusable omission.  Elinor is so calm throughout the story that her emotions getting the better of her is a very significant part of the story.  There were other, smaller, differences as well. It is still decently faithful, even with those changes.

The second reason is that the ending seemed a bit awkward.  It sort of just fades out, and it doesn't feel like it should end there.  I found that unfortunate, since I felt that the execution of the film was very good throughout the whole three hours . . until the very last two minutes!

One other difficulty (which had no affect on my rating) was that the camera seemed at times to be unfocused.

But I really enjoyed it throughout!  The acting in the very first minute or two felt ""stagy"" (a term a couple of other reviewers have used), but it really didn't feel that way to me for the rest of the movie.",1295568000,3,2481,4.512359550561798
3913820,2,B002DY9KR0,"As a retired literature professor, sixty-two year old male, and avid supporter of the notion of Jane Austen's literary genius, I also feel obliged to partake of all the cinematic versions of her work.  When I encounter any of her novels that are not terribly well done on the screen, I find it quite perplexing, as Jane's writing is very visual - she usually shows us what she means, or what the characters are thinking, or what impression she wishes us to take, rather than merely telling us directly - and for this reason should translate very well to the screen.  The most recent productions; that of the Emma Thompson and Ang Lee collaboration, and the most recent Andrew Davies adaptation tend to support this thesis.  Both are quite good, take minimal liberties and develop the characters in a very thorough way.  For my own taste, the Andrew Davies will be the standard for quite some time.  It is quite well cast and the score is haunting; even the seaside setting - very different from Jane's own - adds to rather than detracts from the experience.

My first impression of this 1971 version was that someone had turned it into a play, and I was watching a stage production.  As noted in other reviews, there are many inaccuracies of style, fact and setting, the dialogue is truly often quite too exaggerated, and the characters rather over-played.  I made it through this once and was very unhappy with it.  As soon as I can work up the courage, I will have another go at it while trying to maintain an open mind.

This version is only for the scholarly curious (as I am) or die hard Jane Austen fan.  If you can't have them all; to my knowledge only four are available: this 1971 BBC effort, the Irene Richard 1981 BBC version, the 1995 Emma Thompson/Ang Lee big screen version, and the 2008 BBC production adapted by Jane Austen veteran Andrew Davies.  As is so often the case, if you only want one, get the Davies.  This first BBC production is not for the faint of heart.",1295222400,5,1984,4.53932584269663
3913821,4,B002DY9KR0,"Note: Although the Amazon.com heading implies that this is a 2009 adaptation, the 2009 only refers to the DVD release date. In reality, this adaptation is the 1971 BBC adaptation, which is not to be confused with the 1981 BBC adaptation.

MY VIEWPOINT:

Having read Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" twice and having watched the following adaptations of Sense and Sensibility: 1971, 1981, 1996, and 2009, I certainly believe this adaptation captures the intent of Austen's novel better than any of the any other adaptations. Of course, this will create a dated production but hardly a humorless one.

This 1971 Giles adaptation captures quite well the personalities of Mrs. Jennings and Lucy Steele. Rare is the adaptation of ""Sense and Sensibility"" in which you sympathize with Mrs. Jennings and believe her to be (despite her gossipy personality) a character with whom other characters can sympathize. Lucy, through her tone of voice and body language, is played as a cunning young lady rather than a naive one when she admits to Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged for years. In other words, Lucy is aware that she is hurting Elinor when she tells her about Edward's engagement. Also, Elinor and Marianne do not seem in this adaptation to be quite as much the embodiment of complete sense and complete sensibility, which is how the 1981 Barron adaptation portrays them.

The plot of this 1971 Giles adaptation is very similar to the novel, as are all the adaptations. A few negatives do exist, naturally. Margaret's character is cut, although this might have been expected. Also, the adaptation implies that Radcliffe wrote ""The Castle of Otranto,"" which, in my view, is a careless error.

Overall, however, the production kept my attention, certainly better than the 1981 Barron BBC adaptation, in which both Mrs. Jennings and Lucy are like caricatures from a Dickens novel.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
I believe the adaptation is worthy for those who enjoy Austen. For those who prefer a more modernized adaptation, the 2008 Davies adaptation [or even the Thompson adaptation] might be better worth your time.

Finally, if you can tolerate the 1981 Baron adaptation [I hated it], this adaptation should not cause your eyes or ears too much pain.",1291420800,12,2256,5.048387096774194
3913822,4,B002DY9KR0,"OK, Willoughby's wig is appalling. Marianne is painfully earnest and self-absorbed (but that's the point, isn't it?). Yet this BBC adaptation of the Austen Classic has lots to offer British TV fans. Notably, Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner in the Colin Firth P & P) as Elinor - exuding class and proper reserve in every facially nuanced expression, Patricia Routledge (Keeping Up Appearances) wonderfully larger than life as the warm-hearted if gossipy Mrs Jennings, and Robin Ellis (of Poldark fame) underplayed but brilliant in scene of excruciating embarrassment when Edward Ferrars arrives to find his love closeted with his now deeply regretted fiancee Lucy Steele, and to make matters worse is then championed by the unwitting Marianne.

3913823,1,B002DY9KR0,"I was interested in seeing this version particularly because I loved 'Poldark' and thought Robin Ellis and Clive Francis would be interesting to see, and I always thought the BBC could do no wrong. Oops. Clive Francis as Willoughby was not nearly as much a cad as I thought he should be, and I think Robin Ellis had a little too much gravitas to carry off the role of Ferrars - he is the polar opposite of Hugh Grant's Ferrars. I found it all too difficult to watch - I was always gaping at the 70's hairstyles (why do they give women soooo much hair? Willoughby's voluminous faux-victorian tousled hair nearly stole the show). The lighting was amateurish and the female actors were over-the-top. One notable exception was Patricia Routledge as Mrs. Jennings, who is over-the-top in her own right. Please don't bother with this. There are far, far better adaptations out there.",1279238400,3,877,4.738562091503268
3913824,2,B002DY9KR0,"I bought this version because we needed it to complete our collection.  I doubt we will ever watch it again, after viewing it once.  It was painful to watch: most of the players seemed miscast, the hairstyles were straight from the late 1960's early 1970s, , and the emotions were stated but never shown by the players.  We actually hoped Marianne would die and be put out of her (acting) misery.  All my wife kept saying while we watched this version was ""I hope you didn't pay much for this DVD"".  Definitely the worst of any of the BBC attempts at Sense and Sensibility.",1272931200,,573,4.471153846153846
3913825,2,B002DY9KR0,"The problem with dong well-known classics is that there is a level of expectation based on other productions; although this is a BBC production, it does not rise to the level of other films.  The acting is hesitant, the lines delivered teleprompter fashion.  There seems to be little interaction between the characters who are in the scene together, but could well be on their cell phones the way the lines are delivered. Sorry to pan any Austen story, but there it is.",1265500800,6,469,4.7073170731707314
3913826,4,B002DY9KR0,"I'm collecting as many video dramatizations of Jane Austen's novels as I can lay my hands on.  I particularly prefer the ""older"" BBC versions to some of the newer because of the longer run times ... meaning there is more of the book on the screen.  And the British are renown for being ""faithful"" to their dramatization of classic literature.  Although the actors are certainly older than the characters they are portraying, I still liked this version being familiar with so many of those actors from other Masterpiece Theatre and/or BBC productions I've viewed on PBS over the years.

This nearly three-hour version features ""salad days"" performances by Joanna David, Patricia Routledge, Robin Ellis and Clive Frances (adversaries in the POLDARK mini-series) and when you factor in that this 1971 mini-series had never aired in this country made it a ""must"" purchase.  I was not disappointed, and would recommend it to other Austen addicts like myself.",1263859200,33,953,5.083333333333333
3913827,3,B002DY9KR0,"I don't have a lot to say about this film since it is neither the best nor the least appealing of the Sense and Sensibility productions.  The only problem with all of them except for the ""Hugh Grant version"" is the homeliness of the Edwards.  Can't a clergyman of English persuasion be handsome even though he be a physical bumbler?  Oh, well, the story is all there, but because it is not a BBC extravaganza, some of the perhaps minor details have been omitted.  Yet, it's worth the viewing, especially for comparative purposes, and Maryanne and Elinor are lovely creatures--a bit stiff though.  Their mother is lovely and Mrs. Jennings is wonderful.  Since the film is several decades old, the color isn't quite up to snuff, but all in all, Mrs. Jennings makes the film work.",1258329600,5,777,4.676470588235294
3913828,3,B002DY9KR0,"I had to have this recently retrieved from the vaults Austen adaptation because I try to see every filmed take on her works.  Joanna David truly shines as Elinor.  Madden's Marianne is problematic at first; she seems so thoroughly self-absorbed, that you doubt how her sister can be so attached to her.  Although too much of the dialogue is not true to the novel, the screenplay succeeds well in depicting the sobering effects of genuine emotional suffering in Marianne.  She is genuinely less trite, and much more introspective after her ordeal. Although her looks will always be a draw, the viewer knows that the way has been paved for her to experience the genuine unconditional love which Willoughby's fear of poverty prohibited....It was a joy to see a younger Patricia Routledge in the role of Mrs. Jennings!.....It was however, easier to see Sir John Middleton as a well-respected Shopkeeper of sorts than as a fine country gentleman, although he accurately depicted the warmth and generosity of Austen's creation......The Steele sisters were dead-on; they were as grasping and uncultured as Jane Austen showed us.  We must understand that we can't ""hate on"" Lucy too much.  In that era, lower Middle-Class (and some genuinely Middle-Class) mothers bordered on socially ""prostituting"" their daughters to make up for the lack of a real dowry.  There was such a fear that an unmarried daughter would settle into spinsterhood and further drain a family's meager resources, that mothers (and sometimes fathers) would literally brainwash their daughters into utilizing excessive flattery, and overall catering to the landed gentry as a key weapon in their arsenal to trap a wealthy man.  Such a man could perhaps elevate the standard of living of the gal's entire family!......Not without imperfections, this adaptation of Sense&Sensibility is still worth watching.",1258329600,15,1867,5.241610738255034
3913829,3,B002DY9KR0,"When this popped up in my Netflix queue, I was excited because I'm quite an Austen fanatic, and have most of the DVDs of the various adaptations. I had never watched this particular BBC adaptation, and so was eager to watch it before purchasing it. I found this to be a tepid adaptation of Austen's classic and the worst of all the adaptations. My ranking of the various adaptations of Sense and Sensibility as as follows:
The movie version starring Emma Thompson (1995) - there's nothing I dislike about this adaptation:)
Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 2008 - haunting score, beautiful cinematography, faithful in most respects, and excellent casting, especially the role of Elinor, which was played by Hattie Morahan)
Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 1981 - very faithful to the novel, but the actors are not very appealing)

This 1971 BBC adaptation is truly pathetic - the acting by some of the characters seem over the top, and the portrayal of Sir John was truly annoying. The actor playing Willoughby was the least attractive of all the Willoughby's in the various adaptations and I felt he was horribly miscast. The actors playing the sisters, Elinor and Marianne were well-cast, especially the character of Elinor, portrayed by Joanna David, who coincidentally went on to play Elizabeth Bennet's (Jennifer Ehle) aunt in the iconic 1996 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Joanna David's Elinor is sweet and sensible, and shines in her role. The other notable actor was Patricia Routledge as Mrs Jennings. Routledge went on to attain fame in her role as the pompous Mrs Bucket in ""Keeping Up Appearances"".

The feature itself runs about 3 hours, and there are some changes in the dialogue compared to Austen's novel. The props and setting give this production the appearance of being a theater production, and some of the actors appear stilted and awkward in their roles. I think I will still purchase this, if only because I wish to have a collection of all the various adaptations of Austen's works, but I have to say that this is the worst adaptation of Sense and Sensibility compared to the others I have viewed.",1256601600,33,2115,4.905027932960894
3913830,3,B002DY9KR0,"This 1971 production is the first of the BBC's 3 adaptations of Sense & Sensibilty and as far as I am aware is presented here on DVD for the first time. It's a passable effort, the casting could be better and it has a somewhat stagey feel, but overall is alright but not outstanding. It runs for about 3 hours, the video and sound quality are excellent and it has subtitles. It's presentation on DVD is marred by advertising and the failure to edit out the inter-episode credits. Probably only for Jane Austen die-hards. Now, what about the 1967 version of Pride & Prejudice (with Celia Bannerman and Lewis Fiander)?",1256083200,27,616,4.609090909090909
3913831,1,B002DY9KR0,"This is the most charmless adaptation of S&S on the market.  The dialogue is woeful, the costuming and hairstyling are laughably inaccurate, and the acting equals the very finest balsa wood.  Even for the 1970s, this is garbage.  Only Patricia Routledge turns in a performance that has any merit.  Obviously made before anyone at the BBC twigged that the trick with Jane Austen is to use as many of her own words as humanly possible.  Worth buying for curiosity value as a relic of the era when TV dramas looked like your local suburban amateur theatre production.  No stars.",1255824000,14,575,4.757575757575758
8366261,3,B002DY9KR0,"Bought 'cause I like both Jane Austen and Patricia Routledge.

It is VERY dated a la 1971. Kinda fascinating because of this. Seems like they had a limited budget.  Not enough outdoor scenes.

But if you're a big fan of Austen films/series you'll probably want to add this to your collection.  Ms. Routledge is a treat, as usual.  I watched this for the first time, whilst in the middle of binge watching ""Keeping Up Appearances"",so it was a bit of a gear shift, to be sure :-)
