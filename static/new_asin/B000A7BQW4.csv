8075410,2,B000A7BQW4,"Jason Goodis (Bob Dougherty) likes to paint, smack women, take hostages, and rob banks. Unfortunately he is not very good at it. While running from the law, Jason ends up in a mansion with Elle (Cecilia Bergqvist) a woman who likes sex, posing naked, and liver.

The film is not good. The ridiculous amateur added features in the second film made it better, and almost viewable. The newscasters were boring. The additions lacked imagination and consisted of a lot of breathing and fart humor. This production certainly does not display the genius of Woody Allen's ""What's Up Tiger Lilly."" While I would like to see more films gutted and have new voice overs, I wouldn't want Kaufman involved.

The film...what was that? Zombie mummies? From where? What made them?

8075411,4,B000A7BQW4,"original movie is an awful attempt from the ones that did Rabid Grannys. It could have been a decent flick if they bothered to develop a full storyline, had better editing, and better costume people that poor actress had to do  first part of film in only her panties. The zombies looked more like mummies. The tromatic version is better of the two films.",1405123200,,354,4.53125
8075412,5,B000A7BQW4,"ok parts of the family is a decent movie, however the fact that the troma version of the movie is just a  bunch of stock footage and other stuff edited in is terrible and to add insult to injury i actually thought actors who were credited for being in the movie were not actually in it but stock footage was just added from other stuff was a dissapointment example trey parker is said to be in it i could say i was in titanic record myself drinkin a beer on a boat edit it in somewhere and be credited whatever i guess",1351728000,,518,4.078431372549019
8075413,3,B000A7BQW4,"As you may already know, this contains two versions of the movie: the serious version, which is (or would like to be) a straight horror movie, the other one the Troma version (which has additional scenes, has been re-editet and re-dubbed).
I first watched the original cut, which starts okay with a hostage-situation and a sexy chick (the main actress definetely is the highlight of the movie). It continues promising with some gory flashbacks and reminds me of movies like ""The Beyond"" or ""Hellraiser"". Later on it becomes a confusing mess with silly fights between police-men and zombies (which are dressed like mummies) and the sexy chick unable to decide whether she wants to save or kill her undead friends. There is even a zombie painting a picture with entrails. Interesting to say the least. Overall it is a little bit to silly and a little bit to boring, but I have seen worse.
Much more entertaining I think is the Troma version. Llody Kaufman's part has been extended and he delivers some funny comentaries throughout the movie, for example complaining how bad the original movie is. A lot of the more annoying scenes have been cut out too, so the Troma version is shorter than the original one, although it contains a lot of additional footage (some of it was obviously taken from behind-the-scenes shots from the original movie). And last but not least: It features an introduction by Stan Lee!!",1334275200,,1408,4.822314049586777
8075414,5,B000A7BQW4,This film has two movies- a regular one and a Troma one. I watched the Troma version first because I thought it would have more gore. Well its the same but its one of the funniest horror comedys ive ever seen. Kaufman was good as the blind director in Terror Firmer but this is a better performance. Kaufman put on one of the funniest performances ive seen in a very long time. He played a more serious role in the orignal film but he does much better in the Troma version. All lines in the Troma film have been redubbed and are very funny. The Gay Sniper is probably the greatest character in a comedy since the French Guard in Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Ive watched the movie about three times in the past few days because I cant stop watching Kaufman's performance. Its a excellent movie- both of them. Highly recommended film. Both have some pretty cool gore and nudity. What else you expect from Troma?,1199232000,5,913,4.408284023668639
