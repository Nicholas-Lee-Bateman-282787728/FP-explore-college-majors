Michael Curtiz directed this fictionalized, unabashedly flag waving biopic of the first actor to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor, George M. Cohan. A delightful musical that covers his boyhood rise in late 19th Century vaudeville to national acclaim in the early 20th. There are recreations from several of George's stage hits, including LITTLE JOHNNY JONES (1904), the first American musical.

Cagney delights with singing and loose-jointed dancing, especially in the title song (from the previously mentioned ""Jones""). He's outstanding in an Oscar-winning turn as the man they erected a statue to on Broadway. Highest recommendation!
