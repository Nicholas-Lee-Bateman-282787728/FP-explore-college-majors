7936772,2,B00005B6LF,"Starring the star of ""Shaolin Soccer"" and his sidekick, this comedy spans the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to Hong Kong.  It's the story of a man named Sing (yep, same name as the ""Shaolin Soccer"" hero) who is transformed after being caught in a platonic affair with the wife of a Japanese yakuza boss.  He then tames a school of unruly brats and conques the evil boss and his underlings.  The movie has some funny moments, and the last few minutes are quite funny as Sing dresses as an old woman (must be a Hong Kong celebrity of some sort), but overall it feels just stupid, pointless, and crude.  The subtitles, poorly translated and edited as always, scroll by too fast.  The computer-animated special effects bring to mind ""Men in Black"" and even ""Roger Rabbit"", and Chow's acting looks like a shadowy Jim Carrey at times, but this is pure Hong Kong trash.  Definitely not as good or memorable as ""Shaolin Soccer"" -- except the sexy Asian kitten from Singapore who plays the yakuza boss' wife.",1104364800,3,995,4.625
7936773,5,B00005B6LF,"This is a crazy dumb exciting mind-blowing amazing movie. I've never seen anything like this before... This movie has many turns in the plot that make the story really interesting. I have all SC's movies and this is one of my fav (along with ""God of cookery"" ""From Beijing with love"" ""Royal tramp"" and ""Shaolin soccer""). I especially liked the Pulp Fiction parody. Stephen Chow is always the best!",1054684800,2,397,4.768115942028985

Luckily a mad scientist helps refurbish his body into some normality, but with interestingly new  abilites.  Watch as Stephen Chow takes out the mob with his new Inspector  Gadget body.
