8210124,5,B000TLONE4,"This is an excellent well-researched documentary of the complex issues and realities in Guatemala.  The execution is flawless, the film is absolutely provocative and empathetic with how a young who's been through all that Jos&eacute; was might feel.  When Mr. Patrick Atkinson describes how he was and says ""for lack of a better word, he was torn, he was very street smart, but somebody who was also inside BLEEDING WITH LONELINESS, WITH SADNESS"", I say: He couldn't have chosen better words! He captures Jos&eacute;'s heart and feelings and articulates them perfectly!  I know first hand how it feels not having loving parents.  I never experienced poverty, my grandma adopted me and I grew with wealth, but I know and I totally relate with Mr. Atkinson's words.  Just another reason to respect and admire more the work of God's Child Project and his great leader.

I recommend this movie, I think movies like this must be seen in all the Latin America schools, specially in the private schools, where we have everything and we live in the other reality of Guatemala, films like this could raise awarness of our own reality and probably inspire us to do something to help our Guatemalan brothers and sisters.  Sad & real movie.",1308441600,,1228,4.875

8210126,5,B000TLONE4,"The life of Jose Antonio Gutierrez is used as the backdrop for this well-researched documentary that explores complex issues and realities most American's have little awareness of.  Among them are: immigration, genocide, street children, poverty, green card soldiers and our involvement in other lands.  The film is provocative, emotional, at times, and beautifully constructed.  Can an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala become an American war hero?  You decide.",1209254400,6,466,5.91044776119403
8210127,5,B000TLONE4,"""The Short Life of Jose Antonio Gutierrez"" is a story that every U.S. citizen should learn.  We like to view ourselves as the liberators of the world, spreading democracy and loved by all.  Oftentimes, we cite the large numbers of immigrants coming here as evidence of our glory; but rarely do we take a close look as to why so many countries are experiencing economic problems or military conflicts.  This documentary (made in Europe) takes a look at why a person like Gutierrez was living on the streets of Guatemala City, and how he ended up serving in the forces of the world's hyperpower.  The film talks about U.S. involvement in Guatemala's war, which killed over 200,000 people, traumatized countless others, and empowered a wealthy elite that runs the country in the interests of corporate fundamentalists.  Another documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-the-Mountains-Tremble/dp/B0002HOD7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When the Mountains Tremble</a>&nbsp;provides a more detailed look at the horror of the proxy war the U.S. waged in Guatemala.  The war shattered Jose's family, and he ended up in an orphanage.  He eventually made his way to the U.S., not because he thought it was such a wonderful country, but he recognized there are opportunities there to escape the difficult situation that wealthy nations have created throughout the Global South.  As with many young people without much money, Jose saw the military as a vehicle to provide money for college.  In addition to that, the Bush administration offered a more rapid process to become citizens if immigrants joined the military.  Hence, there are over 30,000 non-U.S. citizens serving in the U.S. military, and even more serving in U.S. based private military companies like Blackwater&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackwater-The-Rise-of-the-World-s-Most-Powerful-Mercenary-Army/dp/1560259795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army</a>.
This film raises many topics - U.S. foreign policy, immigration, the war on Iraq - and puts a literal human face on them in a very thoughtful, humane way.  We also see how the military becomes a sort of family and identity for people who find themselves alone or financially insecure.

Jose ended up being the first U.S. soldier killed in Iraq, and the U.S. media used his death to score PR points for its unjust war.  This film provides the nuance of Jose's story, and reaffirms the desperate need we have to escape the grip of what Martin Luther King called the ""giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism.""",1200182400,19,2879,6.012224938875305
