8476739,5,B005KCIH8A,"As expected, some very old movies of the students of the past. I would have liked some of the founder doing the arts, but I don't think there are any existing.  I have being doing Danzan Ryu Jujitsu for over 50 years, so this was very interesting to me.  I am glad I got it.",1506384000,,274,3.963636363636364
8476740,5,B005KCIH8A,"I studied Kodenkan Ju Jitsu with one of Okazaki's main students, Prof. Sig Kufferath. This is a great time capsule look at the entire Danzan Ryu system in its original form. I even like the quaint musical soundtrack, which gives it a great old-timey feel. The problem with styles of Ju Jitsu ( and other martial arts ) that are practiced this way is that you are only memorizing separate responses to attacks without developing the real fighting ability to use Ju Jitsu in a real life manner. Anybody studying an art like this should also do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to get the ability to use Ju JItsu in a spontaneous realistic manner.",1464739200,2,631,4.592920353982301
