5966817,4,B00F3OLV9M,"I like it. It did have some slow moments. But it needed more extras (background atmosphere) in the office and neighborhood scenes. It would of made it more life like.  But the wife was one of a kind.  A good thriller. I was an extra in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. The tall blonde red bone lady that is standing in back of Tatiana Ali. When the pastor says, ""Everyone stand"". I am wearing a purple dress.  The extras in that scene where only there for 3 hours. We worked with an organized production and filming crew.  Tyler Perry worked as an consultant on the movie.",1388707200,2,588,4.318181818181818

5966820,3,B00F3OLV9M,"this movie had way to many unanswered questions. the movie keeps your attention but your still
clueless at the end, the actors in this movie are top of line actors who I've seen in really good movies.
 but seriously they must have been paid well, to do this movie. save your money. you can see it free at (Viooz.co/)
and a few others . word from the wise check to make sure if this site has the movie your looking for,before
paying for it on amazon ...sorry but true",1388102400,3,466,4.235955056179775
5966821,3,B00F3OLV9M,"How did they get such good actors to do this movie without reading the script?

This is the first question I asked after viewing this movie. They actors HAD to have known that there were far too many holes in this story to get a viewer to understand.

This movie was all over the place. One scene there's no child. A second later, there's a 10 month old baby............Yes, that happened.

I have far too many questions that need answered when theres was a lot of room for them to be answered in the movie.",1388102400,,507,4.315789473684211

5966850,1,B00F3OLV9M,"Although I saw this quite a while ago, I had to rate it. Considering I loved some earlier and surprising, much of the latter work of O. H. and S. L, the main couple who acted in this film. The story line at the end just made me want to actually break DVD disc. Sorry, but it was crap. Like really..., it was said in an previous reviewer's post, about the potential this movie started out had great possibilites. Towards the breakdown, there were too many missing puzzle pieces and it appears that the budget lessened during production so they just wrapped it all up leaving you like.... WTH!!!! The wife is getting off for insane crimes and she is insane. I was upset that I spent the time watching it to the end. Like I menttioned before, both of the actors have had better previous and latter work, but this was a total waste, and unfinished, thrown together and lost concept of what could have been a new straight to DVD- favorite. They tried to make it a suspsene thriller, but it came off as a loving/hard-working/foolish husband who gives his all to the wife and she is sleep walking through her life and killing people.

You will be left with trying to understand why she got away with it?? 2, 3 times? Many times you will wonder if you missed something in the movie and sit there with a strange look on your face trying to understand. I was left with so many questions, but the one that seemed to remain constant throughout the movie for me is: Why didn't she just take her medicine?",1433030400,2,461,4.191011235955056

The plot is rotten I seen it on Netflix so I am so glad I did not pay for this movie. The at the end after she has killed another person, and she has their blood all over her dress another person takes the fall for it, and at the end it shows her and her friend driving off in her Mercedes with her house for sale, are you kidding me if I could give this movie zero stars I would have.

The endin was an huge surprise - the first time watching it I didn't get it at all but then the second time I understood why George did what he did! Now I will say this movie was fantastic it was pretty scary at times like a horror movie but the actors did such a great job acting it all out. This movie was low budget yet they did use great actors and to be honest I wish they showed this in the movie theater.

The cover image for this movie is perfect because you can see who has the problem.  The lead actress emits a brittle signal as if channeling Grace Zabriski.  Turns out she was raped as a child - but she also happens to be a narcissist which means she already feels owed and having something like that happen to a narcissist means an immense hole that will never be redressed so she is going to be thinking in tactical terms about how her mental illness will make her less desirable and making her alert to potential competition and the thought of losing will be unacceptable to her.",1420329600,,691,4.556451612903226

For instance, I was unsure of what she did with the baby the day hubby called from work for his report. He snatched her up saying what did you do, what did you do. Then they calmly go downstairs and have a conversation about nothing. I'm like did she kill him did she not kill him??

The three  things that made me mad  was Mike work situation which is a reflection of the job climate today. Mike was done dirty  by his job even though he bust his butt, then the interview he went on with the nasty interviewer. I wish in the movie they would have showed him suing his former company  or starting his own firm.
The second thing is the husband being late to act when he found out about his wife sleep disorder. His wife told him she wasn't talking her medicine and showed him she was  not capable of taking care of their son and he still allowed her to watch him. Then after she killed their son, he still remain married to her. If she can kill the baby, why wouldn't he think she couldn't kill him? Last thing is how the main character never face any consequences for her actions. What jury would let a woman off who killed her baby. Even if they felt she wasn't in her right mind she should have been confined to a mental institution. She kills her husband and get to ride off in the sunset. Mike should have listen to his mother.",1414281600,5,1190,4.247787610619469
5966908,3,B00F3OLV9M,"This movie was ok. It has a good premise & pacing but the plot left too many holes. Since it's not a big budget movie, they probably didn't have the money to do flashback sequences to show how the wife & her foster siblings became so close which was something that they hinted but never fully explained.  By the end, I had to make too many assumptions about events in order to make sense of it so that was disappointing.

All of the main actors were excellent given their material and had great chemistry - it was nice to see Lynn Whitfield, Gary Dourdan, Richard T Jones and even Roxie was good in her limited role.  Overall while I was glad to see a movie featuring Black actors, I would only recommend viewing this on Netflix or Hulu because I doubt it's a movie many would want to watch again - unless you just want to freeze frame Omari (LOL).",1414195200,4,848,4.2875

She got away with murder twice. If a person has a sleep disorder that causes them to kill people, they should be separated from society.  It was pure neglect on her part for not taking her medicine. Especially after she killed her baby. Hated this story.  The shock wasn't worth sacrificing what could have been a good story. Alternate ending suggested where she gets caught trying to kill her baby, sent to a mental hospital, escapes, finds grandma holding baby while husbands out, accidentally kills her, husband catches her, they struggle while baby is on the floor crying.  Her foster brother comes for whatever reason. Hears the struggle and calls out to wife.  Confused as to why her husband is attacking her she yells for her brother. He breaks in.  However somehow during the struggle she accidentally kills him. She then decides that's enough and kills herself before her husband can stop her. Husband moves to another city with baby and starts his own architecture firm.  Movie should be titled the secrets we keep.",1405468800,17,1183,4.850746268656716

Perhaps that is a way to say Catherine (Sharon Leal) who appears to be typical of a girl you meet on a web site. She marries Michael (Omari Hardwick). We know next to nothing about their courtship. Catherine has sleep issues. Michael has work issues. Catherine was raised in a foster home which burned down and killed the owner. George (Gary Dourdan) and Claudia (Rocsi) are her foster siblings who still live in the same upscale neighborhood. Catherine does horrible things in her sleep that no one can control and everyone covers up.

The acting was hit and miss. The supporting cast was downright bad. The script has holes in it. Michael's work situation was poorly scripted. Not entertaining. Not recommended.
