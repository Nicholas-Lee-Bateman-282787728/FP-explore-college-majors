8403778,1,B003RI4LWK,"When I saw this DVD [A Solid Foundation To Acoustic Bass], I was excited. I've seen Barry Bales perform and always thought he was an excellent Upright bass musician. What a disappointment. He is NOT a teacher. I certainly feel sorry for his students at ETSU. This is more of a interview, not a learning exercise. He never tells you the notes that he plays [don't think he knows] in a step-by-step on how to. And when questioned by the interviewer, he isn't sure what he played or what he did or why. There may be some help here but not for the beginner.

No close ups of the left hand. Nearly ALL shots are of the entire group--who cares? we're studing bass. Also, everything is ""after the fact."" He never says...""let me show you what I am talking about..."" or ...""let me play it slow for you...""

Barry appears lost at times, mumbling and rambling and not sure what he does when he plays. You may get a few tid-bits, maybe after you've played a year or so. I would recommend Purchasing Murphy Henry's DVD along with Ritchie Mintz's book.",1362960000,4,1038,4.429319371727749
8403779,5,B003RI4LWK,"Barry Bales gives some excellent advice for the beginner to the advanced. Not a formal classical instruction, but one geared towards bluegrass bass. He does an excellent job in giving advice on his style of playing bass. The only criticism is that when he is being interviewed the bass is tuned differently than when he is playing with the group, to my ear! Not all encompassing, but some good tips for the bluegrass bassist. Worth the money.",1294704000,,442,4.753246753246753
8403780,5,B003RI4LWK,"Lots of information for the person just learning or has been playing awhile. Interesting and informative. I've been playing awhile and it made a big improvement in what and how I could play when working on a song. I've played the interview portions ten times and got something different each time, I can't say that about some of the other instructional DVD's I got -- most are one and done.",1282435200,,390,4.585714285714285
