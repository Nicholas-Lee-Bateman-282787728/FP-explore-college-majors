8040747,5,B00069WF9E,"I remember the first time I saw this series and am terribly grateful they have released it to dvd.  Imagine the worst case secenario involving bachelors and their sometimes girlfriends that put up with them.  That is this show.  Their life revolves around women and the pub.  Not a very good pub at that.  They want a woman in their life but they do not want to want a woman in their life.  They enjoy days with the boys but they have almost no friends because everyone they know has grown up.  It is a great show to watch if you ever get depressed with your life, makes you believe that things could be worse.  The guys and girls work well together in this series and every episode is hilarious.",1217635200,,696,4.3

REAL ""must-see TV.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behaving-Badly-The-Complete-Collection-The-Original-British-TV-Series/dp/B000H6SXZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Collection (The Original British TV Series)</a>

My family discovered this series almost by accident, and adored it.  My son was too young to appreciate some of the dialogue, but even he could appreciate the slapstick which leavens the whole mixture.  Sure, some jokes require a little translation on the trip ""across the pond"" to America, but that's part of the charm.  And, at 20-minute episodes instead of being stretched to half-hour (as with American television), the action stays taut.",1197849600,,830,6.866666666666666
8040749,5,B00069WF9E,"I love this show. I can remember the very first time that I saw it on TV, I have never laughed of hard in my entire life.  I was glad when it was finally released on DVD in the US.  The first few seasons are pretty good and the show only gets better from there.  So, if you are a fan of British comedy then you should really check this show out.  It is much better than it's US counterpart ""Men Behaving Badly"".  Seasons 3 & 4 have also just been released, you should check them out as well.",1143936000,,491,3.919191919191919
8040750,5,B00069WF9E,"I am thrilled that this show has finally been released in the US.  I left my VHS collection behind when I arrived in the US some year ago and have truly missed watching this excellent comedy.  It was called `Men behaving badly' in England.  Out of all the Britcoms, this is one show that I have no idea how well it will travel across the pond.  Can be very heavy on slang and accents.  Basically the whole show revolves around two guys, Gary and Tony. Both are lazy louts who like to get drunk.  There was a pilot series made in the US but it flopped badly. I suspect because it was extremely tame in comparison and to enable it be shown on non cable before 11pm.

As with most good series, it gets better over time. Series 2 sees the arrival of Tony and is where the comedy takes off proper.",1111104000,,792,4.171052631578948
8040751,5,B00069WF9E,"This is the hilarioius English version, not the poor imitation staring Rob Schnieder.
In England I believe this show was known as It's a Man's World.  It's basically about a couple of blokes who share a flat and generally act like guys and refuse to grow up.  You know, drinking too much, trying lamely to get off with women and generally talking bullocks.  It's also about the relationship between Gary and Dorothy who stay together because, well it's hard to say really.
It may take a few episodes to get into this, but I have been hooked for a long time now.  You can learn so much about relationships between men and women (what not to do)",1106784000,6,643,4.47008547008547
8040752,5,B00069WF9E,"I am so excited that this wonderful UK series will finally be released on DVD in NTSC (Region 1) format!!!! I have been waiting for many years, and thanks to Warner Home Video it finally will be soon!!! I would like to see more Britcoms released on DVD in the US, such as: ""My Family"", ""Joking Apart"", ""No Place Like Home"", ""Take A Letter Mr. Jones"", ""The Detectives"", ""Alas Smith & Jones"", just to name a few. I find it odd that many more American series are released on DVD in the UK, than we can get their shows in NTSC format.",1101513600,4,530,4.205882352941177
