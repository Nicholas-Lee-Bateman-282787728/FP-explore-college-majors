3775081,5,B001RE1X36,"I am so glad a believer has taken the time to expose what yoga truly is and how it has dangerously slipped into the mainstream church unawares.  Bravo, faithful servant, for doing this important work for the Kingdom and the brethren.  Satan's schemes are  dashed once again!  Praise Him for it! I've given this to many believers caught up in the yoga snare and they all have been VERY receptive and thankful...they did not know they were involved in such wickedness.",1318723200,3,466,4.716049382716049
3775082,4,B001RE1X36,"Many Eastern religions place great stress on the notion of ""tat tvam asi"": thou art that. The implication of that phrase is that everything that an individual sees or experiences is you and is one. And yoga is one vital tool that Hinduism offers for a person to discover his oneness with the universe. Thus, this indirectly denies the laws of logic (A is A and not Non-A), yet a person must employ logic in that denial; thus this doctrine is self-refuting and a person who aims for this oneness in yoga is behaving irrationally.

Yoga instructors promise joy, peace, wellness, and enlightenment to those who undertake its practice. However it is really grounded on the veneration of false gods and dark spirits that can lead the practitioner to distress and ruin. And Caryl Matrisciana in ""Yoga Uncoiled"" offer a Christian critique of yoga and Eastern religious practices as the true origins and goals of yoga are exposed.

Yoga is define in the Dictionary: Sanskrit, literally, yoking, from yunakti he yokes; akin to Latin jungere to join - more at YOKE

1) a Hindu theistic philosophy teaching the suppression of all activity of body, mind, and will in order that the self may realize its distinction from them and attain liberation

2) a system of exercises for attaining bodily or mental control and well-being. yo*gic /-gik/ adjective, often capitalized.

Wikipedia defines yoga:
The word ""yoga"" derives from the Sanskrit root yuj (""to yoke""); which is cognate to modern English ""yoke"", ""jugal"" and ""jugum"" in Latin. All derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *yeug - meaning ""to join"" or ""unite"". It is generally translated as ""union of the individual atma, loosely translated to mean soul, with Paramatma, the universal soul."" [11]

Hinduism is one of the most ancient religions of man. Its sacred writings are called the Vedas. The doctrine of soul-transmigration is an important teaching in the Vedas: upon death, living things are reborn into different organisms. After one dies, one's new earth-suit is a result of how good or evil you were in your past lives. Your past deeds dispense you on the correct spot on the karmic cycle through the law of karma. You could in your next life end up a snail, a germ, weed or a man. Hinduism asserts that the One is the true, ultimate, and final reality. The particulars in our experience are illusionary (maya) and false. For a person to reach this he needs yoga and meditation. The oneness of the real is all there really is. Yet, without a ground that places equal ultimacy on both the one and many, the true God revealed in the Bible, one lacks an intelligible worldview and is on his way to spiritual devastation. The biblical God accounts for human experience, not Hindu dogma. Jesus saves, not yoga.

So Hindu thought stresses the oneness (unity) over the many (diversity). The notion that all is one is called monism and attempts to remove the Creator and creation distinction. This is linked to pantheism: the idea that all is God. If this notion is played out it requires everything to be an illusion and to be enlightened one is fused into the oneness as you realize that everything else is a mirage. This is self-nullifying inasmuch as the dogma that everything is an illusion, would thus be an illusion, hence it is fallacious.

This DVD will educate Christians concerning the history and beliefs of yoga and you discover that it is irreconcilable to Christianity and the Gospel of God through Jesus Christ.

3775083,4,B001RE1X36,"The narrator, Christian author and video producer, Caryl Matrisciana, is well-versed in the philosophy and mysticism of India, and in its essential spiritual practice: yoga. Through interviews, historical background, and quotations from various sources, the video conclusively shows that yoga is a Hindu practice through and through. There is no yoga without Hinduism and no Hinduism without yoga. Moreover, Hinduism and Christianity are entirely different worldviews. Therefore, it is impossible to Christianize yoga and Christians should not participate in it.

The video gives ample opportunity for a proponent of Christianized yoga to make her point (too much time, in fact), but her words ring hollow. The combined testimonies of experts and former parishioners of yoga is overwhelmingly against the claim that yoga is a merely physical exercise which can be practiced without spiritual involvement, which can include demonic oppression or worse.

On the down side, the video is somewhat repetitious and a bit too long (80 minutes). It also makes some claims about premillennial eschatology that are not necessary to its central thesis. Near the end the films shows book covers by Rick Warren and Richard Foster to the effect that they promote yoga. However, no citations from their writings are given to make that point. I am a fan of neither author, but some evidence for their endorsement of yoga seems needed in the film.

There are a few other difficulties One gets the impression that all of Hinduism if pantheistic, when, in fact, there are various schools of Hindu philosophy besides pantheism. True, pantheism is the school that has influenced the West most powerfully, but it is not the only approach Hinduism takes. The religion is vary diverse in its worldview, although all Hindus affirm: reincarnation/karma, maya, nirvana, the author of the Vedas, and yoga. One expert says that Hinduism (taken as pantheism) is relativistic and subjective. This is false: it makes absolute truth claims about Brahman as the supreme reality and self (Atman) as one with Brahman.

Overall, this film can help people become more informed on the history and philosophy of yoga, it incompatibility with Christianity, and the basic Christian message of salvation through the grace of God shown in Jesus Christ alone. But given some of its inaccuracies (and simply the medium of video) it is not the best scholarly source on Hinduism/yoga.",1255651200,17,2436,5.270618556701031
3775084,5,B001RE1X36,"Peace,

The Beetles & Woodstock are before my time; therefore I was never fully informed on the origin or Yoga and its introduction to The West.  I have practiced Yoga intermittently for over 15yrs, and am shocked, shook, yet happy that the truth was revealed to me thru this DVD ""Yoga Uncoiled from East to West"".

Alot of people will not be able to handle the truth which will keep them in a state & life of literally playing with fire. Serpents/Snakes in the Bible are taught to represent Satan/Evils.  If you're told & shown with facts that Yoga/Kundalini releases the power of the god of the serpent, and all of yoga's roots derives from the serpent, would you continue to open yourself to this?  When you chant the mother of all mantra's ""ohm"" you are actually calling on a deity not of GOD.

""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools...Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator..."" (Romans 1:22, 25)

""Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.) (Proverbs 3:5-6)

""So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in hid brother's way."" (Romans 14:12-13)

8337819,5,B001RE1X36,"This is the awkward moment where Christian fundamentalists and Hindu fundamentalists find themselves in agreement - ""Yoga is inherently Hindu and any Christian practicing it is acculturating himself or herself into a non-Christian mindset."" If this is true and this documentary will try to claim that it is, then you know why Christians shouldn't be practicing yoga. But why wouldn't Hindus want Christians to practice Yoga? Because they are afraid that the benefits of Yoga might get digested into the Christian paradigm, just like the Winter Solstice festival was digested into Christmas. Everyone likes to celebrate Christmas. No one celebrates the Winter Solstice festival which it was originally based upon. So Christians worry about the corruption of Christianity, while Hindus worry about the digestion of Hinduism.

Coming from a Hindu background, I can honestly say that this is not a mere Hindu hating smear documentary. The person who made it has lived in India for a really long time and is intelligently denouncing Hinduism. And at least in this DVD, the denunciation is for purely theological reasons. She does not say for instance that Hinduism is wrong because it causes suffering in the world, though she probably believes that. She says Hinduism is wrong because it is fundamentally different from Christianity. It is. No matter how close Hindus and Christians get to each other as people, they can never reconcile their ideologies.

8337826,3,B001RE1X36,"I got this video used for $20 including shipping; the price seems to fluctuate pretty wildly on this item.

I was mainly interested in seeing what sort of rationale Evangelicals might put forth in opposition to yoga.  The video comes from a very generic, evangelical, ""biblical"" perspective; the problem with this is that there is very little consensus amongst evangelicals as to what the ""bible"" really, specifically teaches.  According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC) at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, there are approximately 41,000 Christian denominations and organizations in the world!  This all from that one compilation of books known as ""the bible!""  Evangelicals strongly disagree about the nature of Jesus, about what the gospel is, about ""end times,"" about the nature of salvation, and many, many other ideas.  Basically, evangelicals dispute every major doctrine of this compilation that they all declare is ""the Word of God!""  Amazing!  So, evangelicalism and ""the"" gospel"" are definitely not the neat little package presented herein.

Yoga and ""Hinduism"" are lumped together and painted over with a very broad brushstroke;  there are a number of over-generalizations and a few outright mis-characterizations.  It was a nice touch of fairness to interview a Christian yoga teacher and get her perspective.

That aside, there seems to be a deep underlying fear in this piece regarding ""yoga proselytizing,"" probably reflective of the fact that evangelicalism is based in proselytizing, i.e., convincing others to believe ""the truth"" as a basis of salvation.  No genuine yoga practitioner will try to ""proselytize"" or convince someone else to believe anything.  Yoga is not about belief and it is not about getting people to ""join.""  Yoga is about practice and the experiences that result from that practice.  Yoga does not come from reading books and committing yourself to a belief or set of beliefs.  Many yoga masters actually discourage people from undertaking the practice to sift out those with improper motives,

Why are self-realization and self-development so scorned and condemned in this docu-drama?  To be sure yoga does teach the practitioner to tap into metaphysical energy; this is as natural as plants growing and rain falling; it is simply a process of becoming more yourself.  If God created us why would it be sinful to become more of that which truly are?
