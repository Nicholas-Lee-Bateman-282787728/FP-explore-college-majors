2307105,5,B0009OOA3K,"Anyone familiar with TaeBo and Billy Blanks knows that together equals PAIN and SWEAT.  TaeBo is for people that understand you must sweat to burn fat and calories.  This DVD helps you do just that.  Billy Blanks has targeted in-directly on the problem areas once again.  Before I started using TaeBo as a workout strategy I was wore a size 12.  I am now a size 8 and even the 8's are loose.  So I'm very pleased with Billy's AB Bootcamp DVD and all the others that I have.  Any of his cardio targeted dvd's I will also highly recommend.  Billy's AB Bootcamp DVD is the ABsolute answer to a trimmer waist and stronger abs.

It's a way to have a six-pack even if you don't drink.

2307106,5,B0009OOA3K,"I love it! 30 min of AB defining exercises! Billy doesn't break your back or neck! He walks you through the exercises and shows different or modified performances. Whether you are experienced or not this is an awesome workout!

Personally I FELT and SAW a difference after the 1st time! I love it! I llook forward to my AB workout!",1144972800,8,331,4.516666666666667
2307107,5,B0009OOA3K,"I have done my share of Ab videos and most of them are fun and challenging but show no results. After the very first time I used Billy Blanks' Ab Bootcamp, my obliques were sore and were very hard my abs began to show and I was totally encouraged. I would recommend this video to anyone. I think beginners could easily follow along although it may be a little challenging. And it is still extremely challenging for even the most dedicated exercisers. I love this video and I plan to buy many more of Billy Blanks' products!",1139616000,16,523,4.402061855670103
2307108,5,B0009OOA3K,"I've been doing Taebo for a long time and normally hate his ab stuff.  In other videos that I own, I feel like his ab work gets a little out of control when he has you pick up the pace.  Not to mention, Billy can be a little uneven in his counting.  This workout is completely different.  It's a slower paced workout that makes you focus on what you're doing.  Even though it doesn't have a cardio element to it, I still manage to sweat because you're so focused on the moves it takes a lot of strenght and concentration.  Of all the ab workouts I've done, this is the best so far.",1138752000,8,581,4.097345132743363
2307109,5,B0009OOA3K,"This is the only ab workout I have ever done, and believe me, I have done alot, where I have actually seen results.  The floor excercises are intermediate to difficult.  Billy does alot of crunch-like exercises in which you must tuck your chin to your chest and keep your shoulders off of the floor.  In other words, you must always keep your abs contracted.  I never knew it, but this is the secret to getting great abs.

Further, after doing this workout for several months, I can actually see the muscles in my stomach.  I can't believe I may actually one day have a visible six pack.  I never thought it possible.

Another thing I like about this workout is there is about 15 mintues of stand up ab excercises.  These exercises consist of alot of twisting, which slims your waste.  My waste has gone down one whole size from doing these on a regular basis.  Besides the twisting, Billy also does some stand-up ab strenghening excercises which are not as hard on your back as the floor exercises.  If you are a beginner you will find this workout challenging, especially the floor exercises.  But don't give up.  Each time you do this workout you will definitely notice that you have stronger abs and after a month of doing this workout on a regular basis you will definitely see results!!

This is by far the best and most effective ab workout I have ever done.",1136592000,46,1365,4.514285714285714
2307110,5,B0009OOA3K,"Ab BootCamp is part of Billy Blanks's newest (circa 2005) Tae Bo series, Billy's BootCamp.  I've been a Tae Bo fan for about two years now, and own many of his early DVDs, including the original 4-pack, Tae Bo II: Get Ripped (still my favorite), Ultimate Abs/Butt, and Ultimate Upper/Lower Body.  While I love the early stuff, the Tae Bo workouts that he's produced since switching studios (from Ventura Distribution to Good Times Entertainment) seem more stylish, but considerably less difficult, than his earlier work.  I was especially disappointed with Tae Bo Cardio and the Tae Bo Capture the Power series.  However, I found myself growing bored with what I had, so I bit the bullet and bought the Tae Bo BootCamp series.  I'm happy to say that I don't regret my decision one bit!

Unlike the other BootCamp workouts, the Ab BootCamp does not require the ""Billy Bands"" (a pair of elastic bands that loop around your feet and hands, thus adding considerable - almost impossible - resistance to your workout).  Thus, you can purchase this one DVD on its own and not have to worry about buying extra equipment.

The workout runs about 35 minutes in length - and boy, oh boy, what a butt-kicking 35 minutes it is!  As always, Billy starts out with some stretching and warm-ups.  Next up are calisthenics, including a series of squats with pelvic thrusts that I've never seen in Tae Bo before.  The class also spends a good amount of time in horse stance (squatting, butts thrust towards the floor), arms up, torsos twisting from side to side.  This REALLY allows you to concentrate on your abs and work the waist.  Billy has introduced this particular exercise in many previous workouts, but never in this much depth or for such a long period.  You can really feel your abs and legs working here.  Finally, it's down to the floor for a series of crunches and similar ab exercises.  Thankfully, Billy mixes it up a bit and allocates some time for stretching, which definitely takes the edge off the more extreme ab work.

I've only done Ab BootCamp about five times now, but I already notice a difference in my abs.  I'm adding this one to my regular rotation, no doubt.  Since it's also slightly shorter than many of the other DVDs I own (by 15 to 20 minutes), it's good for those mornings when you're running a little late but still want to squeeze a decent workout in.  A must for anyone who wants to work their abs (and who doesn't!?).  Five stars all around!",1132531200,123,2463,4.629032258064516
2307111,4,B0009OOA3K,"I purchased Billy's infomercial Bootcamp series and I love it because it is EXTREMELY challenging and it makes me feel like a buff and confident woman!  Well this abs workout reallys ""kicks your abs""  I definetely felt it when the workout was about over.  It is such a great feeling when you know you've worked something to the max, and that is just what it does.  I would recommend this dvd if this is an area you know you need to work on or even if you just want a great ab workout!",1126137600,10,484,4.172043010752688

Am in my late 30's, mother of two, and have visible abs! All because of this workout. I used to hate floor work, but now love it! I had to take the challenge and fell in love with floor work. Intimidating and hard in the beginning, but now it's like drinking water. Too easy

2307120,5,B0009OOA3K,"Just like basic bootcamp at first I struggled. Abs are my weakest area. But with that said I was able to do it. But sometimes I had to slow down and make sure the moves were done strong and correctly, just like any workout, or it isn't effective or can hurt you.  I do boot camp which does very effective ab work so doing this didn't make me very sore. So next round I need to be sure that's why and that I'm following his instructions.  Everything has changed w tai bo for me. I'm driven, more focused,  tone and trim and excited to have something I can do that isn't so hard I don't desire even trying.

2307126,5,B0009OOA3K,"I had this for many years as part of my Bootcamp collection but never used it until recently. I honestly hate workouts that are strictly Abs because although it's a trouble spot,I like to do workouts that work my whole body at once. I also hate many Abs excercises ,as they seem to strain my neck or back. I did this for the first time,being too tired to do a full workout and I absolutely loved it! I loved the standing rotations and even the floor work was doable for me-in other Abs workouts there are always several moves that I just can't get through but I completed and loved the whole workout! I also worked up a sweat with all the twisting moves so I feel that I got in a complete workout! I recently used T25 and was highly disappointed in the Abs&core workouts on there-this was so much better-intense but easy to follow. The core moves on T25 moved way too fast and I was always at least 2 moves behind! After owning this for 10 years,I'm glad I finally tried it!",1428710400,2,974,4.27027027027027

This video is a great ab workout and I love that it combines standing ab workouts with floor work.

2307176,5,B0009OOA3K,"First of all, just so you know, this workout is about 35 minutes long.  This may not seem like a great amount of time, but when you're severely concentrating on your abs the entire time, it feels like it.  Someone else mentioned you should stretch before you do this, that's not a bad idea, but I really don't think you're going to hurt yourself if you don't.

The first time I did this, I thought I was going to die, and though I was really trying, I couldn't complete all the sets of everything (and I have been working out consistently for years!).  After a few more times of doing it, I can now keep up.  It still burns my abs like hell, but I love that because I know it's working.  Billy gives great explanations in this one about form and breathing, which he doesn't do in all of his other workouts.  It makes all the difference.

This workout will definetely help you tone that mid-section.  I have seen noticeable results after doing this for a few months and I've only been doing it once or twice week (granted, I am combining this with his other work out videos, but still).

That's my weakest place in my body and it's the first place I gain weight.  (Maybe when I get pregnant that's where all my weight will go).  But I actually felt this workout the next day.  I have mixed feelings about the length.  Most ab workouts I own are 10-15 minutes long and I couple them with either weights or cardio depending on my mood.  This one is about 30 minutes long and I think the length is what helps me get more results, but on the downside, I find myself not doing it as often because most days I don't wake up early enough to have time to do this DVD and another shorter one.  All in all it's great.

I think this is great for someone like me who has an apple shaped body. Usually what ends up happening is my arms and legs get toned easily, but my stomach stays flabby. With this video, it ends up evening out! The results were immediate!

And, for the record, Tae-Bo has been the ONLY exercise tape system I have ever been able to stick with, and I have tried many! It's really fun and motivational. Plus, Billy Blanks really goes out of his way to make sure you understand how to do the moves most safely and effectively.

2307185,5,B0009OOA3K,"I am a huge fan of Billy. I have all his DVD's. I found myself with split ab muscles & a huge flabby belly after having 2 babies within 3 years. I was a size 2 frame with a 32"" waist! I tried cardio workouts for 2 years without improvement. Doctors told me a tummy tuck was my only option for shape because my muscles were split. They told me to avoid ab exercises because I could get a hernia.
The video-
The video is divided into standing ab work & then floor work. About 2/3 is devoted to standing. I only did the standing work because I was afraid to do the floor work because of my muscles. The music is upbeat. Billy gives great instructions.
I did this video every day. I did 1/2 hr on the treadmill first then I did the standing portion of this video. I was shocked that this video made me sweat. I've never done an ab workout before that got me heated. Results= I lost 4"" on my waist.
Extra:
I disagree with prior reviews stating Billy uses bad form. I did notice some soreness initially in my back that improved as my muscles got stronger. You need to do it for awhile before giving up. As with any workout video or class you need to modify it to fit your level of fitness. I did not do the floor work on it & I still got great results. I also skipped a move where he flops his arms around like a helicopter because I did feel pulling on my back, but my husband did the move without any problems.",1208822400,18,1406,4.061151079136691
2307186,4,B0009OOA3K,"I've recently begun to climb back on the wagon and get myself into shape.  A couple of months ago, I purchased a bowflex and have already seen dramatic results.  This past week, I started running again in an effort to attack body-fat.  At this point, I'm a far cry from those high school track and field days as my legs feel like a mixture of lead and brick as a plod through my neighborhood with my dog.

Getting something to target my abs seemed like the next logical progression, and although I have no doubts this DVD will do the trick, let me share my thoughts after just one work out so that perhaps you can be better prepared.

First, I would suggest this for those who have been doing some sort of cardio work for a while.  At 35 minutes, you will not keep up if you're just setting out--even if you're in what you believe to be relatively good shape.  Stamina is the key word here, and a slim or muscular physique doesn't always equate to it.

Second, I read a few reviews first before purchasing the DVD where they said Billy starts with some warm-ups and stretches.  FALSE!  He does not.  You need to take 5-10 minutes to warm up before starting this routine, unless, of course, you're incorporating into a part of a larger routine where it's not the starting point.

Third, give yourself some space.  I have a cramped 1 bedroom condo and was able to do the exercises without moving anything.  An 8' x 8' area would be most suitable (think in terms of an office jail cell... er, cubicle).

Speaking of cramps, I could not complete several of these exercises because my abs severely cramped up.  Not the cramp-type associated with drinking too much fluids/eating, but the actual involuntary muscle contraction that isn't very pleasant feeling.  I associate this with some of the exercises I'm already doing with the Bowflex, but be forewarned.

Finally, I think the key to this exercise regime is balance.  There is a lot of one-legged thrusting which will require most of your weight to be planted on one leg.  This is another good reason why you will need to give yourself some room.  I'm pretty coordinated and was an all-star athlete in several sports back in high school, but still found some of these exercises a bit awkward the first time around.

As with most exercise programs, technique is most important, so make sure you're stable (I suggest wearing shoes--I didn't the first time and found some of the stances difficult), warmed up and have stretched prior to starting.  You may not make it through the first round if you're just starting out, but hang in there--that burning you'll be feeling in your mid-section is a good thing!",1207353600,10,2653,4.597872340425532
2307187,5,B0009OOA3K,"As a Tae Bo novice, I find this video to be outstanding. The moves are not complicated like on other videos; they are also varied, effective and specific to your abs.

Some of the moves I don't think will do anything for you at all though. I do pilates a lot so I would know when I'm working my abs.

I can certainly tell a difference in my abs the morning after every session. It feels tighter.
The backround on the video is also motivating in a way it has an american flag with nice lighting. I also find motivation from the outfits the people are wearing. Most of them are wearing camo print.

It is so effective because he combines slimming exercises--which are done standing up and involve twisting, leg raises, and contracting the abs.

2307201,2,B0009OOA3K,"I love Billy Blanks Lower Body and Ultimate Bootcamp dvds.  I tried his Ab Bootcamp, thinking it would be great too, but what a letdown.  I'm not sure why so many other reviewers liked it so much...maybe it's just me.

His favorite move is standing and rotating the torso from side to side.  I felt it in the abs a little, but he keeps going back to it OVER AND OVER and it bothered my back. Also he makes some comment that your neck will stop hurting if you just suck it up and strengthen the neck muscles.  If you are pulling on your neck and using bad form that he teaches you, you can get hurt.

Most of the video is done standing up.  He focuses more on the obliques (sides) than the rectus abdominus (front).  At first I liked the move where you rotate your hip up and bring your elbow down, isolating the obliques.  But I got bored of it after 10 minutes of the same thing.  He does crunches standing up too.  You stand in this hunched over squatting position (which I'm sure is bad for the back), put your hands behind your head, and contract your abs, pulling your head down (pulling on the neck).  I thought this was a lot of work for the rest of the body but I didn't feel it in my abs at all.  I prefer to do crunches on the floor, which uses more resistance since you're lifting the upper body against gravity.

He does have some good floor moves in there at the end that I've never seen before.  It might be worth a rental to see those.

As usual, Billy shows his lack of stretching knowledge.  His stretching routine usually involves swinging the arms like in Tai Chi...which really doesn't stretch anything.  I found it weird that he does a quad stretch and a hamstring stretch at the end of an Ab workout.  Wouldn't you expect an ab stretch?  Or a back stretch?

This video is about 30 minutes.  It might seem short, but when you're targeting only 1 muscle group, that's a long time.  I thought my abs would be twice as sore compared to another dvd I have which is 15 mins, but the only thing that's sore is my back.

This has kept my waist and abs in shape of course I also do indoor cycling 2 to 3 time a week and every now and then the occasional boot camp video from the collection.  I highly recommended the ab boot camp  for those looking to get the waist and ab area in shape. I highly recommend doing the work out on your off cardio days it works really well.
