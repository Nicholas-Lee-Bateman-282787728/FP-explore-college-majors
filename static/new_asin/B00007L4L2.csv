7977799,4,B00007L4L2,Finally got to finish this anime after so long and it was really sweet and I loved all the characters especially Hibiki-chan. ,1488931200,,126,4.7272727272727275
7977800,3,B00007L4L2,"After months of waiting, I finally got to see the end of this series. I have to admit that while I liked the ending, a few things did leave me going ""oh please... that's farfetched even for THIS anime"". The jig is finally up for Hibiki in this volume & he's forced to come clean to everyone. Understandably, everyone is pretty upset about this, especially considering that the male Hibiki's already been labeled as a pervert by so many different people. Not to worry, as a suitably happy enough ending is in order. (It's not quite what you'd expect, though.)

There were a few things that kind of had me shaking my head, though. The biggest thing was what caused the Principal to become such a man hater to begin with & Lulu's implied role in the matter. (spoilers in the comments section) Even so, this anime is decent enough to where most fans will be able to enjoy it. It's not a particularly deep series, but it's never really ever portrayed itself as such.

7977801,4,B00007L4L2,"Don't let the title steer you away from this anime. It has all the shoujo elements of manga with enough comedy to keep some guys interested. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. It also has some of the clichs of anime, namely when a girl falls down you sometimes see her underwear. Some of the older crowd may find it a little ""young"" for them but this is in no way a kiddie anime. I recommend this for older teens and adults.",1198972800,,441,4.2
7977802,5,B00007L4L2,"23-year old teacher Hibiki Amawa is in love with his own 14-year old student Fuuko Kuzuha who develops lesbian feeings for the female Hibiki. Hibiki and Fuuko are 9 years apart. Not only they are teacher and student but also they're an adult man and an underage girl. Such a forbidden romance.

When Hibiki's gender was revealed, At first Fuuko thought her feelings for Hibiki were fake. But shefinally realizes she still loves Hibiki, whether it is male or female. Hibiki is the one she loves, regardless of the gender and it was no lie.

So she rallied, staunchly defended Hibiki and convinced the students, faculty and parents to back Hibiki and oppose the school's plans of making it an all-girls school.",1116115200,2,708,4.795081967213115
7977803,5,B00007L4L2,"The DVD starts off with every lover's dream.  In the first episode Fuko saves the woman she loves, Hibiki, from a burning building.  In doing so she does give away the fact that she loves Hibiki, right in front of Akira, who loves her, and Fujio, who loves Akira.
In the hospital, Hibiki realizes, that yes, he loves Fuko, but that Fuko loves the FEMALE Hibiki.  He just can't keep living a lie, being a fake teacher.  As he changes himself back to a man, little does he know that the Vice is in another wing of the hospital, acting like a peeking tom (which is usually played by male characters) with a camera.  In the end he is exposed by the Vice-Principal as the male he is.
Now, he could of tricked them one last time but he DECIDED it was time to be honest with his students and leave.  Being the character Hibiki is, there was really no other choice.
Ba-chan brings up an interesting point which he ignores: Does being a fake teacher mean that the lessons about life he passed on to the students was also fake?
The whole last episode deals with the events after he is exposed.  A WHOLE episode dealing with the end of a series which had only 12 episodes.  By the 13th most series are just starting to warm up, but Strawberry Eggs is ending on a high note.  A powerful little series.
That is the best part about the ending, is that it feels so powerful and so perfect for the characters.  Hibiki has to leave, but promises to return.  Fuko still loves him and you get the impression she will wait for him.  The other students have developed bonds of trust, friendship and, yes, even love.  The school's students, and their parents, have decided to keep the school co-ed, against the wishes of the Principal and Vice-Principal.  And we learn something about Ba-chan.
Many people may wish for a stronger ending, some kind of closure, but this is the best they will get.  Maybe not a happy, happy, joy, joy ending, but it is a good ending.  A solid ending.  An ending that suggests the characters will live on, grow, change and find happiness.  It even suggests hope (with a little help from Ba-chan) for the Principal!",1058832000,8,2122,4.425257731958763
7977804,5,B00007L4L2,"Yes, sadly, this is the last DVD of the series. Although it is a very short series (13 Episodes, 4 DVDs), it is an extremely well produced one. Some people have said that the ending is not very good; however, I think the ending is remarkable! Just because it's not a happy, everybody wins and flowers sprout up everywhere type ending, does not make it bad. The last episode is VERY powerful and moving. The entire espisode is wrought with compelling emotion that sucks you into the story dramatically. And, to tell the truth, I think the ending of the series is perfect! A great way to convey loss, sadness, happiness, and hope all in one end. Also, there is a jaw-dropping suprise hinted at in the ending that I don't want to spoil ;)
So if you're a fan of Strawberry Eggs, then grab this session as fast as you can. If you're wondering about the series, I highly recommend it as a wonderful look into the world of anime.",1043798400,5,922,4.39766081871345
7977805,3,B00007L4L2,"This is the last volume of Strawberry Eggs! Yes,some may think 'Aw man,its short!' well,thats what you get with a rushed series as Strawberry Eggs....a lot of people are unhappy with the ending and this story is bashed with horrible reviews(with more reasons than that)...which is making me sort of worried on getting this one. But the excitement of wondering what happens might be your doom or your relief! Maybe you will be happy with the ending. Dont blame me when you read this review and say it was good,it matters who you were rooting for to get matched up with that decides if you liked it or not. Me,I've liked Hibiki/Fuko and Fukae/Akira. The last volume(Volume 3) made me so sad....~_~ Anyway I've been hearing '....the cool guy does not get the girl. The main character does not end up with the man of her dreams',urm. I cant say if it will be good. BUT GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!I know I will ^_~
So all and all,Strawberry Eggs' ending is something I want to see,so don't be scared to pick up the next volume! I hope you enjoy the ending as much as I hope I will ^_^",1041465600,3,1073,4.37
