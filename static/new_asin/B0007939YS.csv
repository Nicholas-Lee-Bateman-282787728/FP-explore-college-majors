8046177,5,B0007939YS,Love Dean O'Gorman.  So it gets a five star.,1435449600,,44,3.888888888888889
8046178,5,B0007939YS,"I pretty much just bought this movie because it has Dean O'Gorman, Jed Brophy, and William Kircher, who are all in ""The Hobbit"".  I was surprised by how good it actually is.  It's meant to be a sequel to the book ""Treasure Island,"" set fifteen years later.  As far as sequels go, especially sequels that are not from the original author, it fits pretty well and is an interesting continuation of the story.  The acting is pretty good throughout, at least for the adult actors, though the music can be distracting from the storyline at times.  All in all, I really liked ""The Return to Treasure Island"" and am glad I gave it a try.",1423872000,,630,4.443478260869565
8046179,4,B0007939YS,"It's one of those movies that seemed like a good idea at the time, then you proceed to purchase it, wonder where your sanity went while watching it but in the end you still enjoyed it. The cheesy bit is mainly the music but overall it is a wonderful movie that I go watch when I want a good, simple story about pirates and for when I need something to cheer me up.",1364774400,2,364,4.0
8046180,5,B0007939YS,"I found out about this movie when I was doing some research into The Hobbit movie (Jim, Captain Savage, and one of Jim's crew members play three of the dwarves in The Hobbit); and because I am a huge fan of Treasure Island, I decided to check it out.  Although the music in the movie was often used at odd times, I greatly enjoyed it.  It was a fun, swashbuckling story with sea chases and battles.  It was interesting to see Long John Silver as both a loving father and a grieving husband while still getting up to his old tricks, and the love story with Jim and Silver's daughter was interesting.  The movie also does a great job dealing with the concept of slavery because it deals with it in an accurate, heartfelt way.  If you are looking for a fun pirate movie with a good historical message, try Return to Treasure Island.  You won't be disapointed.",1357516800,4,856,4.386075949367089
