8321879,5,B001MUOQIO,Our grandchildren loved the first series and have requested the second and third. How to get it from New Zealand to West Africa is the problem as the post is not reliable. I was hoping that Amazon UK or Amazon.com might have picked up this excellent series which is a New Zealand one not Australian as you might think. Anyone who has watched Flight of the Conchords will know we do not like to be confused!,1362960000,,406,4.355263157894737
