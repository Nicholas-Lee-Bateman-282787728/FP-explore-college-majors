4898473,5,B005W2BWMG,I saw Sekirei the first season and fell in love with the series. It shocked me a little at first with how much fan service was in it but it was more surprising to see an anime that came with fan service and actually still had an enjoyable story to it. I can not wait to have this added to my collection of anime that I already got,1320537600,31,330,3.8676470588235294
4898474,5,B005W2BWMG,ABOUT TIME FOR THIS anime to come out i cant wait for this video im buying this product without seeing it first! I saw it and it was GGGGGGOOOOOODDDDDDD !!!!!!!!!!!the plot is as good as the first one and this worth buying just for the ova's alone.,1320105600,9,248,4.297872340425532
4898475,4,B005W2BWMG,Shows some definate use but works. Two things that botherd me abit was the fact that the case was chipped/ cracked and the package was slightly opend. Probly should of bought new but its works for now.,1438214400,,201,4.45945945945946
4898476,5,B005W2BWMG,"I have a freely downloaded subbed version off the internet; similar story BUT the English dub's exact language varies a lot from that sub's.  I do not have great hearing but those dubbed voices seem like season 1 and their sentence structure sounds correct; unlike other anime dubs and subs where some non-native English speaker is talking and mixing up sentence structure; saying wrong words, like them instead of then and vice versa.  Those subbed versions abound in these errors, not this version (I have not read this subbed  version, just listened to the voice version). After several years of viewing  that poor subbed version this is refreshing.  This
apparently  BRAND NEW sealed set was a good buy making viewing PE a pleasure, not a chore. Some shows, both anime and live, will show different scenes on full release vs regular general audience release... that is the case here: many fan-service scenes are redone and thru out the video the dialogue is changed here and there.  The story is the same just some of it is different/better.

Another issue, never discussed but seen clearly here and even in the OVA's, is the committee decided single teat size and shape: all the Sekirei's have a wide genetic variations: blonds with blue eyes, red heads, brunet and black haired girls of various heights and builds; even some dark and tan skinned ones in the mix.  One scene shows 3 girls nude in the bath WHILE their breasts are very slightly different sizes their teats all appear identical: same size, shape and color; as if some committee decided that one teat shape was all their animators should use; too hard to draw special ones for each girl (not likely - they all have individual costumes, faces, hair and height)??  This issue is present in many R/X-rated anime where many girls are topless.  Just my own idiosyncrasy and want for realism.

  Be aware PE Disk 3  is really disk 0 and that OVA's time line is between Season-1 and PE-1; I suggest  first viewing it right after Season 1 to keep the context straight.

This OVA is the same as another version which I had purchased thinking it was just the first season alone; that ""Complete"" one also has 2 ""OVA""s including the one in this version; some OVA's are left out episodes from the regular season; not with Sekirei it appears each season has it's own unique OVA and PE has it's designated fan-service OVA.

  Also did not view Blue-Ray versions but they're flawless in appearance; no scratches/cracks.  Still this is a good version and reflects the good storyline and rendering from  season 1",1437955200,,2563,4.764172335600907

4898479,5,B005W2BWMG,"Hello again reader! Welcome back to my review! here is my review for Sekirei season 2! please enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) if you didn't read my first review or just wondering what this show is about here is a recap. Minato is a guy who failed out of his college exams so one he a girl named Musubi litterly rockets into him from the sky, she kisses him and tells him that he is her new master. Musubi (the girl show on the dvd cover) is a Sekirei which is a girl who is created with super powers to fight other Sekirei's. Minato and Musubi are forced to play in a game of survival that Hiroto Minaka the creator of the Sekirei's and the biggest building in the city. Hiroto Minaka's goal of this is to the find the ultimate Sekirei he created, so he has 4 stage of his plan, Stage One (happened in season 1) is to release all 108 Sekiei's into the city, once 90% of the Sekirei's find a master Stage Two (also happened in season 1) is now fight! When a Sekirei and a master called Ashikabi find another person who has a Sekirei both must fight so only one Master/Ashikabi stands so they can continue playing the sick twisted game of survival. So now Minato along with Musubi, Kusano, Matsu,  Tsukiumi, Kazehana (all Sekirei under Minato's watch) must now fight others and stop the crazy Hiroto Minaka from forcing the Sekirei's to kill one another!

Pros: More fighting! This is a big fighting anime so there will be tons of action. More fan survice and dirty jokes, sometimes the girls in here run around in just their underwear and like other anime (if you ever watch any anime before) will beat up any guy who sees them nude except for other girls.

Cons: if you don't like fighting anime or fan service avoid this show

Big Story Con: this second season was made in 2010, right now this review is made in 2015, not trying to spoil the ending of what happenes but at the very last scene of the season 2,  crazy Hiroto Minaka starts Stage Three which is to fight 8 strongest Sekirei that Hiroto created in order to make them under their new masters control. After that nothing :( , for some reason the people in Japan who made the anime tv series just stopped makeing it, so in tv anime we never find out what happens after so you got to read the Manga to find out.

Over all: This is a good series and you should buy it!! just don't expect anything afterwards :(",1432166400,,2388,4.316964285714286

4898517,5,B005W2BWMG,"I love this series. Season 1 was excellent, season 2 is even better IMO. Just a great example of haram anime. So if you like that type of series then Sekirei is one you will want to add to your collection.

Sekirei is NOT for kids or anyone that doesn't like topless women. There is fan service a plenty throughout every episode. The animation is top notch and so is the character development. Plenty of humor also, which fills out a good story line.",1383955200,,450,4.357142857142857

4898523,5,B005W2BWMG,I knew I would like it after the first few episodes. It was hilarious. My sister and I watch anime together. After seeing all the skin and fan service I thought hmm maybe I'll watch this one by myself but it was just too funny. We both got hooked watching all that Netflix had and I think Hulu. When we ran out we came here and bought this. It did not disappoint.,1369353600,,363,4.055555555555555
4898524,5,B005W2BWMG,This is an awesome anime and I highly recommend it to all of those who are interested in a laugh and who enjoy a good story and outline.,1369094400,,136,3.892857142857143

4898530,5,B005W2BWMG,"I bought along with season one. I've been waiting for the second season ever since it was announced. Funimation has really been stepping up with all these localizations. They just keep grabbing shows one after the other.

Well the ladies are back and Minato just can catch a break with all the chaos. You gotta see it to believe it.",1366070400,,332,4.533333333333333

4898532,5,B005W2BWMG,I really liked this anime its funny and has big boobs (boobs for the win) and also a great story line,1365120000,,101,3.857142857142857
4898533,5,B005W2BWMG,"just as i said about sekirei  i was left wanting more and the way they ended this it looks as if a 3rd will come out?! the caracters are well thought out ,action is not over the top and story line is great. just waiting for 3 to come out now :)",1364688000,,244,3.6923076923076925

4898535,5,B005W2BWMG,After watching the first season on Netflix I had to continue on to the second season. It's definitely money well invested if you enjoyed the first season! When season 3 comes out ill be sure to get that as well from Amazon of course!,1364083200,,233,4.318181818181818
4898536,4,B005W2BWMG,The dvd played very well. The animation was great. Not recommended for children because of partial nudity. Would recommend watching season one first.,1363824000,,149,5.521739130434782

4898538,5,B005W2BWMG,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday, and he was more than happy with the gift! While racy in illustration and humor, there's actually a decent story throughout this series. I recommend this for the otaku in your life with an appreciation for perverted humor and a fondness for brawling busty ladies.",1363651200,,309,4.7407407407407405
4898539,5,B005W2BWMG,"I have to say that I really enjoy the Sekirei series. Season two is equally as good as the first season, possibly even slightly better since it is easier to emotionally invest in the characters. The animation and english voice work are both vivid and fun. The show is a hoot really, despite being silly and filled with an unhealthy level of fan service panty shots, naked breasts and sexual suggestiveness. Still, the fight scenes are dynamic and the characters are pure of heart and likable. Definitely a series I will re-watch, which for me is the only reason to purchase a DVD in the first place.",1362614400,,599,4.607476635514018
4898540,5,B005W2BWMG,checked other prices and it was the best of all just what i was looking for all so not many to choice from,1361664000,,106,3.652173913043478
4898541,5,B005W2BWMG,This was next World Series I really enjoyed the sense of humor and animation I give this two thumbs up for anybody who likes this type of animation,1361577600,,147,4.285714285714286
4898542,5,B005W2BWMG,I was so excited to see all of these episodes! I am not the emotional type but this anime series made me feel so much for each of the people in the story! This was the best use of my money ever! I think everyone should watch Sekirei!!! I hope they make a third season!!!!!,1361318400,,272,3.963636363636364
4898543,5,B005W2BWMG,"Continuation of character development and also identifying new fighters and further plot revelation.  The ranking system and the process of elimination are interesting.  The storyline tangents to further expound on the different characters are effective, but some are just left out until a battle happens, like their importance is insignificant.  I like that.  The storyline focuses on a fighting bracket from the bottom to the next round versus all the main players.",1360368000,,467,5.444444444444445
4898544,5,B005W2BWMG,I loved this series from the get go! Hoping and waiting for the final series to come out and to see where and how this story ends!,1359849600,,130,3.8518518518518516
4898545,5,B005W2BWMG,"I loved the first season and so far the second season hasn't disappointed me yet.

The only thing that has bothered me so far is the fact that this set unlike the first one was packaged in a DVD case instead of a blu-ray case. Call me anal but I was expecting a blu-ray case and now I can't set this next to the first season because I bought a shelf/stand specifically for blu-rays and DVDs do not fit.

Needless to say the case doesn't effect my rating or the quality of the show and is just a minor inconvenience that I believe people should know about.",1359676800,,555,4.177570093457944

4898548,5,B005W2BWMG,"You can't make a top 10 best harem series without having Sekirei: Pure Engagement as well its predecessor being on the list.
While staying true to the harem genre this series has your run-of-the mill male main character surrounded with beautiful women that are always vying for his attention. The only difference is that these women have super natural powers.
While the anime does stray from the anime by making plot changes fans of the manga will still be satisfied with this adaptation.",1358380800,,488,4.891566265060241

Although I must say that buying this season of Sekirei only makes my on-going rage toward whoever the hell makes this series burn even stronger, since they appear to be taking their sweet F***ing time to make the next one.

4898558,3,B005W2BWMG,"Hopefully you have seen season one and know what to expect from this series. You get more of the same with the over the top fan service, bulging bust lines and short skirts. However this time around we get more fights more story and more tension. Now that our hero has assembled quite the harem, you would expect for him to be less and less concerned with teams from opposing Ashikabis, however that's not quite the case. When it suits the story, previously nearly all powerful single digit Sekireis become quite vulnerable and limited in power. It is a tad annoying and disconcerting but the story doesn't stay ""down"" for long. There is one fluff episode full of fanservice and humor which is not to say it is all business otherwise but definitely more focused then the first season.",1354233600,,784,4.64748201438849
4898559,4,B005W2BWMG,"Sekirei is nothing more than fan service. The second season doesnt take itself too serious and it better becuase of it. The fight scenese are amazing, being some of my favorite out of any anime I've seen. The humor is funny, especially a scene in episode 2 involving Kusano. Funimation has had dubbing down for a while and Sekirei is no different.",1353801600,,347,4.612903225806452
4898560,5,B005W2BWMG,"Skirei is better than the typical harem anime. It's got great action, character development, and plenty of laughs. This season picks up where the 1st left off. After the fight on the bridge. Even though the competition is thinning the danger isn't. MBI has it's eyes watching Minato and his Sekirei's 24/7. Minato also gains more Sekirei's in season 2. The end of season 2 is as climactic as the 1st, and leaves plenty of room for more to come.

The animation in this series is top notch, as is the voice acting and music. If you like season 1 this season is awesome too. I accidentally bought and watched this one first, and I was able to follow it pretty well. You will enjoy it more watching it the proper way though. I recommend Sekirei to any mature anime fan. It's a lot of fun.",1350604800,2,784,4.36986301369863
4898561,5,B005W2BWMG,"The Sekirei series is a fun, entertaining Harem show with an interesting story to back up the fights.  Many questions are unanswered about the details of the plan, with the most intriguing puzzle of, where will it go from here?  Curiosity will, for me at least, keep me looking for more episodes.  Please keep 'em coming!",1350432000,,321,4.696428571428571
4898562,5,B005W2BWMG,"Season 1 got things started, and it was one of the funniest/dramatic anime's i ever saw, but season 2 countinues the story in a somewhat different sort of way, a way that has ton's of surprise's, and as before lot's of hummor, it countinues the story of Minato who one day get's cought up in one big game where many similar looking people end up in fight's, most of the characters are memorable, and season 2 has two of the most heartbreaking/intense sequnces ever put in a anime. There's not a whole lot of extra's, but there is two cool cast comentary's, and they do have the ova episode that was never offically realeasd on japanese tv, in the end, it's worth the $30 dollars you'll be spending on it, give it a watch.",1350086400,,721,4.388059701492537
4898563,5,B005W2BWMG,"Some people will probably take one look at the cover and think it's just a bunch of fan service. But just like the first season, there is so much more to it than that. The story line continues to develop as the Sekirei Plan enters its next stage, and more about Minato's family is revealed. If you liked the first season, then you're gonna love this even more.",1349222400,,360,4.3088235294117645
4898565,4,B005W2BWMG,"This was one of the few shows that I did not watch when it came out and purchased. However my first exposure to Sekirei was on Funimation's Hulu channel while searching for something interesting to watch. Mind you I had no idea that this was one of those shows that loves to expose the top half of the female characters. That being said this is a show that is probably aimed for a more mature audience but that is something you probably already knew.

The package

If you read one of my reviews you'll know I'm very pleased with the way Funimation distributes its products. about 80% of my shows from them are DVD Blu Ray combo packs because thats just the way they sell them, and whats great is their very competitive pricing. 35 dollars for a very hefty yet slender case with more cd's then you'll know what to do with. Its very enticing and that is one of the reasons I find myself wanting to buy from Funimation. The quality is great although the menu's are a bit on the bland and on the boring side but it really doesn't matter, at least they send  you to a menu... (im looking at you Gundam Unicorn)

however both you and I didn't buy or thought about buying this for the package alone. The plot itself is well..... in my opinion cannon fodder, especially in the first season. I found myself using the show as nothing more that a noise making tool, that's probably why I wasn't bothered by how much nudity is shown, You can get the idea of the plot within the first couple episodes of the first season and from there the rest really doesn't matter. That being said I can't say I didn't care about the characters or the show. No it was quite the opposite, originally I bought only the first season after the last couple episodes were no longer available on Hulu. Once I finished I found myself actually wanting more, I wanted to watch Pure Engagement, I wanted to know what happened to the cast and who else would be added into this wild situation. Even now that I have finished the two seasons I want to see a season 3. It is not high on my list of desires and even if it does come out I don't feel like ill end up spazing out like I did for other series but the show still manages to give me a warm feeling inside. Its not the best and it doesn't deserve any awards but the show has a overall positive vibe and that alone makes the plot worth it to me.

The voice acting is ok
nothing special and nothing too horrible. The voices work and outside of that I can't think of any note worthy performances. Then again you paid such a low price that getting such a decent dub just adds value.

In summary if you looking into this show be warned, this is not a show you want to show ""willy nilly,"" The plot isn't anything special and the copious amounts of nudity may make those watching wonder why you purchased it. The animation can sometimes look dated, ugly, or just bad even on Blu ray however, some how this show manages to do quite a few things right. First the price, second the positive vibe which lends itself well to background noise in your house, and thrid the overall story while not being something to write home about it manages to make you wonder and want to see the twist in the next season whether you are on season 1 or 2. Im not going to say go out and buy this, however if you're in the market to just find a new show check it out on Hulu or Funimation's channel. There are numerous places you can get an idea for what this show is about and if it is your cup of tea then you should consider paying the low entrance fee and keep it on your shelf.",1346544000,,3568,4.216691068814056

4898581,5,B005W2BWMG,"Greetings;

Hate how production companies are pushing to do this to the public. Well, not all, I suppose. Funimation, at least, from what I have noticed. Forcing us to buy the dvd/blu ray combo pack. I had for a while entertained the idea of buying this particular set-the limited edition box pack, that is, buy it with someone else. I had seen it in a local store here in town, seen that it had what appeared to be two cases in the box, which I took as meaning one was dvd and the other was blue ray. Actually, the purple/gray box is just a cardcoard sleeve thing and not a case at all. So I guess it was just as well I was willing to splurge. My normal dvd set of the first season does at least fit in the empty space though so now I have it all together which was my ultimate goal all along.

Other fun sounding sets that you will have to buy twice include Heaven's lost property, which season two is now available for pre-order, and cat planet cuties which is also a pre-order. All dvd/blu ray combo packs. Good sounding shows, fun, with lots of fan service from the sounds of them, but still. Irritating, isn't it?

Thank you and take care...",1331164800,,1147,4.252293577981652
4898582,5,B005W2BWMG,"Regular and Blu-ray copies of season 2 in one box at such a low price, how could you say no?  If you liked the first season, then you'll definitely like this one also.  This show is only for adult anime fans, because some characters are topless due to battle damage or being in their bath-house to relax from their battles.  The Topless scenes aren't frequent, but they do happen.  Suggestive content and no sex scenes.... My only complaint is the male Sekirei that the main character has.  His super human genetics make his body change to match his master's liking, so he grows a woman's chest.  It's kinda messed up, but thankfully it doesn't happen much.  The Ova has several Sekirei getting physicals and their chests measured, most of the fan service is in this extra episode.",1328745600,,781,4.656934306569343
4898583,5,B005W2BWMG,"For those that have not read the manga (myself included) I thought the story line was a good continuation from season 1.

I watched season 1 on Netflix and I am waiting for season one to be released in blu ray format.

I don't know why but I thought some of the characters were animated a little bit different from season 1 not sure if it was because I watched the blu ray discs.

Hopefully season 3 won't be a long wait.",1328659200,,421,4.109756097560975
4898584,5,B005W2BWMG,"Pure Engagement doesn't have NEARLY the same amount of nudity and is all the better for it.  The first was still great, and the clothes being bashed off every time someone was hit was part of the humor and essentially a major part of the show - no matter how silly.  I think most anime fans either love or hate Sekerei - count me in the LOVE column!! Pure Engagement certainly had the boob shots, but nothing like the first and the plot itself, entwined with the action scenes was in my opinion even better than the first season.  Can't wait for #3 now and wish it was already available!!  If you liked the first season I think you're going to love the second!!  A definite must have for anime lovers!!",1327968000,,702,4.32824427480916
4898595,1,B005W2BWMG,"First I have watched the entire second season ""Sekirei 2: Pure Engagement"" (the subtitled version) via Hulu and enjoyed the continued storyline.

What I find wrong is the blu-ray/dvd combo idea. It seems a waste of time and money as not everyone owns a blu-ray player. Perhaps Funimation would be better to offer separate format discs. It would make sense to offer both formats separately. Which would most likely generate more sales.",1327968000,4,434,5.027777777777778

4898597,5,B005W2BWMG,"We have seen season one a few times now.  Beautifully done and it has the makings of launching a dynasty if they do not screw it over like so many great series.

We are hoping season 2 comes out in English shortly.  This one is worth watching.  What more can i guy hope for? 6 girls eventually fighting for his attention trying to co-exist and at the same time battle others.  Gotta love the twins, but my personal favorite is the hacker genius.

This series has the action people beg for, the sex appeal a guy can only dream of, and the comedy side that will leave you in stitches doubled over laughing.  Now one can only guess what happens when brother meets sister on the battlefield.  Ought to make for a hot battle.

Our  only complaint?  The episodes are not long enough. They leave you begging for more. That is how addictive this series is.

Look forward to buying season 2 and 3 once they come out in English dubbed.",1327881600,,925,4.345029239766082

4898599,5,B005W2BWMG,"Just finished watching the 2nd season over the weekend and was super impressed with it on Blu-ray, looked really amazing.  The story i think continues to improve as the episodes move forward.  Minato is slowly growing up and realizing how important his relationship with each of his Sekirei is, and that they all have things to offer him and he them.  The fan service is almost stepped up a notch (Kazehana) but the story and characters make this an excellent series in my opinion.  The OVA is really funny also with 2 short tales.  Poor Benetsubasa.....Hahane is a great foil for her.",1326067200,5,585,4.696078431372549

The story line is actually quite transfixing.  So much so, we found the subtitled Pure Engagement on Funimation's website and watched that also - but at that time there was no release date for that season in the Americas.  Was so glad to find the Amazon e-mail saying it was out and of course it is already on the way.  Thank you Funimation and Amazon this set is way past due and will be very appreciated.",1325721600,3,551,4.362745098039215
4898601,4,B005W2BWMG,"I'll start with the packaging. Unfortunately, the packaging is grossly over-sized. It's double-wide box has what I assume is deemed ""collectable art"" insert box roughly the size of the DVD-Packaging the discs utilise. (Update: Another Amazon user pointed out this is a place holder spot for the Season One DVD disc set. Seeing as I won't be purchasing season one till its release on Blu-ray, this doesn't help me much.) Beside the specialised packaging, there doesn't appear to be anything else especially ""special"" about the special edition.

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the Blu-rays and DVDs are packaged in DVD packaging, rather than Blu-ray packaging, meaning that the packaging itself is larger than I had originally anticipated.

Packaging problems aside, the (Blu-ray) material is presented in fairly good 1080p with pretty decent sound and is a must-have for any fan of the series.",1325548800,2,896,5.302816901408451

4898603,4,B005W2BWMG,"Let me start by saying as expected if you have not watched the first season of this series don't even try to watch this season. That said if you did watch the first season you are most definately going to want to watch this one.

Sekirei was a bit of a surprise for me. Despie how it is advertised as yet another fan fair, panty on the brain and not much else series there is a great deal more to the show then that. Yes the curse has been broken we finally have a fan service anime with a BRAIN! Underneath all of the nudity, panties and bouncing there are likable characters with real personalities not to mention a fair story line. Yes that's right this series actually has a purpose beyond fan service! But if you watched the first season you already know this,

The second season here picks up a little while after the first and tasks off with a vengeance. A lot of the questions posed in the previous season are answered but enough is left out that they could make a third season if they so choose, it is even hinted at. Despite this there are enough loose threads tied up that you feel fine with it ending as it is.

As with the previous season the animation is excellent, blending with 3d effects for some truly eye popping fight scenes and the voice acting top notch as well. Combined this with a decent, not excellent mind you, decent storyline and Sekirei is one of those rare series that while not one of the best anime ever made is most certainly among your favorites.

In the end though the question is should I buy this season or series. Well let me be frank, it's $60 and the show is only 13 episodes long, about 5 hours. While fun, enjoyable and among my favorites that is just too high a price for me to recommend anyone to buy. I suggest waiting for the price to either drop or until they come out with a complete series box set with both seasons for the same price before buying this little gem.",1321747200,25,1915,4.267217630853994
4898604,5,B005W2BWMG,"This has all the hallmarks of this type of anime: the sexy fighting girls, the embarrassed, reluctant male hero, titanic battles, and a darling way of presenting young love.

Still, it pushes things a bit!  There is the over-arching story of a city being ruthlessly controlled by a corporate Police State; not a government, but a megacorporation that soared to power after its founder discovered a hidden technology on a remote island.

But there is another part to the story: that of the BONDS of LOVE that can cause people to reach so deeply, and call so urgently upon their strength in order to protect those bonds, that something BRAND NEW can emerge -- something wonderful!

Even the WINGED (emerged) Sekireis are subject to all the usual frailties ... jealosy, selfishness, wickedness; but the BIRDS of LOVE, as they are called, will teach and learn about love ... as ordained by the Sekirei of Fate.

As usual, the question looms: ""What will prevail? The disasters brought about by human shortcomings, or that which lies on the other side of the BONDS of LOVE? And are the Sekireis and their Masters willing participants in the GREAT GAME (The Sekirei Plan), or are they helpless pawns, subject to the whims of a power-mad meglomaniac?""

You decide; but the girls are lovely, the action is great, and the story ... well, after watching through season 2 ...

I want more!
