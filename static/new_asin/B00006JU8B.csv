1782471,5,B00006JU8B,"... Lovely and Amazing is both of those things; it has great heart, great humor and great truth about many aspects of the female existence. It deals, in large measure, with discontent about the self--physically, creatively, and interpersonally. Brenda Blethyn gives, as always, a flawless performance as a woman who, above all else, loves her daughters--despite their anger and fear and uncertainty.
What is especially appealing about the movie is its avoidance of cliched situations and characters while managing to convey in the case of the Hollywood casting/agency world, for example, the subtle horror of trying to succeed as an actor in a business that thrives on egocentricity, the misuse of power, and dishonesty. Dealing (or not, in the case of Blethyn who fantasizes about Michael Nouri, her plastic surgeon) with men is tricky territory. And in a performance worthy of his considerable talent, Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the narcissistic movie star with a hidden vein of honesty.
Our initial impression of the adult Marks women is subtly, gradually altered as their experiences in the course of the film both give and take away what they seem to want most. And, ironically, the one character who is most herself in the truest sense, is little Raven Goodwin as Annie. This child is actually lovely and amazing and she is, ultimately, the beacon of unflappable self-containment, steadily eating, and shining the laser light of her unfettered vision on everyone around her. Annie is an extraordinary creation, brought completely to life by this admirable child.
This movie will, undoubtedly, be snidely termed a ""chick flick."" Sadly, the men who've so far offered their opinions were clearly not open to the subtext of the script. Not one of the women gets what she thinks she wants, but in the end what they have is something better: each other.
A fine script, fine performances, and an entirely refreshing look at a family of females who only seem typical. Director Nicole Holofcener brought a complete banquet to the table and the vast majority of women who see this film will go away, happily replete.
Most highly recommended.",1027641600,17,2141,5.067988668555241
1782472,2,B00006JU8B,"The quintessential chick-flick, ""Lovely and Amazing"" is a warm and insightful film about feelings, family, and strained relationships.  All the men are insensitive and unable to detect the needs of the women in their lives.  All the women are tortured by insecurities about their bodies, but know themselves as creative, devoted, and nurturing.  Resting heavily on character development like only a novel can, the movie lacks any real plot.  Instead, the audience is treated to an ever deepening intimacy with the open sores that are the lives of three sisters and their mother.  Well acted.",1027123200,7,591,5.178947368421053
1782473,4,B00006JU8B,"This is a slight film though it is both entertaining and insightful. The characters are in the main familiar, postmodern self-absorbed types, all too often demonstrating to our amusement their prickly tempers under their ""non-judgmental"" surfaces when they're even slightly thwarted.  The speed with which Catherine Keener, for instance, spits out four-letter words
at those who reject her artwork is a delight to observe.
On a deeper level, the film suggests that its characters' self-absorption is chosen, but that realized personhood rests in the decision to transcend the self and do what's needed for someone else.  Happily, the scene in which Keener says the right thing to her hurting African-American stepsister is not preachy but both believable and winning. All in all, Nicole Holofcener has given us a film of contemporary life marked by verbal wit and intelligence.",1025913600,6,877,5.3478260869565215
1782474,4,B00006JU8B,"Nicole Holfcener's ""Lovely and Amazing"" is not all lovely and amazing but it certainly is pretty and unique.  I think the film's success or failure depends largely on how you perceive/like/tolerate/love/hate Catherine Keener; for she is the kingpin and the do or die of this movie.
On the negative side, Catherine Keener-wise, she has pretty much been playing the same role for the last ten years: super smart, a bit needy, marginally successful, and sometimes strident.  And she exhibits many of these traits in the role of eldest daughter Michelle Marks, daughter of Jane (Brenda Blethyn) and older sister of Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer).
On the positive side, Keener has some rare for her quiet, dramatic scenes that she handles with aplomb. These scenes mostly involve her mother and her stepsister and they are refreshing in that Keener is allowed to show her softer, vulnerable side. She also has some hilarious, loopy, smartly written and directed scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal as her erstwhile and amorous ""boyfriend.""
""Lovely and Amazing"" follows the lives and loves, the ups and the downs of the Marks women in their various quests for boyfriends, flatter tummies, fulfilling jobs, etc.
Holcener has infused the film with humor and a slightly off-center wit that carry the film along at a fast clip but she also knows how and when to slow down the pace and get serious.  There are many touching scenes such as the one between Elizabeth and Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney) in which she asks him to assess her naked body because, like most of us, she has body issues. He reacts by pointing out the mostly good as well as the not so bad.  He calls the incident ""refreshing"" and indeed it is in an astringent, gee-she's-really naked-for-three-minutes kind of way.  Heretofore, McCabe, an actor and closet good guy has been painted as a jerk but Elizabeth obviously sees something we don't and proves to be right.
""Lovely and Amazing"" is a rare breed of film: one that can make you laugh and then laugh harder. It touches not only your heart but your soul as well.",1025568000,31,2064,4.8522727272727275

This means that a good many of the characters are undergoing serious social, parenting, medical and/or marital problems while wisecracks and one-liners abound.  It's therefore difficult to decide whether or not to be amused, saddened or puzzled.

1782484,4,B00006JU8B,"Certainly, the characters in Nicole Holofcener's film have issues. Whiny and unhappy, there's a lot of angst expressed throughout. Still, the delivery of the ace cast handled the absurdity of the script quite well. The appearance of Jake Gyllenhaal lifted the proceedings quite a bit, and the overall effect was entertaining. Another film about the idiot behavior of somewhat privileged people is not new; Ms Holofcener created a new take on this behavior, and I enjoyed it a lot.

Emily Mortimer won awards and noms for her performance, and she was, indeed, lovely and amazing.",1339200000,,578,5.08421052631579
1782485,4,B00006JU8B,"Directed by Nicole Holofcener, a fairly young director making her second or third film, it may be best known for the full stand up nude scene with Emily Mortimer.  In this scene, Elizabeth (Mortimer) a struggling actress, asks that another actor who she had just slept with (played by Dermot Mulroney) to critique her body.  Quite unusual in that we the voyeur, are asked to do the same with lingering shots of her.  For me she looks just fine!

Catherine Keener is quirky and funny as Elizabeth's older sister who has an affair with a 17 year old played by Jake Gyllenhaal.  Their mother is thrown in the mix as another in the family uncomfortable with her own body.  She has adopted a crack baby who is now about 12 and has her own issues.  While not laugh-out-loud funny, the movie is certainly an amusing chick flick.  While men play a secondary and less important role, it is not suggested they are mean or scoundrels.  They don't always support the women in their lives, but the director lets the audience understand why they don't.  Fair and balanced.",1331078400,,1058,4.609625668449198
1782486,5,B00006JU8B,"We just screened this movie in film class. It is so good.  The Marks women (& girl) in this movie all struggle with insecurities feelings of inadequacy. There's one scene with Emily Mortimer that is so raw. As a woman, watching that scene, you can't help but cringe while you're imagining how exposed she must feel, emotionally and physically.  Beautifully acted and very honest account of being a woman and trying to figure it all out.",1321401600,,436,4.723684210526316
1782487,5,B00006JU8B,"""Lovely and Amazing"" is precisely that - an amazing drama about the struggles of ordinary women trying to feel better about themselves in a world that is too often harsh and cruel. Though the movie itself centers on a mother and her three daughters, their struggles are universal and can apply to men as well. The fantastic ensemble cast makes this a fine drama which had me cringing, laughing, and crying.

Brenda Blethyn plays middle-aged Jane Marks who is mother to two adult daughters, i.e. Michelle (Catherine Keener), and Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), and adoptive mother of eight-year-old Annie (Raven Goodwin). Jane appears sensible and has plenty of suggestions and advice for her two adult daughters, yet she herself suffers from insecurities about her body image and decides to have a liposuction. Michelle is a thirty-something artist who can't seem to get anyone interested in purchasing her art and flounders in her marriage. Then there is pretty Elizabeth who struggles to find acting parts whilst feeling insecure about her body (not helped by an unsympathetic boyfriend). Eight-year-old Annie finds herself trying to fit in with this adoptive family, made even more difficult by the fact that she is African-American and her adoptive family is white.

There are many real moments in this movie which are compellingly portrayed. Michelle's sense of insecurity about her marriage manifests itself by outbursts of anger and getting involved in an inappropriate relationship. Elizabeth's doubts about her talent and body image manifests itself in her penchant for bringing home stray dogs and caring for them. As for Annie, Raven Goodwin delivers a compelling performance (amazing given how young she is) as a conflicted and confused young girl who struggles to adapt and assimilate, and there's one scene involving a hair makeover that really saddened me.

The actors deliver credible performances - this is truly a movie where the female actors dominate, yet I felt the male actors though acting in secondary roles, managed to carry their own. Dermot Mulroney shines as the actor/playboy, Clark Gregg as Bill, Michelle's husband, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Jordan, the high school student who manages a photo processing store! The movie benefits from good direction and I would highly recommend this to fans of movies that explore everyday people coping with life's struggles.",1282953600,,2396,5.267015706806283
1782488,3,B00006JU8B,"It is a story of going-liposuction mother and grandmother having an eight old daughter of Afro-American background adopted to entertain herself as two biological daughters (an artist turned film technician in a shop run by seventeen year old sex-sick school pupil and an actress uncomfortable in shooting sex-scenes with strangers) struggle with their personal and financial situations.

At the end of the day the actress is paid for her heartkindness (to stray animals at least) with a dog disfigures her main asset her face is.",1253923200,,529,5.223529411764706
1782489,3,B00006JU8B,"Brenda Blethyn is in this movie.  She's one of my favorite actresses and has been since `Secrets and Lies'.  Here she's, are you ready for it, quirky!  And has two quirky adult daughters and adopted a third daughter who might out do them all in the quirky department.  These people are sad but it's hard not to like them.  I didn't understand the inclusion of pedophilia in such a comic movie.  It barely works in serious movies as `Little Children' and `Notes on Scandal'.  The light treatment of it bothered me.  By the end there did seem to be some emotional growth for all the characters as they rushed off to get mom from the hospital where she'd undergone liposuction.  Sheesh.  It's not a bad movie but it's hard to understand why it was made.  Even the title highlights some of the frothy dialog.",1239580800,,804,4.513888888888889
1782490,5,B00006JU8B,"It drives me mad to read reviews posted about this beautiful film that describe it as a chick-flick or a women's film or the most stomach-churning of them all, L.A.'s version of Sex and the City. Unbelievably narrow and blind to the universal (but uncomfortable) truths about all of us, men and women, that run through this remarkably written and performed film. Lovely and Amazing is one of my favourite films of the last 10 years because the writer and director, Nicole Holofcener is one of the very rare American directors who actually makes films about who we are and why we behave the way we do. In my opinion, she seems intensely interested in examining how human beings interact with each other and the oftentimes uncomfortable, awkward and disheartening compromises each one of us  makes every day just to keep going. This has nothing to do with one gender or the other. There is nothing in Elizabeth's (Emily Mortimer's character) narcissism and self-absorption that doesn't ring true for myself and 90% of my friends (again - men and women) who are actors, writers, artists struggling to make a name for themselves. Catherine Keener's character, Michelle, and her sense of being lost and rudderless in the world seemingly filled with others her age who are focussed and achieving so much of what they always wanted, unfortunately reminds me of myself and my inability sometimes to deal with the real world. The way the Marks' daughters relate (and don't relate) to each other and their mother is so sensitively and realistically done I can only marvel at Holofcener's courage to put the truth right up there on the screen. Near the end of the film is a scene in a McDonald's (brilliant choice) between Catherine Keener and Raven Goodwin's characters - sisters who have never really understood each other. Their tenuous connection during this scene and the heartbreaking realization of Annie Marks (Goodwin) that her real mother may have been more than just one unpleasant thing - a drug addict - that she may have been a good swimmer - something Annie so very much wants to be, makes this scene one that I go back to in my mind almost every day. This scene is a revelation because it is so exquisitely written and played and because it speaks to every single one of us watching who has ever, for the sake of making ourselves feel better about who we are, described someone else as one thing - Oh, He's an actor; Oh, She's an alcoholic; Oh, He's old; Oh, She's a college dropout; Oh, He's a bitch. Yes. Sure. Maybe he/she is. But maybe she's a good swimmer.

As well.

Bravo to Nicole Holofcener. I eagerly await her 2009 project.",1219276800,2,2639,4.720173535791757
1782491,5,B00006JU8B,"Hey, I liked this chick flick because the acting is great, the script is intelligent and the plot makes sense. The soundtrack is good. It may feature some Hollywood actors like a young Jake Gyllenhall, but the ambience is completely indie and that's a great thing in a small movie. This is better than most blockbusters. It will make you relate to the human condition.",1217808000,,368,4.676923076923077
1782492,3,B00006JU8B,"There are some good things in this film.  No 1 is the performance of Catherine Keener, who has the ability to make even the most odious of characters likable.  ('loved her in Being John Malkovich)  The next best thing is the performance of Raven Goodwin, who makes every scene she's in a delight.  (Whoever did her hair in the last scenes should have won an Oscar.)  Next:  the always adorable Jake Gyllenhaal, playing a nerdy 17 who falls for the Keener character.  (Whoever did his hair, though, should be fired...it's sooo black and shiney!)  Next:  a small part by Dermot Mulroney, resembling a young Sylvester Stallone--very cute.

The dialogue is smart.  I found the pacing quick and it held my interest.  The other actors are good enough.  There are some worthy ideas introduced.  I loved the scene with Gyllenhal and Keener in the car and later, the one with Keener and Goodwin in MacDonalds.

On the negative side:  gee--these women are so damned spoiled, self centered and highly unrealistic! We're supposed to care about them but they make it hard! The Emiy Mortimer character is about as sexy or interesting as a dishrag, and has the same amount of presence.  Who could imagine her succeeding as an actress? She should definitely get a job in an animal shelter.  The Keener character has delusions of grandeur, trying to peddle off her childish crafts as ""art"" at ridiculous prices.  When she got a job at the one-hour photo, it was the best thing she ever did, (after giving birth.)  However these girls didn't stand a chance, with the mothering given them by the smart talking (supposedly) mom who doesn't have a good word to say about any men, but wants the plastic surgeon to like her.  The answer to her problems is liposuction.

I suppose this will amuse or touch people who can identify with these people more than I could.  It seems like there's a lot of talent here that could better be used on something a little more weighty.",1179187200,2,1948,4.68141592920354
1782493,4,B00006JU8B,"Lovely and Amazing is a feminine picture (albeit still watchable for a man) and it is also a deeply depressing story that briefly peaks into the lives of two women and their mother.  It is slow and somewhat awkward but it retains it's positive side at the end with notably almost no resolution whatsoever. The film paces itself very slowly, yet somehow works well because it is written and handled with a refreshing eye.  Nicole Hilofcenter (Sex and the City) directs.

Catherine Keener plays one of the daughters, Michelle, a 36 year old unemployed mother of one young daughter.  Her husband is easy to relate to for a man and his patience as a character is exceptional because Keener's character has a highly volatile temper and she is for what it's worth completely unreasonable, yet somehow likeable at the same time.  She sees herself as an artist and we watch her fail at that and then become a clerk at a one hour photo.  There she has an affair with her 17 year old boss played by Jake Gyllenhaul.  Things unfold for her as expected and I for one feel she gets what she deserves.

Her insecure younger sister Elizabeth, played by Emily Mortimer, on the other hand is originally dealt a fair hand and ironically gets it taken away as her insecurities are realized.  She sleeps with an actor who is boorish enough to be honest about whether she is sexy or pretty enough to be an actress.  You see, her being self-centered is seen as a requirement and that actually made it more fun for me to watch her fail.  She is finished with her one night stand with this actor, and asks that he critique her body.  She stands naked in front of him in a surprising, awkward and daring (for Mortimer) sequence.  Mortimer is certainly attractive enough to watch her fully nude for this long but it's such a cold and bleak scene that really comes out of nowhere, it is certainly not meant to be sensual.  She comes as who she is, vulnerable and probably not ready to enter the world of acting.  The film is loaded with moments like this that go against the grain and ultimately help the characters get used to themselves as much as they may resist.

Their mother is in the midst of getting liposuction and the risks of surgery do indeed show themselves.  She has adopted a young African American girl which makes for some interesting comments regarding race as well as she is enrolled in a ""Big Sister"" kind of program to get exposure to another black person.  It's unfortunate that so little is said about their mother's past because she really ought to be the center of the film.  Her story and her adopted daughter's story may have been intended to be delved into further...perhaps some was left on the cutting room floor.

All of the characters' fits of selfish vanity are always answered.  That seems to be the running theme and it gives you a different outlook on these things despite these characters being fundamentally good people. Is it really so wrong to ignore or displace blame for your own vanity so easily? If so, isn't it society that is doing it to us or should we be accountable for it?  Do we create our surrounding culture enough to pay the price for being ingrained within it's sins?  Is there anything we can do about it?  I know one thing, my latest job interview may go a hell of a lot better if I comb my hair and where a really nice suit then if I don't.  Then again just like anything, vanity has it's excesses.  Just as Lovely and Amazing finishes it's value in helping us ask interesting questions, it ends as unconventionally as it unfolds.  It's no classic, but it is films like this that if other filmmakers take note it can certainly provide different avenues for expression.",1178841600,7,3699,4.531626506024097
1782494,5,B00006JU8B,"When I watched her film Walking and Talking, at the Angelika Film Center in New York, almost 10 years ago, I was totally impressed with the simplicity of the story and the perfect tone. Nicole Holofcener is definitively one of my favourite directors. I am a film producer, and I would love to produce a film directed by her. As simple as that. Here, with Lovely & Amazing, she did it again. It's just perfect. The film has a wonderful balance, a subtle pace, a connection with reality that is quite unusual and difficult to find. Her characters don't talk all the time, but they listen, and so do we, the audience. Lovely & Amazing is a film that totally meets its name: it is absolutely lovely and amazing to watch.",1156464000,3,716,4.473282442748092
1782495,4,B00006JU8B,this movie was great. about real life everyday troubles that add up and ones that we don't always notice.,1155859200,,105,4.578947368421052
1782496,4,B00006JU8B,"This is a tale about multiple insecurities. There's a mother who's insecure about her body and so goes for liposuction. There's her married daughter who's insecure about a whole lot of things. There's her single daughter who's insecure about her looks because she's an actress, or trying to be, and is not sure is she's sexy enough. And there's her adopted daughter--an 8-year old black girl--who's insecure about the way she looks also.

This whole nest of insecurities gets these folks into a bunch of wacky situations. The dialogue here is smart and sharp and natural, and that's a really good thing, and so we do get a chance to dig into these characters' psyches. At the same time, even though things don't always turn out for the better along the way, making the film more 'realistic', there's something missing here.

It feels like a kind of forced realism, as though the situations, or at least a couple of them, happen the way they do to let the audience know that, guess what, things DON'T always turn out the way we hope they will. We know they don't; it's just ever so slightly cringe-producing to see a film where you sort of feel like the filmmaker is bending over backwards to show this. True, more of the situations do feel natural than these forced ones. But the forcing does come through, unfortunately, and gets in the way of what could have been a superior effort.

Overall this is not a bad film at all. The married daughter wants to be an artist and some of her work is fairly good, but the situation of nobody thinking so in a commercial establishment brings her down, understandably. Her unsympathetic husband tells her to get a job and she does, working at a one-hour photo shop. Complications ensue.

Complications also ensue when the mother goes in for liposuction and the single daughter auditions for a part in a film and the adopted daughter, willful to the max, does all kinds of things without telling anybody. This was a tough call, choosing between 3 and 4 stars. I gave it 4 because the acting is top notch and the writing is more often than not also great.

Some snags, but definitely worth a look.",1145491200,2,2134,4.605263157894737
1782497,1,B00006JU8B,"Nicole Holofcener (and I thought I had a tough-to-pronounce last name!) directed several episodes of Sex & the City, a show that I love. But ""Lovely and Amazing"" is one of the worst films I have yet to see.

Worst of all, it has exstremely annoying characters that I felt nothing for. The two sisters, Keener's (especially) and Mortimer's characters, are so unbelievably annoying and whiny I in fact did not sympathize with them, but with their poor husbands/boyfriends!  My feet were curling up in embarassment, and unfortunately, there are many many women like that out there. Oh, did I mention that I'm a woman?  That doesn't mean I can't see things from both a male and female perspective - it's called being ""intelligent""!  :>)

Jake Gyllenhall is the only ray of sunshine in this film (the reason why the film gets its one star from me): you can't your eyes off him: adorable in a off-beat way, you never get the sense he's acting, whereas everyone else in the film seems terribly self-conscious and obviously very ""aware"" of the camera. He and Maggie Gyllenhall (his sister) give me great hope for American film! Can't wait to see him in ""Brokeback Mountain"", getting it on with Heath-sensitive-stud-Ledger. (by the way: I found it hard to suspend my disbelief in the Gyllenhall/Keener love affair case. He's under his ""scary-dumpy- -bathrobe"" mom's thumb and is perhaps looking for another mom figure and is attracted to Keener's older woman character? Jake made me want to believe, but in real life, I doubt if a cutie like him would fall for a Keener bore!)

Raven Goodwin is good: she plays the adopted overweight (okay, fat!) smart, black 8-year old daughter of the Keener/Mortimer sisters' mother (a decent performance by Blethyn): the film would have worked very well if consistently viewed from her perspective: ""black kid in a neurotic white family POV"" (and you thought you had problems!).

Oh, and is it any wonder that husbands are cheating on their wives, when these wives look and talk like Keener?  Why do women stop caring about themselves, their looks, their clothes when they get married and have kids?  Look good for yourself, so YOU can feel good!  And if hubby stops caring about himself, well, then send him packing or screw around yourself!  (not good if you have kids I should add - they shouldn't pay the price for their parents' screwed up lives).

Summa summarum:  one big yaaaawwwwwn of a film!  Stick with Sex and the City!  Yes, the SATC women have problems, but the SATC writing and acting was utterly superb, which is why not even Nicole H. could mess it up!

And finally: why, oh why are there so few female directors in the US?  Are there no women graduating film school?  Are they all doing earnest documentaries or Pamper commercials?  What's up with that?

After all, even an Indie production costs millions to produce.  Your average middle classer has a hard time comprehending his rent, forget getting a picture funded.

In Lovely and Amazing, the women seemed to live in a plush world of decorator pillows and jeans.  Big houses or snazzy apartments are the norm, trendy villages to shop too. Emily the Actress, she's not waiting tables while she is in between lovers or parts. Nor is her older sister, ex-prom queen , Catherine in the work world after college and kids.  Her hubby has his semi-glamorous office world and mistress, and plenty of time away from the family.  The cars are smooth and leathery without pretention, the clubbiness and veranda angst is so Bloomingdale.

I don't want to repeat too many reviewers, so I'll keep this brief and say that most people who are accustomed to pondering their self-worth will get a lot out of this film. You'll likely see a bit of yourself in each character.

Also, the adopted daughter Annie is reason enough to give this film a shot. This overweight but darling girl really brought a lot of life to the story.

All in all, I don't think you're supposed to love all of these characters. Most everyone in the story has a significant, debilitating issue, but you've just got to experience what they go through--it can be really meaningful to your own life.",1111449600,2,679,4.512195121951219
1782502,3,B00006JU8B,"The mix and remix of sound for this DVD is so bad I suggest you turn on the subtitles so you can follow the dialog more easily.  Excellent male actors are given little or nothing to do.  Given these faults and the lack of any real movement in the characters, there is a lot that is excellent.  There is close observation of details in how we talk to each other, much of which is very funny.  Catherine Keener once again shows how excellent an actor she is, inhabiting her character so completely and naturally she saves the movie.  Her examples of ""fake"" and real smiles are terrific to watch, as is her panic being at a party where she is a nobody.  In a way this movie is part insider ""Hollywood "" joke and part essay on female insecurities.

The director has inserted a subplot about an adopted sister that is good by itself but not really needed as part of the flow and it detracts from the overall effect.

Rent it for Keener, otherwise as an example of a project that did not quite make it.. And also as an example of how important sound is to get right.",1109808000,5,1060,4.265
1782503,3,B00006JU8B,"I'll be honest. I got this movie because I saw Jake Gyllenhaal's name on the cover and as a huge fan of his work, I thought I would give this movie a look. I'm kind of sorry I even bothered to look. This movie is drab and dull and drags along with not a whole lot happening and when something does nobody seems to make a big deal out of it, yet I get the feeling they want you to make a big deal out of it.

Michelle is a housewife, bored, and spending her time making useless miniature, ugly chairs and painting handmade wrapping paper that she wants to sell at an outrageous price. She's not a bad artist, but she should get in line-- there are lots of starving artists and you can't start out on top. Elizabeth is her sister, a neurotic actress who doesn't like herself. Michelle doesn't like herself either. And what do you know, their mother goes in for liposuction in the beginning of the movie because she doesn't like herself either. These three women manage to drag the young, adopted sister named Annie into their completely neurotic lives as well.

The dialouge is witty at times and Dermot Mulroney swooops in and saves this movie a little bit. Even Gyllenhaal (who is hardly in the movie at all) saves the flick as well, creating some necessary action. But I get the feeling I've seen this Gyllenhaal character before... (could it be a less depressing version of the kid he plays in The Good Girl??!!) Without a doubt though, the character Annie is the saving grace in this movie, providing some necessary laughs and great insight for such a young girl. Aside from Dermot and Jake, she's the real reason to watch this movie.

The film wrapped way to quickly for me without much resolution for any of the characters-- well, except for the mother. This could have been a better movie, but hey-- it is what it is. A humdrum, dull, kinda witty, kinda cute in spots, little bit weird movie. Check it out sometime when you're not sure what you want to watch. When it's over, I'm sure you'll have a whole list of excellent films in your mind that you'll want to follow this one up with.",1100563200,4,2092,4.414507772020725

Perhaps ""Lovely and Amazing"" is best suited for the ladies, as no men make an impact of any measure.  Great acting and lots of potential but the film really doesn't go anywhere.

1782505,5,B00006JU8B,"Lovely & Amazing surprised me at the sheer content of sociological examination.  Nearly every scene exposes a glimpse at unspoken, or rather rarely-spoken, idiosyncracies in everyday interaction.
For example, the adopted girl, Annie, shows white viewers that even at her young age she must confront such topics as: straightening her hair, being told her ""mother"" (older black woman who is a mentor) must wear a swimming cap in the pool while the white swimmers do not; being told she doesn't need sunscreen because her ""skin is already brown""; understanding why her adopted mother needs liposuction to look better (Annie must wonder if she needs to look better also).
These are but a breach in the bundle of issues this movie examines.  Each character raises a multitude of motifs that could serve as meaningful topics for lengthy essays.  If I were a sociology professor, this movie would be required viewing in my classes.",1085529600,6,924,5.065789473684211
1782506,3,B00006JU8B,"Lovely and Amazing (Nicole Holofcener, 2001)
Nicole Holofcener (Sex and the City, Gilmore Girls, Six Feet Under) delivers her second feature film in which a lot of people do a lot of talking and no one actually does much of anything. This one centers around a mother (Brenda Blethyn, recently seen in Little Voice) who's about to go into the hospital for liposuction, and her three daughters, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer of The Ghost and the Darkness fame), Michelle (Catherine Keener from being John Malkovich), and adopted daughter Annie (Raven Goodwin, last seen in The Station Agent). The mother and the three daughters are all variously dysfunctional. Elizabeth, an actress, has a minor part in a movie that's about to open and no other forthcoming prospects. Michelle is an artists trying to consign her handicrafts to various art stores and failing repeatedly, while her husband is off knocking boots with her best friend. Annie, transracially adopted, is just trying to fit in however she can. Let's face it, it's an Oprah Movie Club pick waiting to happen, if Oprah ever starts a movie club.
Still, it's got its good points. I rented it solely for the Jake Gyllenhaal factor, truth be told. While Gyllenhaal's entrance into the movie comes late, the boy is never less than a pleasure to watch onscreen, and he does a great deal to redeem the movie (his character is the catalyst that drives many of the few events that actually occur in the film). Dermot Mulroney, as a possible new relationship for Elizabeth, does some of his best work here since Young Guns (one wonders if, between this and The Safety of Objects, Mr. Mulroney isn't beginning to vault himself up onto the A list). The four main actresses are all very good in their roles, if not actually given much to do. Even the normally loathsome Brenda Blethyn is watchable (i.e., a bit less loathsome than usual), though she just doesn't sound right with an American accent.
The strength of the movie, however, lies in Raven Goodwin. Annie's search for some way to fit in to the mess that is this family provides most of the movie's truly absorbing moments (the relationship between Keener and Gyllenhaal providing the rest of them). The rest of the movie seems to be made with an eye towards exciting a kind of embarrassed, nervous laughter from the viewer (and it succeeds well), but most of the scenes containing Annie aim for the heart, and without the usual emotional manipulation one is apt to find in most Hollywood fare. It's a refreshing change.
If you want movies where lots of things happen, you can probably dismiss this. If you don't mind a slow pace and a lot of dysfunction, give it a look. ** ",1070496000,4,2675,4.765086206896552
1782507,5,B00006JU8B,"This is a movie of long dialogue scenes, don't expect action, it may seem slow for some people, but in fact it's a heart-warming drama.
To understand this film, keep focusing on the dialogue, it will take you deeper inside the character, which will take you even much deeper inside the story, by that time you won't feel the minutes passing by, and you'll beg if it was much longer than that.
The performance is amazing, the script is very well-written, there were no gaps, very logic, the twists and turns break the heart.
Emily Mortimer plays the role of an actress with very weak self-confidence, or weak character, she excelled in this role, her face was so innocent.
Catherine Keener is the eldest sister, a loser unemployed married woman, desperately tries to sell the things she makes.
Things always go against her well.
Brenda Blethyn is the mother who's trying to live her past despite being old.

The bad things about the movie: although the movie is well made, the narrative is more than a bit lacking dragging the pace beyond any trickle of entertainment (and I recognize this is subjective.)
That it is so real is also the movie's weakness.  One daughter stands naked before her new lover and begs a frank assessment, good and bad, of her body. Another takes a job at the one hour photo after failing to sell her home made wrapping paper. Mommie dear thinks maybe her liposuction doctor is flirting with her.
All you are left with is the feeling of having looked through a neighbor's window. The lives of these women occupy the space between tragic and heroic, in sight of both but touching neither.

1782512,3,B00006JU8B,"""Lovely and Amazing"" is much of what ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" never was. It's about real women, women who make their own beds and lie in them, instead of having one disaster after another thrust upon to make their life miserable. It's about choices; a movie is usually far more exciting when a character makes decisions, instead of having the obvious thrown in their face.
 Eepecially good is Catherine Keener as a housewife entirely of bereft of ambition outside of erecting her worthless wooden crafts, which she insists on trying to sell for outrageous sums to unsmiling art dealers. Keener -- by choice, I suppose -- has shoehorned herself into playing the square peg in the round hole -- a sardonic, mouthy type who knows and thinks more than her position in life would indicate.
 There are two other sisters; One a shallow, insecure actress (Emily Mortimer) with a soft spot for stray animals, and the other an adopted 10-year-old black girl who's eaten too much fast food, has anger issues, and can hold her breath underwater a dangerously long time. Their mother is a fading beauty in her late fifties (Brenda Belthyn) heading in for plastic surgery.
 Visually, ""Lovely and Amazing"" is a little flat, which is fine for a talky, ruminating movie. Writer/director Nicole Hofencofer does a nice spoof on Hollywood agents and television hunks; one in particular, played by Dermot Mulroney, is more than interested in Mortimer's character outside of the audition room, even if they look like groping, suckfaced fools on the casting couch.
 Running through the two older sisters is a streak of self-torture -- Keener seems to like brawling with snobbish store owners, while Mortimer relishes the opportunity to have a man point out her physical flaws -- while the young girl is just beginning to learn, in possibly unhealthy ways, how to negotiate her own demons. The movie seems to hint, in fact, that troubled years are ahead for all of them, especially for Keener, who finally gets a job at a photolab only to start an affair with the 17-year-old manager. Mortimer, on the other hand, get the sadistic wish of temporary disfigurement through canine intervention.
 Blethyn spends much of the movie in the hospital enduring complications from her surgery, so she isn't left much to do. And yet she uses the inflections in her voice in more than one interaction with her daughters to suggest her disappointment, even as she describes them as the movie's title, ""lovely and amazing."" It's a cute term of endearment, empty given the circumstances, although, given a better roll of the dice, we can see where these women might have been more.",1050537600,6,2657,4.921875
1782513,4,B00006JU8B,"The four females in ""Lovely & Amazing"" look at themselves through a self-cracked mirror. Jane (Brenda Blethyn) is a well-off woman in her 50s who cares enough about others to adopt Annie (Raven Goodwin), an 8-year-old African-American girl whose birth mother is a crack addict. Jane also cares enough about herself to sign up for cosmetic surgery ($10,000 a pop and no insurance) to remove 10 pounds from her midriff.
Along with Annie, Jane has two adult daughters. The older one, Michelle (Catherine Keener), is a former homecoming queen who has turned into a childish, self-centered neurotic. Though Michelle's husband constantly prods her to get a job, she fancies herself an artist. She makes miniature chairs to sell to knickknack shops, but no one's buying.
Michelle's younger sister, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), is a beautiful aspiring actress who's already landing some small movie roles. But she has such a distorted self-image that she thinks of herself as unattractive -- even as she's posing for a photo spread in Vogue. Asked to do a ""chemistry"" audition with a big star named Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney), she's forced to listen while casting agents casually appraise her sexuality -- or lack thereof.
Both sisters are stuck in unfulfilling relationships. Elizabeth's overcritical live-in boyfriend is tired of hearing her obsess about her auditions, her resume photos, her agent, etc. Meanwhile, Michelle's sullen self-absorption and testy attitude have worn down her husband to the point that he's not especially interested in sleeping with her. To spite him, she takes a menial job at a one-hour photo shop, where her teenage boss (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes a Mrs. Robinson-like interest in her.
As she proved in her fine 1996 film, ""Walking and Talking,"" director Holofcener has an uncanny understanding of people as well as a gift for sharp, funny dialogue. Yes, ""Lovely & Amazing"" will probably spawn noxiously shallow lifestyle pieces on why women have poor self-esteem. But the film is much subtler and more complex than that.
The entire cast is terrific, from Goodwin to Mulroney. But you have to focus on Keener, perhaps best known for her role as the merciless co-worker of John Cusack in ""Being John Malkovich,"" who's become the Queen of Late Summer. She's creating her own type -- the acerbic smarts and ironic world-view of wisecracking dames like Rosalind Russell or ""Frasier's"" Peri Gilpin, with a twist of simmering anger and a drop of self-loathing. As vulnerable as she is venomous, she doesn't want to be the way she is, but she can't quite give it up, either.
Deftly directed, winningly acted and shrewdly written, ""Lovely & Amazing"" is as softhearted as it is ruthless, as amusing as it is poignant, but it does have its faults. Mostly, it doesn't offer a lovely and amazing final resolution, one reason why I wish it went on longer.

After reading a few of the reviews here, I need to explain that I am a ""guy"" & YES I loved it. I don't think it is a WOMAN's picture at all.  It's more of a slice-of-life film about how we all have our limits and struggles no matter what our place is in our family units, and how much they rely on us.

1782517,4,B00006JU8B,"Nicole Holofcener's Lovely And Amazing has alot of  terrific moments, but overall pales in comparison to her earlier Walking And Talking.  The comedic tone this time is a lot darker as we observe a few days in the life of a mother and her three ""screwed-up"" daughters (two biological adults and an adopted African-American child).
Holofcener again uses the acerbic Indie staple Catherine Keener, who plays the lazy, bored and arrogant eldest daughter. Keener is without doubt the best thing here, she's played this character many times before but does it so well the repitition hardly matters. If only the other characters were as engaging (or as painfully true to life).
Lovely And Amazing suffers from the presence of a few flat (male) characters and one too many unresolved subplots.
It's a more ambitious film than Walking And Talking and that's probably why it's not as satisfying.
In an age of expensive, overpraised, CGI smothered, Tinseltown atrocities, the very existence of a small budgeted delight like Lovely And Amazing is quite revolutionary.",1041206400,3,1056,5.133720930232558

Four females, all vulnerable, insecure, trying to find their way through the wilderness.  No neat answers or comforting happy endings, just a gradual working through of a few issues here and there.  Nothing is easy or predictable here, but everything is always interesting, even when nothing much is really happening.
Katherine Keener is excellent as usual playing her usual shrewish role, Emily Mortimer is irresistible especially during her glorious 3 minutes of full nudity, Jake Gyllenhall bears a striking resemblance to Tobey Maguire and is equally talented...there's not a bad thespian in the whole film!

1782519,4,B00006JU8B,"""Lovely and Amazing"" is a vivid portrait of a middle-class American mother and her three daughters. It is sometimes funny and sometimes sad. There are few pat answers here, no moral judgments, and no calls for vengeance against males or society in general. It simply presents some of the problems women face today, then lets the viewer come up with his or her own thoughts on the issues.
Jane Marks [Brenda Blethyn] has decided to have liposuction at the age of fiftysomething. She asks her older daughters, Michelle [Catherine Keener] and Elizabeth [Emily Mortimer] to look after the youngest sibling, Lorraine [Aunjanue Ellis], an adopted Afro-American. All of these women have serious issues. Jane is fighting her advancing age. Michelle is an artistic type who has never found a satisfactory outlet for her talents and whose marriage is decidedly rocky. Elizabeth is an actress obsessed with her body, her looks and her image in general. Lorraine has a weight problem and confusion about her identity. This may sound like the ingredients for a soap opera or a dark comedy, but it is neither. It is a deeply etched group of character studies, and one of the most honest and revealing movies about women I have ever seen.
Greatly adding to the film's impact are the performances by all of the female leads. In supporting roles, Jake Gyllenhaal and Dermot Mulroney are excellent as the men that Elizabeth and Michelle turn to in their desperation.",1038700800,3,1448,4.938524590163935
1782520,4,B00006JU8B,"LOVELY & AMAZING is just what this beautiful little film is.  Though the main characters are all bruised women - wannabe actress, flailing crafts-maker housewife, adopted African American 8 year old who grapples with obesity/skin color/genetic parent memories, and the mother of all three of these who places her 'embarassingly aging body' in the hands of a plastic surgeon - the etiology of thier dysfunction is tightly joined to their questionable ability to interact with men.  The men range from a womanizing husband, an insensitive lover, an 'unavailable' doctor who begin the path toward the women's testing their needs and fears with movie stars and adolescents.  In the hands of a lesser writer/director this could be corny, but with Nicole Holofcener's skill she creates plausible people and situations that are the perfect blend of  comedy with tragedy.  The cast is outstanding:  Brenda Blethyn's mother demonstrates once again how versatile this actress truly is, Catherine Keener and Emily Mortimer and Raven Goodwin give us fully realised characters and the contributions of the ""good guys"" Jake Gyllenhall and  Dermot Mulroney really bring heart to the story.  The remainder of the cast is uniformly strong.  Some people are classifying this as a ""Chick Flick"", but speaking as a man I think there is much to be learned about the frailties and strengths of women and the concurrent availability of worthwhile men available to them if each can swim past the social and emotional barricades we learn and see the lovely and amazing aspects of the individual heart.",1038528000,18,1576,5.173228346456693
1782521,4,B00006JU8B,"My first reaction after watching the film was ""Gee, actors/actresses are so seasonal.""  Catherine Keener was just in S1m0ne and Jake Gyllenhaal was just in The Good Girl (playing pretty much the same character who has relationships with older women).
Setting the trivial aside, I think Nicole Holofcener's ""Lovely and Amazing"" is an interesting, albeit a little bit depressing, film of three sisters (two biological, and one adopted) with problems on just about everything - life, love and career.  This film follows the ups and the downs of the Marks women in their various quests for boyfriends, better looks, fulfilling jobs, etc.
Catherine Keener is the cornerstone of this film.  She plays Michelle Marks, the eldest daughter of Jane (Brenda Blethyn).  Michelle is a stay-at-home wife who likes to dabble in handicrafts (which she desperately tries to sell).  Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer) is Michelle's younger biological sister.  She's an actress with a heart of gold but with major insecurities about her looks.  Annie (Raven Goodwin) is Jane's adopted African-American daughter (thereby making her the stepsister of Michelle and Elizabeth); she also has the most memorable scenes.  Her naive view of the world and her strong sense of self makes up for the ""amazing"" in the title.
Things just don't go right for any of the women.  Michelle's marriage has stagnated, and she is obliged to find a job.  Elizabeth was turned down for a role opposite Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney) for not being ""sexy"" enough.  Annie is confused at why she's so different from her sisters (skin color and all).  Jane suffers post-operative complications from her liposuction.  Just when all the world seems to tumble and fall, the Marks women take comfort in knowing they still have each other to hold on to.  Now that's the ""lovely"" part of this movie.
I think this film is geared more towards a female audience.  I'm not saying men wouldn't enjoy this film either, but it would hardly be one they would watch alone.  ;)

The filmmakers have held a mirror to nature, and though the image is distorted because it is larger than life, I'd be surprised if every viewer did not find some part of themselves in anyone of the characters.  Many of the laughs are generated in moments of audience recognition.  The style is naturalistic, and there were scenes in which I felt like a total voyeur. - uncomfortable but strangely attracted.

The movie's about an extended family (grandmother, three daughters (one an adopted kid), and husband/boyfriends/others) of mostly unpleasant, often immature people.  Might be OK if you are feeling bad about your emotional life and want to feel better by seeing others in worse shape.  Don't expect to be entertained, amused, informed or uplifted.  It does have a couple of titillating scenes to keep guys from walking out.",1475020800,2,479,5.181818181818182
7970689,5,B00006JU8B,"LOVELY AND AMAZING (2001) is a color film taking place in a big city.  In a nutshell, the plot takes the form of several types of little stories.  These stories concern:

(1) Boyfriend and actress girlfriend, living together, but not liking each other;
(2) Married arts and crafts hobbyist, who suffers from repeated failures in attempts to sell her crafts, and eventually has a sex affair with a 1-hour film processing clerk;
(3) Ten year old African American girl, with self-esteem problems, who is an adopted daughter of an older white woman.  Of special significance are two scenes in a public swimming pool;
(4) The older white woman's issues with her own self-esteem, who gets liposuction to shed ten pounds.

The characters (I use the actual names of the actors) include BRENDA BLETHYN.  She is an older woman with two adult daughters, and the mother of an adopted ten year old African-American girl.  The girl is Raven Goodwin, born in 1992.  The girl is chubby, and her character has self-esteem problems.

EMILY MORTIMER plays an actress.  She is slender and beautiful, but a recurring issue in this film is her alleged ""flabby arms.""

CATHERINE KEENER is a chronically unemployed arts'n'crafts hobbyist who is married, but eventually lands a job at a 1-hour photo lab, and has a love affair with the clerk (about ten years younger than she).  The clerk is played by JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

The way the movie is organized, is that it devotes a few minutes to a first story, and then a few minutes to a second story, then a minute to a third story, and so on, and then gets back to the first story, and then gets back to the second story, and so on and so forth.  This way of organization works very well, and the result is a compelling drama.  The different little stories share the same characters, and the result is a tightlyorganized overall plot.  What is common in each and every one of these stories is slight tension and difficulty in the ""game of life.""  The dialogue is especially clever, though in a way difficult to describe.  A person trained in scriptwriting will be able to describe the style of the dialogue.  Because I am not quite able to describe why the dialogues are so compelling, I will only reiterate them. Excerpts appear below.

The film opens with KEENER entering a gift shop with a box of her newest attempt at arts'n'crafts.  It takes the form of little chairs made out of twigs and weeds.  Another customer, and old friend from her teenaged years, enters the gift shop, and the pair have a little chit-chat.  ""What about you, what are you up to?""  ""I'm a pediatrician,"" says the old friend.  ""Are you kidding me?"" exclaims KEENER with a nervous laugh.  ""No, why?"" replies the pediatrician with a stern voice.  ""Oh, I don't know, it seems, it seems too fast.""  ""Oh, we're 36,"" explains the pediatrician with a smile.  ""I know,"" replies KEENER, ""but we're not THIRTY SIX thirty six.""  (Please note that the first 36 is intended to mean older age and maturity.)  The pediatrician's cell phone beeps.  ""Dr. Waldman,"" she answers, and then she dismissively tells her friend, ""You were always so creative.""  Then, the pediatrician leaves the gift shop.

As part of the gift shop scene, the clerk asks, ""How much would you sell them for?"" KEENER responds, ""I would need to make about $50 for each one.""  But the clerk is not interested, and she replies, ""That's okay, they're not for us anyway.""  KEENER mutters, ""Bitch!""  The owner of the store is also at the front desk, and the owner exclaims, ""Excuse me?"" with an offended expression.

This next excerpt, which takes the place in the bedroom of BLETHYN's home, further demonstrates KEENER's unhappy personality.  This except also demonstrates the cute linguistic dialogue trick of repeating a word twice in a row.  Please note the occurrence of ""THIRTY SIX thirty six"" mentioned above.  In the bedroom scene, KEENER and BLETHYN are admiring an assembly of large pillows on a bed.  ""Maybe I should be making pillows,"" suggests the daughter (KEENER).  Referring to her attempts to sell her twig chairs at the gift shop, BLETHYN asks, ""Any luck at the gift store?""  ""No, but I ran into Debbie Waldman . . . she used to be such a loser.""  Then the mother gets a little edgy and exclaims, ""Maybe you should get a job, you know a JOB-job!!!""  ""Thanks for your support,"" says KEENER sarcastically.

LOVELY & AMAZING is a movie that invites repeated watchings.  FIVE STARS to this great drama.",1467331200,,4465,4.72279792746114
