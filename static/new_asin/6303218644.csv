7841661,5,6303218644,"We still have snow on the ground but it is opening day of Baseball which means it is time to get once again watch Ken Burns' celebrated documentary on ""Baseball"" as a true rite of spring.  The second volume, ""Something Like A War"" covers the sport's first decade in the 20th century.  The decade begins with ""Ban"" Johnson creating the American League by sheer force of will (and the $500 more a season he offered players to bolt from the National League).  Opposing Johnson was John McGraw, the great manager of the New York Giants, who was aided by Christy Mathewson, the Christian Gentleman who was Frank Merriwell incarnate.  However, on the field the decade was clearly defined by the Detroit Tiger's Ty Cobb, for whom baseball was truly ""something like a war.""  In contrast to the vitriolic Cobb, the other chief contender for the title of best player in the game, Honus Wagner of the Pirates, is shunted into the background.  Burns also develops the richness of the game, including sections of the Cuban X-Giants and the other independent professional Negro teams, as well as Alta Weiss, the woman who became a semi-pro pitcher.  Ever episode makes a specific point of setting up the moment when Jackie Robinson will break the color barrier.  It is this comprehensive coverage of the game combined with its sense of the social importance of the game that makes this series an absolute classic.  Just hearing John Chancellor's voice makes me think of baseball.",986083200,,1465,4.828
