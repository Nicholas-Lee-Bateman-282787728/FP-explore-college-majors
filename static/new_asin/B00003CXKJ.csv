1281422,1,B00003CXKJ,"I went to see this movie at a special for-free screening and was mad because it wasted my time.  This movie is not entertaining flat out.  One:  The story has been done to death.  This version does put more comedy into it but not enough to talk about.  Two:  All the best parts were on the preview.  I know it's a cliche' but it's true if you watched the preview there is no need to see the movie , other then to waste an hour and a hlf of your life.  Three: totally predictable build up with the most anti-climactic/entertaining ending of 2000!  The only thing Bedazzling about this movie was Liz Hurley's outfits. Sorry, 1 star",980812800,4,629,4.3076923076923075
1281423,3,B00003CXKJ,"I've not seen the original, so I can't compare the two, but this update was a fairly clever light movie, played strictly for laughs.  Elizabeth Hurley must be the most benign devil ever imagined--although she does make Brendan Fraser's wishes go astray, she also gives him a pager (press 666) which allows him to return to his normal existance without harm.  It's quite a different take on ol' Satan, and although at one point she loses her temper, that's the only threatening moment.  Eternal damnation seems more like a party that's gone on a little too long than Dante's grim visions of torment.  Although making theological arguements surely wasn't its intent, Beelzebub's portrayal as a trickster rather than a torturer is intriguing.  Satan's origin as an angel created by God himself and therefore an aspect of God himself is appropriate for the complex world in which we live.  Hurley's devil is not Evil incarnate, and indeed, at one point she appears as an angel in white with wings and halo, although she says ""Don't get excited, it's just a Halloween costume.""  And most theologically interesting is the statement by one particular character to the effect that it didn't matter if someone sells their soul, because a person's soul isn't theirs to sell.  The implication here, although it wasn't followed up because it would have made the ending moot, is that Satan is ultimately powerless--powerless to collect the debt, and powerless to prevail over God's love.  Indeed, ultimately Satan is just another of God's creatures, working to God's mysterious purpose.
That said, convervative Christians are most likely to disagree with me and will probably despise every minute of this movie.  They are likely to take one of two interpretations: that this movie glorifies the devil, or conversely, that it falsely and dangerously obscures his evil powers.
Myself, I mostly thought it was a pretty funny movie.",980208000,2,1915,5.050793650793651
1281424,3,B00003CXKJ,"Brendan Fraser has been put on this Earth to make movies that are only supposed to entertain. This is one of them. The movie does not try to go any further than it should, it only tries to get laughs. And at most points, it succeeds.
Elliot is a loser who has little to no social skills at all. He is heavily attracted to a coworker, but does not offer her anything that she is looking for. In comes the Devil, played by the worst of the worst, Elizabeth Hurley. She offers Elliot 7 wishes. He only has to say what he wants, and it comes true, if it were not for that terrible actress that plays the Devil. The Devil ruins every one of his wishes, and this is where the film gets way to predictable. At the end of all his fantasies, you can pretty much predict that things will not work, but they attempt to get laughs along the way.
 Overall the film is watchable, but it does not take advantage of all of its opportunities. This film could have done much more, and offered us bigger laughs, but it went for the easy out and did not get too ambitious.",979603200,2,1052,4.1568627450980395

1281565,5,B00003CXKJ,This is one of the best Branden comedies out there. Not everything you wish for is good for you.,1500681600,,96,4.105263157894737
1281566,4,B00003CXKJ,"however cataclysmic something might be, never assume you have a complete handle on it. the frequency of remakes despite the fact that they're usually crap, a long-standing pet-peeve of mine, has a bummer side-effect that only just barely occurred to me: that occasional remake that actually works, or at least doesn't quite suck, might suffer guilt by association.
and to be fair, remakes can be pulled of if the wind is in the right direction. if it's an homage, for instance. Peter Jackson's grateful and fawning version of King Kong would be everything such a film should be if it were about half an hour shorter. the recent sorority version of Ghostbusters did an impressive job of juggling affection for the original with it's own contemporary slant.
roughly 1% of remakes even manage to top the original. The Maltese Falcon resulted in two undistinguished B-movies before John Huston and Humphrey Bogart got their hands on it. Steve Martin's version of Father Of The Bride takes up the slack for a once great film that hadn't aged very well. my favorite movie, Lord Of The Rings, vastly improves on a '70s cartoon film so half-assed it couldn't even be bothered to finish the story!
i don't mean to suggest that Harold Ramis' version of Bedazzled is quite in their league. a handful of drawbacks keep it from quite replicating the magic of the original. still, it's a delightful and engaging film when judged at it's own level. it has it's own ideas and runs with them.
before becoming an international household name in his own right, Dudley Moore was predominantly known in England for his collaborations with one Peter Cook. the two were sort of the Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie of the '60s, and the original Bedazzled is often hailed as the partnership's masterpiece. it did have a few touches that, alas, this one might appears poorer for lacking.
one of it's most memorable gimmicks is human representations of The Seven Deadly Sins. Raquel Welch is absolutely smokin' (and regrettably underused) as Lust. Barry Humphries' fey take on Envy is a veritable prototype for the Dame Edna character that later put him on the map. at one point, The Devil arranges a date for Dudley Moore with Gluttony, a pudgy woman who never says anything because here mouth is never empty enough.
it also had more of a philosophical side. much is made of Satan's tumultuous relationship with The Man Upstairs, culminating in the suggestion that he's currently on a probation of sorts. he also fears he's declining, because after centuries of plagues and wars, the best he can do is lately is advertising.
still, it's to Ramis' credit that he didn't simply replicate the film. like most better remakes, his own version works (when it does) precisely because he does his own thing rather than playing Follow The Leader.
his cast, for instance, is impeccable. Brendan Fraser, one of the Industry's most underrated leading men before he just sort of evaporated, is the ideal choice for our everyman lead. could he possibly be improved upon? i guess you could build a time machine, go back to the late '30s, and get Jimmy Stewart. but of course that just opens that whole temporal paradox can of worms, so maybe it's for the best.
not the least inspired of the new ideas is the notion that The Unholy One, master of temptation and seduction, might in fact be a woman, and it's hard to think of another actress as sexily sinister as Elizabeth Hurley. although it sort of backfired. more than one person has asked why someone in such proximity to the exotic Hurley would pine for a wholesome everywoman like Frances O'Connor. i can see how it might seem comparable to having a shot with Angelina Jolie only to throw her over for Phyllis Diller, but i can't help thinking you'd have to completely miss the point of the film for such a thing to occur to you.
the weakest moments of the original tend to be it's wish-fulfillment fantasies, a few of which frankly drag. Ramis generally makes up for that with energy and wit. take Fraser's first wish to be rich, which, due to a surplus of gray area left unspecified, results in his becoming a Colombian drug czar. his overthrow by rivals bring a pinch of action-adventure miles removes from anything Cook and/or Moore ever did. i think my favorite is when, having determined he has a chance to become a force for good, he wishes to be president. he becomes Abraham Lincoln...about two minutes before John Wilkes Booth arrives.
but that's pretty much par for the course. when there's two versions of something and both have merit, it's always regrettable that all the good parts can't quite intersect.
Carl Reiner's film Oh God! is one of those faultline films that either works for you or doesn't. i'm one of those for whom it was just too maudlin, but it did make one point that's stayed with me: The Almighty, as played by George Burns, deduces from the recent success of The Exorcist that ""The Devil you can believe in, but not God, huh?""
that's a rather sobering observation. what it says about the world in general is too depressing to contemplate, but what it says about drama is understandable. villains are often, up to a point, more relateable than the hero. in feudal times, in fact, passion plays and the like frequently cast The Devil as the comic relief, feeling that took a bit of the ""edge"" off the matter. to this day the notion persists that, in a dramatic sense at least, purity comes at the cost of multifacetedness.
Monty Python put it best, referring to their film Life Of Brian. they had set out to do a parody of Jesus Christ, but it turned out couldn't. not they SHOULDN'T, because it'll piss somebody, but that it literally couldn't be done. their research reflected how wise and ethical and tolerant He really was. humor serves largely as a catharsis, so comedy directed at specific person usually aims to take them down a peg, whereas if anything The Savior could stand to be raised a peg or two. in other words, Jesus was just too caring, too nice, to be funny.
their film ultimately reset it's sights on the pompous hypocrisy of religion officials who distort the so-called Word Of The Lord to serve their own agendas. it ended up featuring only one outright criticism of Jesus, which ultimately denigrates the criticizer more than the criticized: a disgruntled ex-leper, whom you'd think would be grateful to be cured, bemoans the fact that he can't beg anymore. (""...not so much as a by-your-leave, and there goes me livelihood."" ""there's no pleasing some people."" ""that's what Jesus said."")  not exactly the sort of thing to inspire a mass exodus to the dark side, now is it?
so basically, The Devil's issues come with layers, making him/her a much more fruitful a subject for a story and/or movie. that makes sense. for better or worse.",1499126400,,6798,4.7318718381112985

Brendan Fraser does his patented clueless dweeb schtick in place of Dudley Moore's more sad-sackish turn, while Elizabeth Hurley's Devil is more beguiling than Peter Cook's just plain weird Beelzebub.

1284905,4,B00003CXKJ,"Liz Hurley's performance was literally a black hole of suck, but the movie itself had me rolling in the floor. I'm a huge fan of the original movie with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, so I had my doubts about a remake. But between Brendan Fraser and Orlando Jones, I was not disappointed. I laughed until I cried. And Orlando Jones' impression of the horrible broadcasting skills of basketball great Isiah Thomas made me have to hit pause until I could stop laughing. They totally carried the movie. But Liz Hurley certainly has the right name. Every scene she was in just made me want to hurl. Her performance (or lack thereof) did nothing but bring down what was otherwise a hilarious movie.

She took Peter Cook's character and murdered it in cold blood. She's a beautiful woman, no doubt. But SHE CANNOT ACT, PEOPLE!!! And apparently, she cannot walk either. I mean, what was with that boppy, bouncy thing she was doing? Was that supposed to be sexy? It totally wasn't. It was just really distracting and annoying. Peter Cook was drop dead gorgeous, but that wasn't what sold his character. His character worked because he was an incredible actor and funny as hell, made funnier by the fact that he and Dudley Moore had mad chemistry together. But Liz Hurley is NOT FUNNY. Not at all. And there was zero chemistry between her and Brendan Fraser, though God bless him, he certainly tried.

She has no rhythm, no range in her facial expressions, no comedic timing, and no feel whatsoever for what makes a person funny and the filmmakers knew it, which is why she spent most of the movie in a bikini or dressed like a call girl. Sexy is all she's got. But the part called for funny, not sexy. She was hopelessly miscast and way, Way, WAY out of her league. Now Sandra Bullockthat is a beautiful woman with a killer body, but she has a genius for comedy. Julia Roberts, same thing. And they're funny in clothing. They don't need to be naked to be entertaining.

All the skimpy costumes Hurley wore were a device strategically designed to distract the male audience from noticing her obvious lack of acting chops. They couldn't even put her in a decent business suit when she was supposedly dressed as a lawyer. That suit was an insult to female attorneys everywhere and it made her look like a stripper ready to pop out of a birthday cake, but what else could they do? Without the sexy wardrobe, she's invisible. Minus Liz Hurley, I'd absolutely have given this movie five stars. Too bad they can't remake the remake with a better actress.",1462147200,,2537,4.596026490066225

Some enjoyable Harold Ramis flavor as well, though it feels a little watered-down and bogged by what I imagine probably began as a list of production ""notes"" from the always-outta-touch Top Brass, maybe a bunch of misguided, overly-sensitive suggestions to ""tone down"" the more ""alienating"" religious nuances, to maximize mass-appeal and minimize perceptions that religious or theological ties are prerequisite to enjoying the film.

1286756,3,B00003CXKJ,"I enjoy watching Brendan Fraser and in this movie it was about a geek at work that is targeted by Satan in disguise as Elizabeth Hurley. But I guess the devil can disguise himself to whatever form is appropriate for each of his victims. I had started watching it but never got very far with it. Finally, I put my foot down and watched it completely. He received everything he asked for but in that everything had a price he had to pay for each wish. I guess that is when the cliche' comes in. Be careful what you wish for. In the end, when he shows compassion for someone else, the devil releases him from his contract (the devil does not like it when something good comes out of what you wish for), he actually receives what he was looking for, love and respect; not necessarily in that order.",1454198400,,794,4.3

1287571,5,B00003CXKJ,"Harold Ramis's version of Bedazzled finally gets a hd  blu ray version
But, Anchorbay/Starz goes the cheap route and just puts the film out in HD
So if you had the Special Edition dvd originally put out on dvd by 20th Century Fox (2000) hold onto that version too

This blu ray is bare (Keep in mind during the start of the dvd boom Anchorbay use to go all out now during the blu ray era not at all)
the disc itself is a 25GB blu-ray disc but, anchorbay couldn't port all the extras on this disc?!?!
The transfer is really nice (If you compare the original special edition dvd to this blu ray it's night and day in video quality)
For a somewhat old catalog title it looks really nice all around
The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio track is passable (could be better but, it could also be much worse)

Why keep the original Special Edition dvd ?
the dvd is THX Certified in 2015/2016 is that a big deal? i guess that all depends
Bonus Features include
1. Audio Commentary track by the late (Director) Harold Ramis,
2. Audio Commentary by Elizabeth Hurley and Trevor Albert
***Making of featurette,
***Costume Design Featurette,
***Still Gallery, plus much more
Those are mostly all very cool ""legit"" extras
But, if you just like movies and not into extras keeping the original might be a waste

The original Bedazzled while cleaver and enjoyable it's also a massive slow burn
Peter Cook works for a 1976 version of the devil
Dudley Moore (very young) is likable as  Stanley Moon
Raquel Welch is the perfect Lust till the end of time

Remaking Bedazzled isn't really a sin compared to if you remake The Exorcist, Wizard of Oz, and  Citizen Kane
as far as Hollywood lazy soul sucking remakes this film is a massive upgrade
mostly in part with having such a smart and talented Director in Harold Ramis
Ramis didn't do this film for quick cash you can tell there was love and respect put into this update

Brendan Fraser (Elliot)  is much like Dudley Moore likable and grounded in reality he has to sell the performance  since each wish changes him in all types of ways. (Maybe one of Fraser's best role's in terms of acting)
 Elizabeth Hurley  as The Devil (Brilliant out of the box thinking I've seen other reviewers over think This version of the devil
That he's a male pretending to be a female but, that don't fit! Why can't the Devil be a female?
I can honestly buy that the devil could be a woman and Hurley helps sell that x5
her performance isn't breaking any new ground but, she is very good
the sexy British  accent and Hurley being stunningly beautiful makes sense that she is the devil

This film overall is a lighthearted silly fun film it's 15 years old and there really hasn't been a film like this since
Which is sad and a bit telling where Comedy's have gone since 2000
This is without a doubt one of Harold Ramis most underrated films  9.4/10",1451520000,6,2847,4.458574181117534

The actors are great and work very naturally together. Brendan Fraser has a good feel for comedy and was wonderful with his character as was Elizabeth Hurley. I also enjoyed the brief appearance of the ""good Friend"".

1287637,4,B00003CXKJ,"No part of this movie really excels.  The acting is just okay.  The many vignettes are amusing, but none of them really stood out for me.  The special effects are cheesy, but they work.  And the overall story is simple with no surprises.  In spite of this, the sum of all the parts make this movie better than what it initially seems.

At it's heart, it's a comedic morality tale with a hint of romantic comedy  thrown in.  In practice, it's basically a series of fairly amusing vignettes framed as the lead characters various corrupted wishes in exchange for his soul.  And the wishes themselves are framed around some fantasy involving the lead characters crush.  Some of the vignettes are better than the others, and your actual enjoyment of this movie is going to ride on the strength of them.

Brandon Frasier does a decent job at playing a somewhat hapless and easily manipulated lead.  Elizabeth Hurley does a decent job playing the sexy and manipulative Satan.  The remaining cast of characters, who reprise many roles in the vignettes also perform decently.  None of the characters performances are likely to wow you, but they do their jobs.

Like I said, this movie is a light affair.  It's not totally dumb, but it's a terribly complex movie.  It's more just about seeing what wacky circumstances the main character can concoct for himself, and how Satan can corrupt those fantastical wishes.

It's just a perfectly harmless, but watchable movie.  Prime syndication material.  So it's highly likely that even if you haven't seen this movie before, you may have caught parts and pieces of it playing on tv.

Still, its a movie that I would say is worth watching.  It's a real popcorn movie, and one that probably won't stay with you long after viewing.  But I'd say it's still worth viewing, if you are in the mood for a light wacky comedy with a bit of sex appeal.",1449360000,,1875,4.684049079754601

Hurley is so incredibly sexy, she makes me want to sell her my own soul just to spend some ""quality time"" with her. Go ahead, buy this movie, and have a little quality time of your own.
It's nice when a comedy is actually clever, and this is one very clever movie.

I've had the DVD since it was first available and must have watched it 20 times over the yirz. The extras are great, especially the easter egg extra wish scene. Unfortunately, I lent the disk to sumwun who didn't give it back. I had a hankering to watch it so bought this wun. This edition has no extras! Bummer, man! So I can't recommend it. Get the dark background edition, even if its more expensive.

Hopefully, since Harold Ramis passed away a few months ago, they will produce a BR remastered version with all the extras along with all his movies as a tribute. The current blue ray has no extras.",1397347200,,867,4.124260355029586

1289014,3,B00003CXKJ,"This version of Bedazzled, an American remake of the 1967 British classic, falls far short of the original. While Dudley Moore as the pathetic protagonist and Peter Cook as the devil made me laugh out loud on a continuous basis (especially in the first half), this remake made me merely crack a smile a couple of times.

Brendan Frazer is no adequate comedic substitute for Dudley Moore, and a pretty face for a devil is no match for Peter Cook's awesome inventiveness as scriptwriter and actor/comedian. Regarding pretty faces: while Brendan's fellow office worker and major object of unrequited love is fairly nice to look at, Dudley Moore's fellow worker and major passion at a greasy diner, overly made up and extra bossy, is just a hilarious personality.

And then compare the situations. What is funnier: Dudley Moore being a nun on a trampoline or Brendan Frazer as a 7 1/2 ft. tall basketball player? Giving a frantically noisy raspberry to get out of a wish gone wrong or dialing 666 on one's cellphone? You get the picture.

1289259,4,B00003CXKJ,It's what you'd expect from the 90's. Amazon Prime is a gem for making it free w/ a Prime Membership.,1390262400,,101,4.1
1289260,5,B00003CXKJ,I watched it with my 20 year old son. We both liked it a lot. Who knew that Brendan Fraser can be so funny and silly! Watch out for his colleagues. They reappear several times in different roles and disguises.,1390262400,,209,4.25

1289405,5,B00003CXKJ,"This fun romp, written and directed by Egon from Ghostbusters (Harold Ramis). Stars my favorite late 90's - early 00's star Brendan Fraser. Also, it's Elizabeth Hurley's (Hugh Grant's ex) last major film role as a nearly loveable Devil, who offers Elliot Richards 7 wishes in exchange for his soul.  If you liked Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters etc you should get a kick out of this film.",1389916800,,384,4.818181818181818

I love Brendon Frasier and Elizabeth Hurley and all the silly scenarios. A great lesson in the old adage ""Be Careful What You Wish For!""",1389139200,,294,4.462962962962963
1289550,1,B00003CXKJ,"There are some ok actors and the story is a cute one, but the execution on this movie is pretty poor.  I would advice a pass on this unless you are really bored and just can't find anything else.",1388966400,,195,4.0

1289687,5,B00003CXKJ,Bedazzled is always a good choice.  Just watching Hurley strut around is worth the watch.  Brandon does a good job as well.,1388275200,,123,4.545454545454546
1289688,5,B00003CXKJ,Love this movie. Especially the scene where he wants to be rich and powerful. Turns him into Drug Lord and realizes he speaks fluent Spanish. Too funny!,1388275200,,152,4.666666666666667
1289689,5,B00003CXKJ,"This is one of my favorite comedies. Probably, the best performance of Brendan Fraser. Strangely enough, this one has a fairly low rating on IMDB (5.9). In my opinion, deserves much more.",1387929600,,187,4.875
1289690,4,B00003CXKJ,Great movie to be watched when you are not in a mood to watch something intense. Lightens you up. Fun to watch.,1387929600,,111,4.090909090909091

1289831,1,B00003CXKJ,Wish I could give it something less than one star. Watched about a quarter of the movie before just giving up.  Poorest role ever for Brendan Fraser. Plot is absurd as is the attempt at humor. Don't bother!,1387756800,,206,4.421052631578948
1289832,3,B00003CXKJ,I love Brendan Fraser but this script was weak and contrived. A bit racist (maybe a lot). Three stars are for eye candy Elizabeth Hurley.,1387670400,,137,4.52
1289833,3,B00003CXKJ,"Terrible movie but fun concept.  Elizabeth Hurley does a good job and saves it for Brenden Frazer.  This is kind of like watching White Chicks.  I will watch it but won't tell anyone I watched it, especially since when I tell people the title, they think I am putting sparkles on my jeans.",1387497600,,289,4.415094339622642

1289835,4,B00003CXKJ,My husband and I watched this together. We liked the ending and the story line. It was an unexpected end but good. It makes you think and is enjoyable to watch as well. It also had great entertainment value. It is worth watching again if you have already seen it. It is a good addition to the Amazon prime movie watching experience.,1387324800,,332,4.370967741935484

1289920,5,B00003CXKJ,I move to S.F. after this movie came out and it was just hilarious because my friend is just like Elliott!  Just too many cheezie/funny scenes that always gets my laughing.  Elizabeth Hurley is a hottie and I can never get sick of her and her accent.,1385251200,,250,4.297872340425532
1289921,4,B00003CXKJ,"The original film with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore is one of my favorites. I generally don't like remakes, but this was a very clever take on the original, and I've watched it several times. It takes the spirit of the original, and, while adapting it for American audiences, manages to keep up and still keep it amusing.",1385078400,,320,4.5344827586206895
1289922,3,B00003CXKJ,"As other reviewers already mentioned. This blu-ray disc does not include anything but the movie. Literally. No menus, no extra audio, subtitles, extras. NOTHING. My PS3 had some trouble playing it at the beginning with the audio and I couldn't figure out why, and the fact that it doesn't have a main menu or anything didn't help. This is such a good, funny movie that it definitely needs a better quality product for a blu-ray release. Even the DVD has an extra scene and definitely more options. Very disappointed with this one.",1384560000,3,530,4.771739130434782

1289926,5,B00003CXKJ,"My wife may or may not like this probably not.

For most guys this is a good movie.

Funny, really funny, quick moving, especially good for late at night after everyone else has gone to bed and you can watch in peace like if you work evenings or midnights and come home and watch movies on weekend because you can't sleep.

Well done hilarious movie.",1383264000,,350,4.3538461538461535

1290061,4,B00003CXKJ,"This is one of the rare times where I have enjoyed a remake as much as the original. They are, however, movies with a common plot line but sharing darn little else, so maybe that is why I can like both. The newer version lacks the social and religious satire of the original, but manages to be funny, well acted, and generally well written.",1381104000,,340,4.328125
1290062,5,B00003CXKJ,Great. A good original idea for a movi like Holywood hasn't shown for a long time now. Very funny and fun.,1380499200,,106,4.095238095238095

1290064,4,B00003CXKJ,The movie has some definite funny moments in it with good acting and writing. It can get a little preachy at times but should be expected for a movie with this story.,1380240000,,166,4.21875
1290065,3,B00003CXKJ,It was funny but not funny enough to watch more than once...too bad was really looking forward to something hilarious!,1380240000,,118,4.95

1290171,4,B00003CXKJ,This movie is pretty funny. There were some parts that were a bit cheesy but overall I thought it was good. And it was an interesting perspective to have the devil portrayed as a woman.  I would recommend it at least for anyone who likes a more upbeat movies with relatively clean humor,1379808000,,286,4.39622641509434

1290173,4,B00003CXKJ,"I remembered this movie as a cute romp & that's just exactly what it is.  It's not ""heavy"" - it's just light fare, but enjoyable. I do love Brendan Fraser and he really gets to ham it up quite a bit - especially love the scene where he is suddenly able to speak Spanish.  Elizabeth Hurley is definitely a light-weight (couldn't believe she was the devil if I tried!) but she doesn't hurt the eyes, and even if she isn't much of an actor, thankfully this role didn't require her to be. This is a cute film to watch when you don't want to watch anything heavier and just want to laugh out loud (which you will!)",1379289600,,609,4.196581196581197

I love the underlying story, about how we can choose which path to walk, and the subtlety used to get that point across. My teen boys love seeing Elizabeth Hurley in the bathing suit, and the schoolteachers outfit, LOL!

Her winking and sexual innuendo are enough to keep everything wide awake in this comedy directed by Harold Ramis.

This tries to be interesting, giving us many plot twists of how things could end up for Brendan, but it just gets weirder and more uncomfortable.

I'm comfortable with Brendan Fraser 1. taking off his shirt and being hot 2. Being a sympathetic character 3. Doing other hot stuff 4. Swinging from vines 5. discovering mummies 6. doing a combination thereof 7. Not being a total wuss-loser like he is in this movie.

Vulnerability is cool, but this movie just loses me. He just... he never gets to achieve his wicked-hot beefcake potential like in his other movies here. It's just creepy. There's something creepy happening here, dude.

I think he's good playing nerds, but they have to take their shirts off and not wuss out. The multiple endings were just too irritating, and I'm generally up for anything. I LOVED Sliding Doors, I LOVE Gwyneth Paltrow movies, tv shows, and songs, yet, I loathe Gwyneth Paltrow.

I have the movie with me and am a little disappointed and heres why

-No menu whatsoever this is as barebone as a Blu ray disk can get

-I don't think it wasn't mastered very well a few scenes are really blurry and it pans in and out sometimes but most of the movie is pretty sharp (watched it in a Samsung F7100 60"")

-No extra features the easter egg from the dvd is not there not even a commentary it goes from the FBI warning and straight into the movie

-No DTS HD Master audio, this might be nitpicking but MA sounds a whole lot better than DD HD Imo.

Overall i would take a Bad Blu ray release over no Blu ray release but was disappointed the movie itself is 5 stars imo but the Release itself is crap I just hope they don't pull an avatar and Re Release the Complete Disk later for $20

Each scene has to economically convey a funny AND poignant truth about relationships, incorporate all of the main characters, ( I had to watch it twice to realize his office friends are the other characters. Doh!) and find a creative and plausible way to make the scenario dissastisfying to the Elliot character. Fraser's performances are humorous and his characterization of the ""dork"" Elliot is terrifyingly real. The makeup and hair perfect each clever portrayal of the powerful, dumb, smart, sensitive roles he plays in trying to get ""the girl"" Costuming for Hurley was mad-crazy-good and she her Devilish attitude struck a surprisingly convincing note.

Second, shouldn't a person beware of what he wishes for? A very lonely nerdy man with terrible inter-personal skills, who repeatedly makes inappropriate comments in his clumsy attempts to ingratiate himself with people, is in love with a woman who works where he works, but who ignores him. He is approached by an extremely attractive woman in a tight red dress and an English accent who tells him she is the devil and will fulfill seven of his wishes if he signs a four inch thick contract which sells her his soul. As we can expect, although he gets exactly what he wishes, there are always things that he did not request that spoil his wish. An example is his first wish to be rich and married to the woman he loves. His wish is ruined because his wife despises and is committing adultery, and he is rich because he is a drug dealer whose business is threatened by other gangsters who want to take it over.

1292458,5,B00003CXKJ,"Brendan Fraser has taken some nasty hits recently. There are hair rumors, weight dissings, the whole Golden Globes clap n' point thing, and now ""Furry Vengeance,"" which, God help, has his name on it as star and executive producer. By all public appearances though, he's taken it all with grace. Yeah, he says, I added some pounds. I was at the Golden Globes and spazzed. Sure, my crotch gets attacked over and over in ""Furry Vengeance"" but it makes my kids laugh. The man seems to be an affable, self-effacing goofball who knows exactly who and what he is. In this regard, as far as movie actors go, he seems to stand alone.

Men want to despise men who women openly idolize. They get as snide as 14-year-old girls when they fall short in comparison. In their own testosterone pumped cattiness it seems they've been lying in wait for the nice-guy, lust-worthy ape-man to turn 40 and lose his ab definition so they can pounce.  What they underestimate is Brendan Fraser's fan base. His fans don't require a rippled stomach to continue their support. For most of them, it isn't about that.

There are hordes of dedicated Fraser fans who bristle more at the current attacks than Fraser seems to himself. For some, it started with George from ""George of the Jungle,"" embraceable not just for the lithe muscles, but for the charming innocence. Others were wooed by the Mummy's Rick O'Connell, an action hero with brilliant blue eyes, even bluer against the desert, who lets a smart woman take the lead with the full understanding that his strength is protecting her, not competing with her.  Perhaps it was ""baby-man"" Adam Weber from ""Blast from the Past,"" at age 35 discovering the world for the first time in late-1990's LA, where his good manners and well-rounded education were perceived as freakish. There may be some late bloomers who waited until they saw Uncle Trevor in 3D before they fell in line. (note:  if you need to be convinced of Brendan Fraser as egoless kook, listen to his commentary on the ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" DVD.  He lovingly calls out the movie's cheesiest moments, and as executive producer, he's well within his rights to do so, channels Mike Meyers, taunts himself and his little paunch, and even points out his own man-boobs. Which in turn begs the question, what other actor would be comfortable enough with himself to direct attention to his man-boobs? In 3D, no less?)

However, I may be the only fan newly recruited to the Brendan-cult by uber-nerd Elliot Richards. Everything I needed to gain respect for Brendan Fraser as an actor I found in ""Bedazzled.""

At the core of me, I was sure I would never waste my time on this movie. The poster/DVD cover with its red background and the sleazy picture of Fraser with Elizabeth Hurley, snake and flames repulsed me.  How many soul bartering devil movies does the world really need? We get it already. Don't negotiate with the devil. Hell, just avoid any conversation with the devil period. More importantly, don't bother with any movie that makes you cringe even before you see it. Yes, ""Inkheart,"" books are judged by their covers. That's why millions are spent marketing movies. In the case of ""Bedazzled,"" that money was a poor investment.

To summarize quickly--Elliot Richards is a socially inept dweeb who has a crush on an unattainable woman, making him the perfect patsy for a devil deal. He gets seven wishes before he hands his soul over, which means Elliot gets several makeovers as he wishes in multiple failed ways to be the man he is not.

Released a decade ago, ""Bedazzled"" wasn't particularly loved by the critics but it wasn't wholly panned, either. Despite the current perception, the reviews still available on the internet range from lukewarm to great. The New York Times describes the movie's setup then offers this: ""What follows is outrageous fun. Elliot, wishing himself rich, powerful and married to Alison, is transformed into a Colombian drug lord. Mr. Fraser is a master of goofy befuddlement, and his face as he discovers himself speaking Spanish is almost worth the price of the ticket."" Good or bad review, Fraser's performance was roundly praised.  The Times goes on to say, ""The physical transformations that Mr. Fraser undergoes in each scenario are impressive, but the real artistry is in his quick-change performance. He looks perpetually surprised at himself as he utters dumb- jock clichs, sings a song in praise of our friend the dolphin (complete with dolphin voices) and delivers nonsensical witticisms at a high-toned literary soire. With his slightly pudgy face and his loose, ungainly physical presence, he manages to be both likable and ridiculous."" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times didn't like the movie but still writes:  ""Fraser is a wonderful comic actor--better than he gets the credit for, because he creates funny characters instead of exploding in what is intended as funny behavior.""

What finally convinced me to see ""Bedazzled"" was Harold Ramis. Director and co-writer Harold Ramis' involvement was unknown to me until a couple of months ago and for me gave the movie comic street-cred.  If you don't know him, but his name sounds familiar it's because Harold Ramis directed or co-wrote cult-followed classic comedies starting in the days of SCTV and early SNL that became their own subgenre--movies like ""Animal House,"" ""Caddyshack,"" ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" and a personal favorite of mine, ""Groundhog Day."" For me that trumped Hurley, boa constrictor, and rewarmed concept. And I hate to say it, but Fraser.

Here's what happened. I rented the movie and watched it through stunned.  When it was over, I immediately went back and watched the first 10 minutes three or four times in a row. I knew Elliot Richards! There was an Elliot Richards sitting a few cubicles over from me at my office. I had avoided and insulted multiple Elliots through the years. That was me at the bar table, wincing as an uninvited Elliot approaches, realizing the chair next me is the only one available and that I'm trapped. When I've made inappropriate jokes that have fallen with a thud to the floor I've worried that I was an Elliot Richards.  I did not expect Fraser to play such an unflattering character. I did not expect his performance, from the broad strokes to the nuances, to be perfect.

As the devil twists his dreams into nightmares, Elliot is transformed physically to match each wishful scenario. For a good chunk of the movie, Fraser Is unrecognizable. He is prostheticed, wigged, freckled, and for one alter-Elliot, 3G enhanced.  The transformation I found most amazing was the most subtle. He wishes to be very handsome, sophisticated and intellectual. When he enters the scene, he looks different but I couldn't figure out how. His hair is parted on the side and coiffured back, but that wasn't it. This Elliot, as opposed to real Elliot, is dressed immaculately in an expensive suit, and has perfect posture, but that still didn't explain why Fraser didn't look like himself.  I inched through the frames, frustrated that I couldn't tell what was just off enough to not to be quite right. Then I realized it was his nose. They had altered his nose in the slightest way, making it more sloped and pointed.  Now it's one thing to say to a movie star, hey, for comedy's sake, we're gonna ginger you up with red hair, gooey freckled complexion and give you little teeth.  It's another thing entirely to say to a movie star, hey, to make you really handsome we have to change your face. The result is a hyper-handsomeness, bordering on caricature, which was exactly what was needed for comic effect.  But can you imagine broaching the subject with any leading man?  Wouldn't it result in a screaming diva debacle?

What I realized is that when Brendan Fraser commits to a movie, he commits whole-heartedly and with enthusiasm for the process. He appears to be willing to let go and do his part, trusting that the director, producers and creative team will do theirs. As film actors become more celebrated they also seem to become more controlling, and there isn't the sense that Fraser needs to do that. Good movie, bad movie, there is no slacking. He's obviously willing to do anything on behalf of the project no matter how it makes him look. Some may see his resume and wonder if he shouldn't have pushed back more often. If you're a director, though, he should top the list of actors who would be dreamboats to work with, seeing that Fraser lets his image take backseat to the director's vision. When a movie doesn't work, it's hard to blame him. He's doing everything he can, and when the material and director are good, Fraser's talent is in full evidence. Now, if he could just be a bit more selective about scripts and directors, he would find the respect for his acting that he's only had sporadically through the years.

I see all these qualities illustrated in ""Bedazzled."" He's fearless. When asked to sing like a dolphin, he does. It's ridiculous. It's also really funny. He doesn't hesitate to play Elliot full-dork, and, as mentioned earlier, he's perfect. The face, the posture, the voice, the laugh, the line delivery, the smile, he captures awkward and unattractive jerk with the same gusto that he did handsome matinee hero. The critics tend to like him in more serious roles, but he's a natural comedian and he's given the chance to prove it more so here than in his other comedies. He gets to be really good in what I find to be a surprisingly good movie and those things don't align for him as often as they should.

Having pleaded my case, I ask you to go back and see ""Bedazzled"" again, or if you haven't seen it, find it. In my opinion, it's Brendan Fraser at his best. Maybe you'll take away from it what I did--that Brendan Fraser is a likable, under-appreciated, talented actor. Appreciate that he always gives it his all, even in something as unworthy as ""Furry Vengeance"" and is managing to keep his sense of humor and humility despite the recent public malice. Give him a break, send him some love, and wish for a good script to come his way.  He's paid his dues.",1273622400,2,10163,4.798054919908467
1292459,5,B00003CXKJ,"This remake was made back in 2000, and I should have watched it in the theaters because it's very VERY hilarious! Brendan Fraser plays Elliot Richards, a man who doesn't have the nerve to ask a woman out but is desperate in doing so. That's when the Devil comes in. Played by Elizabeth Hurley, the Devil gives him seven wishes, but only if Elliot trades his soul in return. And as Elliot makes his wishes, hilarity ensues. There are tons of sight gags and some wordplay going around, and they made me laugh numerous times. Hurley was a surprise as Satan himself: she acts with charisma and wit, and her English accent adds to the much sophisticated appearance. Fraser always does well in comedies, and here he gives his usual great performance.

1292550,4,B00003CXKJ,"Harold Ramis [Ghostbusters] put together a fun film with the every boyish Brendan Fraser and the ever hot English actress Elizabeth Hurley as the hellish devil.

Brendan's character is a klutz with not too many social skills who just wants a change.  The Devil gives him three wishes -- the first is a cheeseburger -- and the story goes.  Elliott goes through some self-discovery and angst as he begins to realize that all he has ever wished for, he already has.

I found the drug cartel one especially funny.  I barely remember the Dudley Moore version and so won't attempt a comparison.  The comedic timing and music are really well done.  Kinda a morality slapstick play!

Commentaries by the actors and director, a ""making of"" featurette and Spanish subtitles are a light fare for this DVD.

The plot is somewhat similar to the original 1967 Bedazzled (which I would rate at 4 stars), but without the witty, funny dialog. And without Peter Cook's thought-provoking theological musings, or Dudley Moore's whimsical musical scoring. So the newer version of Bedazzled resembles the original in title only.

Elizabeth Hurley looks amazing in her many (and I do mean many) sexy outfits. Her face and body alone are worth watching for the 90 minutes, but her acting holds up good as well.

1292555,5,B00003CXKJ,"Let's be honest for a second; Brendan Fraser isn't exactly known as the worlds best actor and with that being said, this is the movie for him. It's silly and just requires someone to take on a few different roles withing the same movie. Bedazzled has always been one of my favourite movies as I'm a fan of silly comedy that at least has a point. The point of this movie? Well, I'm not really sure but I know there's one in there somewhere. After all, if you have a movie where the devil is played by one of the sexiest women in the world, there has to be a message in that movie. I'm thinking the scene set in the classroom in which Satan is a sexy teacher with a fetching belt... Sorry skirt.

Back to the movie. Fraser plays Elliot Richards, a lovable loser who really needs to catch a break. He's after the heart of one of his co-workers, Alison (Frances O'Connor) ((I know, she's terrible)) she doesn't notice him and probably doesn't even realise he exists. Elliot decides that the only way in which he can get Alison is to sell his soul to the devil. The only real problem is, that Satan is sexy, not just sexy but smoking hot. I guess that could be called ironic. The Devil's played by Liz Hurley by the way. Instead of just taking his soul for Alison, she instead offers him 7 wishes which place him in crazy situations that all give him the opportunity to win Alison over. He becomes a Basketball superstar, a drug lord and a gay academic.

This is a really good movie with effects that are done very well indeed. The scene in particular when he's a 7 foot basketball player really display the skill of the special effects team. I loved this movie and had some really great comic moments that I think everyone will enjoy.

1293544,3,B00003CXKJ,"Viewed on its own merits, this movie is a so-so dud.  Well-produced & attractive, but the humor is broad, physical, and not especially subtle.  Brendan Fraser is OK in his variety of roles, but Elizabeth Hurley is nothing more than eye candy and simply is not capable of making her character anything more than a series of slinky costume changes.  Considering that she plays one of the two principal characters, this poses a bit of a problem.  However, it doesn't appear to have disturbed a great number of testosterone-addled reviewers who reviews can be easily summed up as ""Elizabeth Hurley is so HOT!""  OK, then.

So --- without any context, it's just Meh.  When compared to the 1967 original, it is abysmal.  For those who say, just enjoy it for what it is & stop comparing to Moore & Cook:  well sorry, but IT IS A REMAKE, and by its very nature invites comparisons.  The comparisons are not good.  The trenchant wit & savage social commentary found in the original --- the elements which made the original so brilliant --- are utterly lacking in the newer version.  One can't disembowel a classic & not expect people to howl in disgust.

You never know what funny sarcastic thing Fraser will say next, and what Hurley will fire right back with!  There are elements of both flat-out humor, and subtle humor; which can mix well with the overall premice of the movie!

Yes, it's the old Faust story of selling one's soul to the devil.  But Brendan Frazier's Elliott Richards is such a likeable ""Everyman,"" that it's easy for us to share his frustration at being beaten at almost every step by ""the Devil.""

Speaking of ""the Devil,"" as good as Peter Cook was in the original, I can't imagine a more seductive and deceptive devil than Elizabeth Hurley.  She provides a biting sauce to an already fantastic meal.

You don't have to enjoy this on the ""literary level"" as a retelling of the Faust legend.

My Top 3 favorite ""situations"" are probably the ones where Brendan is the Colombian drug-lord, the Shaq-inspired basketball player, and the gay intellectual.

he has no friends, and nobody likes him cause he is the odd man out, he tries to fit in, but they won't give him a chance.

so after an unsuccessful attempt to talk to Alison, he says to himself that he would give anything to be with Alison, and BAM, along comes The Devil (Hurley), and she's beautiful, hot, and i love the way she talks in the movie.

she offers and entices him granting him 7 wishes for his soul, which he takes because he is so much in love with Alison, and what follows are a series of horribly bad wishes with good intentions.

He's a drug lord who finds out Alison is cheating on him, then he's a basketball huge basketball with a teenie tiny problem, he's President Lincoln one minute, an oversensative person who cries at sunsets, and then he's a gay intellecutal person with the opposite of his basketball problem.

also Orlando Jones comes out in the movie. (The Replacements, Drumline)

overall, Bedazzle is a good clean, sexy movie. Elizabeth Hurley is FINE in this movie, but keeps it clean and unlike other movies, this doesn't get out of hand. it's got a good message at the end to just be yourself.

1293695,3,B00003CXKJ,"This is a passably amusing remake of what I consider to be a classic comedy:  1967's ""Bedazzled"" with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook.

Director Harold Ramis, a veteran of television's Second City comedy show, probably thought it would be a piece of cake to update the original film.  He Americanized the fantasy vignettes in the film, by making them more physical, cruder, and more obvious.  But, what he couldn't replicate was the chemistry of Moore and Cook, who worked together as beautifully as Laurel and Hardy.

Brendan Fraser, often buried under a lot of make-up, helps to make this new version watchable.  He's very animated and funny.  The script is sometimes clever, but doesn't approach the razor shape wit displayed in the first film.  The musical score is unimaginative, contrasted with the delightful pop pastiches that Dudley Moore created the first time around.

Elizabeth Hurley is here as eye candy, a commodity that Raquel Welch displayed to an even greater degree in the original.

At any rate, I found myself chuckling at some of the antics Brendan Fraser has to go through after selling his soul to the luscious Elizabeth Hurley.  Fraser is a game actor, and usually throws himself head first into his role.  This time around he gets to be an obnoxious lonely nerd; a Colombian drug lord; an ultrasensitive man who cries at sunsets and treatment of dolphins; a handsome author with a male lover; a basketball player with no i.q. at all, and even a doomed President.

The DVD offered on this page contains a radical dumbing down of a great film. The great film is ""Bedazzled"" of 1967 by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.  It is a multi-layered delight as well as a deeply insightful variation on one of the most famous legends in Western Civilization:  the man who sells his soul to the devil for (choose any or all of the following) sex, pleasure, riches, power, or to know all things as God knows them.  Cook and Moore, by both word and action, refer back to Marlowe's ""Dr. Faustus,"" to Goethe's ""Faust,"" and even to Hannah Arendt's theory of the ""banality"" of evil with reference to the Holocaust, and they do it with the wacky finesse one associates with Monty Python.  Philosophy, theology, the slapstick of vaudeville, the Irish-accented intellectualism of James Joyce, upper-class Oxbridge-snobbery, the trench-coated detective of the English mystery novel, your grandmother being bilked by traveling salesmen, Raquel Welch playing the Deadly Sin of Lust as if she were Scarlet O'Hara from ""Gone with the Wind,"" puns high and low, and loud, wet ""thhhpts"" of raspberries thhhpt'd in hopeful despair - the 1967 film lacks nothing of humor and insight into the foolish and dangerous desires and yet loving and redeeming intentions of humankind.  Now, the 2000 version -  well, dudes, it's a masterpiece of simple-minded dialogue and cheap sexual imagery.

1293790,4,B00003CXKJ,"In my opinion, Brendan Fraser is one of this country's most underrated actors.

Stop laughing.  Check out ""The Quiet American"" (where he's nothing short of incredible) and ""Gods and Monsters"" (going up and holding his own against Ian McKellen).  Then, he can go completely to other end of the range like the broad comedic skills he puts on display here in ""Bedazzled.""  Of course, it helps that he's directed by Harold Ramis, whose 80s trio of ""Caddyshack"" (sainthood alone for that), ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"" put him in some untouchable comedic pantheon.

I'm not a bid E. Hurley fan, so - unlike some of the other reviewers here - I'll withhold commentary.  You could replace her with anyone, and the effect on the movie would be minor in my mind (well, I'd like to see Maxine Bahns in there, but that's a different thing altogether).

But Fraser - this is a tour de force.  I'll point out one of the seven vignettes that make up this movie: his stint as a basketball player, in which his post-game courtside and locker room interviews savage every cliche and stereotype you've ever seen in those interactions.  When he's standing there with sweat flying off his body (giving new meaning to the term 'profusely') and spouting nothings (over and over) about ""giving 110%""...well, a thing of beauty really.  Someone had a great eye and ear for inanities of those interviews.  It's those gems that make this movie many people's Guilty Pleasure.",1103068800,3,1447,4.841463414634147
1293791,3,B00003CXKJ,"Warning, this contains spoilers:

As a fan of the 1967 original from Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore (Moore's soundtrack for the movie is worth getting if available, it ROCKS), I didn't know what to expect from Harold Remis - though I was expecting it to be funny and somewhat intelligent.  I think the phrase ""Whoops"" is apropos here.

So what do we get?  An utterly stereotypical computer support dweeb, stupid wiener jokes (and I don't mean Oscar Meyer, this is 2000 America we're speaking about), and more dreary physical comedy that makes me long for the original even more.

The best thing going for this movie are the interim, between-vignettes where the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) does something rotten.  Incidents include swapping patients' drugs with candy (which was actually quite funny), causing a multi-car pile-up (good), and writing tickets for cars after making the parking meters expire (direct rip-off from the original, but welcomed all the same).

Brendan Frazer (who, unlike Hurley, gets top billing) is dreadfully miscast.  Almost fittingly, there's no soul in his performance.  Hurley did a much better job at acting the role of the Devil.  It also helps that she's British, but please don't come to any conclusions about that.  :-)  Also, the supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, who is a much better comic actor than to appear in this flick) are wasted.

One thing that really dragged was that, in the original, when the hapless character wanted out, he'd have to blow a raspberry - often in the most difficult of situations.  This is funny.  What does the guy in the rewrite have to do?  Dial ""666"" on a pager, oh how inventive (not).  This effictively sums up the whole movie:  Mostly unimaginative, with a few surprises.  (since when does a pager have a numeric keypad?!)

And the effects.  This movie was cheaply made while trying to look big.  If one of the all-time dark comedies ever made (1992's 'Death Becomes Her') can look convincing with a reasonable budget, why can't Bedazzled 2000?  (Look not-too-carefully and it's painfully obvious, quite often, that the background and the implanted foreground do not match or look convincing.)  Indeed, the original didn't need to resort to mindless eyecandy, so why does the remake have to?  I will give the vignette where the guy becomes a big (well, mostly, and this harks back to the Oscar Meyer gag) basketball player some credit as it does look mostly convincing, but overall...

Still, I don't watch movies for effects.  I watch them for content.  B-2k is somewhat funny when I least expected it (again, the interim bits though I can say that the Presidential vignette was the funniest), and I did chuckle and have the occasional ROTFL moment, but mostly it is unintelligent and almost stereotypic of a British entity remade in the hands of Americans.  (or a stereotypic American comedy with all the lame male anatomy jokes, fratboy humor, with only a miniscule amount of wit, if any at all.)

Despite it all, I would say this movie IS worth having for $5 or maybe $10, but not for much more.  I'd much rather see the original out, but this new remake does have some going for it - especially after the first 45 minutes.  The original is simply more creative, as a whole.  The 2000 update, while having some moments, just isn't as great, but has enough to make it worth renting or getting for a reasonable price.",1100390400,5,3399,4.835355285961872

She dons an assortment of sexy outfits from bikinis to cheerleader costumes and she looks TERRIFIC in all of them!  While I'm not sure how far her acting abilities will take her, that all seems a moot point in this flick.

For those who are fishing for something beyond an eyeful of Hurley, the feature also offers some additional attributes.  For one, we have a comedic rendition of the Faustian myth.  This time around we have Hurley portraying the sexiest Mephistophles ever (OK, technically she plays the Devil herself).  Instead of Margareta we have Alison (played by Frances O'Connor).

Surprisingly enough, the cast does a credible job of creating a pretty funny movie out of what once was a very dark story.  The religious imagery throughout the film is all tounge-in-cheek & is basically a parody of Catholicism.  Beware: this movie is sure to offend a great many right-wing believers.  If you happen to fall into this category then I would not recommend this movie.

The story of Faust used to be a bit of an urban legend that was later penned by Christopher Marlowe.  Later on, in the 19th century a different (and far lengthier) version of the myth was written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  In the 20th century the tale was told for the first time in prose form (instead of poetry), courtesy of one Thomas Mann.

Read someone elses reveiw for the plot, I'm sure it's been explained a thousand times already.
The most annoying thing about the film was Liz Hurly. Her constand bobbing around as she walked was irratating, I dunno what she was thinking, but that was one of the worst performance's i've ever seen by anyone. ... I suppose if your one of her loyal fans who would go to see her do anything for a perv on her, you probably will be distracted by somthing else other then your mind to come to the conclusion shes is doing a terrible job of acting.. I hoep they didn't pay her for that role... and probably the fans of Brendan Frasier are giving out good reveiws because theyd give there right arms to watch him on screen... but for me, sex images don't sell a movie at all. Therefor, the thought that having 2 actors both men and women would go to see for some kind of attraction thing going on, just dosent cut if, espeiclly when it's not funny, the acting is terrible, and again, that annoying bobbing up and down as Liz Hurly walks... what is that??? was it supposed to be funny? well, underline ""supposed to be"" then.

However, given the quality of the cast, led by the always superb Brendan Fraser, with the gorgeous, classy  Frances O'Connor as a perfectly cast love interest, and the masterful direction of Harold Ramis, the movie carries itself.
This is an inspired re-make of the amazing original Pete and Dud movie, which featured sixties/seventies goddess (she still is) Racquel Welch. Having a divine creature like Elizabeth Hurley playing the Devil, especially utilizing a fantasy temptress wardrobe to die for, was a stroke of genius. Liz as a schoolmarm, a nurse, a cheerleader...

The extra features are excellent from the Commentaries (including Liz H.) to the absolutely invaluable Making Of feature, hosted by La Hurley, which suggests that her considerable sex appeal - a huge part of which is her wicked sense of humor - is just a natural function of who she is, rather than something she has to work at projecting, like Britney Spears.
A message to the movie? Yes, pretty much the same as in the original - that happiness cannot come from external trappings. That you have to find your Truth within you, and if you can learn to love yourself, you will automatically be more loveable and more interesting to others, without having to seduce them with money and power. A valid message, which bears endless repetition.
You see? I just showed my sensitive, creative, spiritually aware side... and I got through the whole review without mentioning the impossibly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley's billion dollar legs.... Aaaaargh... CUT",1081641600,2,1675,5.090909090909091
1293991,5,B00003CXKJ,"Way, way too many comparisons to the original version of this film, which is a shame:  BEDAZZLED stands wonderfully and beautifully on its own merits.  Directed by comedic genius Harold Ramis, this is a fast-paced, well-crafted, highly imaginative, hilarious film.  Heck, even my accountant laughs at this one, which is saying something.
Based on the tried and true Faustian theme of selling one's soul to the devil, BEDAZZLED introduces us to hapless Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), whose mediocre existence revolves around getting Alison, an attractive coworker (played by Frances O'Connor) to notice him, let alone go out with him.  In desperation, Elliot offers to sell his soul to obtain Alison's affection, and the devil responds.
But this isn't just any ol' devil.  This is a heart-palpitating, traffic stopping, bark at the moon Elizabeth Hurley, who makes a most lusty Lucifer, and who wears enough revealing outfits to pack a heart trauma center.  Hurley's devil is seductive, playful, and of course delightfully wicked.  She grants Elliot seven wishes to win over Alison, but she's ingenious enough to turn each optimistic wish into a disaster.  For example:  Elliot wishes to be a rich and powerful businessman, married to Alison; the devil grants his wish, only Elliot is a South American drug lord, hated by his wife and under siege from all sides.  Each wish--no matter how carefully Elliot thinks he has covered all the bases--blows up in his face, to the blissful delight of the viewer.
What really impressed me was Fraser himself.  Before seeing this film, I had placed the actor into the Stallone category of mutton heads, but Fraser very pleasantly surprised.  His role required a wide range of diversity--from a blockheaded NBA superstar to an intellectual bestselling author--and Fraser not only pulls it off, he's incredibly funny in the process.  He helps make BEDAZZLED absolutely bedazzling. . .along with Hurley's legs.

She dresses up and flirts in nearly every stereo-typical male fantasy ever conceived.  Now for the other reasons to watch this movie: Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Connor.  They both play many different characters during the course of the film adding some much needed spice.  The first time I saw this I was impressed with Brendan Fraser, again.  See him in the drama ""School Ties"" for a well-rounded appreciation of his skills.  He can play any character, comic or otherwise.  Brendan Fraser carries this film almost exclusviely, with a variety of characters propelling the otherwise average script.  I did say ""almost.""  Frances O'Connor is much more subtle in her character development (a coy glance here, a smooth gesture there) so much so that it nearly goes unnoticed.  Both of their performances are good examples of solid comic acting.  The actual filmmaking is a bit cheesy, but only in a low-budget sense of fun.

This film isn't funny. If you like really cringe-worthy humour, then yeah, you'll be laughing so much, you'll be crying. But it just wasn't funny.
Elizabeth (or Liz, as she'll always be known) Hurley was great in this film. That is, until she opened her mouth, and that English accent was like nails going down a blackboard. Bet the Americans went nuts for the accent though, but I just couldn't look at her and hear the voice.

The movie didn't disappoint.  As you probably already know, Fraser stars as an IT nerd who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil (Hurley) in return for seven wishes so he can get the girl of his dream (O'Connor).  Only five wishes are really played out (not counting the stupid ""I wish I had a Big Mac and Coke"" gimmick), and each one has a funny twist.  Fraser totally excels as his typical funny-as-monkey performance.  The first ""rich and powerful"" wish is by far the best of the five, with a nice make-up job, too.  The others have their funny moments, but all leave something more to be desired by the audience.
Hurley is a bit disappointing.  She looks old and not really that hot.  (The HBO special feature, however, has her looking really attractive, better than in the film itself.)  Frances O'Connor is excellent and adorable, especially at the end.  The three supporting actors are good, too.

It starts with Elliot (Brendon Fraser) who is a big nerd and is madly in love with a co-worker, Alison.  On the night of a horrible day he meets the devil (Elizabeth Hurley).  She gives him 7 wishes, and this is where it just gets downright funny.
I don't want to give away the funny parts, but my favorite scenes have to be where Elliot wants to be ""the most sensitive guy in the world"" after he reads Alison's journal.  The other one is where he wants to be an NBA player - the way they filmed it is great - he looks like he's 7 feet tall.  And the announcers just crack me up.
The last wish or two are not as funny as the first bunch - but overall it was a good movie.  It has a moral, and a slightly different happy ending than expected.  I liked it, my fiance and I both get a kick out of it every time we watch it.",1058140800,,980,3.9390862944162435

1294099,4,B00003CXKJ,"No great philosophical inquiries here.  The remake of ""Bedazzled"" doesn't spend lots of time pondering theological questions about good vs. evil.  The film just gets right to the point:  Sell your soul to the devil, and bad things will happen.  Fortunately, those bad things are quite funny!
Brendan Fraser plays a computer geek alternately mocked and avoided by his co-workers.  He's in love with Alison (Frances O'Connor), another employee at his company who doesn't really remember that he exists although he can name the date and minute of their only conversation.  When a romantically frustrated Elliott comments that he would sell his soul to the Devil to be with Alison, in pops Elizabeth Hurley to ink the phonebook-sized contract on that Faustian bargain.
In exchange for his soul, Elliot receives seven wishes and a pager-like device (""just type in 666"") to get out of any bad situations that arise.  Elliot then sets about wishing to be the type of man that he thinks Alison will want.  Of course, do men EVER really understand what women want?
As the Devil grants him his wishes, things go hilariously wrong.  After wishing to be rich and powerful and married to Alison, Elliot wakes up as a Colombian drug lord.  Later, he wishes to be sensitive and can't stop weeping over the sunset.  Even though you know before Elliot what's caused his wish to go wrong, watching him figure out is terribly funny.
Fraser plays Elliot with delightful confusion.  He responds to one of his Spanish-speaking cohorts in the drug lord sequence by explaining that he can't speak Spanish--but realizes that he's explained his lack of Spanish-speaking ability IN SPANISH.  (We see the English subtitles.)  Fraser's physical transformations add to the comedy--he goes from being a sweating 7-foot tall dumb-as-a-rock basketball star in one segment to an American icon (saving the surprise) in another.
Hurley makes a wonderfully naughty devil.  You can almost believe her when she explains that souls are overrated, useless things, rather like one's appendix--something Elliot won't miss at all.  Her numerous blink-of-an-eye costume changes--all variations on a sexy red and black motify--make her fun to watch.  The chemistry between Hurley and Fraser truly makes ""Bedazzled"" work.
I caught ""Bedazzled"" late one night on HBO, having concluded from the in-theater previews that it wasn't worth the price of admission, and was so charmed that I want the DVD.  A fun treat!",1028851200,4,2463,5.115
1294247,4,B00003CXKJ,"I may be a bit biased in this review, in that I absolutely love Brendan Fraser and, with the exception of ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Dudley Do-Right,"" have adored every movie he's been in. But even so, I'm writing this review.
I'll admit I have not seen the original version of ""Bedazzled"" that this movie was based on, so I don't have anything to compare this to. ""Bedazzled"" is NOT the best film ever; it's not going to win any Oscars and there sure isn't a guy on a ship shouting ""I'm the King of the World!"" But it's a cute movie and it'll make you laugh at *least* once. I know I couldn't stop laughing through the whole thing.
What impressed me most about ""Bedazzled"" was the make-up. Brendan Fraser gets to play 6 different characters and he looks like a different person when doing each one. He goes from looking remarkably like Oded Fehrer (his co-star in ""The Mummy) while playing a Colombian drug lord, to being a blonde, seven-foot-tall basketball player (who is a little short on brains and a little small in the ummm... private area).
Besides the great make-up, it's also a cute little story with only a few cliches, and I enjoyed the ending just because the lead character did not end up with the woman he wanted - he ended up with someone better.
The other actors in this movie did well also - Elizabeth Hurley made a pretty good devil (though I don't think I'll ever be very impressed with her acting abilities... luckily all she had to do was pout and act sexy in this movie) and I was dazzled (pun intended!) with the African American actor who played God. In fact, I'd recommend seeing the movie JUST for his part!
The only complaint I have is that Brendan Fraser's character goes from being a ridiculed geek at the beginning and then suddenly, after going through all his wishes and ""defeating"" the devil, he becomes Mr. Cool. Granted, these experiences *might* change him a little, but it was treated with a sort of vagueness that bothered me. But that is easy to overlook and it's the only flaw.

After slowly moving up the ladder in Encino Man (1992), George of the Jungle (1997) and the Mummy, Brendan Fraser is perfect as Elliot, a nerdy computer technician who sells his soul to the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) to win the heart of Alison (Francis O'Connor).
The film is essentially a series of sketches joined together by a flimsy plot. But the ideas for Elliot's wishes are great, and here is where Fraser really gets to explore his wide range of comedic abilities.
Liz Hurley is suitably seductive and sexy, but provides little for the film, letting Fraser take over and go crazy with some great gags and one-liners.
But regardless of how great Fraser is, Director Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyse This) doesn't quite succeed in wrapping things up at the ending, which screams, ""Is that it?""
But it's fun and there are some great jokes and just enough genuine laughs to cover the film's flaws. Not quite dazzling, but inventive fun.",1019001600,,1050,4.838888888888889

One day as the female coworker of his dreams passes by, Elliot mutters those fateful words ""I'd give my soul..."" and up pops a gorgeous version of the devil with a contract for seven wishes. She talks Elliot into signing and that's when all the fun begins.
My Opinion: I didn't know quite what to expect going into Bedazzled. I was pleasantly surprised once the seven wishes started. Each one puts Brendan in a completely different and twisted situation. He shines in each one. Hurley is devilishly hot as a not so evil devil. She lights up every scene she is in. Gabriel Casseus make a guest appearance and is excellent. The story was well done. Each of the wishes had a point and they were entertaining and fun. The tone of the movie is lighthearted. Elliot is taught a lesson and we get to learn along with him. The removed Rock Star scene, which is included on the DVD, shows a much darker turn that the movie could have taken. I was glad it was removed.  In the end I was entertained and enjoyed the movie. I liked the message that we all make our own choices. You are free to make yours, but I'd recommend you check out Bedazzled.

What You Should Do:  Check this movie out. Brendan Fraser is very funny and Elizabeth Hurley very hot. It's a lighthearted comedy with a heart well worth watching. You just might want to add it to your collection when you're done.

1294253,4,B00003CXKJ,"BEDAZZLED is an enjoyable movie experience, thanks to the smart writing and the terrific performances of Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. The story is not new but this film has smart, funny dialogue (even poignant near the end). Hurley clearly relishes in her black-comedic role as ""The Devil"", while Fraser plays 7 different characters, and is very funny in all of them.
Brendan Fraser plays a nebbish named Elliot who annoys everyone he works with as he lacks any real social skill and always tries too hard to be everyone's friend (which makes me wonder how he ever got through both high school and college, but never mind such questions while you're watching this). He has a major crush on this girl Alison, who barely evens notices him.  When he proclaims ""I'd give my soul for her!"", of course good ol' Beelzebub appears to him in the form of--Elizabeth Hurley. At first Elliot doesn't believe that this gorgeous woman in the red dress is the devil (which leads to a funny scene where she hands him her card which just simply says ""The Devil""--which is an obvious tip of the hat to the 1977 George Burns-John Denver film ""Oh, God!"", where Burns hands Denver a card on which is simply printed ""God"").
When Hurley finally does convince Elliot, and Elliot reluctantly agrees to the Faustian bargain (on the premise that Alison will be all his), that's when the fun really begins. I won't give away any more of the film other than the fact that BEDAZZLED illustrates the old Chinese saying, ""Be careful what you wish for--you might just get it"" really well!

Saying that, 'Bedazzled' isn't awful, it's just unspectacular.  It's mostly about wish fulfilment gone wrong.  Think of this as 'Wishmaster' for pre-teens.
Fraser is good value as geek, intellectual, gay, sports star etc. whilst Elizabeth Hurley hides herself behind an array of different outfits hoping that no-one will notice that she can't act.  That said, she is the most entertaining person in the movie because she is so funny.  This is half due to the script and half due to her dubious acting ability.
Each nightmarish (or about as nightmarish as a '12' rated movie can get) scenario is amusing.  This will keep you watching but it won't keep you entertained.

Dweebish Elliot, marvelously played by Brendan Fraser, trades his soul to the Devil for seven wishes.  The twist here is that each wish lands Elliot in a whole different world - Columian drug lord, NBA star, etc.  In each scenario Fraser basically creates a whole new character, and principal members of the supporting cast also appear in revamped personas.  Not only is it an impressive show of the actors' versitility, but it makes for a very funny movie.  As funny as all the different wish lives are, the best parts of the movie are the connecting scenes where Elliot and the Devil plan the next wish.  Elizabeth Hurley has a wonderful time as the Devil, and this is the perfect vehicle for her wicked sense of humor.

1294404,4,B00003CXKJ,"This film is a lot better than Fraser's previous work: Dudley Do-Right, Blast from the Past, and Monkeybone.  As I watched those past comedic monsters, I felt a little sorry for Fraser.  It wasn't his fault those movies suffered, and yet he often got the bad rap for their failures.  Bedazzled gives Fraser good direction (courtesy of Ramis), a decent screenplay (by Ramis, Peter Tolan, and Larry Gelbhart), and talented co-stars (you won't see Alicia Silverstone on the cast list) to work off of, and Fraser is at the top of his game, proving to be a real comedic talent.
Bedazzled follows the overused but always appealing movie premise of man who sells his soul to the devil.  In this film, the man is Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) an irritating, unpopular office worker who won't stop trying to make friends with his annoyed co-workers (Toby Huss, Miriam Shor, Paul Adelstein, and Orlando Jones) until they are forced to flat-out reject him.  To make Elliot's situation even more pathetic, the object of his nerdy passions, Alison (Frances O'Connor) isn't interested in him at all.  As Alison politely brushes him off in a bar, he mutters under his breath ""Man, I'd do anything to have that girl in my life.""  Poof The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) appears and promises to grant Elliot seven wishes if he sells his soul.  He agrees and the fun begins as we watch each of Elliot's wishes, centered around his desire for Alison, become sabotaged by the Devil.  For instance, wishing to be rich, powerful, and married to Alison, Elliot is turned into a Colombian drug lord, and his wife, a Latin version of Alison, is cheating on him.  His second wish to be the world's most sensitive man turns out to be a disaster as a blonde Alison finds his undying devotion boring.
I got a kick out of watching these very gifted comedic actors transform their personalities and their physical appearances as they go from wish to wish.  Fraser, O'Connor, and the co-workers each play six different characters, while Elizabeth Hurley has to endure countless costume and hair changes as many as five times during a single scene.
Fraser, Adelstein, Jones, and especially Toby Huss are hilarious (his mumbling sportscaster and token gay guy are the highlights of the film) Ramis competently directs; Elizabeth Hurley shows off impressive range (if she chose more dramatic roles, I think she would surpise a lot of people) and O'Connor is an engaging love interest.  What this adds uip to is a thoroughly watchable and occasionally very clever movie.",997488000,2,2531,4.874125874125874

It stars Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley, two dramatically different people who amazingly go together in this funky flick. Elizabeth Hurley plays the devil-a perfect part for her considering her English accent and deep sexy looks. Brendan Fraser plays a dumb office worker, Eliot, (with no idea how much his co-workers hate him) who is crushing on Alison, a pretty girl co-worker who, unfortunaltey, is engaged. When the Devil approches him with a deal to sell his soul for three wishes, Eliot eats it up. He finds that the Devil finds holes in his wishes, and makes him miserable. In the end, he gets arrested, and ends up meeting God himself. It all turns out ok. Plus, he meets Nicole, a great match for him. A great family comedy, even if it's rated PG-13.

1294643,2,B00003CXKJ,"In the inaptly named ""Bedazzled"" - a virtually laughless remake of a 1967 Peter Cook/Dudley Moore comedy - the old Faust legend takes one of its severest beatings ever.  I've seen the original film only once before - at a revival theatre in the mid `70's - and remember finding it to be a fresh, original and occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious British comedy.  Unfortunately, none of those adjectives can be applied to this newest version, which strands Brandan Fraser and the stunning Elizabeth Hurley in 90-minutes worth of repetitious humorless nonsense.
Strike one against this film is that it is basically a one-joke concept stretched out to be a full length feature film - sort of like a 90-minute version of a mediocre ""Bewitched"" episode.  Hopelessly nerdy Elliot (Fraser) - who is such an overbearing geek that his coworkers are forced to run and hide when he comes in their vicinity - makes an idle wish one day to be with the beautiful young woman he loves and yearns for from afar.  Enter Hurley as the devil who takes Elliot in hand, promising him that he will be granted seven wishes on the understanding that his soul will be required as final payment.  What Elliot doesn't understand is that making a bargain with the ""Father of Lies"" - even if in the guise of a beautiful woman - virtually guarantees that each wish will, in some way, fall far short of securing him total happiness.
Since the 1967 original managed to make a genuinely funny comedy out of the very same material, we must assume that the failure of this version lies not in the premise but in the execution.  So where did this particular group of filmmakers go wrong?  Part of the problem may lie in the fact that Brandan Fraser, though a likable enough actor on the surface, is hardly a gifted subtle comedian on the level of Dudley Moore.  Elizabeth Hurley, easily one of the most stunningly gorgeous actresses working in films today, looks sensational in the part of the temptress and she does convey a certain sly sexiness that might have worked if the jokes had simply been funnier.  Here too is part of the problem - the weakness of the script.  The scrapes Elliot inadvertently wishes himself into are simply not very imaginative or humorous.  One of the funniest sequences I have ever seen in a film actually occurs in the original ""Bedazzled,"" when Moore finds himself stranded in a convent filled with nuns bouncing on trampolines.  This film could have used a few bouncing nuns I think.  Instead, Elliot's adventures come across as hopelessly mundane in their nature and, even worse, the caricatures he is called upon to act out in many of the scenes border nearly on the grotesque.  Perhaps, Jim Carey might have been able to pull this part off.  Fraser just seems stranded way over his head during much of the film.
You know you're in trouble when, as a viewer, you begin to count off how many wishes the main character has already used up.  If it weren't for the eye-candy provided by Ms. Hurley, ""Bedazzled"" would truly be hell on Earth.  As it is, it seems more like purgatory.  Now if only we could figure out which sins we are being forced to atone for.  If I knew, I promise I would stop committing them immediately.",994550400,7,3220,4.657243816254417
1294644,3,B00003CXKJ,"This is a real fun movie. Basically what happens is, Eliot (played by Brendan Fraiser) is a lonley, geeky loser who will do anything for a love of his life.

There were a lot of holes in the plot, however. If one wish can be used to make you life okay, and to go back and mak another wish, it removes the other wish away from you, than why were there 7 wishes? He also seemed to fit several wishes in to one. Another thing I would ask, is why didn't Eliot just take his first wish and bulid on that? He erases every previous wish, and gets on with the next one. And why didn't he wish for his next wish to work out for him?

1294651,4,B00003CXKJ,"Elizabeth Hurley was an ideal choice for the role of Satan in ""Bedazzled,"" opposite Brendan Fraser, who is also well cast as a misfit who offers his soul in return for seven wishes. The movie is a remake of an original film, and while it may tend to drag down a bit in its final acts, the result is a comedy tour-de-force which had me laughing and feeling pleased throughout.
What more pathetic character could we ask for in Elliott, the computer technician with no life? Elliott has no friends, but that doesn't stop him from conversing with his coworkers whom he thinks are actually listening. When his attention becomes snagged by fellow coworker Allison, her rejection brings him to the attention of a mysterious woman in red who reveals herself to be the Princess of Darkness. Her plan: to offer him seven wishes in return for his soul, and while he remains skeptical, the thought of being with Allison (with the help of Satan's television screens) drives him to accept the offer.
This is where the movie gets good, as we follow him on his many adventures accompanying each of his wishes. His first wish, to be rich and have Allison for his wife, lands him as a Spanish cocaine dealer whose wife is cheating on him with her English teacher, followed by his second wish to be emotionally sensitive, which drives Allison into the arms of a shallow man (""I just want someone who wants to get in my pants""). Elliott soon catches on to Satan's tricks, yet still keeps taking his wishes, with hilarious results.
First and foremost, the performances from Hurley and Fraser are what make the movie worthwhile. Brendan Fraser looks like he's having so much fun playing his role, segueing from a fast-talking Mexican who speaks multiple languages, to the overtly sensitive red-haired boy who bursts into tears at the glance of the sunset. Hurley gives a smashing performance as a female Satan, her accent adding wit and charisma to a role that is being dealt with in a new way. In watching ""Bedazzled,"" I could see how much fun the two actors were having in playing their roles, which made the movie more enjoyable and the comedy more comfortable.
That comedy arises from many different things: first, there's the relationship between the two characters. Satan knows that she's not going to live up to her promises entirely without flaw, which leads to some very funny results as Elliott discovers each wish's put-off. I also found a great many laughs during the opening sequence, which singles people out in the frantic pace of life and labels them with a certain flaw. Add a bit of witty dialogue and a goofy character on his way to his dreams, and what you've got is a reasonably successful film which delivers what it was intended to: laughs.
Which is why the ending, for me, doesn't quite live up to the rest of the material. The laughs seem to fizzle out a bit: they're still a couple of chuckle-worthy moments at hand, but not on par with the hysterics of the first two thirds of the movie. I originally intended to dispute the way in which the movie ""cops out"" by taking the approach it does in the end, but once I thought about it (and you'll understand me when you watch it yourself), there really was no other way for it to end and still retain a certain lightheartedness.
On a slightly off-the-subject opinion, I also felt that the film had a good advertising plan going for it. The preview trailers don't give away all the laughs, and the movie takes certain turns that we don't get to see in the ads.
All-in-all, ""Bedazzled"" is a regular comedy made just a touch better by the bright and vivacious performances of its leads. The fun they have in creating their characters' body and verbal language is laugh-out-loud funny, while the situations they find themselves in aren't original, but still have comedic charm.",989798400,,3823,4.673590504451038

Unfortunatly, the film just doesnt work. Maybe its that Elliot is so naive that after each wish goes wrong he still keeps wishing! Although the film is worth seeing for Fraser's brilliant comedy and Liz Hurleys collection of red revealing outfits.

Despite the fact that Fraser isn't really a nerdy type at all, he's gives just the right amount of hesitation and lack of self confidence to pull it off. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job.
I can't say the same for Elizabeth Hurley. Her devil is second rate, even though some of her scenes are well written (whenever Frasier meets her, she's doing something evil, making parking meters run out early, putting m&m's in for drugs at a hospital etc.), she just doesn't convince me.
Fasier on the other hand is a genius. Despite the mediocrity of the rest of the film, this is a must for any Brendan Fraser fan. He's great in all his incarnations, the nerd, the Colombian drug lord (his Spanish and Russian are flawless), the super basketball player and especially the most sensitive guy in the world.

He deserves a better script than this.
The jokes are predictable, the plot is thin, Fraser's character is moronic instead of sympathetic (Hollywood seems to think that ""ordinary guy"" is synonymous with ""idiot""), and the few minutes of fortune cookie philosophy thrown in near the end feels like an afterthought from somebody who never gave the afterlife much thought.

Score: 71/100
Bedazzled is further proof that dark fairly tales need not come under the name of Walt Disney. The film is like an adult version of 7 wishes from the soul catcher, a remake of the old 1967 favourite. As it may not be as plausible as the original, this is still darned good stuff, a highly recommendable piece of comedic viewing.
Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), a socially incompetent technical advisor working at a call-center, has had a crush on Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor) for nearly four years. One evening, which already started particularly bad for Elliot, she ditches him. Elliot wishes for her to be in his life with all his heart - and is heard. An incredibly beautiful young lady addresses Elliot, and after introducing herself as the Devil, Lucifer, the Princess of Darkness (Elizabeth Hurley), she offers him a deal: Seven wishes for him, his Soul for her. Quickly, Elliot is convinced and accepts. But every wish he gets fulfilled has massive disadvantages as well, and soon Elliot wants to get out of the contract. The only thing that matters to him now is being able to take his chances by himself.
Indeed, Bedazzled is not the perfect film. It drags on towards the end, the jokes are sometimes largely unfunny and some of the humour is just typical. But, you can't resist Elizabeth Hurley in some very revealing clothes. She is excellent as The Devil, it's official that she has never been this good since Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Brendan Fraser is almost as good as her, it's easy to say he has lots of comedic talent, he does a great job of playing six different characters, each get caught in horridly embarrassing situations. There are also some very clever scenes to boost the film, including one of the scenes where Elliot awakes from his wish, and Hurley's shaded character is `teaching' a class, and there is a greatly funny act in which Elliot wishes to be the most sensitive man in the world...
Bedazzled is a surprisingly above-average picture, far from perfect, but way away from bad, and it is to be as genuinely enjoyed as the first film.",985651200,,2127,4.751351351351351
1294942,4,B00003CXKJ,"Liz is incredible, and I'll never understand why she was with that phony Hugh.  Try to sit through the original version of Bedazzled and you'll appreciate her presence.  No one's looked this hot since Jane Fonda in 'Barbarella' and now Jennifer Love Hewitt in 'Heartbreakers.'  Two warnings: the scenes where she is in a French Maid's outfit and where she has a snake around her in a bikini, from the previews, are unfortunately missing from the movie or the extras.  The most it shows are flashes of those scenes during interviews.  This big disappointment makes it a better rental than purchase.  Hopefully the DVD of 'Heartbreakers' will include the scene with Jen on the treadmill, which is also noticeably missing from that movie.  Don't make the same mistake this DVD made.",985651200,,779,4.900763358778626
1294943,3,B00003CXKJ,"Bedazzled is the perfect movie if you want to watch something fun and amusing.  Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley both give good performances here, Fraser's being particularly good as he gets to play several different types of characters (all the same guy in totally different situations).  While this will not go down as a ""classic,"" it is still an enjoyable movie to watch - and re-watch.  The Columbian drug lord bit was HYSTERICAL!!  Several of the other sequences were great as well (the basketball bit, the ""writer"" bit).  The only one that didn't work as well was the ""Mr. Sensitive"" sequence, and it still had a couple of good lines.  The transformation in Fraser's character is particularly good.  From a total geek in the beginning to a more self confident guy at the end (although still a little bit of a geek), Fraser's performance really shines.  If you want something with real depth, skip Bedazzled.  If you just want a fun, lighthearted movie to watch then Bedazzled is just what you're looking for.",985478400,4,1017,4.832369942196531
1294944,5,B00003CXKJ,"Elizabeth Hurley is much MUCH better as the devil than Peter Cook was. Although Dudley Moore was probably more pathetic than Brendan Fraser, Fraser was still pretty good. I think some of the other reviews were unnecessarily harsh. Who would you rather have granting you 7 wishes, dopey Peter Cook, or the ultra sexy Liz Hurley? I watch movies to enjoy myself. Whether they're actions films, comedies, and yes even romances. I don't look for the meaning of life in a movie and I guess I'm petty easy to please. Also I think Leonard Maltin is a bit on the whiny side. ""remake...never catches fire."" I bet he didn't like the first one either. Anyway, if you're in the mood to laugh a little and ogle at Liz Hurley being a really bad girl (and I strongly believe that there is nothing wrong with this), this is the movie for you.",985305600,6,825,4.470198675496689

1294946,4,B00003CXKJ,"Ok..so it isn't Mrs. Doubtfire or Scary Movie, but it has something, or should I say someone, Mr. Fraser.  If you read the other critiques, you'll know the basic plot:  Man wants woman and sells his soul for seven wishes which get twisted by beautiful person known as Satan.
I don't think I could suggest that you purchase this movie unless you are a true blue fan of any of the actors/actresses or the director.  The players played a good game with some geeky dialogue.  HOWEVER, I feel Mr. Fraser did an outstanding job playing seven different ""characters"" within one film (if Eddie Murphy can receive credit for doing this, why shouldn't Brendan???)
Rent it just to see if you like it.  My friend was rather pleased when we saw it in the theatre.  He thought he would hate it.  Let me state this final thought, though, if you enjoy Brendan Fraser in other films, you must see him in ""Gods and Monsters.""  He aptly shows his acting ability in this film without flaw.",984787200,2,968,4.522988505747127

1295077,4,B00003CXKJ,"In 2000, Harold Ramis (know by many as Egon Spengler in the Ghostbusters movies) released a funny and clever film called Bedazzled. Itself a remake of a 1968 Dudley Moore film of the same name, Ramis' Bedazzled stars Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley as dueling mortal and devil. The film shows that Ramis still had the skills to make very funny films, but it also helped showcase Fraser as a comedic leading man. But the film's scene-stealing performance has to be that of leading lady Elizabeth Hurley as a feminine-personafied Satan.

The film has a simple enough premise. Fraser plays one Elliot Richards. He is a nebbish and socially-inept drone at a software company in San Francisco whose unrequited and secret crush for a beautiful co-worker leads him into the the ravishingly beautiful arms of the Prince of Darkness. Well, in this case it would be the Princess of Darkness. After a night where he's embarrassed and ridiculed by co-workers, Elliot makes an ill-fated wish to be able to love his secret love, Alison (played by Frances O'Connor) and willing to sell his soul to have it so. Thus enters Satan in all her sinfully glory.

Playing Satan is British beauty Elizabeth Hurley who takes the role of Satan and runs with it. Her performance as the Devil is one that anyone, male or female, would easily sell and damn their souls for. It's a star-turning performance that really keeps the audience from starying from their seats. Ms. Hurley never looked more beautiful than she did in Bedazzled. Brendan Fraser more than holds his own against the tour-de-force that's Ms. Hurley's performance and there's definite chemistry between the two actors. In fact, their chemistry is so palpable that by film's end one would rather Elliot and the She-Devil end up together than with Alison. One funny thing I noticed was that in every scene Ms. Hurley was in she had a different outfit everytime. Each and every one more revealing and sexy than the next. Worth the price of admission, at the least.

The film itself uses the seven wishes Satan grants to Elliot as a way to give Fraser many different personas to show his acting and comedic chops. One wish has him becoming a very powerful and rich man who happens to be a drug-lord. Another has him being a loving and sensitive man who happens to be so sensitive that he's become almost female. He even wishes to be a famous and talented athlete and thus becomes one but lacking ""size"" where it counts. All these wishes puts a new spin on the saying ""be careful what you wish for"" and each wish gets mined for comedy gold at every turn. One thing I'd like to point out would be the funny performance of Orlando Jones as one of Elliot's co-workers who also end up appearing as someone else in each of his wishes. If it wasn't for Elizabeth Hurley's performance, Orlando Jones would be the one stealing each and every scene he's in.

All in all, Bedazzled was a very good film that was kept from becoming too campy and episodic with its set-pieces by the performances of Hurley, Fraser and Jones. Ramis may have slowed down abit in the last decade or so with his filmmaking but this film shows that he's lost none of his skills in crafting a funny, clever and, ultimately, entertaining film that aspires for nothing else but to be that.",984528000,,3290,4.667241379310345
1295078,3,B00003CXKJ,"I saw this movie in the theaters, and I can't stress enough what a snoozfest this movie is.  I'm sure you all know what it's about so I'm not gonna write out the whole plot.  The only reason I stayed awake during this movie was for some of the sexy outfits Elizabeth Hurly wore.  But other than that, this movie is terribly written, the only funny are what you see in the trailers, do yourself a favor, save yourself some money and don't buy this.",984528000,2,447,4.235294117647059
1295079,4,B00003CXKJ,"This movie is what it claims to be.  It's a funny, simple film about a guy wishing to be what he thinks will make him happy.  This comes with a good, old fashioned lesson about being who we are and all that.....  I would have given this film a 3, but the incredible performances of both Fraser (Encino Man, Gods and Monsters) and Hurley (Austin Powers, Permanent Midnight) make me really like this movie.
Fraser is perfect as the lovable loser Elliot.  His geeky personality is painful to watch and makes you route for some intervention, even the devil.  When his wishes take turns for the worse is when Fraser is really showing a lot of comedic talent.  He ability to show the different personas with the changes is great fun.
Hurley is as about as sexy as the devil can be.  She makes all the horrible things she does seem a little more fun.  You may want to own this one.  It's worth having for when you have friends over.",984441600,2,925,4.362573099415204

1295081,3,B00003CXKJ,"This is an innocuous and mildly amusing remake of a 1967 comedy formerly starring Dudley Moore.  Since I haven't seen the original, I will comment on this film on its own merits.  The story is a lighthearted Faustian parody where a geek named Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) sells his soul to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes.  Consistent with the maxim, ""Be careful what you wish for"", Elliot's wishes bring him numerous unintended and droll consequences.
Harold Ramis has written and directed some classic comedies (""Animal House"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""Groundhog Day""), but this material comes nowhere near the standard set by his earlier films.  The film is a showcase for Brendan Fraser, who is funny, but not hilarious.
Fraser's performance is hit or miss.  Some of his portrayals are very humorous and some fall flat.  He is better when he is playing the sincere buffoon than when he is trying to render some bizarre caricature.  Not much is asked of Elizabeth Hurley (""Austin Powers"") by this screenplay.  She needed to be beautiful, sexy and naughty, which isn't much of a stretch for her.  Frances O'Connor (""Mansfield Park"") has an equally undemanding role as Elliot's love interest, being more of an object than an integral part of the film.  Some of the funniest performances are given by the supporting actors especially Orlando Jones and Paul Adelstein.
This film is good for some light entertainment.  I rated it a 6/10.  There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",983577600,2,1522,4.996031746031746
1295082,4,B00003CXKJ,"""Bedazzled"" was a definite fun movie for me, but without the presence of the charismatic, truly dynamic Liz Hurley, this film would have been valueless.
The plot is minimal, but in a sort of tv sitcom way, holds your interest. Brendan Frasier plays Elliot Richards, a geeky guy who just wants to be liked and win the girl of his dreams.
The casting of Allison is a major problem, as is her acting, and detracts from the film's value.
Also odd is the large number of stereotypes perpetuated in this film-like Columbian drug lords, broadway loving gay people and much more. But it wasn't offensive, merely ignorant.
But I digress, this film is a reasonable comedy, and decidedly entertaining!",983404800,,690,4.80672268907563

1295085,3,B00003CXKJ,"Brendan Fraser's Brilliant Comedic Timing and Elizabeth Hurley's Adequet Comedic Timing save this film from being a Comedy Dead Zone.

Unfortunately, that is Exactly what this film, and thats fine, but with Ticket Prices as high as they are, you may want to wait for Video and DVD.
There are a few Laugh out loud moments and Liz gets into a few great outfits, but all-round, the laughs are few and far between. As for the ending.. Well, it is nearly a movie killer. The Laughs stop dead, for nearly the last half an hour, and that is unacceptable. It is a silly, calculated, contrived and downright stupid ending that makes you forget all the good stuff before it.
