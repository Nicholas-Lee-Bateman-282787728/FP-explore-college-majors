3509167,5,B001CDFY4Q,"If you liked the first two then this is no different, he talks about having hemroids and jury duty. The making of clerks 2 and so on but if you like a good story then sit back and get ready to laugh till it hurts",1228003200,,212,3.7333333333333334
3509168,5,B001CDFY4Q,"I really enjoyed this DVD, although it was not quite as good as the first two, the first one being my favorite, but it was still highly entertaining. You can never go wrong with Kevin Smith. Also check out Zack and Miri Make a Porno in theaters now!!!",1228003200,,251,4.25
3509169,3,B001CDFY4Q,"I am probably the world's biggest Kevin Smith fan.  I own everything he has released on DVD or in print.  Given that, it is with a heavy heart that I say this one is not as good as the two previous incarnations.  It's good, especially if you haven't read his books or listened to his smodcast.  For the diehard, though, there is precious little new material.
One of the things that made his previous ""Evening With..."" discs so wonderful was seeing his interactions with the crowd -- beyond just the regular Q and A, such as dealing with hecklers, making phone calls to bosses, etc.  There's none of this.  No particularly interesting questioners, and not much (in 5 hours)in the way of movie making anecdotes -- most of the good stuff comes in the ""special features"" on disc 2.  There's plenty of ""TMI"" (too much information) moments, so be warned.  It's a decent disc, but if you had to pick, I'd go for Evening 1 and 2, in that order.",1227225600,14,936,4.464705882352941
3509170,5,B001CDFY4Q,"what else can be said except a great movie, Kevin has a presence on stage ive never seen before.",1227052800,,96,4.105263157894737
3509171,5,B001CDFY4Q,"While the prospect of a director rattling on and on for a few hours captured on DVD may make many viewers at the very least wary, the simple fact is that Kevin Smith often proves most interesting and most humanly vulnerable when telling his stories to an audience of his devotees. Following in the footsteps of his previous two ""Evening With"" offerings, ""Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith"" offers much of the same - which makes it an essential view for fans of both his work and of the spoken word/stand-up genre as a whole. Smith's stories are captivating throughout because, aside from their interesting subject matter, the viewer never gets the impression that he is selling you any embellishments along the way.

Even if Smith never gets the credit he deserves for his body of film work, this DVD release (along with its other two counterparts) should always remain part of the lexicon for years to come.",1225756800,,915,4.754716981132075
3509172,4,B001CDFY4Q,"I am a pretty big fan of Kevin Smith.  I listen to his and Scott Mosier's Free Podcast (called Smodcast) fairly regularly.  I own the other Q&A DVDs, and I have really enjoyed most of his movies.

When I got ""Threevening,"" I was expecting that it would be a little bit more ""manufactured"" for DVD than the other DVDs solely based on the fact that it is the third installment and, obviously, now it is more of a money-making venture than the first Q&A DVD that paid off nicely. The first and arguably second DVDs seemed to be much more organic in the sense that the filming was of Smith doing a true Q&A format, actually answering questions (though, in a long and winding way) and conducting the events not to produce, market, and sell a DVD, but to actually answer peoples' questions.

When you watch ""Threevening"" it is pretty apparent that the events were organized (staged?) for the sole purpose of maximizing the profitability of DVD sales and not to genuinely answer fans' questions.  It's very easy to picture a group of straight-to-DVD production company executives sitting in a room watching and re-watching the first two DVDs so that they can re-create in ""Threevening"" what made the first two DVDs sell so well and then give Smith a bullet-point list of things he needs to do during the show as per his contract with the DVD filming and production company. If the implied obviousness isn't enough, Smith makes a few references to the ""DVD [being filmed]"" in the DVD itself.

Also, instead of answering questions, he just seems to recite a prepared stand-up act (though, still funny) regardless of the participants' question.  Of course, he adapts the very beginning and very end of the 10 minute stand-up bit to relate back to the question, but again, as I said, it's obvious that this is just a staged attempt to produce another profitable Q&A DVD in an easy format.

Finally, many (not all, but many) of the stories he tells in the Q&A are nearly verbatim from past Smodcasts or in his GREAT book ""Silent Bob Speaks,"" such as the ""Shecky"" story and the ""Anal Fissures"" story.  There are some elements that he didn't cover in the Smodcast version of the story, but all the funny parts are generally there.  There are new stories in ""Threevening,"" but if you have listened to the free-to-download Smodcasts, watching (and buying) ""Threevening"" makes you feel kind of gypped given that this old/free material dominates anything new.

With all this said, I still think Smith is very funny, and given that ""Threevening"" and the other Q&A DVDs are extremely long and entertaining, and still only cost about $14 shipped, this is a solid DVD and worth purchasing if you're a Smith fan.

If you aren't a big Kevin Smith fan but want to check him out, I would start with the earlier ""Evening with Kevin Smith"" DVDs and then move on to this one.  You won't be sorry.",1225756800,22,2867,4.6646825396825395
3509173,5,B001CDFY4Q,"Kevin Smith's honesty, humor and fantastic story telling abilities make this a thoroughly enjoyable viewing. Of course, being familiar with his movies helps with certain references and stories, I don't think you have to have seen or liked any of them to enjoy any of his ""Evening With's"" - all of which I recommend. Still not sure? Just type his name in a YouTube search for a taste of the greatness that is ""Moves"".",1225152000,2,416,4.635135135135135
3509224,2,B001CDFY4Q,I bought this movie and it was delivered earlier then expected which was great. But the CD case was stained with something nasty and definitely faulty. The movie also had a delayed response when people were talking.  You would see the lips moving but It would take a couple seconds to catch up to the dialog for you to hear.,1405641600,,324,4.4
3509225,5,B001CDFY4Q,"Well, Kevin Smith is fantastic as always. I am a huge fan of his podcasts and this is basically a 4 hour live podcast. Wonderful and hilarious.",1398816000,,143,4.333333333333333
3509226,5,B001CDFY4Q,I love hearing Kevin smith speak!! I will listen to this over and over.  If you love the first 2 you will love this one.,1367193600,2,120,3.8
3509227,4,B001CDFY4Q,"I wouldn't say this is bad, far from it, but it's not nearly as good as ""Too fat for 40"" or any of the other evening with DVD's. Check those out first and wait for this until last.",1333670400,,180,3.763157894736842
3509228,4,B001CDFY4Q,"I don't think it was as great as the other two but it is certainly better than nothing.

Pros: It is another two disc package of Kevin Smith rambling on for 20 minutes when a yes or no answer would have worked.

Cons: It is more obvious this time around that he had stories he wanted tell and it didn't matter what the question was.

So again, if you liked the other two Kevin Smoth Evenings, buy it. If you didn't, don't.",1296691200,,422,4.121951219512195
3509229,5,B001CDFY4Q,"I own the other two DVDs with his shows and this one is just as good, waiting for the next one to come out on DVD after seeing it on EPIX.  The extras are great on this DVD with more Kevin Smith stories.",1291161600,,203,3.7209302325581395
3509230,5,B001CDFY4Q,"This was pretty funny!

If you're a fan of Kevin Smith's stories you'll enjoy watching this for about 2 hours.  True he recycles the ""Moves"" story in this one but it's still funny as Hell!  Watching this is like sitting at home with some of your friends just chatting and hanging out.  Plus the behind the scenes stories of Clerks 2 were worth the money to get this DVD set.

Pick this one up!",1290211200,2,393,4.256756756756757

3509232,5,B001CDFY4Q,I bought this DVD for my son who is 22 and in college (shipped directly to him).  It is not the kind of movie I would normally watch and I have not seen it.  My son said he watched it and enjoyed it.,1286236800,,199,3.604651162790698
3509233,5,B001CDFY4Q,"We loved Kevin Smith's, Birthday bash. It was a whole lot of fun. We look forward to showing it to our friends! And he answers some questions we all have been dying to know! So sit back and enjoy the show!",1280534400,,205,4.024390243902439
3509254,3,B001CDFY4Q,"Not as good as his other ""A Night with..."" projects, but I'd rather listen to Kevin Smith blather than any other contemporary filmmaker.  He is more insightful, more real, funnier and less full of himself than any of his counterparts.",1279843200,,234,4.85
3509255,5,B001CDFY4Q,Product was in excellent condition and the seller got it yo me much faster then expected!!,1275177600,,90,4.6875
3509256,5,B001CDFY4Q,"Up there on par with the other 2 Kevin Smith live shows, highly recommend for Kevin Smith fans",1269648000,,94,4.277777777777778
3509257,5,B001CDFY4Q,"Came in perfect condition, with no blemishes and perfect playback.  Great price and shipping speed as well!",1267574400,,107,5.294117647058823
3509258,5,B001CDFY4Q,"I am a big Kevin Smith fan, and the first Evening with Kevin Smith is my favorite work by the guy by far. I prefer it to his movies (which, have gotten crappier and crappier recently...blasphemy, I know!). I think the second EWKS was a step down, but this one is almost right up there with his first. It's absolutely hilarious and I highly recommend it.

If you're not a Smith fan, I don't know why you would even be reading reviews for this. However, if you somehow are, let me say if you don't mind a lot of profanity and graphic descriptions of sex acts then you will find this hilarious even if you aren't familiar with his work, or if you think he sucks. If you don't like profanity, then again...I don't know what you're doing reading reviews about Kevin Smith material.

I've read some reviews complain that some of the material he goes over they've already heard on his website, or that it just sounds like he's doing a stand up routine. HE IS DOING A STAND UP ROUTINE! Of course he directs the questions towards stories he can tell (and that he's fine-tuned). That's how a comedian works. I know he's not exactly a stand up comedian, but for all intents and purposes here...he is! Comedians will work on material for months or even years before they are completely happy with it. Then, the good ones take the jokes they've been cultivating and put it on a DVD. That's all Smith is doing here, and it works. You may have heard some of this stuff on a Smodcast, but it's still great to have it all in one DVD to rewatch whenever you want. There's so much good stuff on here that even if you don't like a story or two, you're bound to laugh out loud dozens of times.

And that brings me to the length. People actually complain about the length of the thing? It's not a movie where you have to watch the whole thing from beginning to end to get the entire experience. Just watch it in hour long pieces if you need to. It's great to have something you can rely on for a few laughs even if you only have a half hour.

Keep them coming, Mr. Smith!",1259798400,10,2049,4.27319587628866
3509259,5,B001CDFY4Q,The product was as stated and it arrived in a timely matter.  I would purchase again from this seller.,1254960000,,102,4.368421052631579
3509260,3,B001CDFY4Q,"I am a big fan of Kevin Smith's work. His films, for the best part, have been highly entertaining and hilarious. I also really enjoyed Kevin's My Boring [...] Life book and his subsequent live shows. More to the point though- I am a fan of Kevin's Smodcast, which for those that don't know is a free podcast and is now nearly 100 episodes old. With each episode being roughly an hour long, that is a helluva lot of Kevin. And therein lies the problem- A lot of these anecdotes have already been told, both on that show and in blogs. With Kevin now releasing a new book, culled from the best bits of Smodcast. That means that you may well have heard some of these stories up to four times including this DVD. First Kevin tells an anecdote about his dogs which goes on for the best part of an hour. That's right- THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR. And to be honest, it really wasn't that funny- oh, and he'd already done it on the aforementioned Smodcast.

See, the biggest problem for me here is that the Q and A portion of the show is basically non-existent now. Barely any questions from the audience get a straight response. Instead what Kevin does is twist it in order to do another pre-prepared piece. Why he doesn't just tell the audience to sit down I don't know. The majority of those lining up to ask a question were stood up for HOURS. And they still didn't get their questions answered.

There is some good stuff here, mostly on the second disc. The Bruce Willis bit is very interesting, though it is taken nearly word-for-word from Kevin's book My Boring [...] Life, which took the story directly from one of Kevin's previous blogs. It just makes me wonder what happened to Kevin somewhat fiercely attacking some of those big Hollywood names? This isn't dreadful, and if you have never heard Smodcast or read any of this guy's blogs, you will be highly amused, in parts. But for the rest of us- well, maybe Kevin just need to shut up for a little bit.",1253664000,,1953,4.392265193370166
3509261,2,B001CDFY4Q,"First of all let me get this out. I love almost all of Kevin Smiths movies. I think he is a great writter/director and really funny guy. Now to the bashing on this DVD. The first one was great, the second one was good if you never saw Clerks 2, this third one however was just plain awfull. In the total of almost 4 hours he answers only 6 maybe 8 questions.  When another reviewer said that it seems the answers were planned I couldn't agree more. I give Kevin props for taking any question someone threw at him ""if it was a random question from a random person or someone who knew what to ask in order to get on the dvd"" and manipulate the answer in order to bring out an already rehearsed monologue. What an Evening has become to me is a practice round for some funny jokes in order to get the reaction of the crowd to see if its funny enough to be entered in his next movie. For example on the first Evening w/K.S. someone asks him if he would ever put something from the Q&As to a movie and he says no everyone hear has already heard that joke (talking about his open sore dick in his wifes battery acid vag), then on Evening 2 he does the whole Lord of the Rings joke and later sure enough it ends on Clerks 2. Do not be surprised when you watch this movie that the jokes won't be included in his next project.  If you feel like spending 14 bucks and like Kevin Smith this movie aint bad enough to have as background noise while doing something else. Otherwise save your money and watch the shorten jokes on his next flick.",1249084800,,1529,4.1447811447811445
3509262,4,B001CDFY4Q,If you enjoyed the other evening with Kevin Smith DVDs you'll enjoy this one.  Kevin Smith is great at telling a story and he'd really funny here.,1239667200,,146,4.407407407407407
3509263,3,B001CDFY4Q,"Love Keven Smith. Loved the last 2 DVD's. This one falls way short. Found it boring and drawn out.

He takes one subject and talks about it for what seems like an hour. Then wanders off into something else and babbles on. I know, I know... He's always done that! But THIS time its a little boring.

As another reviewer stated, there isn't much about movie making in there, nor about comics, which are things his audience want to hear about. Thats the entertaining stuff I want to hear from Keven in these things.

There are some funny bits in there though too. Some I heard already (Opie and Anthony), and some other funny stuff.

I guess they cant all be winners.

If you're a major fanboy like I am, pick it up. But Im sure you'll agree that it seems to drag on. If you wanna know about Kevs dogs, jump on this sucker....",1236124800,,823,4.283870967741936
3509274,5,B001CDFY4Q,"Kevin Smith has some of the BEST stories around one of them involves anal fissure and his time spent on a jury, that story alone is worth buying this DVD - I wish it was on Blu-ray by the way...if you like the previous two Evening's with Kevin Smith pick this one up for sure. The special features rock as well.",1233619200,,311,4.114754098360656
3509275,4,B001CDFY4Q,I am a fan of Kevin Smith. Threevening made me laugh and he has interesting stories to tell. The only thing I could have done without was his story about his bathroom habits (in which he goes into great detail) But I don't want to hear anyone talk about that no matter how funny they are.,1233446400,,288,4.160714285714286
3509276,4,B001CDFY4Q,"Although it's not as good as the first two evenings, it's still funny as hell. The first half of the first disc is the weakest part, but it gets a lot better from there. A must have.",1232668800,,182,3.945945945945946
3509277,5,B001CDFY4Q,"I am telling the truth when I say that I could listen to Kevin talk for hours and not get bored. There is about five hours worth of Q&A and it flies by fast and leaves me wanting even more! If you are a fan of Kevin Smith, this and the previous two are must buys! I'll go a step further and say that I think Threevening is better than Evening Harder (the second film). Not that I am saying that the second is bad, but that this series is only getting better!",1232496000,,458,3.935483870967742

I thought the first two An Evening With's, were better, this one seemed planned ahead, like he had some stories he wanted to tell and forced these stories as answers.  Don't get me wrong, the stories are entertaining, they just seemed forced.  I think the main part of the DVD lasted about 3 1/2 hours and he answered maybe 6 questions. The extras consisted of additional questions which I found to be more entertaining.",1230422400,,445,4.5375

Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. He also directed Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl though they are a lot more serious, especially Jersey Girl. Anyway this is the 3rd in a series of Q&A specials where fans get to ask him a question and he'll usually ramble 20-30 mins on a single question but its all funny. Telling stories about his experiences with hollywood personalities and funny stories about his personal life.
