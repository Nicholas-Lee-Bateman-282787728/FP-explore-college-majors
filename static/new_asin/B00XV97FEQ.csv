8716703,4,B00XV97FEQ,"I am still watching this show, and I have to say it is HILARIOUS.  Each episode begins with a ""flash-forward,"" which the episode then goes back in time to explain, and the lead-up to the episode's beginning is never what you expected!  I have watched over 30 K-Dramas, and I'd have to say that as far as the romance-comedy genre goes, this one is up there with The Greatest Love and Personal Taste.  The English subtitles are really good, too- one of my biggest pet peeves, as I've been burned before buying KDramas on DVD and having the subtitles be so bad the show is unwatchable.  Not the issue here--I'm halfway through this show, and I can't wait to see what else it has in store!",1467072000,,685,4.412698412698413
