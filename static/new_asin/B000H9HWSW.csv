8137725,4,B000H9HWSW,"The Eberharts do a great job of presenting a very precise and deliberate approach to hunting whitetails. They tell you exactly why they do what they do and you will have some ""AH HA"" moments. They get down into some details that most hunters would not consider. They have a lot of detailed strategic and tactical knowledge. They let you know that these videos do not contain nearly the amount of details in their books, ""Precision Bowhunting"" and ""Bowhunting Pressured Whitetails"". These videos are very informative and engaging. But, because they are not comprehensive(they don't contain all the information), I gave them a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star. They are definitely worth the money if only to actually see on video how they execute some of their tactics. I'm looking forward to reading the books!",1312588800,,810,4.963235294117647
