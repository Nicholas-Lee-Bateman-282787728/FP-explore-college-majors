2784656,5,B000NVLF46,Into Great Silence at least made the art house circuit.  This is a better look at monastic life as a religious phenomenon.,1198454400,4,122,4.545454545454546
2784657,5,B000NVLF46,"A beautiful hour-long video documentary of a 90 day retreat for Zen (Cham Sun) Buddhist nuns at 10th century Baek Hung Temple in South Korea. Throughout long meditation periods, the Zen master's discreet encouragements, manual labor, cooking, eating, and more long meditation periods, the camera NEVER intrudes, creating in the viewer a natural sense of being present at retreat. The silence of the film is positively life-giving. The pungent natural winter landscapes outside the monastery remind me of Korean film master Ki-Duk Kim's work. Heartily recommended for practictioners, and surely many people can reap rewards from an effort as honest as this. In Search of Self possesses a spiritual essence not to cajole or intervene, but to leave free and gratified anyone who seeks a film like this for sustenance.",1182297600,31,814,5.269230769230769
2784658,5,B000NVLF46,"This is a wonderful DVD for Zen practitioners and anyone wondering what a retreat is like at its most disciplined. Filmed at a centuries-old temple in the chill-to-the-marrow winter months in the mountains of Korea, viewers get to see 24 Buddhist monks practice this discipline for 90 days. That's 90 days in a row!

Watching what these people went through makes the pain you experience in your legs after 25 minutes suddenly seem quite insignificant.

Highly recommended.",1178496000,23,472,5.116883116883117

2784695,3,B000NVLF46,Beautiful picture of the contemplative retreat of 24 Buddhist nuns over a 90 day period.  Their very simple life and joy are a tremendous break from the life most of us live.  It was with great joy that I shared this short time with them through this movie.,1418083200,,257,4.333333333333333

2784697,4,B000NVLF46,"This film documents the 90 days meditation practice of a Korean Zen tradition. It shows the practice from the sitting meditation, walking meditation, preparation of food meditation, consuming of food meditation, cleaning up meditation, sweeping meditation, chanting practice...in a remote mountainous area. Also, an outing of rigorous hiking, singing...A simple, devotional, discipline, rigorous practice and life style.

2784698,1,B000NVLF46,very disjointed. poorly translated. just seems to occasionally post up random text about what we're seeing. doesn't really go anywhere. teaches very little about Zen or Buddhism.,1407196800,2,178,5.62962962962963

2784700,5,B000NVLF46,"This film is an extraordinary. The nuns' are beautiful, the retreat is calm and calming (for me), and the landscape is wonderous. I don't know how the nuns sit and meditate for so long and so quietly. I envy their focus.",1392595200,,220,4.390243902439025
2784701,2,B000NVLF46,"The movie wasn't bad per se',  It was interesting to watch the various rituals of Buddhist Nuns going through their pilgrimage but it just wasn't interesting enough for me to rate it more than two.",1391299200,,197,4.628571428571429
2784702,5,B000NVLF46,"All of the negative reviews I've read while understanding their frustrations I believe they missed the message. This is the life of a nun or monk in the school of Zen Buddhism. Nothing flashy nothing to be said. MAny people approach Buddhism with the thought it's going to make everything peaceful or easier. Truly following the path to.enlightenment is not easy even monks and nuns have to practice diligently to overcome their negative emotions. This documentary is a true view of the subject without commentary or narration by celebrities selling Buddhism  . It's not easy, it's an everyday battle against ones own wandering mind",1391126400,5,632,5.076923076923077
2784703,5,B000NVLF46,wonderful view in to a retreat....thank you...many great scenes thank you to all participants for a great time i will watch again...,1387584000,,132,5.045454545454546
2784724,4,B000NVLF46,Feeling generated in the documentary was consistently serene. I was fascinated by mundane aspects of life of zen monks and the beauty of ordinary things like stacks of wood. Loved the sound track (or absence of sound at times).,1386028800,,227,4.846153846153846
2784725,4,B000NVLF46,"This movie caught my attention as I have recently rekindled my interest in Buddhism, more particularly in Zen Buddhism. This is not for someone looking to learn how to become a Zen Buddhist or really much about Zen Buddhism's history (although some nuns do venture into the topic of the Buddha). The movie is more about a retreat during the Lunar calender and the nuns practice in their journey. It breaks down day by day activities, chants, prayer and of course meditation. Looking from the outside (like one reviewer stated) this might look like cruel and unusual punishment, but there is much more to this, this is, in a nutshell, MIND OVER BODY and the movie explains some of these things if you simply watch and read the subtitles.

Overall, I enjoyed it, I feel it reminds all of us that life is and can be simple it just depends whether you choose to look at it from the top of the mountain and see yourself in the big picture or if you choose to look at it from the bottom of a mountain and see yourself against the world.",1376611200,,1030,4.421052631578948
2784726,4,B000NVLF46,"What I liked is that it is  a very peaceful movie. The nuns seem very  happy in  what they are doing . The not only meditate but play games, walk and cook in a very kind and peaceful atmosphere that  even through the movie is contagious!",1371859200,,237,4.086956521739131
2784727,1,B000NVLF46,Boring. Unzenlike.  Makes a monk's life look like prison.  It depicts them as prisoners walking around and getting hit with sticks.,1362700800,,131,5.190476190476191
2784728,1,B000NVLF46,"I am learning more about Buddhism and felt this would be a good documentary to help me along my path. However, the director did not explain much about what was happening in the movie, and even less about Buddhism.",1362528000,2,213,4.487179487179487
2784729,5,B000NVLF46,This is an excellent look at a Korean zen retreat that shows the dedication and joyfulness of the nuns who participate in this intensive practice. The film is very moving and inspiring. I highly recommend this dvd. It is a film with depth and beauty - excellent in every way.,1343433600,,275,4.52
2784730,1,B000NVLF46,"I have watched many documentaries on Buddhism, and I have enjoyed most of them except this one.  The cinematography was terrible as if the person holding the camera was clueless. At least if it was shot beautifully then I could at least have a relaxing time watching it.

There seemed to be no point to this documentary, and there was nothing to be learned.  The short interviews with the nuns were superficial in content, and this is the only Buddhist documentary I have seen that made Buddhism seem stupid.  I am a Buddhist so I have a lot of love for the religion, but I think if I was forced to watch this video a second time I may quit being a Buddhist.",1255046400,3,658,4.32520325203252
2784731,5,B000NVLF46,"This is one of the better films about Zen and for a very simple reason. It doesn't preach and therefore doesn't get bogged down in philosophy and metaphysics. It teaches only by pointing the camera at its subject, the 90-day winter retreat of the nuns of Korea's Baek Hung temple. If you ever wanted to know what a mediation retreat is like, this film will give you a nice taste.

What you see is that the nuns spend a lot of time inside sitting quietly. This is followed by periods of walking in circles in the courtyard. Once in a while they go out for a hike in the surrounding mountains, or collect wood from the forest. They cook meals. On New Year's they do a lot of cleaning and praying and visiting of nearby temples. And that's about it.

Of course if you know nothing or very little about Buddhism or Zen then you might be a bit confused about just what's going on. The Korean film makers, who produced this for Korean television, could assume their audience had the background to understand what they were being shown. And so they simply pointed the camera. There are one or two brief interviews with the head nuns, and a couple of scenes of the nuns chatting together, but for most of the film's 65 minutes all you hear are bells and wind and rain.

The film ends with the nuns leaving the temple:

  Where did I come from?
  Where am I going to?

  Came with the cloud,
  Going with the wind.

  Then, what is this
  that is coming and going?

2784732,1,B000NVLF46,"This is a misleading DVD because the title leads one to think one will gain insight into zen buddhism.  Obviously the title was a marketing ploy.  I guess they knew that if they gave a title that was ""real"" people wouldn't buy this.  A ""real"" title would be: ""silent, unenlightening montage of video of korean buddhist nuns"".  There is no narration or explanation of zen buddhism, simply video montage of korean buddhist nuns undergoing a 90 day meditation.  Very cheap documentary and highly misleading.  unless you want to watch two hours of korean nuns meditating, avoid this like the plague.",1237939200,8,595,4.9
2784733,3,B000NVLF46,"...and it is not. Clean shots of what is going on in a Zen monastery. It tends to be repetitive which I guess is alright as a parallel to the monastic life of these nuns.
It feels like a home made movie shot without much detail.
Indoor shots are at very bright artificial light. Feels like the people shooting it were in a hurry to get it done and get out of there.
But then, this is just my opinion...",1214006400,11,402,4.0375

8181818,5,B000NVLF46,"I've seen this twice, love it, and am planning to show it at a local ecumenical Buddhist movie night. Yes, the title is misleading --- these nuns are definitely not searching for Self, their lives are the opposite of Self. And yes it is a little like a home movie --- straightforward, nothing artsy about it. But if you want to know what Buddhist practice actually looks like, this is exactly what it looks like, in all its repetitive (of course it's repetitive! it's a 90 day retreat!), concentrated, meticulous, humble glory. And when the women break out of their intense practice --- the mountain hike complete with a spontaneous popular love song, celebrating the new year by competitive games with monks --- their humanity shines through, you see that they are no different from you, that serious practice is open to anyone. I am inspired by these women. You can be too.",1430870400,,875,4.7254901960784315
8181819,4,B000NVLF46,I would recommend a basic understanding of Buddhism or else this film won't appeal to you or I guess you won't fully enjoy it. I did and I find it fascinating,1430352000,,158,4.129032258064516
