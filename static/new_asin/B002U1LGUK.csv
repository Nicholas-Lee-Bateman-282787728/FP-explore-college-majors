3986977,4,B002U1LGUK,"Recipe: Take Carry Elwes, Bruce Greenwood and Kathleen Quinlan, then add an interesting plot, stir all together for about 90 minutes and then enjoy the end product--a surprisingly good and tasty morsel of a movie.

""The Riverman"" is based upon a well written fact based book by Robert Keppel, PhD, the man who interviewed Ted Bundy with the hopes of getting inside Bundy's mind in effort to help find the infamous Green River Killer.  The interviews aided the Washington state authorities in the apprehension of Gary Leon Ridgway for nearly 50 murders to a point, however, Keppel's talks with Bundy actually achieved more success in attaining Bundy's motives for his own killings, along with getting Bundy to add closure for several Washington families by confessing to several of the Seattle area's unsolved murders.

This movie could easily have been called ""The Campus Killer Interviews"" or ""A Brief Look Inside the Mind of the Lady Killer"" since it was more about Bundy's interviews with Keppel, and not so much about Ridgway, aka the Green River Killer.  In fact, if you're looking for a portrayal or more indepth look at Ridgway, you can get hold of Uli Lommel's 2006 ""Green River Killer"" (not good, but OK) or one of the several bio DVD's available on Ridgway.

No matter what the title of this movie is however, it is superb due to the excellent acting in the two lead roles:  Cary Elwes as Ted Bundy, who does a stupendous job at delving into the mind of Bundy and bringing it to the viewer; and Bruce Greenwood as Robert Keppel, who has the innate ability to get you to empathize with Keppel's inner and outer struggles in dealing with his link to two prolific serial killers he had the displeasure of hunting down.  Kathleen Quinlan, as usual, does a wonderful job in her small supporting role as Mrs Keppel.

Contray to the title, if you're looking for a look at the Green River Killer's murders and a lot of action, you will have to look elsewhere; on the other hand, if you are looking for a good psychological drama with a brief, seemingly simple (yet actually quite complex) view of the inside of Ted Bundy's mind, then this flick is for you.",1286064000,23,2158,4.690476190476191
3986978,3,B002U1LGUK,"PROS:
*A career-defining performance by Cary Elwes as Ted Bundy--a cold calculating embodiment of evil
*Good support from Bruce Greenwood and Sam Jaeger
*Good capturing of 70s-80s culture
CONS:
*While ostensibly about Gary Ridgeway, the movie focuses most of its time on Bundy and Koppel (sp) shedding little light on Ridgeway
SUMMARY:  Though slow-paced and misguided, Elwes makes it worthwhile.",1280016000,2,396,5.6
3986979,5,B002U1LGUK,"I bought this film for one reason, Mr. Cary Elwes.
He does not disappoint in this.
In this film he became Ted Bundy. His voice. His facial expressions. It was Bundy in the flesh once more.
Superb acting job on his part.

The film isn't filled with murders or action. Its more of a psychological thriller.",1268697600,4,304,4.428571428571429
3986980,5,B002U1LGUK,"First, none of the tags apply to this film. Second, this is a documentary on the Green River Killer, America's most prolific serial killer, and how he was apprehended as a result of an utterly harrowing, terrifying mind-merge between a real-life profiler and Ted Bundy, America's second most prolific and most notorious serial killer. There is otherwise no plot, characters or exploitation of the grisly and unique story. The book on which this film is based is the basis of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the ""collaboration of one serial killer with police to identify another.""

What distinguishes this film is the extraordinary, risky, dangerous, authentically evil performance of Bundy by Cary Elwes. Elwes was the male eye-candy star of ""Princess Bride"" and a series of romantic adventure films in his youth, when his own beauty and life experience must have taught him how prostitutes and ""johns"" engage in fantasy possession of another person's body and will. Elwes' powerful beauty faded fast, and he then made a series of poorly acted, shallow, often overplayed and embarrassing films. An actor he was not. But an amazingly intelligent, intuitive, deep-minded person with almost total access to the horrors which underlie such peculiar beauty and obsession as motivates reciprocal using of another person, from prostitution to serial killing, he is. If this is a ""performance"" of Ted Bundy, it is one of the greatest screen portrayals of direct empathy with evil I have ever seen. More likely this is a revelation of the deepest shames, angers, dangers, revenges and obsessions that possesses often incomprehensible or trivialized psycho-pathology by a man who knows it.

The difference between the Cary Elwes of glamor fame, the Cary Elwes of ham actor distinction, and this Cary Elwes who ""is or becomes"" the most fully realistically portrayed sexual psychopath in film history is literally unimaginable. Make no mistake:-- this is not a good director getting the best from a second-rate actor. This is an amazing man (Elwes) revealing breadth and depth in serial killer psycho-pathology seen only by those professionals unlucky enough to meet the Real Thing. Yes, bravo Hopkins, Cox and even Hall for dramatic portrayal -- theater work an audience can leave in the theater. Elwes is something of an entirely different dimension of dark reality you will not soon if ever forget.

I will never trash Cary Elwes' work again, though I cannot explain his shallow performances as a youth. Maybe he was just too intelligent and sensitive for the roles his charismatic beauty landed him in and how he was treated and used. I don't know. But somehow he brings real horror up and out of the depths of the human soul for all to see, and it makes me quite glad I never had the misfortune to underestimate the man to his face.",1267574400,8,2821,4.997872340425532

This movie belongs to Cary Elwes who plays Ted Bundy. He plays the part in a cunning, calculating, chilling way. It gives you some insight into the how the mind of a serial killer works and also shows how many of these ""killers"" have mental issues that develop from things that happen to them way back in childhood. In no way does this give them a excuse for what they do, but proves that metal illness is a real issue that involves a awful lot of people and the proper steps are not being taken to help the mentally ill.

3987000,5,B002U1LGUK,"Bruce Greenwood does a wonderful job as Robert Keppel in portraying Keppel's dedication and simultaneous angst about his skills as a profiler. The story focus is more on Keppel's interactions w/Ted Bundy as he tries to gain insight into the Green River Killer to fine tune a profile to capture him.  While some highlights of the Green River killings are given and a brief spotlight on Ridgway is provided at the very end, that really only frames the more central story of Keppel's efforts to solve the case. So, if you're actually looking for more in-depth coverage on the Green River killer himself and his murders or the complete accounting of the Green River task force and all it when through, then I strongly advise you watch ""The Capture of the Green River Killer"" w/Tom Cavanagh as Det. Dave Reichert, instead. But if Keppel and the inner workings of profiling and Bundy in his last days on earth are your interest - this film hits spot on.",1455840000,3,947,4.6706586826347305

3987004,3,B002U1LGUK,"The movie, The Riverman, is based on a book, The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I hunt for the Green River Killer, by Robert D. Keppel, Ph. D.  As the movie begins, a young womans body is found in the shallows of the Green River near Seattle.  The young detective assigned to the case decides to enlist the help of criminal psychologist Keppel, who was very much involved in the manhunt for serial killer Ted Bundy.  After Kepple is signed on to the GR case, he decides to go to Florida to pick the brain of Bundy, who is on death row there.  Koppel believed that Bundy could provide insight into the mind of a serial killer.  Bundy agrees to discuss the GR case with the detective and Keppel, and it soon becomes obvious that Bundys motivation for doing so is that (a) he is bored, and (b) he will try to milk the situation for his own benefit.

The movie proceeds in a conversational tone between Keppel and Bundy, with flashbacks showing how Bundy proceeded to lure unsuspecting women into his web and subsequently murdered. The movie produces more information about Bundy than the GR murderer, and the movie ends with Bundy still on death row, and the GR murders unsolved.  I watched the movie on Amazon Prime a few days ago, and when I was asked to provide a review, I had to refresh my memory as to what it was about.",1453507200,,1316,4.390946502057613

3987016,5,B002U1LGUK,"Relating to some of the other reviews,it was about bundy more so I believe and bundy called the GRK the Riverman title. God, the guy who played ted bundy was very very very good Cary Elwes wonder why they didn't use him in the Lifetime Movie he much more reminded me of Ted Bundy than the actor who portrayed him in the lifetime version. Personally,I think the GRK was in Cali too I believe. Some place said he ws stationed in San Diego this guy got around but back to Bundy no this is Keppel's version of events relating fo have to go see Bundy in Fl on death row to talk about the Riverman and what to look for to find the killer. Thats really the synopsis of this whole fim and it was fantastic it was really really good the director gets an A plus especially delving and reenacting the Bundy scenes and of showing how the whole business of ""Killing"" affected Keppel in life and pretty much his whole life and career. It was really really eerie but I liked it immensely. It also gave Bundy a touch of humanity you almost empathize w/ how he developed his rage from a young man however there are  many people who go on from worse childhoods than this or Ridgeways and do not go on to kill. Not to excuse the sins of their mothers,fathers etc. that had a lot to do with the way they turned out I believe. Anyways,I did expect to see more about Ridgeway but still it was an excellent film,maybe victinms fanilies should see it, yes, these people really do get affected that have to see this s*** over and over,how horrible for them.nicely done!!!",1431129600,,1546,4.312714776632302

3987018,5,B002U1LGUK,"I vaguely remember seeing this movie (and it was indeed made-for-TV, which surprises me) around 2005.

Perhaps some of the other viewers are a bit more hardened than myself in terms of what they watch; this movie has lingered in my memory ever since, especially Cary Elwes' performance.  I'm sure a lot of forensic psych majors have seen this as it is practically an advertisement for the field.

The story begins around the time that Theodore Robert Bundy (played here by Cary Elwes to a demonic perfection) brutal killer of an almost unknown number of women mailed Dr. Robert Keppel (the police investigator assigned to the capture of the Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway, who was caught in 2001) a letter from death row, claiming that he might have some ""insights"" into what their subject was doing, or what his habits might be. Keppel and his partner Dave Reichert (who would eventually capture Ridgway) were desperate enough to actually meet with Bundy and entertain his ideas.

Cary Elwes seems like a nice, scholarly British actor. He must have been tugging real hard on his dark side, though, because it came out and his portrayal of the disempowered, imprisoned Bundy is a perfect--I mean Heath Ledger's Joker perfect--performance. Greenwood and Elwes have an almost perfect rapport; though he tells Keppel he can ""take him there without drowning"" (meaning into the mind of the Green River Killer) what he of course wants is precisely for him to drown, to become a warped monster like himself.  Elwes delivers this well: Bundy was contemptuous of Keppel, contemptuous of his victims, and didn't represent anything but his own malign brain chemistry. He keeps comparing himself to others to infect them.

There's a sort of black shamanism to all this, implications about the underbelly of the specifically male psyche which are truly foul.  Kathleen Quinlan, beautiful as always, plays Keppel's wife, who urges him to pull back from his work.  Though the horror genre works on some unpleasant material to achieve a (temporarily) cathartic effect, none of this is cathartic.  This is all quite real, from the conversations to the victims and the implications about our society.  The only justice in it all is the presence of two guys like Bob Keppel and Dave Reichert, who were willing to put brain and body--mostly brain--at stake to stop these guys.

Definitely recommended for fans of the true crime genre.",1429920000,2,2416,4.985074626865671

It always comes back top the same basics. Mainly control. Sex gets the most attention from the public regarding ""motives"", but it's more of an excuse or a side show. They do it because they want to.  If you need to hang on to an ""M-O"" then call it power/control. Sex, souvenirs, etc. are the tongue waggers if involved, but understanding their own constant accounts of control issues are the key. Just ask Adolph.
M-Os are different, even for the same perp. Like Bundy said, they have the problem, but often are far from stupid.
What is  amazing is how often authorities have them in hand and then let them go.
Also it is interesting to listen to the real Bundy tells us (even in the movie) how the successful ones are ""soft as rain"", friendly, ""normal"", etc. and then the movie gives you shots looking deeply into Carys' eyes as he puts on his most dangerous scary looks.

3987034,3,B002U1LGUK,"I watched this after I watched another better movie on a similar subject(Citizen X). This film didn't really concentrate on the crimes or the criminal responsible. It also skated over the victims rather dismissively I thought. The concentration was too focused on the police officers and a different serial killer, Ted Bundy, who got involved in the Green River Killer case out of boredom, or in an effort to get a stay for his execution, or perhaps simply seeking to feed his own monster vicariously through the Green River Killer's crimes. Unthinkably, Bundy requested and got the crime scene file and photos.

While the film does a great job representing Bundy as a narcissistic monster, the movie was supposed to be about a different killer. If it wasn't, then the movie should have been renamed. The portrayal of Bundy was actually chilling, the actor doing a great job of conveying the kind of person he was. But, again, it was not the right guy, Ridgeway was barely mentioned for the majority of the film. Rather we are treated to scenes with the officers and the officers families, or the only amusing moment in the film when three maids at a Florida hotel catch two of the detectives in their underwear having a chat in the door of a motel room. I mention that only because in a film with this subject it shouldn't be the scene that stands out. I was rather bored for much of the film.

What made this letter, a whopping 22 pages long, so special was the name of the sender; the writer had eluded the grasp of this same detective before. That man was Ted Bundy.

This movie is based upon a book written by Bob Keppel, and everything in the above paragraph happened in real life. After the Green River killer was apprehended in 2001, Keppel sat down to write a book about his experience in tracking the killer and how he came to Florida to interview another notorious killer who offered his input to help catch TGRK (for short). While the book covers more detail about the investigation's evolution over time, the movie ""The Riverman"" focuses on the actions of Ted Bundy during the final days of his life.

The Syopsis

""The Riverman"" is a drama that details how one investigator worked on the case of the Green River Killer, as well as his personal life and how his work affected his family. The pace of the movie is sluggish at first; it begins with an inner monologue by Keppel while he is washing his car and his children are playing around nearby. He is a man who is haunted by images of the bodies of murder victims, as well as him not being able to ""catch"" Ted Bundy earlier in his career. He is now a Captain on the police force, and while not formally a member of TGRK's Task Force, he is very interested in capturing the culprit; the lead detective on the case is a good friend and former student, and he uses this connection to learn details about the ongoing investigation.

While the movie does a good job of introducing characters, it is frustrating in its focus. The primary plot concerns the fact that Ted Bundy, of his own volition, wrote a letter to Mr. Keppel offering his advice in order to catch the killer. From there we see that Mr. Keppel joins an expanded task force, and along with his friend and fellow investigator Dave Reichert. The performances by both characters are unbalanced, and with a plot that doesn't really have a ""high"" point, you end up with the confusion of what it is that the detectives are after.

For his part, Cary Elwes (who plays Ted Bundy) does a great job at portraying the deviousness of Ted Bundy; being creepy enough to lead you to truly see the evil of a man who brutally killed roughly 30 women. As such you are never quite sure what the motivation was; Bundy hints at things that he wants (namely putting a stay on his execution), but is also very talkative with the detectives. Slowly, the movie evolves into a different story: the Green River Killer investigation suddenly becomes tangential to the narcissism of Bundy, and how his opinions of who TGRK is suddenly transition into a deeper meaning.

Final Say

This movie is more of a documentary, detailing an aspect of a real-life serial killer investigation and throwing in family strife to offset the darkness. While I felt that the detectives were directionless at times, eventually the movie picks up and renders both of the detectives in a positive light. The performance by Elwes is excellent, and the scenes with Bruce Greenwood (Keppel) show a definite chemistry in their banter. While the plot is somewhat anticlimactic, it is still interesting to see the interviews with Bundy, especially when you consider just how accurate his ""suggestions"" were. If you want a snuggle movie that is based on fact, this is a great title. Just don't expect any explosions, brutal violence, or action.",1398816000,7,3612,4.634375

3987043,3,B002U1LGUK,"I find it interesting that most reviewers talk about 'the plot' when this was based on actual events and feelings.  I have great pity for those who have to investigate murders, interact with families, and try to understand the impossible.  To listen to 'reasons' from the human animal for horrendous acts of deviant control has to take a toll on how they view life and how their families have to survive.

I chose 3 stars which says 'I liked it'.  No - I found it interesting, but I also found it nauseating.  All of these women died to satisfy the demented egotistical appetites of two human animals.  Their egos are sated with infamy right up until the time of their deaths.  Bundy is gone, but Ridgeway can still bask in his sick admirer's and his own memory.",1391126400,,762,4.518248175182482

3987048,4,B002U1LGUK,"This movie turned out to be a lot better than I expected. The guy playing Ted Bundy did an amazing job. I love Silence of the Lambs and it may be a better movie, but that story is fiction, so it doesn't quite scratch the ""true crime itch"" that a movie like this does. It sucks that there are so many bad movies on here and other streaming sites so I'm always hesitant about committing to watch a movie I've never heard of, but this was pretty good.",1384214400,3,448,4.1022727272727275

3987055,4,B002U1LGUK,"Good movie in showing the limitations that police faced in forensics back in the day. It was good to see old fashioned police work in attempts to catch the River Man. Cary Elwes as Bundy was a good representation of the man himself. He portrayed his cockiness & narcissism as well as his, what I refer to, as his creep factor. He insinuates into your every fiber where you feel his anger & yes, his madness. This is one of the better films depicting Bundy even though the movie is about the River Man.",1373500800,,501,4.340425531914893

3987057,5,B002U1LGUK,"The difference between this film and other horror entries, is that this actually happened. That is always the deal breaker for me. There is a world of difference between this and, say, Evil Dead. While the latter may be ""an edge of the seat, nail biting fun ride"" The Riverman bears grim witness to stark heart breaking reality - NOT A FUN RIDE - With that being said this is a great movie! Ted Bundy virtually came back to life as portrayed by Cary Elwes and it  was stunning as well as soul numbing to watch. What a gifted actor! This movie also depicts the terrible toll it takes on everyone (even a tortured but very sick Ted Bundy) involved in crimes of this magnitude. Unfortunately, crimes of this nature show no sign of decline with one virtually in the headlines every other day. An uneasy glimpse into sheer terror and ultimately, tragedy.",1372809600,3,849,4.549019607843137

3987059,4,B002U1LGUK,"(Update August 2014:  I actually changed my review of Dr. Keppel's book in which this film was adapted from a 4 to a 5 a while back.  It might be the best serial book ever.)

From what I remember, it was Ted Bundy who coined the name ""Riverman"" for the killer of prostitutes in the Seattle area during the 70s and 80s.  I guess the name derived from the fact that the then unknown post-Bundy killer liked to dump his victims in the Green River.

Not a bad name given by not such a good guy, but Cary Elwes is fantastic here as the supposedly nastiest serial killer in US history:  Ted Bundy.  Sure, there have been those that have killed more people, such as Gary Ridgeway -- the actual Riverman himself -- but few that have killed in such a violent fashion such as Bundy.  But while Bundy was indeed bad, Mr. Elwes is not, never devolving into caricature as he seems to invade the true psyche of Bundy in this film.  I gave the film ""Silence of the Lambs"" five stars, but I believe that Mr. Elwes was given more realistic dialog here than Anthony Hopkins in that award-winning film, and this lesser known actor took advantage of it.

I read the book ""The Riverman:  Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer"" quite awhile ago, and I gave it four stars.  In reality, I probably should have gone five (I already did as I wrote above) since it is easily the best true crime book that I've read to date, surely better than ""Stranger Beside Me"" by Ann Rule.  Dr. Robert Keppel did an excellent job describing the things that I'm looking for in the genre:  what was going on from an historical perspective at the time, what were the motivations of the killer, and how did the detectives catch the perpetrator.  Not only that, but Dr. Keppel seems to be not only objective -- after all, he gave even an evil guy such as Bundy some kudos for helping catching Ridgeway -- but Dr. Keppel also seems to not be the ""gatekeeper"" type; he is willing to share his knowledge with others.  Note how Dr. Keppel spent so much of his life in a professor role, as evidence.

A very good movie that was adapted from an excellent book.  A pretty big recommendation by me.",1359417600,11,2155,4.331670822942644
