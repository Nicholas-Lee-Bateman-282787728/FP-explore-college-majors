1644131,5,B00005Q4DE,"A Rick Steves travel video will serve all of these suggestions, while also functioning as the Frugal Gourmet of travelers -- telling you how to travel light, easy and inexpensive.

This particular combo works well for anyone of a religious bent, wanting to see biblical holy places for an extended vacation. By packaging single episodes together like this, Steves lets people plan such a vacation with one-stop video suggestions and ideas.",1136246400,3,439,5.183098591549296

1644162,5,B00005Q4DE,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves?  This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

While each journey is only 30 minutes in length Rick has a unique talent of synthesizing the many facets that make up a people and place. He leaves no stone unturned in his analysis; historical background, spiritual heritage, cultural underpinnings and political legacy are all equally touched upon to give the audience a fuller understanding of the rural and urban landscape.

However not not an individual to dwell too much on the past, he provides a delightful tour of the markets, music, restaurants and nightlife. The kind of information would really want to know if you're out for a good time.

The production values are also wonderful offering fanstastic visuals that are worth watching even if there where no commentary. Traveling with Rick Steves' is the next best thing to being there.

This particular DVD contains eight episodes, thirty minutes in length. Imagine four hours traveling through Greece, Turkey, Israel and Egypt, better get started!",1207526400,8,1350,5.231481481481482
1644163,5,B00005Q4DE,"I bought this video to help with planning a Mediterranean cruise for our family next year and it was very helpful.  I have been a fan of Rick Steves for many years and always watch his travel shows hoping to someday visit every site as he brings such enthusiasm and usable information.  This DVD contains information on several places we have been talking about visiting for 20+ years and now we are convinced we must visit them.

In particular, the Istanbul and Western Turkey shows are full of great information and answered all our questions about whether to make stops in these areas - and the answer is YES!

Conversely, he visits Athens and shows that it may be only a one-day visit rather than several days for several reasons we had not considered.  He really does give you valuable information on what to see and what may be more ""hype"" than enjoyment.  The visits he made to other areas around Athens proved to be very valuable and now we are sure to visit those areas in addition to visiting Athens.  We probably wouldn't have realized that those areas would be just as enjoyable without seeing this video.  He really does cut through all the crap and give you what he thinks are the cream of the crop at each stop.

We haven't watched all the features on this DVD but having watched the Greece (2 shows) and 2 of the Turkey presentations, I can say this DVD has already been worth the money.  If you are planning a trip to the area, by land or by cruise ship, you need this video!!!!",1191456000,14,1495,4.443223443223443
