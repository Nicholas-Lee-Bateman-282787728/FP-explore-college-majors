1862227,4,B00008SCHJ,"Yes, you can certainly look at the three episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" collected under the title as ""Ricky's Opportunities"" as actually representing chances for Ricky to get ahead in show business.  But two times out of three what is supposed to be an opportunity for Ricky is really, so to speak, an opportunity for Lucy.  All three of these episodes were written by the celebrated triumvirate of Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr.  Nothing here is a classic, but average episodes of this classic television sitcom are still pretty funny.

Episode 7, ""The Sance"" (First aired November 26, 1951) finds Lucy suddenly becoming obsessed with numerology, so when she reads in the horoscopes that it is a good day for Ricky to make deals, she tells him.  The only problem is that she was reading yesterday's newspaper, so when Mr. Meriweather (Jay Novello) tries to call Ricky with a big deal Lucy keeps saying no.  The only solution to this mess turns out to be a sance conducted by the medium who lives next door to the Ricardos (i.e., Ethel).  Too bad it is awfully hot wherever that spirit voice is coming from.

Episode 101, ""The Mr. and Mrs. TV Show"" (First aired April 11, 1955) would be the new ""Breakfast with Lucy and Ricky"" show.  The problem is Ricky is not sure about the idea, but that is what the sponsor (Phipps Department Store) wants so he agrees.  But then Lucy finds out Ricky had been reluctant to let her do the show she decides to sabotage the dress rehearsal for the show.  Of course, she is only being told it is a dress rehearsal and the whole thing will go going out to the citizens of New York City.  This is one of those ""I Love Lucy"" episodes where we see Lucy do the whole thing right before it all goes terribly wrong.  You have to appreciate the irony that Lucy finally gets her big break and, once again, does herself in.  This is the best episode of the three by far.

Episode 103, ""Ricky's Movie Offer"" (First aired November 8, 1954) begins with news about robbers posing as reporters and salesmen to get into apartments and rob them.  So when a Hollywood talent scout (Frank Nelson) stops by the apartment to audition Ricky for a role in a movie, Lucy and the Mertzes are suspicious.  But we are not surprised when Lucy figures this is HER big break and decides to go with the Marilyn Monroe approach when she is given a small role in the screen test.  Fred and Ethel show up as Spanish dancers.  Obviously this is the beginning of the giant story arc that would take the Ricardos and Mertzes to Hollywood.",1115942400,,2552,4.496746203904555
1862228,4,B00008SCHJ,"Jumping to ""Wrong Conclusions"" is pretty easy with you are dealing with Lucy and it is also pretty funny.  This particular volume in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" also includes the first episode ever filmed after the unaired pilot for the one week that the show was shot with four cameras instead of three.  All three of these episodes are from the first season of ""I Love Lucy"" when the writing staff was creator and producer Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr.  Nothing here is a classic episode, but once you get past the heavy handedness of the first, the other two have some funny moments.

Episode 4, ""Lucy Thinks Ricky is Trying to Murder Her"" (First aired November 5, 1951) was actually the first episode of ""I Love Lucy"" filmed, but there were some post production problems that meant postponing when it was first aired.  That actually worked out better because you really have to know who Lucy and Ricky are for this to be really funny.  Those of us weaned on the show in syndication do not have that problem.  But Lucy does, because she is reading a thriller entitled ""The Mockingbird Mystery"" and is jumping at everything.  Ethel is not helping because she is engaging in fortune telling and when the Ace of Spades comes up for Lucy that means death.  So when Lucy overhears Ricky on the telephone trying to arrange for something to put into her drink (a sedative to help her relax) she, of course, assumes it is poison.  That means the only thing to do is for Lucy go down to the club and shoot Ricky before she dies.  Obviously an EARLY episode of the show is Lucy actually has access to a gun...

Episode 9, ""Drafted"" (First aired December 24, 1951) begins with Lucy opening a telegram addressed to Ricky that orders him to appear at the Army's Fort Dix in New Jersey.  So she assumes that Ricky has been drafted and when Ricky invites Fred to go along and the two of them start drilling in the living room with brooms (for their military number for a benefit show), the girls start knitting blankets and plan a going away party for the brave soldiers to whom they are married.  But this one has wrong conclusions going in both directions, because Ricky and Fred become convinced the girls are pregnant and decide to throw a surprise baby shower.  Since this episode aired on Christmas Eve there is a bit where the Ricardos and Mertzes dress up as Santa Claus that was cut from syndication.  Certainly this is the episode on this video that has the most happening in it.

Episode 27, ""The Kleptomaniac"" (First aired April 14, 1952) has Ricky jumping to the conclusion that Lucy is stealing things when he sees her hiding silverware in the closet.  Then Fred and Ethel see her hiding a cuckoo clock under her coat (even though it is chiming).  What is going on is that Lucy has been stashing things away for a charity bazaar.  So when Ricky brings in Dr. Robinson (Joseph Kearns), a psychiatrist, to hypnotize her, Lucy decides it is time to teach her husband a lesson and while she is ""under"" comes up with an extremely creative past as a klepto.  Pulling everybody's leg is the best part of this one and a nice ending to the tape.",1115251200,2,3173,4.531578947368421
1862229,4,B00008SCHJ,"For the moment I want to nominate the ""On Vacation"" volume in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" as the one with the name that least reflects the three episodes included on the videotape.  Not that I can come up with a better name to tie the trio together, but really only the middle one has the Ricardos and Mertzes on an actual vacation, namely their trip to Europe.  The other two stories take place at home and I have to tell you it is not a vacation if you are sleeping in your own bed (you can look it up).  The first episode was scripted by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., with Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf joining the writing staff for the last two seasons of the classic television sit com when the other two were filmed.  All three of these are solid episodes, but none rise to the moment of being an ""I Love Lucy"" classic.

Episode 80, ""Ricky Minds the Baby"" (First aired January 18, 1954) has Ricky home for the week because they are re-painting the club.  So he agrees to watch Little Ricky ((Joseph/Michael Mayer), telling the baby the story of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (in Spanish).  Then Lucy and Ethel plan to go shopping while Ricky and Fred watch the baby, but there is a football game on the television.  When the baby wanders off and Lucy finds him in the hallway it is time to teach Daddy a lesson.  So she calls Ricky and asks how the baby is doing, forcing Ricky and Fred to frantically search everywhere for him.  This episode has the distinction of being the only episode of ""I Love Lucy"" ever filmed without a studio audience in order not to distract the show's youngest actor.

Episode 148, ""Lucy in the Swiss Alps (First aired March 26, 1956) has the simple idea of having the Ricardos and Mertzes get caught in an abandoned cabin during an avalanche while hiking in the Swiss Alps.  Take a wild guess as to who causes the avalanche in the first place.  Convinced they are facing certain death because they have no food, the four confess their deepest and darkest secrets (okay, three of the four, because Ricky is no fool: he knows how things work out in television sit coms).  For those familiar with the concept of the deus ex machina from ancient Greek tragedy, the idea of an oompah band playing ""La Cucaracha"" is something to be seen.

Episode 176, ""Building a B.B.Q."" (First aired April 8, 1957) takes place at the Ricardos new home in suburban Connecticut.  Technically Ricky is on vacation, but he is at home and distracting Lucy from her housework.  So Lucy and Ethel come up with the bright idea of having Ricky and Fred building a barbecue in the backyard.  The twist comes when Lucy becomes convince that she has lost her wedding ring in the wet cement used to make the barbecue, which means the girls spend the night taking apart the giant barbecue brick by brick, and then putting it back together again before the boys wake up and notice.",1115164800,,2911,4.481060606060606
1862230,4,B00008SCHJ,"The obvious reaction to a trio of episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" brought together under the title ""Lucy Needs Help"" is to simply ask when does the redhead NOT need help?  After all, this tape in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" has the second episode of the show ever aired and one from the fifth season when the cast was roaming around Europe, and Lucy still needs help.  But that is why this is a classic television situation comedy and to be fair she actually does ask for help in all three of these episodes.  The first two are written by the shows creator and producer Jess Oppenheimer, Madleyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., with newcomers Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf joining the show's writing staff during that fifth season.

Episode 2, ""Be A Pal"" (First aired October 22, 1951) has Lucy all worried that the honeymoon is over.  So Ethel recommends a book by a Dr. Humphreys, ""How to Keep the Honeymoon from Ending.""  The self-help book advises becoming her husband's best friend so that is exactly what Lucy tries to do.  First, dresses up for breakfast, but Ricky fails to notice.  Then she joins Ricky and his friends for a game of poker, but that does not go well when Lucy ends up winning.  So then she decides to make the apartment a little bit of Cuba, including live chickens and mules, and lipsyncs to Carmen Miranda's  ""Mama Yo Quiero.""

Episode 58, ""Lucy Hires a Maid"" (First aired April 27, 1953) has Lucy about at the end of her rope because the baby is keeping her awake half the night.  The obvious solution is for the Ricardos to hire a maid, but Mrs. Porter (Verna Felton) is really only interested in taking care of herself rather than the apartment.  Lucy cannot get up enough nerve to actually fire the woman, so instead she turns the entire apartment into shambles hoping that will make the new maid want to quit.  If you are wondering which one of the kids who played Little Ricky on the show is doing the crying, it is Jerry Hausner, who played Ricky's agent.

Episode 151, ""Lucy's Bicycle Trip"" (First aired April 23, 1956) is the one where the Ricardos and the Mertzes are pedaling their way from Italy to the French Riviera.  It is Lucy's idea and the group uses up all of their luck when a friendly farmer lets them spend the night in a barn when the get exhausted on the way.  Of course, when they get to the Italian-French border it turns out Lucy does not have her passport.  It is her purse.  Which is locked in a suitcase.  Which was sent ahead to the hotel in Nice.  Now, all that stands between the redhead and the French Riviera is a border crossing manned by unfortunate French and Italian guards.  This last one is the best of the bunch, but the others are zany enough to be worth watching again (What?  You missed one of these episodes the first hundred times around?).",1115078400,,2816,4.45703125
1862231,5,B00008SCHJ,"This is a rather special volume in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" in ""The Beginning to the End"" brings together the two least seen episodes of the celebrated situation comedy.  The first actually predates the beginning in that it is the unaired pilot while the second, far from representing the end, was aired once and not seen again for decades.  There is also an above average regular episode to fill up the tape that is pretty good as well.

Episode 0 is the ""lost"" pilot episode for ""I Love Lucy"" so it was never aired until a CBS special on April 30, 1990 although it was kinescoped on March 2, 1951 as an audition for potential sponsors.  The fascination here is how different things are from the classic situation comedy.  Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball play Larry and Lucy Lopez, and the Mertzes are not part of the picture.  The script by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr. was based on an old ""My Favorite Husband Script.""  Cuban bandleader Larry hears from his agent Jerry (Jerry Hausner) that several big sponsors are coming by the club to see the show.  Larry is worried Lucy will try to be in the show, so he tries to send her to all the way downtown to take their wills to the lawyer.  But then Pepito the Clown shows up at the Lopez apartment injured and Lucy schemes to take his place in the show.  Note: For everybody who got excited when Lucille Ball was ""enceinte"" during the show's second season, the comedienne was six months pregnant with daughter Lucy when the pilot was Kinescoped.

Episode 10, ""The Fur Coat"" (First aired December 10, 1951) has Ricky showing up at the apartment with a $3,500 mink coat that he has rented for his act at the club.  Of course Lucy immediately assumes the mink is a surprise gift for her for their anniversary.  The next thing Ricky knows his wife is eating, sleeping and doing the dishes wearing ""her"" new mink.  So Ricky has Fred dress up as a thief to steal it back.  Of course a real thief (Ben Weldon) shows up first.  The best parts of this one are when Lucy gives Ricky a lesson and when she is finally parted from ""her"" coat.  This might be a regular episode sandwiched between the two specials, but it a solid example of why this show was a hit in its first seson in 1951-52 when it finished third in the ratings and had a rating of 50.9 (no show has done half that well since ""The Cosby Show"").

Episode 164, ""The I Love Lucy Christmas Show"" (First aired December 24, 1956), aired on Christmas Eve and has the distinction of being the first retrospective episode for a television situation comedy. While trimming the tree the Ricardos and Mertzes think back on the wonderful and wacky events leading up to the birth of Little Ricky. Included are the memorable moments from when Lucy tells Ricky she is pregnant to when she is taken to the hospital. The episode ends on Christmas morning with Little Ricky opening up all his presents and getting a visit from FIVE Santa Clauses (think about it). This episode achieved special status because it was not part of the package when ""I Love Lucy"" went into syndication because CBS did not think anyone would want to see a Christmas show when it was not Christmas time. After Lucille Ball's death the network finally aired the show twice, the second time in a colorized version.",1114646400,4,3311,4.517587939698492
1862232,4,B00008SCHJ,"If you are used to the three episodes collected on each videotape in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" being spread out among different seasons of the classic television situation comedy, then ""Europe Here We Come"" is different because these are all from Season Five and represent three of four consecutive episodes.  All of these episodes were written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, Bob Carroll, Jr. and the new additions to the staff that season of Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf, and all were directed by James V. Kern.  After the success of the ""trip"" to Hollywood, the show tried to up the ante by sending the cast to Europe:

Episode 137, ""Ricky's European Booking"" (First aired December 12, 1955) begins with Ricky and his band being booked for an extensive tour of Europe.  Fred gets to go alogn as the band manager, but Lucy and Ethel can only go if they can raise $3,000 to pay their own way.  So the girl form the Ladies Overseas Aid group (they are ladies, they want to go overseas, and they need aid) and plan to raffle off a television set.  An okay episode (the Ladies Overseas Aid joke is the best laugh in the show), but it is not like we doubt the girls are going to Europe.  Ricky and the singing group the Pied Pipers appear in the recording studio cutting ""Forever, Darling,"" which was the title of the second movie that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz released during the ""I Love Lucy"" years.

138, ""The Passports"" (First aired December 19, 1955) has a fairly simple premise.  To go to Europe everybody needs a passport.  To get a passport Lucy needs a copy of her birth certificate.  The only problem is that she cannot find one and the Jamestown Hall of Statistics has no record of her birth.  So all she needs is to find two people who can sign a statement attesting to the fact Lucy was born.  You have to pity the poor bureaucrats who try to stand between Lucy and a trip to Europe.  However, we do find out that Lucy is not a true redhead.  This is another average episode, so it is a good thing that this is a classic television series.

[What episode is missing?  That would be 139, ""Staten Island Ferry,"" which you can find on the ""Travel Plans"" volume of this collector's edition.  This is the one where Fred's fear of seasickness gets the rest of the gang to find a remedy that will not spoil the trip.  If you were going to cut one of these four, then this was the right choice to move to another volume, although it does have a somnambulant seasick Lucy.]

Episode 140, ""Bon Voyage"" (First aired January 16, 1956), starts with the Ricardos and the Mertzes all aboard the U.S.S. ""Constitution"" to head off to Europe.  But Lucy runs down the gangplank for one more goodbye to Little Ricky, who will be staying with grandma McGillicudy (Kathryn Card).  Of course, the ship takes off without Lucy, which means the redhead is desperate to get back aboard.  Can you say, helicopter?  Notice that is a young Jack Albertson as the helicopter dispatcher and for those of you interested in such things this episode marks the last time we see Mrs. Trumble (Elizabeth Patterson).  The chief attraction here is the helicopter lowering Lucy aboard the ship.",1114214400,,3183,4.551845342706502
1862233,5,B00008SCHJ,"One of the charms of ""I Love Lucy"" was that Ricky Ricardo was Cuban and periodically would launch into a tirade in Spanish while his wife would stop and stare at him.  For the ""Lucy Goes Cuban"" volume in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" the shoe is on the other foot as the redhead has to deal with Ricky's friends and family from Cuba.  Even better, there is more to these episodes than just reversing the situation so that Lucy is the linguistic outsider, which makes this one of the better volumes is this video collection that is organized thematically rather than chronologically.

Episode 28, ""Cuban Pals"" (Written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Davis, and Bob Carroll, Jr., First aired April 21, 1952) has the redhead turning green when she see Ricky's old dancing partner Renita Perez (Lita Baron).  It seems Renita was just a little girl during the old days back in Cuba, but now she has grown up.  A jealous Lucy in disguise follows the pair down to the Tropicana Club to keep them apart even though it was her idea Ricky and ""little Renita"" should dance together in his act, where she ends up with a dancing partner of her own.  The song in this episode is ""Lady in Red Similau,"" which was one of Desi Arnaz's hits before ""I Love Lucy.""  The song is certainly not ""Babalu"" or ""El Cumbanchero,"" and is not included on the album ""The Best of Desi Arnaz: The Mambo King,"" but it is pretty decent.

Episode 105, ""Lucy's Mother-in-Law"" (Written by  Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Davis, and Bob Carroll, Jr., First aired November 22, 1954) is one of my favorite sentimental episodes, although after the beautiful moment where Lucy goes down to the club to tell Ricky she is enciente, nothing is going to be a close second.  But I am charmed by the idea that Lucy is so desperate to impress Ricky's mother (Mary Emergy) when she comes from Cuba to visit her son and his zany wife.  But lucky is burning dinner and her best dress, not to mention losing Ricky's mother on the subway.  Of course, Mama Ricardo cannot speak English and Lucy cannot speak Spanish, but Lucy decides to speak Spanish at the dinner party for Mrs. Ricardo's friends.  Spanish lessons are not going to work, so Lucy gets Professor Bonanova (Fortunio Bonanova) to hide in the kitchen with a microphone while she is in the living room with a ear piece and he will tell her what to say to the absolute open-mouthed astonishment of Ricky.  Of course there are some rough moments when Lucy has to give the Professor hints as to what the right answer might be and other complications, but the pay off when Lucy's deceit is revealed is just sweet.

Episode 162, ""The Ricardos Visit Cuba"" (Written by Madelyn Davis, Bob Carroll, Jr., Bob Schiller, and Bob Weiskopf, First aired December 3, 1956) has the Ricardos and Mertzes on vacation and stopping in Cuba to visit Mama Ricardo (Mary Emery) and the family.  This time Lucy wants to impress Uncle Alberto (George Trevino), the head of the Ricardo family.  Once again, her best laid plans go horribly awry as she spills punch on him, ruins his expensive Cuban cigars, and manages to find the wrong thing to call him in Spanish.  Yes, everything is okay in the end, but it is always fun to watch Lucy try so hard and get such horrible results.  Ricky appears at Havana's Casino Parisian to sing ""I'm a Lucky Guy,"" and then he and Little Ricky do a version of ""Babalu"" that brings down the house and makes for a nice finale to this trio of ""I Love Lucy"" episodes.",1113609600,,3481,4.558587479935794
1862234,4,B00008SCHJ,"The idea in the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" is to have each videotape collection of three episodes from the classic situation comedy focus on a particular theme.  ""Going into Business"" offers a trio of episodes from the third and fourth season where Lucy and Ethel, then the Ricardos and the Mertzes, and then the redhead by herself, go into business and try to make some money.  There is money to be made, but usually not by Lucy and the gang, although one of these episodes will actually surprise you on that score.  All of these episodes were written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., with William Asher serving as the director trying to control the madness.

Episode 68, ""The Girls Go Into Business"" (First aired October 12, 1953) has Lucy and Ethel buying Hansen's Dress Shop so that they can go into business for themselves.  They think their biggest problem is what to call the shop (Do you prefer ""Ethe-Lu's"" or ""Lucy-Eth's""?  What about ""Lucy & Ethel's Dress Shop"" versus ""Ethel & Lucy's Dress Shop""?), but actually they have a more fundamental problem in that they cannot sell any dresses (except to each other).  Now the problem is to sell the shop before Ricky and Fred find out the girls have bought it in the first place.  There is a nice little punch line to this episode when the girls think they have actually come out ahead for once.  Ironically, the next episode of ""I Love Lucy"" was entitled ""Lucy and Ethel Buy the Same Dress.""

Episode 92, ""The Diner"" (First aired April 26, 1954) actually begins when Ricky decides he has had enough of show business and so the Ricardos and Mertzes buy a diner together that they name ""A Little Bit of Cuba.""  This should work, right?  Ricky has a recognizable name, while Fred and Ethel once worked as short-order cooks.  However, the Mertzes are not happy sweating away in the kitchen and serving as waiter while watching the Ricardos greet and seat the customers.  The next thing we know Lucy is suddenly doing the cooking and then there is a dividing line down the middle of the restaurant.  Keep in mind this is a restaurant and you can figure out how this one is going to end.  This one has a double punch line at the end.

Episode 100, ""The Business Manager"" (First aired October 4, 1954) finds Ricky tired of Lucy always messing up the household budget, especially when unpaid bills result in no electricity and no telephone.  So he hired a business manager (Charles Lane) to take charge.  He give Lucy a spending allowance and once she pays the bills there is $5 left.  Lucy can buy food or have her hair done, and we all know the redhead is not going to put up with that (especially once she loses the $5 on a bet with Ethel).  This is where Lucy comes up with this scheme where she buys groceries for her neighbors using the business manager's credit account and pockets the cash.  I know this sounds like it should work, but then you try explaining that to Ricky who thinks Lucy is playing the stock market (versus buying things at the market).  This episode stands out from the other two because the redhead actually comes out ahead at the end of this one, which is a welcome surprise.",1112918400,,3185,4.558875219683656
1862235,4,B00008SCHJ,"Lucille Ball's formidable talents as a physical comedienne are on display in this trio of episodes that focus on ""Lucy the Dancer"" for this ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" videotape (Not to be confused with the ""Shall We Dance"" volume).  All three of these episodes take place in Hollywood with the first two being from season four and the last from early in season five.  The writers for the first four seasons of ""I Love Lucy"" were the team of Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., with Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf joining the staff for the fifth season.  If you do not know who is playing Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel, then welcome to our planet.  We have much television for you to watch:

Episode 120, ""Bull Fight Dance"" (First aired March 28, 1955), starts with Ricky hosting a benefit for the Heart Fund on television.  Lucy wants to be part of the act and ends up blackmailing Ricky to get a song to sing.  The only problem is that she cannot handle the song and she ends being cast as the bull in Ricky's ""Fernando the Matador"" skit.  The bull is supposed to be fierce, but Lucy makes it look like Elsie, the Borden's cow.  This is a classic little bit of Lucy finally getting to upstage Ricky in an otherwise normal episode.  Fred and Ethel get to sing ""Dear Old Donegal"" for those of you who are working on putting together your greatest hits collection for the Mertzes.

Episode 125, ""The Dancing Star"" (First aired May 2, 1955), begins with Lucy's friend Caroline Appleby (Doris Singleton) stopping in L.A. on her way to Hawaii.  Lucy has been exaggerating what it is like in Hollywood and makes up a story about dancing with Van Johnson, who is appearing at the hotel.  Of course, Caroline would love to see that which means Lucy has to convince Johnson to make the lie come true.  The pair end up dancing to ""How about You?"" in another average episode, which makes it rather tepid when you consider the other Caroline episode is the one with Harpo Marx.  Johnson was a friend of Lucy and Desi having also worked on the 1940 film ""Too Many Girls"" where the couple first met.

Episode 130, ""Lucy and the Dummy"" (First aired October 17, 1955), has Lucy going to a big studio party where there will be lots of studio executives for her to impress.  Ricky was planning on going fishing so he refuses to perform at the party.  In an inspired bit, Lucy builds a Ricky dummy named ""Raggedy Ricky,"" using a realistic rubber head that the studio had made for makeup tests.  The only problem is that the dummy gets caught in her elaborate Spanish veil.  However, the crowd thinks she is some sort of comic genius.  Where does the dancing come in this time around?  Lucy does a solo song-and-dance number, ""I Get Ideas,"" which was one of Ricky's trademark numbers.  This was the last of the Hollywood episodes, with the Ricardos and Mertzes leaving for New York the following week.",1112313600,,2905,4.5442307692307695
1862236,5,B00008SCHJ,"Volume 1 of the ""Best of 'I Love Lucy'"" starts off with the classic ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial"" (Episode #30, May 5, 1952), Ricky is set to host a TV variety show and Lucy wants to do a live commercial for (all together now) Vitameatavegamin. Although she fails to win Ricky's support after staging a mock show inside their television set, Lucy arranges to get the gig anyhow. She starts off great, but the problem is that Vitameatavegamin contains 23% alcohol and with each rehearsal Lucy gets progressively drunker and funnier. Lucille Ball considered this the best bit, and one of the hardest, she ever did. Next we have the wonderful grape vat scene from ""Lucy's Italian Movie"" (Episode #150, April 16, 1956). The Ricardos are in Europe when an Italian movie producer tells Lucy that he wants her in his new film, ""Grapola Pungente."" Finding out the title translates as ""bitter grapes,"" Lucy takes this literally and heads for the nearest vineyard where she has a memorable encounter with Teresa Tirelli stomping grapes in a vat. So right off the start, you have TWO of the THREE funniest Lucy routines (and the Candy Factory sketch from ""Job Switching"" is on Volume 2).
The other three episodes might not all be classics, but they are still very, very funny. ""Lucy Does the Tango"" (Episode #173, March 11, 1957), finds the Ricardos and Mertzes investing in 200 laying hens. All you need to do is hear the situation and you know that Lucy is going to end up with end up with egg on her face. Okay, egg on everything. In ""The Freezer"" (Episode #29, April 28, 1952), Lucy and Ethel buy a new walk-in freezer. But when they grossly overestimate its capacity, they are suddenly in the meat business. Of course, as soon as you see that walk-in freezer you know Lucy is going to get locked in it. Finally, we have Lucy's legendary encounter with ""Harpo Marx"" (Episode #125, May 9, 1955), which showcases Lucille Ball's physical comedy in a great scene with the beloved silent Marx Brother. The mirror sequence between the two was apparently a pain to shoot (and reshoot), but worth the effort just to see the two famous ""redheads"" go at it.",1071187200,19,2138,4.658730158730159
1862237,5,B00008SCHJ,"I liked this set when I bought it, it's very nice and I really love the show. If you're not too set on paying the price then try looking for it on another shopping site. I sold my set like this on ebay for $45 and it was in mint condtion. This is a great set to have.",1232150400,,267,3.6206896551724137
1862238,5,B00008SCHJ,"This,in my oppinion,is the ONLY way to buy arguably the greatest television show ever to air on television;I Love Lucy.
You may or may not recall my review of the boxed set ""I Love Lucy;The Complete Series"".That sets includes very little the indivdual season sets don't. The main exception is the I Love Lucy movie,which may or may not get released seperately(cross our fingers).My bugaboo with the ""Complete Series"" was the way the discs were packaged and the fact I went through two and couldn't get one that didn't have play inhibiting scuff marks on some of the discs.
That was in April of this year(2008).Recently I thought I would try to get the series individually and I happily finally succeeded. All the discs of each season are housed in great slim packs which obviously lessens the chance of scratches and  scuff marks.
I wasn't prepared however for the extensive work that has been done on the show to bring it to DVD in such grand fashion. Each show has been remastered to such perfection that non one will have ever seen the show in such viewing clarity as it is here. Gone is that milky,out of focus look that plagued its' life in re runs. That alone to me would have been good enough but to say the producers of this set have gone above and beyond the call of duty,would be an understatement. Each disc has a bonus features section. In each are things like ""flubs"",""original openings"",""guest stars"",etc. They open and expand even further your knowledge of the series with material and information either not seen since the shows original debut or of things little known or unknown(until now)about the show. I can only say the bonus material alone leaves one permanently gobsmacked. It is astounding in its' length and breadth. Very few,if any,tv shows on DVD at this time can match the scope and superior nature of this series release material. Just one example of the lengths to which the producers went here is the re-insertion in a great many eps of the original lead-ins to commercials and show opening and closing animations. None of these things have been seen since their debut on the air.
This show,as everone knows by now,was the collaboration of two veterans of the screen and stage,Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Lucy the veteran actress was the inveterate pro in front of the camera,invariable always hitting her mark. Desi the band leader turned actor turned producer preferred his role behind the camera and worked his magic throughout that series well there. It was a pairing made in heaven but unfortunately time along with professional,and especially personal,differences slowly came between the two over the series run. It is interesting to watch Lucy in the sixth season and see a more serious looking person while in the 7-9th seasons Desi seems to take on the more serious look of the two.
I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It is a seminal show and,as I said,one of the greatest ever to air to television. From beginning to end the Desi,Lucy,Vivian and William quartet entertain us as no one ever has before or since. This series is lovingly and stunningly restored to perfection with a plethora of bonuses that will knock the socks off of even the most seasoned DVD consumer.
I am so happy that I finally bought the series in the way that I did. I found the individual seasons to be MY best route. What ever way YOU travel you won't want to miss this at all!",1226188800,,3406,4.72436974789916

Also, this little gem has a couple of the ""best"" songs Desi & his Orchestra ever performed, (excluding ""Cuban Pete"" and ""We're Having A Baby - My Baby And Me""), like ""The Lady In Red"" and ""I Get Ideas"". Plus, a couple of the best ""gags"" Lucille ever performed, like ""The Freezer"" with Lucy's froze-icicle-for-a-nose bit and the drunk-by-the-spoonful TV Commercial for ""Vitameatavegamin"" - A true ""classic"" that still stands alongside and beats out the best ep.s from ""The Honeymooners"", ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""All In The Family"", ""The Bob Newhart Show"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""... You name it, Lucy and Desi can beat it! A great DVD sampler for a great trip down ol' memory lane. And it's just long enough of a trip to leave you walking away still saying, ""I Love Lucy"".

The Seasons 1-6 DVD has great special features, and great picture and sound quality.

All of this, without a worry about f-bombs, or inappropriate topics or any of the social relevance that gets stuck onto TV comedy today.

From Vitameatavegemin to stomping grapes in Italy to the birth of her baby to stalking celebrities from Hollywood's Golden Age. 'I Love Lucy' is an American heirloom.",1179100800,4,670,4.767241379310345

1862259,5,B00008SCHJ,"Paramount Home Entertainment deserves oodles and oodles of back-slapping praise for the ""tender loving care"" treatment it has shown toward the pioneering television sitcom ""I Love Lucy"", and the remastering effort that has been put into all of the complete-season DVD boxed sets of that series.

In just a two-year period (2004-2006), Paramount released all six seasons of the series in deluxe, feature-packed DVD sets....and each season set looks just great.

The 180 black-and-white episodes that can be found in this ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Series"" 30-Disc mega-collection have been cleaned up to near-pristine clarity. The shows look gorgeous on all of these DVDs.

The ""Lost Pilot"" for ""Lucy"" is also included in this ""All Seasons"" set (and it has a lengthy running time of over 34 minutes too). The Pilot was evidently lost and unseen for decades, prior to a 16mm print of the program luckily being unearthed in 1990. The video quality of that Pilot broadcast is not up to par with the other regular episodes in this six-season collection, but it isn't terrible quality either.

Being able to see Lucy and Ricky Ricardo's first-ever episode on DVD is a real treat, and I'm glad that Paramount has put the Pilot on the Season-One set. It's great fun to see, especially the final scene with Lucy on stage with Ricky at Ricky's nightclub. The seemingly ad-libbed banter between Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz is fabulous. (As is the ""plunger"" gag, which was perfectly implemented by Lucy in that scene.)

I'll have to admit that when Paramount started issuing the full-season compilations of ""I Love Lucy"", I had no intention at all of buying all six seasons of the show. But after initially buying Seasons 4 and 5 (the years with the gang in Hollywood, which are my favorites), I found myself wanting all six seasons. The many bonus features that have been added to each of these DVD sets was certainly a major reason for my wanting to get all of the seasons.

In addition to the crystal-clear episodes themselves, this Complete-Series DVD aggregation sports a wide variety of fun-to-peruse supplemental items, such as:

38 Complete Episodes of Lucille Ball's Radio Show (""My Favorite Husband"");
Audio Commentary Tracks (on some discs);
Behind-The-Scenes Featurettes;
Lost Scenes;
Deleted Footage;
Script Excerpts;
Guest Cast Information;
Original Opening Credits;
Original Animated Sequences;
Restored Music;
Promotional Spots;
Production Notes;
Photo Galleries;
Song Selections;
Colorized Christmas Show Scenes (from Season 6);
Isolated Bloopers (i.e., clips from episodes containing goofs/flubs);
Spanish Audio Tracks (on most episodes).

Holy mackerel! It'd be hard to ask for more than the above large batch of extras for a TV series that first aired from 1951 to 1957, huh?

My favorite bonuses are the many ""My Favorite Husband"" full-length radio programs that have been included as audio extras on each and every DVD. As a rule, Paramount has placed one radio show on each disc, but some discs have more than one. The first-season set, in fact, contains a total of 13 radio shows. Very nice indeed.

As I mentioned, the fourth and fifth seasons of ""I Love Lucy"" are the top years of the series as far as my ""Lucy"" tastes are concerned. And I think a lot of other people concur with that assessment about the ""California Trip"" episodes being the best the series has to offer.

That's not intended to diminish the excellence of some of the other classic programs in the six-year life of this sitcom either, of which there were quite a few, without doubt. But the 20-plus episodes which had the Ricardos and the Mertzes living in Hollywood (in 1955) are the cream of the Lucy crop in my view. I find myself re-watching the Season-Four and Season-Five programs more than any others.

--------------------

""I Love Lucy"" has long been considered by many people to be the greatest television program ever to enter American living rooms. It was certainly trend-setting in a number of ways, including its multi-camera filming technique. That crazy-acting redhead named Lucy Ricardo has seemingly never lost her appeal.

And I kind of doubt she ever will lose that magic ""something"" that keeps viewers coming back to see her again and again in these 180 TV episodes that comprise the ""I Love Lucy"" franchise. With these six stupendous seasonal sets of ""ILL"" on the DVD market, how COULD any sitcom fan lose interest in Mrs. Ricardo and company?

So why not just quit fighting the temptation, and set aside the green stuff with which to purchase this darn-near-perfect ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Series"" DVD collection? Each and every episode has been well cared for on these DVDs, the packaging is great too, and there are so many bonus features here, it's difficult to know where to start.

Paramount Home Entertainment -- I salute you. These impeccable, jam-packed ""I Love Lucy"" sets are bound to get a lot of air time in my DVD player....for years to come.",1160179200,15,4962,4.97463768115942

There is nothing extra in this set that is not included in the individual sets, except for a fancy piece of cardboard on the bottom and some extra plastic wrap holding all of the sets together.  I really don't understand Amazon's pricing policy.  Their DVDs go dramatically up and down in price every week.  Just last week the ""I Love Lucy"" seasons were $45 each, making this complete series collection a good deal.  Now it is not worth it.  Buy them individually and save 50 bucks.

If you buy it, examine the DVDs and don't settle.  Maybe if these companies keep getting faulty product back, it will give them a reason to be more careful in manufacture.  Sadly, it's a hassle for Amazon, and not their fault.  When you open a factory sealed CD, it isn't all scratched and dirty, so why should DVDs be?  No excuse for this.  Also, the 13 Lucy/Desi specials should have been included in this set, they were really I Love Lucy shows, tho the title is different.  Id have been glad to pay extra to have those also included.

1862263,5,B00008SCHJ,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

30. ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial"":  One of the best episodes of all time with Lucy drinking too much Vitametavegamin for a TV commercial that Ricky begrudgingly allows her to do.

""I Love Lucy"" will remain a part of Americana forever. Though it has not been in production for 50 years, it continues to attract a new audience as people young & old are captivated by the extraordinary talents of Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley.  I therefore rate the ""I Love Lucy - The Complete Series"" on DVD with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1146873600,49,13511,4.801295896328294
1862264,5,B00008SCHJ,"What can I say that isn't already known about the best-loved sitcom in television history?  Well, it has a history of many firsts as its makers were pioneers in television.  They single-handledly invented the re-run.  They were also the first show to have a video club in VHS format for sale back in the late eighties.  I purchased those tapes and still own them, and waited for the day the full six seasons would be available on DVD.  I also own the 13 episodes of the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" on VHS, which were shot as once-a-month specials at the end of Lucy and Desi's run.  A separate DVD package for that makes sense, and we the fans look forward to its release (hey, while you're at it, guys, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy would be great too!).

So from the first episode shot (which aired as episode #3, entitled ""Lucy Thinks Ricky Wants To Murder Her"", to the final episode from season six, entitled ""Lucy Dedicates A Statue"", you now have the complete set, with a pristine and lovingly restored picture, and all the extras from each season DVD.

Here's something a lot of people are surprised to know when I tell them.  The advantage of watching all six seasons in a package like this is you see the story of the Ricardos and the Mertzes unfold, and the story has an arc, particularly for Lucy.  This is perhaps most evident in one particular Hollywood episode, when she is offered a golden opportunity.  But I won't give anything away here, you'll have to see what I mean!

Lucy collectors have been around since the beginning of the I Love Lucy phenomenon, and I think it's mainly because the show has heart.  The jokes never get old, and there is a genuine appeal - you can relate to the show no matter who you are or where you're from.  Sure, there was backstage controversy over the marriage which ended in divorce in 1960, and women's groups may quibble about how Lucy did not exactly move the women's movement forward, but it did what television does best:  reflect the times of our culture.  If anything Lucille Ball was quite the pioneer herself, as the first female TV Studio executive, navigating Desilu well into the 1970's.

Anyone who wants to see a master at play in situation comedy should take a good look at this collection.  In fact, the work of Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance (whom I may submit here as the greatest sidekick in sitcom history) and William Frawley presents the original Fab Four, way before Seinfeld.  These cats still show how it's done.",1144713600,131,2492,4.559550561797753
1862265,4,B00008SCHJ,"Besides being concerned with appearances, another key commonality between is that the first two of the three episodes on the ""Lucy the Glamour Girl"" volume of the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" were adopted from episodes of Lucille Ball's radio comedy, ""My Favorite Husband.""  ""I Love Lucy"" was supposed to be the television version of that successful program, which had Richard Denning as Lucy's husband.  But Ball insisted on having Desi Arnaz playing her husband on television and CBS did not like the idea.  They insisted that no one would believe Lucy had a Latin husband, and the fact that the two were really married took a while to seep through the brains of the network executives:

Episode 69, ""Lucy and Ethel Buy the Same Dress"" (First aired October 19, 1953), begins with Lucy trying to get the leading role in the revue staged by the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League, which is going to be aired on the local TV station run by Charley Appleby.  Lucy gets the star role when she promises that Ricky will emcee the show.  Unfortunately Ricky has sworn that he will not perform in any more of the shows at Lucy's womens club, no matter what, but the Redhead can take care of that obstacle.  But it turns out that Ethel also wants to be the star of the show and even worse, as the title indicates, the two show up wearing the same dress (which is pretty strange given how dreadful the dress in question looks on both of them).  Lucy and Ethel sing Cole Porter's ""Friendship,"" an ironic choice given how mad they are at each other when they sing it (Lucille Ball had sung the song a decade earlier in the MGM musical ""DuBarry Was a Lady"") and Ricky sings ""Vaya con Dios.""  The episode was based, in part, on the ""My Favorite Husband"" radio episode, ""Liz Appears on Television.""

Episode 76, ""Changing the Boys' Wardrobe"" (First aired December 7, 1953), has Lucy and Ethel sit and tired of the boys insisting on wearing comfortable clothing (e.g., Ricky's Havana U. sweatshirt) when they take the girls to the movies.  So the girls take the offensive clothing to a used clothing store, forcing Ricky and Fred to wear their newer clothes.  Of course the boys figure out what is going on, but when Ricky retrieves his beloved bad clothing and the girls despite to stoop to the level of the boys, Fate has a nice little lesson in store for the quartet.  The only problem is that Ricky usually dresses so nattily that it seems strange he would go out in public dressed grungily.  This episode was based in part on the radio episode, ""Husbands Are Sloppy Dressers.""

Episode 147, ""Lucy Gets a Paris Gown"" (First aired March 19, 1956) is from the fifth season when the Ricardos and Mertzes were in Europe.  Lucy wants a designer dress from Paris designer Jacques Marcel.  Ricky says no, so Lucy goes on a hunger strike until he capitulates and buys her the dress.  Of course, Ethel is sneaking her food, but you know how sad Lucy can look when the spirit moves her.  However, once Ricky gives in, her discovers what is going on and so he and Fred decide to pay back the girls by getting them both ""designer"" gowns.  The twist?  They will present Lucy and Ethel with horrendous gowns--even worse than the ones in ""Lucy and Ethel Buy the Same Dress"" since they are essentially made of burlap--and tell them they are the latest cutting edge Paris originals.

Nothing here is a classic, but you do get a trio of solid examples of the landmark situation comedy.  Lucy has a plan, it goes awry, and then things get worse.  But when you are dealing with a comic genius like Lucille Ball and the solid ensemble work provided by Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley, you can see what these shows are going to be rerun until the end of time.  The first two episodes, from the show's third season, were written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr., while the last one finds Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf added to the show's writing staff.",1122595200,,3962,4.577903682719547
1862266,4,B00008SCHJ,"The chief attraction of the three episodes collected under the ""Precarious Predicaments"" title for this volume of the ""'I Love Lucy' Collector's Edition"" would be the one time we get to hear Ricky sing the lyrics to the show's theme song.  These are standard examples of the classic television situation comedy, none of them classic (despite the song singing), but all of them worth the watching.  The first two episodes were written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., while the third gets credited to Pugh, Carroll, Bob Schiller, and Bob Weiskopf.

Episode 55, ""Lucy Becomes A Sculptress"" (First aired January 12, 1953) would be better entiled ""Lucy Becomes a Sculpture.""  Lucy thinks that Little Ricky should be an artist so she goes to an art store where the clerk (Leon Belasco) gives her some modeling clay and pretends that she is a gifted artist so he will make a sale.  Convinced she is an artistic genius, Lucy goes home and the only person she can convince to pose for her is Fred, much to his regret.  The result is not good so Ricky insists that an art critic will come over and judge Lucy's work.  Lucy tries to make a bust of herself and when that does not work she decides the best think to do is cover her head in powder and stick it through a hole in a table.  Thus we get to the precarious predicament part of the episode and the set up for the inevitable (and funny) payoff.

Episode 60, ""Lucy's Last Birthday"" (May 11, 1953) has the poor redhead convinced that everybody has forgotten her birthday (the title comes from when Lucy tells Mrs. Trumbull that she had her ""last birthday"" a year ago today, which means she has reached the age when women stop counting birthdays).  So she sits all alone on a park bench where she is consoled by a ""The Friends of the Friendless"".  Lucy takes her new friends to the club to give her friends a piece of her mind as they sit there looking at her sitting around a giant birthday cake.  This is the one where Ricky sings the ""I Love Lucy"" theme song with lyrics written by Harold Adamson:

I love Lucy and she loves me,

We're as happy as two can be,

Sometimes we quarrel, but then,

How we love making up again.

Lucy kisses like no one can,

She's my misses and I'm her man,

And life is heaven you see,

'cause I love Lucy, yes I love Lucy,

And Lucy loves me.

Episode 164, ""Lucy and the Loving Cup"" (First aired January 7, 1957) comes up with a precarious predicament when Ricky makes it clear he does not like Lucy's new hat.  To show her husband she puts on the loving cup that Ricky is going to be presenting to jockey Johnny Longden at a big dinner.  If you do not know that Lucy cannot get the trophy off her head, then these must be the first three episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" that you have ever seen in your entire life (How do you like them so far?).  To make things even more interesting, Lucy gets lost on a NYC subway in this condition provides yet another example of the proficiency of Lucille Ball at physical comedy.",1116720000,,3014,4.377697841726619
