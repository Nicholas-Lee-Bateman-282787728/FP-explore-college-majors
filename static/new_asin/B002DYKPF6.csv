3914485,5,B002DYKPF6,"The cartoon we all love is back with a new release, continuing where the Phoenix Saga left off.  These are the original versions, not the syndicated versions aired on Disney-XD.  Personally, I'm on the fence as to whether or not I prefer the syndicated versions or the original.  The syndicated versions show no cuts for content (these episodes were NEVER longer than 22 minutes, including the intro and outro) but do show some corrections of animation mistakes.  For example, in ""Savage Land, Strange Heart (Part 1)"" (which was later changed to ""Savage Land, Savage Heart (Part 1)"" for the syndicated edition) Sauron's dialog is incorrectly dubbed to Ka-Zar's lips during their confrontation.  This was fixed in the syndicated version.  Another example is in ""Savage Land, Strange Heart (Part 2)"" where Storm, in a fit of rage, tears off her communicators.  The communicators stay on sfter she grumbles ""leave me alone"" but as it cuts to a new angle they are missing.  This was also fixed in the syndicated version.  However, disregarding these subtle differences, I encourage any X-Men fan to purchase the series on DVD.  Many of us have waited a long time for this.",1253750400,,1168,4.943589743589744
3914486,2,B002DYKPF6,"I was so happy to buy the 3rd and 4th volume of X-Men on DVD. Granted I am very upset that these people who put out these DVD's can't seem to keep them the way we remember watching them on TV. My Examples of this are Transformers put out by Rhino and now by Shout Factory I am hearing there are still issues with these, Captain N The Game Master was messed up on release (whole parts of episode cut out) also made by Shout Factory, and now finally X-Men. I read some of your reviews and didn't realize that an episode was left out ""No Mutant Is An Island"". Good luck getting that missing episode as a special feature on volume 5. I also noticed that some little scenes on certain episodes were left out from the tv versions, for example on the ""Courage"" episode when Morph is in the cave at the end fighting Master Mold, there is a second flashback where he is being shot by the Sentinels showing his fear of fighting master mold. I checked my vhs tape after making sure I remembered this scene correctly and sure enough I was right, it was left out. I also noticed voice changes on Phoenix Saga with some of the characters and the music is different from the tv version. Some of the shots from a gun or lazer fire didn't transfer correctly from say a gun, a robot would get hit but there was no firing of the weapon. I agree with the reviews some of you say they should have done better, I agree and don't understand why we can't have what we remembered enjoying on TV.",1253750400,8,1470,4.216312056737588
3914487,1,B002DYKPF6,"The X-Men animated series are awesome but it really bugs me to see that Buena Vista Home Entertainment has put zero effort into these DVD releases. From the cheap artwork to the incorrect order of the episodes. We have been waiting YEARS for this series to be released on DVD. After seeing the high demand of the first 2 volumes, they could have at least made sure they were doing things right!

First, On the artwork for Volume 2 (""Featuring the Phoenix Saga"") They have Dark Phoenix on the cover. In Volume 3 (""Featuring The Dark Phoenix"") You can clearly see Phoenix is wearing the first costume with the black V underneath the phoenix logo. Wrong Phoenix's depicted on both volume covers. No disc artwork, No booklets, no inserts. Nada.

The episodes are all out of order on volumes 3 and 4. They could have corrected the episode order and we would have still had the same amount of episodes per release if that is what they were concerned about!!! Correct episode order is and should have been released as follows:

Volume 3

34. No Mutant Is an Island

43. The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Fate Of The Phoenix
44. Orphan's End
45. The Juggernaut Returns
46. Love In Vain
47. A Deal With The Devil

Volume 4
(Disc 1)
48. Sanctuary (Part 1)

3914488,3,B002DYKPF6,"Disney left out an episode called ""No Mutant Is An Island"" in which Cyclops leaves the X-Men because of the loss of Jean and goes back to the orphanage where he grew up to find that a purple man is using mutant orphans to do his dirty work. Boom-boom, Tabitha Smith is one of these mutant children. Pretty careless Disney or is it a marketing ploy to rerelease volume 3. Not cool.",1253404800,2,380,4.291666666666667
3914489,5,B002DYKPF6,"""Born to protect a world that hates and fears them"" pretty much sums up what the X-Men are all about, and volume 3 of Fox's smash animated series from the 90's is no different.  What is really worth noting about the episodes collected here in this volume is that it features the four-part ""Dark Phoenix Saga"", AKA the grandaddy of all X-Men storyarc events.  Though the conclusion of the saga was altered in animated form as opposed to the comics, it still manages to pack quite a punch.  Also featured here are the first appearances of classic fan favorite characters Nightcrawler and Iceman, Wolverine once again tackles his past time with Weapon X, and the saga involving Cable and Apocalypse continues as well.  Also featured here is the two-parter ""One Man's Worth"", in which Bishop and his sister Shard attempt to stop an assassin from killing Professor Xavier in the past.  All in all, volume 3 of Fox's animated X-Men series is just as great as it ever was, and is wholeheartedly worth your time.",1248566400,3,1004,4.714285714285714
3914490,5,B002DYKPF6,"Don't get me wrong, I love this show, but they could atleast take the time and put the episodes in the way they were meant to be seen. See, during X-men run, they had alot of prduction problems, animation etc. So some episodes were airing in random order. So when it comes time to release the dvd volumes 3 & 4 they just slap the episodes on dvd (with great art work btw) and ship it to retailers. Disney could have taken 30 minutes out of their day and given us proper episode order of this marvel classic.",1246838400,,507,4.183673469387755
3914491,5,B002DYKPF6,"I am a child of the '90's, growing up in a time when television was in something of a golden age -- the action was kicking harder, the humor was getting funnier but was still fresh and clean, and landmark shows such as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" were getting their starts. Among this age, FOX network created FOXkids!, a viewing block that aired in the afternoons after school let out and also on Saturday mornings. Within this time, ""X-Men: The Animated Series"" came into being.

Dealing with large social issues such as prejudice and good vs. evil, ""X-Men"", like the comics the show was based on, wrapped these issues in fun packaging with ""mutants"" and ""super powers."" Going on to be one of the most successful cartoons in FOX's history, ""X-Men"" ran for a phenomenal five seasons. This is the first time that these beloved episodes are available in high-quality DVD format.

Volume Three of this collection picks up where Volume Two left off -- the Phoenix Saga, one of the greatest of all comic book story arcs. Jean Grey joined with the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force and sacrificed her life to save the universe. Now, the Phoenix has been driven mad by Jean's humanity and her telepathic powers, helped by the mental manipulations of the sinister Inner Circle club, beginning the start of the epic Dark Phoenix Saga.

Follow the X-Men as they fight for Jean Grey's soul, as Apocalypse rises and the battle not only evil but prejudice and social adversity time and time again. Featuring everyone's favorite comic characters (from Nightcrawler to Iceman to Archangel, to Cable and Apocalypse and Magneto), Volume Three will continue to delight fans of both comic and show.

Although there are regrettably no special features, these DVD collections -- with a price tag of $15 a piece -- are well worth collecting as a shining example of a time when television was more than just reality shows and sexual humor; a time when the media was relevant.

5 out of 5 stars.",1246320000,20,1978,4.755102040816326
3914492,5,B002DYKPF6,"In my opinion, X-Men, Batman TAS, Spider-Man, Animaniacs, Power Rangers, Eek the Cat, Bobby's World, Tiny Toons and all the other shows that were featured on Fox Kids were the very best shows. X-Men, in spite of being a Saturday morning cartoon gathered very high ratings. In fact, it was so successful that it ran for a whopping 76 episodes with a total of 5 seasons, all the way from 1992 to 1997. In fact, it is the longest running Marvel animated show with Spider-Man being the second longest. X-Men has often been compared to Batman the Animated Series in terms of quality.

We can now witness more adventure as episodes from season 3 and 4 are now being released. X-Men closely followed some storylines from the comics. In this one, we witness the Dark Phoenix Saga in which Jean Grey is consumed by the Phoenix Force but is her dark evil side. We'll also see the X-Men clash in an epic battle with the immortal god-like mutant Apocalypse and even battle Sauron's army in the prehistoric Savage Land.

X-Men is something for all ages. Kid and teens will love the action and adventure, while adults will appreciate the well written episodes and how some of them follow the comics. And of course, everybody will appreciate the top-quality animation created by some of the greatest animation studios of the day and everyone will love the nicely drawn awesome looking characters who bear great resemblance to the X-Men of comic book artist Jim Lee and writer Chris Claremont.

In case you're a fan of X-Men, Marvel, good action, emotional scenes or epic battles of good vs evil or if you even watched this on Fox Kids during the fantastic era of the 90s, don't miss X-Men! If you got the first volume and volume 2, then I,m sure you'll adore volume 3 and volume 4 and if you haven't experienced X-Men, it might just be a good time to grab both new volumes and prepare for epic adventures featuring Marvel's mutant team.

Here are the episodes in this volume:

Obsession: Archangel, who originally was Angel seeks revenge on Apocalypse for turning him into on of his horsemen. The X-Men assist him with the use of Apocalype's own ship.

3914493,5,B002DYKPF6,"After the release of Volumes 1 & 2 most fans were ecstatic to be able to own the first three and a half seasons of this classic animated series on studio released DVD. The problem with Disney is you can never tell if they will finish releasing a series or cancel it because of poor sales or God knows why. Luckily fans of this series will be able to collect more episodes this September 22nd with the further release of X-men: The Animated Series with Volumes 3 & 4. Volume three is confirmed to contain the following fifteen episodes from the third and fourth seasons of the show spread across two discs:

Disc 1
34 Savage Land, Strange Heart (1)
35 Savage Land, Strange Heart (2)
36 Obsession
37 Dark Pheonix: Dazzled (1)
38 Dark Pheonix: The Inner Circle (2)
39 Dark Pheonix: The Dark Pheonix (3)
40 Dark Pheonix: The Fate Of The Pheonix (4)

Disc 2
41 Cold Comfort
42 Orphan's End
43 The Juggernaut Returns
44 Nightcrawler
45 Weapon X, Lies and Videotape
46 One Man's Worth (1)
47 One Man's Worth (2)
48 Courage

Really every episode from this series can be considered a fan favorite but more noticable in this collection is the four part Dark Pheonix Saga as well as Weapon X, Lies and Videotape, Nightcrawler and Obsession.

The audio & video quality we can expect will be the same as that of the first two volumes. Episodes tended to be in the same quality they aired with minor compression issues that go unnoticed by most and didn't impede on my personal viewing enjoyment. Also the further we go into the series we should notice a slow steady improvement on the actual animation quality.

There are regrettably no special features on these volumes but given the fact we're dealing with Disney that was to be expected. TELEVISION WAS BETTER IN THE NINETIES. Thanks for your time.

3914677,5,B002DYKPF6,"I will say this, I'm very impressed by the quality of the DVD. I was expect a lot less from something so out dated. They converted the original 4x3 aspect ratio to 16x9 so it looks perfect on you new TV. Even though the show was not originally in HD the re-mastering still shows. The picture looks and sounds great for something that was released in the early 90's.

  I bought all the Volumes to get me hyped for the new X-Men movie. Since I receive my collection I've been watching non-stop. There are more episode than I remember, which is great because I don't think I had a chance to see them all when it was on TV. All the episodes are in order too, that's awesome because that was the biggest problems I had with the show when it was still on TV!

  If you're having a sense of nostalgia, I highly recommend getting this DVD. It brought back so many memories, and lets face facts, we all tried to be Wolverine while sliding three knives between our fingers as a kid. Even if you weren't around for the Animated Series but are a fan of the movies, it's good to see where the X-Men films stem from. It's also good to see what it is that's getting all the older generation so upset every time the movie go off course lol.

  To the parents out there, this show still holds up, it's not like it's in Black and White. I favored the show as a kid, and I still favor it as an adult (I consider myself a cool guy lol). I'm definitely introducing X-Men to my kids too.",1402876800,4,1466,4.170212765957447

3914702,5,B002DYKPF6,"Another volume of my personal favorite animated series based on a comic book.  This volume is another great collection, with only 1 episode below A.  I'm tempted to knock a star off for excuding No Mutant Is An Island, but that's on Volume 5, so I can't really complain.  Just remember, buy or rent Volume 5 & watch that episode before you see this volume because it's an epilogue to the Phoenix Saga.  Here's a review of each story, with synopsizes from Marvel Animation Age.

34-35.  Savage Land, Savage Heart:  Sauron, a shape-shifting mutant, kidnaps Storm and brings her to the Savage Land in order to feed from her mutant energy.  Separated from the rest of the X-Men, Storm is encouraged by Sauron to free her inner tempest of energy, awakening a being called Garokk!  A great 2-part story.  A

36.  Obsession: Archangel has become obsessed with destroying Apocalypse, who he blames for ruining his life.  Meanwhile, Beast has developed a new device that could contain Apocalypse and allow the X-Men to finally defeat him.  Will Beast's device work? Will Archangel become an ally for the X-Men? Or will Archangel's hunger for revenge cause the destruction of both himself and the X-Men at Apocalypse's hands?  An excellent episode.  A+

37-40.  The Dark Phoenix Saga:  The Phoenix continues to inhabit Jean's body, brazenly taking over at will.  When the Inner Circle Club discover the extent of the Phoenix's power, they use Jason Wyngarde to create a new history in the mind of the confused Jean Grey.  Wyngarde creates a fictional romance between them set in the past and leads Jean to believe that what she perceived as the present actually occurred in her dreams.  When the X-Men come to rescue Jean, they find that the person they came to rescue might actually be the one to cause their destruction!  I'm going to be honest with you, the first episode could've been better, but once they get to the Inner Circle Club, it gets really good & stays that way for the rest of the story.  If it weren't for that, this could've been the best episode of the show.  A

41.  Cold Comfort:  Former X-Man Bobby 'Iceman' Drake is caught breaking into a top-secret government installation.  The X-Men are notified of the incident, free him and bring him back to the X-Mansion.  While there, the X-Men discover that Iceman's longtime girlfriend, Lorna Dane was kidnapped.  Iceman's only appearance is a memorable one.  A+

42.  Orphan's End:  Cyclops discovers that a man on the run from the Shi'Ar authorities, Corsair, may be his father.  Desperate to find answers, Cyclops helps Corsair elude the Shi'Ar.  However, he is unable to shake his distrust and eventually turns Corsair in.  But something doesn't seem right, and Cyclops promptly realizes that he may have just made the biggest mistake of his life!  Even though we already knew that Corsair was Cyclops' father that just made the episode all the more interesting.  A

43.  The Return of the Juggernaut:  Juggernaut's life is at risk when someone else uncovers the Ruby of Cyttorak and claims the powers of Juggernaut...to pick up girls.  Faced with the dilemma of helping a dangerous man, Cyclops and Wolverine go on a mission to find the impostor and retrieve the source of Juggernaut's power.  A great episode with some funny moments.  Look for a Power Rangers parody in the background.  A

44.  Nightcrawler:  Gambit, Rogue, and Wolverine take a ski trip to Germany.  While on the trip, Wolverine hears reports of a demon hiding in a local monastery and after investigating finds the mutant, Nightcrawler!  Fearful of his appearance, the townsfolk attack and burn the monastery where he lives.  Determined to help this new mutant, the X-Men set out to convince the townsfolk that mutantkind should not be feared.  This is easily the single greatest episode of the show, & one of the greatest episodes I've seen in any animated series ever.  As a Christian, I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw this episode for the first time.  It's so rare for a kid's show to handle a topic like this with such care.  A+

45.  Weapon X, Lies and Videotape:  A cryptic postcard unleashes a flood of maddening and painful memories in Wolverine that threaten to drive him insane.  To keep his mind from being torn apart, Wolverine and Beast travel to the one location that may hold the answers to his hidden past: the ruins of the top-secret Weapon X lab.  A Wolverine-focused episode, what more could you ask for?  A+

46-47.  One Man's Worth:  Trevor Fitzroy and Bantam are ordered by Master Mold to travel back in time to 1959 and kill Professor X.  This creates an ""alternate present"" where a human-mutant war has caused the fall of civilization.  Led by Magneto, the mutants fight an unending battle with the humans for the right to survive.  Bishop and Shard arrive to the alternate present and realize that they must attempt to go back in time to prevent Professor X's assassination and save the world!  Another excellent time-travel episode.  A+

48.  Courage:  The day Morph rejoins the X-Men, terrorists attack a top-secret, high-tech weapons factory.  Morph and Wolverine investigate and discover that the Sentinels are back and bent on destroying the mutants.  Haunted by flashbacks of his previous encounter with the Sentinels, Morph is forced to face his fears to help the X-Men.  Morph was always one of my favorites, so it was great to see him back in the fold, even if it was temporary.  A+

If anyone asks me why I like this series over Batman TAS, I just point them to the episode Nightcrawler, and the rest speaks for itself.  I'm a True Believer, through and through.  Any X-Men fan should have all of this series in their collection.",1369440000,,5711,4.781314168377824

The Dark Phoenix Saga was both a huge triumph & an over dramatic short-coming.  This saga had one of the most powerful creatures in Marvel history as well as X-men history, key battles between the X-men & Shiiar SF, but the drama took away from all of that probably because it is hard to make an animation as good as a comic.  This volume did succeed in the Weapon X project & Apocalypse shorts with their only draw back being they were too short.

They've changed the ending credits (now a blue background with previews of another episode, rather than the ""Cerebro 3-D"" versions of each character that we saw on Fox), which I don't care for. I also would have liked it if they could've stuck with some original art from the series for the box covers. There have also been complaints of them cutting footage from certain episodes.

Best of all, though, would have been for them to issue the show by season, with episodes in chronological order as originally shown. Instead we get parts of different seasons in each disc. Why break up the seasons? Lame move, Disney.

Still, I give them epic props for making my favorite show readily available again. Even flawed X-Men AS is better than no X-Men AS, right?",1268611200,2,862,4.484076433121019

3914727,4,B002DYKPF6,"Disney has done the surprising and has apparently committed to releasing an entire series worth of one of its cartoons.  Of course, this comes with a price.  Disney, caring only for its profit line, has chosen to give us the X-Men series but without any bells and whistles.  These are the episodes as they appeared on television in the 1990's.  There no visual or audio enhancements, no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no interviews with the cast, crew, or creators.  The only noteworthy addition would be the original, and attractive, cover art for each volume.  Of course, if you have purchased Volumes 1 and 2 then you are already aware of this.  Truth be told, I enjoy the extra ""fluff"" thrown into most releases but what truly matters to me is having the episodes themselves on DVD, so in that regard, I am satisfied.  The price is reasonable as well, I've had no trouble finding these releases for well under 20 dollars, though their list price is much higher.

At any rate, I could rattle on and on about the sub-par presentation as other classic series are sold at the same price and look much better (Ghostbusters is the first that comes to mind) but it is what it is.  The episodes are what matter most and here Volume 3 does not disappoint.  There are quite a number of fan favorites and personal favorites on these discs.  Most likely will be excited to have The Dark Phoenix Saga to pair with Volume 2's Phoenix Saga.  I personally enjoy Iceman's lone episode, ""Cold Comfort,"" and made-for-TV character Morph's reintroduction on the episode ""Courage.""  The two-part ""One Man's Worth"" is the series first take on The Age of Apocalypse, a popular arc in the comic books during the series run.  The not included on this set four part ""Beyond Good and Evil"" is a sort of spiritual Age of Apocalypse in which Apocalypse manipulates time in an effort to destroy the universe, and so on.  It really only relates to the Age of Apocalypse in that Apocalypse is at the wheel.  ""One Man's Worth"" takes the foundation of AoA, a time traveler kills Xavier before he forms the X-Men, and the resulting impact on the world.  Only in this case, Apocalypse has nothing to do with it and the result is a war between mankind and mutant-kind.  We get a look at the resulting world and a lot of the character designs are lifted from AoA and it turns into a pretty engaging story.  I would have liked to see this two-parter expanded into another four part series but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

Some other highlights include the introduction of Nightcrawler who gets his own self-titled episode, Archangel's return in ""Obsession,"" and some more backstory involving Wolverine in ""Weapon X: Lies and Videotapes.""  The episodes are well done though the same issues still persist in regards to consistency (some characters will be colored wrong or minor continuity errors arise).  These errors are superficial and serve only as distractions and are commonplace in pretty much every cartoon series.  The series did pretty much completely drop its serial-styled run in that all episodes are mostly self-contained.  This is the style the show would adopt for the remainder of its run: multi-part arcs with standalone episodes mixed in.  A few episodes do reference prior ones, such as ""Obsession"" and ""Courage,"" but it would be fairly easy for someone to jump right in if they so desired.

Sadly, this Volume in some ways represents the last of the great episodes spawned by this series.  That is not to say that what follows is garbage by any means, but the show will soon start to suffer creatively as it tries to sustain itself beyond its expectations.  If you own the first two volumes this should already be in your collection.  If you're on the fence I give you full permission to purchase this as well.  If you've never experienced the show then start with Volume 1 as it serves as the introduction to the series and is still the best collection of episodes.  If you don't care about cartoons or the X-Men, then why did you read this far?",1266624000,,4046,4.703125
3914728,4,B002DYKPF6,"Being a fan of the series back when it originally aired, I was pretty excited to see it released on DVD.  The episodes are as I remember them.  If there have been any changes or omissions, I can't tell.  The animation quality is good and seems to get better in this volume.  I noticed that it seems cleaner & sharper on Disc 2.

We get some great episodes in this set, my favorites being ""Weapon X, Lies, And Video Tape"" in which Wolverine uncovers the secret behind many of his memories; and ""One Man's Worth (Parts 1 & 2)"" where Wolverine and Storm travel back & forth through time to save Professor X.  I always thought they'd be good together.  We also get to see a few more characters such as Iceman/Bobby Drake, Archangel/Warren Worthington, Nightcrawler/Kurt Wagner, Juggernaut/Cain Marko, Apocolypse, and others.  I always enjoy learning about the lesser known characters.

There seemed to be a few tweaks to the style of the episodes at this point.  Beast starts wearing this multifunctional backpack thing, Storm's hair is occasionally in a ponytail, and they move towards single episodes rather than the multi-parters.

Overall, I really enjoyed this release.  It is a bit disappointing that there are no special features but judging from other Marvel releases, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I've been unimpressed with their SF in the past.  Until they improve, I'd rather not have them.",1264291200,,1405,4.8734177215189876
3914729,5,B002DYKPF6,"This is undoubtably one of the greatest cartoons of all time. I grew in the 90's watching Batman the animated series, along with Spider-man, and what separates this show from those two classics is it's mature theme of PREJUDICE. I love how this show can be viewed by both adults and children alike. I pity kids growing up now..they don't write/make cartoons like this anymore!",1255996800,,376,4.8
3914730,5,B002DYKPF6,"If you bought and enjoyed Volume 1 & 2 then you have to purchase volume 3 & 4.  Volume 3 contains some of my favorite episodes that I remember when I was a kid in the 90's.  The episode titled Nightcrawler is incredibly well done and introduces one of the X-mens most popular characters (even though I feel he should have been introduced earlier and had more episodes where he appeared). With that being said, all of the episodes are fun and enjoyable to watch, even the Morlock Little X-mas episode which is incredibly corny.  Face it, if you're a fan of the X-men series in the 90's you're gonna want to have the entire collection.",1255651200,,633,4.439655172413793
3914731,4,B002DYKPF6,"Marvel characters know that power has a price. Spider-Man knows that with power comes great responsibility. The X-Men, their fellow mutants and various foes, all grapple with the consequences of their powers, whether for good or evil. Storm in fact, is especially challenged in a four-parter called ""The Dark Phoenix"" in which she finds herself in an evil role -- and kind of like it. This inner turmoil can be pretty deep stuff. The DVD's are rated Y7, clearly for older kids, teens and adults. It's pretty intense stuff, well executed and a great way to get to know these interesting characters well.",1254960000,,602,4.854368932038835
3914732,5,B002DYKPF6,"Very little of this series was anything like the comics at the time. The voices fit the characters very well with a few excetions... some accents were just PAINFULL!

The stories were VERY good... all my favorite characters were shown, even if they were guest stars. They got the ages correct (unlike the current X-Men programs).. I have been EAGERLY waiting for them to complete this series on DVD! This is a shinning example of what can be created with superheros if everyone tries their best!

One question: What is the deal with cutting out the production company's LOGO at the end of each episode?",1253923200,,602,4.723809523809524
3914733,5,B002DYKPF6,"The team of good mutants named Beast, Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Rogue, Jean Grey, and Professor Charles Xavier are still struggling to fight for mutant rights and fight those bad ones that want to harm the human race for good.
