3616977,4,B001GOEY9M,"This is a fairly well composed artistic montage of images and words (speaking and writing) set to the same music as ""Matter of Heart."" Therefore, while it does stand on its own as a presentation of Jung and the ideas of his psychology,  I regard it as a companion to that other work that focuses on the man himself. In this work there are a lot more clips of Jung speaking from the 1957 interview on various subjects such as childhood, fantasy, myth, archetypes, persona, the mandala, and so on. It concludes with a wonderful display of his ""confession of faith in stone"" at Bollingen and a translation of the inscription on the square (or cube-like) piece that had been mistakenly delivered for the cornerstone of his tower garden wall. It is a beautiful poem that sums up Jung's life and philosophy.",1254268800,38,801,4.640845070422535
3616978,5,B001GOEY9M,"Jung talks about the importance of day dreaming, fantasies and dreams. He also talks about how those can created our reality which in turn creates de-ja-vu moments. Highly recommended for everyone.",1236470400,19,197,5.387096774193548
3616979,5,B001GOEY9M,It is a very good presentation to Carl Gustav Jung's psychological ideias and his impact in the modern world.,963446400,17,109,4.7894736842105265

8306399,5,B001GOEY9M,Great film!,1432339200,,11,5.0
8306400,5,B001GOEY9M,Carl Jung has a heavy accent so it requires two showings to be understood.  I learned allot more about Jung's ideas and it was very interesting - well worth seeing more than once.,1425686400,,179,4.424242424242424
8306401,1,B001GOEY9M,"This film consists of excerpts from Evan's interesting interview with Jung, but interspersed with horribly meaningless and lengthy graphics.  In the end, not worth watching and certainly not worth using in a classroom.  Bottom line: Junk.  Much better to simply view the original unedited interview.",1412899200,,299,5.6
8306402,3,B001GOEY9M,Whoever did the cutting on this production put in way too many horrific scenes of Man's Inhumanity To Man.  You watch happily listening to the Great Man giving you insights into interesting facets of his work then it cuts to a sickening bit of footage from a war or genocide.  Why did someone think this added to or made the film more interesting?  Beats me.  I have yet to be able to get through the entire program and will go back to reading works on Jung.  It could have been so great.  Maybe if you just played it without looking at the screen.  I might be able to just listen to it but then why buy a DVD?  Such a pity.,1384473600,,624,4.099173553719008
8306403,2,B001GOEY9M,I expected quality similar to A&E's biography of Freud (which changed my perspective on Freud).  I am hoping that A&E has a biography on Jung of similar quality.,1361836800,,161,4.75
8306404,5,B001GOEY9M,"I just watched this dvd: ""The World within: CG Jung in his own words' again. Each time I watch it I receive other thoughts of Carl Jung who is not easy to read but love his thoughts and process.  He is a enlightened 'aware' person trying to express it honestly and openly.  Not to be missed. If cannot afford it, please recommend your library get aa copy to loan. A multi layered 'art' piece itself. And you get to see Jung's paintings and images which are MAGNIFICENT!  loved.",1344297600,4,477,4.3977272727272725
8306405,5,B001GOEY9M,"For anyone interested in the work of Carl Jung, this short film is a treasure. In both vivid imagery & Jung's own words, spoken to various interviewers in the 1950s, we get a good overview of Jung not only as psychologist, but as philosopher as well. What comes through is the incredible depth & richness of the human psyche, and just how little we truly know of our own inner selves. We'd like to think that the conscious, self-aware ego is firmly in control ... but that's seldom the case, as we've all found out to our sorrow at one point or another. Jung makes us see that becoming a whole human being isn't a matter of social conformity, of knocking off the rough edges so we'll fit smoothly into a pre-cut pigeonhole, but of being true to ourselves. But first we've got to discover what that true self really is -- and that's where the hard work comes in!

In addition to this film, supplementary films are included, each one dealing with a specific aspect of Jung's work. These illuminate Jung's concepts in new & often quite personal ways, so that we get an idea of Jung the man as well as Jung the historic figure. Further, we learn how exploring the psyche is as much about understanding the outside world as the inner one, and how each affects the other in ways we seldom realize.

Especially interesting to me were glimpses of Jung's fabled Red Book. What struck was how much his paintings of trees resembled those illustrations of trees drawn by Tolkien for his Ring series -- both share a similarity of form & organic flow. Fascinating to see two great masters of myth arriving at a similar vision!

For those desiring a view of both the world & themselves that goes far beyond the superficial, most highly recommended!",1327708800,11,1733,4.548076923076923
8306406,4,B001GOEY9M,"This video gives a very good ""sense"" of C.G. Jung and is based on a filmed interview with him. It is just as the title says, ""in his own words.""  It is excellent for anyone who has a serious interest in C.G. Jung or who is a serious student of Psychology. I will use it in the History of Psychology class that I teach for Psychology majors at the university where I work. The DVD is well made and includes interviews with other important followers of Jung. It is excellent historical footage.",1262390400,23,492,4.3478260869565215
