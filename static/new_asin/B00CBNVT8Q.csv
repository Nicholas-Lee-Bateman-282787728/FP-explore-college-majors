8579982,5,B00CBNVT8Q,"U.P. Wilson was a masterful guitarist, as can be heard on any of his CDs, but to really appreciate his talents, you have to have seen him in action (he died in 2004).  Until now, the only way that you could have done that was to have seen him in person.  Now JSP Records presents a DVD of him in performance in London in 1998.  It's a pretty lively set for sure, but you really get a look at Wilson's charisma and showmanship by watching.  If you're a U.P. Wilson fan, you really should have this.  If not, you probably will be after you watch it.",1423958400,2,547,4.122641509433962
8579983,1,B00CBNVT8Q,"This isn't the real sex pistols playing.
Don't buy unless you want to see a tribute band that sucks! Beware!",1386028800,,108,4.45
8579984,1,B00CBNVT8Q,"I was at this gig, to be honest is just somebody trying to cash in yet again.  Yes it does feature the Sex Pistols Experience, who are a fairy good tribute band.  The thing you won't know is that this night was badly spoilt by the singer having throat issues and not being able to hardly sing, if that's how you describe the Lydon esque vocals.

In all, don't buy it, you'll waste you're money! Trust me.",1234828800,3,404,4.220779220779221
