2488464,5,B000E41MTU,"Most fans of giallo films have an anticipation for each new film they discover with a overwhelming desire to see gorgeous european women being chased in colorful Italian backdrops to eventually find their demise by a black gloved killer. Usually the kills are extremely  creative, sometimes defying logic and the women end up exposed, in an artistic way while under the light of early 70's psychadelica.

With Black Belly of the Tarantula, you find something less than common with the films characters. Most films of this genre follow the triangular pattern of an innocent man caught in between the killer and the law but Black Belly does not follow that same typical story telling. Giancarlo Gianni plays a distraught inspector trying to solve the case of brutal murders, where the victims are paralyzed by a poison needle in the back of the neck and they eviscerated with a scalpel knife, but the inspector is reluctant to finish they case and has thoughts of resigning before the murders are solved.

Although this film came out relatively the same year as the great American crime film Dirty Harry by Don Segal, Black Belly shares the same theme of a frustrated but engaging inspector with distrust for the system and hatred for the criminals that he is always pursuing.

The conclusion of the film has its regular twist and red herrings applied but the ending scene has more emotional attatchment than most giallo films.",1266192000,,1425,4.9004149377593365
2488465,4,B000E41MTU,"""The Black Belly of the Tarantula"" is a superb giallo in the tradition of Dario Argento's ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage.""  Both are very similar in that someone is viciously knifing beautiful women to death.

  ""The Black Belly of the Tarantula"" was produced with a high budget and was well received throughout the world.  Everything about this movie is beautiful and extravagant:  the photography, the settings, and the actors/actresses themselves.  Three gorgeous women who starred in James Bond movies are in this giallo.  Barbara Bouchet, a giallo regular, is the first victim.  (She gave great performances in Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" and Emilio P. Miraglia's ""The Red Queen Kills 7 Times).  There is plenty of action and suspense in a plot that involves blackmail, drug smuggling, revenge, and creepy crawlers.

  Dressed all in black, the killer looks like a wasp as he injects wasp venom into his female victims.  As they lay on their beds paralyzed, the killer disembowels them while they watch helplessly.  The killer's motive is mundane but doesn't detract from the overall chilling effect of the film.  A great lounge score is provided by Ennio Morricone who provided the music for many Spaghetti Westerns and Italian gialli.

  ""The Black Belly of the Tarantula"" is a must see for all fans of Italian gialli and fans of the lead actors/actresses, such as Giancarlo Giannini, Barbara Bouchet, Claudine Auger, and Barbara Bach.  It is definitely a keeper in my collection.",1207180800,11,1504,5.086065573770492
2488466,3,B000E41MTU,"I like this kind of movie.  Just a step above MST3K fodder.  ""A very small step.""  Don't buy it if your looking for a movie like The Birds, but if you like movies a little on the campy side.  You might like this one.",1168300800,2,216,3.840909090909091
2488467,5,B000E41MTU,"La Tarantola dal Ventre Nero, to give it it's Italian name, is much more than just another piece of trashy European cinema.  It is an exquisite example of how wonderful cinema was in the late '60s / early '70s and an excellent reminder as to why I seldom bother going to movies these days.

Essentially, it's a whodunnit and we could debate the strength and weaknesses of the plot (and there are plenty of weaknesses) but the key to this film is it's cinematic style, a kind of garish Pop-Art vision of '70s Rome that mesmerises with each frame.  It's loaded with '60s accoutrements - retro-futuristic furniture, glamorous women's fashions, old-school Alfa Romeo's (was there ever a cooler vehicle?).  And the acting is stellar together with yet another legendary Morricone soundtrack.

As for the DVD itself, this is the first Blue Underground disk that I have bought and I can say without equivocation that it's the best looking picture that I've ever seen in this format.  Really vibrant colors that are a joy to watch even at moments when the plot begins to sag.  And full marks to BU for including the original Italian mono soundtrack with English subtitles.  In all, it's a great product that really captures how good DVD can be when someone takes care with these things. I will certainly be buying many more Blue Underground films in the future.

So, you get '70s Rome, funky decor, brash colors, a reasonable plot and if that ain't enough, there are not one, not two but THREE Bond girls in this film (and one of them gets nude and all).

No excuses for not owning this one.",1150588800,32,1582,4.658273381294964
2488468,4,B000E41MTU,"Someone's knocking off horny older chicks, and the fuzz are on the case.  Who the hell's doing it, and why??  The quote on the box claims this to be the best giallo ever made, but that's a pretty heavy statement.  Apparently the person who wrote that hasn't seen too many giallos.  Black Belly is a pretty cool film, but aside from the modus operandi of the killer, it's fairly average.  Plus, the identity of the killer was too easy to figure out considering they push a little too hard in making the killer look like the least likely to be the killer.  Once again Blue Underground has worked wonders on restoring this one, it looks pretty damn good.  It may not be the best the genre has to offer, but it's definitely required viewing for those into the genre.  Dig?",1147737600,5,768,4.435714285714286
2488469,2,B000E41MTU,"This 1971 offering stars Giancarlo Giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison-dipped needle before eviscerating them.

The production is above average slick and the performances are fine, especially from Giannini, but I just didn't find it involving, suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward.  It's not bad, just average.  The climax and the killer's unmasking is particularly weak and anti-climactic.

Fans of the genre seem to really like this one, but I suggest a rental before a purchase.",1144713600,6,598,5.071428571428571

2488471,4,B000E41MTU,"Massage and melodrama are brought to the fore when a compromising photo is sent to an unfaithful woman's husband.  Needless to say, he isn't pleased by the revelation.  Naturally, he becomes the prime suspect when she's found brutally murdered.  He vows to track down the stinker in the photo, and since he has the best half of the incriminating picture, he succeeds in getting to the culprit first, much to his everlasting regret.  Leading the investigation is a very reluctant inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) plagued with self doubts about his suitability as a police officer.  He's always a step or two behind the heinous crimes; he barely manages to figure it out during the last few moments of the film.

As mysteries go, it certainly keeps you guessing by concentrating on other possible suspects while completely ignoring the real culprit.  Shot with way too much style (at times it felt like they were taking inventory the way the camera moved so slowly over household goods and furnishings).  Was this a fashion statement or ""the best Giallo ever made?""  It had its moments.  It held my interest throughout.  I wouldn't mind watching it again someday.  I've seen worse.  I liked it.

2488472,5,B000E41MTU,If you like early Argento movies try this giallo  from another Italian director,1416182400,,79,5.076923076923077
2488473,2,B000E41MTU,"""Black Belly of the Tarantula"" is a completely average giallo, that Blue Underground have dressed up with some amazing hyperbole on their DVD sleeve, but the film really does not warrant it. It's a very standard police thriller, in which lovely ladies are being killed by an assassin who like to paralyse them first with insect venom, so they are alive and conscious while he slices them open with a knife.

Written down, that sounds like a pretty sick idea but the presentation of it on camera does not make the most of the concept at all - the girls are simply jabbed in the neck with a poisoned needle and then they collapse. The killer will then stab them in the midriff with his knife. A little bit of skill could have presented a much more nightmarish vision of the proceedings, but the director clearly didn't have imagination to pull it off. We only find out later that the girls were still conscious because an entomologist gives out a little biology lesson in wasp venom later on in the story - if it wasn't for that you'd be thinking that the victims simply died from being stabbed in the neck. It seems twisted to be discussing the fact that the murders are not depicted horrifically enough, but frankly (in these 1970's giallos), if they are not, then all you have left is a routine police and detective drama. Which is what we have here. The main character of the inspector is dreadfully wooden. The beautiful women around him (both victims and the inspector's wife) are vacuous and dull, and poor at acting in general. The English dub is atrocious (I know that's not the film's fault but it is really bad). The unveiling of the murderer's identity and the motive are both also very disappointing.

I've seen A LOT of Italian giallos now, especially from this era, and Black Belly of the Tarantula falls flat in comparison to the many others. There's no flair, no tension, and no characters you feel anything for. Of course the actresses are beautiful and the decor and fashions are pretty lurid (orange leather sofas!), but it takes more than that.",1395100800,3,2063,4.618528610354224
2488474,4,B000E41MTU,"As you can see on the product description page, a review on the DVD case proclaims this film to be the ""best giallo ever made."" Noting films like ""Deep Red"", and ""The Bird With The Crystal Plumage"", this is most certainly an overstatement of this films quality. That said, this film is a fine representation of why I consider the 1970's to be the golden age of international film.

While this film technically falls within the giallo genre, it has just as much in common with pop art thrillers such as ""Blow-up"", or ""Klute"". It is as good a visual representation of 1970's Rome as I have seen captured on film. The direction under Paolo Cavara is stunning, with masterful attention being given to each scene. There is a roof top chase scene which is especially notable, as well as a murder sequence that takes place within a mannequin shop. Its hard to get more giallo than that! Additionally, the score is masterful, with elements in the score mimicking sounds which the viewer is suspecting to hear within the action of the film. This adds greatly to the suspense of the film. Visually and sonically, this film is as good as it gets.

So, why only four stars? I'm afraid there are some minor plot flaws. Most notably, there is no believable motive ever revealed for the crimes. This may seem like nit picking, but when a film is billed as the greatest giallo ever made, nit picking is in order. None the less, this is still a wonderful film that I highly recommend.

2488475,5,B000E41MTU,"This classic giallo about a killer using a needle to paralyze his victims before slicing there stomachs open is very well made. It isn't as gross as it sounds; there's no extreme gore in the film. This is a very well crafted film that's well acted, and the directing is excellent. There's not much atmosphere in the film, but some of the scenery is good. As soon as the film begins, you get a Barabara Bouchet nude scene; and a little later on, you see her nude again with a flash of full frontal when she's dead on the bed. She's the best looking actress in the film, and fans of hers will like the rear nudity she displays in the beginning. It's a little disappointing that she doesn't have more screen time because she's killed early in the movie; this decision to get rid of her character so early on might not go well with a lot of fans. This giallo isn't overloaded with violence and the nudity is limited, but the violence that's shown manages to be effective because it's well filmed and directed; even though there's nothing extremely graphic or gory about it. In between the exploitation stuff, the movie entertains with excellent directing, some nice scenery, a well crafted story, and good acting. There's blood in the movie, but this isn't a body count slasher film. It isn't recommended if you're looking for something that's heavy on gore, violence, explicit nudity, and action. There's an emphasis placed on characters and story, as well as scenery. Fans of grindhouse exploitation will probably enjoy some of the scenes, but the film overall isn't very explicit; If you want something with lots of exploitation, action, and something that you don't have to pay attention to and is very low on talk, then you might want to get something else. I personally think the replay value is very good; I bought the DVD awhile ago, and I still watch it.

The interview on the DVD is good, and the DVD quality is excellent. It's best to watch the film in its original language with English subtitles.",1374624000,2,2005,4.632022471910112
2488476,3,B000E41MTU,"<strong>La Tarantola del Ventre Nero</strong> (Paolo Cavara, 1971)

In 1971, the underlying premise of this film (in English, <em>The Black Belly of the Tarantula</em>) must have seemed shocking in both its forms--the first, that a killer uses a paralytic poison to immobilize his victims while he kills them, and the second, that the story is narrated by someone under the influence of that poison, who is believed to be dead, lying on a slab in the morgue, waiting for an autopsy to be performed on him. Between then and now, however, we've learned that Marcello Danon's flight of fancy is far more science than fiction, thanks in no small part to the work of ethnobotanist Wade Davis (whose Masters thesis, <em>The Serpent and the Rainbow</em> was, shall we say, a bit sensationalized when turned into a wonderful Wes Craven flick). Since Davis' work went the eighties version of viral, the tetrodotoxin methodology in movies has become something of a staple, and the fear of being on the operating table while fully conscious has replaced the older trope of being buried alive in the pubilc consciousness. In other words, what may have seemed shocking in 1971 is now rather same-old-same-old. I rush to add, however, that none of this makes this particular movie any less worth watching; it's just that, with our new cultural eyes, none of what happens as regards either of those two plot mechanisms is likely to surprise you.

I've already given you all you need to know of plot above; a serial killer is going around doing his business with a twist: he uses acupuncture needles (again, this is something that must have seemed very exotic in 1971 that's second-nature now) to inject his victims with immobilizing wasp venom before killing them. Hapless police inspector Tellini (<em>Swept Away</em>'s Giancarlo Giannini in an early role) is on the case, and somehow entirely unaffected by the fact that he's surrounded by some of the world's great sex symbols (Stefania Sandrelli, Claudine Auger, Barbara Bach, Barbara Bouchet...). The case starts out looking like any other murder case, though with an admittedly kinky twist, but the closer he gets to figuring out what's going on, the weirder. Nothing, of course, is quite as it seems...

Cavara, probably still best known for directing the original <em>Mondo Cane</em>, lined up a wealth of talent for this one, and much of the reason it's worth watching comes from there. Like many gialli, <em>The Black Belly of the Tarantula</em> has a bog-standard plot, but the visuals are arresting, and the acting here is a cut above the usual; not the best giallo you'll ever see, but far from the worst. ***",1341532800,,2657,4.952914798206278
2488477,4,B000E41MTU,"I am fun of European horror movies and I must say this one was a very pleasant surprise. A typical yet good plot that will keep you hooked of this Italian Giallo. Descent acting that will surprise you to watch a very young Giancarlo Giannini, the actor who played a corrupted Inspector Renaldo Pazzi in ""Hannibal"". This time, he plays a good detective trying to stop a killer psycho. The movie has some female nudity that comes natural to the plot or scenes, so it does not uses ""sleaze"" to keep you hooked. Bloody scenes use nice close ups (Argento's style) and are quite well achieved for the time (1971). Overall then, highly recommended to those looking for Giallos or European thriller flicks from the 1970s.

Technically, a very good to excellent widescreen format DVD transfer. Audio comes in Italian and English; English subtitles are included. Extras include the trailer of the movie and an interview with Producer Marcello Danon.",1332892800,2,939,4.86875

Something indescribable that those films possessed seemed to be missing from this one.  The detective acted more tired & cranky  than obsessed.  A few murders happened quite obviously under his watch, plus  the violence was never that stylish.  The killer's actions were dispensed with and explained away a little abruptly in the end and there was no real connection that I could see b/w him and his victims.  Also, why paralyze your victim if you're not going to (I guess this shows what a sicko I am) ""play"" with them?  Why use the needle if the knife comes out seconds later?  Just not a very engaging story which as a result didn't allow the film to overcome its weaknesses, which are always present in '70s Eurotrash cinema.  And the scene where he busts the entomologist/drug smuggler was just ridiculous.  ""You're smuggling cocaine in disguised as sand for tarantulas to play in.  No customs official would search it.""

2488479,5,B000E41MTU,"I was in high school in the early seventies and had no idea what the Giallo genre was.  My first was Dario Argento's 'BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE' which I saw on the big screen and it made a great impression on me.  Television at the time didn't show any until the late seventies with Mario Bava's 'BLOOD & BLACK LACE' and Emilio Miraglias's 'THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE' which were few and far between.  'BLACK BELLY' was my second giallo seen on the big screen and it seemed to have vanished.  I spoke about it many times over the years but no one knew what I was talking about.  Blue Underground has released this wonderful example of the genre in all of its colorful glory and perfect widescreen ratio. The cast is outstanding with 3 gorgeous European actresses at the top of their form: Barbara Bouchet, Claudine Auger, and Barbara Bach.  It has a very young Giancarlo Giannini before Lina Wertmuller catapulted him to stardom.  The photography and music score fulfill the rest of the ingredients to make this release an important one for Euro Horror fans.  Purchase it and revel in a time when The Italian Horror film was truly surpassing every country in the thrills department.

In the US and the UK Black Belly and Dracula are adult films! I know for a fact that Fistful Of Dollars, Blood And Black Lace, and Murder By Decree are now only available in their shorter negative form, so what has happened to film democracy in these enlightened times? This Giallo stars Claudine Auger, Barbara Bouchet and Barbara Bach, actresses who have always been very careful to be in the right films, and they are very enjoyable here. The victims are onscreen and bloody and often sadistic, so with the top acting this is a very enjoyable Rome set Giallo with an appropriate score by Ennio Morricone. The female nudity is always tasteful, and it is a film which is difficult to fault with its modern Rome location.
