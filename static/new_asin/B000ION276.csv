2659536,5,B000ION276,"Samantha and the gang are back for more mystery fun in another good entry from this movie series created by Michael Sloan and starring pretty Kellie Martin. Samantha Kinsey (Martin) runs the Mystery Woman Book Store with help from her pal Philby (Clarence Williams III). Philby's mysterious past with the government always comes in handy when she goes snooping into murder, as does her friend Cassie (Nina Siemaszko) in the D.A.'s office.

Philby is broken up about the passing of his old friend and Samantha decides to let a folk group from the 1960's her mom loved kick off their comeback outside the Mystery Woman.  Before long both will be knee deep in mysteries which eventually intersect. The mystery, as usual, is a bit tame, but the fun is the continuing characters, who've become like old friends to fans. Philby might even have an admirer in the very pretty owner of the local Bed and Breakfast, Bonnie (Tina Lifford).

Some hi-tech bank robberies and some secrets from the past hold the clues to why someone was killed and, of course, Chief Connors (Casey Sander) is his usual lovable self, annoyed at Samantha's interference. Though Samantha initially butts heads with Connors, in the end he may not be far off the mark as to who commited the murder.

There is a really nice moment between Samantha and Philby at the end of this one, showing the special charm which always makes a visit with the gang as welcome and arresting as the wisteria covered trellace outside the Mystery Woman. Quaint fun for mystery lovers and Kellie Martin fans.",1179100800,14,1551,4.797752808988764
2659537,4,B000ION276,"Kellie Martin returns as Samantha Kinsey, the owner of the Mystery Woman Bookshop and part-time snoop.  The MYSTERY WOMAN series has a charming quality about it because the murders aren't heinous or particularly violent.  My wife appreciates that fact about them, and I get to play detective with her as we watch.

The pacing is both familiar and relaxed enough that we get to take turns pointing out clues (some we get, and some aren't clues at all but are our overactive imaginations) and put in our votes for who we think the killer is prior to the solution.  The cast of characters are likewise familiar, but they're well rounded and just deep enough that watching them work together is fun.

As owner of the bookstore, Sam seems to know everyone in town.  Philby (Clarence Williams III) has a mysterious background of his own.  Sam thinks he was once a spy, and everything in the series seems to indicate that as well.  He maintains a small office space inside the bookstore and keeps a clandestine group of friends.

In this mystery, a folk rock group from the 1970s called the Ramblers have reunited for a series of fund-raising concerts that will help fight world hunger.  They're managed by a young PR guy who ends up getting killed, setting the murder investigation into play.

Before the dust has settled on the murder, the band members are fighting among themselves, and Carly -- one of the members -- confesses to the murder.  However Carly has a long history of mental breakdowns and is soon ruled out -- at least for the moment -- as the murderer.

In the meantime, Philby is pursuing a case of his own.  Bank robbers have started hitting banks using cutting edge technology.  Even though he's retired from whatever it was that he used to do, he's brought in to consult.  Before long, Sam and Philby discover that all the cities that had bank robberies were also on the tour list of the Ramblers.  What's the connection?  And who committed the murder?

Granted, some of the writing and characterization is simple, but simple is what you need so you can work on figuring out whodunit.  I love watching the characters go through their familiar routines as they work out the puzzle.  The town, though I've never heard it named, seems like a great place to live (except for the periodic murders!) and I'd love to wander through the aisles of the Mystery Woman Bookshop.

If you want a quiet mystery filled with dialogue and a little action, a fiesty grown-up version of Nancy Drew, and without the romance element that can get in the way of the puzzle, the MYSTERY WOMAN DVD movies are great.  I've bought and watched all three that have been released so far and have enjoyed all of them.",1169510400,21,2699,4.635789473684211

2659568,4,B000ION276,"Kellie Martin shines in Mystery Woman series. This episode is a little dated, because there are no cell phones and you'll see a good old-fashioned darkroom for developing pictures.

2659581,4,B000ION276,"Bank robbers and folk music, what an odd combination.  Samantha Kinsey (Kellie Martin) is called upon to solve the murder of a shiftless promoter who gets cut off in midsentence.  The chief of police still hasn't a clue and is still arresting people willy-nilly (the man is professionally stupid, not to mention rude).  There's a missing kitchen knife, an inconvenient lawyer who shows up periodically to remind us he's just a plot device, and a man with one brown eye, one blue, gets mentioned a lot.  They've actually given the snotty cop more to do this time, which was not always a welcomed thing as he's a one-note creation that never goes beyond his limits as a grumpy cop.  Otherwise, a fun movie that doesn't strain the brain (less Nancy Drew, more Murder She Wrote).  A keeper.",1384992000,,786,4.700729927007299
2659582,3,B000ION276,"I LOVE Mystery Woman, and I wish I knew if there is some place to buy all in this series. This however is not one of my favorites, a washed up hippie band plans to have a charity concert outside the book store, but murder interferes with their plans. The lady singer in the band is SO irritating!! She does the part very well, maybe too well, crying all the way through the movie about how she ruined everyone's lives so that you want to slap her and say ""shut up and get a life""! She was unfaithful to her husband in the band with the other man in the band. This, with the added murder and some bank robberies makes for a messy situation, (not counting the awful music) and you hope the mystery crew clears this up fast. If, on the other hand you love ""folk music"", you just may love this helping of mystery, where at the very end even Philby (nnooo!) is humming along.",1378598400,,870,4.184523809523809

There are a bunch of other titles - where are they?  why would hallmark just release a few of them; it's been quite awhile since they showed them, so holding onto them so long just means more people who would buy them, will forget about them.",1318982400,7,353,4.086956521739131
2659588,5,B000ION276,"This series is just plain PHUN to watch . Enuff old fashioned thinking needed and plenty of differing characters involved that we grab the popkorn , and drinks , sit back and enjoy .
  No , theze aren't some ""cerebral wunders"" , but interesting to be sure . Kelly's lovlely face and Clarence's odd character are the perfect ""juxtaposition"" .
  the story pace is just about right . no ""action adventure"" , but ""i mite git kaught"" is common place , almost .
  I think these mysteries are unique in that all take place in one small town , are not blow out of proportion , believable , with characters more ""true to reality"" making one feel apart of the story .
  buy it , you'll lyke it",1309651200,,683,4.28125
