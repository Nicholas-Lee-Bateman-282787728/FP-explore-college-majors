THIS was what I had wanted, a history of the game, illustrated by video of many different machines in action, telling the story of these wonderful machines. It's a pity this doesn't seem to be available on DVD, but it is well worth getting if you can find a copy!",1383696000,,392,4.614285714285714
7880559,5,6304921284,"I've purchased several recent pinball documentaries and this old one on VHS is the best. It give you a detailed history of pinball from the 1700s to the early 90's. It goes into detail on various pinball mechanisms like the plunger, the jet bumpers and displays. There's even a few interview with pinball design luminaries which gives the otherwise mechanical-centric documentary, a nice human touch. For the price and the value, it deserves a spot on your shelf. Highly recommended!",1318291200,2,483,5.05
7880560,5,6304921284,"This video is a very informative and educational history of pinball.  It goes all the way back to how pinball got its name, the Bagatelle table, and all the way up to modern machines like Guns N Roses.  It also contains a  few interviews with celebrities.
Extrememly informative, educational, and  overall pleasurable!",959904000,8,318,5.0576923076923075
