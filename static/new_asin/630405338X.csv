The movie is so moving and touching, that you realize the wonders created by God and the perfect ecosystem that he has developed where everyone has a part to play. The narration by John Hurt is too good!

You will salute the creator and admire his great creations after watching this movie!!",1102809600,3,537,4.153846153846154
