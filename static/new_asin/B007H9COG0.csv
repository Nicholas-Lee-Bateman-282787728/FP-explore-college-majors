5085756,5,B007H9COG0,"I ordered this set used from goodwill_grand_rapids and I was a little nervous about it because DVDs aren't usually an item I would purchase used, but I'm on a budget and my husband loves The Simpson's. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it on my doorstep four days early! There were only very slight signs of wear, the dust jacket and inserts were present and all discs look relatively scratch-free. I haven't tried playing it yet, but if there is a problem when I do, I'll edit my review appropriately. Definitely ordering from them again!

5085758,5,B007H9COG0,Love the Simpsons. Season 3 is probably one of the best and very memorable. I would hope amazon gets more of the their seasons online.,1359244800,,134,4.4

5085761,4,B007H9COG0,"What can be said, by now you either hate The Simpsons or you love them.  This is the season they began to shine, and for the next several years they would continue to be the best thing on TV.  I still claim The Simpsons seasons 2-7 to be some of the best television ever.  Shame it is a sad shell of its former self. By the way, I bought this using Amazon's video service, it is inferior to other similar services.",1354924800,,414,4.08641975308642

5085763,5,B007H9COG0,"So thrilled Season 3 of the Simpsons is for sale, finally.  A very strong season.  My favorite is Flaming Moe.  Everything about it is typical of the brilliance of early Simpsons.  The scene where Homer confronts Moe about stealing his concoction is particularly well done.  It's poignant, funny, but also clever- the latter because as the two speak, customers are trying to hand over money to Moe for the drink, the money ""gets between"" Moe and Homer visually and metaphorically.  The cash register pops open, and Homer's face is obscured.  It's a quick scene, a few seconds, but it was part of the charm and cleverness of the Simpsons.  'Colonel Homer' and 'When Flanders Failed', both in Season 3, are also two of my all-time favorites.",1354665600,,739,4.809523809523809

All the other seasons have it and the case even has the slot where the booklet goes. I returned it and got a replacement and this one didn't have it either, I contacted customer service to see if this was a known issue so I could just accept it but they just told me if I got another replacement it probably wouldn't have the guide either. As a Simpson fanatic and collector, this will be an itchy thought in the back of my head, always knowing that I have an incomplete set.

5085880,5,B007H9COG0,"The first 10 seasons of ""The Simpsons"" may well be the funniest and most creative TV show in history. Season 3 has my favorite episode, the ""ringer"" softball team (I have watched it 50 times and i still laugh all the way thru it), and the entire season is one winner after another. But my main point is to address the issue of spending BIG BUCKS to upgrade to BD: frankly, I'm agin it. The image quality of these old dvd season packages is outstanding. I have a Sony BD player and watch on a very nice Asus monitor and the sharpness and color quality is excellent. Yes, they are ""full screen"" in the widescreen format, so there is some cropping (mostly on the bottom thankfully), and there is a bit of the ""squat"" effect particularly on the close-ups, but it's all marginal frankly, they obviously took care transferring to digital. So I highly recommend buying these early season packages even if you are a generally committed BD buyer. Some of these early seasons are PRICELESS in terms of entertainment value, and for real-world prices of $15-$20 worth every penny AND they will look great on your snappy widescreen too.",1399852800,7,1123,4.62
5085881,5,B007H9COG0,"This review is not based on the series, but on the new packaging of the DVD sets. I had all the original releases of seasons 1-12 on DVD. The original packaging was pretty bad, the internal DVD holders were cheap plastic ones, only held into place by glue, which, eventually, they would come loose. The new ones are made of a stronger plastic. It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,8,525,4.26

5085883,5,B007H9COG0,"""Homer at the Bat"" is my all time favorite Simpsons episode, but my husband had never seen it.  We were talking about it one night after seeing Ozzie Smith and I had to play this classic for him.  A quick search on Amazon and we were watching the episode on his Kindle Fire.  The download was fast and video quality was exceptional.  My only ""complaint"" is that the entire season 3 episode list comes up when you launch the episode with the option to buy the entire season, individual episodes, or play the episode purchased.  Come on Amazon, just play the episode I purchased.  If I want more, come back and buy more.",1394323200,,618,4.424778761061947
5085884,5,B007H9COG0,Arrived on time and was in good condition. The season wasn't as funny as I remember but it was still good.,1393459200,,106,4.095238095238095

5085886,5,B007H9COG0,"Any one who is a Michael Jackson fan will love this episode. I had heard so much about this episode from other fans that I definitely wanted to see it. It was so much fun to see it and hear it. First time of hearing Michael sing and speak as a cartoon character(other than himself in the Jackson 5 cartoon). The speaking is questionable. Some say it is Michael speaking in his bass voice, others say it is not. My take on it. It's a good chance that it was Michael speaking in his bass voice. Even though they named the person who did the talking at the at the end of the cartoon. People need to remember that Michael Jackson has a 3 1/2 (possibly 4)octave range in singing, so if that is true, he may also have that same range in speaking as well. Enjoy!!!!!!",1393372800,,760,4.1768707482993195
5085887,5,B007H9COG0,"If you're looking to concentrate on the period of The Simpsons where it was the funniest, this is the season where you would start. The second season did have some great moments as well, but this is year is really where the show hit its stride. Whereas the early episodes/seasons focused most of the attention on Bart, this season is when Homer and his legendary stupidity come to the forefront.",1392681600,6,395,4.6571428571428575
5085888,5,B007H9COG0,"Purchased this set as a gift for a Simpsons' fan. The recipient  was very happy with the quality. Fast shipping, too!",1392595200,,117,4.571428571428571
5085889,5,B007H9COG0,"A fantastic season of 24 episodes, each with fantastic extras. All have a commentary track by the creators and actors (from two to eight of them, depending on the episode), while others have some combination of storyboards (usually over 70 pages, often with red marker comments from Matt Groening, showing a lot of how the creative process flowed), an episode with ""pop-up bubbles"" appearing all over the place with factoids of information, and all sorts of other stuff.

This season features some classic episodes, such as the one about Homer inventing the Flaming Moe, Moe stealing the recipe, then both of them losing out on $500,000 (guest stars - Aerosmith!!!); ""Bart The Lover"", where Bart discovers Edna Krabapple's dating ad and fakes her out as Woodrow (guest star - a picture of Gordie Howe); ""Colonel Homer"", where Homer becomes the manager of a country singer, voiced by Beverley D'Angelo, and has a good ol' time; ""Black Widower"", where Marge's sister Selma marries Sideshow Bob, who is bent on revenge; and ""The Otto Show"", the only episode that focuses on Otto the bus driver, that would not have been any good if it didn't feature the always-brilliant Spinal Tap (although it seems that the guys who made the show didn't like Christopher Guest).

The extras are good - one has a promo spot that includes footage from ""Colonel Homer"" that never made it into the final show, and footage from a Macy's Day Parade of a Bart Simpson barge. Woo-hoo!!!",1391558400,,1461,4.863453815261044
5085890,5,B007H9COG0,"Many devoted Simpsons fans claim this is the one best season ever, if there has to be one best season ever.  I certainly think there is something sublime about the show at this stage.",1389312000,,183,4.382352941176471
5085891,5,B007H9COG0,"The Simpsons season 3 is claimed by some to be the most successful Simpsons season. This season won 6 Emmy Awards, an Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production, an Enviormental Media Award for Best Televison Episodic Comedy, and the People's Choice Award for Favorite Series Among Young People. Pretty impressive for a 24 episode season! This season also had quite a bit of special guest celebrities, musicians, and pro athletes ranging from Michael Jackson (used a alias which is kind of weird), Neil Patrick Harris, Jon Lovitz, Magic Johnson, Kelsey Grammer, Aerosmith, Sting, Danny DeVito and much more!

 Some memorable episodes in this season include ""Radio Bart"" Bart tricks the town that there is a boy stuck down a well with his new radio and when he tries to retrieve the radio so he wouldn't get caught, he himself ends up falling down the well. ""I Married Marge"" Another flashback episode when Marge thinks she might be pregnant again, leading to Marge and Homer to talk about their past pregnancies. ""Stark Raving Dad"" when Homer is thrown in the looney bin after wearing a pink shirt to work. He meets a man who claims to be Michael Jackson. ""Black Widower"" The first return of Many for Sideshow Bob (voiced by the amazing Kelsey Grammer) when Bob marries Bart's Aunt Selma and Bart is the only one that sees that he is trying to kill her. That is just 4 out of the many great episodes in this great season!

 The special features of course have the great commentary tracks + 4 hidden Easter egg commentaries! Also included is a jukebox feature with 11 songs, storyboards, more commercials with the Simpsons as spokepersons. Unseen promo and trivia tracks for ""Colonel Homer"" episode, and a clip of the 1991 Macy's Thanksgiving parade that features a balloon blimp of Bart. The Simpsons season 3 is a great season! Definitely a must own for any Simpsons fans!",1389225600,7,1882,4.799382716049383

5085903,4,B007H9COG0,"Technically speaking, this show gets 5 stars. It streams just fine.

Probably the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because some of the later seasons (like the next four) are just perfect. There are a couple of week episodes, but these are still way better than the current episodes of the Simpsons. Season 3 is great, it's just not one of the best.",1364515200,,355,4.461538461538462

Season three on the other hand is right where The Simpsons started hitting there classic stride.
