8225139,5,B000WPJSYW,"We bought this entire set and it is a great idea.  The teacher/host covers all aspects of what will be tested on the SAT Math section.  It includes comprehensive teaching in each area, problems and drills the student can do on their own, and detailed explanations of why an answer is right or wrong. The personal one-to-one approach of the host was very much like hiring a private tutor - students can go at their own pace and review as much as they want.  Well worth the money for anyone who wants or needs help getting a better SAT score.",1366070400,,540,4.38
8225140,3,B000WPJSYW,"The best thing about Eddie Cline's comedic misfire, PRIVATE SNUFFY SMITH is three Jimmie Dodd songs. The youthful future Head Mouseketeer demonstrates guitar mastery as he sings most pleasantly. ""Time's a-Wastin'"" was penned by vaudevillians Olsen & Johnson. Lyrics to ""The Yard Bird"" incorporate Snuffy Smithisms and references, while ""I Don't Know What To Do Blues"" is quite nice.

Cline was steeped in directing comedies, all the way back to silent era collaborations with Buster Keaton, and the actors involved were also skilled, so fault for an unhumorous script may lie in its creation by a committee of four.

The cinematic career of star Bud Duncan, who stood well-under 5 feet, began and ended in the funny pages. From 1911 on, he was Jeff in a series of silent Mutt & Jeff shorts. Duncan's last movies were two early-40s Snuffy Smith programmers. This one is totally undistinguished, dumb in fact.

I'M FROM ARKANSAS features another silent movie vet, the underfed and over-height Slim Summerville. Also here is Al St. John. An early association wth Mack Sennett may have helped bring St. John's uncle, Fatty Arbuckle to Sennett's Keystone Cops (Summerville was also a member of this bunch). In the sound era, St. John was western film sidekick to many stars, both 'A' and 'B' grade.

""Arkansas"" is short on laughs and very long on music. Performers include Jimmy Wakeley (""You Are My Sunshine"") and the Pied Pipers (""Stay Away From My Heart""). Some lesser-knowns do such classics as ""Pitchfork Polka,"" ""I Love to Yodel"" and ""Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy."" Oh, yah.

ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.
