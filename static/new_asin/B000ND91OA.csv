2764368,4,B000ND91OA,"Another great season of Home Improvement, definitely one of my all time favorite TV shows.  My only complaint is that the video on disc 2 is kind of funky.  It's feels like you're watching it in slow motion, or like every other frame was removed.  This problem occurs on about half of the episodes on this disc.  I think that the company is obligated to fix this problem and that everyone who has bought a copy is entitled to a replacement of disc 2.  I think that all fans should try calling technical support and mentioning this error and maybe even write the company about it.
I personally don't have any real problem with the packaging of the season.  I always prefer saving shelf space.  I also can't complain at all about the price that I got this season for.  It was on sale at Best Buy for $17.00!",1179360000,,805,4.355704697986577
2764369,4,B000ND91OA,"This is one of my favorite shows and the content is great.  But, the video quality on disc 2 leaves something to be desired.  Movement blurs and flickers.  The video on the other two discs is normal.  Disappointing.",1179360000,10,215,4.578947368421052
2764370,5,B000ND91OA,"It looks like they changed the packaging starting with this set. Instead of the cardboard folding box; holding the three disks with the matching slipcover. It's now a regular clear plastic DVD case. The first disk fits onto the inside front cover and the second and third disk fit onto the back cover respectively. Since the case plastic is clear; the notes and episode names are printed on the back of the label and can be seen once you remove all the disks. There is a cardboard sleeve that slides over the top of the case; that most people will probably throw away. To give you a better idea what this looks like. It looks just like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean; Dead Man's Chest"" set that Disney released a few month ago. (The same type of set up). I'm not complaining that much however; because the price for this and probably for the remaining seasons will be very low now. Season Seven is due out August 14th 2007; one more set after Season Seven and it's a wrap!! I'm looking forward to it!",1179273600,2,999,4.434782608695652
2764371,5,B000ND91OA,"I was SO excited to see that Season 6 is FINALLY coming out! Every season it gets funnier and funnier! Season 5 was my favorite, but I think season 6 will surpass it! That's a great price, I'm getting it right NOW!",1174348800,7,214,4.119047619047619

2764374,2,B000ND91OA,"Disc 2 has an extreme delay starting. Then you can only select per episode instead of play all. After you select an episode it takes 2-3 minutes to start, every episode.",1505779200,,169,4.483870967741935

2764382,3,B000ND91OA,I was hoping to be the exception but no such luck. Disc # 2 of the set does seem to have some issues. The video looks as though it's somewhat choppy as I did experience some issues with playback. There were two episodes that I was unable to watch due to the issue and at one point the DVD player stopped playback because it was unable to read the disc. I hate to add it to my collection but looking through all of the other reviews it seems as though it's an issue that is unavoidable.,1488326400,2,485,4.0625

2764406,5,B000ND91OA,I have always loved this show so when my wife found it on amazon we could not resist. This season was a good one but the comedy was kind of dry due to it being season 6 all the jokes were out played. but again i still  love the show and tim allen.

2764434,4,B000ND91OA,"Great season, still holds up well with the first five but the magic is starting to wear off and the cute adorableness has vanished. The failed wedding between Ilene and Al will leave you wondering why the last 4 seasons of watching them together, course Tim does an awesome job covering this blunder by having Al's mom faint thereby shaking the whole set as if an earthquake hit. humor as he says is a way of going through life's awkward and uncomfortable moments.  Seriously its like ABC and TV as a whole after Lois and Clark was so petrified of putting couples together that they did whatever they could for years to keep them separated. Even now they do this, Castle anyone? Back to point, this season is worth purchasing.",1439596800,2,726,4.584615384615384

2764488,4,B000ND91OA,"I own seasons one through six now. First off, I bought the sixth June of 2011, and all of the discs worked perfectly.
I find that the sixth season has a lot of quality humor, but it starts to feel a little forced in this season. I believe that's because they decided to make the show more dramatic, with AL's wedding, Brad and Randy's girlfriends, Jill's dad dying, Tim's Mom moving out of their old house, etc. Some of my favorites are when tool time is being sold to sweden with a Drew Carrey cameo, the ""routine"" episode showing Tim and Jill when they are extremely old, and the halloween episode. Another downside with this season is that Jill seems to be hoarse the whole time.",1310083200,,682,4.420634920634921
2764489,5,B000ND91OA,"This is one of my favorite shows to watch when it is on TV, so I figured why not watch it whenever I want to.

2764496,3,B000ND91OA,"I was very hesitant to order this set because of all the negative reviews on the quality of the disks but I wanted to complete the series so I bit the bullett and gave it a shot. I also felt a newer review was necessary as most of the ones written with quality issues were several years old. All 3 of my disks work fine but there is no doubt the picture quality of this season is well below that of the earlier seasons. Especially disk 2 but even disk 3 had some episodes that seemed grainy and of substandard copy. What's really annoying is that some episodes seem fine while others are just terrible. Another annoying thing is that they cut most of the bloopers from the ends of the shows, some of which are funnier than the actual show itself. There is a short (about 3-4 minutes worth) blooper selection on disk 3 from all epsiodes from this season, but I always enjoyed watching them immediately after the episode they were cut from, like the first 5 seasons. I am very disappointed as this is one of the funniest TV sitcoms of all time in my opinion. I still feel that the first 3 seasons were the best but each season had several good episodes and this one is no exception. I would really like to see a compilation of just bloopers from all 8 seasons but I doubt that will ever happen. If you can live with the crappy picture quality, or if you need it to complete the series then buy it, otherwise stick with seasons 1-5.",1237507200,2,1429,4.276752767527675

2764498,5,B000ND91OA,"cool family fun episodes. Tim Allen is great at it, and all the rest as well, from his wife to his kids, and his neighbour with the hidden face. You also always learn from each story a small lesson about life, and dealing with many sorts of situations, thanks to the neighbour with the secret face :)",1226966400,,300,4.280701754385965

Listen folks, if you have a problem about the discs, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I like this season, because it just gets better with age. Brad finally drives off on his own, but runs into somebody elses car, while Jill goes for her Masters degree. Great season for just about anyone, and if you have a problen with the DVDs, just complain it to the person, instead of sharing it with us, because that just makes it even harder for us to bear it.",1220659200,,555,4.196261682242991

Boy was I not disappointed. Tim Allen and the cast really come through with a lot of fun, unique episodes. This really was a great season.",1216684800,,365,4.069444444444445

2764503,1,B000ND91OA,"The Problem is that DVD 3 doesn't work. I already got the 2nd set, so it's not just a single failure of one set. I get the image that Buena Vista doesn't really care any more about the quality of the sets. You already recognized that because of the minor package quality.
It's sad cause the show is still the most hilarious show ever produced. Well, but it's just not entertaining if can't watch it! :-(",1193097600,4,403,4.315789473684211

2764506,2,B000ND91OA,"I like this show well enough, but I've never been obsessed with it to the point that I would notice the first time something was missing.  That said, I did notice some of these episodes seemed rather short.  Then I found this review at sitcomsonline:

Buena Vista had been doing a rather decent job of releasing this series on DVD, but then they decided to release the sixth season in a cheaper package than the previous releases. Of course, packaging shouldn't immediately cause alarm, but then you get inside the package and discover that nearly half of the episodes have this bizarre video compression problem. Then, on top of that, they use syndicated versions for an unknown number of episodes? Does everybody know what time it is? Time to ditch this set!

Okay, so that's why some of the episodes seem short...because they are short.",1184889600,7,839,4.76551724137931

2764508,4,B000ND91OA,"H.I. isn't my favorite show, but another one of those funny sitcoms that can tickle the funny bone.  My favorite part is Tim's jabs at Al's unseen supposedly overweight mother.  Hehehe snort snort  Anyway, I like the clear plastic packaging used for this season; looks cool.  I would've preferred the 2-disc per slim case arrangement, though (1 in 1 case, 2 in the other 1).  Would be nice if the episode list could be read on the back outside, not inside right side as I'd have to take out one or both discs if I need to see.  Video quality looks somewhat choppy in the opening sequence, but it's no big deal to me.  I know H.I. has been done on videotape, but it looks more like film to me in some episodes.  Season 6 was the first I ever bought for this series; found it at Target for only $17.99.  I might round out the entire series someday, but not in a hurry to do so.  If I do, I'll probably purchase the last 2 seasons before I get 1 thru 5.",1183334400,,950,4.14207650273224

Season six was only in my collection for about 24 hours, I returned it to the retailer for a full refund!
  ""The Complete sixth Season""??? I think Mr. Tim Allen himself would be disappointed to learn that more than a few scenes had been omitted from many episodes in the sixth boxed set. All of the episodes had scenes that had been re-edited. A few to the extent that they fade to black between dialog! It's like a stand-up comedian telling the wind-up of a joke, then walking off the stage before delivering the punch-line.",1183075200,13,608,4.5181818181818185

Other then a lot of wooden moralizing & a few stock jokes endlessly repeated, this shows offers NOTHING!  The lumbering nature of the comedy here NEVER produced so much as a chuckle for me.  I only watch prerecorded Media & never Broadcast or Cable.  I'd heard of Mr. Allen but had no idea what I was stepping in when I started to watch this set.  I suppose if you need something to watch with your 6 year olds & want to limit their exposure to reality this show would fill the bill; otherwise Forget It!

2764513,3,B000ND91OA,"I, too, have experienced the same problem with Disc 2 described by others.  The quality looks choppy.  If I had never seen the show before, I would have thought that it was filmed on low quality film, rather than videotape (which was used for Home Improvement for all eight seasons).

I also don't like the new packaging - as others have also mentioned.

But I discovered something else tonight.  I was watching ""I Was a teenage Taylor"" - the Halloween episode, on Disc 1.  There's an entire scene missing!  It's the scene where Larry (the ""Halloween Guy"") shows up at Tool Time and talks with Tim and Al.  That scene sets up the whole episode, and yet they've completely removed it from the DVD version!  My 12-year-old son noticed it immediately, and to verify it, we got out the VHS tape of the episode we recorded off of TV in syndication.  Sure enough.  The scene had been excised from the DVD version.  So far as I've seen, this is the only episode that isn't complete.

Too bad this 5-star show got such a 3-star DVD release.  Don't get me wrong: I'm glad to have it, and I plan on completing my Home Improvement DVD set when the final two seasons are released.  But I just find that my enthusiasm has been dampened because of these problems with the 6th season.",1179360000,19,1269,4.456521739130435

Mine is part of the The Complete Series collection in the tool box, however it is not even disc 2 that's the problem for me. That one works, rather it is the 1st disc. It literally freezes right on the logo on the boot up. I've tried multiple players and it refuses to play on any of them. The disc has no visible scratches. This complete lack of quality control is disgusting. Now I have a massive complete series box set with a bunch of episodes on a single disc that I cannot watch. Makes it not so ""complete"" anymore. Furthermore, as others have noted, on the discs that work, the video quality is also subpar. Looks pretty bad on my 60 inch Samsung 4K tv.
