7902672,4,B000003K64,"with a bunch of nodes,

add holodeck problems (including the captain and Data nearly being smushed by a train engine)

add a pinch of weird ship-wide happengs and you've got...Emergence.  On the whole, quite a funny episode.  You've got to enjoy seeing all the really, really different holodeck characters that pop up, especially the conducter.  Other good points are with Data handling traffic issues.  While the main plot was maybe be a little on the crazy side, I enjoyed it and appreciated the enviroment of the train with our 24th century heroes.",1157328000,,551,4.934782608695652
7902673,2,B000003K64,"Yeah, the visuals are stunning, the costuming is, forgive the pun, ""fitting"", but this has to be the dumbest ST: NG episode, next to ""The Royale"" and ""Devil's Due"".",1039305600,,164,4.689655172413793
7902674,5,B000003K64,"This was one of my favourite Star Trek episodes, from the teaser scene before the opening credits to the strange world created by the holodeck. I always liked the TNG episodes that were mysterious and dream-like. Since ""Emergence"" calls for the crew to interpret images in the episode it also calls to mind the first part of ""Birthright"" when Data started dreaming. Overall, this is a great episode, and one of last TNG episodes to air.",1018310400,,436,4.75
7902675,3,B000003K64,"I recieved this video as a Christmas present, and I thought it was one of the better ones I had seen. It involves a lot of mind twisting tricks. I suggest you buy it.",958694400,5,166,3.911764705882353
