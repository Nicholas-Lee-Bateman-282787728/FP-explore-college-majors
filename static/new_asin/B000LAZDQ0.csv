8426959,5,B000LAZDQ0,"I really like this DVD, since it is easy to follow and one can combine it with other tapes as well if a harder workout is needed.
I also have the one for the legs, which I grew to like. These are short exercises, but very effective if combined by weights, etc.",1183075200,,260,4.019230769230769
8426960,2,B000LAZDQ0,"The workout is very easy and... boring! I'ts divided in 2 section, the first one for abs, the second one for legs and buns. The exercises are not various and very specifical: crunches for your stomach, squat for your legs. You just have to repeat two/three exercises fos some minutes. When I bought it, I tought to find in this dvd a fun combination, or different exercises i didn't know. Nothing like that. It's certainly useful for a total beginner, but not for a person who was looking for a complete and various workout for abs and buns. It's quite... ""old""!
There is no possibility to chose different levels and workouts, and you have to combine this dvd to another workout to have some results...",1181952000,2,702,4.624
