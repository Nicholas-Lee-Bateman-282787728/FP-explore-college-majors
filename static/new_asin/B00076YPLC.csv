8323594,3,B00076YPLC,"This DVD Starts off ok but fails to deliver any real insights into ""advanced lead Guitar"".The sound quality is poor which is really unexpected with a instructional video backed by a famous learning company.
The other imediate letdown is the type of lead examples that are given. The lead examples are shown over Santanna style rhythem backing tracks,then followed by another bad choice of 14th century greensleves.
The one highlite is the acoustic blues solo section which is the most relevent piece on this dvd.
There are just too many other good DVDS on this subject out there,and this one fails to capture any of the new lead styles that people would be hoping to achieve.
Some may like this aproach in teaching style but others will most likely be a little mad that this was listed as an advanced lead technique dvd to begin with.
Look around first before making a choice on this DVD but if you have had others in his series and like his teaching style then buy it.",1194825600,4,969,4.606936416184971
