8607097,1,B00ENP3WK8,"I am new to verre eglomise and was very much looking forward to this video--particularly because it was taught by Frances Federer. However,just as I settled back to absorb her teachings, I was very surprised (kinda shocked actually) that the video ended exactly after 8 minutes and 33 seconds. Surely more could have been included here considering her scope of knowledge and experience. There were some very good basic tips, but I certainly do not feel it was worth my eagerness or the price.",1402272000,2,492,4.869047619047619
8607098,5,B00ENP3WK8,"A much anticipated book has finally become available: the recently published Gold Leaf, Paint and Glass by Frances Federer. Known by many throughout the gilding community as an authority on the ancient method of Verre glomis (reverse glass gilding and painting) we are taken through every step of the process in detail from cleaning the glass, creating a template, and marking up the design to preparing gelatin size, gilding & etching, and back-painting. Frances also discusses some of the history of this beautiful art and craft dating back to the early middle ages  while ending with an overview of problem solving and safety advice. Two thumbs up!",1387411200,,651,5.08411214953271
8607099,5,B00ENP3WK8,"I can't disagree more with the previous reviewer. This DVD, along with the accompanying book  ""Gold Leaf, Paint & Glass"" have actually become my bible for glass gilding and I refer to them again and again when embarking on any glass gilding projects.
My students have successfully completed the ""Mirror Project""  from the DVD, also illustrated in Chapter 6 of the book. They each own a copy of the DVD and have advised me that it was extremely informative and helped them understand the complicated process. Having the DVD, gave them the confidence to proceed with their own projects once they left my class as the DVD is chaptered and they can refer to a certain part of the process if they are unsure.  Some beautiful work was produced. This book and DVD are a breath of fresh air to anyone interested in the art of Verre Eglomise and I don't know of any other combination that covers the subject and materials required so thoroughly. I'm thrilled to have found them as are many of my peers!....they have saved me and my students from making many a costly mistake!",1382659200,2,1066,4.62962962962963
