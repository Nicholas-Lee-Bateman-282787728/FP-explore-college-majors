8748644,5,B01AVRZGZK,"Another awesome Bluray release for the third Gundam: The Origin episode! This one has an older Casval and Artesia splitting up and Casval's fate has him encounter Char Aznable! The journey through his Zeon Academy training begins!

This episode mainly follows Casval, now Char, in his quest to get a new name and infiltrate Zeon ranks and become the top student in competition with Garma Zabi. We get to see more of Amuro a little and Sayla's life as a medical student. Char's military knowledge really gets showcased here and of course the animation and voice-acting in Japanese and English are superb! You also get a bonus interview video only in Japanese with no subtitles and a booklet showing the concepts and art for the show. Overall another pricey region-free release but worth it for the hardcore fans and newcomers if they can afford it!",1470700800,2,847,4.841379310344828
