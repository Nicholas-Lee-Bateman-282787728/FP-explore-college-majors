7803254,3,6300148696,"I was looking forward particularly to the role played by Elsa Lanchester (famous for having played the 'Bride of Frankenstein', where she was terrific). Here was another 'spook' picture, where she could probably out-spook everybody.  I also expected some good pop music, since that was the main theme.  However, to my great disappointment, Elsa appears only near the very end, and, as an ill-defined character with no apparent role but to 'look' witch-like, which of course she did very well.  Nevertheless, she was in the billing as one of the key actors and had almost no role to play in it!  What a disappointment.  I don't know how this picture received a rating of 4 stars.  I would have given it 2.",1406592000,,704,4.729508196721311
7803255,3,6300148696,"I really like Robert Donat, the late and great actor, but this movie didn't live up to the (his) usual standard. The acting was good,  the movie cute, at best, but the story line shallow.",1399248000,,187,4.3428571428571425
7803256,5,6300148696,"I have loved this movie since I was a child, the lead actor is reminiscent of Errol Flynn (if you can remember him you are probably as old as me ;) )  The story line is hysterical..a couple buys a haunted castle and moves it block by block back to the US and of course the resident ghost goes with it. It is fun, romance and tears all rolled into one. Love it. If you don't have a VHS player try and find it in DVD format.",1398556800,,422,3.8505747126436782

7803258,3,6300148696,"Movie lovers/Scots-o-philles. Here is a pure 'cute' movie of the nadir of Scots history, when england all but bankrupted  Scotland. The acting is wooden, hyped, or sterotyped(even when it  was made.) But the Scots Highland attire they did get right, as well as a good sense of the 'mood of the 1600's'-""i.e. when the mortally ill father says: ""Nay, I no die till I see my sonne go to the batttle"".
  Watch it just for fun; & put away the 'criticks monocle'.",1366761600,,457,4.536585365853658
7803259,3,6300148696,"Alas!  If this old charmer has been on your ""once seen never forgotten' list, and you hope that remastering will bring it to you in improved quality, then you'll be disappointed.  I didn't expect anything could be done to improve the stagey, static camera work, but I had hoped for improvement in the sound track.  Ah, well, If you can get past these inadequacies, there is much to enjoy.  It has an engaging story-line with similarities to Oscar Wilde's ""The Canterville Ghost"".  Ren Clair, Alexander Korda and Mischa Spoliansky contribute in various ways, and  Robert Donat in kilts, sporrans, ghillies, cloaks and broached berets makes a credible Scot and an endearing, re-locating ghost.",1210896000,7,691,5.070796460176991
7803260,4,6300148696,"This old movie is most appropriate as it parallels the scenario of my nephew who has built two castles just north of Merritt at Nicola Lake. It is adjacent to the 'Gang Ranch' and is the site of the annual Merritt Music Festival.

Coincidently, his name is Donald and his grandfather was Murdoch. He has outfitted the castles with armour and antiquities and has also acquired the title of Baron of Rothy. A Scottish revival is in full swing with gatherings of the McLeods at intervals. I enjoyed the film in 1936 and still appreciate its spoof of the Scots.

7803261,5,6300148696,"Of all the great European directors who came to Hollywood in the thirties and forties, Ren&eacute; Clair may have enjoyed the most successful exile, directing the classics I MARRIED A WITCH and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.  But, before traveling from Paris over the Atlantic to the New World, Clair enjoyed a brief sojourn in Great Britain, where he made this marvelous and unjustly neglected comedy.
The plot is simple:  a land rich/cash poor Scotsman sells the family castle to a rich American millionaire, who has the castle moved to the US stone by stone.  The difficulty is that the castle is haunted, and the ghost moves with the castle to its new locale.  We therefore get a ghost fantasy with a different twist:  a ghost has to deal with culture shock.
For me, three things make this film stand out.  First, Robert Donat is marvelous as the ghost/impoverished seller.  Had Donat lived later in the 20th century, he would have been far, far more successful as an actor, and infinitely more active.  Donat suffered from nearly debilitating asthma condition that severely limited his screen appearances (as well as some serious stage fright, or, in this case, screen fright).  This performance is one of his finest.  Second, Eugene Pallette enjoys one of his greatest roles.  Pallette is perhaps best known as Friar Tuck in the Errol Flynn THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, and almost as well known in THE LADY EVE and MY MAN GODFREY.  He actually appeared in a vast number of films from the beginning of the silent era all the way to his death in 1946.  Yet, his major roles were relatively few.  I find his stern scowl, rotund physique, and softhearted core to be enchanting.  The third reason the film succeeds is the deft and light-hearted direction of Ren&eacute; Clair.  Partly because he suffered a sharp post-WW II decline, Clair is not as fondly remembered as he ought to be.  He directed the two Hollywood classic I mentioned above, but was even better in the early 1930s, directing in France such masterpieces as SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS and &Agrave; NOUS LA LIBERTE, as well as one of my all time favorite films, the utterly delightful musical LE MILLION.",1033776000,21,2164,4.758713136729223
7803262,4,6300148696,"This somewhat crude, frolicsome satire on America was written by the the great playwright Robert E. Sherwood and was directed by the esteemed Rene Clair: A rich American, played by basso-voiced Eugene Pallette, buys Glourie Castle in Scotland (complete with it's miserable ghostly inhabitant) and has it dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic to Sunnymeade, Florida where it's reconstructed complete with plumbing and electricity...The movie is very lucky in its star: Robert Donat brings elegance and his melancholy face and voice to the dual role of Donald Glourie and Murdoch Glourie, his phantom ancestor - and, intermittently, he redeems the action. Elsa Lanchester and Jean Parker are amusing in this mid-thirties frolic in which Americans were poked fun at. They took the barbs good-naturedly and loved the film; it was a very popular picture at the box-office.",1026432000,9,872,5.372262773722627
