4686683,5,B005FY1RQM,This DVD is a wonderful guide for professionals in the teaching field of classical ballet or serious students. It is nearly impossible to find a complete Vaganova method syllabus so I was really excited to find this. The DVD is put together very well and easy to follow. Included are the Level 3 steps for barre and centerwork plus pointe as well!! The steps are nicely executed. I was able to watch clips posted on youtube before purchasing. A teacher friend of mine had previously purchased the Character Dance DVD/CD set and loved it and recommended this one to me. I am glad she did!! I will soon be adding Level 4 to my library. Bravo!,1328659200,8,640,4.525862068965517
4686684,5,B005FY1RQM,"Wow! You will not find a better video for teaching and learning purposes! It offers the ENTIRE Level 3 Vaganova Syllabus which includes over 79 demonstrated steps in endedan, endehor, and entournant. Not many videos provide all three of these aspects. This video provides a large amount of focus on detail and precision that is missing in a lot of other videos as well as in many classrooms. The layout of the video is also very easy to use. I don't see how any one could be disappointed with the contents of this video. I would highly recommend this video to teachers, students, or any one who wants to increase their knowledge of proper pre-professional ballet training!!! I would also recommend checking out some of their other high quality products!!",1328486400,6,754,4.8076923076923075
4686685,3,B005FY1RQM,"It is disappointing. There is only a DEMONSTRATION of steps, well, they do write so on the cover (I wish it warned me). There is no explanations, no metodological instructions, no music.",1328486400,2,186,4.84375

8470845,3,B005FY1RQM,"The material and work is carefully done.  Though my DVD does not have any music.  Is music omission a DVD flaw or intentional.  As a teacher of ballet for 30 years - musicality is as important if not more than straight execution.

Not my favorite teacher's aid.",1398643200,4,261,4.48936170212766
8470846,5,B005FY1RQM,This DVD as the one for level 4 is an excellent teaching tool for any serious teacher of the method of classical dance. There are just a few minor spelling mistakes of some of the French terms but the content and demonstration of the moves very well presented. I highly recommend for any serious teacher.,1388620800,3,304,4.545454545454546

8470849,4,B005FY1RQM,It's great except I need to get hold of someone as there is a problem with part of the dvd--it skips.  Couldn't find anything on the dvd--so it must have happened in production.  Otherwise that which I was able to watch was great!,1361491200,,230,4.325581395348837
8470850,5,B005FY1RQM,"This DVD has all the vocabulary and proper techniques for the advanced ballet school. For everyone who takes ballet classes it is important to buy this DVD and have it at home always available for morning repetitions.  It is like having ABC book for the one who learns to read. Awesome! Thank you, Inna and Dmitriy.",1345939200,2,315,4.625
8470851,5,B005FY1RQM,"I feel very lucky that I found and bought a dvd with the Syllabus of Vaganova Ballet School!!!!!!

It is real a unique and absolutely helpful tool for those who already know some things about the classical exercise and about russian ballet method.

Very good quality of image, sound and clear presentation of movements.

Nice graphics in the menu.

Is a dictionary of movements without music accompaniment.

It is a unique and helpful tool !!!
