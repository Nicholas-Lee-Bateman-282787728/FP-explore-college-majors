2661507,4,B000ION73A,This and all the other Spongebob DVDs will never collect dust with my kids around.,1185235200,,82,4.533333333333333
2661508,5,B000ION73A,"My kids (Thomas, 7 and a half, and Saskia, 5 years) absolutely love it, as they love all Spongebob.  They take it out often to watch it over and over again.  And despite seeing them all before, I still get a laugh watching it with them!",1179964800,2,236,4.108695652173913
2661509,3,B000ION73A,"Just about everybody's commented on the unfairness of splitting the season into two boxed sets, the precommercials and the declining quality of the episodes.  All of those things are true.  And yet, it's still Spongebob -- in spite of the stinkers, there are classics like ""Driven to Tears.""  If you're on a budget, though, get Volume 1.",1178928000,,337,4.87719298245614
2661510,4,B000ION73A,"Although, these later episodes aren't as consistently good as the first three seasons, there are definitely some gems here.  What has become one of my favorites of all-time is ""Whale of a Birthday.""  I must have watched this one a dozen times already and I still want to watch it again!  Most episodes that feature that over-dramatic typical teen-ager Pearl are hilarious anyway, but this one cracks me up every time!  That song ""It's All About You"" is great and Squidward's ""I Need 4-Ply When I Cry"" is too much!  That one episode alone is worth getting this set, but there are other good ones as well.

""Chimps Ahoy"":  Sandy's underwater tree house has been funded by a group of educated chimps.  Having yet to develop an invention to justify her funding, Sandy's afraid she'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.  SB and Patrick try to save Sandy's job.

""Whale of a Birthday"":  It's Pearl's 16th birthday, and Mr. Krabs better not be cheap this time!

""Karate Island"":  SB wins a trip to a mysterious island to be crowned ""king of karate,"" but Sandy is skeptical.

""All That Glitters"":  SB's beloved spatula breaks while trying to flip a monster krabby patty.  While waiting for it to recover in the hospital (uh...yeah) SB sells literally the shirt off his back to buy a state-of-the-art ""Le Spatula.""  He soon regrets betraying his trusty ""Spat.""

""New Leaf"": Plankton decides to give up the formula-stealing business and open a knick-knack shop.  Mr. Krabs can't believe his nemesis has changed.

""Once Bitten"":  Gary the Snail starts uncharacteristically biting everyone in Bikini Bottom.  Patrick exacerbates things by spreading a rumor about Mad Snail Disease turning victims into zombies.  I like the part where SB jumps on a bus to escape the zombies only to be dropped off on the other side of the street.  Example of dull jokes that seem to show up more than in earlier episodes:  SB squeezes through the door of the Krusty Krab and then begs Mr. Krabs to let him in.

""Bummer Vacation"":  Mr. Krabs has to let SB go on vacation so he hires Patrick as an unpaid intern.  SB, at first, can't stay away and then he thinks it's a conspiracy. ""Wigstruck"":  SB finds a rock star's hideous, Mozart-on-steroids, wig and thinks it makes people happy but, in fact, they are making fun of him.  Silly episode, but good message I guess:  SB to Sandy: ""I got so much enjoyment out of the wig myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.""

""Squidtastic Voyage"": Sandy wants to try her ""Chamber of Shrinkage"" to shrink a submarine to retrieve a clarinet reed stuck in Squid's throat.  Patrick and SB accidentally start it.  As Sandy tells SB: ""This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boatmobile, which you've never successfully done, heh, heh.""

""That's No Lady"": A misunderstanding has Patrick believing he must leave town, so SB has him wear a disguise--as Patricia.  Has its amusing moments.

""Hocus Pocus"":  SB gets a magic kit and is afraid he's turned Squid into an ice cream cone.  Does a half-hearted Wizard of Oz take-off.

""The Thing"": ""Can't a hard-working squid get a little TV time alone.""  Not with you-know-who next door.  As Squid tries to get away from his annoying neighbors, he rides his bike into a cement truck and is encased in cement.  SB and Patrick mistake him for an endangered species.  This is a funny one.  I like when Squid is thrown in the zoo truck with the angry clam.

""Driven to Tears"":  SB has failed his driver's test 58 times.  He feels even worse when Patrick passes his first try.

""Rule of the Dumb"":  Patrick finds out he's descendant from kings and the royal treatment goes to his head.  Fun detail:  Patrick has a library book called ""How to Read.""

""Best Frenemies"":  A new kelp shake restaurant gives Plankton and Mr. Krabs a common enemy.

""Born to Be Wild"":  SB and Patrick prepare to defend Bikini Bottom from an soon-to-be-arriving biker gang.

""Squid Wood"":  After numerous playtime rejections, SB creates a puppet Squidward who is more talented and more popular than the real Squidward (well, that's not saying much).

""The Pink Purloiner"": SB suspects Patrick has stolen his prized jelly fishing net.

""Best Day Ever"":  All of SB's plans for his great day unravel.  This episode is predictable and a little much to take.  Since when can Squidward book a clarinet recital, anyway.

""The Gift of Gum"":  This is naaaaasty!  Patrick gives SB his collection of used chewing gum for Best Friend's Day and SB is not sure how to get rid of it without hurting Patrick's feelings.  Totally gross, man!",1171843200,22,4547,4.7375160051216385
2661511,4,B000ION73A,"There is so much hype going on with cartoons these days on television. Especially, with all of the most humorous and enjoyable cartoons from Nickelodeon today, it is just so much to enjoy for all ages to laugh along with. That is definitely the case with there main star Spongebob Squarepants. Since his debut 8 years ago, he has been one of the most enjoyable characters ever on television. There have been so many new episodes airing recently on the channel, it just shows how much people love the laughable antics of Bikini Bottom's sensation. Now, many great episodes are coming to DVD that haven't made it onto air before, and they deliver.

Spongebob Squarepants Season 4: Volume 2 consists of many great episodes, most of them which haven't yet aired on Nickelodeon on disc 2, from the second half of the fourth season. The shows are funny and enjoyable, and deliver fresh new laughs for die hard Spongebob fans. There are many great episodes here including That's No Lady, where Patrick disguises himself as a seductive woman, from fear of a hitman telling him to get out of town, Chimps Ahoy! in which Spongebob and Patrick try to make a incredible invention to keep Sandy at home in her treedome, but it has its backdrops, and Best Day Ever where Spongebob dreams of having a great day planned, but everything goes wrong and Spongebob has to fix it for his friends. There are also many episodes here that haven't yet debuted on the Nickelodeon network, which are making there debut on this DVD set, which also adds to even more of the joy to many faces including Squidwood, which Spongebob makes a dummy that looks like Squidwood, and people love and prefer the dummy over the real deal.

All in all, Spongebob Squarepants: Season 4 Volume 2 is a great buy for die hard Spongebob fans of all ages. I loved watching most of these shows when they premired on Nickelodeon, and I think these new episodes deliver just as well. It still goes to show that a cartoon character like Spongebob still is bringing laughter to all above the sea.

2661537,1,B000ION73A,"Ill admit it was delivered fast but that was pretty much the only good thing about it.
It said it was used and very good but when i received it, I would say it wasn't even near ""very good"".  The package was in okay condition but the dvds were both a little scratched and one was badly smudged.  I called the company for help in returning this product and the lady was very nice and apologized and gave me a refund.

2661538,4,B000ION73A,Spongebob Squarepants is the ONLY animated series that we can watch together as a family without feeling tortured.  We've purchased every season so far and we haven't yet been disappointed.,1263254400,,189,5.3

2661541,3,B000ION73A,"We are HUGE Spongebob fans, but have to say, this is not the best season. The writing is ""off"" and the subtlety is missing in a lot of these episodes. Seems like they changed Spongebob into more of a typical ""cartoon"" character--and his new high pitched voice with no modulation and depth of tone (as in the first two seasons) is just plain grating on the nerves.

I only bought vol. 2, since these are the least annoying episodes. The ones in vol. 1 are unbearable, so I didn't bother.",1213056000,,486,4.4
2661542,3,B000ION73A,"The epsiodes are much more childish, not as funny as the first three seasons, and many obvious opportunities for funny jokes were bypassed.

2661543,4,B000ION73A,"...at least 3 times a week, no joke!!

They live for Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff.

But I don't and can't blame them really; Spongebob is a catch and from time to time, the show itself is actually quite funny. It all takes place at Bikini Bottom, a town underwater, away from most sharks and beneath all the humans who dwell on earth. From time to time, Spongebob and Patrick make it a rare habit to come up out of the water, and take a looksee around. Immediately, they puff up like Mrs. Puff, Spongebob's driving teacher. He never learns how to drive successfully either. He's no good in that department, and should stick to the Krabby Patties!

Anyway, I'm gonna describe and then rate all of the characters and then rate a few aspects of the actual film:

Spongebob Squarepants: Very silly, upbeat and so nice to everyone that is nice to him. Even if you're mean, he tries to see the good in everyone. My second favorite character. A

Patrick Star: Super goofy and kinda spaced out, he's basically Spongebob's right-hand man. His personality, while goofy, consists of being nice to Spongebob but he tends to have an anger spout here and there. An OK character. B-

Squidward Tentacles: Another keeper, character-wise. He's the moody, selfish and very negative critic of the series. Many enjoy his company, especially Spongebob, but funnily, Squidward doesn't feel half the happiness when around the yellow sponge. He'd rather have his hands around his neck, doing the unthinkable. B+

Mr. Krabs: Very work-oriented, and a decent man who tries to instill the work ethic into Spongebob and Squidward also. Spongebob follows, and Squidward carries on, as if Mr. Krabs said NOTHING. Not one of my favorite characters. C-

Gary: My absolute favorite! I can't really pinpoint a true-blue personality to him, but he makes cat sounds, is usually quiet, which leads me to believe that he's an introvert as opposed to an extrovert, and loves Spongebob till the ends of the sandy ends of Bikini Bottom. A+

Pearl Krabs: The whiny, big-headed whale-daughter of Mr. Krabs. She's so ridiculously spoiled that I would slap her if I was an imaginary fish, residing in Bikini Bottom. She's not a bad character, and is usually super-dramatic. B+

Sandy: Level-headed and sweet, Sandy is nearly as friendly as Spongebob. Get on her bad side though, and she's unafraid to show you a piece of her mind! B

Mrs. Puff: She holds one of the absolute worst jobs in Bikini Bottom; trying to teach the unteachable Spongebob to drive! She goes crazy every time she spends 5 minutes with him, and for very, very good reason. A-
