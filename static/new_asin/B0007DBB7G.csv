Content is a little light on the tips and techniques but still, overall, this is a great introduction to kayak fishing.",1303344000,,272,4.25
8323611,2,B0007DBB7G,"The DVD was not what I expected. IMO, it was more of a ""highlight"" video of him catching bass. I thought it would show more kayak bass fishing techniques and other information related to kayak fishing. The DVD didn't even come in a nice DVD case. It seems like the DVD was just a ""boot-leged"" copy of some original. The production of the DVD was just average at best.",1247011200,,367,4.333333333333333
8323612,5,B0007DBB7G,"I hope you are in good health if you watch this DVD!  If you have any fishing background or just thinking about getting into the sport, this is a terrific place to learn some new things.  Ken has amazing footage actually catching and releasing some huge bass while fishing from a kayak.  You may have reservations about going out in a small, tippy craft.  See this video and it will change your mind.  Fun, adventure, and excitement is what fishing is all about and Ken serves it all up with plenty of good suggestions and advice regarding kayaks and bass fishing techniques.  If this show doesn't make your heart pound you have no pulse!  Also give his Flats Fishing DVD a try.  It has some great rigging ideas for your kayak and many other helpful hints.",1204156800,,756,4.507352941176471
8323613,5,B0007DBB7G,"I highly recommend this to anyone interested in kayak fishing, or even bass fishing in general, There are so many tips, observations and demonstrations in this dvd its incredible!  I learned more from your video than all the other videos combined.  Thank you for putting out a such a good learning video!",1197676800,,304,4.826923076923077
8323614,1,B0007DBB7G,I've not had sufficienly viewd the DVD as one month out it's shadow has not darkend my walk. So for a Christmas present it has thus far been a resounding DUD!!!,1169596800,,160,4.193548387096774
8323615,5,B0007DBB7G,"This is truely a great Bass Fishing dvd. There's no background music to dance to. Just the sounds of Spring Peepers,Frogs & Ken's excitement when hooking a Bass in Florida's Ocala National Forest's remote ponds & Lake George. This is shallow water Bass fishing at it's finest. Ken shows you how to ""stalk"" bass,not just fish for them. He even toys a moment with an alligator or 2 and yes it's true,you actually feel like you're riding on the back of the kayak fishing with him. Watch in slow motion as the Bass jump while Ken fights them. I haven't counted the Bass he catches on this flick but it must be atleast 30,with many on the first cast. You'll learn some neat tricks for catching Bass on your home waters even if you don't own a kayak.this isn't a dvd you'll watch once and shelve it. I've watched it 6 times in a few days and will watch it many times again. This one will really get you fired up to go fishing. Great job Ken.",1140998400,,935,4.288135593220339
8323616,5,B0007DBB7G,"This dvd was very exciting and entertaining to watch. The action was non stop and the camera angle gives you the feeling you are on the water with Capt. Ken!

Capt. Ken shows you how to rig both artifical and live bait and gives plenty of tips on fighting the silver monsters!! you will lose your breath when a very large shark almost climbs into the kayak with Capt. Ken!!!! All in all a great dvd and cant wait for more productions!",1137801600,,434,4.2926829268292686
8323617,3,B0007DBB7G,Great tactics for  the beginning  fishing kayaker.  Very good video and I can't wait  for the Flats Fishing dvd to come out. Ken's web site is also good.,1124409600,,153,4.357142857142857
