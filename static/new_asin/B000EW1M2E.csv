8114747,5,B000EW1M2E,Great for any young child. It's a hit with all my children and teaches God's word with humor and fun too. Very entertaining and biblical.,1356652800,,137,4.52
8114748,5,B000EW1M2E,We love GodRocks and this DVD is great!  Kids love it and have fun with it.  Parents love it because kids are singing bible verses!  Highly recommend!,1351555200,,150,4.481481481481482
8114749,5,B000EW1M2E,"This is a great series!  We buy these for our 4 year old daughter who within a day or so will be singing the songs and quoting the verses, even more amazing is she understands the basic concept of the verses as well!",1320710400,,216,4.023255813953488
8114750,5,B000EW1M2E,"This is a wonderful dvd and very well done.  The segments of cartoons mixed in with the story are very entertaining and most importantly teach a lesson along with the scripture verse that is put to music. The kids particularly loved the surf episode "" Kamooka= Mooka Surf Party"" based on 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. I show these dvds to children ages 3-11. The production is well crafted and holds the children's attention.",1259280000,,417,4.791666666666667
8114751,5,B000EW1M2E,"These two episodes help kids know what it is like to Grow in the Lord.  I think adults can really learn from this DVD as well.  I enjoyed all the music and the cartoons, they are fun and humorous.  I would recommend it to everyone and especially to those who want an easy way to learn some Bible passages.",1237507200,,305,4.135593220338983
8114752,5,B000EW1M2E,"The characters are fun, messages are terrific and the music is good too! Good clean fun.",1221004800,2,88,4.5625
8114753,4,B000EW1M2E,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this DVD, but I wanted a way for my kids to learn scripture easily, so I gave them a shot.  My 5 year old and 7 year old liked them immediately.  I also found that my 2 year old has also learned some of the songs, and I did as well just from overhearing them.  Sometimes the stories can be a little cheesy, but overall I appreciated them and the kids were engaged and learned the songs.  There are two episodes centered around different passages of scripture on here, then there is the option to just watch all the ""music videos"" each with a different scripture passage.
Thumbs up!
P.S. I love these newer flash animated ones, but not the earlier ones that were done with computer animation.  The computer animation looks clunky and poorly done.  There are plenty of later traditionally animated DVDS in the series, though.",1213660800,2,860,4.445859872611465
