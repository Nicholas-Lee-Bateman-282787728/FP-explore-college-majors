8412347,5,B0040IE2IY,"This movie is a classic which illustrates the adage about wars being 99% boredom and 1 % stark terror. There is a lot more stoicism than heroism in this tale of a Royal Navy officer who was involuntarily retired in the inter-war period for hazarding his ship but who is brought back into uniform in World War II. His ill luck continues as he is assigned to a World War I four stack destroyer that was supplied under Lend-Lease because the US Navy wanted to get rid of it. This was the gift horse of the proverb. Well played by Trevor Howard the retread captain's luck never gets much better. It is war against the elements as much as against the Germans. They ram sunken wrecks, British pubs, and finally a U-Boat. The weary warship is then sent on a one-way mission from which the crew might have returned, but never the expendable gift horse.",1486857600,,844,4.451612903225806
