8353919,4,B00274RFMS,I[ll have to see this one again; it ends so abruptly.  There are some cliche's like the exploding car when the driver inserts the key.  The lead female is perhaps the nastiest of the cast...I loved Pizzicata by the same director and that's why I bought this one.  It is filmed in Salento where I have a house and its towns are very typical of Puglia.  There's no effort to pretty up the place which is actually more beautiful than shown; no hint of the many magnificent beaches on the Adriatic and Tyrhennian seas.,1475884800,,514,4.4361702127659575
