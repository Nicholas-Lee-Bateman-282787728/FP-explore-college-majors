7799444,4,1584481730,"OK, so this is not good IMAX fare. That should probably be confined to mountains and wildlife. What the Chinese did was to make a pretty normal Chinese historical epic. There are tremendous sets, and armies numbering in the thousands. Colorful costumes. Tough-looking warriors and beautiful women. And lots of fighting. If you like that as I do, then you know already what this is and you will think it's fine. If Chinese movies hold no appeal for you and you don't care about Chinese history, it isn't fine. It is essentially a lavish documentary about the ""First Emperor of China"", and that concept will either grab you or it won't.",1028160000,,634,4.7207207207207205
