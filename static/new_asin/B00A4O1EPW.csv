8546718,5,B00A4O1EPW,"InstruMENTAL Inspirations: Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, Tony MacAlpine...

This DVD was simply awesome I really like the inter action of the band. They the band make you feel as if you are apart of their world. a real rarity these days. Billy's bass playing is over the top. Tony's guitar playing is a real treat. mike's progressive drumming is nothing short of amazing. I wish it could have been a longer live show but nun the less a highly recommended.  -  RG",1386720000,,461,4.597560975609756
8546719,1,B00A4O1EPW,"There's not a lot of inspiring dialogue here, just guys shredding on their instruments. Camera work is good. Audio is good. But I was hoping for artistic insights from each guy. Nope.

About the best thing said was by Billy Sheehan. ""Come prepared. Do your shedding so that when it comes time to play together you're not suffering through the difficult parts, but enjoying them.""",1378425600,2,379,4.8307692307692305

8546721,5,B00A4O1EPW,"I consider it a must for every musician (aspiring to working). The combined amount of experience this guys have to offer alone is worth it. Plus the selection of songs they cover is healthy too. So if you're not a musician, skip the interviews part, and you have a very entertaining set of instrumentals. I don't have anything negative to say about it. Although one can say that it is fusion/prog music, I think that the lesson we have here has an universal appeal. Anybody who plays in a band (or wants to) has some vital things to learn here. Thanks PSMS!",1372723200,,557,4.470588235294118
8546722,5,B00A4O1EPW,"The best formula for years, musical and sound quality is paramount, dvd format is simple without stop needless expenses, the box is plastic and DVD nothing else, it looks simple but the important thing is to play, you just keep your mouth open, presents more music and interviews, music has a complexity and quality at the top!!!!! fantastic to listen and play music as inspired bass, keyboards, guitar or drums. Thank's for this wonderful job!.",1365206400,,445,4.946666666666666
8546723,5,B00A4O1EPW,"I heard of this lineup by chance, and found this DVD on Amazon. What a find!!

These are four extraordinarily accomplished musicians, masters at their trade; on close-up, both with their playing, and sharing nuggets of their wisdom from experience gained at their craft, and musical influences. This is mostly fusion jazz and rock, at its best.",1364860800,,344,5.035087719298246
8546724,5,B00A4O1EPW,"I think this DVD is very good. I love Mike Portnoy's drumming. He is the reason i purchased this. It has made me interested in the SMS portion of the band, who now i follow on Twitter or Facebook. Just all great musicians! He just gets better with age (as we are the same age), I'm not a musician but i've always been a fan of music, especially rock, hard rock, prog rock, metal, prog metal. This DVD is awesome, i like the way the guys talk about the song and what influenced them to play it. I like that its not in a live venue(even though i would have bought that too!). I would love to see these guys perform live. Definitely something to add your library. Buy it! Worth every penny!",1359244800,,687,4.172932330827067
8546725,4,B00A4O1EPW,"I know this DVD was put out by DrumChannel.com, but all 4 guys get equal time -- it's not all centered on Portnoy.
Sheehan, MacAlpine, and Portnoy are just great -- and nothing too over the top.
I'm not too big of a Sherinian fan, but I think in this setting, he works out quite well.
And the selection of songs is quite diverse -- a very good mix.
The interviews with each artists are also great, especially for folks unfamiliar with each artist's background.",1358553600,3,460,4.423529411764706
8546726,5,B00A4O1EPW,"Recieved my copy of this fantastic studio project with some of the top music artists (in my book). I wish to thank you all who worked on this. I particularly want to thank you for the emotion I felt during the interview segments, I have been busy with life and you reaquainted me with names I hadn't heard or thought of for many years. Cobham, Corea, Yan Hammer to name a few.

 Have been revisiting my musical roots of late and it's had a profound impact on my frame of mind. I suppose if you don't get it the first time, than take a deeper look and don't just listen, but hear the expression, commitment and love these guy's have for there craft. All music is good but some is better than others...this a great example of that.

Buy this video and see for yourself, you'll thank them too.",1354752000,4,790,4.2885906040268456
