2883715,5,B000S8CLR4,"The Soprano's have nothing on The Black Donnelly's.  This is by far the smartest and most fast paced show.  Watch 5 minutes of any episode and I promise you will be hooked.  FAMILY ABOVE ALL ELSE.  There is nothing like it on television.  Better than 24.  Check out [...].  I guarantee once you watch, you'll be a firecracker too!!!",1182816000,,332,4.52542372881356
2883716,5,B000S8CLR4,"there's only 2 shows that i could tolerate watching on network tv - house md and the black donnellys.  now it's only house ... just because nbc took tbd off the air.  i still can't figure out why.  maybe it wasn't as easy to make as the reality show that replaced it (the real wedding crashers).  who knows why they took it off the air, it's still one of the best shows in recent years.  i'm just hoping that hbo or someone picks it up so we can get a second season.  i don't subscribe to hbo, but i love this show so much ... i'd be willing to get it!",1182729600,9,552,3.9279279279279278
2883717,5,B000S8CLR4,This was one of the few quality shows on cable.  In fact it is the only one I thought worth watching in a long long time.  I really enjoyed its unique story line and quality picture.  It's very sad that it was cancelled so prematurely.  Hopefully it can come back a little more hardcore on HBO or something.,1182729600,9,307,4.241379310344827
2883718,5,B000S8CLR4,The Black Donnellys is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I was so sad to see that it was cancelled before it was given any time to really gain an audience. I am so excited to have acopy of my own. This show really was something special. The acting was phenomonal. Each actor really grasped their character and played them very well. I cannot wait until I recieve my copy! This truly will be money well spent!,1182729600,9,422,4.158536585365853

2883720,5,B000S8CLR4,"When the pilot episode had aired, we were first engaged with a peculiar character named Joey ""Ice Cream"", who would later become the narrator for the rest of the story. He introduced us all to four Irish brothers, Jimmy, Tommy, Kevin and Sean Donnelly, who lived in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. Irish blood clashed with Italian blood.. and keeping the peace was quitely understood until one day. The Donnellys made a mistake by disrupting the peace and what was unknown to them.

As viewers, we were catapulted into a world of family hardships, corruption and misdoings. More characters were introduced, names that have become synonymous of characters in our own lives in one shape or form including: sweet Jenny and her father Mr. Reilly; Dokey Farrell, the brute and Irish bully; Nicky Cottero, the Italian rat; and the widowed Mrs. Donnelly, who only wanted to see her boys survive in a life of adversity. Throughout the season, we see the emotions erupt, motives unravel and suspicions revisited.

After viewing the second to last episode, we understand with clarity the core of the Donnelly family. Sean, the youngest, is clean of any misdoings and his brothers make sure that is how he stays.. innocent. Kevin acts as comic relief while being able to support his brothers both emotionally and physically. Jimmy is the oldest child, rough along the edges. He holds the family pride but is challenged with humility. Tommy is the strength of the family. He only does what he thinks will undo what is ""wrong"".. and realizes a world of manipulation and negotiation can only get you ""right"" for a period of time.

As the season drew to a close.. the second to last episode entitled ""The Black Drop"", was a rough and intense episode. With each episode we see the story escalate and the emotions heighten. With the final episode.. ""Easy is the Way"", The Black Donnellys will leave a lasting impression in your minds and your hearts.",1182643200,16,1930,4.824773413897281
2883721,5,B000S8CLR4,"This is an amazing show!  NBC took this show off the air after 5 episodes and offered it online only.  TBD didn't have a chance to succeed.  However, Mark Cuban saw the potential in this show and he is now airing the first season on HDnet.

This story follows four brothers who begin to fall into a life they never would have dreamed of being involved in.  If you liked The Godfather and/or The Sopranos, you will love TBD as it is a similiar cross between the two.",1182556800,9,465,4.238636363636363
2883722,5,B000S8CLR4,"""The Black Donnellys"" follows the story of four young Donnelly brothers -- Catholic Irish-American siblings in New York's infamous Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. The story is told by an unreliable narrator and Donnelly childhood friend named Joey 'Ice Cream' while being incarcerated. The series stars Jonathan Tucker, Thomas Guiry, Olivia Wilde, Billy Lush, Michael Stahl-David, Kirk Acevedo and Keith Nobbs. It was co-created by Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco (best known for the movie ""Crash"").

The series debuted on NBC on February 26, 2007 and took the place of the troubled ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" on Monday nights. The series' initial half hour did well (10 million) but viewership fell off significantly in the second half hour (6 million). It never got any better.

NBC aired seven episodes but, with most of the rest of the network's schedule performing poorly, they had to drop it. They streamed the rest of the series online.

It's a real shame because ""Donnellys"" had some solid performances and interesting characters. If NBC had been doing better, they probably would have stuck with it and perhaps even renewed it for a second year.",1182556800,111,1154,5.095238095238095
2883723,5,B000S8CLR4,"Every now and again a series comes along that plays for one season and drops off the map.  The Black Donnellys is one such series.  Four brothers lead by Tommy as the neighborhood ""good guys"".  Want something done?  See Tommy.  Need a cruel husband beat up?  Get Jimmy.  Wanna place a bet?  There's Kevin.  Need a lift?  Sean's got a car.

There's a lot if great character development here.  In fact, the writers did so well there's even one if the brothers you'd like to see less of.  Watch it.  You'll figure out which one.  This could have gone somewhere.  Maybe one day NBC, or better yet Netflix, will pick up where they left off.  There's an awful lot of unfinished business, if you ask me.",1471910400,,696,4.396825396825397
2883724,5,B000S8CLR4,I caught this one season series the other night(8/7/16) on Netflix. I enjoyed it so much I bought a copy on Amazon. The series takes place in the Hell's Kitchen of Manhattan. Being Irish American I didn't know much about the Irish mob until I read a book about Whitey Bulger. Since then I have read a couple of great books on the Irish mob written by T.J.English. This series is a must have for the mob section of everyones movie library. I also recommend the Sean Penn movie State Of Grace. Its a movie about the Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen.,1470787200,,542,4.323529411764706

2883728,1,B000S8CLR4,"Can kinda see why it didn't last for more than a  season. Every good writer knows that you should never be so ambitious as to make 14 episodes for a pilot season. Anyways, the dialogue and editing was effing obnoxious as well as the narrators' voice. It's almost as if they were trying TOO hard to be an amalgamation of Pulp Fiction, The Departed,  Sons of Anarchy, and an Irish Sopranos. The best acting was James Badge Dale, and Olivia Wildes character really annoyed the piss out of me- chasing after Johnathan Tucker who wanted to be in like of her but was just *in dramatic soap opera voice* ""so busy caught in between feelings!"" Lots of swearing, drinking and 'WE ARE IRISH!' The plot was always unclear and I hated that any Italian they ran across just happened to be named Sal or Micky. I guess every show is meant for a certain demo but normally I like shows about different cultures. I don't know, something just tells me that this show was rushed. I'm super happy it got cancelled. Though JT was supposed to be the star, I'm beginning to wonder if The Black Donnelys is the reason I haven't seen him in much else.",1467244800,,1124,4.42512077294686

2883737,5,B000S8CLR4,"A great, short lived series with top notch acting and writing. I won't bother to mention what everyone else has already said. All of the actors were positively brilliant and this show could easily have lasted for 6 or 7 seasons but it barely lasted one. In fact, I think only 3 or four episodes aired so we get to see how the series ended. As someone else said, we have a lot of junk on tv but this was one classy tv series. If only NBC had realized the mistake they made by cancelling The Black Donnelly's. The last episode ties up the series nicely but it also leaves you with small hunger pangs. If only the series had continued, right?",1446595200,2,639,4.245901639344262
2883738,5,B000S8CLR4,Good show .Bit of a nail biter. The story line was good as was the actors & the acting. Recommend to buy.,1445299200,,105,3.8181818181818183
2883739,2,B000S8CLR4,"NBC's answer to the Sopranos, was a show called The Black Donnellys, and it was a show about the Irish mob, starring Jonathan Tucker, who is as talented as he is good looking, so what went wrong? As it turns out, there were a lot of things wrong with this show that could have been easily corrected. We forget though that this is the era of on-demand, DVR, and Netflix, and in today's world, network shows that don't crack the top 50 in their first 13 episodes, don't stand a chance.

The Donnelly brothers grew up in a tough Boston neighborhood, and their father, was heavily involved in the Irish mob. Wanting a better life, Mr. Donnelly's four sons inherited his bar and try to run a legitimate business. There is of course a problem, not all the Donnelly's are keeping their noses clean. Eventually, a pair of brothers run into problems with the Italians, and have to learn the lessons their father never wanted them to learn. The show has a very solid backstory and if it were presented in the correct way, I think it could have been a huge hit, but as it turns out, the show was like a bad joke, which only a handful of viewers seemed to get.

For starters, the show is narrated by a wise-cracking family friend who is always telling the story in some comedic way to one law enforcement agency or another. The big joke is how does this guy know all these things when he's not there, and then, just like that, he's randomly there in the background, with everyone looking confused.

The timing of the story is also problematic, because when you're doing a show like this, you need to draw viewers in before starting the story from the very beginning. Would anyone have watched the Sopranos if Tony Soprano was a twenty year old kid, just getting started? If this show had started a few years later, when the brothers were established gangsters, in some full on mafia war, and then gone back and showed how it all started, it would have been a lot more interesting. As I watched the episodes, I could see the show leading into something bigger and better, but it never go there. I suspect there were big plans for future seasons, but how can you start a show assuming there will be more seasons?

As for the brothers, they are all former child stars, led by Jonathan Tucker. While he's not a huge star in Hollywood, he has made it a lot further than his co-stars, and his experience and talent are very evident, especially by comparison. Tucker has what it takes to take the lead in a show like this and draw in an audience, but that's impossible when the show is poorly written and just doesn't seem to go anywhere.

The bottom line, I like the idea behind the show and there were a couple of really interesting characters. If this show had lasted, I have no doubt that it would have grown into something bigger and better, but as it stands, The Black Donnellys didn't make past it's first season, and with good cause. I kept waiting for things to happen that never did and eventually gave up on it too. Having an idea for a long running series usually means that show will be well written and highly intelligent, but in today's world, if you want to go beyond one season,  then you really need to go all out, right from the beginning, if not, you'll be a forgotten show on Netflix, that some talented reviewer finally sees eight years after the fact.",1445126400,,3355,4.438311688311688

I think it was just too much for the time it was being aired.  It does deserve a 5 star rating for scripts, actors, and story lines.  I don't think it will ever be reprised.

A show way ahead of its time, and unfortunately became a victim of someone working at a network too quick on the trigger to cancel the series.  Add this to the present-day line-up on FX or AMC and it would be a completely different story. I'd love to see this series get a second chance, but that's extremely unlikely.  While I would have liked to have seen more closure to the story in the final episode, it's still a series I would not have wanted to miss a minute of any episode.

Why would I get emotionally invested in a show that's going to get yanked after half a season? If a show as phenomenal as The Black Donnellys can't get a fair shake at The Peacock, then the network is hopeless. Just show Matt Lauer juggling for an hour and switch to the local news. You're done.

As for the show - the plot is tightly written, open, explosive, gritty. The acting and directing is just as good. I highly recommend you check this show out, even though you will ultimately be disappointed at the conclusion. It's clearly rushed and never gives you the closure you deserve after feeling for these characters.

2883792,5,B000S8CLR4,"Let me start by saying I don't write reviews often...
I remember hearing about this show when it was on but was a little younger back then so I figured it wasn't for me.  Then, recently, a few friends told me how they'd rank it as one of their favorite shows of all time.  After a year of putting it off, I finally checked it out.  I watched a few episodes a night until it was done.  Everyday I was so excited to see what would happen next.  The characters aren't all likeable...there were a few that I would dread their scenes and storylines (jenny's dad for example) but it didn't stop me from watching the scenes.  The way the show is written is like nothin i'd ever really seen before.  A drama but still doses of comedy that would make me laugh out loud (espescially scenes including the narrator).
I was shocked to hear it only lasted 7 episodes before it was pulled from the network.  It deserved much better than that.  I just watched all the episodes a few months ago and am ready to watch them all again.  It made me a true fan of Paul Haggis and several of the actors included.  Jonathan Tucker, Olivia Wilde serval others including the guy who played Eddie on Grounded For Life.  The lead from Cloverfield even plays on of the brothers but I hadn't a clue until I saw it on imdb.com. He's just that different on the show.
If your a fan of shows with crime, mob bosses, family and what not. I'd say check this show out.  I'm not sure what else to compare it to.
I don't write reviews often but felt I needed to with this show.  It's that good.",1293235200,5,1555,4.227118644067796

Excellent acting from everyone (especially from brothers Tommy and Kevin, and Tommy's drug-addicted girfriend), but these chracters have very few redeeming qualities so it's hard to root for any of them after a while. Also, too many people get stabbed, kicked to death, chopped up, etc. without any apparent remorse or reflection on the part of the perpetrators.

The characters were cast pretty much right on point, from the major characters like Jonathan Tucker to the smaller characters like Kevin Conway.

Some of the story lines on this show were terrific, some were completely boring and made my head feel numb.  4 of the regular actors were great, and most of the rest looked like they were trying to find a common ground between Brigadoon and The Sopranos.

The fake NY Irish accents are terrible, and borderline offensive to those of us who grew up in modern day NY.  I know this show was supposed to draw upon the ""roots"" of the Irish in NY, but it would have to be set sometime between the 1930s and 1970s for these accents to be considered anything but cartoonish.

I won't say exactly which actors or story lines I liked and disliked, because I wouldn't want to skew your opinion of them.

Apparently, America is more interested in being fed more ""reality"" trash TV than well done, thoughtful and gripping drama such as the Donnellys. Or perhaps NBC thinks that little of it's viewers. Either way, it's a shame that this never truly saw the light of day.

Since the initial numbers weren't high enough, NBC - constantly struggling bastard stepchild of the big three networks - pulled the plug on a true gem of a show. These episodes end in a perfect setup for a smash of a second season, which we will (unfortunately) never see. Shame on NBC for pandering to the lesser appetites of it's viewers.

I believe Prison Break is a case in point.

I didn't think it could sustain it's popularity if Tommy went ""too"" far over to the dark side. It's appeal was in the very fact that it was an ""against all odds"" morality play. I don't know why they pulled it, but Tommy had already reached ""the point of no return"". Would he have turned back, we'll never know.

One character I really loved was Joey ""Ice Cream""; the show was going to be called ""The Truth According to Joey Ice Cream"", a mistake smartly corrected. I thought Joey's sardonic character, with his penchant for exaggeration and self importance, was played to the hilt by actor ""Keith Nobbs"". Narration has become the new fad of TV dramas as of late, but Joey added some great humor, and in my opinion, the best so far.

I am a great fan of Jonathan Tucker's and was excited that he was starring in a gritty, underworld-driven crime program set in Boston.  Tommy Donnelly was a believable character whose deeply registered ambivalence about his background, his neighborhood, and his life's direction were keenly felt by the viewer.

And the rest of the cast was excellent as well, particularly Jim Guiry as Jimmy Donnelly (one was torn between pitying him and being grateful one didn't accidentally wander into his bar) and Kate Mulgrew as the tough-as-nails Donnelly matriarch, Helen.

Violent, seamy, and charming, ""Donnellys"" was quality programming.  Why NBC abandoned it is beyond comprehension, as so much of their lineup (excepting the revered ""Law & Order"" franchise) is worthless.  All their network's bigwigs need to do is peruse Amazon's unending 5-star ratings of ""Donnellys"" to recognize the error of their dispatching this show to the dustbin.

But the marketing strategies by NBC are what led to its cancellation. I was soooo extremely disappointed that it got cancelled. I had never been so sad to see an excellent cast and story drop from the tube since the Wonder Years. I know the show ended on a halt, and there were so many sub-plots that could have been delved into much deeper (Jenny and her stalker ex-boyfriend, the feud between the Donnelly family and Dokie Farrell, the money misplaced by Jenny's father & taken by the postman, justice for the Donnelly brothers' father).

2883841,5,B000S8CLR4,"After sitting straight through DVDs of all of OZ, the first two seasons of THE WIRE, and most of RESCUE ME, it was a pleasure to discover that THE BLACK DONNELLYS could deliver the same dark, high quality (especially in the photography) without a constant, lazy peppering of the F word.

With a nod to the cultural agar of EZ STREETS and BROTHERHOOD, this show surprises with its wit and, unlike most network crime dramas, its actually having something to say. Perhaps if NBC had not scheduled it to compete with a CBS blockbuster and it hadn't replaced a loser series that had conditioned audiences to stick with the other networks, it would have succeeded on non-cable TV.

But another factor is the bleak stupidity of the brothers' decisions that serve as plot sparks.  The actors are pretty and talented, but the noir hopelessness of their choices can be offputting.  Therefore, I might have not continued to watch to the end of a network episode, but am altogether comfortable with this product as the DVD of what's basically the grist of a successful cable series.

P.S.:  It's especially nice to see Kate Milgrew play such a different character from Janeway, and to capture the character so well.  It would've been even nicer if (as with the mother on BROTHERHO0D) the mother's world could've been expanded to include, say, a sister played by Mare Willingham.",1194480000,4,1366,4.811965811965812

If you have preconceived notions, then you should trash them and watch it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I love it and it was a borderline obsession.

The story had the kind of depth that a network could ride for years.  It's grassroots Godfather in present-day US.  I felt like I was watching the humble beginnings of a truely great crime-family.

I bought all of the episodes off of itunes every week and it just got better every week. I was instantly hooked from the get go. If it wasn't for Law and Order SVU I would never turn on NBC.

I'm still flummoxed as to why this show was cancelled, it's amazing, emotionally wrenching, easily some of the best tv ever. I know it sounds cheesy but I seriously laugh and cry through every episode. I had myself a Black Donnellys marathon the day this set came in.

2883850,5,B000S8CLR4,"Relying more on the the depth of the characters than violence and bravado, The Black Donnellys is an intelligent show that succeeds where most ""mob"" series fail: network television.

I was skeptical myself of a network show about organized crime. It's been tried before and has always failed miserably. Even the Soprano's doesn't work  on A&E. The Black Donnellys is 10 times the show the Sopranos was. I think the biggest problem was that it came out just as the Sopranos was coming to an end and many people were over mob series. Once people watch the show they are able to see that this show is about much more than the crime.

The show's strong point is it's writing. Using the rise of the Donnellys to the head of the Irish mob in New York as a background, the show is really about the complexities of human emotion and actions and how they are shaped by culture and experience.

Everyone should buy this DVD now and maybe we can save the show!!!!",1189641600,7,952,4.485549132947977

Its very smartly written and has very few flaws (for example - in the second episode tommy and kevin leave the bar and then approx. 5 minutes later, you see them in a van and tommy asks ""did you lock up the bar"").  NBC cancelled it and replaced it with the reality show ""The Real Wedding Crashers""...wow, fantastic.  That show didn't last very long at all (3 episodes).

The role of Jimmy Donnelly was a difficult, complex role to play and ran the gamut of emotions. Thomas Guiry had the role nailed from the first episode, and just got better and better with each one.
The same goes for Peter Greene (Dokey Farrell) and Kirk Acevedo (Nicky Cottero)in the Best Supporting Actor category. For Best Supporting Actress, Kate Mulgrew (Helen Donnelly) and Betsy Beutler (Jimmy's girlfriend Joanie) both turned in nomination worthy performances. In fact, this is the only show on TV this year that I can say every single cast member was great. There was not a bad performance by anyone, right down to smallest of roles. Other performers worth mentioning are Jonathan Tucker, who portrays the young, conflicted family leader Tommy Donnelly,  and Billy Lush, whose subtle portrayal of Kevin Donnelly gets stronger and stronger with each episode as his character develops.

There are not many shows that make you feel like you are best friends with the characters and can relate to the decisions  they make.  This show did that, and losing it kills.",1183075200,8,669,3.8175182481751824
2883880,5,B000S8CLR4,"The networks continue to pump junk down the throats of mind-numbed dumplings who I suppose want another season of Idol and more reality TV junk.  Too bad for an excellent piece of work like TBD which captured a large audience, and treated them to a quality story, not one dumbed down and marketed for the soundbite and latte' crowd.  Shame on NBC for not listening to their fans, and shame on any other network for not picking up a show that is sure to do nothing but grow a loyal and true audience.  Kudos to the writes and the actors, but shame again on NBC.",1183075200,77,560,4.314285714285714
2883881,5,B000S8CLR4,"I saw the episodes that aired on TV and some of the ones that were online. It is just such a hassle that NBC switched it to online only. I want to watch my shows on my big TV, not my computer. I really look forward to the DVDs so I can see all the episodes and the extra scenes. I can only hope some network sees the potential this show has and picks it up.",1183075200,8,357,3.710526315789474
2883882,5,B000S8CLR4,"This is the only show I ever bought a season pass to  on itunes and made a point to watch it when it came on TV, and now I can't wait to have the DVD's so I can watch it on the TV again. If you like Sopranos or the boondock saints you'll love this series.",1182988800,8,255,3.5535714285714284
2883883,5,B000S8CLR4,"Simply the best series I have ever seen on television and was shocked that NBC cancelled it. I am purchasing the DVD and writing this review so as to call attention to the large following behind this epic drama. My hope is that the ""powers that be"" will pull their thumbs out and initiate a second season.",1182988800,7,305,4.368421052631579
2883884,5,B000S8CLR4,"This show has brought a lot of people together and I know that it's fans are truly in shock by NBC's descion. I decided to order this product because of the emails I get everyday asking me why they cancelled such an awesome show. I have really no news to say at the moment, but I know that one of my co-workers recently reunited with some of the crew to discuss season 2. I don't exactly know how that went because she hasn't emailed me back, nor have I heard anything from anyone else, but The Black Donnellys is one hell of show. Therefore, there is absolutly no reason why you shouldn't buy it.",1182902400,16,597,4.245614035087719
2883885,5,B000S8CLR4,"The show was written by Oscar award winning writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco (crash).  The show was largely based on Bobby Moresco's life and Hell's Kitchen.  TBD is narrated by Joey ""Ice Cream"" and follows four Irish brothers, Tommy, Kevin, Jimmy and Sean Donnelly who place family above all and find themselves catapulted into a life they never dreamed of.  In the pilot episode, Tommy and Kevin do the unthinkable to save their brother Jimmy from himself and to keep him and the family out of harms way...and this is where it all begins.  Throughout the season, we see the emotions erupt, motives unravel and suspicions revisited.  This show offers drama, comedic relief, emotions and most of all, family.",1182902400,9,713,4.908333333333333
2883886,5,B000S8CLR4,"Like everyone else here I agree that this was a show worth fighting for.  It was such a good start to a series.  It is smart and entertaining.  The characters are great.  The humor and drama are well balanced and there is a great chemistry between the brothers.  This show got slaughtered in the ratings because no one knew about it, the advertising couldn't decide how to sell it which ended up making no sense to people that didn't watch the show, the time slot was Monday nights after prime time which is the only worse spot then Friday early evening. If anyone at NBC reads these, please know you made a huge mistake by dropping this show.  This would have become a cult classic.",1182816000,11,683,4.424
2883887,5,B000S8CLR4,The Black Donnellys is in my opinion the most amazing show on television. I say is because it's still on television on HDNet. Please check it out if you have that channel. You won't be disappointed. The cast is full of amazing actors and the crew are some of the best in the business. Buy the DVD collection when it comes out. You'll want it in your collection so you can watch it over and over whenever you want. And I guarantee that you'll want to.,1182816000,12,450,4.244186046511628
2883888,5,B000S8CLR4,"I can't wait for this DVD set to be released.  I am an avid television watcher and The Black Donnellys was at the top of my Tivo Season Pass list.  While it took a couple of episodes to fully develop the characters and storylines, I was never disappointed.  Viewers should be patient because this is the best television show I've seen in a long, long time.  In fact, I would gladly give up every single television show I watch to have The Black Donnellys back on the air--NBC cancelled it way too soon.  I can only hope that the DVD sales motivate the creators and another smarter network to go ahead and develop season 2.",1182816000,9,622,4.373913043478261
2883889,5,B000S8CLR4,"The Black Donnellys is an amazing show that never should have been cancelled.  The acting, writing and plotlines are outstanding.  I was captivated by this show right from the pilot, and I'm not a huge fan of the mob genre.  It is a shame that it was never allowed to reach the audience it should have.  Throughout the season each episode just got better and better.  This is a must have for anyone's collection.",1182816000,67,412,4.513513513513513

If you missed it now is the time to buy it and see how truly great it is. You won't be sorry. The writing and acting are far and away better than anything I've seen in ages, including the Sopranos. It's a shame it was cancelled but hopefully after they see all the fan support someone else will pick it up.",1182816000,11,422,4.158536585365853

2883892,5,B000S8CLR4,"I have NEVER been compelled to try and save a show ever.....until NOW.
This had to be the only show out there worth my valuable time.
It had a great plot, excellent characters. The only thing it didn't have was proper time slot and any advertisement. I happened to stumble across it just minutes before the first show aired! I was hooked! I felt like I was watching a great movie story unfold each week. I couldn't stand the wait. All the people on the show were vital...even down to the ones you might have hated. (Nicky) Or the ones that just plain scared you!(Dokey)
I could only hope and pray that HBO or someone picks it up and keeps it going. until then I will wait for the box set.",1182816000,10,688,4.259541984732825
