8141833,4,B000HWZ4HK,"So glad I purchased this season! The quality is fine and the audio is clear. Can't recall the special features being anything spectacular, but I mainly just watch the episodes. Overall, this is a great product that I would purchase again.",1512691200,,238,4.829268292682927

8141835,5,B000HWZ4HK,"A wonderful introduction to my favourite show of all: 7th Heaven. I remember being given this set for Christmas a few years ago. I must have been 19 at the time because I distinctly remember unwrapping it and hugging it with a massive smile on my face and thinking maybe I was too old to behave in such a way. The point is, this is one of those very special shows that if you've seen it once in the past, you will want to follow into your adulthood.

I grew up with the Camden kids so to speak and loved learning a new lesson or appreciating the feeling of goodness and morality that 7th Heaven made me feel after each episode. If you've even watched one episode in the past and enjoyed it, I am assure you this set is well-worth the buy and will get you hooked on the show for good.

10/10.",1251504000,,791,4.12987012987013
8141836,4,B000HWZ4HK,"It's not easy finding wholesome clean shows for the kids these days, but this is one show they watch over and over and has good life lessons and values.",1207353600,,152,4.275862068965517
8141837,5,B000HWZ4HK,"My mum is hooked to this show and I must admit it ain't bad. It's a bit cheesy although a Christian TV Show was always going to be. Doesn't mention Jesus' name as often as I would like, but at least they mention it lol. God is great!",1178928000,,233,3.875
8141838,4,B000HWZ4HK,"I am a lil over halfway through the first season of the show, and I can go and watch the show from the series premier, which i missed. My mom actually found this show a couple weeks into it's maden season and i think the following week I started watching it with her, and since then we've been faithful watching the series and can appreciate watching a show with good ol' fashioned morals (what a concept in this day and age)and focuses on everyday obsticules (i.e. alcholism, sexual harrassment, racial discrimination are among the things looked at in Season 1). And if you had been following the show and wonder where Mary (Biel) went her way to hitting rock bottom, elements are scattered here and there.

Well worth the money. Can't wait for Season 4 to come out",1168992000,2,766,4.550724637681159
8141839,5,B000HWZ4HK,I'm just happy you were able to get it here for Christmas I looked all over for this product and only found it here.,1168300800,,116,3.875
