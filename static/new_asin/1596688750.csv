It really doesn't give you any ideas or instructions.  The author basically tells you to find your own style of writing. Not much help at all!  No techniques taught in this book. Oh, don't buy the dvd either. Didn't realize it was the same author as the book. Sucks!",1497484800,,430,4.605263157894737

7799795,4,1596688750,"I have found this useful, even if I only got a few things from it. In my opinion, there are so many methods for doing lettering, it never hurts to have a reminder of something you had forgotten.",1387756800,3,194,4.131578947368421
7799796,5,1596688750,"This DVD by Joanne Sharpe is one of the best videos on hand lettering I have seen to date.  She inspires you to use your own natural handwriting as the base to create many different types of creative letters/words which are hand lettered. I mostly use stencils or traced computer fonts in a lot of my wall hangings.  However at times these methods are limited in the effect I want to create and this DVD gives me some other very creative options and is more spontaneous than tracing or using stencils.  I will use this DVD over and over for inspiration and as a refresher to the techniques given in this video.  An important addition to my DVD library of instruction and inspiration. I highly recommend this DVD to scrapbook enthusiasts, mixed media artists, and art quilters who use text in their art.",1366070400,10,802,4.5874125874125875
