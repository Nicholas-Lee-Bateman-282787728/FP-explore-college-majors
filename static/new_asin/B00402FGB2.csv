8411612,5,B00402FGB2,"I haven't watched them all but the price is certainly right for so many fun films.  I love the movie ""Speechless.""",1390953600,,114,4.428571428571429
8411613,3,B00402FGB2,"Could barely watch Speechless, and probably will never watch Real Men or Making Mr. Right.  But worth the price to try them all.",1362614400,,128,4.565217391304348
8411614,5,B00402FGB2,"I ordered this product because for the 6 movies mentioned at this price, how could it not be worth it. Only thing is, The Woman in Red is not one of the 6 movies that came in the package, but Baby Boom with Diane Keaton did. Still a fantastic 6 pack no matter how you look at, so completely satisfied!",1356220800,8,301,4.033333333333333
8411615,5,B00402FGB2,Now that we've switched over to DVD (from VHS tapes) I find I am running out of shelf space and need to economize with my DVD selections. This package contains 6 excellent movies yet takes up very little shelf space. These are 6 comedies that make for excellent evening entertainment for 6 nights straight... can't beat that!,1341792000,2,325,4.719298245614035
8411616,4,B00402FGB2,"I bought the package because I saw a little bit of ""Overboard"" on TV and wanted to have the whole movie on a DVD. Two of the other movies were good, so I got more than my money's worth from the purchase.",1335744000,,203,3.857142857142857
