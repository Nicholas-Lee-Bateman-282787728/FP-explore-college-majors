1748915,5,B00006FMBQ,I have used the Wee Sing tapes for over 15 years. I run a child care program and the children know every song on every Wee Sing tape made.  Thank you so much. A loving Grandma caregiver,1198972800,,185,4.0
1748916,5,B00006FMBQ,"My kids have been watching this for YEARS and have always loved it.  We finally wore out our VHS copy so we recently grabbed it on DVD.  This title is one of the rare kid vids that won't annoy the grown-ups when your kids watch it for the zillionth time!  Let's all sing together now: ""Let's twist again, like we did last summer...""",1039478400,2,332,4.238095238095238
1748917,4,B00006FMBQ,"I got this Video when I was about 6 or 7 (I'm now 14) and I watched it SO many times, I'm obsessed with roller coasters now because of it. This video shows some great footage of Six Flags Magic Mountain, in California. The video is not all about roller coasters, it has flume rides and other rides like bumper cars, also some of the shows. The coasters it shows are:
Colossus - The Biggest Racing coaster at the time of the filming, a great ride in person too.
Revolution - WOW! What a beautiful ride! This was the first succusful 360 Looping coaster, very fun and addictive ride too.
Ninja - One of the best Suspended (Swinging Side-to-Side) Coasters in America, built right on top of Samuri Mountain which is one of the themes to the park.
If you have a Kid that likes rollercoasters, get him this Video. If he/she really enjoys it and wants to go their, take him/her and go have a nice vacation. Heck, you'll even have fun with the 15 coasters they have there, a lot of them record breakers too!",1025395200,10,998,4.342245989304812

1749003,5,B00006FMBQ,"I think this was the last Kidsongs video - (yeah, it was a video back then) we bought for our own children.  They loved the peppy songs and it reminded them of SixFlags that we used to visit in Eureaka, MO.  This DVD uses many of the same actors as they are growing up, so it was actually fun to see them change and grow!  A great way to spend some fun time with your kids that is not controversial in content and you can teach your kids some of the songs we grew up singing too!",1391817600,2,479,3.917525773195876

7967842,5,B00006FMBQ,"A trip down memory lane for me.  My little brother loved these.  Now that I have my own children I wanted something that wasn't Barney.  This video is constant singing with little dialog keeping my 2 year old twins interested. We purchased the ride the roller coaster, a day with the animals, and a day at the circus video also.  (my favorite is ride the roller coaster because it has a few songs adults would actually listen to.. just sung by kids).
Highly recommended
