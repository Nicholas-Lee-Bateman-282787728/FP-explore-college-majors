8265795,5,B0017GBN4S,"This set of Australian movies starring the talented and lovable Magda Szubanski (Babe; The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course) is a true delight for those who love light-hearted, entertaining comedies.  Each one has its own quirky plot, conceived and written by Magda herself, and starring her as crime-solving dog-trainer Margaret O'Halloran.  It's a shame these movies aren't available in the American format.  I was lucky enough to see them through my cable TV company here in Thailand, and quickly bought the whole set of movies, twice!  (The first set was way-laid through no fault of Amazon or its seller.)  Great family entertainment, and definitely worth a spot in your home movie library.",1393027200,,697,5.243243243243243
8265796,5,B0017GBN4S,If you are fan of Working Dog stuff and of Madga S then this is a must watch for you. Being a dog lover (and a cattle dog owner) I found this series hilarious and very true. Pity this kind of work doesn't get promoted as much as some of the other rubbish on TV!!,1350864000,,262,3.7818181818181817
