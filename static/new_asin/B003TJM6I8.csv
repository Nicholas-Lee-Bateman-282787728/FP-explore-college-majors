4190461,4,B003TJM6I8,"This DVD is an assortment of episodes from the cartoon series 'The Penguins of Madagascar.' The series was a spin-off from the Madagascar animated movies; the penguins themselves are very, very funny. They are a little bit Star Trek, a little bit James Bond and a little bit The Dirty Dozen - super-commandos masquerading as innocent zoo animals. As their invincible (and slightly crazy) leader - known only as 'Skipper' - says, ""Cute and cuddly, boys - cute and cuddly.""
Appropriate for kids, but funny and appealing for adults, as well. I found myself wishing for more episodes at the end of the disc - so I got&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penguins-of-Madagascar-I-Was-a-Penguin-Zombie/dp/B003XEKXWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penguins of Madagascar: I Was a Penguin Zombie</a>&nbsp;too!

4190463,5,B003TJM6I8,"The 5-year old sits and laughs out loud while he's watching this one. And I have to say, that for me as a grown-up it is pretty funny. And yes, it is episodes, not one whole movie, but I like that for limiting TV time. (""Only two and then we eat dinner."")",1291593600,7,255,3.923076923076923
4190464,4,B003TJM6I8,"Starring the madcap pack of Penguins and everyone's favorite lemur, King Julien, from DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc's phenomenally successful MADAGASCAR franchise, the DVD includes 8 episodes from Nickelodeon's Emmy and Annie Award-Winning series. The episodes each introduce a new character to the zoo.

In the Line of Doody is about the Penguins' attempt to keep a pigeon from taking it's wrath out on a zoo commissioner. We laughed so much. I did have to explain a lot to my 3 year old, but he already thinks tooting and pooing are funny so he caught on fast.

The Big Squeeze is about a new boa constrictor and scared my son so bad we didn't watch all of it.

Out of the Groove was about a new baboon who was a better dancer than Julien. A lot of booty references, but pretty funny.

Skorca! was cracking me up! My son thought the sugar-hyped penguin was ""silly momma""...I wanted to say ""That's you!!!"" Best one of the disk if you ask me!

The Red Squirrel, Jiggles, Untouchable and Cat's Crade are the other episodes on the disk and I laughed through them all. Even the opening credit scene was funny to me.

When this is released, on August 10th, you have to pick up a copy! I think the adults enjoyed it more than the 3 year old, but I'm sure we're going to be watching this for a while to come. Even the 7 month old was interested!

One copy of the disk was provided for me. No additional compensation was provided and I was not required to write  a positive review.",1281312000,61,1474,4.433333333333334

4190500,3,B003TJM6I8,"Look, I'm not inhuman.

Everybody loves Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, with their zany military operations and ""cunning"" plans, not to mention the hilarious band of lemurs - King Julien, Maurice, and Mort. So do I, and when they are onscreen, they really have their moments. The whole audience laughs hard! There are jokes in here that are surprisingly funny, and some cunning word-play and punning occasionally get written in. For that I give the show 4 stars.

But this otherwise good show is hampered by plots so simple they could have come out of a cookie-cutter, some really cheesy and cliched moments, and some episodes that just have some plain bad writing (I shuddered at the episode where Julien loses his crown. It's just bad.) And that's not all. A sizeable portion of the show's humor is just plain crude. I'm not talking about the slapstick, I'm talking about the fart jokes, elephant bottom jokes, and generally poorly written original characters - the otter, the elephants, etc.

In conclusion, when the show sticks to what was in the movies - the hilarious penguins and lemurs, it does well, and everything is often very, very funny. However, there's little else to recommend, and so I deduct 2 stars.

Recommended for little kids (this will keep them occupied for hours, as I know all too well (I have a four year old brother!)).
