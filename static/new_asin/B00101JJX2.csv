8236488,3,B00101JJX2,"I'm a highland games noob and wanted to skip wading through lots of youtube, etc so I went ahead and bought this dvd to learn the movements.  There is tons and tons of footage in slo-mo and real time.  Hours and hours...more than you'll want to watch, really.

However, if you're expecting helpful commentary it's not here.  The narration by the world-champ just reads words that are on the screen as well; thank you but I'm a literate person and I don't need people to read to me.  Nothing extra besides what's put on the screen either, don't think it'll be like a director's commentary on the dvd; it's bare bones.  Each of the commentaries for each movement is about a sentence or two...then just endless footage.  And the commentary is ""put the caber on your shoulder"" and ""run, stop, throw"".  While a few of the explanations talk about key points in the motion, most of it is pretty unhelpful or pretty obvious to someone not familiar with the technique.

There is great footage to watch and break down yourself as well as a few good hints.  Was it worth $35?  It's hard to say...I'll definitely use things from the video, but I expected quite a bit more.

Other than that, the production is pretty horrible (mis-spelled words, grainy footage, bad editing), but I'm not sure it matters much.  You can see the movements and understand the audio commentary...they just had lots of opportunities to commentate better that they didn't take.  :(",1376352000,2,1445,4.682539682539683
