8152678,5,B000JRAO6O,"Great daily routine, combines essential joint mobility exercises, a good basic set of qigong movements, and a great whole body strength exercise (wall squat).

Only downside is that if you want the companion looseleaf book (really just a transcription of the DVD, but helpful), you need to get it directly from Dragon Door.

The routine is flexible enough so you can vary the joint mobility number of repetions and the duration of the qigong movements to fit your schedule - I go through the whole routine in about 20 minutes.

Also, the wall squat, when done facing a wall as described in Pavel Tsatsouline's ""Enter the Kettlebell"" is a great hip flexor/extensor exercise.
