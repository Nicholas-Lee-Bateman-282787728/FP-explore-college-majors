8568502,4,B00BHIQH5Q,"Well, I was somewhat surprised. This is the usual story of a young man who is a patent lawyer and dating the boss's daughter and will be married to her but for his 30th birthday his pals from Louisiana want him to come down for a party to celebrate his birthday and his engagement. The intended doesn't go and well I got quite a few laughs out of this movie esp from Ike Barinholtz, as his longtime best friend. he was the slacker who really did not achieve much. This is a low budget movie but I still enjoyed the performances and the story even though we have seen it a million times. Josh Meyers as the birthday boy does what he is supposed to do and he was fine.",1479340800,,666,4.130769230769231
8568503,3,B00BHIQH5Q,"A lot of the show was filmed right here where I live in St Francisville, but the director / producer was not as exciting as what I thought it would be, kinda okay, the director / producer of the movie would have you thinking that some wild, crazy, cool something was about to happen... Then it was just kind of lame after that.",1446249600,,327,4.2063492063492065
8568504,5,B00BHIQH5Q,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Lafayette, LA probably 2 years ago and absolutely loved it! So happy that it's finally been released.
It's set in Louisiana, but without the usual Hollywood stereotypes of the area and the people that live here. It's hilarious and heartfelt at the same time. I've watched it quite a few times since it was delivered.  Time for a sequel!",1362614400,,375,4.514705882352941

8568506,5,B00BHIQH5Q,"As the host of a film festival, I get to see a ton of films each year. You never really know what you are going to get. However, t was clear from the start that this film should be in movie theaters and homes around the world. Great cast. Great story. And the folks behind making it were some of the nicest people ever. I highly recommend this film! Bill",1362441600,,354,4.071428571428571
8568507,5,B00BHIQH5Q,"If you like ""awkward situations,""  Cajun humor, dysfunctional friends, and great acting, ""Inventing Adam"" delivers in spades. And seeing Josh Meyers and Ike Barinholtz teamed again after their Mad TV years is a special treat.  Across the aisle, Claire Coffee and Alysia Ochse are adorable in their ""rival roles,"" while veteran Ray Wise plays the crass boss and future father-in-law perfectly. A must see movie!",1361491200,,410,5.292307692307692
