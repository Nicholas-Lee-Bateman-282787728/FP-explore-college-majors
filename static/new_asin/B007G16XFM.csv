5084379,1,B007G16XFM,This movie had no real story to it. You have seen the same plot done several times. I found myself day dreaming at times and my mind wondering off while watching this movie... I never really got hooked. I think the girl did a pretty good job in the movie. The rest of the actors were mediocre. Watch at your own risk!,1353196800,,317,4.129032258064516
5084380,1,B007G16XFM,"This review is coming from a guy that enjoyed watching Hercules and Xena. I am fine with corny. I went in with low expectations.  The first 20 minutes or so looked promising. The scenery was pretty, the actors seemed decent... but then things got bad.

This story line is exactly like Man from Snow River. The plot, the characters, the scenes... Highlander falls in love with a girl above him. Jim, Jessica, Matilda, Clancy- they are all there. This is more than generic plots we have all seen, I mean specific scenes and conversations are ripped straight from Man from Snowy River. The stolen mare, Jessica running away and Jim finding her and bringing her back, the scene where the truth about the mothers love comes out, the ranch hands picking on Jim/Will... The first ten minutes and the last 20 are original.  Not good, but original.

The final scene (semi-spoiler, in case you couldn't figure it out by the title the good guy slays the dragon) is really lame.  No ingenious trick, no epic battle... he just walks into the flames of the dragons breath, puts prick in the dragons mouth and... well, then it cuts away and the hero wakes up next to the dragon's body. He isn't burned so I don't know how he got knocked out. This was a tiny prick, not some massive hilt-deep penetration to the back of the throat, just a little prick to the tongue. 2 hours of build up for that?! With so many options this just seems like a disappointing climax. Maybe bring in the sexy heroin to conjure up something cool!

The acting- with low expectations it was still only ok. The main actor runs funny. May not seem like much (and I don't claim to be an awesome runner myself) but when you start laughing during dramatic scenes because of the ""hunky knight"" running then something is wrong. The three ranch hands were the most believable to me, but maybe that is because they were never required to stretch themselves.

Overall- even going in with B film expectations I would rate it a D.",1351987200,2,1978,4.53932584269663
5084381,3,B007G16XFM,"Well executed fantasy movie. Not overwrought, likeable characters, and believable romance. Could use just a smidgeon more dragon to justify the front cover art. Worth watching. Boom microphone does an excellent job of not appearing in this film. Acting is quite decent compared to other films of this type.
With as many poorly done, cheesy movies as there are in this genre, the above should be taken as high praise. If you like slayers and you like dragons, you'll be pleased with this movie.",1349827200,27,493,4.880952380952381
5084382,1,B007G16XFM,"You know the drill: peasant boy loses dear ol' dad to a monster, seeks his fortune with a local lord, becomes a knight, takes revenge on the beastie and wins over the lord's hot daughter on his way to becoming a man of means.  Hopefully you've never seen it done as badly as this.  There's actually worse out there, if it'll make you feel better.

You'll be counting off the cliches as they get tossed at you by 12 people- yeah, the entire cast consists of a grand total of 12 people... who may have also filled in as the production crew.  This is one of those movies that you wish was done by SyFy Channel so it could've been made better.  Imagine a rundown keep staffed by three lousy serfs, home to an aging noble and his nubile daughter who puts on full makeup and a gown to go out and build a rock wall two leagues (six miles) from the tower.  Oh, and the girl is a conjurer or something.  You can tell because even though that's supposed to be a bad thing she openly wears a ring that labels her as one- even our farmboy knew that much- and when she lectures him about the magic within everyone she changes into her goth outfit and dark makeup, just in case you weren't paying attention.  And there's a good chance you're not.

Q: what do you get when you cross a salamander and a seahorse?  A: the design model for the 'dragon'.  This thing couldn't scare Casper on a bad night.  Ray Harryhausen is 91 years old and could make a better monster right now!

The dialogue is typical B-movie fare- stiff, wooden and cheesy- and when combined with some of the accents makes for several spots you won't understand a blasted thing being said... like it really matters.  Extended sequences about much of nothing take away from what little exposition there is, so story leaps are made through the dialogue that just make you say 'well, of course', since it's all cliches anyway.

The young actors gave it a good effort.  Leads Richard McWilliams as Will the Farm Boy and Nicola Posener as Kate are earnest and do the best they can while Philip Brodie as Rowan, the evil cad is just corny.  And I swear Anthony Murphy as Tom, Will's father, looked like he couldn't wait to get killed off.

This is some seriously low-budget tripe.  I got more out of listening to the score than watching the movie.  Don't bother with this unless you're snowed in somewhere with plenty of beer and pretzels.",1334534400,7,2386,4.404109589041096

5084384,5,B007G16XFM,"I'm a true Romantic. I don't care if the movie is A or B if its has a good love story line. Enjoying any Romantic happy ending movie gets my endorphins boiling.  Happy endings in real life are not part of this world. When there is a chance for me to see happy ending of love and unity, it takes me away daily real life  news and  escape .

5084493,1,B007G16XFM,"I just can't believe all the 5 star ratings. Either it's a love story or a dragon slayer story. The answer: neither. It is a poorly executed story with a few (actually only 3) dragon scenes in the entire movie. At one point an hour and 10 minutes go by without a single scene with a dragon in it. Okay, you say it's not really a dragon movie then why call it ""Dawn of the Dragon Slayer"" and slap a picture of a dragon spewing fire on the cover art? The acting isn't terrible but the story line is. The movie shows horses going through the same path no less than 15 times but suggests it is some other part of the country.  The giveaway that this movie just sucks is the fact they have only 7 or eight different actors throughout the entire movie. Yeah, definitively low budget. Spoiler alert. The male and female love interests suddenly get special powers at the end of the movie which protects them from the dragons bad breath, I mean fire breath...what! Oh, never mind.

Many of these lower budget movies have acting that is so incredibly awful that you just have to give up five to ten minutes into the film.  I didn't have that issue with this movie.

Actually, this would make a really good film if the screen play was fleshed out a bit more.  It has a lot to offer.  This is coming from someone who likes adventure movies ""sprinkled"" with a bit of magic and romance.",1465776000,2,503,4.242105263157895

I did enjoy it, though I wish it were a little better written - there is quite a bit of potential in the script if it were further developed.

The dragon, well, by today's standards it was almost old-school stop-motion, and not well melded into the scenes.  It also seemed a bit smaller than the 40' length & 80' wide description given by the protagonist.

That being said, the dragon fight scenes were not so well done - reminded me of an 80's style TV show, where something like this would have been cutting edge.  And, to be honest, I almost felt like I was watching the Power Rangers show.

The story was very compelling and kept me watching to see how it went.  Often these movies would be easy to predict but this one had me.

However, the relatively simple story is well executed,  and the protagonists are very likable.  The CGI is better than you would think.  At its core this movie is a love story and overcoming obstacles to achieve your dreams and true love.  The acting is good enough and there is just enough action thrown in, especially when combined with the stunning landscapes, to keep your attention and even want more.

Whoever wrote the script and directed it did a great job conveying a story.  Great scenery, great music - the actors and actresses carried the story.  I'm not sure if I interpreted his final sword correctly but a brief sighting in one scene made it appear chipped and well-used rather than shiny-never-out-of-the-box, and the camera didn't hype on such a minor detail.

The movie itself is pretty boring, but the characters and story are not to bad. There is also a lot of pretty visuals of the landscape (Ireland?) and seems to have halfway decent production value. The CG dragon doesn't look that bad at all! It looks and moves a lot better then most direct-to-video monsters!... it's also obviously a ""Reign of Fire"" rip-off (as all dragons are nowadays). I really thought it was the best part of the movie.
All n' all the movie was okay i thought. Give it a go! I wouldn't buy it though... check it out on netfix, rent it, or watch bits of it on youtube. If you like direct-to-video dragon flicks... i recommend ""Dragon Storm"" or ""Dragon Fighter"" over this one.",1389225600,,860,4.554838709677419

Some reviewers seem to want this to be a monster Hollywood epic, but I loved the movie's focus on a smaller number of characters, which lets us get to know them better. This gives us a more personal, soulful film.

In some ways the story of the poor shepherd boy who captures a lady's heart and defeats a dragon mirrors the struggle of the indie filmmaker to win over an audience in the face of giant blockbusters. And like Will the shepherd, this fantasy film rises to the challenge and comes off conqueror. It's an underdog that really overachieves.",1379030400,,710,4.772357723577236

5084683,5,B007G16XFM,"People are too used to films with multimillion dollar budgets with top stars demanding millions just to star in them.  Those are the people that do not grasp the Indie Film concept.  They are generally labors of love created on a shoestring or zero budget, created to tell a story that the creators envisioned and want to share with others.

Dawn of the Dragonslayer is one of these films.  Sure the effects were not made by a studio with limitless resources.  The fact that a group of individuals could get together and put this film together on their own is quite exciting.  Not only did they complete a feature film, but it is on par with some of the other fantasy films released by some major studios, on a budget less than 5% and a crew of insignificant scale to those same studios.  I tip my hat to them.

The story is an age old one that never gets old for me.  The script was well done, even if some of the lines were executed a little woodenly by the actors.  But keep in mind that these are fresh actors that we may well be seeing on the screen for the first time... bringing another level of excitement to viewing this film.  Sean Connery and Harrison Ford had to start somewhere, and I guarantee they started out looking just as shaky.

So if you like the concept of Indie Films, this one is a fun way to get lost for an hour and a half.",1363910400,12,1349,4.247058823529412

5084685,3,B007G16XFM,"There seems to be two widely different opinions of this film. On the one hand, it's a dour attempt at telling a story that's less about slaying dragons and more about a ""paladins"" (in the D&D sense, not one of the twelve peers of Charlemagne's Court) in Ireland with passable CGI effects.  On the other hand it's a surprisingly nuanced fantasy tale that stands out in a cesspool of barely scripted monster-of-the-week drek. The answer is somewhere in between those two extremes.

""Dawn of the Dragonslayer"" is the story of paladin-to-be Will (Richard McWilliams), a shepherd's son out for revenge against the dragon that killed his father and destroyed his livelihood. He approaches Baron Sterling (Ian Cullen) to learn the ways of a knight and make his way in the world. After suffering repeated rejection and abuse by Sterling and his servants, Will eventually becomes part of his retinue.  He can't help but notice Sterling's attractive daughter Kate (Nicola Posener), a relationship complicated by the arrival of nobleman Rogan (Philip Brodie) who requests her hand in marriage. Then the dragon shows up again and everyone is out for the gold a dragon's egg will bring the barony.

At heart this is a romance film, which will disappoint monster buffs looking for a lot of dragon action.  It's a fantasy film too, but the plot is more grounded in the mundanity of medieval living than your typical dungeonpunk sword-and-sorcery flick. This amounts to the relatively small cast talking to each other a lot -- it seems there's only ten people in total in all of Ireland.

Taken as a fantasy romance, ""Dawn of the Dragonslayer"" is surprisingly good. The film's name was changed from ""Paladin,"" which may be appropriate given that ""paladinhood"" means that Will is resistant to fire and that's about it.

Although ""Dawn of the Dragonslayer"" is no ""Dragonslayer,"" it's distinct enough to warrant a viewing by fantasy fans.  Just expect to see more of the gorgeous Ireland scenery than the dragon.",1362268800,20,1993,4.963963963963964

8516161,5,B007G16XFM,I really enjoyed this movie. The dragons a meal ole beasty. I hate when people rate movies like they are crittics. I liked it a decent dragon flick.,1525996800,,148,4.321428571428571
8516162,5,B007G16XFM,"Tremendous picture, although a ""B"" movie in the artistry of the actors, I would most definitely give them a B+ for effort. The music score by Panu Aaltio was phenominal, excellent arrangement, added so much heart and feeling to the entire film, and then coupled with the location filming In Ireland, a great back drop to a wonderful written story. The costumes of the period were spot on, kudos to wardrobe, especially with most likely a limited budget. If your looking for Lord of the Rings, then go buy it, but if you are looking for a great film, with heart and spirit and definitely fun to watch, then this is the film for you.",1525478400,,631,4.495652173913044

8516165,5,B007G16XFM,"I found that this proverbial ""Dragon"" Movie was excellent for the reason of no nudity and the Hero of the story made Positive Moral  decisions regarding the Love of his Life and, I think the special effects of the Dragon were excellent also...watched many Dragon movies and this was a top ten......",1516147200,2,298,4.730769230769231
8516166,2,B007G16XFM,"That is what this flic should really be called. But unlike the spectacular Australian cowboy movie that this was lifted from, it doesnt have any of its charms. I mainly kept watching to see if Spur would show up and have a sparring match with his grumpy yet successful twin brother. Its a farce, as far as adaptations *cough* plagiarism *cough* go, but it kept me sniggering all the way through, so there must be some entertainment value, other than a likable male lead and a cute female lead. Oh, and Magic Underwear!",1514073600,,518,4.580645161290323
