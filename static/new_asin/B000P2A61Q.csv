On the whole, it is not too vague or detailed; it has a nice balance. As I mentioned, the footage is great too.

To anyone interested in Africa, history, or increasing their basic level of worldly knowledge, I wholeheartedly recommend this film.

If you want, you can grab it on Amazon's Createspace for a little less. createspace.___/219015 Use the code: ALLXKLKB for 10 percent off.

Hope this helps.",1242777600,,628,4.63063063063063
