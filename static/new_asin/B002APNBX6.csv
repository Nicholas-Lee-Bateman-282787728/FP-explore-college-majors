8359959,2,B002APNBX6,"Two-thirds waste of money.  The first disc, ""Man on the Tracks,"" would not upload due to ""disc error.""  The second, ""Bad Luck,"" did play normally (but w/o the advertised subtitles.  I nevertheless could figure it out.)  The third, ""Eroica"" - well, it's hard to rate an empty cassette upon opening.  Obviously PoleArt has no quality control when shipping this out, so as a *product rating* (as opposed to content) buyer beware or you're stuck with unusable plastic junk.  The two stars for this ""trilogy"" are for the sake of the one film I could watch, of the two that were actually found in their cases.",1485734400,,603,4.695238095238095
