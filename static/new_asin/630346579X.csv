7848754,5,630346579X,"This has rapidly become my favorite video of all of my Jazz Guitar collection I have. I very much like all of the songs on this album and they have added a bonus section on several songs which Wes Montgomery played with his quartet and this is very nice to listen to this music, but don't know why it is recorded in black-and-white instead of as the rest, in color; except probably I guess they didn't have color video-recorders back in the older days when these recording were made of Montgomery. But other then that, this is an excellent video to add to my collection of both old, traditional Jazz guitar artists and I would recommend it to everyone who likes the sounds of electronic Jazz guitars.",1388448000,,700,4.519685039370079
7848755,5,630346579X,"For me, currently in my 50s, having played jazz guitar myself for years, this is as good as it gets. I love the man--he was so at peace with himself when playing, the lines just flowed from his heart and spirit, always an expression of peace and a smile on his face. That he died so young is a tragedy; the influence he had on jazz is incalculable. I watched this video with a friend and fellow Wes fan, and we were both in tears at the simple beauty that emanated from this man and his guitar, and the love that he expressed in his songs. If you want to see a video of the real thing, this is it, pure and simple.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-Jazz-Guitar-Vol-1/dp/B00005NX1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of Jazz Guitar, Vol. 1</a>",1332115200,,788,5.022900763358779
7848756,2,630346579X,"Other than the Wes Montgomery footage the audio is terrible.  Why wasn't this re-mastered?
Its worth it for the ""bonus"" of Wes in Belium but the others are just awful video transfers.",1297900800,,183,4.71875
7848757,5,630346579X,"My fiance is a guitarist and I bought this for his birthday.  We both love jazz and I knew I would enjoy this dvd as much as him, but we were both blown away! - Rare footage of some great artist!  A great buy!!",1206921600,,210,3.75
7848758,5,630346579X,"This video is an exhuberant celebration of the creative genius of four giants of jazz guitar. The purpose of this video is to give those of us who were not fortunate enough to see these guitarists play live an opportunity to see their personalities. Here are some of the observations that I made that are irrelevant to the lush richness of the music, but that made me feel like I learned something about the musicians:

1. Wes Montgomery smiling ebulliently as several times he dodges an errant microphone boom on Belgian public television. Nothing bothered him.
2. A picture quality so clear that you can see the dust between the pickup and the neck on Joe Pass's guitar.
3. Herb Ellis scowling grouchily while his bassist is so happy to be playing with Herb Ellis that he nearly bounces off the dais on which he's perched.
4. The light glinting off the tuning head of Joe Pass's guitar like the Star of Bethlehem on a Christmas card.
5. An intensity in Barney Kessel's eyes that belies the beauty of the song he's playing.
6. Four guys who owned their music so completely that they dressed up in coats and ties (and ,in Joe Pass's case, a tuxedo) to celebrate themselves and the music they played.
7. Barney Kessel and Herb Ellis playing on Swedish public TV with sidemen who looked like they just stepped of a Viking longboat.
8. Joe Pass's humble demeanor that belies the intense concentration with which he burned up and down his fingerboard.
9. Did I mention that there are bonus Wes Montgomery tracks? There are bonus Wes Montgomery tracks!

Every guitartist should own this video; there's a depth of emotion in the music that has been missing in popular music for at least 20 years.",1204416000,8,1690,4.63
7848759,5,630346579X,"This dvd has some of the best jazz on film. The bonus footage includes the entire set from Belgium. You'll also be wanting Vol. 2 for the rest of the BBC set (two clips from the BBC are not on Vol. 1).

This dvd shows Wes playing in a very relaxed atmosphere and he clearly is enjoying himself. I've never seen any footage of Wes before so this dvd is a welcome addition to my home. Yes, I love the others on this dvd, but Wes is my favorite guitarist I've ever heard.",1174435200,10,468,4.032258064516129

7848762,5,630346579X,This is an amazing dvd. I am a guitarist and have been searching for footage of Wes Montgomery since I discovered his playing. It is a treat to see him execute those great lines with such ease. A great study on the artistry of one of the greatest jazz guitarist of all time. The bonus material of Wes in Belguim makes it a definite bargain. A must have for the serious jazz guitarist. I own all 3 volumes of Legends of Jazz Guitar.,1122940800,20,431,4.204819277108434
