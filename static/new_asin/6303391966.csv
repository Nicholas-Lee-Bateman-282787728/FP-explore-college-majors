7845370,3,6303391966,"While the scenes with Shannon Tweed aren't that great,you do get to ser her [body] quite a few times(though alot of the scenes are in a slow motion style).There are other scenes without her however,that are pretty good. The main one I'm referring to is the one with Shannon Tweed's character's husband(I can't remember her name in the movie)and the big-breasted brunette having [adult contact] against the desk in his office,and then on his couch.
At least rent this one to check it out,then draw your own conclusions.",1021248000,,518,4.8977272727272725
