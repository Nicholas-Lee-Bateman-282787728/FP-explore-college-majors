8545875,5,B00A0E18TI,"There is a  vast river of drug dealing, violent celluloid exploitation films that at one time seemed almost inescapeable if one watched popular cinema from Latin America.  I found myself thinking of those films as I watched this one, but what a difference great directing, acting, writing & production values make. There is almost a kind of delicacy here even as we watch the unraveling of cold-hearted & also beautiful lives dancing side by side, inches apart.  Sometimes all of this takes place in a matter of moments in the same frame,  each action held onto preciously like a secret breath of air. This is not the story of Ozzie & Harriet. It is a confusing mashup.  The quality of story-telling makes me think of Days of Heaven.  Quite an accomplishment for a film about a very different world with much less fortunate lives. Highly recommended.",1366502400,,850,4.787671232876712
