Now for the movie itself. This was a really refreshing film. It had a definite indie feel to it with a lot of dry humor and deliberate pace to it. It showed you just enough and did an excellent job of making the viewer feel like they were moving along with the story rather than rushing through. In my opinion this is really what made the movie 'work' as it helped to tie the anecdotal source material being presented with the film. In other words, all the elements worked together to make the film funny but not overblown as many comedies tend to do. All in all a really enjoyable rainy day film.",1489449600,,645,4.338842975206612
