8706806,5,B00UGQF9NQ,"Executive Action, 1973 film

The movie begins with a quote from President Lyndon B. Johnson. He suspected a conspiracy caused the assassination of JFK. They show various industrial scenes as the credits roll. It is June 1963. A voice talks about the Kennedy Brothers and warns about their powers. JFK's actions are criticized. A Test Ban Treaty! Withdrawal from Vietnam! The men talk about an ""executive action"". We see a speech by JFK about progress for the people. They talk about presidential assassinations by fanatics. One man explains how this will work. Practice makes perfect. We hear the analysis of JFK' protection. This conspiracy will use a victim as a ""lone gunman"" to take the blame. We see men shooting at a target in a moving open car.

Newsreels from June 1963 tell about a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Jim Farrington meets one leader and explains the deal. ""You just told me who we are going to hit."" JFK speaks about Civil Rights. The conspirators have a ""sponsor"" for their plot. They review his history. They will use him. One plotter speaks about the need for population control of people in other countries. ""Somebody must be behind him."" A speech in Washington is seen by the top man. Oswald is arrested for handing out leaflets, this is photographed [advance planning]. JFK signs the Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. Men with telescopic camera lens take pictures of a parade. We see the plot taking place for Dealey Plaza. The report of a future withdrawal from Vietnam makes Ferguson give the ""go ahead"". They send a coded message to a team leader. They got the job. They use a double to impersonate the ""sponsor"" and leave a false trail. Men break into a garage to steal a rifle. They create an incriminating photograph. [Easier today with digital photography.]

Was there a plot to demonstrate against Adlai Stevenson? The assassins reconnoiter the locations. Exact planning assures success. The President and Vice-President will be in Dallas together. ""Oswald has his telephone number?"" Oswald's mail and telephone are monitored by government agencies. [Like most other people?] JFK is greeted in Fort Worth, then flies to Dallas. The people cheer him. The assassins move into their positions. We see actual news photographs mixed in with this movie. [Just like ""Twelve O'Clock High"".] People watch this live on television. The assassins fire. The police search the Texas School Book Depository building. The telephone lines go dead in Washington. [Too many calls at once.] The assassins flee Dallas separately. Oswald asks for legal assistance. On Sunday Jack Ruby goes to the police station. Oswald is shot! ""He was the killer."" There are photographs of the 18 material witnesses who died in the next three years. The odd against this randomly happening are exceedingly high.

While an assassination could be the work of a ""lone gunman"" (as `TIME' said about Lincoln's assassination), the killing of Oswald two days later suggests a conspiracy to many people. ""The Assassination Tapes"" book used a voice-stress analyzer to measure the recorded conversations and found that Oswald spoke the truth (or was insane). The removal of JFK resulted in only one change in policy. Executive Order 11,110 was reversed. This ordered the US Treasury to print $100 bills instead of using the more expensive Federal Reserve Notes. The US government has to pay the Fed for its own money!

Why is Oswald ""not guilty""? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.

Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book ""The Assassination Tapes"" explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the ""lone gunman"" theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book ""Dr. Feelgood"" explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?",1502236800,,4958,4.917562724014337
