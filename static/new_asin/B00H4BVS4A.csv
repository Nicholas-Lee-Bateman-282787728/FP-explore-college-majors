6131707,4,B00H4BVS4A,"Dr. Simon Lowell ( Corin Nemec) is working on the K.R.O.N.O.S. project designed to stop volcanic eruptions and harness the energy on top of that. He has a barbie doll daughter (Mia Faith) who disapproves of his barbie doll near girlfriend (Victoria Pratt). He also has a barbie doll assistant (Sophie Tilson) who unfortunately gets eaten by a dragon early in the film. As a volcano erupts, dragon cocoons emerge and kill people. It seems this always happens, but has just become a problem here of late. Dr. Lowell is blamed for everything, then in the formulaic twist is called on the save the world forcing his daughter to bond with his wannabe girl friend. WOW! Didn't see that coming!

There is a cute subplot that never really intersects the main plot involving a high beam reporter assistant (Dominika Juillet) attempting to crack the story of the top secret dragons.

The film is not great by any means. It appears the blondes all failed out of the same drama club. The dragons are mostly in the sky, with a few close-ups. The dialogue is at times light, which was a plus, but it wasn't well delivered. The plot was full of holes. Mia Faith managed to get across a few good moody teen scenes, although there were other scenes she bombed.

Rates 4 stars on the cheese scale. Suitable for Asylum fans. No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. $9.96 Walmart.",1396310400,3,1348,4.631799163179917

8629807,5,B00H4BVS4A,"I think this is one of the cleverest monster movies ever. The actors play it straight but it is intended to be quite humorous. The daughter is fantastic. I did not quite get the purpose of the backstory with the reporters, but I enjoyed the entire concept and the way it was produced. It is funny and entertaining and always boosts my spirits to watch.",1524614400,,352,4.430769230769231

8629811,4,B00H4BVS4A,"This movie is kind of hard to find and I ended up paying around $10 , but I was satisfied with my purchase. Corin Nemec is stellar as always and the actress playing his daughter was mad hot! The fire dragons made occasional appearances, but looked really good when they were on screen. 4 out of 5 stars.",1453248000,,303,4.241379310344827

8629814,4,B00H4BVS4A,"I have a particular fondness for crappy movies with questionable artistic merit.  This film was done on the cheap and it shows.  The story involves shortcut plot points that are high on drama and low on sense.  A goofy scientist (Corin Nemec) is instantly framed and blamed and fired for supposedly setting off an eruption on Mt. Baker.  He's vilified in the news by an over-the-hill reporter.  The army wants to contain him and his whiny daughter plus a colleague/suitable girlfriend (Victoria Pratt).  They have to flee for their safety but are quickly captured by the army who now want his help/expertise (sorry we got you fired and killed your career but we have this dragon problem...........).  Apparently, Mount St. Helens didn't erupt it was nuked.  And Area 51 was set up for the dragon problem, not aliens.  This is supposed to be a conspiracy aficionado's dream come true.  But it's not.
Yes, this is a dopey movie.  Yes, the dialog is silly at all times.  Yes, the premise is unbelievably daft.  No, it was not shot in the Pacific Northwest; look at the lack of foliage in the exterior scenes!  The FX is cartoony.  The acting varies (at least Corin Nemec appears to be having fun throughout).  There are not enough dragons, not enough mayhem.  This is a crappy movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It goes in the collection to watch again.  (I'd like to say they don't make movies like this anymore but they do, with alarming regularity.  You have to get them while you can.)
This is for people who love bad movies, everyone else should avoid it at all cost.........and considering the price.......!",1400976000,9,1609,4.736462093862816

8629816,3,B00H4BVS4A,This was a different idea on what is really going on inside an active volcano. Would have made B movie status if it were in B&W.,1398124800,,128,3.9615384615384617
