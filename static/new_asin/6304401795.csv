7869692,3,6304401795,This movie was written along the lines of another movie that I can remember the name but it is ok for mundane entertainment,1374278400,,123,4.391304347826087
7869693,5,6304401795,"I hadn't heard of this movie but thought I'd seen everything Travolta had done over the years. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing, acting and directing in this movie.  It's old enough that you might happen upon it on a premium movie channel or OnDemand cable, and if you do, give it a watch. I would have paid to see it at a theater but I'm glad I happened across it on Amazon.com instead.",1247184000,2,416,4.265822784810126
7869694,3,6304401795,"I brought this movie strickly on impulse from my work. It cost me $2.99, brand new (dvd). I'd never seen it before, but was very impressed. I know it is a TV movie, but nonetheless, it is very watchable. I can watch it several more times, in fact. After watching movies like these, you gain respect for independent films.
There are bad reviews for this movie out there, but I say hire it out and make up your own mind. A Travolta classic!",1085529600,,438,4.289156626506024
7869695,2,6304401795,"Chains of Gold is one of those movies John Travolta did during his career slump.  This one has Travolta as Scott Barnes, a social worker who rescues a kid from a drug-running street gang.  Hector Elizondo has a part as Lieutenant Ortega.  Silly plot certainly doesn't help this forgettable action movie. Director Rob Holcomb moved on to direct the excellent TV movie 'Finding the Way Home'.",985046400,,390,4.878787878787879
