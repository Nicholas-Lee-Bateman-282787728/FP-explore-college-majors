4959213,4,B006512BFU,"WARNING:  While not explicit, per se...this review does touch on some subject matter some folks might simply not want to read about.  I don't mean to offend anyone, but there's no way to review the movie otherwise, in my opinion.

SHAME has been called the ""movie about the sex addict"" and this is a rather unfair over-simplification.  It also implies that there might be lots of juicy sex scenes, especially given its NC-17 rating.  If THIS is what you're expecting, you are in for a disappointment.

Director Steve McQueen's film is a character study of one very specific sex addict, Brandon (Michael Fassbender).  And I'm not even sure if Brandon is a sex addict or something different.  He is certainly a man driven to spending virtually all his spare time (and much of his time at work) viewing porn and pleasuring himself.  He spends lots of money on prostitutes.  He is also attractive enough to draw yearning from women looking for a good time and a quickie in an alley (literally at one point).  But NONE of these activities give him any pleasure whatsoever.  In fact, he seems to suffer a psychic pain at his despair in not truly drawing any pleasure from his compulsions.  I read one review in which the viewer describes him as a ""monster.""  I felt much the opposite...he is a creature to be pitied.  Having said that, I felt pity mostly because we saw everything from Brandon's perspective.  Not much attention is paid to the damage he may be causing others (with one key exception, which I'll discuss below)...therefore, we see HIS torment and HIS unhappiness and HIS damage.  It's hard not to feel sorry for him, even as we're repulsed by his activities.  This is a smart guy who knows better...but his self-knowledge only makes him hate himself more...it does not curtail his destructive activities.

Brandon's specific damage is linked to the damage his sister carries (Carey Mulligan).  She, too, is looking for love and is deeply unhappy.  When she moves, unasked, into Brandon's spartan NYC apartment, she is an interloper on his privacy, but more importantly, she reignites unhealthy feelings each shares for the other.  They are very open with each other about their bodies (there is a long scene where the two have a heated exchange which she stands naked in the shower, and makes no effort to cover).  They give each other longing looks.  They've clearly both been damaged by events in their childhoods, and this has created a strong but very unhealthy bond between the two.  Brandon senses it more than she, but his efforts to push her away are damaging to both of them.

SHAME is a well-crafted film.  There are many interesting shots.  In one, Brandon is running down an avenue, and the camera tracks him for several blocks, in one long take.  In another scene, Brandon and a co-worker are on a first date at a restaurant, and one long shot captures the first several minutes of the date...from amusing encounters with the waiter to telling moments of conversation.  It's a fascinating and engaging scene that a viewer will either find riveting (because so many little moments are so telling) or dull as can be (because they talk about so little and the camera is so still).  And there's another scene in which Brandon's sister sings a VERY slow version of ""New York, New York"" in a nightclub, while Brandon listens.  The torment they each express is gripping, and with almost no words (beyond the lyrics of the song) we learn an awful lot about their relationship.

Mulligan is outstanding in her role, and she should be in the Oscar conversation.  She exposes herself physically in unflattering ways, but is heartbreaking as well.  Fassbender is riveting as well.  His performance is daring in that he has totally committed to this pitiable, unlikeable role in such a way that after just over ninety minutes, we feel we know Brandon about as well as we have ever known a movie character.  We don't know the facts of his past, or quite what he does for a living.  But we know his pain.  We see how his mind works.  Yes, there's also full frontal...but that seems less brave than the anguish he puts himself through.

The sex in the film is actually not a whole lot more explicit than what you'd see in an R-rated movie.  It's the casual nudity in other scenes that got the NC-17 rating.  But none of it is titillating or erotic.  This is a movie that shows sex is not only NOT a substitute for meaningful human contact but can actually destroy goodness, ambition, empathy and humanity.  Sobering stuff.

SHAME is a well-made film, extremely well acted, that will absolutely turn off most viewers.  This is not to say that someone only ""sophisticated"" viewers or ""daring"" viewers will like it.  I admired it greatly, but didn't enjoy it.  It shows ugly, unpleasant things happening...even if you aren't bored by the slow pace, you might be greatly put-off by the subject matter or the view of humanity it posits.  I'd say ""see it,"" but if you hate it...don't blame me for wasting your time.  I've probably not seen a film that is more of a ""viewer beware...you may both LOVE and HATE this film at the same time"" since BLUE VELVET.",1327276800,220,5156,4.705027932960894
4959214,3,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" has been billed as an ""addiction drama,"" the addiction in this case being a sexual addiction. When I saw this film in the theatre, there was a vibe about the audience ... many of the people in the theatre were clearly planning on being titillated, shocked, or turned on by the film. Those people were probably disappointed since, despite plenty of nudity and sexual situations, there was absolutely nothing sexy about this film. Every time Brandon (the central character and sexual addict, bravely and hauntingly portrayed by Michael Fassbender) acts out, it's an act of desperation and a way of numbing the intense pain and alienation that is written all over his face.

""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place,"" says Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, to her brother in one of the many desperate voicemail messages she leaves him throughout the film. The film's ""elephant in the room,"" which is never spelled out explicitly but is obvious throughout every single scene, is that Brandon and Sissy were both sexually abused as children, probably by their parents. As adults, they are both hopelessly damaged. Brandon seeks constant, compulsive sexual gratification but is completely unable to have an authentic, genuine interaction with another human being. Sissy also acts out sexually, but, unlike Brandon, clings desperately and inappropriately to those around her, as well as self-harms (by cutting).

It's hard to give this film a ""grade."" Why? Because it's not a film that is enjoyable to watch on any level. Practically every scene is painful ... you're spending two hours watching two tortured, ruined human beings self-destructing. But at the same time, the film is beautifully shot and directed, and the two lead performances are outstanding. And the film succeeds on a basic level, by showing how childhood sexual abuse can destroy its victims.",1327276800,90,1883,5.130293159609121
4959215,4,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" (101 min.) has become notorious for its subject matter and for its franks portrayal of that subject matter. Michael Fassbender stars as the sex addict who, despite his many partners, is unable to build a meaningful relationship. Michael's world is turned upside down by the unexpected visit from his sister Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan, who has nowhere else to stay and basically movies in, uninvited, in her brother's apartment. As the Fassbender character readjusts his life reluctantly, the one thing that sticks out is the utter loneliness of this man. Even when his sister begs him to open up a bit, he cannot.

As the movie carries on, the storyline becomes somewhat preditable (reason for my overall rating of 3.5 stars), including the very obvious ending of the movie, but by then you simply marvel at the acting performances given by the lead actors. Fassbender has simpluy had a break-out year in 2011 with X-Men: First Class, A Dangerous Method, and now this (and already another movie ""Haywire"" out in the theatres). But for me the performance by Carey Mulligan was the true eye-opener, at a level only hinted at in her break-out movie ""An Education"" 2 years ago. She will be a screen talent for many more years to enjoy.

One final note about the movie: director Steve McQueen frequently during the movie has the good sense of letting a scene unfold without having to change the camera angle or doing other unnecessary edits. Instead things just happen and we get to witness it. This may be challenging for some viewers in today's short-attention span society, but for me this is a welcome restraint of the dizzying ediiting that so many directors seem to insist on.",1327190400,,1690,4.844290657439446
4959216,1,B006512BFU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 1.5

I'm still trying to figure out why this film has received so many accolades from the media. Perhaps it's director Steve McQueen's visceral style and the performer's intense performances. But none of this can make up for the vapid, manipulative screenplay, featuring characters we learn next to nothing about.

McQueen's protagonist is 'Brandon', a sex addict who appears to be angry at the world for largely unknown reasons. The one thing that Brandon is clearly resentful about, is having to put his co-dependent sister, Sissy, up in his apartment. Sissy alludes to the fact that they were both abused as children but we never learn any significant details about the abuse. Sissy turns out to be a wholly unsympathetic character, a freeloader who expects her brother to take care of her.

We end up getting a brief peek at Brandon's work world when we're introduced to his obnoxious boss, David, who flatters every woman he meets, and gets nowhere. In contrast, bad boy Brandon acts disinterested with the same women David tries to score with, and becomes an instant babe magnet. The best loser David can do is bed Sissy at Brandon's apartment, with the angry brother, seething, as he's forced to listen to the sounds of their lovemaking inside the bedroom.

McQueen has an annoying habit of holding shots for too long. There's a wholly unnecessary scene where we see Brandon urinating in the bathroom from a distance. Ditto when Sissy sings an awfully slow rendition of 'New York, New York' during her gig as a lounge singer.

Eventually, Brandon has a 'normal' date with Nicole but admits to her over dinner that the longest relationship he's ever had was four months. When he attempts to have sex with her, this time he's a complete flop, as he's unable to cope with the intimacy of a more genuine encounter.

By now, we realize that Writer/Director McQueen has no additional aces to play. Brandon is hardly someone we can care about because McQueen doesn't know how to develop his characters. Yes, we 'get it' early on that Brandon is an emotionally stunted, cut-off individual who uses sex do dull his inner turmoil, just like any addict. After watching one mechanical sex scene after another, culminating in Brandon's particularly dull encounter at a gay sex club (which is supposed to represent the apotheosis of his desperate fixation), our sympathy for this loser of a protagonist, has reached its lowest nadir.

Now McQueen aims to redeem Brandon through a decided, manipulative, sleight of hand. The police action in the subway station which Brandon is about to disembark at, leads one to believe that someone has jumped on to the tracks. Could it be sister Sissy? Brandon runs out of the station and up to his apartment, only to find that Sissy has opted for a much more conventional attempt at suicide--she's a bloody mess after slitting her wrists. It's taken the shock of almost losing his sister, to wake Brandon up. At film's end, director McQueen implies that Brandon will no longer be cruising the streets for his next pick up.

Take away all the slick cinematography and one is left with the standard melodrama of a sad sack who can't stand himself and hates the world. McQueen, and other uninspired film makers like him, believes this is enough for character development. But for those who appreciate the craft of screen writing, only fully realized, BELIEVABLE and sympathetic characters, should populate the pages of a screenplay, the particular type, that truly deserves all the honors bestowed upon it.",1327104000,20,3583,4.909090909090909
4959217,4,B006512BFU,"In this lurid tale of sexual addiction, director and co-writer Steve McQueen teams up again with Michael Fassbender (""Hunger"").  Brandon (Fassbender) is a moderately successful sales manager that outwardly appears to be just a regular single guy in Manhattan.  Behind closed doors (or open windows) he can't get enough sex.  If he can't get it by picking up girls, he will resort to prostitutes or internet porn.  If that's inconvenient, then there's the old fashion do it yourself method.  He has no interest in relationships.  In the one tryst he has with a co-worker who wants something beyond sex, Brandon can't pull the trigger.  There's something clearly wrong with this guy.

His life becomes complicated when his sister (Carey Mulligan in another terrific performance) shows up at his apartment uninvited.  Their initial encounter when he walks in on her in the shower alerts us that something is amiss.  He has an unusually long conversation with her as she stands before him in all her full frontal glory.  Hmm.  The siblings couldn't be more different.  Brandon is almost a recluse.  He socializes but only if there is a chance for sex.  Sissy (Mulligan) is talkative, effervescent and looking for fun. She is a troubled soul however.

We see this initially when Brandon and his boss (James Badge Dale, TV's ""Rubicon"") go to a club where Sissy has a gig singing.  In a featured scene she sings a sorrowful rendition of  ""New York, New York"" that brings a tear to Brandon...and me.  In another scene, Sissy cuddles up to Brandon in the middle of the night.  He rightfully throws her out but why would she do that?  In another scene, she says to him ""we are not bad people; we just come from a bad place.""  Certainly a history of incest is suggested as the cause of their psychological damage.  Unfortunately, McQueen does little to flesh out this cause and effect background.

The film is graphically presented in terms of language, nudity and sexual activity earning the NC-17 rating.  The performances by Fassbender and Mulligan are special and worthy of awards.  Many people will have trouble watching this film for a variety of reasons.  Once will do for the performances of the leads.",1325376000,24,2199,4.857142857142857
4959218,5,B006512BFU,"Directed by Steve McQueen, ""Shame"" explores sexual addiction, alienation, and loneliness in contemporary New York City. With its many sex scenes, the film manages to be unerotic. The movie and its actors have received numerous accolades.  The acting is convincing and the scenes of city life well drawn. Many viewers will find this film disturbing.

The film stars Michael Fassbender as a successful 30ish professional named Brandon who cannot control his sexual appetites or channel his sexuality into a relationship. Brandon is both a predator and a victim. He is apparently able to pick up attractive similarly lonely women on the spot for short encounters. Brandon also uses the services of prostitutes.  When he is home alone, he watches pornography and camgirls on his computer. He gets confronted with a wide range of pornographic material on his office computer. He is unable to function in an attempted relationship with a coworker, Marianne, (Nichole Beharie) which involves attempted emotion beyond sex. Fassbender plays this role well in his lines, dress, gestures, and facial expressions. He has a sense of decency and is at war with himself.

The other primary character in ""Shame"" is Brandon's younger sister Sissie played by Carrie Mulligan. Sissie has suicidal tendencies and is emotionally needy. She moves in with Brandon early in the film and the emotional tension mounts between the siblings as the movie progresses. Each sees the serious, devastating issues in the life of the other. Brandon's sexual addition and his relationship with Sissie become intertwined and form the two themes of this movie.

The movie makes have use of atmosphere to establish the sordid character of Brandon's mind. There are many scenes of crowded subways which capture the lonely, solitary character of much urban life.  There are pick-up scenes in bars, from the fancy to the seedy, which stress lack of emotional connection. The movie shows several scenes of paid sex between Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties. The musical score is ominous and brooding, punctuated by Glenn Gould playing Bach and by various pop songs. Sissie is trying to make it as a singer and, in a pivotal scene of the movie, offers a rendition of ""New York New York"" in the company of Brandon and his boss.

The movie includes substantial nudity, male and female. To their credit, the producers declined to soften the movie to receive an ""R"" rather than a ""NC-17"" rating. The movie offers an effective portrayal of how sex can become a narcotic to deal with loneliness in a harsh world.

4959219,5,B006512BFU,"A deeply moving film filled with philosophical and psychological insight by the great Steve McQueen. (Not the white actor with the motorcycle who is dead, but rather the black director who is alive and makes amazing films...Hunger...12 Years a Slave...). All the performances are outstanding, but Fassbender is a revelation. Some of his scenes remind me of the greatest scenes of silent cinema...no words, the face says everything.

Many reviews describe this film as being about sex addiction, but this is very reductive. The sex addiction is simply a powerful frame for exploring the ways and extents to which people are capable or incapable of connection and intimacy, what they can and cannot give each other and the tension between emotional duty and freedom.",1517875200,,764,5.161290322580645

I watched because I wanted to like her and I kept waiting for her performance to get better. I never did.  She had me so frustrated, I cheered when Michael's character told her what a trap she was. This is coming from an independent, female, who just wished the sister could've taken care of herself and respected her brother's personal life, screwed up as it was. It was still his. ""Helpless"" people who always need you to stop what you're doing and look after them, are the most manipulating people on the planet. If nothing else, this movie showed that very well.

It makes one wonder what happened to these two during their childhood to make them into these fragile and very flawed adults.  There were some graphic scenes in this movie.

Many jokes are made about people who are addicted to sex but this movie paints a painful picture.  Michael Fassbender's character, for all of his hook-ups, was not a happy person.

4959314,5,B006512BFU,"Shame deserves no less than 5 stars, simply for Michael Fassbender's compelling performance as a sexually addicted businessman being consumed by his own masochistic drives and fear of intimacy. In short, Brandon is an established 30-something New Yorker with a suave apartment and a high stakes job. But underneath his normal exterior, Brandon struggles with sex addiction. When his volatile little sister, Sissy, comes to stay with him, Brandon's self-control unravels as his addiction is discovered and his shame increases.

If you're a fan of clear cut storylines, you might dislike 'Shame'. You won't find an 'a-ha!' moment that explains Brandon's addiction. Do we even need one? It's self-explanatory. Brandon and Sissy are masochists -- Brandon abuses himself by constantly engaging in risky sex acts, and Sissy self-harms and dates emotionally abusive men. Sissy's voicemail speaks volumes about their abusive childhood: 'We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place'. This film is simply an artistic character study about damaged people who hurt others by hurting themselves; we don't need all the details. This concept is something many of us relate to, which makes the film powerful.

Like a classic abuse victim, Brandon remains detached by engaging in sex acts that are anything but erotic, despite the NC-17 rating. The alienating cinematography and tense score during the sex scenes are meant to make the viewer feel strange if they derive pleasure from watching Brandon have sex; I believe Steve McQueen did this purposefully in order to force the viewer to understand Brandon's own sense of shame and confusion about his desires.

Fassbender does an outstanding job of portraying just how miserable sex really makes a sex addict. Fassbender's strength is using body language, facial expressions and speech to give depth and realism to his characters, and he excels at making Brandon come alive. During the film, Brandon hires prostitutes, masturbates at work and gets caught with porn on his work laptop. Clearly, he has an addiction, and things get even worse when Sissy discovers it. By the film's ending, Brandon's shame about his compulsive desires amplify his masochism. He goes on a sex binge to punish himself for being cruel to Sissy -- each of his encounters ends up leaving him increasingly pained, ashamed and broken (as well as physically beaten). Throughout, Fassbender creates a sense of building tension and self-disgust that bursts in our faces at the film's climax.

'Shame' is not an easy film to watch -- it makes you stare into the faces of self-destruction and addiction. However, the acting is brilliant. The cinematography works to convey the movie's theme, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend watching 'Shame' for Michael Fassbender's excellence alone.",1473120000,6,2804,5.224444444444444

4959319,5,B006512BFU,"Incredible acting.  Delicate subject matter.  Sex addict brother and suicidal, borderline sister.  I have a friend who was (and is now a recovering) sex addict, and it was excruciating for him to live with the problem.  He could not control the addiction--it controlled him--and like Michael Fassbender's character in Shame, his entire life fell apart over time--job, family, everything--until he asked for help and received inpatient treatment at a famous (and fabulous) clinic in Arizona.
Michael Fassbender somehow makes you care about him, even though his addiction is in many ways unbelievable to most people and difficult to watch.  And Carey Mulligan as his suicidal sister is brilliant in her portrayal of a talented singer who has so many of her own insecurities that she seeks out her brother for support, only to find that he's unable to support or help her due to the overwhelming nature of the sex addiction that is overtaking his life.  Although he cares about her, he's simply unable to help anyone--not even himself.",1472428800,4,1032,5.076923076923077

4959322,4,B006512BFU,"Not much happens in SHAME. Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a successful thirtysomething in contemporary New York, has a series of brief flings with both men and women and ends up dissatisfied as a result. His sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) pursues an equally hedonistic life and tries to commit suicide.

The point about Steve McQueen's film is that there is no point. Brandon remains pathologically unable to engage with anyone; he knows his own shortcomings and tries to compensate for them through visceral means - watching endless porn videos, masturbating in the bathroom, paying for soulless sex with a series of whores. The ""shame"" of the title refers to his gradual understanding of his own inadequacies, and his inability to deal with them. There are shameful moments - such as when Sissy discovers him masturbating - but they are nothing compared to Brandon's overall sense of shame.

The film gains much of its power from the contrast between the opulent New York settings - Brandon's well-appointed office, and his equally classy apartment with its stunning views over the Hudson River - and the squalid existence he pursues in seedy bars and ill- lit clubs. The degenerate nature of his life is summed up in one sequence taking place in a darkened pool hall, where he tries to pick up someone else's girlfriend by offering her instant sexual gratification. The result, inevitably, is that Brandon is given a good hiding by the jealous boyfriend.

Yet perhaps Brandon actively seeks after such retributive treatment; unable to achieve any form of fulfillment, he harbors a masochistic desire to be punished. The film's end is strongly reminiscent of the beginning, with Brandon sitting alone on a subway train ogling unknown women. Nothing, it seems, can distract him from his path towards destruction.

Director Steve McQueen's handling of the material is highly sexually explicit yet un-erotic. The screen sex is mechanical, devoid of any passion, despite the participants' attempts to spice it up with a few well-timed moans of pleasure. What is perhaps more memorable is the sight of Brandon's and Sissy's expressionless faces as they either walk through New York's unfriendly streets or try to forge an existence together in Brandon's apartment.

Years ago Martin Scorsese painted a bleak picture of New York and its endemic violence in TAXI DRIVER (1976). SHAME offers an equally pessimistic interpretation; the city might have spruced itself up architecturally, and more money might be made in the bourgeois Manhattan streets; but the inhabitants are equally alienated from their environment.",1471996800,,2608,5.214797136038186

There are not a lot of main characters in this movie except Brandon and his sister.  The other actors encompass the supporting storyline.

Fassbender communicates his pain through emotion more than dialogue in this movie.  i don't know if NC-17 was necessary, but that is just my opinion.  I'm glad Steve McQueen, whom I mistook as the actor turned director (what a second, he died in the 70s.) is making these important movies and showing consequences of addiction as a whole both mentally, physically, and emotionally.)

They both feel strangely comfortable being naked around one another and sissy tries to cuddle with her brother in his bed right after she's had sex with his boss.  Brandon explodes at her and kicks her out.  She tells him later that he's always angry with her and she doesn't know why.  I had a suspicion that perhaps they were both sexually abused as children- perhaps abused well into puberty while both were in the same room since sissy's womanly body doesn't phase Brandon one bit when he walks in on her naked.  But their weird ways are never delved into and instead the rest of the movie is only a series of sex scenes that tell us what we already know-  Brandon has a severe problem.  But we already knew that so we don't need scene after scene after scene of this slow movie telling it to us repeatedly.

Things become worse when her sister moves into his apartment without warning and memories of their painful childhood are brought back.

This is definitely a no-holds barred look at a sexual addict. We get to see his personality and the sufferings that he undergoes due to his constant desire for sex. While many viewers would probably see this expecting many sexy bed scenes and numerous naked scenes from the cast involved,too bad that this movie is far from being sexy as it focuses more on the characteristics of a sexual addict.

He is brown sugar tempted by intimacy, but cannot commit. He is devilishly sexy (""I wanna taste you, make you cum."" She says ""Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah?""), but punch drunk and on the run. Yet when his sister (Cary Mulligan) comes to stay on his couch, his routine disrupted, we see he is only as sick as his secrets. An adult film, ""Shame"" is not for the Suburban minded.

The file you download, if you're even able to download it, won't open, and if you check the Google Play shop, ""Shame"" is no longer for sale or rental in mid-2015. Fox Connect will not help you with downloading it, they deny that you're even able to use the download app.

As for the film, if you know anything about its content, then you know why you're buying it. Yes, the acting can be called amazing, the director followed this with ""12 Years A Slave,"" and the story about two very damaged siblings feels super intense.

4959563,1,B006512BFU,"Is this what they call an Indie film? I bought it because I had heard so much about it and I had never seen Michael Fassbender yet. Well I was terribly disappointed in the film. It is one of the slowest moving films I'de ever seen in my whole life. And that is an understatement.  Maybe I just didn't get the point of the whole damn thing.  The adds for the film read, 'brilliant', 'relentless', 'memerizing' or 'riveting' or some other thing to sell the movie. If I was just watching the damn thing on cable I would have channeled surf to another movie or program, but since I bought the damn thing I watched the whole thing. In a sence it was 'soft porn'. At least to me. It was not a 'story' as much as a film about a man with a sex addiction problem. The film had no beginning nor an end really.  The sex scenes well why didn't they just go ahead and show us some good complete porn instead of tentillating us with all that B.S. Ha Ha Ha  And the language is filthy out of Michael Fassbender's mouth. Oh, you may call this a movie script's fault. Give me a break. Please don't insult my intelligence and call this an 'artsy' film on a delicate subject as sex addiction. An actor will say anything today if it's in the 'script' or what the director says won't he.  Michael Fassbender may be a very good actor but in my humble opinion he has ruined his reputation in doing this piece of s***. Shame is right. He should or will be ashamed he ever made this piece of filth. I am a fairly intelligent man with a fairly good open mind, but this film(if you want to callit that) pushed my limits. I have known a couple of men and a gal too who had this problem. They went to a 12 Step addictions program. Why didn't they end this film with this Brandon character getting some help instead of the sad pathetic way it ended? I would be ashamed to watch it in most company. I would give it away to one of my friends but I'de be ashamed for them to know I even owned it. I'de be interested to know if this thing was a hit or not. It is a film for very few. If I had paid to see this thing in a theater I would have asked to have my money back. This was certainly not a 'feel good movie. But then again my formative years were of happier films and really great stories and musicals. And I'm sorry if I gave the impression that I don't like Michael Fassbender. I'm sure he's a great actor and a fine human being. I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. Maybe ""Fish Tank"" or ""Jane Eyre""!

4959584,5,B006512BFU,"I love the movie because it never shows what the characters' shared childhood is like, but it's made clear that they've gone through childhood abuse. The movie clearly shows how many people are shaped by childhood abuse. It also shows that Sissy and Brandon are chasing after the same thing, but doing it in very different ways. Sissy is  is needy and has zero boundaries because she's desperate for a meaningful connection. Brandon wants meaningful connections, but he doesn't know how to define his himself outside of sex.

I also love the film because it shows what sexual addiction looks like. There's this idea that sex addiction either doesn't exist, or is fun. This movie shows that, like all addictions, it's not fun. It might start out as fun, but it can quickly becomes, ""I have to do this"" or ""I need to do this.""",1420416000,2,824,4.675862068965517

Movie can slow down at times but kept my attention. If you don't like in your face sex scenes and full nudity (male and female) don't watch. Honestly speaking the nudity and scenes are part of the story and didn't seem to be thrown in for the sake of having sex scenes.

I kept waiting for the part of the movie that was so riveting I wouldn't be able to take my eyes off of it.  Sadly, that moment never came.  This movie was so bad that even the sex scenes were painful to watch.  There was no character development, no plot build up... just sad, boring, and dark day in the life type footage of an uninteresting man. The characters hint at a rough background in their early years, but the movie doesn't go deeper then a hint.  Maybe if they explored this viewers would feel something for this guy and his sister.

4959829,3,B006512BFU,"If ever there was a missed opportunity for greatness, it is this film. Addiction is covered in so many different ways in so many different films that I have seen, but I cannot remember ever seeing a film about sex addiction, which is so crippling.

The film begins with an expedition into the drab, white wall, plain furniture, corporate world of Brandon, played by the talented Fassbender. (Side note- Fassbender should have received an Oscar nod, he is the destructive heart and soul of this film and performs so well, he is simply amazing). Brandon appears to be a man that has it all, sex, money, work and a few buddies that he goes out with. Of course what makes 'Shame' such an interesting film is that McQueen does not want the audience to feel sympathy for Brandon, but feel nothing. The entire point of the film happens behind close doors, this is where the shame lies. Brandon appears completely control of everything around him, but it is in the dark corners, crummy bars and swanky hotels that that we find Brandon always drawn too because for some reason (a reason that is never fully explained only hinted at and therefore very frustrating for the audience) Brandon cannot make a human connection to save his life.

The level of depravity showcased in this film is expected for someone who has an addiction to sex. I found that those scenes fully represented the need for sex just as other films represent the need for alcohol or drugs. Sex is nothing to Brandon, it is showcased as something he does and checks off his list. The interaction between his sister, Sissy, played with passion by Mulligan, is perhaps the sickest element of the film. Again, their lives growing up and what happened to them somehow fits into the film but never materializes which would have elevated the film to a different level. It is very difficult to feel empathy for someone's malfunction if you do not know the foundation. But, then again I think that was the point of the film- that sometimes there is no clear cut answer as to why people are the way they are, sometimes there is no excuse to hide behind.

This film is not for everyone. I would not recommend it either because it is difficult to watch and even harder to get out of your head after-wards and quite depressing. Brandon is that emotionless, bottomless pit of darkness that only experiences slivers of light. The ending posses the ultimate question : when does what we do in secret destroy us?",1399420800,,2456,4.641379310344828

4959832,5,B006512BFU,"first, this is a very difficult film to watch, in the same way mcqueen's subsequent ""12 years a slave"" is difficult to watch. in both films we see human beings struggling against oppression and torture. here the scars of self cutting replace the welts of a whipping, but the oppressive atmosphere of exploitation and amorality is the same.

for the brother and sister in ""shame"" this oppression arises somewhere in their shared past -- hinted at in their inappropriate mutual nudity and the story brandon (fassbender) tells of being knocked unconscious by his brother. mother and father are never mentioned, brandon's apartment is bare of any mementos, and his sister's arms are tracked with self mutilation, subtle details that convey the cavernous hole of denial and pain that binds them both. the result is that both fail at intimacy, the sister with her boyfriends and brother, and the brother with his sister and a lovely and eager coworker.

in the same way that the proud and free man in ""12 years"" becomes very adept at being a slave simply in order to survive, the siblings here turn their emotional bondage into artful song or enthusiastic pursuit of conquest: they have learned how to be good slaves. the most remarkable aspect of this film is that it shows humans can adapt to and manipulate their self imposed bondage in the same way that plantation slaves become clever at avoiding a whipping. the fact that brandon's callow and pathetic boss is a casual adulterer and uses his workplace power over brandon for personal ends, including the seduction of brandon's sister in brandon's apartment while brandon is in the next room, or that married women are willing to flirt with brandon in public, illustrates that self imposed enslavement will elect its own masters and whip hands to keep an inner bondage firmly in place.

why sex, pornography, nudity as the specific expression of emotional bondage? why not alcoholism, or gambling, or violence? i'd guess, partly because we've had already a long line of profane and corrupt cops, criminals, loners and losers, so that modern cinema has inured us to these deviances and made their vices seem almost picaresque. i suspect mcqueen chose sexual addiction and emotional dependency because these are inherently ugly and demeaning, difficult to watch and clearly brutalizing and dehumanizing to the protagonists. it's a fine directorial touch that the soundtrack includes some of the more bizarre misinterpretations of j.s. bach's keyboard music recorded by glenn gould, the master of oppressively sterile bach pianism.

the film culminates in an episode where brandon's hostility toward his sister dissolves in the panicked realization that he cares for her, and his sobbing collapse on a lonely wharf releases, in me at least, a surge of empathy and compassion for his predicament. and the film closes as it opened, with a married woman blatantly offering herself to brandon on a subway train -- but this time brandon does not eye her with the amused hunger of a predator, but with the wary stare of a man resolved to be free.",1398988800,5,3086,4.9864077669902915

4959836,1,B006512BFU,"Everything about this movie is exploitive, pointless garbage pretending to be art. The title has no meaning. I have no idea who is ashamed or what shame has to do with anything. The film is about a brother and sister. The sister desperately needs her older brother in her life. He can't bear to have her in it - why we never find out. We do learn that she has a history of cutting herself on the arms. And we learn that the brother doesn't want her to stay with him in his apartment because it impinges on his desire to have hookers visit him and to view Internet porn and the like. However, she's a free spirit. She wouldn't care if he had 3 hookers visit every day. She's happy to let men pick her up and have sex in a window everybody from blocks around can watch. But the brother doesn't want his sister to know he likes porn. Now...why would that be? Internet porn is a huge industry around the world. Why hide it from a sister who doesn't mind her brother seeing her stark naked in the shower?

I could go on, but the thing is, this picture stinks. It makes absolutely no sense. What it's about is showing very long shots, close-ups, of genitals in the act of sex. You'll see exactly how long Michael Fassbender's penis is, unless it was enhanced by CGI. Some people think Fassbender can act. I don't. But Carey Mulligan is the best young actress working today, and what she's doing in this garbage being thrust into from behind while naked from the front with her breasts flying around is beyond me.

The film was written and directed by the no-talent Steve McQueen, who did such a horrendous self-conscious job with 12 Years A Slave. His endless, locked-off shots are so long that Fassbender can begin to masturbate in the shower, you can go masturbate in your shower, and when you come back, Fassbender will still be masturbating in the shower on the same shot. Remember the choral scene in 12 Years A Slave? It began with a very long shot of a female slave just staring. For a long time. Then she began to sing. Very self-conscious and stagey, not filmic at all. Well, at the end of Shame, there's an equally ridiculous shot, very long, with a dramatic action at the end by Fassbender. What the point of it isn't clear. Is he upset about his sister? That he's a bad brother? Who cares? As I said, it's just pornography. There's no story. It's just about filming sex. This is what used to be called a dirty movie.",1398124800,15,2422,4.38

4959847,3,B006512BFU,"I am on the fence about this film. On one hand, the storyline is very strange and some of the sex scenes are very graphic. On the other hand, the story makes sense if you understand that Michael Fassbender obviously comes from a crazy and totally dysfunctional family and really has no one that he can confide in. Even his sister, played by Carey Mulligan, is nuts and it's alluded to that the two of them may not have had a normal brother-sister relationship. In fact, it's pretty clear to me that the two of them  had an incestuous relationship when they were younger but that is not stated in the film. And when Fassbender tries to venture out of his comfort zone to establish a normal boyfriend-girlfriend relationship with one of his coworkers, he finds that he cannot perform in the bedroom and, feeling helpless and demoralized, resorts to his past behavior of one-night stands, drugs, and unprotected and wild sex.

As an actor, Fassbender does an exceptional job with the main character. His personality is withdrawn, introverted, and in a constant state of inner pain. It's very difficult for him to show true emotion but when he does the transition is amazing. I just wish the movie had provided more background information as to what happened to Fassbender's character when we was younger to make him engage in such destructive behavior because that might have enabled me to appreciate the story more. As it was, I understood why Fassbender did what he did, but it was still very awkward to see it play out on film. It was if I were watching the inner workings of someone's very messed up private life when they really didn't want anyone to know what was going on. But maybe that was the intention of the director.

4959858,2,B006512BFU,"Its a shame that Shame only deserves a two star rating, since there are many four to five star elements in the film.  The photography is exquisite in virtually all scenes.  The use of color to set mood is masterful; from Brandons cold soulless apartment to the warmth of the bar where Sissy sings. Particularly memorable is the post-date walk of Brandon and Marianne; a real masterpiece.  The entire scene was a single edit from the restaurant to the Delancey Street subway station.  The dialog is great; the interplay between the two is insightful.  The cinematography captures realism of night in Manhattan; a variety of lighting angles and colors. In barely lit segments the couple is mere shadows, then they emerge into light perfectly illuminated.  This tour de force segment is preceded by an incredibly drawn out exchange in the restaurant.  The point was to show Brandons social awkwardness and emotional distance from a meaningful relationship.  But the timing was just wrong; the scene went on for virtual eternity.
Works of drama such as film intentionally condense events occurring on a span of days, month or years into approximately two hours.  The object of the creative team is to give the audience details of the story line  timing is essential.  Some scenes can be short and the message is clear.  Some scenes need to be long and prolonged on a single shot.  The mark of a skilled director is knowing how to maintain a good pace.  Steve McQueen demonstrates great creativity but could learn something from great directors such as Kubrick or Kieslowski, both of whom have mastered the art fixation on a scene, not too long and not too short.  Woody Alan is an example of a director who makes a point with a scene and moves on.
Shame is filled with overextend scenes. One in particular is when Sissy sings New York, New York.  The photography is right on; perfect lighting great framing.  But the song is so slow, if it was not for the pitch Id swear that it was in extra slow motion.  It takes Carey Mulligan so long just to sing out the words New York, New York that I feel I could have crossed Times Square before she hit the second k.  The choice of song was an extreme clich&eacute;.  The applause that followed was unbelievable - the only sound from Sissys audience should have been snoring.  Not only are so many other scenes too long, many are disjointed.  Yes, Brandons life is disjointed and aimless but the story line should have some clarity to it.  No need to explain everything - not everything can be explained  but keep it together.  The film as an entirety is held together with thin slivers of scotch tape.  The art of flashback has been mastered by so many films that even TV such as CSI knows how to do it.  Sadly Mr. McQueen flopped with the flashback sequence regarding Brandons advancement at a woman in bar and antagonizing her boyfriend.  The flashbacks are irregular and poorly timed.  The boyfriends response is unimaginative and trite; he beats up Brandon.  A better response would have been a psychologically scathing verbal rebuke; verbal abuse can be more searing than physical abuse.
McQueens previous movie, Hunger, suffered from similar problems.  I dread to see the Oscar winning 12 Years a Slave.  Hopefully Mr. McQueen has learned something.",1394236800,2,3294,4.765017667844523

Michael Fassbender is courageous to play the role of Brandon Sullivan, a sex addict, because the movie could easily looked like a bad porno if it was done poorly. On the salacious side, Quite a bit of nudity, wow! On the acting side, he is utterly believable as a man who cannot stop his urge for sex, whether its calling up hookers, looking for a partner on a subway, or porn addiction. Brandon is a successful exec of some sort but hes unable to connect with people because of his obsession for sex. I think to a certain degree every man can relate to this, but Brandon just takes it to another level. Brandon is good looking, successful, and not without his charm but instead of seeking relationships he lives on the dingy underbelly of his craving. His sister comes into town, and shes young, beautiful, and completely suicidal. He pushes her away and she attempts to commit suicide.

The performances and characterizations are good and Steve McQueen is an interesting filmmaker. Fassbender and McQueen make for interesting team since this is the second of three pictures they have collaborated on. The first being the Bobby Sands story HUNGER and the other being 12 Years a Slave about Solomon Northrup.

I however, found this movie very relative to my current life-form...and for one will only praise this film.
I can totally identify myself with the main character played by Michael Fassbender  (hehehe what a last name)
with exception to the sister part, and homosexual episode in the middle of the movie, which I can-not relate to.

Some how I missed the fact this was going to be a sexually graphic movie, no romance just two people with sex addictions. Those addictions were all played out before you in full frontal, with both male and female. Had I been a sex therapist I might have found this movie interesting.

Brandon is a good looking introverted 30ish dude who spends most of his waking time thinking and acting out his sexual desires. His sister comes to live with him bringing her own sexual hang ups. He is forced to look at himself - thus the movie title ""Shame""",1391126400,3,609,4.380530973451328

4959883,3,B006512BFU,"If the deliberate opening half wasn't so NC-17,this film would have had a chance to be important as a total work of cinema. But it is an expose of below the waist male and female nudity for quite some time. It prepares you for nothing.

The one relationship sequence that should have been more explicit (Marianne and Brandon trying to find someone beyond mere fast afternoon sex) was skimpy. That sequence had real potential to exploit the ground gained with explicit nudity and very aggressive sexuality earlier. But McQueen, the director, went soft when it counted.

And then it makes sense that after the climactic sequence with the sister, McQueen reached in his script and direction for ambiguity. After all, he had avoided the true roots of his two main characters.

The best acting is the anonymous woman on the subway. The most real character, not a stereotype, is Marianne.

Fassbender does what he can and is good. Carey Mulligan is what Michelle Williams will never beout of her shell and very good. She steals the film even though she has little character to work with.

See it alone or with a very intelligent, compassionate, empathetic partner. It requires character writing, a history of the brother-sister man-woman, only hinted at, which might have made this a great film. You have to bring it yourself. Once you apply that history to the story, it is meaningful.

Afterward, hasten to a shower. The story screams STDs, regardless of Fassbender's fitness.

The tryst in the alley is so bogus, it is sad the writers thought it told us something. That should have been in her car, or outside the car under an overpass or in a place, any place other  than two steps from the sidewalk and her urgently parked vehicle. Even two dogs screwing would have been a better scene (symbolic at least).

McQueen is one more very overrated auteur. Cudos for an ensemble that got naked and faked it for him. The lesbianic hookers in the threesome desperation sequence told me McQueen is no great shakes, but he pimps well.",1391040000,3,2023,4.773638968481375
4959884,1,B006512BFU,"My main problem with this movie...they don't explain ANYTHING! The movie ends abruptly without any real explanations. It's one of those movies where you have to ask yourself ""what the hell did I just watch?"" This movie was absolutely awful. It was slow and boring, and quite frankly, creepy at times. There was really something freakish and almost incestuous about Brandon (Michael Fassbender) and his sister's relationship. At least that's the way it seemed to me. There were times when he behaved rather possessive and jealous like a lover instead of a brother. I mean...not only was he too concerned, for my taste, about who she was sleeping with, but I also found it disturbing that her brother stood there gawking at her while she's naked in the shower. They chose to have an entire conversation with her naked, and facing him. Also, they show her climbing into bed with her brother while he was naked, and him eventually straddling her. These are just a few examples of the ways I never hope to know my brother.

It painfully clear they have some resentment towards each other as well as deep-rooted family issues, but they never tell you what those issues are for real.

To close the show, Brandon goes off on an all-night sex bender where anything goes. Nothing and no one is off limits, prostitutes, masturbation, and even other men. I felt like I was watching an ad for safe sex, or should I say what not to do because his behavior was absolutely reckless and nasty. To think, they show you a seemingly heterosexual man the entire movie only to have him sink so low as to start grabbing up guys in gay bars. That came out of nowhere. I mean...Brandon looked like he almost boinked himself to death.

Needless to say, I was very disappointed. My advice to you is...SKIP IT!",1390867200,3,1782,4.650793650793651

4959889,4,B006512BFU,"If you watch the interviews with Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen about this film, you would think that the hour and forty minutes are basically a parade of Michael naked across the screen--physically naked. And if you watched all of the clips available, it's nearly the same. That's what is focussed on to sell interviews and garner YouTube views.

But there's so much more to this film, as I suspected. You can't listen to a director/write talk about working on a script for two years and not wonder what else is in this film? There has to be more to it. And there is. A lot more.

Brandon is tortured. He's trapped by his own affliction. His own addiction. It runs his life; it consumes his life. Sure, he's able to hold down a job and an apartment, but he had nothing else in his life except his addiction. It's no better than a drug addict or an alcoholic or even someone who overeats. It becomes the sole focus in this poor, tattered life. For him, sex without any joy has become a life with no joy.

It makes you think about your own dirty little vices--a chocolate bar here, a harsh word there. Not necessarily addictions, these are, but they still give you the momentary surge, the feeling of relief that is essentially what Brandon is looking for. The relief from the pressure; the release of the build-up. But the moment of release is just that--a moment. And then the pressure begins again.

Sissy disrupts his patterns, as McQueen says she was meant to do as a character, but there's more to it than that. Her failings and dysfunctions are just as raw and destructive as Brandon's. And he doesn't need to deal with hers as well as his. There's simply not enough room in Brandon's tiny apartment for the two of them and all of their baggage.

As for the look of the film, I adore the long, loving shots of the actors. It feels like authentic actiing in ways that cut-and-run films that are constantly moving from camera to camera breaking up the actors' performances to the point you wonder if they could even sustain a character without the safety net of a cut scene can never achieve. The way this film is shot forces the audience to face the problem head-on without flinching. There is no looking away or cutting away. It complements the subject matter completely.

Fassbender is such a strong actor that he falls apart on the screen with complete authenticity. His looks fall apart as the movie progresses. His clothing becomes less impeccable. Even before he is 'beat up' int he film, he is beat up from the inside. Kudos to him for his portrayal.

An important film that transcends sex and nudity.",1389830400,2,2619,4.559574468085106

serve to be an eye opener about the life altering and life changing effects of abuse (sexual, physical and mental) Contrary to
what many people might believe, survivors of abuse don't always end up as the stereotypical prostitute or drug abuser.  Many manage to lead successful lives on the outside but inside are harboring years of shame, condemnation, and guilt along with
an array of other emotions and behaviors.  No, the movie didn't spell out that these two siblings were abused but they surely were.  Even if the sister had not spoken that cryptic sentence about their past, the signs were all there.  I was engrossed in the characters' lives and found myself wondering if a part two would see Brandon's addiction culminating to a pivotal juncture where he might seek treatment thereby facing his past and trying to heal his wounds.  Would his sister travel along that path with him or try to commit suicide yet again? Would she succeed the next time?

There was one issue I had with this film and it was depictions and implications made of gay men/sex in the film.  (possible spoiler): it seemed that the gay club (was it a dance club with lots of sex or a sex club?) shown in the film was depicted as ""about as low as you could sink,""  filled with men much like the lead character, only gay.

This is a movie I would watch a second time.  And I especially enjoyed the ending.  And, perhaps. the movie wasn't meant to be erotic, but, for me, the scenes on the subway car, at the beginning and end of the movie were more erotic than any of the random sexual encounters thru out the film.

4959908,5,B006512BFU,"After doing research for y own sexual addiction I came across ""Shame"", a film I never heard of. It's really an art film or indie film that didn't get a lot of attention at the box office, but became the darling a various film festivals around the world. ""Shame"" also made its star, Michael Fassbender, a hot commodity in Hollywood and London.

 The movie delves into the controversial subject of male sexual addiction, its effects on the man and how it effects those around him.

 Brandon (the Fassbender character) has everything a man in his '30's wants: a well-paying job, women falling for him left and right and a great apartment. Yet, something eludes him and bothers him. He can never get enough sex whether its masturbating, having sex with prostitutes or going in the back of gay bars.

 The movie is explicit with much nudity and Michael Fassbender does a great job showing both his back and frontal male parts. Hopefully, the film will show other actors that there is nothing wrong in showing off the male penis.

 While watching the film the subtext is clear...both Brandon and his sister Sissy were obviously abused sexually, physically and mentally although those words are never mentioned. You really want to hate the Brandon character and say get help and get off your ass, but you realize he is going down a dark and dingy road, a road that may destroy him.

There are pockets of information left out of his storylines; however he leaves the viewer to fill in those gaps as they wish to.  Sort of like those ""choose your own ending"" books I read as a kid.  In the end, the gaps don't take away from the story and don't really matter.

With that being said, Steve's movies are the kind an individual can stomach once, so pay attention the first time around.  Hunger was difficult to watch at times, but Shame really took that to the next level.  The last 15 minutes of this movie are sexually graphic and somehow manage to make one feel filthy not aroused at all.  I felt like I was watching a fast track train wreck about to occur.

First - yes there's sex here, but its only because of the (brief, brief, brief) male frontal nudity that I can determine it had the explicit rating.  You'll see as much watching a cable series (Game of Thrones, Masters of Sex, Michael Donovan, ect.)

My problem with the movie is that it never really goes anywhere.  It lets you peek into the lives of some broken individuals, but never gives more than a murky reasoning for their genesis, or any conclusion.  ""Life goes on"" is about the crux of the matter here.

I enjoy movies that delve into the art of storytelling and and on that mark ""Shame"" falls flat - really.  Not much of an arc for the characters at all. Well cast, the actors languish in roles that never see them flesh out - pardon the pun.  The shame of this movie is that its not as good as it could have been.",1387411200,,993,4.24468085106383

4959942,5,B006512BFU,"This film offers a very realistic picture of sexual addiction.  However it is also a tragic film as we see a very dysfunctional brother and sister as they each suffer in very different ways with a mysterious past, a barren present, and a hopeless future. Michael Fassbender repeatedly demonstrates that he is a superb actor, probably the best currently in films. Carey Mulligan offers a performance that is awesome as she portrays a very damaged young woman, trying to connect, driven by helpless dependency. Fassbinder plays a young New York businessman who deals with anxiety and emergence of painful thoughts or memories by changing his consciousness through sexual arousal and orgasm. Sexual arousal will temporarily divert him from disturbed thoughts or painful memories and his sexual behaviors have now become a standard escape from his thoughts. He shares a dark history with his younger sister, Sissy, and whereas they may be all each other has in the world, they evoke compulsions and negative emotions that makes this brother and sister relationship very dysfunctional. Mulligan's performance is tops.

Director Steve McQueen has created a winner. The actors are flawless. The soundtrack uses a mixture of classical and pop that makes the film contemporary and yet contemplative.  The portion of the soundtrack written specifically for the film is excellent and evokes the tragic presence of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. Like Barber's Adagio, the soundtrack conveys a sense of deterministic tragedy.

In understanding sexual addiction, it is important to realize that the compulsive rituals of searching for sex, having sex, and having orgasm that help the compulsive escape the unpleasant memories or thoughts.  This film demonstrates that better than anything I have seen regarding compulsive and addictive behavior.

This is also an intelligent film, never filling in the gaps but allowing the audience just enough information to make sense of the characters and the action. If you like films where all the parts come together, where all mysteries are explained, where there are no gaps left to the imagination, then this is not the film for you.

Whatever happened to Brandon in his youth, he seems unable to form meaningful relationships and he undermines relationships that inch toward real intimacy. His sister seeks intimacy with him but she uses sexuality to gain intimacy which is exactly what he does not need in a familial relationship. They are locked in a dangerous dysfunctional relationship which Brandon dreads and avoids if possible. The film has considerable sexual content, in fact the most sexual content I have seen in a film in a very long time. However it was absolutely essential to the film since it shows Brandon sexually acting out to avoid his own thoughts and feelings. Fassbender does an outstanding job in a difficult role. I recommend it for adults.",1383004800,,2900,5.197002141327623

4959947,3,B006512BFU,"First the positives, why I gave it 3 stars.  Michael Fassbender is a great actor and is great in this, he's the reason I watched it.  I also like Carey Mulligan but this wasn't one of her best films.  Fassbender plays Brandon, a sex addict.  I think his addiction was portrayed as powerfully as it could have been, which was effective - sex scenes that do nothing but scream how empty he is inside, how badly he lacks the ability to emotionally connect.  Director Steve McQueen does a great job of conveying the characters' emotions and thoughts often without anyone saying a word.  I like that.

Now the negatives.  The very slow pace is effective in the beginning, but wore on my patience as the movie progressed.  Too slow for too long.  And by the end of the movie I just wanted to take a shower and watch a really funny comedy.  The movie left me feeling dirty, empty, and depressed.  Sometimes movies do that, and I can handle it, but in this case it ended up being for no reason whatsoever.  In the end the characters are as bad or worse than they were in the beginning.

4959950,3,B006512BFU,"""The controversial drama, Shame, directed by Steve McQueen, is one of the rare films these days that has received an NC-17 rating solely based on the sex and nudity depicted. Much to surprise and years of experience watching films, the content while frank and mature is treated with responsibility and a sense of melancholy not found in many R-rated films for that matter. Shame's treatment of human functions and crude material is not the same as The Hangover, Freddy Got Fingered, or Scary Movie, for example.

Aside from that acknowledgment, the story examines Brandon, a loner in New York conflicted with his own perverted vices which in turn get worse as he becomes more alienated with his estranged sister who is a singer. The film's examination of the man is a one of sorrow and frustration often taking very extended scenes of him running down the city, looking down being quiet, or talking and chatting to sexual encounters he meets in the town.

The way McQueen makes you approach the subject did certainly break a few corners of patience with audiences but for what it is, it did stood out much in the same way that Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream did by glimpsing on addiction in itself (which is a bigger theme here) and its problems. The cinematography and music scheme here are responsibly done and very minimalistic yet brooding for what it is that you almost think is this man really worth your time to watch or is just an object?

As a whole, Shame is not a very good film as it is but it is a prolonged and graphic example of how human decisions and lack of self-control can leave a trail of multiple issues not asked for. Thankfully, the film was used as a talking piece for many addiction committees and organizations across the United States which has rendered the scary, horrific, mysterious NC-17 to feel more like an R (in which the film could have earned if, by MPAA rule, trimmed any sight of nudity or focus of protracted action). Don't watch this on a sunny day but as a film studies case.",1378512000,,2023,4.613888888888889

There was nothing sexy about this movie at all. It is a shame that the brother and sister do not actually confront the issue of his acting out, just confront each other about an untidy apartment.

It's not a linear movie with a linear message and the kind that are open for linear interpretation. Depending on who you are, you will identify with it differently.
The main actor, Michael Fassbender gives a stunning performance throughout. His skill is most evident during the semi-orgy scene, when we see him in the mirror, like a lost child about to cry, for being lost, waiting to be found, trying to break through again and again.

4959969,4,B006512BFU,"I will preface this review by stating that I am a twenty-five year old male that has grown up in the generation of instant and copious access to pornography. Both myself and my peer group grow up with our first sexual experiences being a dive into the world of internet pornography. Sexual addiction is nothing new (albeit, the medical definition and treatment/payments are), but this film explores hyper sexual addiction, split identities, excess, conflict of the self, and of course... shame.

Cast

The film is cast excellently. The action primarily focuses on Michael Fassbender's character with some minor support from other characters throughout the film.  Michael Fassbender absolutely rivals the dark, unstable, yet professional Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'. I am willing to give the nod to Fassbender solely because the subject matter of this film requires much more emotion and authenticity to deliver the desired sociopathic results. The supporting cast is additionally formidable. Fassbender's on-screen sister is absolutely wonderful as a troubled counterpart (and her scene singing in the bar is absolutely moving).

Plot

The plot of this film is absolutely not for everyone. This is clearly not a family film. I recommend this film if you are someone who enjoys allegories about human sexuality, dilemmas of the self, or even suffer from addictions yourself. Essentially, Fassbender's character is a fairly affluent young professional living in a big city. He works his 9-5 day job and parties in the evening. However, behind closed doors he compulsively views internet porn and subscribes to prostitutes. He sates his sexual hunger and desire for others by abusing himself sexually in the formerly mentioned activities. As the film progresses, you can see the tolls that his lifestyle is taking on him. You can even sense the shift in consciousness as he struggles with himself to overcome his addictions.

Soundtrack

Subtle and very effective. The accompanying music to this film is absolutely appropriate and very well executed. Again, see the bar scene for the excellent vocal performance.

Overall

This film was very enjoyable and very welcoming to immersion on a dark reality of life. The characters were appropriately introduced and developed, the plot moves effectively, the ramp up and eventual climax are well executed, and the falling action was reasonable given the content of the film.

4959974,5,B006512BFU,"I saw a trailer for this film far before it's actual release and was immediately excited to see it. It seemed like a riveting story and the cinematography was superb. Luckily, the movie easily met my already high expectations.

As a forewarning, if you are uncomfortable with sexually explicit scenes or content, you may want to stray from this film. The graphic content doesn't reach a point of x-rated pornography but it definitely doesn't shy away on the sexual content. Keep in mind that though that the sexual content heavily pertains to the character and narrative so it is very much so a warranted aspect to the film. This film focuses heavily on Fassbender's portrayal of his character struggling with sex addiction and how it affects his relationships, as well as, himself

I remark that solely due to a personal debate I had with another as to the necessity of the sexual content in the film. That being said, do not be deterred by the introductory emphasis on the graphic content in this film. It is, in my strongest opinion, a masterful work by both the director and the cast.

Fassbender nailed his character to the teeth. From his body language, to his facial expressions, to his natural flow within his movements and his dialogue, he managed to highlight the strengths and traits of a sex addict perfectly. When his character shows weakness, it's evident how much it pains his character. Many of my friends often complain about how actors are horrible at crying but, in all honesty, I found Fassbender's portrayal of emotional turmoil to be spot on.

As for Mulligan, she coincided with Fassbender so easily that I completely lost any disbelief in the film and legitimately believed in their characters. Her back-and-forth dialogue with Fassbender flowed so naturally that it's easy to lose yourself in their relationship. Although Fassbender is main protagonist, Mulligan definitely deserves some notoriety for her abilities as an actress in this film. Her performance is easily as impressive as Fassbender's.

Regarding cinematography and aesthetic elements in the film, the film really creates a unique atmosphere with it's locations and environments surrounding the narrative. Characters decay into darker places but it's often the case that characters fall apart in the brightest environments. The correlations between atmosphere and plot development are both unique and intriguing. The shots themselves are artistic and well placed. They fit naturally alongside each scenario/plot point and never become a nuisance. As for the audio and music, the voices are clean and dialogue is clear; however, music is always entirely up to one's preference. There will be many moments of silence and they definitely play into the natural feel but I personally loved the ambience.

Please note though, that this is a PAL, Reg. 2 disc as it is mentioned in the title. If you are an American customer, you will need to reformat your laptop or device to be able read PAL (unless you have some converter) so be prepared for that and look into ways you can get around it.

In conclusion, I think this film is a masterful piece. Fassbender and Mulligan are certainly two actors the world should take note of as their performances in this film were absolutely marvelous. If you haven't had a chance to see this film, I highly suggest you get yourself a copy and check it out. Just be careful when viewing it around others due to the sexual content. In the end though, I loved this film and I hope you guys love it as well.",1366156800,4,3523,4.9109243697478995

It truly was heartbreaking to watch Brandon struggle through his daily life trying to find a way to shift through the haze of emotions that he felt he wasn't equipped to deal with. Brandon's relationship with his troubled sister Sissy, brought to life by Carrie Mulligan, sheds more light into the reasons behind Brandon's obsessive need to keep his head filled with lust rather than focus on his present personal and family life.

4959996,2,B006512BFU,"Sigh. Why do so many ""art house"" movies take such an interesting premise and make it so grindingly sterile, one dimensional, and ridiculous? The idea of this movie was obvious immediately, and then we have another hour or so watching a sad, DAMAGED in 30-point font man and a manic pixie dreamgirl (look up the phrase) gone stereotypically wrong. I knew when I saw the scene where Sissy, as tremulous and fragile as a moth wing, sang ""New York, New York"" that critics would fall all over themselves in praise, but I could only roll my eyes at the silliness of it--the CLICHE of it and think ""of course she sang THAT song. And of COURSE that way."". This movie reminded me not of American Psycho, as some have said--mainly because Christian Bale kept a small wink of joy in the role--but more like ""In The Company of Men"", where miserable people just were relentlessly miserable, letting nothing breathe. I mean, come ON. Even traumatized (oooo possibly incestuous--another cliche alert!!) siblings can let a little air into their dialog. I found more life and realism in the subway flirtation scene than I did the whole movie; it underscored little victories we get from reading signs that someone is physically interested and seemed (to me) why sex addiction is a real addiction and not just something to numb pain. That scene was the difference between an alcholic being shown having ""just a little more"" versus a ham-fisted performance of the actor looking tormented, up-ending a whole bottle of scotch.

4959997,3,B006512BFU,"After hearing a lot of great things about Shame, I have to say I came away from it slightly disappointed. The story follows sex-addict Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender), whose mundane and brutal existence is interrupted by the arrival of his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The film exposes the sordid underbelly of Manhattan and follows the breakdown of the relationship between the two siblings, as Brandon becomes increasingly irritated and suffocated by Sissy's presence.

McQueen purposely leaves out the protagonists' back-story, leaving it up to the viewer to imagine what 'shameful' upbringing led to their neurotic and isolated adult lives. The problem I had with this was that it was hard to feel any sort of empathy for the siblings as they unravelled desperately throughout the film, or to feel any emotional response towards them by the end. Thus when Sissy did her (agonisingly) slow rendition of `New York, New York' which brings Brandon to tears, I was left emotionally cold and slightly bored. Also, although I found the majority of the sex-scenes important in revealing Brandon's desires and motivations, I found myself really irritated by the final threesome, which dragged on forever and seemed entirely gratuitous. I was not convinced by the casting choice of having Mulligan play Sissy, as I did not find her quite manic or desperate enough and she appeared slightly one-dimensional throughout.

Having said that, there were a lot of great moments in the film - Fassbender's acting was phenomenal throughout and the film was well-paced and shot beautifully - showing the gritty underside of urban life and the cold, bare monotonous routine of Brandon's sex-obsessed existence. The relationship between Sissy and Brandon was compelling (and uncomfortable) to watch; plagued by need, anger and incestuous desire. The most interesting parts of the film were the scenes between Brandon and his recently separated co-worker, Marianne, as they debated the point of monogamy in modern life, and eventually embarked on a doomed sexual encounter. Although I thought the film had its flaws, Steve McQueen's directorial style was unique, beautifully real and definitely thought-provoking, which made them somewhat forgivable.",1359244800,,2240,5.397142857142857

4960001,1,B006512BFU,"[BEWARE OF SPOILERS]

Imagine a film which is a less energetic, yet similarly pointless, variation of American Psycho. That film is Shame, whose skin-deep what-you-see-is-what-you-get script would not have been so disappointing had any of the characters, but especially the two vaguely-traumatized main characters, been remotely interesting. Sadly they live in a world of upper-income banality dominated by glass and de-saturated colors, a world where every character is despicable in the only way that an economically un-imperiled and seemingly endlessly privileged character can be despicable, which is in the most boring way possible. They are not witty. They are not exuberant. They are just . . . dull, because more or less dissatisfied with their moneyed existence. Sound familiar?

The screenwriters seem to have intended Brandon and Sissy (the sibling leads) to be an out clause in this respect by burdening Brandon with sex addiction and Sissy with co-dependence and then attempting to justify this behavior with an oblique reference to a past sexual trauma: ""We're not bad people,"" says Sissy, ""we just come from a bad place."" And that's that. We never learn who abused them, or the exact nature of the abuse. Nor would this information be necessary were Brandon or Sissy charming or seductive or otherwise compelling. But they are none of these things: Brandon just . . . has sex. Lots of it. And he ignores Sissy. And Sissy clings to Brandon. Less-is-more must have been the idea behind Brandon and Sissy, but it undoes them quite. Less is less, in their case. They are not Iago or Hannibal Lecter, for whom opacity worked.

This lack of transparency forces the viewer to make sense of their behavior through amateur guesswork. For example: Brandon, denied entry to a nightclub, is so desperate to get off that he resorts to a gay sex dungeon for this purpose. This makes little sense unless we're meant to suspect him of using promiscuity, which had hitherto involved only women, to cope with latent homosexuality. If we're meant to think that Brandon is so enslaved by his addiction that he would sink so low as a gay bar, then the screenwriters should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. And the brother/sister interactions are so bizarre--Sissy standing comfortably naked in front of an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy constantly hugging/touching an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy having sex with an uncomfortable Brandon's slimy boss in Brandon's bed, Sissy climbing into bed with a Brandon who is so uncomfortable that he screams at her to get out--that I had to wonder if the trauma from their past was a touch taboo.

But all this speculation is only necessary because the film and its controversial sexual content is so very boring. At one point, Sissy and Brandon's slimy boss, a married man with children who makes it his business to hit on every woman he and Brandon encounter in a bar or restaurant, have this exchange:

Him: [Holding Sissy's hand. The sleeve of her dress rolls back to reveal her wrist, which is apparently scarred.] What happened to your arm?
Her: Oh, when I was a kid I was bored.
Him: Well, you must've been really bored.
Her: I was.

4960003,5,B006512BFU,"Directed by Steve McQueen, ""Shame"" explores sexual addiction, alienation, and loneliness in contemporary New York City. With its many sex scenes, the film manages to be unerotic. The movie and its actors have received numerous accolades. The acting is convincing and the scenes of city life well drawn. Many viewers will find this film disturbing.

The film stars Michael Fassbender as a successful 30ish professional named Brandon who cannot control his sexual appetites or channel his sexuality into a relationship. Brandon is both a predator and a victim. He is apparently able to pick up attractive similarly lonely women on the spot for short encounters. Brandon also uses the services of prostitutes. When he is home alone, he watches pornography and camgirls on his computer. He gets confronted with a wide range of pornographic material on his office computer. He is unable to function in an attempted relationship with a coworker, Marianne, (Nichole Beharie) which involves attempted emotion beyond sex. Fassbender plays this role well in his lines, dress, gestures, and facial expressions. He has a sense of decency and is at war with himself.

The other primary character in ""Shame"" is Brandon's younger sister Sissie played by Carrie Mulligan. Sissie has suicidal tendencies and is emotionally needy. She moves in with Brandon early in the film and the emotional tension mounts between the siblings as the movie progresses. Each sees the serious, devastating issues in the life of the other. Brandon's sexual addition and his relationship with Sissie become intertwined and form the two themes of this movie.

The movie makes have use of atmosphere to establish the sordid character of Brandon's mind. There are many scenes of crowded subways which capture the lonely, solitary character of much urban life. There are pick-up scenes in bars, from the fancy to the seedy, which stress lack of emotional connection. The movie shows several scenes of paid sex between Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties. The musical score is ominous and brooding, punctuated by Glenn Gould playing Bach and by various pop songs. Sissie is trying to make it as a singer and, in a pivotal scene of the movie, offers a rendition of ""New York New York"" in the company of Brandon and his boss.

The movie includes substantial nudity, male and female. To their credit, the producers declined to soften the movie to receive an ""R"" rather than a ""NC-17"" rating. The movie offers an effective portrayal of how sex can become a narcotic to deal with loneliness in a harsh world.

4960006,4,B006512BFU,"Shame is a disturbing and painful movie to watch for many reasons, not the least of which may be the mirror it holds up to us.  In a slow, quiet, and uninhibited style, director Steve McQueen takes us into the life of Brandon, a successful Manhattan-ite, and his ne'er do well sister, two tormented souls who might just as easily be seen as two sides of the same coin. Brandon is sterile and emotionally vacant and Sissy is a raging co-dependent whose emotions are always boiling at the surface. Both address their emotional issues with sex, Sissy hoping that every new encounter brings her the caretaker she so desperately needs and Brandon seeking only the cold anonymous release.

The movie is intense, not so much for the sex (although it isn't going to be to everyone's taste), but rather because it forces us to look at how we deal with our own issues. It might make us feel better to delineate between ""addicts"" and the rest of us, but this is merely semantics. Putting a tag on someone because it distances their behavior from yours doesn't make you superior. Shame demonstrates that ""addicts"" (a term vastly over-used) are people who aren't handling their problems in the right way. They are not deviants or sickos or freaks, but wounded human beings - just like you. While most of us haven't sunk as low as these two, we still have our compulsions. Maybe you over-eat, are an exercise freak, or shop incessantly - one way or another we have to deal with our insecurities, traumas, and stress in some way or else we fall apart. Shame is an exploration of two people who use sex to ease their psychological pain, but what I liked about this movie was that it showed how universal our problems are. It's only in how we deal with it that we see differences, and hopefully Shame points out that disgust merely hides hypocrisy, and thus denial for those who can't see at least a little of themselves in these wounded and sympathetic characters.",1357344000,5,1948,4.627167630057803

4960008,4,B006512BFU,"His name is Brandon and he is a sex addict.  He spends virtually his entire waking life either having sex, planning on having sex, or watching others have sex.

How he got to be this way is never fully explained in the screenplay by Steve McQueen (who also directed the movie) and Abi Morgan, though it is darkly hinted that it might have something to do with some form of sexual abuse in the character's past.  This is particularly likely given the unhealthy proclivity he seems to have for his even more lost and dysfunctional sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who comes to live with him in his Manhattan penthouse early on in the movie.  Brandon will do it with just about anyone - though he seems to have drawn the line at Sissy, at least based on the struggling and angst he undergoes in her presence, though we`re never quite sure about what might have happened between the two of them in the past.  Of course, the fact that Brandon is sexy and handsome means he's never at a loss for willing and attractive partners.  It is also no surprise that the one woman (Nicole Beharie) who actually gets into his head and possibly even his heart - a co-worker who thinks there should be more to relationships than mere one-night stands - is the one for whom he is unable to perform in the only way he knows how.

""Shame"" is a subtle and provocative drama that explores how sex and sexuality have changed in the modern era - in some ways for the better and in many ways for the worse.  Certainly Brandon and Sissy demonstrate some of the pitfalls inherent in a world where sex is so readily available, thanks in large part to advancements in technology, the proliferation of porn, and relaxed social mores.  But ""Shame"" never feels the need to preach to the audience nor to look down on its characters.  It presents us to them in all their physical and emotional nakedness, then lets us render our own judgment on them - or lack thereof.

In a brave and soul-baring performance, Michael Fassbender brings a rawness and a vulnerability to the role of Brandon that allow us to feel for the character without ever begging for our pity.  The same goes for Mulligan, whose craziness and desperation are infrequently tempered by moments of clarity and wisdom.

4960019,5,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" is a movie that you won't soon forget. It's not simply a movie about sex...it's a lot more, and I'm rather surprised by its NC-17 rating, because the movie to my judgement is not gratuitous or excessive or offensive in its sexual content or imagery. The film has a quiet strength grounded by its extraordinary cinematography- visceral, restrained, urban, intimate, skewed, dangerous, and real at all turns. The story centers around Brandon, deftly portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He's in an office 9-5 in New York City; his apartment is sterile and cold. His office is a place of posturing and masculine one-upsmanship; his release is through sex, which in itself becomes a prison and and a compulsion. Yet as we see Michael's compulsion interfere with his life, I was not filled with disgust, revulsion, or pity but struck with how powerfully real and painful and fraught with humanity the portrait of the man became. When Brandon's chanteuse sister Sissy (expertly portrayed by Carey Mulligan) enters the picture (and camps out unwelcome and uninvited to his apartment)it is obvious the two share a complex and troubled past; the specifics are not elaborated upon but can be inferred. When Brandon's home life becomes more complicated, he seeks the company of his coworker Marianne. Brandon's stab at a more ""normal"" relationship reveals the primal fear he has of emotional intimacy when sex with Marianne can't be consummated. Her loving embrace and caresses bring Brandon genuine fear as opposed to his go-to porn, one-night stands,  and visits to prostitutes. Yes, the movie is about sex, but it is so much more. It is about the fear of intimacy that can cause extremes of behavior in all of us. It's about levels of dishonesty within ourselves and others,  power and perceptions therof, and a struggle for control over one of our most primal urges. A surprising ending and a thoughtful and sobering  conclusion reveal that the scars we carry on our body are often visible but more often buried underneath a veneer of normality.",1351382400,7,2042,5.0

4960023,4,B006512BFU,"At first one might think this is an excuse to show a lot of nudity and sex but once you see that Michael Fassbender (the addict) and Carey Mulligan (his sister) are in this picture you realize they aren't doing this piece because they have no other movie offers.

Fassbender plays a charming and alluring bachelor who just cannot get enough sex as he's a sex addict. His codependent sister keeps leaving him messages early on  and he tries to avoid her but she shows up and moves in, making matters worse as she reminds him of their issues and thus do you get to see their dysfunctional relationship.

The sexual scenes vary in tempo and style and tastes. At first one might think it's sexy but later on you realize it's a man with a really serious problem and then you're no longer feeling it. No pun intended. At times you see the pain on his features as he realizes he is going down a destructive path. At one point it looks like he's going to change but a failed love prompts him to return to his usual habits. And then something else happens and maybe he will change.

The tale ends with the old question of whether the character will change or stay the same. I think that was the best they could do as they didn't want to make light on the addiction by just acting like he cured it in a few weeks.

Interesting musical score of Old School piano music to balance the tempo of the film.

Overall, a gutsy picture that went to a spot most people would fear. Once again, no pun intended.

The budget for this intensive character study was $6.5M and it made a bit over $17M at the Box Office.

SPOILERS: there's an intimacy between the dysfunctional brother and sister. Notice that at one point he deals with her nude and then vice versa. I found it interesting that Mulligan's character would say she was sorry yet she didn't apologize when he caught her masturbating. Instead, she found it funny.

The black woman was the main characters best chance at a real relationship yet when the sex became too intimate he literally just walked away and stared out the window. When she tried to appease him (thinking he had failed to get hard) he just made things worse by being distant to her kind gestures. The failure of that led him down a drunken path in which he got beat up and ignored his sister's low moment and plea for help and then found her in the bathroom with her wrists slit.",1349740800,,2567,4.452025586353945

4960039,5,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" is an amazing film.  It is raw, gritty and sexual.  But it has a point.  What I saw in this film was a guy, Brandon played by Michael Fassbender, who has the biologic urges that most men have.  There is some hint of a dysfunctional past that we never fully understand, except through glimpses with his sister played by Carey Mulligan.  However, as much as Brandon needs sexual adventure, he almost totally lacks a capacity for intimacy.  Some have called the look of the film austere and cold from Brandon's icy urban apartment to his work cubicle to the subway trains he rides.  This mirrors his internal state and emphasizes the lack of human warmth.

Sex, when it comes from love, produces some of the most valuable and important of human experiences -- feelings of acceptance, joy, security, tenderness, passion and beauty.  When sex comes from a self-centered place of lust, it can be one of the most damaging of human emotions.

The date that Brandon has with coworker Marianne, played by Nicole Beharie, contrasts Marianne's search for love and Brandon's need to satisfy desire.  As a result, Brandon hires prostitutes that he can use and be done with, scans computer sex sites, prowls at clubs, and has his momentary satisfaction, but is left with an internal emptiness that haunts him, played so well by Fassbender.  After a fight with his sister, Brandon fingers a girl at a bar which leads to a beating by her boyfriend which leads Brandon to follow a guy eyeing him into a gay club which leads to shame and his need to atone by having two women at the same time.  This poor guy is so trapped; he spins from sexual episode to episode like a rat in a maze.

The film is bookended by Brandon staring at a woman on the subway, played by Lucy Walters.  At the opening of the film, he leers at her, flirting, until she reveals a wedding band which only whets his appetite.  At the end of the film, he again sees the same girl and looks at her coldly, which I read as a lesson learned that casual sex would not bring him ultimate satisfaction.

I am impressed by the number of awards this film won:
Black Reel Awards: Best Director, Best Screenplay
British Independent Film Awards: Best Actor (Michael Fassbender)
Evening Standard British Film Awards: Best Actor

Fassbender's performance is fearless, edgy and makes us ache for this man who has so much potential, and yet is so screwed up and unhappy.  Carey Mulligan turns in an excellent performance as his sister.  James Badge Dale also turns in a strong supporting performance as David, Brandon's boss who has a fling with Brandon's sister, Sissy.

4960040,4,B006512BFU,"It's been a month or more since I watched this movie, and it's really stuck with me like few other movies in recent memory have.  It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, of course -- its pacing is slow and deliberate, and it doesn't have much in the way of a traditional plot.

It merely follows the personal life (with brief glimpses of his professional life) of a man who's trying to juggle his work, his dysfunctional relationship with his sister, and his excessive, uh, lustful compulsions.  It felt like one of the most honest and topical movies I've seen in a long time.  We live in a culture that's obsessed with sex.  Now that computers and high-speed internet have become commonplace, the majority of adolescent and adult males consume pornography on a regular basis.  This movie, unlike just about every other movie that's come out of Hollywood over the past 3 decades, focuses on the dark reality of modern sex, and how compulsively seeking sexual gratification can lead to serious problems and even misery.  Fassbender and Mulligan both give excellent, emotional, memorable performances in the process.

If any of the above sounds like something you'd be interested in, then I'd enthusiastically recommend this movie.  If you need a traditional plot structure or constant action to maintain your interest, then look elsewhere.",1344124800,,1342,4.955357142857143
4960041,5,B006512BFU,"To all of the actors we've been introduced to over the past few years, two that have made a significant impression have been Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. After seeing Fassbender in more commercial films like 300 and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he made quite an impression, and after seeing Mulligan in AN EDUCATION, I was totally taken with her talent and charm. Then I saw and was absolutely stunned by Fassbender's performance in HUNGER (directed by this film's director Steve McQueen), based on a true story of an Irish political prisoner who goes on a hunger strike. It was an amazing performance and probably one of the most affecting performances of recent years. Also continuing to shine was Mulligan in films like the haunting and underrated NEVER LET ME GO and my personal pick of best film of 2011, DRIVE.

But SHAME is a showcase for both of these great actors in incredibly bare (both figuratively and literally) and incredibly powerful performances.

Fassbender plays Brandon, a young professional in New York City. He is also a sex addict, and while some people play around with the idea of defining Brandon as such, it is absolute. He cannot function throughout the day without different sexual acts, liasons, and exposure to sexual input, and the level of danger that it can represent is of little consequence to him; It's the same as being a drug addict or an alcoholic. Then comes along Sissy (Mulligan), Brandon's less responsible and emotionally unstable sister as she invades his apartment and his life. She is an addict of a different sort; she craves love and attention and affection, and Brandon, being who he is, seems incapable of giving something of what she wants to her.

Fassbender plays Brandon as something of a predator; riding the subway, he scans the different people and finds a beautiful woman who smiles at him, but he never smiles back. He looks as her as if she's a meal or a fix; something to sate his neverending appetite, and when she gets off the train, he pursues her in a very unsettling way. He is also emotionally empty inside and realizes it. He's not a sociopath; he just uses sex to express all of his feelings and to fill the emptiness inside him. The closer he gets to someone emotionally, the more sexual encounters he requires, and this builds to a crescendo of self-punishment and more extreme sexual acts when he and Sissy have a massive fight about their meaning to one another. Mulligan plays Sissy as someone who is desperate for attention and affection, but in a more playful manner than Brandon's predatory persona. She may initially appear as quirky and free-spirited, but is as equally self-destructive, seeking affection in places she knows she can't get them.

McQueen, who also directed the marvelous and extremely unsettling HUNGER directs this film with the same level of attention to detail and with the same verve of the construction of a scene. He also knows how to direct a scene that is so incredibly tense yet be somewhat innocent at the same time and this is best displayed with two scenes: the scene where Brandon discovers Sissy in his apartment in his shower fully nude and his eyes linger perhaps a little too long at her and yet she allows it rather than covering up with the towel immediately, suggesting there may have been something in their past that has been more than familial; also the scene in which Sissy sings a very torch-song rendition of ""New York, New York"", and the camera is close in on her face for most of the song, but cuts back to Fassbender, in obvious distress.

This film arguably doesn't require the NC-17 rating aside from the casual male nudity and a few very brief moments of graphic imagery, especially since other NC-17 or Unrated releases within recent memory have featured full, unsimulated sex, like many of the films of Catherine Brelliat, John Cameron Mitchell's brilliant SHORTBUS, or Michael Winterbottom's 9 SONGS, but this film actually wears that rating like a badge of honor. The sex and nudity within this film is certainly not meant to tittilate or excite or even to shock. It is there because it's a vital part of the story of this character. It's there because in order for us to understand, we have to experience on something of a similar and visceral level, and this film could honestly not exist without it. The sex and nudity of the film is not nearly as controversial as the actual subject matter is, and it doubtless will offend people, but the people it would offend really shouldn't be watching this film anyway.

Both Fassbender (who is arguably the hardest working actor in film over the last two years, and he's been the highlight of just about all of the films he's been in) and Mulligan give extraordinary performances, but it's without a doubt Fassbender's film. And it's a testament to the performers' courage to be actors known for their magnetism (no pun intended for Fassbender) and charisma to allow them to be shown at their least charismatic.

SHAME is a challenging, intelligent, and at times a terrifying film, and it's absolutely not a piece of art that anyone involved should be ashamed of.",1344124800,13,5144,4.792559188275084

The performances were excellent and multi-layered. I guess I thought it was going to be more about Brandon's (Michael Fassbender) sexual addiction, but it really was much more about making connections with people, emotional stress, the price of relationships. Yes, he turned to porn and prostitutes for release and relief from his otherwise tightly wound, buttoned up life that was carefully constructed to hide the pain surging beneath. But the real story was the tension between him and his sister, the beautiful and frail but manipulative Sissy (hope I'm spelling that right), whose instability leashed them together. They never talked explicitly about their past, but you knew something had to have happened to them to make them this way. They were like shell-shocked survivors of a war who never learned how to function in ""normal"" society. But then the movie also does a great job of peeling back the layer on what is ""normal"" as well, when it shows Brandon's married boss having a loving chat with his son one minute, then sleeping with Sissy the next, with no regard for a tortured Brandon in the next room. There is also a flirtatous yet married woman on the subway who is the narrative arc tying together the beginning and end of the tale. Of all of them, Brandon seems to be the one who truly craves a connection with another human being, while everyone around him is just throwing away what comes so easily to them. Very emotional, and really makes you think. Overall, I thought this was a truly masterful and heart-wrenching piece of filmmaking and acting.",1343347200,11,1716,4.781144781144781
4960045,3,B006512BFU,"Is there something wrong with me if I do not feel that the character Brandon has a sex addiction? I see his sexual decisions as typical male behavior; his life isn't destroyed--he still has a job, money, home. Seems pretty stable to me. So what if he can't connect with some/most women/men on a more 'socially-desired/accepted/expected' relationship level? It may not be his time and/or not the right person. The pressure to be like everyone else is more detrimental IMO. Perhaps this movie would have been better off with more focus on Brandon's relationship with his unstable sister, which seems to hint at something abnormal/forbidden in the past.

Michael Fassbender is a great actor, no argument there, but why cast Mulligan? I think she's a terrible actress, too one dimensional and her struggle to act is too noticeable.  McQueen's directing style is not quite to my liking (with his pattern of long, drawn-out scenes that overstay their visit, sudden time jumps, AWOL characters, etc), but I've seen worse. I was disappointed with this movie though, given how much hype its been getting. This movie would have been 1-2 stars if it weren't for Fassbender.",1343174400,,1162,4.984536082474227
4960046,5,B006512BFU,"Addiction.  Addiction is a problem that takes on many faces, some of which we all too often ignore or consider overblown.  Sexual addiction.  For those who do not have that problem they may joke that they wish they did.  What is the problem with having a lot of sex?  Why would anyone complain about that?  How could that possibly ruin someone's life?  To those of us who may at one time or another balked at the notion that `sex addicts have it rough' may want to reconsider our perspective, and for that rude awakening we have been handed Steve McQueen's sophomore film, `Shame'.

The premise of `Shame' is rather simple.  We have Brandon, a business man who lives alone and has a lot of sex with random strangers he meets in random places.  His sister, Sissy, comes over unannounced and gets permission to sleep on the couch for a while.  Both Sissy and Brandon have deep rooted emotional issues, that obviously stem from a childhood they never discuss, and so they clash like oil and water.  Brandon is seemingly introverted yet blunt and suave, allowing him to take his potential lovers by surprise and sweep them into his bed for a romp.  Sissy is overtly friendly, using her loud personality to omit a confident sexuality that one detects she uses to replace the self-esteem she lost along the way.  Both people are broken fragments of a former self.  McQueen uses this simple premise to exploit the pain welled up inside of these people and uses their addictions as a way to make a profound statement about the powerful hold our own insecurities can have on us.

Yes, this is very explicit and yet never once becomes something titillating because the sorrowful overlay completely consumes the film.

Much has been made of Michael Fassbender's performance here.  He won the Vulpi Cup (at the Venice Film Festival) early in the year and then steamrolled through critics' awards (with few wins but many mentions) and then was disgustingly snubbed an Oscar nomination.  All that has been said was deserved.  The way that Michael molds the pain and inner demons into the very fabric of Brandon's person is outstanding.  Matching him every step, and maybe even surpassing him a step or two, is the amazing Carey Mulligan (god, how I love this woman).  She embodies Sissy with so much human suffering yet never skips a beat in her sputtering naivety.  Her rendition of `New York, New York' is haunting, but there is so much more to her performance than a mere song.  You can strip the layers from her and find a woman masking so much pain with a song and a dance.  These are two of the bravest performances in recent years.

McQueen found a way to make this addiction feel real to the audience, and in doing so he helped open our eyes to the fact that life is much deeper than it may seem.  Brandon's spiral to self-destruction is rendered with such detail that one is touched deeply by it.  Watching him struggle to make a real connection with someone (his failure to perform says so much about the hold the addiction has on him and the root cause of that addiction) or watching Sissy plead for love with tearful desperation is hard to stomach at times but expertly used to address the themes at hand.

Yes, I understand that some have balked at the depiction of the gay-club and the fact that it is depicted as a mortal sin of sorts, but I think that taken into context it makes sense in a way, considering that the addiction has brought Brandon to a place he never expected it to.

Regardless of any small quibbles (which I have none), there is no denying the power behind each and every frame.",1343088000,4,3598,4.58528951486698

4960050,5,B006512BFU,"We are all a bit nutty in our own way.  Michael Fassbender's character lives the life that many modern men would think is spectacular.  He is free from emotional attachments.  He has no wife, nor does he want one.  This is the story of a man who leads a solitary existence in New York City.  He should be very, very happy.  He's good looking, has a high paying job, and a nice apartment.  His free time and work time is mainly spent watching pornography on the internet, having prostitutes over, and chasing down women in bars.  He is very good at meeting and seducing women, but it usually doesn't go beyond a tryst in an alleyway.  It becomes painfully obvious that he has a sexual addiction.

His sister, who is a very flawed character in her own way, comes to stay with him because she has nowhere else to go.  She's an aspiring singer.  Fassbender's character loves his sister, but cannot communicate with her and blames her for infringing upon his sterile, emotionless existence.  Watching this man, is like watching a tiger in a cage.  He is very intense, but also trapped in the same patterns.  He wants desperately to connect with his sister, but only ends up raging on her.  In a sense, he sees in his sister all of the women he has used and tossed away, because during the course of the film it is apparent that she has been used by men and tossed by the wayside.  He sees the effect this has on her, but never talks to her about it.  He is a perfect individual in his own eyes.  From the outside looking in, you see that he is terribly lonely, depressed, speeding towards some sort of doom.  The only time he feels an emotional connection with a woman, he cannot perform sexually.

I highly recommend this film to men especially, who think that womanizing is a fine way to spend your time.  It has forced me to think about my own behaviors.  Anything that makes you think like that, without preaching or telling a morality tale in an obvious manner, constitutes art.",1341964800,5,1978,4.4484679665738165

4960055,2,B006512BFU,"This movie didn't know if it wanted to be a melodrama or a porno flick.  It started off intriguing enough--a man with a serious sexual addiction that may lead to his undoing, but it ended up as just an idea.  We learn nothing about the man, or the problem that led to his being an addict or the fact that he can't seem to connect with women unless it's a one-night stand or they're women of the night.  Then when his sister enters the picture (and we know from her telephone calls that she's a problem) there's so much dysfunctional sexual tension between them that if it wasn't for the fact that they're actors playing the roles of siblings, it would be liable to creep you out.  And again, we learn nothing about their relationship, or why there's the heightened tension.  At one point he complains about always having to be her savior, but that simply isn't enough for the amount of tension in this film.

If you want to see a lot of Fassbender's rump or member (which I'm sure was a prop) then rent away.  But this film is slow, and adding gratuitous sex scenes doesn't make it better.  And having the camera linger 45 seconds on a face (I counted) doesn't amp up the drama, it simply drags the film out.

The trailer makes this film look a lot better than it is.  There is a reason this film don't go mainstream.  Next time I will wait until more than 23 people review a film.",1340236800,3,1381,4.313953488372093

Even more so, let me pay its creator the ultimate compliment: if I could get films of my novels made I'd want McQueen to direct them. Shame is great art, and hopefully it will do for the NC-17 rating what Midnight Cowboy did for its predecessor X rating- earn some major Oscar nominations and damn the puerile American film ratings system for good. Another plus it bears is, given that the whole cast, save for Marianne, is white, and set in America, that this film reaches such heights, directed by a black Brit, making it all the more remarkable, and a good herald for a time when, hopefully, in a few decades, critics like me won't even have to mention such things, for, Steve McQueen shares far less in common with hack filmmakers of all backgrounds, especially black hacks like Spike Lee, and for that little bit of heaven I can only end this review as I started it.",1340236800,2,1228,4.586363636363636

The subject matter is definitely 'adult' and not for some of the repressed masses here in the U.S. but if you look past the sex scenes... think of Brandons computer (this won't give too much away) the director is pointing out the high risk behaviors that our main character takes. It's part of the outcome of someone who may have been abused in some way as a child.. If you've watched this you'll recall Cissy's line about where they come from; that is our only hint at their shared darkness.

My mind was in overdrive making up all sorts or scenarios for how these characters ended up so screwed up. The film score was haunting and the acting was superb. Loved the way it was shot. Steve McQueen really made this film seem like I was spying on someone's private life.

Something breathtaking in the movie was the rendition of ""New York, New York"" sung by Carey Mulligan. I don't know if she really sang the song or not, but wow, what an incredible and poignant rendition.

This is not a movie to take lightly, and it shows the brutal reality of what can happen to you when you let things in your life get out-of-control. Will you be able to stop them? Most people never know if they can until it's too late.

4960073,2,B006512BFU,"I had not heard about this film and so came to it without expectation.  The film begins with a cool, stylistic and indeed hypnotic ambience which is at once gripping and intriguing.  We are introduced to the main character, a sex addict who is at first portrayed as a charismatic, sexually alluring New York exec, a roving lothario with erything going for him.  So far so good.  The film leads you subtly onwards, into the character; the feel of the film is icy, detached, a hint perhaps at the interior world of Fassbender's character.  There is a scene early on in the film when Brandon is out with his boss and some other colleagues in a bar drinking hard and in obvious pursuit of women.  Fassbender's boss is loud, obnoxious and moronic, whereas Fassbender is contrasted as cool and controlled.  His boss spots a group of single women drinking at the bar and decides to make his move, and as he struts over Fassbender remarks that he bets that he messes it up.  Indeed his chat-up style is cringing if not totally confident, but he does gradually begin to win the women over to him per force.  As they prepare themselves for some tequila shots Fassbender sidles up and joins in.  He says little and drinks, yet he appears to intrigue one of the women, who gives him the eye while she dances with his idiotic boss.  The eveining fizzles out and Fassbender puts his dejected boss into a cab before walking home.  On his journey a car pulls up and offers him a lift and he jumps in.  It was the woman from the bar and in the next scene he's thrusting into her against a wall in the street.  For me this is where the film ends.  You realise that he says little not because he is the silent mysterious type but because he has nothing to say, his boss is atleast human.  The abject misery, shame and lonliness of sex addiction is well put but sadly the film is as empty and meaningless as the character is portrays.  It is gratiutous and without redemption.",1339372800,3,1956,4.434173669467787

4960075,4,B006512BFU,"*  Some Spoilers *

The conversation in the weeks leading up to the release of Steve McQueen's film usually were about the amount of sex in the film or about the size of Michael Fassbender's privates.  There's no build up to either of these in the film; McQueen puts them front and center of the film's opening scenes, as if to say, ""Here ya go.  Happy?  Can we get on with it?""
There are quite a few sex scenes but they are anything but erotic and this is how Brandon feels.  He never seems to enjoy the fact that he's able to sleep with all these women (His boss tries to pick up a blonde at an upscale lounge but fails miserably; Brandon takes said blonde to a secluded spot for some one-on-one time).  His past, alluded to by his needy sister (an equally ravaged soul), has scarred him to the point where he doesn't seem to revel in any sort of postcoital bliss.
He asks a co-worker out on a date and you expect a guy who's smooth and charming.  The date is a bit awkward, even by first date standards.  He admits his longest relationship lasted about 4 months.  When he finally gets her in a hotel room, he can't perform.  Though he has only gone out with her once, Brandon finds himself unable to sleep with her and brush her off.  He later gets another woman into the room and is able to find release.
The key scene involves Brandon and his lecherous boss (played by James Badge Dale) going to see Brandon's sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan) sing at a bar.  She sings a haunting rendition of the theme from ""New York, New York.""  The ache in her voice reverberates through Brandon, who tears up; his boss thinks it's because his sister is so talented, not realizing that it's because the lyrics describe that need to rise above one's circumstances that is at the core of the Sullivan's siblings shattered psyches.
""Shame"" explores Brandon's inability to make any real connections with others, as well as with his own self.

There is a sort of artsy switch between the majority of the film, which is shot in bleak, dark, harsh colors - and scenes of sexual encounters which are shot in colors of warmth, possibly through a filter which gives emphasis to that.
  The story being told is sad, very sad.  Bleak.  Hopeless.  Irreparable.  Another reviewer said that the elephant in the room is the untold story of how these people came to be this way.  If that is the case (and I have no problem with that interpretation), then the point of the film must be the horrific lifelong effects of such things.  I spent the last third of the film considering the question of whether these people would be better off dead.  Ultimately, the writer reveals a similar train of thought.  The people in the world who are in such a state seem to be beyond the reach of sympathy, pity, or attempts to give help.  The tone of the film is oppressively disheartening.

4960084,2,B006512BFU,"Shame is THE definitive sexual addiction film, and Michael Fassbinder's portrait of a sex addict is unlikely to be bettered by another actor any time soon. All that media buzz around him is all true. His performance is one of the more brilliant any of us is likely to see in the movies.  While Carey Mulligan struggles extravagantly to hold her own as his pathologically messed up pain-in-the-ass sister, it remains Michael Fassbinder's picture from first shot through last frame.

The essence of sexual addiction is an inability to find satisfaction, those few moments of post-orgasmic repose that allow--however briefly--a fleeting balm of peace with ourselves and a temporary truce with the world to settle around us, and just for right now, for everything to be o.k.  Ay, there's the rub. Shame perfectly captures the relentless, desperate yearning for just a breath or two of minuscule relief, the micro-timeout, that never, ever arrives. Godot has already come and long since blown this scene.

There is the possibility that in your life, you've not yet had the occasion to ponder the hell realm of sexual--or of any flavor, for that matter--addiction. In which case, this could be fascinating unknown territory for you to explore. But if you've already experienced a glimpse of absolute despair, there's really no need to sumerge yourself in a 100 minute cinematic buzz-kill that goes absolutely nowhere, no matter how artfully it is rendered.

There is also a surfeit of dark New York streets punctuated by the angst of lost subway lust. The neo-noir textures could not feel more authentic.

Oh!  Right.  About all the nudity.  Should the mild titillation of semi-soft-core full frontal hold some attraction, this is the wrong place to look for gratification.  Sure, there's plenty of skin and the bodies are all nice enough, but it's 180 opposite from a turn-on. Unless, that is, you are of the more kinked persuasion, say the sort who appreciates a cinma veriti-style shot of a buck naked Fassbinder's backside as he pisses into his own toilet without bothering to raise the seat (Yes, his sister is staying in his apartment at the time.

If our favorite self-loathing, vain American Psycho and his self-abusive little sister had all of the sexual hang-ups of Rodger Dodger (2002) then we'd have Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class, Haywire) and Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Drive) from Shame.

Brandon (Fassbender) is a NYC exec with an ostentatiously modern, white, sterile condo and a serious sex addiction.  He ever so casually saunters high society lounges and effortless finds company for the evening.  But that doesn't seem to be enough to quench his deep-seeded thirst for--something.  On a daily basis his only smiles are elicited by flirtations or discussions thereof with his partner in crime, his boss.

Brandon apathetically ignores his sister's routine calls until one day he comes home to find that she, Sissy (Mulligan), has dropped in unannounced.  This turns into an uncomfortable, family-valueless argument during which Sissy is naked.  She makes no effort to cover up nor does Brandon try to avert his eyes.  They bicker like participants in an unhealthy marriage, which sets the stage for their even more unhealthy relationship as brother and sister.  At this point we can imagine that they've been through something serious together and that they, at some point, strongly depended on one another.  We can also imagine that moral lines may have been crossed.

Working a few gigs as a lounge singer, Sissy draws the attention of Brandon's business cohort.  Their affections clearly displease Brandon.  In fact, it incites frustration, resentment, enmity and rage.  Masturbation, full frontal nudity, intense sexual tension and a brilliantly tactful score make this film all about a tone of depravity.  You never quite feel comfortable watching this film, yet you need to know where it's going and why Brandon and Sissy are the way that they are.  Keeping in tune with American Psycho, Brandon has an addiction to pornography and an often cold demeanor that accompany him even in the workplace.

On another note, I can't help but to wonder if the man cast as Brandon's waiter (during a date scene) wasn't cast because he looked like a very American Psycho Christian Bale.  The waiter has a surprising among of dialogue, all somewhat humorous, and all interrupting a scene designed to demonstrate that Brandon is romantically challenged and generally disconnected.

As Brandon becomes ever more removed from emotionally connecting with anyone else, his sister included, the sexuality becomes rather intense, more frequent and, for some, perhaps difficult to watch.  This film probably won't make you laugh or cry, nor will it lead you to anything resembling catharsis.  It will, however, impress you with the cast's ability to take on this intense--I dare not call it a story--series of scenes.  The character development is unsubtle, but impressive, and the characters may first be considered hyperboles, but they are nothing short of being a little too real for comfort.

Fassbender could possibly be a much underated talent in the waiting; his other roles were solid, however, SHAME is probably his most complex role to date. It truly took courage and talent to pull off such a complicated character. The main topic which is explored here is sexual addiction, and it's damaging effects within and without the soul of an individual. The director truly went dark with this tale, there is a lot of nudity and promiscuity, hence the NC-17 rating; but don't be turned off by the rating, this film is not about sexual exploits, it explores sexual addiction, and delivers a great movie. Sexual addiction is serious, and it can be just as destructive as other addictions such as; alcohol, drugs, etc. Again, Micheal Fassbender does a convincingly dynamic job of delivering a struggling, tortured soul.

4960090,5,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" shocked and moved me.  For such a slow-paced movie, it blew me away as million-dollar special effects never could.  Tender and heartfelt yet unrelenting in its brutality, this movie presents something new and real at every turn.

Sissy is shallow and flighty, a failing singer who comes to New York to stay with her brother, the cool and controlled business professional.  From the beginning, we know something is awry.  Brandon and Sissy throw themselves at each other and break away screaming, they love and despise each other intensely.  Also, Brandon's addiction to sex is rather hard to hide.  Sissy's arrival plunges him into a downward spiral from which the viewer is not spared.  His endless bouts of sex are as off-putting to Brandon as they are to us; like any addict, he has lost all sense of joy or fulfillment in his vice long ago.  He no longer has any choice.

Do Sissy and Brandon have an incestuous past?  What about their parents?  As Sissy says, ""We're not bad people.  We just come from a bad place.""  Their past is veiled in dark, ugly shadows.  Like every great movie, ""Shame"" is open to many interpretations and raises far more questions than it answers.

For such an ugly subject matter, ""Shame"" is truly beautiful.  On a final note, as a heterosexual female moviegoer I am glad-- after years and years of actresses going topless for no reason at all-- that a movie finally has the courage to show full-frontal male nudity.",1337472000,4,1455,4.733067729083666

 1st of all I would like to say I'm a huge Michael Fassbender fan. HUGE!I was so exited to see this film and I just viewed it and now I am so glad I didn't purchase it as I intended to do without seeing it. He is an excellant actor no doubt and he did all that he could do with what was offered but I still found the film wanting. I get that he is a sex addict I knew all about what the film was supposed to be about and I have seen the trailers. I did empathize with Fassbender's character and I get that this is a real problem for many people and it isn't their fault. I think what annoyed me the most was Mulligan's character,Sissy. I found her character SO unsympathetic!!! And at the end SOOO predictable! I could see the insinuation that there was some kind of troubled past for them but for her to just barge in on his life with no warning,leave him no privacy and screw his married boss practically the moment she arrives I would want to throw her butt to the curb as well!!!I didn't blame Brandon 1 bit for being beyond pissed off!!And then her saying that she was trying to help him!! HOW??By being a prat??!!!She didn't commit ONE unselfish act while she was in his home NOT A ONE!!Yes! She is a parasite! Lord she was irritating! I hated her! And then what she did at the end was even more selfish{typical her} and predictable!!!That is one of the reasons I hated this film. I expected to be blown away but was sadly dissapoited. Oh and as far as her singing also very unimpressed. I'm afraid it would take quite a bit more talent to be booked at a N.Y. club.{She must have diddled the club owner as well as Brandon's boss.}So that as well is not believeable. I guess the last scene insinuates because of her neediness and that act that she commited that he is possibly changing?All I can say is I only wish she finished the job!!{And not the REAL actress mind you I usually love her roles and she is fab. She didn't write this script.}On a good note I loved Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds and even more in Eden Lake although that was hard to watch.

Skip it.",1337040000,5,405,4.36
4960094,1,B006512BFU,"Perhaps I've grown a bit jaded over the years. At 54 years old I've seen all sorts of movies. I've seen everything from low budget movies that were impressive to high budget movies that were terrible and the other way round. I've seen movies that were supposed to be great that I hated and movies that were supposed to be terrible that I loved. I've seen movies that were supposed to be high brow dramas that I agreed with. And then I've seen movies like this one that had all the trappings of high brow intellectual crap that critics love to meander over that in truth were nothing less than boring.

Michael Fassbender stars as Brandon, a young executive on the rise. Things seem to be going well for him professionally but personally not much so. Brandon is a character lacking something in his life. For the most part he has little if no love life going for him. At the same time, his sex life is exploding. Brandon is a sex addict of sorts. If he's not paying some high priced call girl for her time, he's surfing sex sites online or having sex conversations there as well. Personally his life is a mess.

If this weren't bad enough, Brandon's sister enters his life as well. Sissy is another totally messed up individual. Having been through many men in the hopes of finding the right one, she always seems to pick the losers. After a recent split she asks if she can stay at his place for a while. He relents and she invites him to see her perform at a local club. He finds it hard to believe she's found work but is stunned when she does well.

So now you have the set up of the story. And honestly it doesn't go much further than this. Each character's interaction with each other and Brandon's interaction with a woman he is attracted to despite his emotional problems make for the gist of the film. Long conversations that lead no where, revelations that aren't surprising and the lack of a character to feel sorry for, to sympathize with, make this one long boring film.

As I said earlier, there are films that critics love to praise with pseudo-intellectual clap trap, discussing the symbolism of what the director intended or how the actors were able to display intensity with a subtle nuance. More often than not when I've read reviews like this it tells me the critic was more interested in appearing to be in touch with the art crowd than writing an honest review that said either this is crap or I didn't get what the point was here.

For me with the amount of movies out there to watch, with the good, the bad and the ugly available either via Netflix, Redbox or the local store, I don't understand why anyone would waste time with something like this. To me it felt like time wasted that I can never recover. With the cost of a movie ticket or to purchase a DVD one has to wonder why anyone would consider something like this to be worth the amount of money they expect us to pay for it. Then again there are so many pretentious people in the world who want to make it seem as if they are so far above the fray that I'm sure this movie will at least make it's money back and cause another investor to put money into more films like it.

But there was no digital copy. In spite of the front cover and the information on the Amazon web page, digital copies are not available for Apple devices (iPad, iPhone, iTunes, etc).  You will have to pay an additional $15 to iTunes to get the promised digital copy.

When I complained to Fox I was told I was not deceived because there was a tiny green box on the back that said Android Market.  I needed a magnifying glass to read it; there was something above 'Android Market' but it was too small to actually print.  There is a larger graphic on the back that is the same as the one they use for digital copies that can be used by Apple products and that graphic includes a iPhone!

[The software on their DVD used to download digital copies with a Mac is actually there and loads--it just won't download for Apple products!  So it took me a while to figure out I wasn't doing anything wrong and that my computer was ok.]

Even if there were a visible label, 'Android Market', it would not mean Apple products are not supported.  And nowhere on the box does it state that Apple products are not supported.  They were supported in the past and there is that picture of an iPhone.

Obviously, there is no way to read the green box if you buy Blu-Ray's at Amazon or any other mail order source.  Or if you shop in brick & mortar stores without a magnifying glass.  Beware of future Fox' digital copies.  It would probably be a good idea to call Amazon or Fox to find out what is included in the package.

The film gets 4 stars;  the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy package gets no stars at all.  I paid for but did not receive a digital copy.

4960098,2,B006512BFU,"With the exception of copious amounts of nudity, there's nothing particularly visual about this film and given that most of the drama is internalized for the characters, the material lends itself to a play much more than a film. The writers struggle with where to locate scenes - an endless series of 'talking heads' pieces are set in restaurants, bars, offices and literally any of the locations are interchangeable because this is a dialog driven movie. And there's really not much dialog.

Rarely the fan of 5-minute camera shots with zero editing and long stares that rely on the audience to work out the narrative, I find it hard to recommend a story that truly has no plot. The hero is an sex-addicted sketch of a character who can mysteriously stare any woman into bed. His sister sings dreadful depressing songs in bars that would drive any sober clients away and anyone intoxicated towards jumping off the nearest high building. There a strong hint of incest in their past but nothing in their history is ever shown so you have to conclude:

- The sister started an incestuous relationship that pushed the brother into a life of meaningless one-night stands.
- The brother started an incestuous relationship that destroyed the sister's subsequent romantic relationships and the brother is so ashamed he can no longer have meaningful relationships.
- The sister wants to start a relationship with her brother.
- None of the above and these two people just need some therapy.

The whole setup had the capacity to deliver an interesting story but its a damp squib and instead I have to watch Michael Fassbender walking around naked and going to the bathroom. In terms of the editing, or lack of, there are countless scenes that just go on forever with no sense of pacing whatsoever, including:

- A 5-minute performance by Carey Mulligan of ""New York, New York"".
- A multi-minute jogging sequence through the city, which is also incredibly poorly lit.
- A torturous single-cut restaurant scene that could have come straight out of a first year film school project. (Remember the screenplay rule of avoiding scenes in restaurants?)

The other weird thing is that the accents are all over the place. Anyway, there is something to the idea of the movie but it's not in final draft format and would have been more suited to a play. In terms of a review, there's not a single person in my circle of friends or family who would enjoy this, and the only reason my wife didn't stop half way through was because I'd hidden the remote.",1336262400,5,2531,4.769406392694064

However, when it comes to the story, I haven't seen such a dull piece of emo tripe since the first ""Twilight"" movie. Seriously. Every one of the characters in this mellow drama [sic] just needs a serious dose of MAOI inhibitors combined with a regular regimen of full spectrum lighting.

Again, let me iterate that the performances were amazing, but the writer/director needs to take more ""B"" vitamins and stop writing such dull, self-serving scripts.",1336089600,,638,4.844036697247707
4960101,4,B006512BFU,"I don't think anyone could say they enjoyed this movie.  It is so bleak that I doubt that is possible.  However, I believe this is the first film to really show us sexual addiction and what a grim state it is to be a sexual addict.  Michael Fassbinder does a tour de force job in the lead role.  He performs graphic sex throughout the movie and, but for the moment of release, is in pretty much a state of despair throughout it. Probably no one has had so much sex with so many partners and achieved so little satisfaction from it.  The movie at no point presents a rehab moment to soften its punch either.  This shows you the disease, not the cure, if there even is one.

Carey Mulligan plays his sister who is adrift too but more in the way of where she is in life and her lack of prospects.  She does realize that one should want a relationship and friends which our lead does not. Ironically, he leads the most sterile existence it is possible to lead.  He goes from his blue tinged gray office to his blue tinged gray apartment.  He does his work at work and at home he does his sex, watches cartoons, eats or sleeps.  He has absolutely no interest in anything else. He can barely carry on a conversation which does not veer into sex.  When he tries to have a real date with a woman who is not a prostitute, it is a catastrophe.  He only can carry on with prostitutes or the female equivalents of himself, mainly married women on the prowl.

This is well written, well directed, superbly acted BUT is stark and grim.  So if you are looking for a nice way to relax after work over a movie, I doubt this will fit the bill. I would be very surprised if you even considered the graphic content as capable of taking you out of the grim state of the film.  I can see why critics loved this film though and also why it was up for awards.

Added to that, the part where our main character metaphorically and literally crosses the street to have (shame of shames!) sex with another man because he's so desperate for sex (complete with swelling score to underline his depravity) is nothing less than backhanded homophobia - not to mention just plain lazy storytelling.

I have always loved complex characters and films that takes their time to develop them. Although its pretty clear the lead character is somewhat of a player who lives a yuppie lifestyle, it will ultimately dawn on you that this is a deeply flawed individual with sex addiction who is left unchecked and unrestrained in his desires which the film very tactfully avoids being to obvious about until towards the end.

In recent years, we can see these new genre of darker films emerging where leads are no longer required to be likable or even perfect. I wouldn't even define it as an ""anti heroe"" movie.

Some films you watch for its story and some films you watch for its beauty, for me its defintely the latter where great modern camera work can be seen in every scene of the film with great play on colors, bokeh and movement in the shots.

4960108,4,B006512BFU,"Back when I watched Hunger, I recall being extremely moved by both the subject matter and the tragically beautiful imagery from director Steve McQueen. For his second feature, McQueen again tackles a controversial subject and relies on the use images and feelings to capture it.

McQueen wisely uses his star from Hunger in Shame. Michael Fassbender plays Brandon, a successful and attractive New Yorker struggling with sex addiction. What I loved about Fassbender in Hunger was that he really was able to evoke so much feeling without having to speak, something not many actors can do well. In Shame he is able to achieve the same effect, with each look conveying a multitude of emotions.

The character of Brandon lives a fairly routine life. Apart from his seemingly successful career and a normal social life involving having drinks at upscale cocktail bars, we're shown a more up-close look at his life of a sex addict, a darker side that he shields off from the outside world. He masturbates frequently, constantly looks at pornography, and has sex with girls from the bar to call-girls. While parts of that may sound like the life of an oversexed college student, here it's anything but funny or glorified.

Brandon's routine is disrupted when he's paid an unexpected (and unwanted) visit from his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). From the moment Brandon plays and ignores messages on his answering machine from Sissy to her arrival in his apartment, we wonder why he's so heartless towards his sister. As the film progresses, there are hints that they have experienced painful childhoods, though nothing more is ever revealed.

The dysfunctional relationship of Sissy and Brandon is a puzzling one, which leaves us wanting to know more. Every interaction they have, whether it be a look across a room or an uncomfortable heated exchange with a naked Brandon on top of Sissy, we can tell there's a lot to know. The two actors do a great job of keeping the drama believable and McQueen does an equally great job of not spelling things out for us while keeping things interesting.

Brandon also meets a woman named Marianne (Nicole Beharie) who causes an additional a stir in Brandon's life. She seems different than his usual encounters. Is he capable of a real relationship? This is one of many questions I asked myself. Between Sissy and Marianne, Brandon finds himself facing some personal dilemmas that we gather he's not at all used to. The ensuing drama had me feeling all sorts of emotions, but by the end I did begin to feel a little bit of hope.

Most people will be talking about this film for its graphic sex scenes, but the film really is first and foremost a psychological drama. Brandon is a very enigmatic and fascinating character whose every action has our attention. Initially, he kind of seems like a mere pervert, but as the film progresses I really started to realize and try to understand his disease. Sex addiction is often joked about, but if there are people like Brandon out there, I think it's something that deserves to be taken seriously.

In addition to being psychologically stimulating material, Shame is also superbly crafted in such a way that each scene captures the essence of the characters and their moods. Much like Hunger, Shame doesn't just look pretty, but the gorgeous shots also say something about each scene. From a simple back-and-forth scene with Brandon and Sissy while Sissy sings in a restaurant, to a tracking shot with Brandon running, I felt closer to the characters without them having to even do much of anything.

Shame does for erotica what Drive did for car movies. While Shame has some otherwise steamy sex scenes, in context they're rather not sexy at all. The film is about more than the sex, Shame is a character study about a man and his internal struggles. To simply write this film off as an erotic escapade would be unfortunate. While the film is often difficult to watch and leaves us with more questions than answers, it's a fascinating drama with a lot to appreciate.

4960109,3,B006512BFU,"This film is visually good, many scenes in Manhattan, especially those shot outside, in the streets and subway, are very powerful and charged with emotion because of masterful use of color and scenery. On the other hand, sexual scenes are dull and somewhat boring (maybe this is intentional, I'm not sure).

Sometimes, though, visual effects are overdone, as in the scene of Sissy's suicide attempt: all this bright red blood on bright white walls and floor looks artificial, shown just to make strong impression on the viewer.

Otherwise this is a rather average movie, the plot isn't too convincing, Brandon's ""sexual addiction"" doesn't seem to be getting that much in the way of his life, and his failure to help his sister should be attributed more to his general callousness; to be fair, her situation requires more support and effort than an average person can easily provide.

The Fassbender's performance in this film I find rather wooden (maybe this is intentional too though). I liked Carey Mulligan very much in An Education, but in this movie I don't find her as good. I attribute this mostly to the character she plays, which is not developed enough to be convincing. The best performed role, to my taste, is that played by Mari-Ange Ramirez. Yes, it's a secondary role, one episode, really, but somehow her play is very convincing and appealing.

I'd like to repeat: McQueen, to my perception, failed to show (or I failed to see) convincingly Brandon's sex addiction. Prostitutes? Pornography? Masturbation? Homoerotic acts? But, sorry for asking, is there anybody left who's not doing this, and that, and that - full time including his time in the [Oval] office? Senators, governors, any and every public figure is involved in adultery, exhibitionism, just name it. President's security detail - being on duty - are involved in prostitution scandal in Colombia.

So why is an average guy supposed to be any different? Why Brandon's ""addiction"" is any worse than what's shown in Sex and the City, or the Babysitters - I fail to understand. The media is so saturated with sexually suggestive imagery that Brandon's lifestyle looks fairly innocent.

All in all, this movie is rather average. I watched it to the very end though - meaning it's not that bad.

One last note: being a Steve McQueen The Second, maybe you could pick some nice nom de plume.",1335312000,2,2363,4.922110552763819

And I really don't appreciate Fox dangling me on for a week when they obviously never intended to give an iTunes copy.

4960111,5,B006512BFU,"Shame is a difficult movie to rate or review because of the nature of the film. Many people may shy away from this great film due to the NC-17 rating and all the nudity. This movie is about a man (Michael Fassbender) who lives in NYC who appears to have a normal life to most, however he is a sex addict. He is the protagonist of our story, however throughout the film we are not sure if we really like this guy or not. He sees multiple women and retires to the bathroom at work daily to ""relive some pressure"". He has a very neat, scheduled, clean, organized life and has managed to control his urges the best he can.

His life gets turned upside-down when his sister (Carey Mulligan) drops in on him and asks to live with him for a while. She causes a hiccup in his daily routine and his neat clean little world.

The acting is brilliant. Fassbender is remarkable and gives a true deep performance. Mulligan also was outstanding, and in my opinion both actors are at the top of their game in this film. The interactions, dialogue and situations they are introduced to, are perfectly documented by the brilliant directing and classic, yet clean modern cinematography. Most of the scenes run very long with no cuts. It is a very raw film and wonderfully portrayed to the audience.

The PQ & AQ are pristine and could not get any better. I blind bought this film after hearing so many good things about it. It is dark, it is sexual, however it is about the emptiness of a man who may seem he has it together, yet is very lost. I highly recommend this film to fans of underground, indie, or non-mainstream movies. It is not a movie I will watch very often, however the characters and the depth of the acting will bring me back for multiple viewings in the future.",1335225600,5,1761,4.379204892966361
4960112,3,B006512BFU,"This film got rave reviews, but really, it was quite boring.  I actually fast-forwarded through several scenes once I had a feel for the directing and realized that some of the scenes were insufferably over-long.",1335139200,,212,5.057142857142857
4960113,4,B006512BFU,"Remember all those Cecil B. DeMille biblical epics in which CB graphically illustrated the sins he was supposed to be condemning? This film takes a similar approach. The moral is clear. Sex addiction is bad. It is a form of spiritual death. And just to make sure you get the point, we are going to let you spend two hours staring at Michael Fassbender's naked quivering backside as he penetrates a succession of nubile young women. As a cure for sex addiction, it needs work.

Don't get me wrong. The film is extremely well made. Fassbender is a compelling, eminently watchable actor. Even when he has his clothes on. But several scenes in the film are nothing short of pornographic. If this is the antidote to sex addition, then Jack Daniels is a cure for alcoholism.",1335052800,,768,4.647058823529412
4960114,4,B006512BFU,"""Shame"" features a pair of stunning performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carey Mulligan as a damaged brother and sister with their own way of coping with emotional damage. So why not five stars? Although I liked this movie quite a bit especially Fassbinger's amazing performance (no pun intended), it's not something I would watch more than once or twice. ""Shame"" is both a powerful and harrowing experience and it's not something I'm likely to return to simply for entertainment value although co-writer and director Steve McQueen creates an amazingly powerful minimalist drama.

SPOILERS:

Fassbinger plays Brandon a sex addict who's life is turned upside down by the unexpected arrival of his sister Sissy (Mulligan)who has issues of her own. Brandon is unable to connect emotionally with anyone and uses sex to feel...anything with anyone.

END OF SPOILERS:

A graphic and emotionally powerful film ""Shame"" won't be for everyone (be warned that there is quite a bit of nudity in the film and scenes where the characters are--not surprisingly--having sex). Fassinberg gives a stunning performance making Brandon surprisingly likeable and appealing despite his cold, disconnected nature. It's clear why woman like him--he's charming and notices small details about them but it's also clear that even though Brandon wouldn't admit it, he has a self loathing which prevents him from developing any sort of relationship with anyone beyond the purely physical (and even then only for one night stands).

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with a nice audio mix although most of the activity is in the front speakers (there is a fair amount of ambient activity in the rear).

The special features (if it matters to you)are limited to a series of brief featurettes.

""Focus on Michael Fassbender"",  ""Director Steve McQueen"",""The Story of Shame"", ""In A Shared Vision"", "" Fox Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Michael Fassbender"" and film's theatrical trailer (1:47/HD) as well as previews. Most of the featurettes run around 3 minutes or so. A commentary track by the director and actors would have been interesting and welcome.

There's also a digital copy (Edit: This film is available on itunes to buy) as well as DVD.

I'd suggest renting rather ""Shame"" first before making the committment to buy it and see if it is your type of movie (and to see if it's one you'll want to watch more than one time). The film deserved much of its praise and director McQueen's stark, minimalist direction compliments the direct performances in the film.",1335052800,2,2552,5.142512077294686
4960115,2,B006512BFU,"While the actors were brilliant, the scenes themselves were too long and drawn out...almost to the point of making me want to get up for something to eat or drink.  Too slow-paced.

In addition, I found a specific part or two to be a bit unrealistic.  I'm very close friends with a sex addict.  It's as if this film wants audiences to believe something tragic will cause pause in the sex addict's behavior.  I personally haven't found this to be the case whatsoever.

Michael Fassbender and his member are marvelous in their roles, giving incredible performances...but this movie just doesn't live up to the hype.",1335052800,,613,4.79047619047619

4960117,5,B006512BFU,"This movie portrays life in New York City as an enormously empty place, empty in terms of meaning and personal connections.  The protagonist played wonderfully by Michael Fassbender, walks around almost like a wolf looking to find a mating partner for the moment.  He stares women down on the train.  When he does try to make intimate contact with a coworker, he ends up being sadly impotent.  This was hard to see, but gave me insight into his need to troll endlessly looking for human connection.  His sister is a fair to middling singer with deep wounds that are transparent and manifested by self destructive and suicidal behavior.  The missing link I see in the movie, and I could be wrong, is that the siblings had at one point in their life, an incestuous relationship, that she wants to continue but he does not.  Instead he seeks to clean himself with annonymous sexual liaisons. I think that the brother being offended by his sister's sexual encounter with his boss helps to strengthen this hypothesis.  He cringes like a child listening to their connective noises, and has to go out to jog while they finish.  The glare of graphic sexual encounters is necessary in a way to contrast to their otherwise meaningless lives, and I did not find it to be offensive. Neither party is willing or able to confront their demons.

Overall I found this movie to be provocative and is on my mind days after seeing it.  I think it is worthwhile to watch.  We all have some demons that we act out in one way or another.",1334966400,3,1515,4.591078066914498

That is not to say it doesn't hold your interest, but there is quite a bit of repetition here. Start with a dysfunctional brother and sister combo, add lots of meaningless, empty sex, an inability to achieve true intimacy with others and an implied past incestuous relationship which sort of explains all the dysfunction.

Rinse, repeat, add a failed suicide attempt for good measure, the end. One gets the impression these 2 had quite a troubled childhood. One scene that stood out for me as a great example of the excessive nature of this film is an agonizing, long, boring, rendition of ""New York, New York"" delivered by the lead actress. Not a bad voice but we understand the irony of the performance almost immediately but it seems to go on for another 5 minutes beyond that.",1334880000,4,869,4.6797385620915035

Really annoying for MAC users, especially since the code insert gives misleading instructions for MAC transference. I called the 1-800 number on the blu ray case, and the Fox Digital customer service representative told me it was a ""title"" issue (not sure what that means) and put me on a waiting list to be contacted when the problem is resolved. I did ask them if the digital copy was unavailable on MAC platform because of legal issues between Fox and Apple, and the representative firmly denied it -- but who knows?

Although I am happy to have this movie on blu-ray, I find that Fox's actions are pretty deplorable and misleading. Lesson learned.

It just seems to me when it comes to hollywood when ever its a interracial couple they never want to fully go there you know famous white male and a lesser known black actress we can,t have none of that it may upset the masses. I know ppl will dissagree its ok its just my opinion and another thing the interaction between him and his sister was irritating yes I said irritaing I know what happens to her at the end but irritating none the less.so there you have it please don,t allow my opinion in anyway stop you from seeing this film it does after all shed some light on sexual addiction. blur-ray is the only way the quality is amazing almost too clear and real!",1334793600,,1251,4.152263374485597
4960123,5,B006512BFU,"SHAME  is a brilliant, courageous, visually and emotionally stunning film by a new team of collaborators - director/writer Steve McQueen, cinematographer Sean Babbitt, and actor Michael Fassbender first gave us the unforgettable HUNGER and now they have teamed to present yet another unique work that will likely go down as one of the finest films of the decade.  Abi Morgan (The Hours television series, The Iron Lady, Tsunami, Sex Traffic) co wrote the screenplay with McQueen; they seem to have an affinity for each other.  This film has been controversial from the first mention that it was being made and controversy usually means that people are reacting strongly (both positively and negatively) to an art work - the true indication that this is by definition Art.

The extraordinarily complex story of 21st century isolation and inability to connect with other people except on a unidirectional level of sexual contact is distilled in the role of Brandon (Michael Fassbender, in a multifaceted yet intensely focused performance): Brandon's life is dominated by near anonymous sexual encounters, internet pornography, and multiple daily escapes into onanism, He is quiet, handsome, and utterly irresistible to women and he takes advantage of this preoccupation with sexuality as a loner, living in an apartment, free of relationships, holding down a fine job as an account manager.  This changes when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) `moves in' and her unwanted presence alters Brandon's modus operandi. Brandon's boss, the married with children Dave (James Badge Dale) envies Brandon's way with women, always losing in his unpracticed approaches to pickups to Brandon's superior techniques.  Dave meets Sissy at a nightclub where Sissy is singing (Mulligan's rendition of Kander and Ebb's `New York, New York' was apparently shot in one take at 3 AM while cameras focuses on the three actors - genuine responses to t a deeply moving moment) and ends up sleeping with Sissy. Brandon, frustrated with Sissy's presence and behavior ultimately leads to his throwing her out of his apartment - an act that has an impactful result. Meanwhile Brandon attempts to `relate' both emotionally and physically with fellow office worker Marianne (Nicole Beharie) with embarrassing results. And in his frustration he walks the night streets having sexual encounters with multiple partners out in the open, in a gay bar, and in thwarted attempts to pickup a girl whose boyfriend beats him severely.

Much of the success of this art piece is due to the manner in which McQueen presents his story.  Many of the scenes ore simply faces on the subway and Brandon's fantasies, all accompanied by a musical score by Harry Escott who has elected to use multiple recordings of Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations and Preludes and Fugues - the sublime simplicity of Bach's statements in marked contrast to the chaos in Brandon's mind and actions. In a splendid scene as Brandon awaits a subway, when his mind is tortured and out of control cinematographer Babbitt distorts the image like an acid trip.  But most impressive is the choice to concentrate on Brandon's face as he eyes tricks or faces the world in which he lives in his out of control state  - a face so misguided and needy and yet sensuous that it makes the film draw us inside a character's psyche like few other films have been able.

Michael Fassbender does the impossible; he creates a role that despite the behavioral abnormalities remains a man about whom we care about deeply. At film's beginning there is subtle male frontal nudity and Fassbender's remarks about that are mature and enlightening: `To be honest with you again, I think it's the idea of male frontal nudity. It just baffles me: Women can parade around naked all the time, but the guy conveniently has his pants on. I remember my mom always complaining about that to me, saying, ""This is such `b-s', it's always the women who are naked"" ... so I did this one for you, Mom!  Everyone involved in this film is to be commended for the highest level of artistic achievement.  And that extends to the credits at film's end: each participant's name is flashed on the screen with a single musical chord on the piano.

In Shame, he plays Brandon, a sex addict - prostitutes, women (and one man) he picks up in bars, online sex, masturbation at work - it doesn't matter.  And it's clear that Brandon gets no relief or enjoyment from the sexual acts.  We don't know what drives him to these behaviors, but when his sister, Sissy, (played by Carey Mulligan) shows up uninvited and unwelcome, the tension between the two, Sissy's lack of boundaries with her brother, and Brandon's hostile reactions to her hint at something possibly very traumatic in their pasts.  Sissy continually reaches out to her brother, as he becomes increasingly angry with her neediness and dependency.  An argument with Sissy sends him off to find relief one evening in the one way he knows how: with a series of degrading and potentially dangerous sexual acts.  The night culminates in a threesome.  While some might think any threesome must be good, this one would change your mind.  The scene depicted here was not sexy at all and Brandon's pain (Fassbender WENT for it here) was heart-breaking to watch.

Fassbender received some international awards for this role, as well as a Golden Globe nomination.  His performance is extraordinary, as is Mulligan's.  He makes you feel the hopelessness and emptiness of Brandon.  I can't say I liked him, but I did feel sympathy for him.  And let's not forget George Clooney's salute to Fassbender's golf club-size...appendage.

And, like most people, they don't cope very well at all.

There isn't much plot in SHAME.  It's a slow-moving character study.  It's also not for everyone.  The NC-17 rating isn't much for the content (we've seen more graphic stuff in R-rated films), but for the way the content is handled: unflinchingly, without judgement, without condemnation, and perhaps with a tad bit of understanding.  Director/writer Steve McQueen makes frequent use of extended shots; this adds and aura of unease to even the film's more beautiful moments (a real-time take of Carey Mulligan singing ""New York, New York"" is most memorable).  The script is intelligent, and never belittles its characters; nor does it put them up on some pedestal of victimhood and pity.  It's simply an honest take on two incredibly realistic individuals.

None of that would be possible, of course, without the right actors.  Thankfully, both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan have proven themselves worthy of the job.  They deliver their best performances here; the bravery isn't necessarily in their willingness to bare it all before the camera, but in the off-handed way they do so.  The relationship between Brandon and Sissy is incredibly strained and at times uncomfortable; Fassbender and Mulligan don't shy away from this, but instead embrace it and swing for the fences.  These are truly award-worthy performances; the film's edgy content may have scares away the Academy Awards, but actors of this caliber don't really care.  There will be awards for Fassbender and Mulligan some day.  Right now, they give gripping, memorable performances in a film that is a must-see for anyone who appreciates quality filmmaking, and isn't afraid of stepping outside their emotional comfort zone.",1334620800,5,2042,5.217791411042945

He doesn't have many close friends, but that fits his life style. Brandon is an extreme sex addict. He lives his life how he wants until his sister Sissy (Mulligan) shows up unannounced. He does his best to hide his addiction from her, but somethings aren't that easy. First of all I have to say that this is a really good movie. That said it's not easy to watch. Fassbender is amazing in this and I have no idea why he didn't get nominated. I'm guessing because the movie is NC-17 and there is a lot of sex and nudity. That aside watching him struggle with his addiction with few words is really mesmerizing. I can compare this to ""Drive"" in the style and the pacing, few words but powerful actions. Brandon is one of the most unlikeable characters I have seen lately but the entire time you really want him to change and you end up sympathizing and identifying with Sissy through out most of the movie. Movies that polarize you like that are an adventure to watch and you seem to get more out of it. All that said I do recommend this. Overall, A great but hard movie to watch, very emotional.

I got lost in some moments as if I was parked in front of a video installation in an art museum. The subway scene and the running sequence have somehow invaded my brain and left indelible after effect images...  I hope that this stands up on second viewing on Blu Ray - or rather, I hope I can surrender to the visual rhythm and moods of Mr McQueen's film at home - and that is just the continuation of a long career of collaboration (like Kinski and Herzog) between McQueen and Fassbender - which began with ""Hunger"".",1331337600,4,908,4.503030303030303
4960132,4,B006512BFU,"In this lurid tale of sexual addiction, director and co-writer Steve McQueen teams up again with Michael Fassbender (""Hunger""). Brandon (Fassbender) is a moderately successful sales manager that outwardly appears to be just a regular single guy in Manhattan. Behind closed doors (or open windows) he can't get enough sex. If he can't get it by picking up girls, he will resort to prostitutes or internet porn. If that's inconvenient, then there's the old fashion do it yourself method. He has no interest in relationships. In the one tryst he has with a co-worker who wants something beyond sex, Brandon can't pull the trigger. There's something clearly wrong with this guy.

His life becomes complicated when his sister (Carey Mulligan in another terrific performance) shows up at his apartment uninvited. Their initial encounter when he walks in on her in the shower alerts us that something is amiss. He has an unusually long conversation with her as she stands before him in all her full frontal glory. Hmm. The siblings couldn't be more different. Brandon is almost a recluse. He socializes but only if there is a chance for sex. Sissy (Mulligan) is talkative, effervescent and looking for fun. She is a troubled soul however.

We see this initially when Brandon and his boss (James Badge Dale, TV's ""Rubicon"") go to a club where Sissy has a gig singing. In a featured scene she sings a sorrowful rendition of ""New York, New York"" that brings a tear to Brandon...and me. In another scene, Sissy cuddles up to Brandon in the middle of the night. He rightfully throws her out but why would she do that? In another scene, she says to him ""we are not bad people; we just come from a bad place."" Certainly a history of incest is suggested as the cause of their psychological damage. Unfortunately, McQueen does little to flesh out this cause and effect background.

The film is graphically presented in terms of language, nudity and sexual activity earning the NC-17 rating. The performances by Fassbender and Mulligan are special and worthy of awards.

4960134,5,B006512BFU,"Steve McQueen's sophomore feature officially solidifies the director's status as one of the greats. McQueen is one to watch. With his debut feature, `Hunger', he was able to pull an amazing performance out of the incredibly versatile Michael Fassbender, and he does the same here.

The aptly titled `Shame' centers around a man named Brandon Sullivan. Brandon seems to lead the perfect life. He has the perfect job, lives comfortably in an upscale apartment in New York, and is strikingly handsome and healthy for a man in his late thirties. All of his friends seem to love him, and he gets along quite well with his boss and co-workers. However, Brandon is living in darkness. The truth is that Brandon has been struggling with sexual addiction for quite some time, and as we will see throughout the course of the film, it has begun to devour him completely. Unable to form intimate bonds and meaningful relationships, Brandon has become a slave to his most carnal desires. His life consists of casual trysts with prostitutes and random men and women from clubs and bars, sexual encounters over the webcam, voyeurism, and compulsive masturbation - not to mention a drug habit.

When his emotionally damaged sister, Sissy, unexpectedly shows up at his apartment in need of a place to stay, she quickly becomes a nuisance in his life, placing a barrier between Brandon and his addiction. When she discovers his dark secret, she is appalled at first, but attempts to lead him to the path of recovery by reminding him that he is loved. These two damaged souls need one another to survive.

As the pressure mounts, Brandon's life begins to unravel. He goes to the very depths of hell and back. He begins to lose control, until one day when he is forced to deal with his demons head on.

There is hope for Brandon yet.

The performances in `Shame' are magnificent. Michael Fassbender delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the tortured Brandon. It is a tragedy that he was somehow overlooked for this years Oscar race. Carey Mulligan is equally powerful as Sissy. She was extraordinary in `An Education', and continues to impress with her monumental work here. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score is haunting as well. All technical and artistic aspects are perfect.

This is an exceptionally powerful film, and it is not recommended for those who are easily offended. Director Steve McQueen refused to censor this material to gain an R rating, and so the film was branded with a well-deserved NC-17 rating. The sexual content is extremely explicit, but serves a purpose within the context of the film, and is never gratuitous. If you are seeking titillation, you will not find it here. Onscreen sex has never looked so repulsive. Sex addiction is a serious issue that is rarely dealt with in the cinema. Steve McQueen tackles the subject with respect and constraint. The results are disturbing and rewarding. `Shame' is one of the best films of 2012.

Rated NC-17 for explicit sexual content, 101 minutes, directed by Steve McQueen, released by Fox Searchlight Pictures.",1329523200,13,3076,4.903846153846154
4960135,5,B006512BFU,"Shame is a brave, uninhibited film about a man crippled by his addiction to sex. This could have been the premise for a comedy, but British director Steve McQueen and his co-writer Abi Morgan have made it a startlingly powerful drama that tackles the subject head-on and with utter seriousness. This is McQueen's second film after his highly acclaimed, 2008 debut Hunger and he has once again cast Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Things have changed since 2008 and Fassbender's name carries more clout than it did previously. If Fassbender had made this film as an unknown actor, this would have garnered him some attention.

Sex addiction is a tricky subject to make a serious-minded film about. Most men cannot fathom how this type of addiction could be debilitating and may actually envy Fassbender's plight. Secondly, when you explore the depths of sex addiction in the frank, unflinching way this film does, you're risking mismanagement of the material. Showing a character's rendezvous with a trove of women is not too difficult, but showing these actions as driven by compulsion and anguish is. When you have to show a character so consumed with sex that he must constantly watch porn, masturbate, or go to whatever lengths necessary to achieve orgasm, you're running the risk of an audience giggling through the entire film. Furthermore, when your film has as much full-frontal nudity and simulated sex as this one, you run the risk of the audience finding it arousing which effectively destroys the impact of what's being shown.

Somehow, without the term ""sex addiction"" ever being mentioned out loud, this film manages to plunge the abyss of sex addiction with a strong sense of sincerity and show a character imprisoned by it. Nothing about the addiction portrayed is laughable and the many scenes of nudity and sex are far from erotic. People love to call porn ""art,"" but most people will admit (in secret) that most scenes of a sexual nature referred to as ""art"" and ""non-erotic"" are far from artistic and very erotic. None of these scenes in Shame are erotic and McQueen's profession as an artist is remarkably apparent in the way he has shot this film and put it together.

There was a difficult, but clear-eyed view of how this film was supposed to be and nothing ever comes across as insincere or overwrought. It's a very elegant-looking film with a couple of mainstream actors turning in powerhouse performances. The film has netted attention for its NC-17 rating and the refusal to appeal it. In a rare decision, the studio and filmmakers chose to embrace the rating rather than view it as a stigma. This was a smart decision, as nothing in Shame could have been toned down without sacrificing what makes it so effective in the first place.

Fassbender plays Brandon, a handsome, 30-something man living in New York City. He has a generic, suit-and-tie job and is well-off financially, but the specifics are unimportant. His private life is carefully cultivated to help guard his sexual compulsions which involve online porn, frequent masturbating, prostitutes, and picking up women for random physical encounters. Order in his life is important to him, as he's ashamed of the addiction that drives him. This carefully constructed lifestyle is crashed by the unexpected arrival of Sissy (Carey Mulligan), his little sister.

It's here that the movie could misstep by allowing this contrivance to push the film into Hollywood soap-opera territory. McQueen's command over the material instead provides open-ended implications into childhood trauma that may have lead to Brandon's uncontrollable lifestyle. There is the implication that both suffered something in their childhood that had a profound effect on the people they've become, but the film offers no easy answers. There is no heavy implication of any particular tragedy or abuse, no mention of mistreatment by a mother or father; the most revealing line of dialogue is Sissy telling Brandon ""we're not bad people, we just come from a bad place."" It's these concise flourishes of brilliance that fuel the development of these characters and their traits. The film allows us to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves, providing enough to elicit thought-provoking interpretations. The ambiguity doesn't make it unapproachable or inaccessible, just all the more fascinating and compelling.

Shame is composed of long, unbroken shots and mostly superfluous dialogue. Here is a film brave enough to hold a close-up of Carey Mulligan for roughly five minutes, with only one or two brief cutaways, as she sings `New York, New York.' This scene is remarkably powerful. Nothing in the rather minimal dialogue is particularly revealing about the psyche of the characters and McQueen brings us into Brandon's suffering using the artistic finesse that he brings to directing and through the acting prowess of Michael Fassbender.

The opening sequence illustrating Brandon's daily routine sets the mood appropriately, with a sweeping score by Harry Escott (that does appear to have been borrowed significantly from Hans Zimmer) that brilliantly complements what's onscreen. One of these early scenes shows Brandon's attention drifting to a woman on the subway, while sounds of sexual pleasure interrupt the soundtrack. They proceed to flirt with each other for a couple minutes without ever saying a word.

It's become a clich&eacute; to call an actor `brave' whenever they do something decidedly un-mainstream, like graphic nudity. It's appropriate for what Fassbender does here. He has several scenes of full-frontal nudity, but it's not just his flesh that's exposed. This is a brave, dedicated performance that shows him baring not only his skin, but his soul. A fearless actor, he builds a fully realized character and brings the audience into the anguish and suffering that Brandon feels without spoon-feeding his emotional state to the audience. He captures the isolation, the inability to form emotional connections. When Brandon reaches the peak of his desperation, Fassbender reminds us of what great acting truly is. There's not a note in his performance that seems false or forced, and the intense, personal emotion he portrays transcends mere acting. There are a lot of sex scenes and Fassbender convincingly emulates a man driven by necessity and compulsion rather than pleasure. These desires, these emotions, and that hollow emptiness he so perfectly captures could not have been easy to tap into. This is the best performance of 2011, by far.

Carey Mulligan is one of the most talented young actresses working today, but her previous roles reveal why McQueen was initially hesitant to cast her. Her role as Sissy is such a departure from her performances An Education, Never Let Me Go, and Drive, performances that are all, in one way or another, cut from the same cloth. Unlike Brandon, whose physical appearance betrays his internal trauma, Sissy wears her wounds inside and out. It's surprising to see this elegant, quiet actress play such a brash, trashy character with no respect for the boundaries that Brandon has to maintain his existence. The scenes they share pulse with tension, the lingering effects of a traumatizing past, and repressed emotion that give the film a jolt of raw realism.

At 99 minutes, Shame seems to run much longer. I did not find it tedious; in fact, I was so glued to my seat that I didn't move until the credits. It's just such an unflinching character stud that goes to some dark places to explore its main character. It gets under your skin, clutches your emotions, and leaves you feeling shell-shocked. Shame is a thought-provoking, poetic, and unforgettable film that tackles a rarely-discussed subject with great courage and vision. It's a movie you experience rather than passively view, alternatively graceful and gritty. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Beautifully directed, Shame contains two of the year's most powerful performances and is easily the most powerful film of the year. An adult drama that doesn't sacrifice artistic integrity in favor of commercial viability or accessibility, few films succeed at so effectively shaking up their audience. This is an uncompromising piece of filmmaking that travels into the depths of despair and depravity. When the credits roll, you'll feel like you've been assaulted.

4960136,5,B006512BFU,"""Shame"", Steve McQueen's stark and uncompromising exploration of the devastating effects of sex addiction, is a powerful glimpse into the dark parts of the human soul and how it can consume us. It stars Michael Fassbender as Brandon, viewed by his colleagues as a polite, well-kept business professional, who is secretly struggling with a sex addiction that causes him to seek out sexual release through either girls he meets at bars, escorts or masturbation, often in public bathrooms. In essence he lives in his own erotic world, though the sex is not for pleasure but simply to help block out some deep-seeded pain, which he tries to control with daily routines to keep focus. This world is disrupted when Sissy, his wayward sister with no other place to go, arrives and requests a place to stay. Brandon reluctantly agrees which appeared to be one of a few attempts to change his habits; the other being starting a real relationship with a beautiful young coworker. Things seem to be going well, but Sissy's intrusive and erratic behavior, though often not intentional, quickly disrupts the rituals that held his psyche together and he begins to break. Her presence makes him feel constricted and bring back those feelings and memories he seemed dead set to repress with his sexual behavior, causing him to spiral downward with his sexual exploits becoming more extreme as the resurgence of his past and inability to cope with her needs boil to the surface.

It is important to understand, because the story relies so heavily on their interactions, that Sissy and Brandon share similar pains, though they go about suppressing them in different ways. Sissy is outgoing and wants everyone to love her; whereas Brandon is reserved and prefers to be on his own. When ""living"" becomes too hard they give in to harmful behavior. For Brandon it is sexual stimulation and for Sissy it is cutting herself, as pointed out by Brandon's coworker after noticing her scarred wrist. It is this conflict in their personalities that creates the most drama. They are not suited for one another, Sissy's intruding in Brandon's sheltered existence and Brandon's refusing to give her the attention and love she needs are the sparks that lead to destruction. It is not long before their clashing reaches an unbearable limit and they are both so terribly damaged, and heartbreakingly so, that when they both hit bottom it is a tragic moment. Especially for Brandon who finds himself under the pain of both the shame he places upon himself and his sister.

McQueen plays coy on what exactly about their past has had this effect on them but clearly there is a lot under the surface that has left them scarred. Many have complained about this lack of back story or an outright explanation to Brandon's behavior but McQueen is less interested in a thoroughly develop story, and more concerned with peeking into the lives of these individuals. This is honestly all we need. It is sometimes too hard for people to accept that this is just the way we are. Humans have their demons. Films have already thoroughly gone through the scenarios that could lead to this behavior. All that matters is the now, how technology and New York help him to indulge in his addiction, and how he copes with the present.

As Brandon Michael Fassbender gives one of the most haunting and courageous performances in a very long time. His willingness to bear all, in scenes the audience can barely sit through let along imagine being a part of, along with his ability to open himself up physically and emotionally and relay so much pain, in a way that feels so human, was just outstanding.

Carey Mulligan also shines here in a roll that is unlike anything she has ever done. She plays Sissy as a woman who clearly has her own demons, and although she might seem more outgoing and capable or connecting with others, she also has a hard time coping with the past and the rejection of lovers and her brother. One of the film's most stunning moments comes when Mulligan, in a close up, sings `New York New York' in a powerful, raw and emotional rendition that really mirrored her whole performance.

The result of it all is a dark and unsettling portrait of self-destructive souls, driven by some unknown torment, so lost and damaged, struggling to mask one great shame with another in an attempt to feel something; not pleasure but rather the physical and moral pains of the acts they commit. Alone this is challenging stuff, but with the addition of exquisite long shots, beautiful photography adding a sort of poetic grace all set to a hypnotic score by Harry Escott, it becomes not only an emotional but also visually mesmerizing experience.",1328918400,4,4695,4.820099255583126
4960137,5,B006512BFU,"Shame is an unrelenting film about addiction.
If you are faint of heart, don't see this movie.

Fassbender stars as Brandon, a thirty-something sales associate who's addiction for sex overshadows his life.
Brandon seeks sex in ANYWAY he can. His life begins to slowly unravel when younger sister, Sissy, played by Mulligan, shows up for an impromptu visit.

Director, McQueen, never explains the hidden dynamic between the two, that is left up to the audience to figure out. One scene, upon first knowing that he has a visitor, sets the mood for the rest of the film.
Brandon tries to desperately have a ""normal"" relationship with Marianne, a co-worker but he cannot bear intimacy.

Shame is a difficult, defiant, non-erotic drama intended to make you squirm. McQueen sets the tone and close-ups beautifully as the two talk and tear each other up. Using the streets of New York as a backdrop, the mood feels gritty, dirty and in need of a hot shower.

4960138,5,B006512BFU,"I was mesmerised watching this film.  Michael Fassbender, who was robbed of the best actor oscar nomination, is pure perfection.  Shame is a harrowing, disturbing and unsettling look at what happens when one becomes a slave to his or her addiction.  Michael Fassbender delivers a tour de force performance as a damaged, upwardly mobile sex addict living in Manhattan.  Carey Mulligan, who was also robbed of an oscar nomination, plays Brandon's equally damaged sister and is fantastic as well.  I was horrified, saddened and fascinated watching this incredible work of art.

There are many unanswered questions as to what happened between Brandon and his sister when they were younger.  They have a  very disturbing relationship that raises a great deal of questions. Then there are Brandons' sexcapades and  inability to connect on an emotional level.  There is something slightly Patrick Batemanish about Brandon for those of you who have read and seen American Psycho.  The ice cold personality, the impeccable clothes and apartment. Brandon, of course is not a psychotic killer.

 Some have referred to Brandon as a deviant or monster.  I think not.  This is someone who needs help for emotional problems.  My heart broke when his attempt at having a normal relationship fails in the worst possible way. If you think this film is sex, sex, sex think again. This film is not erotic nor is it sexy. Shame is not an easy film to watch. I remember sitting in the theater and not being able to look at the screen.  The sex is graphic and so is the nudity.  However both are not gratuitous and are tastefully shot.  I studied human behavior for four years in college but the jury was always out on sex addiction.  This film has convinced me.

4960139,4,B006512BFU,"This is an artsy adult film about a socially inept man addicted to porn, particularly Internet porn. His NY apartment is furnished a bit Spartan. His boring life is interrupted when his sister, Carey Mulligan comes to stay. There is an awkward scene where he stares at her naked body while she showers. It is designed to show how dysfunctional and creepy Brandon has become in life, like the long drawn out subway scene. His sister is in a bad relationship and is as dysfunctional as Brandon. She is a nightclub singer. The suicidal Carey is desperate for intimacy as is hinted in so many scenes.

Brandon's dysfunction is apparently from living a semi-isolated life on a computer. His obsession with casual sex, porn, and masturbation causes problems in his life which escalates as the film progresses. Brandon realizes he has issues and takes steps to resolve those issues, but has trouble moving forward toward a normal sexual relationship that involves intimacy and only compounds things.

Fassbender and McQueen do an excellent job in capturing the character of Brandon as we see his despair, grief, and isolation. This is the type of film in which I had to watch the whole thing to decide if I liked it or not depending on the ending. After seeing the ending, I am still not sure, which is why I have opted to sit on the fence post at 3 stars. Oh wait! I will add a star for nudity...but I'm not a pervert.

It made me miss New York and be happy I am no living there......all in the same movie. I know of someone who has some of Brandon's, the lead character, qualities. It perfectly captures the thrill of being successful in New York. And sometimes the emptiness and vacancy you may feel once you establish that success if you don't have a strong support system that you can be honest with. His apartment is very much the starkness of a bachelor in New York. When confronted with the possibility of a real connection with a co-worker, possibly subordinate, his  self assured persona withers. He is unable to make that leap from anonymity to intimacy.

Carey Mulligan's role is a little more tragic, but, painfully real. Once again, she reminds Brandon about the danger of isolation despite his protest of wanting to navigate through life, solo.

It is definitely a movie I will be purchasing on Blu-Ray.

4960141,1,B006512BFU,"This is a movie supposedly about ""sex addiction"". But it really has nothing to say on that subject. Its more like Voyeurism of a so-called sex addict. The only points made end up being the obvious one that the main character has issues being close to women emotionally. But they mess even that point up by making the main character into the seduction master. He stares at women with his magic eyes and suddenly they decide on a quickie. It would have been more real for him to go after the desperate or the kind of women who are at a bar for last call. Its just silly to say that he can emotionally seduce almost magically while the basis for the character is emotional detachment.

What I liked least in the film is when it drags out one of the oldest cliche in the world and blames all of Brandon's problems on child abuse. They don't linger on it, but they make sure the point is clear.

The film is good at making sex boring and of communicating the problem of the sex addict in that sense. But it doesn't really make for a compelling film. The boring and empty activities of the film end up being boring for the audience as well.

The film adds in a redemption element through a sister. But its all really crude and obvious stuff. And the point reached at the end where he can only solve his own problems by attaching himself to the troubles of another person isn't very deep.

The director has given himself the primary writing credit for the film. But as with his previous film (Hunger), the secondary writing credit is given to an experienced writer (in this case Abi Morgan). After having done this twice, it really raises questions about how much of a writer/director he actually is. And why exactly he is giving himself the primary writing credit (not plotting credit or secondary credit for example) in his films.

Steve McQueen (the director) is of course more famous now for parties and being famous than he is for his work. He is a ruthless self-promotor of the Andy Warhol variety. He has shown some degree of talent, but after this film I wonder if the talent is more in the people he can gather around himself than his actual skill. This wasn't a great film and minus the talented actors who signed on the project, it would have been a terrible film. It may be that his real talent is more being a producer than a director.",1327536000,21,2341,4.422273781902552
