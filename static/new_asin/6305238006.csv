7885783,4,6305238006,"This video contains instructions for three Latin dances--rumba, cha cha, and salsa.  Greg Gale provides the detailed steps systematically and from various angles. He teaches the footwork (and arm movements) methodically that enables the viewer (with use of the rewind/review buttons) to follow and learn the dance steps (he spends little time on how to dance with flair and artistry). With each dance, Gale teaches four to six basic steps clearly.  Each dance lesson is concluded with a practice session where Greg Gale and Nancy Hays puts together in various combinations the lessons learned (and where Gale is more relaxed and conveys the enjoyment of the dance). Practicing repeatedly what is learned from this instruction-tape, one will be able to enjoy oneself on the dance floor. [NOTE: Your local public library may have a copy of this dance instruction tape.]",1152489600,3,867,5.185714285714286
