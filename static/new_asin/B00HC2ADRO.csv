6153864,5,B00HC2ADRO,"I have been a Registered Nurse for 30 years and this is the first nurse perspective health care show I have seen that is accurate.  I am astonished by the subtle interplay between the nursing and medical professionals that clearly demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses common in these professions.  Dialogue is spot on, situations are completely believable.  Thank you writers and actors for making this show possible and I hope for many more years of production.

I wrote the above after viewing 4/6 shows first season.  They went off track  in episode 5 as the drunkenness, patient care and LVN charge nurse situation were not handled realistically but the writers pulled the show back together in episode 6.",1397692800,7,713,5.0
6153865,5,B00HC2ADRO,What an incredible staff and group of writers and actors.  This was absolutely the funniest series I have seen in ages.  You will literally laugh out loud many times per episode and yet find many poignant moments that stick with you long after seeing the show.  Well done.,1397088000,4,272,4.625
6153866,5,B00HC2ADRO,"A remake of the British series.  Good to see that Jo Brand is on board for the US version as well.  I had my doubts 'cause I like the UK version so much.  So well written, so well played, so dark, yet so funny.  And the US version is no different, just as rude and crude.  Almost an exact copy of the British storyline (just about) and again, with a brilliant cast.  Glad they didn't mess this one up. On top there is some social comment on healthcare in the US.",1391212800,9,462,4.021978021978022
6153867,5,B00HC2ADRO,"This is a gem of a series with sublime writing that takes place in an extended care facility. Darkly funny, it ran for six episodes on HBO with hopefully more to come. It is based on a British series which I haven't seen yet, but which can't be much better than this brilliant look at the care of the elderly. Told from the perspective of the nurses and doctors in the unit,  the emphasis is on the nursing staff for once. NeCe Nash is almost unrecognizable without glamorous hair and make up, and delivers her funniest lines in a dead pan manner. She seems to be the one voice of reason amongst chaos. Alex Borstein plays Dawn, a needy, put-upon nurse who falls for and pursues the sexually ambigious head nurse Patsy. Patsy hopes to turn the ward into a pro-active, by the book example of modern medicine from a perspective of sunshine and happiness. He is constantly thwarted by medical director Jenna James played so well by a hilarious Dawn Metcalf. She is ousted from the main hospital and is forced into heading the unit, which is far below the standards of prestige she aspires to. This story's strength is it's focus on these main character'so with their elderly patients providing the comedic backdrop. Their actions and attitudes are no less funny for being realistic. We all know someone like one of these people.",1390521600,12,1325,4.638297872340425
6153868,3,B00HC2ADRO,"It was a bit plodding, not overly funny. The characters aren't particularly captivating. I'll probably try season 2 though because the show kept running for some reason, so maybe it improved.",1472688000,,191,5.193548387096774

I can't say enough good about placing orders thru Amazon",1456099200,,131,4.739130434782608
6153871,3,B00HC2ADRO,Filthy crass - no warning that this was so in-classy. Just really did not expect that. I order many series on Amazon. This one is almost as bad as the later seasons of Nip & Tuck,1454544000,,178,3.9722222222222223
6153872,5,B00HC2ADRO,"This show could be a documentary it is so true!  I am an RN and 63 years old.  My 84-year-old mother recently passed away from advanced dementia.  It may not appeal to people who have not been there buts this was the panacea for me.  I laughed and cried at times.  It is accurate depiction of women in our society and how we end up.  No matter our differences and sometimes pettiness, we are sisters under the skin and have amazing strength and resiliency.  It is real people with all their faults and virtues and heroes revealed in the least likely of situations.",1452211200,,564,4.41747572815534
6153873,5,B00HC2ADRO,"Darkly funny; excellent acting.  Niecy Nash shines throughout.
Season 1 - good; stories were funny and touching without being cloying
Season 2 - excellent; thoroughly engaging and moving; best 30 minutes on television
Season 3 - good; much less subtle than the first two seasons; the characters' flaws are more pronounced; the show moves from pathos to farce by the end of the season",1450483200,,383,4.984375

6153877,5,B00HC2ADRO,Had an accurate view of some of the crazy things that go on in the health industry. All the rules and regulations that clog up the system.  The joys and frustrations of caring for the whole of all types of people with all types of problems. The regulations that are made pose a harder problem than the issues it attemps to fix.  Great laughs and  sad moments that are also a part of the industry.,1442275200,,396,4.253333333333333

6153881,5,B00HC2ADRO,"An extraordinarily funny, wise, poignant series that is simply so far outside the usual fare of entertainment that it can't be pigeon-holed.  Laugh out loud hilarious in a context that is (for those who've nursed elderly parents in their last days) somehow also touching and true.  My only gripe is that there are ONLY 6 episodes per season. You will love it or hate it.  The characters are unsinkable, recognizable, complex, and engaging.  The writing is low-key and smart.  Only 6 episodes a season is just nuts.",1435449600,,514,4.862068965517241

6153886,5,B00HC2ADRO,I gave as a gift for a neice in the geriatrics field as I am a fan of the show. She loved it! There is a lot to laugh and learn and appreciate for all in health care and those taking care of them.,1421193600,,196,3.477272727272727

6153889,4,B00HC2ADRO,hilarious although my husband tells me it's extremely funny to me because I am a nurse.  It's so brilliant and spot-on that you will die laughing and cringing if you have ever worked in healthcare.,1419984000,3,197,4.628571428571429

6153894,5,B00HC2ADRO,"Harsh facts, harsh ideas and harsh lighting! Listened to an interview on NPR by the series' creators & decided to take a chance. Watched the characters develop on screen & enjoyed the biting scripts. Reality is not always pretty but the lighting was fascinating! The selective use (or lack) of  makeup to emphasize the harsh reality of life. If you have a grasp of reality & enjoy dark humor, this was made for you!",1417219200,4,415,4.608108108108108

6153896,5,B00HC2ADRO,"This show is brilliant!

I am beyonddddddd excited for the new season....
I initially tuned in because of Laurie Metcalf... Niecy Nash  stole my heart! Her performance is award worthy IMO...excellence in every way...the whole cast is at the top of their game
Bravo HBO for superb broadcasting...this show is the reason for my subscription
Hope to see them all at the Emmy's next year",1410048000,2,383,4.876923076923077

8631522,5,B00HC2ADRO,"I don't normally write reviews, but I think its a complete tragedy that this show didn't run for at least a few more seasons. I could have watched it forever. Laurie Metcalf is EVERYTHING, but I loved all of the actors. You have to really pay attention or you're going to miss some of the funniest parts, such as the faces the patients make or the antics they pull in the background (Varla!!!). Laurie Metcalf especially... the little details she puts into her character.... down to certain looks she gives. Its really excellent acting. No matter what line of work you're in, youve probably dealt with at LEAST one of these characters before. Im not a toilet humor person, so yea, I could have done without so much anal/fecal talk. But if you like dark humor, youll love this. Its equal parts hilarious, emotional and horrifying. I also love the realness of everyone. I love this show and will be repeat binge watching it. My only complaint is that there should have been a lot more episodes... and at least a few more seasons.",1511395200,,1027,4.586956521739131

8631525,5,B00HC2ADRO,"I work in an extended-care facility and the thing that makes this show hysterically funny is this is EXACTLY how it is---take the most ridiculously absurd scene in this series and I've seen it or heard about it. Nurses had to have written and/or produced it. The acting is beyond the best comedic acting I've ever seen---I've known a hundred Dawns(Alex Borstein is PERFECT), Dr. James and DiDis. The patients and the family members are completely spot-on (now that I've been ""a family member"",I have a lot better insight into the idiosynchrasies we have).The Head Nurse and HR rep---exact,no exaggeration. Absolutely true and absurd. Best show HBO has ever done.",1499990400,,662,5.027272727272727
