6434146,2,B00KMUL926,For the most part just another really bad movie & waste of time. It wasn't even a found footage film like i thought it would be.,1435622400,,128,3.9615384615384617
6434147,2,B00KMUL926,"Pretty bad.  Was hoping for more but with out the main actress being who she is, I wouldn't have gotten as I saw many other bad reviews.  Maybe rent it for $4 if you are curious, but overall just a bad story and mostly bad acting as well.",1426032000,2,238,3.9375
6434148,1,B00KMUL926,"Just another boring, cliched, micro budget, c-movie ""horror"" title to throw on the ""pass"" pile. No scares at all, and you will just find yourself with yet another dull excursion into the home movie/found footage genre set in yet another cliched location (mental hospital, prison, castle, abandoned church... take your pick)...",1416528000,,326,5.411764705882353
6434149,2,B00KMUL926,"While doing some horror movie roaming at FYE on the eve of Halloween, I was looking for a good horror movie to take home and watch; mostly one I had never seen before. After looking around for awhile I came upon Asylum of the Dead. The cover initially grabbed my attention for some reason and after reading the synopsis on the back, I decided to buy it. Of course, not feeling 100% sold on it, I decided to look at some reviews on here before opening it and fortunately I was able to come across this movie on Youtube for free.

The plot centers on a group of young people who look to be in their 20s, that are in route to the Pennhurst Psychiatric Hospital to film a TV show to capture what they find. See, the Pennhurst hospital was permanently shut down in 1986 after a horrific massacre took place there and has been deemed to be haunted with the supernatural spirits of the patients ever since. While on the way, one of the crew members tells a story of how another TV crew had ventured out to the hospital about a year before and was never seen again. So why on earth would they go out there then????

Once they arrive at their destination, they meet the caretaker of this hospital who warns them of the spirits that lurk on the grounds of the sanitarium and gives them the option of turning back or going through with their adventure. So this place has been closed down since the 1980s, is completely abandoned and decrepit and there's a caretaker who's there, despite knowing about these spirits?? And the TV crew is okay with that?? Once inside, the crew split up to explore the different parts of the hospital. Along the way, as they encounter several awakened spirits of the sanitarium who torment them, they become fearful for their lives as members of the group are killed off one at a time in some of the most gruesome ways possible. While they believe the ghosts to be responsible, they have no clue that an entity far more terrifying and demented lurks within the hospital and is responsible.

Overall: Everything that you think could be wrong with this film, is. In a way, this movie is no different than the 70 other teen like slasher films that've been made over the last 2 decades. The acting in this is very mediocre and the effects aren't all that great either. They use this special effect to cut away to the next scene that at first confused me for thinking it was a flashback scene. Too much goes on this movie that doesn't make sense that was mentioned in the review; such as this TV crew still choosing to go to his sanitarium, despite hearing of a similar crew that went out there and never came back. On top of that, the writers put together some of the most unoriginal and cheesiest segments in this movie. For example, one of the characters name in this movie is called Dr. Death. Really? What is this the 90s?? Then there's a scene where one of the crew members has sex with the spirit of a rather beautiful patient to which the other crew members refer to as ""ghost sex"" saying ""ghost sex is some serious sh*t"".

The only thing this movie gets props for are the death scenes. One or two in particular are pretty gruesome and one will even leave male viewers uncomfortable. The ending doesn't make a whole lot of sense either but what you expect? Overall, Asylum of the Dead is just a horrible low budget movie. There's no logic in this movie at all, the story-telling is off, the ending is dumb, and the acting is low-key. The most notable person to appear in this movie is Michael Rooker a.k.a. Merle Dixon from the Walking Dead. Aside from him, Haylie Duff and porn star Ryan Keely also appear in this film. Despite it all, Asylum of the Dead is a horror film for the horrific effort that was put into this movie overall. I'm so glad I saw this movie on Youtube before opening it. Now it's going right back to FYE so it can sit on the shelf where it belongs",1415318400,,3892,4.386426592797784
6434150,2,B00KMUL926,"I'm being generous with the two stars only because a Walking Dead actor is in the film. Other than that, totally garbage acting, sex-crazed ghost hunters, foul language and total teenage idiocy make this movie nearly unbearable to watch. Should be rated R and almost X for the near por.n.o. scene. LEAVE this video in the asylum, and not in your home!",1412985600,,351,4.67741935483871

6434153,2,B00KMUL926,"I am a local and grew up just a mile from this place. It is really haunted but the things i have experienced there are more suspenseful and scarier then this movie. It was complete garbage acting . Over all I watched this movie for my own personal enjoyment due to I got to see a part of my childhood. For entertainment STAY AWAY! Go spend money on a movie that has good acting. good plot, and more excitement.",1410825600,3,410,4.2025316455696204
8660151,1,B00KMUL926,"Absolutely terrible, yet for some reason I kept watching.  I think I wouldn't have been able to sleep at night unless every moron I encountered met a gruesome end.  And the deaths? Not particularly satisfying.  Gore hounds won't find much to like here either.  You get a lot of shots of Duff's boobs (I guess it was perpetually cold on set?) and some awkward sex, and LaRou's character, Willard, looks like he's ashamed to be there in every single scene.  Whenever something 'creepy' happens, loud ""music"" drowns out any chance of a scare.  Even if you factor in attempts at humor or parody here, and I'm not sure they intended any of it, it's just wasted time I'm never getting back.",1529539200,,684,4.6115702479338845
8660152,1,B00KMUL926,"Why isn't there a no star button.  Or a button that says BIG NOPE.  Because this movie was hell.  I mean, it may have gotten better, but after 18 minutes I had reached my limit.  I thought a movie with Haylie Duff and Beverly Mitchell would be kind of interesting.  Nope.  BIG NOPE.  Again, I'm only going on 18 minutes, but I can't imagine this movie suddenly changing direction and getting better.",1525737600,,399,4.458333333333333
8660153,1,B00KMUL926,"This movie is astonishingly horrible. I kept asking myself why Haylie Duff and Beverly Mitchell would be part of such an embarrassing film project. SPOILER ALERT: Most importantly, this movie is filled with misandry (a hatred of men) as its male characters are killed and mutilated in disgusting ways while the female characters remain unharmed or die peacefully. It's common nowadays for horror movies to lean towards misandry but this movie goes way overboard.",1524787200,,462,5.256756756756757
8660154,3,B00KMUL926,A movie with a weak plot. Beverley Mitchel is the main reason that I bought this movie I actually hoped that it would be way better,1479600000,,131,4.076923076923077
8660155,3,B00KMUL926,"""The Lost Episode"" and ""Asylum of the Dead"" are the same film....and ""Pennhurst"" too.

A group of kids enter the haunted Asylum of Pennhurst being turned into a horror theme park. One teen tells a story about a film group that disappeared here while filming a ghost hunters episode. He tells the story that involves ghosts and an evil doctor. Much of the film is a flashback. The terror wasn't there. although they tried with jump scares that you see coming. I did like the ending, but not much more except for maybe that one scene.
