472394,5,6302484499,"Under Sidney Lumet's superb direction, Sir Ralph Richardson, Katherine Hepburn, Dean Stockwell and Jaosn Robards, Jr. convey the beauty and pain of a masterpiece of American drama. The tension builds slowly to a  devestating and emotionally wrenching conclusion, as each member of the  Tyrone family confronts the knowledge that the ties of love cannot save  them from the unfulfilled dreams and illusions of a past that continues to  haunt them in the present. With the somber black-and-white cinematography  and the stark intensity of Andre Previn's solo piano score setting the  mood, the actors give some of their finest performances, capturing all the  power of O'Neill's masterpiece.",927849600,2,689,5.443396226415095

472433,4,6302484499,"All things considered, a very good production that kept me engrossed throughout. (I watched it over the course of three nights)  That said,  Hepburn's performance is a tad too actorish for my taste. I was almost always conscious of her doing her utmost to portray misery, as opposed to the feelings coming across  more naturally and effortlessly. In fact, come to think of it, Robards (Jamie) and Richardson (James Tyrone) struck  me as highly accomplished actors who somehow fell just a bit short of real pathos. Surprisingly, I found Dean Stockwell's Edmond  to be  the most natural-seeming character. (Let us pass over in silence the exaggerated, screechy Irish maid!)
But don''t get me wrong; this is a moving and well-paced movie version, despite touches of ham!",1465516800,,767,5.0476190476190474

472435,5,6302484499,"One of the great plays of the 20th century, with a superb cast: Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards, Jr. and Dean Stockwell, each one at their best. The unsparing story of playwright Eugene O'Neill's wildly dysfunctional family, barely disguised, which is why he didn't want it performed until after his death.

472436,5,6302484499,"I have seen 6 stage productions of O'Neill's greatest play and this film, brilliantly directed by Sidney Lumet, may very well be the best version in any medium. This 1962 film is timeless and the power of O'Neill's epic family drama has never been more searing. The cast is perfection. Ralph Richardson, a brilliant , often idiosyncratic actor, is superb as James Tryone , the veteran matinee stage idol who made a devil's bargain by latching on to a proven box office success at the expense of expanding his artistic career to more glorious heights. Jason Robards Jr. gives a powerful performance as eldest son Jamie, a struggling actor with a serious alcohol addiction. Dean Stockwell plays the younger brother Edmund (the stand-in for the young Eugene O'Neill) and he brings a sensitivity and gravitas to the part that is impressive. But it is Katherine Hepburn, as the matriarch of the family, who you will never forget. Mary Tyrone's lonely existence and morphine drug dependency, her variable mood swings (from hazy post-drugged calm to frenzied, guilt-induced accusations) is brought to galvanizing life in a performance that has to be seen to be believed. This is one of the greatest film performances of the twentieth century.

And this is one of director Sidney Lumet's greatest films, perhaps his finest achievement in a legendary career. The Olive Films Blu-ray presentation offers a sterling black and white image, preserving this magnificent motion picture for future generations.",1457913600,6,1494,5.148148148148148

472571,5,6302484499,This production preserves an excellent production of an American classic.  The entire cast headed by Katheryn Hepburn and Ralph Richardson gives moving performances.

472574,3,6302484499,"This is a long black and white film which probably is more expressionistically shot than O'neill would have liked. Everything seems a little too exagerated and angular for the text of the play. The cinamatographer or the director (Sydney Lummet) were apparently bigger fans of Strindberg than of O'Neill. I think the father is totally miss-cast he does not come across as a has been Irish actor at all which really flaws the film. On the other hand Katherine Hepburn, as the mother, totally saves the film in the last scene. She throws away all the exagerated poses and shyly, quietly breaks your heart. As written in the play the other actors just sit there mute - lost beyond words after Katherine's last speech and so does the audience.

The sparce piano score by Andre Previn fits the cinamagraphic vision -dark, Quixotic and atonal. I would love to listen to it seperate from the movie but it too is more apropos of a Strindberg or Ibsen piece.",1393804800,,949,4.682634730538922

472638,5,6302484499,"If you're dealing with drama by Eugene O'Neill and acting by Katharine Hepburn and Ralph Richardson, you can't go wrong.

472639,5,6302484499,"Katherine Hepburn handles the main character role perfectly. From having been a WWII pinup girl to recreating the Pulitzer Prize-winning Eugene O'Neil's middle-aged woman at a bitter and desperate point of life, compounded by other family members also in decline, she handles the mood swings of a Morphine addicted woman who has gotten lost in life. This was an intriguing balance of transposing an essential stage play into a screenplay. The producer and director created this movie in 1962. But if it had been made in today's Hollywood, I suspect it would have been more liberated with flashbacks developing subplots better. Color alone would improve the film as well as totally disengaging from Method acting. How would today's powerhouse actresses handle the role of Mary Tyrone? With another Oscar performance as was Hepburn's?",1361577600,,832,5.2631578947368425

Even Jeanne Barr in a comic role is very very good.
Other video presentations were spotty but we collectors kept because it was the only version to be had but now that Olive Films has given it is just production I urge everyone interested to upgrade their collection.  There have been many wonderful actresses who have played Mary Tyrone but only The Great Kate and Constance Cummings are available on dvd..Cummings is equally great.",1351987200,13,714,4.974789915966387
472642,3,6302484499,"Eugene O'Neill's play is dark and depressing. But this is a very good rendition of it, with Katherine Hepburn as Mary Tyrone, Ralph Richardson as James Tyrone, Senior, Jason Robards, Jr., as James Tyrone, Junior (how's that for typecasting?), and Dean Stockwell as Edmund Tyrone.

They're living in their summer home on a lake, which has never been finished off or decorated like a proper Victorian home, but has rough wood in the interior which has never been painted or papered. James, Senior, is a retired actor who invests in lousy land deals, gets ripped off, and is a primary tightwad as a result. He keeps talking about ending his life in the poor house.

Mary is his vain, nervous, neurotic, and possibly psychotic wife, who is addicted to morphine. Elder son Jamie is a failure and a drunk. Younger son Edmund is diagnosed with consumption. Since Mary's father died of consumption when she was much too young to cope with it, she's in denial, and in mind-bending fear of losing her favorite son.

This is a completely dysfunctional family with enough money to hide their dysfunction from the rest of the world. And enough acting ability to attempt to hide it from one another. Mary does the passive-aggressive thing where she says something terribly accusatory and then adds, ""But I'm not blaming you, dear . . ."" They all say the most biting things to one another and then apologize for them and declare how much they love each other. And apparently they do, ""in spite of it all,"" as both Mary and James put it on different occasions.

As they deal with the crisis of Edmund's diagnosis, Mary's return to morphine, and the Jameses, father and son, and their sense of failure and alcoholic loss of self-control, the audience learns a lot about their history and why they are so screwed up. It's heart-breaking, but it's also hard to like them.

Still, it's the script that is depressing, not the quality of the acting, the settings or the costumes. So I give it as many stars as I can.",1336867200,,1994,4.669515669515669

472644,3,6302484499,"I really can't believe that Criterion has released The Fugitive Kind recently, which is 5th-rate Tennessee Williams, in a spectacular transfer, and meanwhile nobody has bothered to restore or re-issue this great 1962 film, possibly one of the best play-into-film adaptations of all time. Really? Film companies are lavishing money and resources on releasing crap like Love Story and Where Love has Gone on Blu-ray, but nothing for this masterpiece?

Anyway, the 2004 Lionsgate/Republic DVD is garbage. It's dual-layered, but the print used is cropped, interlaced, full of artifacts, has no shadow detail and has horrible contrast. It's atrocious and should have been taken out of print long ago.",1324857600,7,695,5.376146788990826
472645,5,6302484499,"Extraordinary adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's semi-autobiographical play.  O'Neill's best play transfers to the screen with its power intact.  Director Sidney Lumet uses the text of the play itself as his script, with very little embellishment or alteration.  The film maintains the claustrophobic nature of the original, with most of the action taking place in the drawing room of a summer house on Long Island.

The story deals with one day in the life of a singularly dysfunctional family:  James Tyrone (Ralph Richardson) is a miserly, washed-up actor living in the glory days of his past; his wife Mary (Katherine Hepburn) is a middle-aged woman addicted to morphine; their older son, Jamie (Jason Robards, Jr.) is an alcoholic; and the younger son, Edmund (Dean Stockwell) is a guilt-ridden young man suffering from tuberculosis.

The entire cast is superb, but the standout is Hepburn.  Giving one of the best performances in her long and distinguished career, Hepburn is in turn maddening, pathetic and, finally, tragic.  The conclusion of the film, where she rejoins her family, lost in a morphine-induced haze, is positively devastating.

Very long, very dark, this film is not to everyone's taste.  But for those who love classic American drama, and especially fans of Hepburn, they don't get any better than this!",1318809600,2,1324,5.202830188679245

I want only to add to these that this film contains the greatest acting performance in the history of films. Katharine Hepburn moves between intentions, emotions, layers, and states of mind at the speed of thought, with the greatest authenticity, range, and ease that has ever been captured on film. It is a masterpiece within a masterpiece, and shows one virtuoso creating an opportunity for another virtuoso to reach their ultimate expression. It is an unparalleled performance, it has no peers. The entire film is wonderful, with Oneill, Lumet, Richardson, Robards, and lovely Stockwell providing the framework for the best performance ever given by an on screen performer.

Her unconcerned, miser husband, who denies medical help for his younger son, rather heavy on the drink, is brilliantly acted by Sir Ralph Richardson.

472736,5,6302484499,"Maybe it's time I start reevaluating my opinion of Katherine Hepburn.  I have long stood by the opinion that she was merely good at what she does and nothing particularly special.  I've always boasted a preference for the 'other' Hepburn, Audrey, and have laid claim to the feeling that Katherine was one of the most overrated actresses in cinematic history.  Lately though, I've been watching a lot of her films either for the first time or again and I've found that the bulk of her work is very impressive.  Whether she's carrying a meandering film (`The African Queen'), stealing the limelight away from preferable talent (`Suddenly, Last Summer', where she steals my attention from Elizabeth Taylor, an actress I am much more fond of) or simply being brilliant in a brilliant film (`The Lion in Winter'), she is actually more than just `good' at what she does; she's very, very good.

Yes, I still hold to the fact she has won far too many Oscars, and for sub par work at that (`On Golden Pond' and especially `Look Who's Coming to Dinner' are very mediocre performances at best), but I can no longer say that I don't care for her as an actress.

Her talent is too big to ignore.

So, that brings me to `Long Day's Journey into Night', Sidney Lumet's 1962 theatrical adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play.  Based on O'Neill's home life, the story tells of a close knit family slowly falling apart due to addictions and sickness.  Mary Tyrone and husband James are in a tattered marriage.  James is a failed film star who struggles with alcoholism, which he seems to have handed down to his eldest son Jamie.  Mary, in order to cope with her youngest son's possible illness, has resorted to prescription medicines that `ease the pain'.  In fact, the youngest son Edmund seems to be the only rational one in the bunch.  The film takes place over one evening, while Edmund is awaiting test results.  Through the course of the evening the family seems to hash out some of their darkest fears and issues.  They confront the reasons behind Mary's addiction, as well as Jamie's harbored resentment for his younger brother.

Yes, this is a stage play adaptation, and beings that it is a faithful one it does not contain much more than lengthy conversations; and with a running time of close to three hours it is not a film for the short of attention.

The performances are truly what make this film so unforgettable.  Katherine Hepburn is stunning as the matriarch so close to her wits end.  Ralph Richardson is also brilliant as her husband James, attributing his character a balanced sense of frustration and contribution.  The real highlights, for me at least, come from Dean Stockwell and Jason Robards, who embody the sons with such fiery determination.  As Jamie, Robards is brutally abrasive, devouring his every internal demon.  A stark contrast is Stockwell, who gives Edmund the appearance of an observer, allowing him to take in his surroundings before deliberating.  All four of them are stunning, but in my opinion this film belongs to Stockwell (although Hepburn is a revelation, don't get me wrong).

If you are a fan of the stage, the cast or the subject (I've always been drawn to the internal struggle of family life) then this is a film you must see.  I can't really think of a single flaw.  Like I mentioned, there is not much action, so if you are not used to this brand of film layout then you might not be pleased entirely.  There is a lot of talking; basically one conversation after the other, but the film is never boring for each actor emotes so well in such a small space.  I'd highly recommend this one; highly.",1241049600,4,3634,4.6892744479495265

472738,5,6302484499,"I never cared much for Katherine Hepburn's acting until she reached middle age and began her triumphal progress to a very robust old age. Her acting just got better--in part because she was given more substantial material & roles to play. I saw her on stage once. The play wasn't anything to speak of--and Hepburn had broken her leg & was confined to a wheel chair. But from the moment she rolled herself on stage the actress RADIATED. I was sitting in probably cheapest seat in the very last row of the house--and I didn't feel I was missing anything. KH filled the entire theatre with her stage presence. I know how corny this sounds, but KH had a magnetic aura.

In terms of this particular film, Hepburn is certainly at her most commanding. The signs of Huntington's disease she suffered from (resulting in tremors, particularly of the head) are barely discernable. They actually fit the role in that the symptoms could pass off as part of the addictive process of the character she was portraying. I also think that LONG DAYS JOURNEY was playwright Eugene O'Neil's best work--probably because it hit so close to home. It is basically a 4-character play (5 if you include the Irish maid who represents an outsider momentarily peeking in at the most dysfunctional of dysfunctional families.)

The 4 people--Father, Mother & 2 adult sons--represent 16 possibilities of familial addictive relationship--addiction, co-dependency, enabling, etc. Everyone is addicted to something; with the mother it's shooting morphine, the father is an alcoholic & egotist & the sons are both alcoholics with physical & behavioral problems. The interplay between the family is often painful to watch, but they are snared together--probably because no one else would put up with them.

Hepburn is unflatteringly photographed and her mannerisms are distracting and annoying as well as her ""cheese grating"" voice.  Sir Ralph RIchardson, Stockwell and Robards do well by their roles but I just couldn't get to care about their characters because the film put me to sleep within ten minutes of watching it and I had to watch it in spurts (took me 17 days)to complete the viewing.",1198627200,4,556,4.770833333333333

Ralph Richardson is ideally cast as the fading family patriarch, while both Robards and Stockwell (O'Neill's proxy) are superb as the two sons, each consumed by their own afflictions. Hepburn executes a tour-de-force as the fragile, brain-addled Mary Tyrone, a spectral symbol of the family's decay from within.

Everything from the ground up, of this film is amazing: material - O'Neil's play is one of the finest pieces of drama ever written; the performances are first class - among them, and most notable, Katharine Hepburn - absolutely mind blowing, its staggering to think this is the same person that did The Iron Petticoat, however here Hepburn is in top form...at her brilliant best (which she was for most of her career, really only the occasional Iron Petticoat, Spitfire fiascos - other than that, the greatest actress ever. The director, Sidney Lumet does a fine job directing it simply, but effectively.

All this combined...makes this an incredible picture. One of the finest.

Something that is interesting that I noted while reading Hepburn's autobiography ""Me: Stories Of My Life"" is the fact that this was rehearsed for many weeks in a warehouse, and then shot largely in sequence so the actors could perform long scenes, instead of having to keep cutting. In the end, we are basically seeing a theatre quality performance. There is a very real, raw, live feel to it - strikingly effective.

As for what the other reviews said about poor dvd quality: I cant say I really noticed that at all. I found the WHOLE thing brilliant.",1160870400,7,1276,4.8173515981735155
472852,5,6302484499,"The 1962 classic film takes a drastic look inside a family that has various issues within the household. Immediately the audience is introduced to Katharine Hepburn, playing the role of the Mary Tyrone. She captures the role of a mother struggling with a morphine addiction perfectly. In the beginning of the film there are suspicions from other members of her family if she is staying clean. The father, played by Ralph Richardson, tries to keep concerns of the family away from his wife in order to help in her recovery. Richardson does a great job with his character in showing the audience the ongoing strain of a husband that has to deal with his wife's emotional rollercoaster she continually invites her family on. The eldest brother is smart. He is tired of pretending that everything is alright. He is tired of excusing his mother's behavior, and acting like his brother isn't nearly as sick as he looks. The youngest brother is suffering from the consumption and is grappling with his own sickness as well as his father's choice not to pay for a good doctor. The audience is over taken by the issues the family is working through, and the positions of each character in regards to what is taking place around them. There is a continuous motif of denial. Denial of emotions, issues, and acknowledging what is occurring inside the ""home"". The actors bring issues of drugs, alcohol, money and sickness to life in a time where topics examined in the film were not typical discussions for the dinner table. Despite the family's anger towards one another, it's obvious there is a basic need to come together. The cast is excellent and the story is fascinating making the overall film to be magnificent, and highly recommended.",1133222400,11,1730,4.828282828282828
472853,5,6302484499,"Sidney Lumet confessed without hindrances his profound admiration by the artistic presence of Carl Dryer and how his films determined and affianced his vocation as filmmaker. This brief introduction can help us to understand much better (thinking in the memorable Dryer ` Days of wrath) the final decision who guided to Lumet to undertake this awful and brutal living nightmare around the members of a family: She is an serious drug addict, her son alcoholic and the other is dying of tuberculosis.

With such premise it is so easy to imagine and conclude we will watch a complex picture loaded of visible depressive character and disturbing sordidness. The luxury cast was decisive to arrive to secure port. Katherine Hepburn and Richardson are more than admirable in this classic adaptation of Eugene O Neil, the merciless eye, the speaking trumpet of bad news, the ineffable inquirer of a society in crisis, like Baudelaire in France, Papini in Italy, Becket in Ireland or Strindberg in Sweden who reveled the harrowing Expressionism literary, showing the rotten entrails without piety.

Mature, haunting and powerful film that strikes over and over on our spotted conscience with an only objective, to beat the soul through the catastrophe for reaching the cathartic experience.",1132444800,7,1282,5.218446601941747

472855,5,6302484499,"This is likely Katharine Hepburn's greatest screen performance in a career that spanned over six decades. Tackling Eugene O'Neill's morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone must have been daunting at the time, but this 1962 film version of the playwright's autobiographical masterwork is a blazing showcase for not only her formidable talent but her male co-stars as well. Set right after the turn of the last century, it follows a summer day in the life of the Tyrones, as dysfunctional a family as one could possibly imagine. Ex-actor James Tyrone Sr. is the titular head of the family, a miserly alcoholic actor whose sanctimonious attitude has his family unable to cope with their feelings in constructive ways. His wife Mary is a faded beauty defiantly denying both her condition and that of her youngest son Edmund. Edmund has just returned from a few years on the seas but has contracted tuberculosis. Older son Jamie is a failed actor, a wastrel who has become an alcoholic and resentful of his father's stinginess in not being able to send Edmund to a good sanitarium.

The movie is really a series of confrontations and long recollections. As the story progresses, we learn that each of the family members, instead of bonding over Edmund's illness, is gradually retreating into private hellish worlds and that the inability to peacefully cohabitate stems from an inability to move on from events long passed. Even though they are all obviously intelligent people, they refuse to get past their disappointments, and we are left to witness the repercussions of how their choices have affected their relationships and most tragically, how their relationships have informed their choices. What makes spending three hours with this quartet worthwhile is the fact that O'Neill transcends the melodramatic aspects by honing in mercilessly on each one's strengths and frailties. He avoids the talkiness of a stage play by imbuing a sublimely lyrical use of language that captures a profound sense of beauty amid the overwhelming tragedy.

Director Sidney Lumet remains faithful to the text and emphasizes the play's substantial dramatic force by focusing very specifically on the four actors. Hepburn's head-shaking was beginning around this time, and it actually feeds effectively into the character's constant sense of loss and paranoia. She has several great moments, such as Mary's giggly remembrance of her first encounter with James and the demented stupor she displays near the end as she carries her old wedding dress around. A somewhat rigid Ralph Richardson plays James Sr. with appropriate stentorian fervor, though honestly I would have liked to have seen either Fredric March, who originated the role on Broadway, or ironically Spencer Tracy play this role, especially as the play deals heavily with Irish Catholic guilt. Jason Robards has been so inextricably connected with O'Neill in the intervening years that it is no surprise to see him superbly interpret the role of Jamie with alternate flashes of fury and poignancy. As Edmund, Dean Stockwell is a revelation as the O'Neill doppelganger, the emotional core of the play who takes the family's one positive step of forgiving his father and brother for their faults in the climax. Additional credit needs to be given to cinematographer Boris Kaufman whose fluid work here makes the camera an integral part of the experience by lending depth and range to the scenes that could not have been captured onstage. True, it can be an emotionally draining film for the uninitiated, but it is more importantly, a powerful realization of one of the undisputed classics of the American stage.",1118880000,29,3641,5.169491525423729
472856,5,6302484499,"This is Eugene O'Neil's masterpiece faithfully brought to the screen. Katherine Hepburn as the dope fiend mother (Mary) is simply outstanding - she transcends her role as actress to some other level beyond that: one of those rare moments in movies (Brando at times has done it and Olivier in Shakespearean roles). Ralph Richardson plays the skin flint, pompous husband (James); Jason Robards is the alcoholic son (Jamie); and Dean Stockwell is the son (Edmund) dying of TB. It's stagey, of course, in that fog-enshrouded house by the sea, but to see these people lash out at each other in pain and bitter misunderstanding, and then lick at each other's wounds, is devastating. [The play is semi-autobiographical, and during the writing, O'Neil left off each day in tears and an emotional wreck.] Definitely worth a watch.",1113609600,7,821,5.044117647058823
472857,5,6302484499,"Playwright Eugene O'Neill is credited with single-handedly elevating the American dramatic stage play to a respectable level in the early 20th century, thanks to such timeless works as ""The Iceman Cometh,"" ""Mourning Becomes Electra,"" and ""Anna Christie.""  This autobiographical work was published long after his death, earned a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1957, and was filmed on a small budget in 1962 with Katharine Hepburn starring, who sought out the role with her typical vigor.

The director was Sidney Lumet, whose only previous major work was his theatrical debut, ""12 Angry Men,"" with Henry Fonda.  He had also done a TV version of O'Neill's ""The Iceman Cometh"" in 1960.  Just two years after this film he made ""The Pawnbroker"" with Rod Steiger, but it was the '70s before his career warped into high gear with such great films as ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Network,"" ""Prince Of the City,"" and ""The Verdict.""  Did I mention he's one of my favorite directors?

The material O'Neill provides here is heavily psychological, as he basically puts his own family on stage and peels away their outer facades, layer by layer.  From the start we see that there are conflicts in every relationship within this family consisting of the aging actor and patriarch, his fragile wife of 36 years who's never been interested in theater, O'Neill's drunkard second-rate actor of a brother, and the baby of the family (O'Neill himself), and over the course of the 3 hours we share with this most dysfunctional of groups we see them walking on eggshells, then accidentally bruising one another and profusely apologizing, and ultimately savaging one another in the throes of drug and drink.

That sounds quite unappealing, but in the hands of a master like O'Neill we truly get to know these characters, their lives, their fears, their aspirations, and their souls.  And Lumet's direction, choosing to limit the film to a fairly strict stage-faithful interpretation of the material, is as striking as ever, dollying slowly into a screen-filling closeup of the characters at moments when they are ultimately being revealed or, alternately, occasionally dollying down the hallway or down to the beach to show us the characters in a wordless revelation of their loneliness.  In the later parts of the film his camera is often shooting from floor level as the characters tower over one another, dominating one another in mind, body, and soul.  Beautiful, understated work, typical of Lumet.

Sir Ralph Richardson plays the aging star of stage, based on O'Neill's father, who made a career of playing ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""  His emotive performance perfectly fits such a ""Master Thespian,"" and he is as commanding a miserly patriarch as there ever was.  Hepburn's delicate and demanding performance as O'Neill's mother is a roller coaster ride that ends in the night of madness, her family spent and helpless to aid her.  Jason Robards, who reprised this role in the TV-theatre sequel ""A Moon For the Misbegotten,"" is absolutely dead on as the wasted young man who lives down to his father's expectations and bares his soul more painfully than the others.  And young Dean Stockwell shows how lazily he performed on TV's ""Quantum Leap"" many years later, here playing a nuanced and delicate character whose role often is to simply react to those around him; he's the baby of the family, the playwright as a young man who's not yet a playwright, seeing his world change for the worse right before his eyes.

It's a monumental work, this play and this film.  Its title, like the best such work, is both literal and figurative.  It's likely to leave you wrung out emotionally, so be prepared; it's worth the work on the viewer's part.",1108080000,12,3725,4.9790322580645165
472858,5,6302484499,"The text of the O'Neill play is the greatest of all his works and potentially the greatest American play of the 20th Century. Turning it into a film took a lot of courage since this is a play of internal struggle and there is very little to ""see"" in terms of action. This is a series of conversations between family members, all of whom are tortured and who are completely unable to deal with each other's failures and/or shortcomings.

Rightfully, many reviewers have lauded Katherine Hepburn's and Ralph Richardson's performances as the parents of two adult sons. They are masterful performances. And certainly Jason Robards, Jr.  established himself as a premier interpreter of O'Neill with his interpretation of Jamie, the older son. I think Dean Stockwell's performance is often underrated. Since the character is less well defined in the text, he had to draw his character from the other characters interactions with him. This is extremely difficult to do and yet he is the focus of the family on that particular Long Day. He is to be commended for providing a strong anchor for the others to pull and push on. When Stockwell as Edmund says ""Stammering is the native eloquence of us fog people,"" you truly understand how deeply lost he is in a family of lost souls.

This is a wonderfully moody work, filmed with great care and precision. The music is haunting and performed by a solo piano rather than a full orchestra. The single voice of the piano adds to the emptiness of the family and their inability to face any of their demons with resolve.

Not everyone will enjoy this film. It is sad, depressing, black and white, no great action, and incredibly long, but I recommend it to everyone with an interest in family dynamics, brilliant acting, remarkable writing, and/or creative film-making.",1103932800,12,1803,4.8441558441558445
472859,5,6302484499,"O'Neill's last and greatest play, which was not to be produced during his lifetime because it was so personal, has made a successful transition to film.  Mainly a succession of dialogues between different members of the family, like most O'Neill the play is long and often redundant. However, this is excused by the brilliance of the language, the raw emotion, and the depth of characterization.  ""Night"" is O'Neill forgiving his family and telling them that he loves them.  It is intense, unrelenting, and painful.  However, at the same time, O'Neill wrote some scenes of comic relief, also.  There are speeches of great poetry (e.g., Edmund telling his father about his sea adventures).

Katherine Hepburn is perfect in the role of Mary.  It is said that she wanted the part badly, and took a large cut in pay in order to get it.  Her quirky hand and facial movements define the character.  I was a bit disappointed with Ralph Richardson's performance.  He is a fine actor, but in this vehicle he is supposed to play an Irishman who worked hard to lose his brogue.  But in the film, he speaks with his nasal, English accent**.  Dean Stockwell is fine as the sickly Edmund who has a complex relationship with his brother, Jamie.  Jason Robards, Jr., reprises his off-Broadway triumph in the role of the dissolute, unambitious Jamie, James' eldest son.

This is playwrighting at its finest.  The film script sticks close to the original.  I admire O'Neill for his forays into different experiments in his plays.  But ""night"" proves that you write best when you write about what you know about

**NOTE:  Seeing the film several times since I wrote this, I think I was a little too hard on Richardson's performance.  It is absolutely perfect, just like Hepburn's is...even though his English accent still seems a little off...but maybe I'm wrong!!",1103241600,4,1845,4.871382636655949

Mary Tyrone is the hub of this play by O'Neill and as Mary unravels so does the family.  Katharine Hepburn's Mary begins as bright and shiny and lovely as a new penny and as she succombs to her addiction she begins to blur -- her hair begins to straggle, her wrist sleeves used to cover the needle tracks begin to come undone just as her mind and the family fabric is beginning to come undone.  When Mary/Kate walks down the long hallway with all of the sadness and weariness of her situation etched on her face, you can feel the hopelessness that she feels as you know that she is going to climb those stairs to the blessed oblivion of the morphine.  That beautiful, sad, lost woman breaks your heart just as she broke the hearts of her men and they in turn broke her heart.  Richardson, Robards, and Stockwell were up to the task of acting at the same level as Kate Hepburn and with Lumet's direction, they made a masterpiece.",1101772800,3,1103,4.573604060913706
472909,5,6302484499,"I can't imagine any other actress' performance  equating with that of Katherine Hepburn.  It was marvelous.  The movie captured the sullen mood complete with the symbolic fog that languished in the air.  It was appropo to the long dark night that reflected characters' torment.  Each character did a fabulous job.  For those who enjoy dramatic plays, you won't even notice the 3 hours enhanced with lengthy profound dialogues.

This fascinating dramatic play focuses on the life of an addicted, dysfunctional family that suffers greatly with their demons of the past. Eugene O'Neill's 1940 autobiographical story takes place in one long day and proceeds into the brooding night. It is a courageous account of the tortured soul and his haunted family.

The movie performance and script was very close to the book.

In the book's dedication to his wife, O'Neil writes, ""I give you the original script of this play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.""

The setting is August 1912, at the summer home where the fog lays heavily, foghorns blow loud contrasting with the chime of bells. The mood is somber just like the symbolic recurring fog that impairs vision and obscures reality. The bells are symbolic of the convent where the main character Mary Tyrone was happiest.

The focus of the family is Mary, 54, wife, mother of two sons, wife of Tyrone. At the beginning, we are left to imagine and second guess what is bothering Mary and later it is clearly defined that she is addicted to morphine. Mary lives in the past, where she was in a convent and had a dream to be a concert pianist.

James Tyrone, 65, an alcoholic known by his family as a miser, and whose real concern was to invest money into property rather then family because of a nagging fear from his childhood days -the threat of the poorhouse. He was considered a handsome stage actor and regrets what he could have been,- a great Shakespearean actor.

Jamie Tyrone - the elder 34 year old son, another alcoholic always labeled a loser by his parents. He has a love-hate relationship with his younger brother Edmund as Jamie's confesses that because of his own hatred of himself, his role was to make his younger brother a failure too.

Edmund Tyrone - 24-year old son is a reader of great literature and an aspiring poet. He has tuberculosis and with concern wonders whether his miser father will send him to a shabby institution. Eugene O'Neill is the real-life character of Edmund.

O'Neill provides readers with more than adequate stage direction; we get a real sense of the way we are to interpret the readings including the shifting moods. This is the proverbial ""can't-put-it-down-type book"" ....MzRizz",1097193600,3,2679,4.831509846827133

That wouldn't be so bad had they done a new transfer, but this looks like the same one used for the VHS tape. Cropped for the TV screen like the video release, (this was definitely shot in widescreen, according to imdb.com), it's got the same gritty, low-res quality.

472911,4,6302484499,"one another's shortcoming but never takes that long, hard look into the mirror of self-introspection. This adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play is dry and slow moving. It's a slow building sizzle of failed lives and interactions exploding and unraveling between well intentioned family members. I would compare its dynamics to 'Relfections In A Golden Eye' (Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Harris) in its pace and temperament.

Everyone needs to be in analysis. Everyone is love-starved and in need of some attention. Everyone uses the failings of others to avoid the failings of their own lives. So we drown in the drama of people and families, like us, who can't extract themselves from the web of their inability to take control of their lives. We see how ineffectual and pointless we become when we depend upon others to fill in the black holes of our emptiness and sense of helplessness.

One has to be in the mood to watch 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' It's demanding and draining. Yet I always find it a fascinating and insightful viewing. The tragedy of the 'American Dream' and its incompatibility with real life is probably the lesson here. We fill our heads with false expectations, then insulate ourselves from our innate needs and responsibility for our own lives, and end up an unnatural and pathetic shadow of what we might have been.

I've never seen Olivier's version, so I can't compare one to the other. Each film has those who hail one or the other, sometimes at the expense of the other, as the best version. I'll probably buy it down the road so that I know. I think the film good enough to spend the money on a second version.

Like 'Reflections In A Golden Eye,' 'Long Day's Journey Into Night' remains one of my favorite films. I really appreciate the human drama of dealing with our shortcomings and stifled desires. I highly recommend both films, and hope to see ""Reflections' on dvd soon.",1095984000,13,1925,4.806646525679758
472912,5,6302484499,"No doubt this filming of Eugene O'Neill's epic play will not appeal to everyone (though there are suggestions of drugs, sex & violence...) This is, in effect, an exact filming of O'Neill's play, masterfully directed by a younger Sidney Lumet (Network, Murder on the Orient Express, etc.), and his trademark of generous close-ups is haunting. This is apt, since the entire cast won top acting honors at Cannes. Indeed, aside from the autobiographical train of events, the acting is, without exception, brilliant. This is one of Robards' first film roles, as well as Stockwell, and their performances are multi-layered and mesmerizing. Also, Ralph Richardson's role fits him like a glove. The most remarkable performance is from Katherine Hepburn...as a morphine addict? Wow! I remember reading interviews years ago where Hepburn admitted that she was scared to death of the utter complexity of the role. She was at a point in her career where she was worried that no one would take her seriously, or that she'd fall short in creating any of the many facets of the character. Well, it's complete! Affection, cynicism, duality, suspicion, and her deep trips into her past, not to mention that she's aware that her life's gone to hell...it's overwhelming. The play/film is episodic, but this is OK because it gives wonderful interaction among all characters (even Jeanne Barr, as the goofy housekeeper). It's all very atmospheric and quite profound, thanks to Lumet's understanding of his material. Andre Previn's unobtrusive score properly conveys ""dysfunction"" when necessary. At three hours, the time flies by, thanks to impeccable production values, and acting, captured on film, that any true aficianado will cherish. Sure, it's artsy, but it would be hard to present O'Neill any other way. I usually prefer widescreen, but the close-ups may actually benefit from this full-screen version.

Leave it for those who can appreciate the extreme tension and release that are created by these wonderful characters.  _A Long Day's Journey Into Night_ is an emotional descent, a painful adventure into the lives of one family who has plenty of skeletons in the closet.  Katharine Hepburn is superb playing a mother addicted to morphine, administered to her after the birth of her son, Edmund.  This event looms over the entire movie, creating tension and anger between each member of the cast.
Yet, when we ask ourselves why each of the characters has drowned themselves in alcohol, an interesting notion arises.  All of them use Hepburn's character as an excuse to begin drinking again, brought on by their painful realization that she is still addicted to morphine.  And yet, I don't get the sense that anyone really wants to give up his or her own habit.  In fact, one gets the feeling that they almost hope Hepburn's character relapses so that they can continue to justify their own need.  Every character gains the audience's sympathy in this film, only to be destroyed by the memories of another character on stage.  While I agree with those who believe that this sort of film is overdone, alcohol loosening the inhibitions of those in the film so that an open and free dialogue can continue long into the night, I think that it is nevertheless a real and emotional genre.
Despite all of its wonderful qualities, _A Long Day's Journey Into Night_ is certainly true to its name-long.  One gets the sense that it is being shot in real-time.

I think this presentation was a tad overdone for my taste.  Many times I found myself cringing during her lines.  I did, however, enjoy the book, where I could interpret the character to my own liking.  Perhaps that was why I didn't some of the performances.  In my mind they were less dramatic.  It wasn't all bad, the young man portraying Edmund did put on a heartfelt and believable performance.

472918,4,6302484499,"After reading ""A Long Day's Journey into Night"" by Eugene O'Neill, and later watching the movie, I got a good idea of what I expected, but the movie went beyond my expectations. Katherine Hepburn portayed Mary Tyrone, cursed with a morphine addiction. Hepburn was the perfect choice for this movie, as she did a stupendous job of displaying random emotions as if she were actually on morphine. The believability is amazing. Although Mary's role was played extremely well, the others are not too deserving of praise. James Tyrone, the miserly Irish-Catholic who cries poor house to everyone, is portrayed by an unfit actor who needed much improvement. Tyrone (Ralph Richardson) needed to have been a little more extreme with his temper, which I interpreted from the play to be as a short fuse. Although I found the movie and the play to be extremely boring and morbid, it does an excellent job of showing, in American literature, the best display of acting, realism, and (ironically) truth behind Eugene O'Neill.",1067472000,5,1011,4.988165680473373

The actors could have done better job and the play doesn't seem to be brought alive it more died right away as it started.  There was some very poor acting and the crying as well as Mary being a morphine adact didn't seem real enough.  I have seen morphine adacts and how she played her role seemed more like a lunatic or a nut out of a nut house then someone addicted to morphine.

The music used in the movie set the tone better for the time period and the black and white color. Each character had very good performances, from miserly Tyrone to morbid Edmund. Mary(Hepburn) was her best performance. In the movie the show parts that could not be dipicted in the book by showing images better of the beach seen ,and showing each characters emotions better.

472993,5,6302484499,"Long Day's Journey into Night combines a classic play with a talented cast of actors to create a striking cinematic version of Eugene O'Neill's drama and life.  The movie depictions of a day in the lives of the Tyrone family provide an effective, dark look at the flawed characters O'Neill created from his own life many years ago.  Katherine Hepburn's Mary is more intense on screen that the printed word could convey.  She produces a scary visual of the personal and family damage done by addiction.  Director Sidney Lumet reinforces the edgy, frayed tension, doubt and despair with his individual shots and with his ability to capture the character interactions in this troubled family.  I appreciate the depth of O'Neill's work and how wrenching it must be to lay his life and soul open for all to see.  Whether you know the play or not, the movie is a riveting look at a family the reader and viewer know is in crisis, through the eyes of an author, a member of that family, who came to realize the crisis himself.",1067385600,5,1019,4.633333333333334
472994,5,6302484499,"Eugene O'Neill and his masterpiece were honored in this movie.  This is the core of what movies and acting in general used to be, before all the special effects and stunt doubles.  These actors are the epitome of what it is to become the character you portray.  Catherine Hepburn's mood constatly changing, coupled with the physical and verbal actions of the others, makes the play absolutely stunning.  Words that, when read on paper, would seem repetitive and dull if not well acted (namely the several thousand 'God''Oh God''Jesus Christ' comments in the play).  The plot is simply extraordinary, taking the type of problems in most families and expanding them to the extreme.  The descent into misery is shown in such a way as to make you love and hate each character.  When the play finally ends you are left with a horrifying feeling, yet a refreshing look on life is soon to follow.  Every person should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime, simply because it is a classic.  No extra gadgets, no computer animation, not even color.  Just the actors and their props.
One final word of advice to anyone who wishes to see this movie:
The music, it starts in one direction and then spins off into another and another, much as this seemingly normal family spirals into chaos.  Don't stray because the music hurts your ears, because at the end you will think it is the greatest masterpiece youve heard in a long time.  Happy viewing!",1067385600,3,1446,4.717131474103586

All of the characters with the exception of one, acted with some of the best emotion that I have ever seen in movies of that era. The exception that I am referring to in my last statement was Ralph Richardson's portrayal of James Tyrone. I think the casting directors could have picked a better individual to portray James Tyrone. He preformed his part with emotion, but it was nothing of what I expecting. The image I received from the play was nothing close to what Ralph Richardson had performed.  The play depicted Tyrone as a handsome older gentleman, which Richardson was far from unfortunately. Also in the play Tyrone seemed to have an irritable temper. Richardson's was a little temperamental but it just was not what I was expecting, it could have been just a little more intense. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it was a little long at times, but almost all movies are slow at times. Their use of sound effects greatly added to the emotions that they were trying to implement into the different scenes. The producers and directors also did a wonderful job with the cinematography, it greatly added to the mood of the movie in general.  So, if you enjoy the classics and do not enjoy seeing them butchered (as some other productions have done), I would strongly recommend watching this movie.",1067385600,,1453,4.831325301204819
472996,4,6302484499,"Eugene O'Neil's autobiographical play, Long Day's Journey Into Night, gives readers great insight into the life of America's greatest playwrite.  The harsh reality of the ups and downs of O'Neil's life are realistically portrayed in the 1962 production, starring Katherine Hepburn.  Hepburn's performance as O'Neil's morphine addicted mother is stellar and moving.  Hepburn and the rest of the cast brought this Pulitzer Prize-winning play to life.  This dramitization of O'Neil's play allowed viewers to feel the characters' hope and despair, love and hate, and triumph and defeat.
  O'Neil's plays were a radical, theatrical departure from the ""norm"" of society for that era.  His works revolutionized the theater by bringing to the forefront the concept of realism and used his own family and life experiences as the model.  O'Neil's family was the epitome of a disfuntional family, as seen in his mother's morphine addiction, his father and brother's alcoholism, and his own battle with tuberculosis.  Although an example of the extremes, Long Day's Journey Into Night presented the realism of family life, i.e. sibling rivalry as seen between Jamie and Edmund and the generation differences felt between Tyrone and his sons shown by their choices of literature and views of life in general.
  Although the topic is unpleasant and the reality of it is harsh, O'Neil accomplished his goal of presenting life in it's truest form, using a firsthand account as his source of inspiration.  Expertly presented by this all-star cast, O'Neil's play and the 1962 version of Long Day's Journey Into Night is a production worth viewing.",1067385600,2,1629,5.2957198443579765

As it was taken from a play, you would figure that lines would be changed and scenes would be removed, however this was not the case. This is a verbatim film of the the play. All of the actors fit the charactors they played perfectly. They all did wonderfully and in their ""angry scenes"" they looked believebly angry. Personally, i thought that the play waS depressing as you watch the family fall apart you want to reach out and ""say come together and support each other,"" but this does not happen and you see that there is so much conflict and pent up anger that this family needs a lot of counseling. With Mary being a morphing addict and the three men being alcoholics, it is a truely depressing play. You can feel the emotion of the actors as they speak.

Seeing the movie truely changed my perspective.  Everything from the cinematography to the actors fit O'Neill's play like a glove.  Usually when a play makes the transition to a screenplay there are many lines changed, characters omitted and parts taken out, but for this movie that is not the case.  It was like you were seeing Eugene O'Neill's exact memory of his childhood.  Katherine Hepburn gave one of the best performances that I have witnessed in any entertainment medium.  Her portrayle of Mary Tyrone was so deeply moving that you truely felt that she was a victim of morphine addiction.  It was absolutly genius the way she was able to get so deep into character that she could change from one emotion to the polar opposite within the blink of an eye.  Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards, and Dean Stockwell fit their characters to a tee.  Their emotional speeches throughout the play make you feel sympathy for their characters.  Their acting is so flawless and realistic that you forget they are actors and for three hours truely believe that they are the Tyrones.  Though I was not quite so deeply moved by the play itself, the movie is worth watching just for the performances.  This is definitly a movie to watch if you want to have a good cry.",1067299200,3,1400,4.692622950819672
472999,5,6302484499,"The movie Long Day's Journey into Night is a triumphant endeavor to portray O'Neill's autobiographical play. The actors do justice with their characters. Katharine Hepburn is simply astounding; she makes Mary Tyrone's morphine addiction seem so convincing. Her acting captivates the audience and envelops them in a cloud of gloom. O'Neill's intended depiction of Mary Tyrone is almost perfectly acted out by Hepburn. It is apparent in the movie that Hepburn's character is nervous about something; Hepburn's entrancing talent brings out the best in Mary Tyrone's despondent character. Hepburn's marvelous work, however, does not overshadow the performances of the actors who play Edmund, Jamie, and Tyrone. Sir Ralph Richardson plays Tyrone and gives a stunning performance; Tyrone's stinginess is perceptible from the way he moves about the room searching for a light bulb to switch off and the manner in which he scrutinizes the amount of whiskey in the bottle. Jason Robards Jr. almost flawlessly portrays the alcoholic Jamie Tyrone; I had not pictured Jamie in any other way. Dean Stockwell's ill-fated Edmund is perhaps one of the best performances I have seen on motion picture.
The movie does an excellent job of establishing an environment of gloom throughout the course of the play; the morbid milieu that the dysfunctional Tyrone family lives in would sadden even the most stoic of men. I was moved to pity for Eugene O'Neill after watching the movie. How did he manage to live in such a miserable atmosphere? One can feel the wretchedness augmenting as the day drearily moves into night. This movie ranks among the best dramas ever filmed and it would move sentimental hearts to tears. I would recommend this movie to those people who believe that life is treating them miserably (Wait till you see this!). This is a great movie to watch over the weekend (It is over three hours long! Every minute, nevertheless, is worth watching.). I guarantee that the thrilling performances and the direction of the movie will impress you. This movie is saturated with realistic emotions and it gives the viewer a true understanding of why Eugene O'Neill was and is America's greatest playwright.",1067212800,10,2194,5.131284916201118
473000,5,6302484499,"After reading Eugene O'Neil's play, I felt I understood, but not fully.  Long dialouges between characters could be seen only so much through the reading itself.  Interpretations of expressions of the characters is vital to understand the many emotions they dealt with in the span of only one day.  Love, hate, sickness, resentment, forgiveness and regret are just a few of the emotions that might have to be covered in only a couple lines of dialouge.  To accomplish this talented acting is needed, and in this production, was achieved.  The characters seemed weird to me because they were constantly jumping back and forth between emotions and appeared sort of crazy.  I realized that this illustrated the many different emotions they all felt for themselves and eachother, and the effects of extreme addiction, which I had never been exposed to before. Hepburn demonstrated not just how morphine effects a person directly after they take it, but what it is like to live an entire day in adverse states and emotions.  The actors' most important skill throughout the play was their ability to change emotions with the snap of a finger, and wear those emotions right on their sleeve.  This brought to life the troubled and hectic lives led by the Tyrone family.",1067212800,2,1261,4.943127962085308

Because his widow relented and gave her permission for this ""play of old sorrow written in tears and blood"" we are left with this 1962 film and Katharine Hepburn's greatest acting performance. I first stumbled upon this film on late night television twenty years ago and I still remember staying up and crying throughout the emotionally devastating conclusion with the camera slowly pulling back from the family sitting around the table before a stunning series of emotional close ups of the doomed Tyrones.
This painfully autobiographical play is set on the long day and night in 1912 when the Tyrone family deals the news that young Edmund (Dean Stockwell) has tuberculosis. The tragedy is compounded by the rest of the family: a father (Ralph Richardson) who is a miser, a brother (Jason Robards, Jr., repeating his stage performance) who finds solace in drink, and a mother who retreats into her addiction to morphine before the night is over. Writing about his own family, O'Neill not only changed their last names to Tyrone but also switched Eugene with Edmund, the name of the infant brother who died. After watching this heartbreakingly painful story you know why the playwright wanted it tucked away until he was long gone.
Hepburn received her ninth Oscar nomination for her role as Mary Tyrone (the award went to Anne Bancroft for ""The Miracle Worker""), and the four actors shared the acting award for the Cannes Film Festival along with the principals of ""A Taste of Hone"" (no clue how they came to that strange pairing). The almost 3-hour film is the complete O'Neill script (the key selling point for Hepburn in taking the role) and was shot by director Sidney Lumet in sequence in 37 days after the cast rehearsed for three weeks. The music score is by Andre Previn and Boris Kaufman was the cinematographer of this black and white film. O'Neill is enjoying something of a revival thanks to Kevin Spacey in ""The Iceman Cometh"" on Broadway, but when it comes to film this is far and away the best representation of his work. Given that he wrote extremely long plays about the early part of the last century, it is likely we will never see a greater film version of O'Neill than ""Long Day's Journey Into Night.""
Interesting background tidbit: Hepburn tried to talk Spencer Tracy into taking the role of the father. Tracy, who was already in failing health, turned it down, claiming it was a question of salary (Hepburn received only $25,000 for her part). Some of Tracy's biographers, wondering how one of the greatest actors of the century would have done with one of the greatest plays, have suggested that Tracy was intimidated by the role.

I did so because at the moment I am studying the life of Fredric March, and this was one of the plays he performed in his theatre career. I wanted to know what the play was about. He had played the role of the father in the stage version.
Anyway...this is a LONG film and I had to watch it in two evenings. It seemed depressing to me from the very beginning, and seemed to slide you farther and farther down into the hopelessness of their lives as the film went on. I am not a fan of films that are so dark, so sad, so hopeless...it is no joy to watch a dysfunctional family such as this. They are a strange bunch...at times seeming to care for each other and saying a kind or loving word to each other, but in the next breath they are saying very hurtful words that cut to the heart. I could not believe how this pattern of ""I love you I hate you"" dialog went on and on in the movie. Obviously they are all deeply troubled people, and unable to really help each other. I did not care for the swearing in the movie, or all the times the name of God was used in vain. I must say I did not really LIKE this film at all...it was too hopeless, and for it to end them no better off than they were in the beginning, well you just sit there and wonder, ""What was the purpose of telling us this story?"" You cannot feel anything but sadness at their hopelessness, you are wanting to do nothing but to cry for this family.
While I did not like the story, I will say the actors did a good job of portraying their characters...Katherine Hepburn stood out to me most of all; she seemed the most tragic figure in the family. This film was definately very real...there are people who do function like this in their relations to one another. Yet personally, I like to see a film where in the end the characters have grown or have learned something to better themselves...in other words I prefer to feel some hope for them in the end.

Presented in its entirety by a brilliant cast, this excruciating journey into pain and remembrance is not to be missed by those who love great writing and great acting.
This is arguably the finest cast to perform this work.  Many have commented that this is Katherine Hepburn's greatest performance.  Watching her Mary Tyrone succumbing once more to her drug addiction and slipping away...away..., is devastating.  I would like to recommend Ralph Richardson's James Tyrone as the definitive portrayal.  I have seen Olivier and Jack Lemmon and others tackle the role, but no one ever got the Old Ham's pomposity and penny-pinching pettiness with such sympathy for the old man's history and sheer human-ness in his weaknesses and foibles.  It is an indelible performance.
Jason Robards made his name in the role of Jamey Tyrone on Broadway, and it is a polished performance we get here.  Dean Stockwell is fine as Edmund, it is just not as juicy a role being more catalyst and reaction to the others.
As we watch these people peel back the layers of love and hate and resentment and old hurts and envy and jealously, while also exposing their great love and need for each other, we are watching Eugene O'Neill peel back the history and deep wounds of his own family with an unflinching honesty akin to watching him peel his own hide off to expose the blood and nerves and sinew beneath.  Hell yes it is painful, because he is dissecting and examining the lifelong hurts and pain that only those close to us can inflict, those wounds and scars carried the full extent of a lifetime.
There is no better writing or acting to be found than what you will find here.  Sidney Lumet's direction does not get in the way, and the black & white photography is appropriate to the mood and effect of the piece.  Though laced with black Irish humor throughout, this is nonetheless a brutally honest tragedy of loss and sadness.  Written with ""tears and blood""...no kidding!

Hot Toasty Rag, November 10, 2017

In Eugene ONeills play, Katharine Hepburn plays the fragile, weak matriarch in a highly dysfunctional family. Just as the title implies, the entire story takes place during one day, and just as the title implies, its an incredibly long day. Ralph Richardson is the pontificating former actor who longs for his glory days, Jason Robards is the hard-drinking older son with contempt for every member of his family, and Dean Stockwell is the youngest son whos ill but has just as much of a temper as his healthier counterpart.

While the family awaits the doctors diagnosis of Deans persistent cough, they're also watchful of Kate. Shes in perpetual denial, refusing to believe her son is sick, refusing to acknowledge her former battle with morphine addiction, and refusing to admit tat she might be succumbing to temptation again. Each actor has long, boring monologues that don't contribute to the plot; each actor has long, emotional outbursts that show the audience a highly trained therapist probably couldn't help them. This is the type of play that people who say, I don't like plays refer to.

While there are plenty of reasons that could make you feel like you should watch this filmfamous actors, famous playwright, famous directorthere isn't really any reason to watch it if you're actually looking for an enjoyable evening.

Hepburn, I think, gives the best performance of her career. I have read O'Neill's biography giving me a greater appreciation of his plays. Bluray  b&w nice and sharp. Arrived on time.

If you are here reading reviews, you likely have read other reviews of praises about this movie.

Blu-ray:
You'll see that there are numerous praises about the bluray disc.  I have a completely different point of view.  Original aspect of the movie was 4:3...like traditional TV screen format.  The bluray is in widescreen format.  But, what they have done to achieve this is to cut out top and bottom of the original movie!  I've first watched this movie on Youtube which is in original aspect of 4:3.  Then I bought the bluray and noticed that something wasn't right.  So, while I had this movie playing on my widescreen TV, I turned on my computer and played the original movie on Youtube.  Bluray contains full from from side to side but cuts out top and bottom for the entire duration of the film.  This is very disappointing.  For those who appreciate and want to have something that is original, I'd just buy the DVD version rather than the Bluray version.

Movie:
It's the bleakest and heartbreaking film I've ever seen.  Sure, there are heartbreaking stories about imaginable things on film.  Heartbreaking love story.  Heartbreaking family affairs.  Stories of triumph despite the odds and so on.  But, this movie is at another level from anything I've ever seen.  This movie is at least part autobiographical of what really happened to Eugene O'Neill in real life before he went to a sanatorium to get treated for tuberculosis.  His real father, mother and older brother's names were James, Mary and Jamie respectively just like the film.  Eugene O'Neill's name in the film was changed to Edmond.  Beyond the heartbreaking situation of mother's morphine addiction, father's tremendous miserliness, older brother's failure to find any decent place in life/alcoholism and Eugene character's illness of tuberculosis which often was a death sentence back in those days, what makes this story so heartbreaking is that each character has understanding of what is wrong with them.  Self realization of the pathetic and bleak situation they are in is what truly makes this story a real complex, deep, sorrowful beyond words and the most bleak story I've ever come across.

As for actors' performances, Katharine Hepburn's performance is just awesome.  Just tremendous how she portrays the mood swings morphine addicts go through...irritable lows and lazy/hazy highs.  If you notice, she wears a sleeve covers on her forearm (which is not part of the dress she wears...her dress sleeves come down to about the elbows).  I thought this was a bit odd.  But, if you read about what the withdrawal phase of morphine addiction is like, you'll learn that some people have itchiness.  So, she probably scratched her self to the level of bleeding and scarring in her forearms which the costume demonstrates.  Her tone of voices change depending on the mood she's in....it's fantastic.  Father character and Jami's character acting are a bit stagey.  Edmond character's performance is excellent and realistic.",1490572800,2,3035,5.044265593561368
