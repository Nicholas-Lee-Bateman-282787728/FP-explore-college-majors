4235202,4,B003ZSHLPG,"...and great to see him back in action!  If you like his basic persona you should find it easy enough to pass the time with the show. Basically Episodes is about a British couple, Sean and Beverly, who've put out a successful series in England and are offered a chance to do the show in the U.S.  They take the trip to Hollywood only to find the producer wants to change the show ""a bit"" and plants Matt LeBlanc as the lead. As the whole character of the original show is altered, causing a lot of friction in the lives of Sean and Beverly, the question of whether it will work or not becomes a focal point that unfolds as the characters get adjusted to the network's plans and Matt LeBlanc himself.

I liked the show for the most part.  While Merc, the network exec, is portrayed as a glutton and a heel, the real villain to the show is Sean's wife Beverly.  Rather than feeling her frustration with the network, I mostly just felt frustration with her!  Understandably it's her show that is getting destroyed in order to satisfy the demands of the industry, but she never comes off as a sympathetic character - quite the opposite actually - condescending, snobby, pretentious and annoying aptly descibe.  No sex appeal - a dominating woman. I felt sorry for her husband.

I'm not sure how great she and LeBlanc's chemistry is, though perhaps good chemistry is not the point here, since she hates the idea of having LeBlanc on the show from the start.  On the other hand, her husband Sean quickly becomes the voice of reason in all this - he and Joey (excuse me, Matt LeBlanc) hit it off fairly well adding the necessary element of 'friends' to the show.

""Episodes"" isn't perfect, but it's watchable. It doesn't quite have the same energy as Friends or Joey, but it moves at a fast pace and I was never bored with it though I think it would have been better if they'd found a better female lead. In one scene she's actually kicking him and you can see a bit of genuine irritablity rising in him - which made me wonder just for a second what Matt LeBlanc would be like in a role that was completely non-comedic.

I was disappointed it's not on Prime or Netflix yet so more people who don't want to specifically purchase every season can discover it. I hope Showtime will allow it to be streamed because I'm stunned by how few people have ever heard of it. The best way to describe it is dry British humor plus Entourage plus Joey from Friends.

4235265,3,B003ZSHLPG,"A different twist for a sit-com for sure.  English couple are the more amusing part of the show.  Still think of Matt LaBlanc as Joey unfortunately, altho he plays himself.  Too much reliability on foul language and sex jokes.  Able to shake the stereo-type from Rachel's character somehow Jennifer A. has been able to do that.",1412380800,,327,4.785714285714286

If I could have given it 2 1/2 stars, I would have done that.  It's pretty crude.  The language is appalling, as are all of the sexual shennanigans. (sigh) But Matt LeBlanc (as his ficitionalized self - I do *hope* it's fictionalized!)  is somehow charming and somewhere deep inside that big lug there is a genuine heart, and that's what keeps the thing going. There are plenty of inside jokes about the world of Show Biz and its stereotypical characters, so for anyone who's ever been exposed to that world (as I have in a small way) - there are belly laughs. The relationship between the show's married writers is a kind of breath of fresh air (most of the time, but not always.)

Sterling performances all around, but the show never made me care that much about the characters. The idea of Matt LeBlanc sending himself up sounds hip, but how many points can you get for playing yourself?

4235309,4,B003ZSHLPG,"'Episodes' is a promising piece of television that probably needs time to grow into itself. A British couple with a hit comedy series are lured to LA to make an Americanised version (insert comparison to 'The Office' here). The premise of this first series is their immediate and total disillusionment with the culture of TV production in the US. Their sharp and cleverly observed comedy about the erudite headmaster of an elite boarding school who is in love with a lesbian librarian is turned into a broad sitcom about a hockey coach and a sexy (and ultimately attainable) librarian. The final insult is that they are lumped with Matt LeBlanc as the lead, an actor who is about as far from 'Brand Erudite' as one could imagine.

Another reviewer has said that 'Episodes' is more clever than funny, and that is a fair description. The straightforwardly comedic elements tend to be a bit lame (eg. the security guard who consistently fails to recognise them when they try to get into their gated community). What is clever is the extent to which we are led to see that there is more to the difference between British and American television than just 'smart vs. dumb'. Gradually we come to understand that the product of a small industry with limited funds that prizes creativity and invention is always going to be different to that of a lucrative media-producing machine with a constant demand for material that can appeal to a wide audience. A particularly brilliant scene is when the star of the British version of 'Lyman's Boys' auditions for the US execs. The material that is funny when played with a British accent and manner comes across as merely mean-spirited when he tries an American accent. Much is lost in translation, and perhaps there is a reason why the US material is always 'dumbed down'.

A highlight of the show is Matt LeBlanc, who plays a charming, manipulative and amoral version of himself. Strangely we find that 'Joey' is the most consistently rational person involved in the show, though even he has his doubts about what he is doing. The other actors range from acceptable to irritating in their performances.

Perhaps the next season of 'Episodes' will find a more consistent tone and move away from cheap attempts to be funny towards its true spot as a sharp satire.",1344211200,,2298,4.797979797979798

4235314,5,B003ZSHLPG,"I am really tired of all of the shows which are doing the balancing act of being the combo comedy and drama.  Some of these are Big C, Nurse Jackie and Enlightened, which are always competing in the comedy category but are far from being laugh out loud funny.  I like these shows but they really do not satisfy my desire for straight comedy.  This show does.

The premise is that a married British couple who are comedy writers are plunked down into Hollywood to make their comedy writing work on an American tv show.  If you have ever watched British tv, which I have, the emphasis on quality is far more pronounced in Britain than it is in America.  Yes, we have our quality tv shows but we also have an incredible amount of outright drek.  Unfortunately, these two are hired by a the king of crude, awful tv shows.  The producer embodies everything that is awful about Hollywood and everyone who works for him is constantly trying to satisfy his capricious nature.  He has a female assistant who seems dumb at first but we come to discover she really understands what sells in her boss's world.

Our two writers play chiefly off Matt LeBlanc, who is the lead in this new show as a hockey coach. LeBlanc plays himself and he is hilarious doing so. The two writers are continually outraged by virtually everything he does yet there is something about him which draws one into his web. While one really would not want to know the producer, it would be hard to say the same about LeBlanc. Inevitably LeBlanc starts coming inbetween these two, something which seemed impossible at the start.

I am now enjoying watching season two of this show, which is every bit as funny.

4235315,4,B003ZSHLPG,"After winning a BAFTA for their acclaimed UK television series (""Lyman's Boys""), married couple Sean and Beverly Lincoln are approached by a crude American producer (Merc Lapidus) who wants them to adapt the show for the U.S.  Despite their distaste for Hollywood, the Lincolns hesitantly agree, assuming that they'll spend a few restful weeks in Los Angeles and make some easy money.  Unfortunately, once they hit American soil, everything begins to unravel.  Merc had never actually seen their show and immediately starts requesting drastic changes, including recasting the lead character with an American actor.  Enter Matt LeBlanc, who plays a more boorish version of himself.  He's desperate for a new hit show and signs on to play the lead - an erudite headmaster of a boy's school.  Before long, the show has been compromised and changed into a typical, empty-headed sitcom.  However, against their better judgment, the Lincolns start to get sucked into the Hollywood scene that they mock, especially once they see the amazing L.A. mansion that has been rented for them and then start to meet celebrities.

""Episodes"" is based on a terrific premise that allows for endless American and Brit comparisons as well as satire of television in general.  Merc, for example, loves putting on fake Brit accents and saying ridiculous things every time he sees the Lincolns; he also has a dark side, as seen in his hilariously shabby treatment of his blind wife.  The show is well-written, although it tends to be more clever than funny per se.  The acting is uniformly good and the characters have been flushed out fairly well, although some of the minor characters tend toward caricatures.  LeBlanc comes off particularly well as the good-hearted but constantly screwing up larger than life version of Joey, who soon wins over Sean (Stephen Mangan); he received an Emmy nomination for the role.  Beverly (Tamsin Greig), on the other hand, is too shrill in these early episodes to be likeable, and the actress sometimes relies on a variety of obnoxious ""I can't believe it"" faces.  Fortunately, the chemistry between Mangan and Greig is quite good (they acted together previously in a UK sitcom called ""Green Wing""); they really do seem like a married couple.

The show is a joint production between Showtime and the BBC.  Like many British shows, the season is short - just 7 episodes.  In these first few episodes, the show has not quite found its tone yet and needs some tweaking, such as dropping or flushing out some of the minor characters.  Nevertheless, despite some weaknesses it's still clever enough to rate 4 stars.",1339804800,2,2624,5.006912442396313

Yes, this is a great ensemble cast:

1.) Kudos to character actor John Pankow (as Merc the network executive) is a ""dark horse"".  His character is so truly distasteful that I want to strangle him every time he has a monologue!

2.) Matt LeBlanc, as Matt LeBlanc, alternates between being a poster boy for Hollywood excess and genuinely funny.  I like him better in this role than I did in ""Friends"".

4235321,5,B003ZSHLPG,"When this Showtime series was on cable I watched it three times and laughed like I was seeing it for the first time every time.  The cast of characters cannot be beat. I love them all.

Matt LeBlanc, of course, is the star of the show and plays an actor who is supposed to be playing himself.  He isn't ""Joey"" from ""Friends"" but because of his role on ""Friends"" we kind of know him... only now playing ""himself"" as his star-personna playing Matt LeBlanc, he's even rougher around the edges and hilariously conceited.

The plot centers around a married British couple played brilliantly by Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig who have written an award-winning smash hit comedy in England and how a devious and ruthless Hollywood producer played by John Pankow, (who only pretends to have  seen their show)invites them to Hollywood to recreate their show for American TV where they are lead to believe they will have full control. Of course they have no control and to make matters worse they are stuck with ""Joey."" As their lead.

So a comedy once revolving around a headmaster in an exclusive boys school is dumbed down to a hockey coach set in a regular high school.

The contrast of Hollywood and all that entails seen through the eyes of the British couple couldn't be more spot on. The husband is totally seduced by Hollywood, the fantastic houses, the fantastic weather, the fantastic breasts on everyone, while the wife is just seething with regret and remorse for having been duped by the producer and for having to be stuck with the likes of ""Joey.""

The fantastic writing coupled with the first class cast is just a joy to watch. The comedy builds and builds and is intelligently written and is fast paced. We begin at the end and have to ""back track"" to how it all began.

Matt LeBlanc snagged a Golden Globe for his role on the series which was a nod to his great work on ""Espisodes."" The show and the entire cast also deserved recognition.",1333065600,13,1947,4.604046242774566

Nowhere on the discs or the description here does it say they aren't US discs, but the show was done in association with BBC, and has a British rating on the package, so maybe these are actually UK-only discs.

Brilliantly written dialogues, and fabulous delivery by Matt Le Blanc and
absolutely fantastic Stephen Mangan, Tamsin Greig.
Matt is perfectionist as usual and his flawless performance is just smooth as silk.
I wish his character was more lovable rather then repulsive and plenty vulgar but
I guess this was to address certain demographics.
For the rest of us the perfectionistic performances of Tamsin Greig and Stephen Managan
full of natural and eloquent to the brim smart ass packed dialogues made
up for any other flaws that this show might have but not enough to
turn off once you got hooked on the witt of the Greig Managan couple.
It was rather hilarious  to see the efforts of imitating American environments
in many scenes that clearly and obviously must have been filmed elsewhere
.. maybe in UK? That in many cases failed in many ways as it is easy to
catch for the American viewer all the elements that are just not native
to the US.. just to give you couple examples - the square tiles in the
kitchen back splashes.. dead give away of European style, you won't see
in the US. Next thing.. the round doorknobs, yes, very much American
but the sheer use of them was faulty. While those doorknobs are staple
of many American low end homes, they are not much used in the office environment
especially sophisticated one like high end office buildings.
Yet you see them everywhere like a plague.
Oh the whole layout of the kitchens, most cases, dead give away that
it was not American, from the what, to where, and how..
including insanely high island at Joey's whife's house
that was so high that it was laughable.  Yet cutely amusing.

I just hope that we will see more of Stephen Mangan, Tamsin Greig
in the US in some more intellectual show written just for them.
They just ROCK! It does not really matter what they say,
the way they say it is just so fab that I could just watch them
talking about anything.

settings.",1518393600,,2027,4.622222222222222
