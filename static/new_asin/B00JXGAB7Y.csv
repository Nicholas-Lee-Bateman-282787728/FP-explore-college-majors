8654480,5,B00JXGAB7Y,"R2B (aka Black Eagle) is a taught, very tough, exciting and moving show that will keep you on the edge of your seat once the action starts and the world teeters on the edge of a possible nuclear confrontation when a rogue North Korean general stages a coup d' etat to overthrow the existing N. Korean government.  He also begins fueling the nuclear ICBM missiles that are under his command.

But when the coup starts, a defector tries to fly his jet to S. Korea to warn them.  The rogue general sends a ruthless and expert pilot after the defector to shoot him down before he can warn the south of what's happening.  The brutal N. Korean fighter pilot catches up with the defector and the escorting S. Korean jets and shoots the defector down.  He then proceeds to launch a brutal and ruthless attack on a major S. Korean city, shooting down two of the S. Korean fighter jets in the process.  The aerial combat sequences over the city are nothing less than breathtaking as the defending S. Korean jets try draw the enemy jet away from the city so they can engage him.

You'll want to yell and scream as the rouge fighter jet shoots down two of the defense fighter jets as the other S. Korean jets are helpless to respond due to the very strict orders that forbids them from engaging the enemy jet while it is over heavily populated civilian areas.  At best they can only use their guns against him in a very limited way as using missiles over the city is strictly forbidden.  The enemy finally clears the city but manages to cross the DMZ back into N. Korea before the remaining defense jets can engage.  You'll rage right along with their pilots as command forbids them to cross over into N. Korea in pursuit of the enemy pilot, even though he shot down two of their planes and killed their comrades, and orders them to return to base (R2B).

There is a bitter argument between the US and the S. Korean governments over how to respond to the situation as the US wants to launch immediate attacks since they know that the N. Korean nuclear ICBMs are targeted on the US and will soon be ready to launch.  The S. Koreans finally get the US to hold off for a time while they launch a desperate operation to rescue one of the S. Korean pilots who was shot down and landed on the N. Korean side, at the same time that another part of the operation targets the rogue general's HQ and ICBM site in order to neutralize it with a surgical strike.

The aerial combat sequences are absolutely breathtaking and definitely give the ones from Top Gun, as good as they were, a real run for the money.

There is excellent character development of the various pilots, mechanics and command staff of the S. Korea fighter squadron as we get to know them individually and get glimpses into their personal lives, their hopes, dreams, fears and loves.

This is one hell of a terrific movie that jet fighter fans will enjoy and a definite ""must"" see movie.  The Blu Ray release quality is superb at 1080p and better than the Black Eagle release from 2012. The audio is also much better having been upgraded to DTS-HD 5.1.

This movie is in Korean with English subtitles, by the way.  The Blu",1423526400,,3168,4.442141623488774
