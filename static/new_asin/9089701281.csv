The lagoon dvd in this set was ok but slow and the cricket sound was so loud as to be distracting and quite annoying after awhile! would not reccommend this set.",1319155200,,290,4.017241379310345

Some people look at life differently with anger. I don't because I know this world is nice. Looking at the DVDs lets me know that no matter what GOD created something special for us and its captured here.",1310256000,,337,4.28125
