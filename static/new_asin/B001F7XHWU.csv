3566248,4,B001F7XHWU,This movie had alot of influence on me when I was a kid learning to play basketball. If you love great sports movies. You must watch The Pistol.,1240185600,,144,4.178571428571429
3566249,5,B001F7XHWU,"I not only watched him in college, but followed his greatness into the pros and thought ""What if"" he were able to play with the rules of today ?

He was SO past his prime when he finally got to a good team that many did not get to know how unbelievable his talent was...

And a truly ""Good Guy"" that inspired a lot of people.

That in inself is enough for me to order this movie even though I've seen it 5 times already ! I want my kids and grandkids to appreciate this....

And wonder what ever happened to Boots Garland... ran track with him as coach in High School.... Fun loving GOOD teacher as well...",1239753600,2,606,4.110169491525424
3566250,4,B001F7XHWU,This Movie is a great movie for children and adults both.  This movie could easily spark a love for the game of basketball in a child's heart.  Classic Movie and a very good story.,1233100800,2,180,4.264705882352941
3566251,5,B001F7XHWU,"""The Pistol: The Birth of a Legend"" (1990) is a very inspirational film. When I was a child, my parents purchased the film on VHS. I thought the film was moderately interesting yet nothing spectacular.

Now that I am an adult, I see the film differently. Certainly, there are many scenes were people simply talk with one another - the amount of basketball played might take up 20 minutes of the film. However, the theme of the film is about following your dreams (and yes, certainly there are many other films with this same theme). Yet, ""The Pistol"" is persuasive to me because Pete Maravich actually WAS able to fulfill his dream ""of becoming the greatest college basketball player ever."" It is not a fictional story created to make people feel good about themselves. Maravich is still the all-time leading NCAA Division I scorer with 3,667 points scored and an average of 44.2 points per game. (Note: Maravich accomplished this without the benefit of a three-point line and despite the fact that NCAA rules prohibited him from playing on the varsity team as a freshman.)

But enough with the statistics - the point is that many people did not believe that someone as small in stature as Pete Maravich was in junior high (as least as was portrayed in the film) could become a great basketball player. Yet, as the film shows in many scenes, Pete desired to fulfill his dream - it became his life. Pete's father (a college basketball coach) inspired and encouraged him, yet it was Pete  who gave his countless hours to perfect his skills.

In short, ""The Pistol"" is the type of film I want to give to skeptics who believe that ""ability"" alone is what determines how successful a person can become in any area of life. I recommend the film.",1230940800,23,1739,4.6547231270358305
3566252,5,B001F7XHWU,"We bought for our 9 year old grandson, along with the ""Homework DVD's, who wants to follow in his favorite uncle's (our son) footsteps in basketball. We bought the VHS versions for our son years ago, as ""PIstol Pete"" was very admired by our son, who wanted to be able to do the things ""Pistol Pete"" did, and he did!!! Leading point guard for our middle and high school of all time, and still is. He graduated from high school in 2001. He still has the VHS's, but our grandson doesn't have a VHS player.",1392508800,,502,4.294736842105263
3566253,5,B001F7XHWU,"I saw this movie years ago and was hoping this would be the same.  It was and my grandchildren will enjoy it as much as my children did.  Great motivational movie!  My kids are basketball players, but you don't have to be to enjoy this movie.  I think anyone will be able to associate with the movie and understand that it is ok to be different.",1388707200,,345,4.181818181818182
3566254,5,B001F7XHWU,"Great movie...Good quality
My kids love it and we watch it as a family from time to time.
I would buy it again.",1360108800,,111,3.869565217391304
3566255,5,B001F7XHWU,Needed to have a copy of this because my husband played one of the coach's in this movie. Plus it was filmed here in our home city!,1356220800,,131,3.888888888888889
3566256,5,B001F7XHWU,"This movie is an example of how hard work, dedication and perseverance can pay off in big ways.  Along Pete's journey in life, there were plenty of people who said he couldn't play against real competition. He loved basketball and with the strong support and coaching of his dad, he became equipped to perform what was considered at the time to be miraculous.  He is still considered one of the best of the best.  There are so many players in the hall of fame who actually had to dribble correctly and not carry or palm the ball in doing so.  The rules or lack of them in the modern game leaves me wanting something more when I see a game nowadays.  I long for the days when people who had honed their skills really put on a show.  That's what Pistol Pete did every time he laced his sneakers.  This movie is an excellent account of his early life, but I wish it had been a little longer so it could show more of his accomplishments as an adult.  He was one a kind.  If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it with two thumbs up.",1344988800,,1033,4.2030456852791875
3566257,4,B001F7XHWU,"This Pistol Pete Maravich video deserves 5 stars for what and how it was presented.  But I gave it 4 stars BECAUSE OF WHAT IT LACKED. The video left we searching the web to find out how he progressed from age 8 to his death in January 1998. This movie could use a sequel telling what he meant by his ""father dyeing at to early an age"". How did he rise to stardom over coming his 5' 2"" (?) height when he started high school and quickly go to first string? Did his dad coaching for LSU get him the scholarship his mother wanted for him? What if his dad was not famous, would he have ever gotten to play first string and develop the stills towards greatness? What about his transition to pro ball. The message seems to tell young viewer you can only make it ""IF YOU HAVE A FAMOUS DAD or sponsor"" and dedicate all of your energies to the detriment of all other things, and must have the undying motivation to win forsaking all NORMAL pressures, needs. and desires. That's likely true but what about those that cannot afford that dedication due to the lack of support and financial environment and a measure of friend, luck, and the contacts for get to play first string. Was his father an abusive pusher and at what cost? The photo at the end of the video showed an older man, very tall, talking to his son, was that Pistol Pete, if so it left we wondering? What was the injection of having a black friend and playing one game(?) with a all black High School have to do with the story? Sorry I missed it, was it only to show he was not a bigot in 1959 and add to his nice guy image? Did he marry his cheerleader girlfriend? I may have missed the answers since I did not purchase the inspirational version. I MUST ADD THAT THE SKILLS DEMONSTRATED BY THE YOUNG ACTOR WERE AMAZING, AND IF YOU COACH BASKETBALL CUT OUT THOSE SECIONS AND DRILL YOUR PLAYERS TO LEARN THOSE SKILLS.",1318636800,,1871,4.270422535211267
3566258,5,B001F7XHWU,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was about 9 or 10 years old.  It's one of the main reasons I wanted to be a point guard (well that and the fact that I'm only 5'3"" lol).  I remembered really enjoying this movie and it just made me feel good about basketball.  I'm 25 now and I still play basketball for recreation and to this day I still love this movie.  Ranks among the top 10 of my favorite basketball movies!",1311638400,,434,4.070588235294117
3566259,5,B001F7XHWU,"The Pistol is a great movie about Pete Maravich and his childhood.  I highly recommend this movie for the young ambitious ones in your life.  It is a story of overcoming peer pressure and the threats of those who seem to be stronger.
Give your child the gift of a great learning experience...give them a copy of ""The Pistol""!",1282435200,,325,4.491525423728813
3566260,5,B001F7XHWU,"All I need to say is that you can pass this movie from generation to generation and it will always be loved. A boy, his father, hard work paying off. What's best???? It's a true story. A must view for any family!",1280534400,,212,4.071428571428571
3566261,2,B001F7XHWU,"This movie is about the stint in the life of Pistol Pete Maravich in which he is living in Clemson and wants to make it to the basketball team. It does not tell us much about when he played for his dad in LSU or about his jump to the CBA. It is more directed to kids in order for coaches and parents to present Maravich's figure and as a motivational strategy for those kids who need to know that without passion and practice, it is unlikely to succeed.",1272067200,,453,4.101123595505618
3566262,5,B001F7XHWU,"An awsesome DVD & the Amazing talent that the young actor Adam Guier who depicted Pete Maravich.
This is a inspirational story to any young person who wants to aspire to better things, it certainly does it for me as coming from a Basketball background myself, however when I was playing my Hero's in the game were Bill Russell, Jerry West, & Dr ""J"" & the likes from that era.
It has taken me years to find this flim after 1st seeing this many a year ago.
Once again a must watch & highly Reccommended",1267660800,,500,4.273684210526316
3566263,5,B001F7XHWU,Can't wait to show this movie to my kids one day. Delivery was on time and the DVD is in great shape.,1265328000,,101,3.6363636363636362
3566264,5,B001F7XHWU,"Pete Maravich is the greatest scorer in the history of NCAA basketball. Think about it. This is a record that has stood for 40 years AND he did it before the three point rule (he was a guard with many of his shots outside today's three point boundary) AND freshman were not eligible when he played so he did it in three years. He averaged 44 points (charts show it would have been an incredible 57 with the three point rule) per game for three seasons. He also went on to become one of the all time great NBA players and was the youngest ever selected for the Hall of Fame. He was also a pioneer of the free wheeling style of basketball that dominates today. Behind the back passes and between the legs dribbling were unheard of in the white dominated basketball culture. Much more common in the segregated black teams and leagues, it was considered show-boating and hot-dogging in the white culture at that time. But Pete had a Dad, Press Maravich (a great player & coach in his own right), who was also a visionary and saw this as the future of basketball. This film is the story of how a father passed on his dream and vision to his talented and determined son at an early age. The film primarily covers Pete's eighth grade basketball, a coming of age experience, for this young man, both socially and athletically. Too good for his age and not politically correct to beat out the coach's son, he sits on the bench for a good part of the season until an injury puts him in the starting lineup. Basketball would never be the same again. While not a big budget film, nevertheless, it is a very satisfying story of this incredible athlete in this particular stage of his career. Adam Guier, who plays the eighth grade Pete, is no slouch as a basketball talent and makes the basketball scenes very real. Get the family or your team together for a fun and inspiring experience.",1262304000,,1875,4.453488372093023
3566265,5,B001F7XHWU,"This movie is essentially a recording of what's great about America and the American Dream. You will not find a more representative example of passion and commitment. I was stunned to learn the story of the beginning of the legend created by Pistol Pete. I left yearning to know more, and to see what happened in the years following those the movie covered. Don't purchase this movie if you seek simply entertainment. Buy this movie to learn about the art of the possible.",1260230400,7,472,4.698795180722891

3566269,5,B001F7XHWU,"The movie of Pete Maravich is an outstanding source of encouragement for Parents to use as a valuable teaching tool for their junior high boys and girls.  As an eighth grader, Pete was a lot smaller than his team mates, but his skill and ""can do"" attitude overcame all of that to send him to the top of the game.  These principles taught by this father are true today...no matter what your children choose for their life journey.  I bought it for my grand son and great grandsons, but as a teen of the ""50's, I found it entertaining also!",1254268800,,538,4.36
3566270,1,B001F7XHWU,"The story line for ""The Pistol"" was great if the product was not a bootleg copy. I was extremely disappointed over the quality of the product, but if copy is purchased in excellent condition to be heard clearly, I recommend this film for any youth that is trying to accomplish a goal in life.",1250812800,,292,4.425925925925926
3566271,5,B001F7XHWU,"This is a story about a very ambitious and confident kid's drive to succeed--in an environment where failure is almost a guarantee. The kid, Pete Maravich, is in 8th grade, and he wants to start on the varsity team! The story is well done and quite entertaining, and I've enjoyed this film since I was a kid.

This movie would definitely fall into the ""cheesy sports movie"" class except for one thing--it's a true story! Of course, One must always take a true story from Hollywood with a grain of salt, but I think it can be mostly trusted. I, for one, like ""cheesy"" when it happens to be true. (Disney's ""The Rookie"" comes to mind.)

The biggest flaw with the movie is the acting. The movie at times appears to be a very low budget film. In fact, I'm sure it was a low budget film. But here's the thing, it's a sports story about one of the all-time basketball legends, and if you let the story grab you, you can overlook the acting. I know some people simple cannot stomach a movie that looks anything less than a blockbuster. If that's you, stay away from this. But if you can overlook flaws in favor of a great story (and you like good sports films) check this out!",1247529600,6,1169,4.333333333333333
