5312257,5,B009B1EP0A,"This was hilarious, spiritual, and relatable, with a lot of lovely actresses AND HANDSOME Lamman Rucker. Man is FOINE! Anyway, wonderful movie and nice adaptation of Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"".",1387929600,,192,5.655172413793103
5312258,3,B009B1EP0A,"I wouldn't call this a gospel movie or play, however it was a nice feature starring 3 of my favorite (all beautiful and typically underrated african american) actresses. I found myself rooting for Terri J. Vaughn's character, while knowing women like Vanessa  William's and Rachel True's characters. There were flaws in the plot, but overall it was an enjoyable feature and each of the three women were recognizable characters. It is a shame that beautiful and talented women like these are not seen more often on tv and the big screen. The guys in the movie also did a good job. Tommy Ford (the pope of comedy - dawg) was good, and reminded me of people I knew, who waste their youth and then 20 years later try to reclaim it. Lamman Rucker,Vashawn Mitchell, and Dante Wyatt were all good.",1386288000,,790,4.642857142857143
5312259,1,B009B1EP0A,Acting was ok but was not the type of movie for me. Waste of time and money if you buy this movie.,1371513600,,98,3.5
5312260,3,B009B1EP0A,i thought this was a movie i don't like theatre on dvds i bought 3 more dvds from amazon with theatre and don't like any of them,1365033600,,128,3.7777777777777777
5312261,4,B009B1EP0A,"I first saw the ad for this on a Redbox, but couldn't rent it because it wasn't anywhere in the area. I kept watching the trailer for this over and over until finally I said ""I'm going to buy it!"" The women in this are sassy, sensitive, and surprising. I'll admit that having most of the action on stage is an adjustment. For a play, though, it had an amazing set design. But the dialogue has got me hooked. I love the distinction between these three women, not just in their dialogue but in their view of the world. I would have liked it more if the ending hadn't been so abrupt, but it wasn't so bad.",1361577600,3,602,4.153846153846154
5312262,2,B009B1EP0A,"I rented this from Redbox..Didnt know it was a 'play' Soooo, that was strike one..had i known, i wouldnt have rented it. There were a BUNCH of UBER CORNY lines. I gave two stars because the person who convince real (even b list) celebrities to be in this, deserves a star just for that!! SO all in all, if your bored, it may hold your attention.. it was an OK effort.... took like 3 tries for me to finish.",1360972800,,406,4.151898734177215
5312263,1,B009B1EP0A,Bought this movie for $10 dollars at Walmart and it was not good or touching to me. It has a message but the play fell short all the way. I thought it will be descent because I liked the girls in it but its not worth even paying a $1 and shipping and handeling for it. It would have zero stars from me but I had to rate 1 star. urrrrrr. waste of my money when I could of got something useful or another good movie. i wouldnt even wanna give it away for free.,1356998400,,458,3.831578947368421
5312264,2,B009B1EP0A,The movie did not have a good story line and Vashawn Mitchell should stick to singing only.  The story was not well put together and the actors seem to be over acting. The one song that Vashawn Mitchell sang didn't fit the situation at all.,1356652800,,240,4.333333333333333
5312265,3,B009B1EP0A,"This is a made for TV gospel play complete with canned laughter, corny lines, and some questionable acting. Three women have opened a dessert catering store called ""Sugar Mommas."" The women are Shelia (Terri J. Vaughn), a 41 year old widow who wants to have a baby, but doesn't have a boyfriend. She wants to do this in vitro to the dismay of her sister/partner Lynn (Vanessa Williams). Lynn is 45 but doesn't look a day over 30. She is dating a 22 year old boy named Hank Young who sings for a band. She has talked him into leaving school to pursue his dream of being a singer.

Tommi (Rachel True) is the third partner of the store. She is married to Derrek, a man who seriously needs acting lessons. When Jason (Lamman Rucker), a health food inspector shuts the store door, things become unglued as the health food inspector is also Hank's father who not only disapproves of the sugar momma relationship, but wants his son to attend college.

Relationships become unusually strained. Derrek (VaShawn Mitchell) decides he can't handle his wife working at a bakery at night and wants a divorce as he behaves badly. He then goes into a gospel spiritual asking for divine guidance as if he is the victim.

The humor is not very funny. When Jason asks, ""How old is Lynn anyway?"" Shelia's response is ""On paper or in her head?"" Cue laughter. The film has religious themes and mixes philosophy with religion. Fate is oversimplified as a ""God Chart."" Supposedly the Almighty keeps paper charts on everyone's life. Although the religious themes are kept light, it is clearly part of the background.

There is only one musical number in this film. This is a series which appears on GMC on Saturdays at 7 and 9 according to the promo. Clips can be found on the web.

Parental Guide: Family approved by the Dove Foundation for ages 12 and older. Vanessa William provides some legs/cleavage eye candy.",1356134400,4,1891,4.649700598802395

8539109,1,B009B1EP0A,"It starts off with a 45-year-old woman bragging about her 22-year-old boyfriend and it's all downhill from there.  I had to fast forward, it was too dumb.
When a person is dating someone young enough to be their son; that is pretty unwholesome.  Bad writing, acting, directing.",1490572800,,277,4.872340425531915
