7858829,3,6304017650,"The Matt Helm Spy Film Series was never a serious competitor to The James Bond Films, but they were entries into the faltering end of Spy Film Craze which vaporized in the Seventies (But now seems to be making a comeback.) Dean Martin played Matt Helm Agent for ICE (Intelligence Counter Espionage) or rather Dean played Dino playing at being a secret agent. Never does  a chance to booze it up, make a play for any available female, or have a smoke go untaken. It's typical 60's and 70's kitschy fare with girls in go-go boots, psychedelic dresses and big hair. When the girls are wearing anything at all. While the Helm movies would get a low-end PG rating today, they we're rated M for Mature when they debuted, an equivilent for R without the nudity, or foul language that you see in today's R rated releases. I don't think Helm utters anything stronger than ""hell"".  The best of the four flicks was ""Murderer's Row"" where Helm has to stop a crazed Karl Malden as millionaire Julian Wall from scorching Washington DC with something called a ""Helios Beam"". It's all great fun, as Dino quips, boozes and loves his way from one end of the flick to the other with the casual aplomb of someone who is strolling back to the bar for another round. The gadgets in this film are chic, the villian's henchman ""IronHead"" is hulking, has a metal cranium and is as unstoppable as Oddjob or Jaws in the Bond flicks, and there's a chase involving hovercraft . If 60's spy flicks are your cup of tea then Matt Helm is your sugar.",1099353600,4,1517,4.492753623188406
7858830,3,6304017650,"Dean Martin as super cool, super lover, super boozer, super slick, super spy Matt Helm, aka Eric, aka James A. Peters, aka Lash Petrone, Beverly Adams as his secretary Lovey Kravezit, Karl Malden as arch villain and arch enemy of Matt, Julian Wall, Camilla Sparv as his assistant Coco Duquette, Tom Reese as his, snicker, hard-headed muscleman 'Ironhead', Corinne Cole as 'Miss January', James Gregory (I) as Matt's boss MacDonald and director of I.C.E. (Intelligence Counter Espionage), Ann-Margret as Suzie Solaris and Richard Eastham as her poppa and inventor of the super gizmo, Dr. Norman Solaris, in a fun little film that to watch you must first park your brain, your cynicism and put a smile on your face and prepare to snicker endlessly throughout! A delicious little spoof of the James Bond genre has Martin doing what he and the rest of the 'Rat Pack' did so well, drinking and wooing the ladies despite those pesky villains trying to take his mind off his favorite hobbies. This rates a solid 2.5 stars out of 4.",1020211200,5,1024,4.823863636363637
