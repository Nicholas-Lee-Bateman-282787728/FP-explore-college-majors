A little disappointed it does not include other broadcast pieces, such as pregame or One Shining Moment.  But a good DVD to own for fans of the teams participating.",1389744000,,307,4.446428571428571

8059065,5,B0009CTUI2,"This DVD is perfect for fans of college basketball. It is different than the championship DVDs of Syracuse and Connecticut.

This DVD contains:

- A 50-minute feature on the NCAA Tournament

- The entire National Semifinal game between Louisville and Illinois

- The entire National Semifinal game between Michigan State and North Carolina

- The entire National Championship Game

My favorite part of this DVD is the fact that there are three full games to watch. All three games are done without commercial interruption and done by the CBS crew. The 50-minute feature is cool because it has in-depth highlights from some of the biggest games in the first 4 rounds.

If you like Sports DVDs that have full broadcasts of games, than this is for you",1138492800,9,748,4.84251968503937
