5177527,5,B008P76UP4,"This is a one hour 53 minute peek into the hearts and minds of the students and faculty of the St Thomas Boys Choir of Leipzig. It fills my heart with joy.

Perhaps the best way I can tell you about it is to just repeat some notes I made to myself. I made these notes after watching it several times, English subtitles ON (I don't speak German). They include the time reference and some of the boys' names. Herr Biller is the head of the choir.

Here they are.

About 90 boys ranging from 9 to 18 have been accepted into the choir, which includes a boarding house (the Alumnat) and one of the best academic schools in Germany (St Thomas, a gymnasium school). Each was only 9 when he entered, and each will spend 10 years there, receiving a superb musical education and be qualified for any college when he graduates.

Older boys, ""prefects"", live with, help and supervise younger boys. An ""ultimus"" is the name given to a close relationship between an older and younger boy, more than best friends, perhaps closer than brothers. At 6:14, observe the younger boy, still wearing his Keil blouse, embrace his older pal, who has just graduated and will soon be gone. The tears are real.

Consider 14:30: Newcomer Cornelius tells of his homesickness, having wept twice yesterday, but later tells about his older roommate who talked to him that night about life in the Thomanerchor, easing his pain and finally letting him get to sleep. That was a precious act, and Cornelius will always remember it. Note the expressions on the face of Max, Cornelius' tiny companion, who is clearly concentrating on every word said, and reflecting his own serious engagement with the trials his friend is enduring. I think his face defines empathy.

12:37, watch the spontaneous smile and humor of Herr Biller as little Max hits high C. ""You can't even hear this high pitch!""

The DVD producers are careful to acknowledge that the boys' lives are not all roses--

  --At 14:15, Ansgar tells it like it is: ""We are perfectly normal boys, with all kinds of problems.""

  --At 15:05, the initiation rite (a kind of baptism?) is fun and understandable, but look at the faces of the 9 year old initiates when Herr Biller tells them they must wear the letters ""TC"" inked on their cheeks until they graduate. Their smiles are frozen and faked -- they don't know if he's kidding or not! (He is.)

  --See the boys' total boredom with the sermon  at 23:48

  --33:05  Bedtime pillow fight. The Prefect comes in and breaks it up. One boy thinks the prefect has it in for him, and as the prefect leaves, the boy says ""It's just because I grinned. S***!""

  (Yes, they're certainly normal boys.)

All that is in the first 35 minutes, and it only gets better.

1:19:00 The nighttime Christmas caroling in the snowy streets brings tears to my eyes; it is an exchange of gifts of the heart between the Thomassers and their community, humanity at its finest. The caroling at last finished, the chilled kids rush to return to the warmth of their Alumnat, running across the iconic, softly-lit, snow-covered wooden  bridge in Johannapark, bursting with joy and enthusiasm. For me, this is perhaps the climax of this wonderful story. (Kudos to the producers and photographers; this bridge scene couldn't have been better.)

Technically, the DVD is flawless. The images are pristine and composed with great sensitivity. When the choir sings in concert, the performances are superb: the audio quality has to be heard to be believed.

Paul Smaczny and Gunter Atteln have produced a DVD worthy of the Thomanerchor.
Both the DVD and the choir are masterworks.

5177530,5,B008P76UP4,"This is simply one of the best musical documentaries I've seen. Expecting this to be a history on the Thomanerchor (St. Thomas Boys Choir), celebrating its 800th birthday this year, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is more about the 'day in the life of' both chorister and director of this famed choir. Actually, it's ""A Year in the Life of the St. Thomas Boys Choir, Leipzig.""

We follow several age groups of boys (and young men), from the newly selected choristers (aged 9) to veteran members (aged 18 to 19) who serve as mentors to the younger members, helping the younger choristers in their daily lives- with their normal, everyday struggles, the desire and requirements to be serious musicians, and their extracurricular activities, such as card playing, videos games and soccer. There is the added pressure of being members of one of the oldest musical legacies in the history of classical music.

Georg Christoph Biller, the choir's current cantor (since 1992) has some very large shoes to fill. This was none other than Johann Sebastian Bach's position with the same choir beginning in 1723 and ending with his death in 1750. (It might be worth noting that Bach's grave is located inside St. Thomas' Church. To this day, choir members show reverence by placing flowers at his grave. Luckily this is shown several times in this excellent documentary). We see Biller takes his job as cantor with utmost seriousness. He has an admiration for his young charges, though he keeps his distance, always being 'the tamer' as he puts it; you get the sense that he'd like to be their friend and in some ways he is, if at a distance.

The documentary presents what I believe is a non-biased look at the choir. While Cantor Biller stresses to the youngsters that Bach's music is religious and the true meaning goes deeper than just the notes and words on the page, he's also faced with the reality that given today's society, there is actually a large percentage of non-religious boys that make up the choir, even some who are atheists. But you find too, that some older boys, who were less into religion going into the choir, later find themselves being baptized and confirmed.

We see that these are normal boys like anyone else, and while we expect to see most of them interested in classical music, some are clearly more interested in heavy metal music, or girls. Soccer plays an important part in the lives of the boys too, and we're treated to a match between the Thomanerchor and another boy choir, the Dresdner Kreuzchor.

As for school life, the boys attend St. Thomas School, Leipzig, also established in 1212. Classes are co-ed and the choristers are often the more successful students at the school. Many of the older members have girl friends who openly praise the boys for being so much more smarter than the other boys in class. I should point out too that the choir has a unique system of mentorship, where the young choir member has an older member assigned to him. This works out great in both the socialization of the younger members (most who are away from home the first time in their lives) and the musical upbringing, if you will, of the younger charge.

The musical performances presented in the documentary are stunning. We get a chance to see Herr Biller give the boys a pep talk right before a performance of Bach's B Minor Mass. Biller stresses that their task is special, ""You are part of something great, so take part with greatness."" The payoff is seeing (hearing) the results.

As for technical details about the documentary, the original language is German and there are excellent subtitles in English. The aspect ratio is 16:9 - 1.85:1",1349308800,17,3678,4.755485893416928

8529412,5,B008P76UP4,"This DVD is showing a year in the life of members of the St. Thomas Boys Choir of Leipzig as they live and study at school, in rehearsals and their performances at home and on tour.  Teachers, parents, the choir Director and the boys all are interviewed as they go about their year as Thomaners.  This is an interesting look at the lives of these boys and young men as they learn their music and perform.  I would hope to see more about this Choir in the future.",1472947200,,462,4.2272727272727275

8529419,5,B008P76UP4,"For anyone interested in the wonderful Thomanerchor of Leipzig, this 800th Anniversary 2012 movie is a must.  Johann Sebastian Bach was their Thomaskantor 1723-1750.  Today Georg Christoph Biller, a former Thomaner himself, is Bach's 16th successor, holding that prestigious position since 1990.  Bach is the backbone of their repertoire today. Of Thomanerchor, Mozart, a Catholic, said in 1789: ""There is none like it in Berlin, Vienna, or Prague!"".  The English subtitles are very helpful. There are two bonus tracks from St. Matthew Passion.  The Blu-ray is a bit pricey, but maybe some of the proceeds go to Thomaskirche.  I got their Bachfest 2000 B-Minor Mass DVD for $5 awhile back, so the two average out OK!",1378512000,,716,5.129310344827586
