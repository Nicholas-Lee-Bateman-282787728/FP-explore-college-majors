6451780,2,B00KVVP4EA,"I LOVE David Garrett, I really do. Saw him in concert last year and enjoyed the heck out of it. He's a fantastic musician and a nice piece of eye candy to boot. However, this movie was AWFUL. I'd heard his acting was poor, but was unprepared for how poor it was. And the story didn't really make any sense and just sort of drifted away. Next time I want to see David Garrett on screen, I'll watch a video of him in concert",1424390400,8,422,4.035714285714286
6451781,5,B00KVVP4EA,"David Garrett is an artist that everyone should listen to, go see, or do whatever it takes to experience him.  I finally, after looking for it for 2 years, found this available in a format that I could use in the U.S.  He brings light and reverence to everything he touches, and this movie is no different.  He is one of the foremost artists of his generation, able to live, seemingly, in every single genre and dominate it, from classical music to rock.  His concerts are transcendent.  Get this, if you can.",1424044800,13,509,4.489130434782608

6451784,4,B00KVVP4EA,"Interesting take on a classical genius.  Script is the weakest part of the film unfortunately, but I suppose expressing the depth of one's intensely musical soul is not about this rather impressionistic pop culture movie. The part where the manager keeping the musician/artist drugged and confused in order to control him... What Rock Scully did to Garcia wasn't so original after all?
Garett's skillful violin performance is exceptional and beautiful, and his arrangements on some of the Classical pieces are highly entertaining.  I really loved the way he played pizzicato when he accompanied Charlotte's voice on his aria.  All in all, this is a fairly entertaining movie because of the magnificent music and wonderful staging.",1422576000,8,730,5.3304347826086955
6451785,5,B00KVVP4EA,"Overall a very well made film - beautiful costuming and set design! Exquisite violin playing! Can only be faulted on one aspect - Paganini was portrayed as a modern day rock God. Still, a must see for all David Garrett fans!!!",1416700800,4,226,4.536585365853658

6451787,5,B00KVVP4EA,"Like music, films are driven by emotions.

Fast-paced plot, richly atmospheric soundtrack, and star violinist David Garrett's sensational violin playing and beautifully acted Paganini make this film unmissible.

Plot summary by soundtrack:
1. Flying arpeggios and plunging scales ('Caprice No. 5') open the film. Teen Paganini plays his own composition, and is bow-whipped on head by his tyrannical father for playing violin in personal style.

2. Young Paganini plays fast ricochet passages from 'Caprice No. 5', as filler between opera entertainment on stage. Audience ignores him and keeps laughing.

3. Paganini plays 'Farmyard Caprice', imitating donkey's braying (plus passages from 'Caprice No. 19').

4. 'Caprice No. 9' (nicknamed ""The Hunt"") enters as camera zooms to Urbani, Paganini's future manager (""Manager"") among the audience. Happy to finally get the audience's attention, Paganini exits stage.

5. Triumphant 'Caprice No. 14' introduces impresario Watson (conductor and concert organizer, ""Impresario""), who invites Paganini to perform in London. Creditors seize expensive furniture to offset debts arising from Paganini's no-show, but let Impresario keep his piano.

6. Impresario evokes INTENSE longing (for Paganini) on the piano, playing beautiful 'Scarlatti Sonata in F minor, k466'.

7. Impassioned, sweeping 'Rachmaninoff: Paganini Variations' piano concerto enters to accompany scenes cross cut between (1) Impresario and mistress kiss and make up despite money worries, and (2) Manager et al. drag drug-sedated Paganini into a carriage.

8. Hypocrite protesters outside hotel force Paganini and Manager to move into Impresario's house ('Langham Waits').

9. Paganini is delighted to see innocent-looking Charlotte, Impresario's daughter who pretends to be the chambermaid. 'Caprice 13' (nicknamed ""The Devil's Laughter"") enters for comic effect.

10. During rehearsal, Paganini ""borrows"" concertmaster's precious Guarneri, tries it with 'multiple-octave scales', likes the sound, and walks away with the violin.

11. Paganini wows crowds in a pub playing 'Carnival Of Venice' and, after breaking 3 upper strings, a dashing 'cadenza on G-string'.

12. Suspense music 'Langham Waits' enters the darkening night. In a carriage leaving the pub, female journalist licks Paganini's long fingers before an interview; Paganini reaches over with long passionate kisses. An over-the-top feature story on Paganini's ""impromptu concert"" is front page news the next day.

13. Paganini composes 'Io Ti Penso Amore' to seduce Charlotte, who falls in love discovering she CAN sing high notes; raw emotions flash through Paganini's expressive brown eyes as he plucks violin pizzicato accompaniment.

14. Charlotte asks Paganini 'Who Is the Real You'. The romantic build-up intensifies. Paganini gets out of the house to practice 'Caprice No. 19' ('Farmyard Caprice' earlier, without donkey's braying) on violin.

15. London debut. Paganini enters unexpectedly from the back of the auditorium performing 'Caprice No. 24', eyeing Charlotte in stage wing, gauging her reaction. Manager acts as giant shadow puppet to enhance dramatic impact. Overexcited fans faint.

16. Paganini's virtuosic improvisations on 'God Save the King', with double harmonics, percussive pizzicato, double trills, Celtic lilt, extreme register leaps, etc. Wild cheers erupt.

17. Paganini kisses Charlotte in the wing, so she agrees to sing 'Io Ti Penso Amore'. From their first double notes the violin and the vocal line fly in beautiful harmony. Paganini's dark smoldering eyes are breathtaking.

18. Paganini performs bright ringing 'La Campanella', another encore.

19. Foreboding, dramatic 'Erlk&ouml;nig' enters, foreshadowing Manager's success in creating mistrust and nipping the budding romance to repossess (and monetize) Paganini.

20. Heart-rending 'Caprice No. 4' enters; forcefully separated Paganini and Charlotte leave jail and go separate ways.

21. Never wasting a good crisis, Impresario sends Charlotte off to USA for a promising soloist career (beautiful and heartbreaking piano version of 'Caprice No. 4').

22. Paganini performs the middle section of 'La Campanella' with much love and tenderness at his Casino Paganini concert hall, hoping his letter would persuade Charlotte to join him for a concert tour in Paris. To no avail.

23. Heartbroken Paganini 'Returns To Italy' (poignant 'Sonata No. 12 in E minor, Opus 3'), channeling all emotions into writing down all solo parts in his concertos to communicate and provoke strong feelings forever.

24. Alone in wheelchair, love-ravaged Paganini cradles his loyal violin plucking 'Io Ti Penso Amore', as memories of the lovely Charlotte and her pure voice fill Paganini's every thought till his last moments.

Garrett keeps it natural in front of the camera throughout (with minute detail, e.g. ""beyond broken hearted"" Paganini nearly stumbled on the steps upon returning to Italy), and the film script is well-researched (e.g. Paganini's ""secret red book"", musicians attend concert busy writing down Paganini's music). The soundtrack is instant classic!",1409788800,24,5112,5.773635153129161
6451788,5,B00KVVP4EA,"It made me curious to know the real Paganini's life, which I researched before watching the movie in order to be able to understand the movie (since I don't understand German).

I would recommend it for anyone, but especially those with an interest in history or who enjoy listening to Paganini's music.",1407628800,21,396,4.838235294117647

The music and his playing was the pure essence of David. He portrayed his part very well. Anyone, who criticizes his acting is a fool and missed the theme entirely. My favorite part that brought tears to my eyes was the debute with Charolette. Bravo, Maestro!!",1502582400,,418,4.371794871794871

6451803,3,B00KVVP4EA,"Although I wanted to love this movie, I was very disappointed. Paganini was a great composer and possibly the greatest violinist in history. David Garrett is a brilliant musician and a charismatic performer. It should have been a match made in heaven. It wasn't. The script was weak and offered no real insights into Paganini as a person (except for his weaknesses). David Garrett didn't have much to do on screen except to look sullen, sulky, and sultry--and to play the violin occasionally, which he didn't get to do often enough in my opinion. The movie failed to showcase the genius of either man. Niccolo Paganini and David Garrett both deserved better.",1483660800,9,658,4.883928571428571

6451814,4,B00KVVP4EA,"""The Devil's Violinist"" by Bernard Rose is an excellent movie for any lover of classical music or anyone looking to ""escape life"" for a couple of hours.  The costumes were great, including Urbani's very tall top hat, and the music was incredible.  David Garrett, the actor/violinist who played Paganini, was not my favorite actor in the movie, but he is actually no ""actor"" at all for he is a professional violinist - and considered by many to be the greatest living violinist.  The story was interesting and kept me engaged throughout.  That being said, I am no expert on Paganini so I cannot speak on the historical accuracy other than the fact that Niccol&ograve; Paganini was a legendary and extremely famous violinist in his day.

I rated this 4 stars because it kept me entertained the entire time with lovely costumes, good acting (especially by Jarred Harris who played Urbani), and incredible violin music.  It is certainly worth a watch!",1472083200,,947,4.8875
6451815,5,B00KVVP4EA,"I knew this lovely man was a violin genius, and I love what he does.  Had no idea that he could hold your interest in  film as well.  Amazing is used often and in this case it fits.  Wonderful movie and one I will watch again and again!",1470441600,,236,3.8541666666666665
6451816,1,B00KVVP4EA,"This movie is an excretion.
Only a sliver of it had any relationship to Paganini's actual life. The script is laughable and VERY pretentious.

But the film's death-blow was the mis-casting of David Garrett in the lead.
As an actor, he is wooden and soul-less.
As a violinist, he is merely so-so.

But his hair...Oh mercy, his hair! His hair is PURE GENIUS!  Billowing, silky and long; cavorting coquettishly from his head and over his shoulders, then suddenly leaping through the air, arcing high above his head in a frenzied halo of passionate terpsichore; shafts of light cutting through it like shooting stars, dazzling the viewer with it's lithe, flowing tresses, before wafting down again like a fragrant tropical waterfall. It is a glorious tribute to the art of hair-conditioning!

Like Samson, without it Garrett would have no career.  A career he has built entirely upon the shoulders of his hairdresser.
But more power to him. It's not his fault that audiences are so easily fooled. They tend to listen with their eyes and not their ears.

Oh, and just so future director's will remember, a shaky hand-held camera does not automatically equate to a great film.
If you are subject to motion sickness, I recommend a large dose of Dramamine before attempting to watch.",1468627200,2,1275,4.906976744186046

The movie, once in a while leads in that direction but for the most part sticks with the man himself, Paganini and his ""manager"" who seemed to want complete control over him at all times. The performances by all were magnificent, the music was magnificent and the scenery was magnificent. This movie showed him as a womanizer and a drunkard and a drug addict.

My only objection is the blatant sleaze thrown at us.  It could have been handled  remotely.  If I could have cuts to make it pg, then it could introduce children to great music and maybe inspire more violinists.

I could not help but compare this to the Humoresque film where a young Issac Stern played the violin music to Garfield's artist.  Well worth watching if you love violin music.",1441238400,,518,4.752808988764045

Add sports stars to that today-similarity.  Think of Michael Jackson, Bill Cosby, and Tiger Woods in the News.  Viewers of discs are often listening to the 10W closely-spaced little speakers built into their TVs;  I use separate amplifiers on the L and R stereo audio fed to excellent headphones.  Those headphone result in wide stereo separation and wide frequency response, a wonderful experience of the music.  I have a 75 inch LED TV and even it has puny internal audio which is inadequate for the Blu-ray stereo sound, giving an equivalent to old Mono.  The rear-panel stereo audio output is NOT so limited.  In conclusion, this is a great movie for music, singing, and appropriate acting.

6451892,5,B00KVVP4EA,"Bernard Rose offers us a highly entertaining and jaded glimpse into the life and times of Nicola Paganini.
Under his direction, the film assumes a decidedly urbane personality that perfectly mirrors the tragically enticing and self promoting personality of the celebrated violinist/composer.

The successful decision to depict the popular myth of Paganinis collusion with an agent of Lucifer floats deftly like gossamer on the caress of a whisper; but how else could it be when the enticement is being proffered by an all too obliging and charming enabler.

The viewer is reminded that, with or without enabling, we are only human and all too often we are our own worst enemy.

David Garret is also only all too happy to oblige his viewers and bask in the spotlight of celebrity, and does so with great flourish and enthusiasm which is perfect for his portrayal of the emotionally volatile Paganini.

Yes, the sets were lavish, and Jared Harris and the other supporting actors and actresses give excellent to good performances. But I was very disappointed in the acting performance of David Garett. He came across to both me and my wife as a great looking, talented musician whose acting performance was not at the same level as his violin playing or the performances of his peers in this movie. I was also disappointed in the limited number of violin performances. After the first 50 minutes, my wife and I capitulated upon the realization that Garett's acting was not going to improve, and so the balance of our time was spent searching the movie for those parts of it which featured violin performances. I can only remember three, of which two were very good and the third, an onstage duet about midway through the movie, was fantastic! It merited three rewinds to watch over and over again. That little clip was worth the small rental fee. So don't give up if you rent this flick and become disappointed with the acting - go forth with fast forward to find the scene I've described.

There was much too much time spent on the ridiculous women protesters banging their drums (literally!) and chanting, and far too little explanation of such things as the sudden appearance of a young son Where was his mother? WHO was his mother, even?  I - and Im sure most David Garrett fans - watched this movie to see him demonstrate his incredible skill, talent and passion for the violin.  We got some of that.  Not enough, but what was shown was worth the price of the video.  As to the wooden acting, well hes no Brando, but a) he was given awful dialogue (whoever wrote the script should be ashamed!) and b) he has incredible looks and stage presence.

So, like many women, I could watch and listen to David Garrett all day. Devastatingly talented, outrageously beautiful. (I confess I wanted to be the Charlotte character merely because Garretts Paganini is so infatuated with her.)
Shame to me, I cannot recall the name of the actor who plays Urbani - but here he brings his usual perfection!
