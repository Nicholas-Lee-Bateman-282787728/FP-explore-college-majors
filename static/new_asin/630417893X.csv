800367,5,630417893X,"Thirty Five years later since it first hit the screens in the MOVIE theatres, I have to say I can still watch this movie again and again. Audrey will remain THE ELIZA DOOLITTLE for many generations to come. Sure  she didn't sing ALL the songs--but the performance was not just the songs,  the regal bearing, the whimsical look, the  figure to look undernourished  then delicate---no way was Julie Andrews near this image.",930700800,,421,4.805555555555555
800368,5,630417893X,"Only ""West Side Story"" and ""The Sound of Music"" can compare with this lavishly designed, profoundly well-acted rendering of the Broadway smash hit that people still love today. Although Audrey Hepburn is  my favorite actress (along with Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, Kate Winslet  and Marissa Tomei) I still think Julie Andrews should have had the role of  Eliza Doolittle for the film version. It has been said by many (including  Audrey) that although she wanted the part and was grateful for it she did  feel that Julie should have had the part especially after it was revealed  that Audrey would be performing a small part of the singing and the rest of  it would be dubbed by Marni Nixon (the famous ""ghost singer"" who  had also dubbed Deborah Kerr in 1956 for ""The King and I"" and  Natalie Wood in 1961 for ""West Side Story"" and a year after  ""Fair Lady"" came out in the movies she would be playing as well  as singing the part of Sister Sophia in the film version of ""The Sound  of Music"" (which was her first on screen performance). Rex Harrison in  the role of his career won the Best Actor Oscar to no suprise that year for  his brilliant portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins. The previous year's  best actress winner Patricia Neil (winner of 1963's ""Hud"") had  just had a life-altering stroke and was too ill to attend the '64 Oscars  and announce the year's best actor. So, at the last minute, Audrey was  asked to present the award. When Harrison won he asked Audrey to stand next  to him on the podium to thank her as well as Julie Andrews (who was in the  audience and who ironically won the best actress Oscar that same year for  ""Mary Poppins"" while Audrey was not even nominated for ""Fair  Lady""-due to the fact that the Academy wanted to ""punish""  her for stealing the part from Julie) for allowing him to work with the two  of them and expressed his ""deep love for...well two fair ladys"".  Audrey and Julie were all smiles backstage for publicity pictures with  Harrison, best director winner George Cukor (who had won his 1st Oscar [for  director of ""Fair Lady""] after at five nominations) and Jack L.  Warner (who won the best picture Oscar for ""Fair Lady""). This  film is really a milestone in the history of musical films. See it if you  havn't already and see it again if you have. It's always worth another  look.",924652800,2,2338,4.548076923076923

Overhearing this bet is a flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn); she wants to work a flower stand. But they will not take her unless she can speak more ""genteel"". Professor Higgins takes up the challenge.
Will he succeed?
What does her father (Stanley Holloway) thing finding that she moved in whit the two professors and did not want any clothes?

This is a musical version of the movie Pygmalion (1938), based on a play by George Bernard Shaw.

As people find that music and movies bring memories of the time in which they heard or viewed it. His movie has a meaning to me as I too was in love and found my self singing ""On the street where you live."" One of the strengths of the movie is that many of the songs instead of being classical and just stuffed into at odd times actually are songs that you would initiate in your life and they did so in the lives of the characters in the movie.

I am sure that technology, as Blu-ray will try to improve on this film. In addition, I suspect there will be other DVD extras. Yet no matter which product you buy, you will be satisfied with this film.",1505088000,,1375,4.492

I tried to advance to the next scene and back up, but had no operational control of my player and had to pull the power cord in order to gain any operation. I had to do it again as I figured the first time was a fluke. When I figured there was a serious issue, I advanced past scene 20 to scene 21. When it got to the big scene prior to the Hungarian scene, it happened again. So, there were two spots in the Blu-Ray with major flaws.

This is my third copy that does this in the exact same place.  All were pressed at the same plant in Mexico.  I am using a Yamaha BD-S677.  Software is fully up to date and do not have any single blu ray or DVD (of my vast collection) that does this.  Could this problem be unique to this particular player.  Unlikely.

802224,5,630417893X,"It mainly tells story about a beautiful young lady-- Eliza Doolittle. She is a girl with happiness, even the place she lives is dirty and crowd. she never lets smile slipped out from her face. As we know, a girl has a prince in her heart; a boy has a fair lady in his mind. So does Eliza Doolittle. She has a dream, a warm house with her lover, and a lot of chocolates to eat. Wouldnt it be lovely?
This flower girl came across an English Linguistic professor ----Henry Higgins, who is a typical English wealthy and defiant bachelor. He regards marriage the most boring and troublesome thing in the world. Eliza became the bet goal of the linguist and his friends actually. Higgins decides to improve Elizas cockney accent and train her to be an elegant lady. Through clever phrases such as ""the rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain"", Eliza slowly develops into a linguistically talented woman. To complete the transformation, she is given new clothes and a new look in hopes that she can pass for a refined lady. It is at a horse race that he chooses to expose her to the element he wants desperately to accept her. Prof. Higgins nearly finds success until her rambunctious nature releases itself in the heat of excitement surrounding the equine tournament. Believing he may have failed and growing angry with her failures, a rift begins to develop between the two which eventually explodes in tempers causing them to part ways. Meanwhile, Eliza has caught the attention of awkward young aristocrat Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett) who loves her in spite of her flaws. He succeeded finally, but he realized that he had fell in love with his experiment at the same time! Own point of view / analysis.
I like this film primarily because it is a musical type film, characters of the dialogue and some psychological shows mostly in relax and humorous music sung. In addition, this is the first time that I contact Audrey Hepburn's film. Although she is internationally famous for her work, to see her performance, I think its a well-deserved reputation. The process that the flower girl changed into an elegant lady is so vivid. When she was forced to learn the pronunciation, she was so discontented to Higgins. The part which she cursed Higgins was sung out in rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment of music, full of fun. How cute she was! In addition, when the Cinderella into"" Princess"", she is so out of the ordinary, Audrey Hepburn made this huge difference so vivid, the flower girl innocence, self-esteem character behaves so remarkably, her acting skills was perfect in my eye.
My Fair Lady is one of half-a-dozen musicals that captured the Best Picture prize at the Oscars. It is typical of the awards-worthy work that graced the screen during this period. Punctuated with lavish costumes and vivid sets, Lady is every bit the entertainment spectacle one might expect. This is a great musical, a good movie and it was even better as the original play.",1482019200,,2962,4.764591439688716

802395,5,630417893X,"This is the definitive Blu-ray version to own for this marvelous film.  The picture quality is absolutely stunning.  The film looks so fresh, vibrant, clean, and detailed from the water trickling down the pillars of a church in the streets of London to the detailed textures of Professor Henry's wallpaper and study.  The costumes and sets all really pop out and shine gloriously as well do the outstanding performances (we get to appreciate even more the beautiful face and performance of Audrey Hepburn from seeing her gorgeous eyes watering down to each strand of her hair).
  The sound quality is crystal clear whether on a home theater speaker system or just on the speakers of your HD TV - all the actors and actresses' voices can be heard clearly with the music and singing sounding wonderful, full, sharp, and clear.  The horses' hooves and the pedestrians' feet on the cobble stone streets, the wonderful dialogue and singing of Rex Harrison as the exasperated Higgins, and Audrey Hepburn's cockney accent, voice, and singing (filled in by Marni Nixon whose beautiful singing I believe matches Hepburn's voice very well) are all amplified and enjoyed even more.
  The film, because it has such a great story, and engrossing, witty, brilliant dialogue (and lyrics), has tons of replay value.  It's one of those films that the more you watch it the more you appreciate and understand it even more.  The film deservedly won academy awards for best picture, best director, and best actor, but how the film didn't also win an award for best screenplay is beyond me.  The screenplay and dialogue has got more wit, humor, and substance than hundreds of movies made today combined.  Aspiring screenwriters could take many lessons from this film on how to construct meaningful, intelligent, deep, and character-driven dialogue.  I kept finding myself remembering and re-pondering Higgins and Eliza's lines long after they said them while watching. The movie is truly brilliant.
  Professor Henry Higgins and flower girl Eliza Dolittle's complex relationship/friendship - their anger, grief, frustration, and attraction with each other with both of them finally realizing at the end how much they really need and really want the other - is what makes the film so brilliant, romantic, touching, hilarious, and profound.
  The film is entertaining and appealing on so many levels and the characters - well-written and defined - really do shine. All the songs are memorable from Alfred P. Dolittle's hilarious ""With a little bit of luck' and Eliza Dolittle's romantic and beautiful ""Wouldn't it be loverly?"" to Henry Higgins' revelatory, funny, and touching ""There's just something in her face.""
  I wish more films could be made of such a quality as this one. It is a special gem worth owning and is one of the best films ever written and ever made.

802689,4,630417893X,"Many of the top-ranked ""My Fair Lady"" reviews on Amazon refer to a defective and out-of-date 2011 Blu-Ray release.

The 2015 50th Anniversary re-restoration fixes the issues from the earlier, inferior restoration.

The visual quality is simply stunning.

I don't have a home-theater system, so I can't offer expert opinion about the audio, however, I did experience an initial fluttering or card-shuffling sound with the English 7.1 Dolby TrueHD track. The noise disappeared when I switched to one of the alternate audio tracks (six languages) and then switched back to English.

The packaging is appropriately chic and feels sturdy initially, but the container is made mostly out of card stock, and I suspect it will suffer above-average wear and tear over time.

Unlike earlier releases, I think this edition of ""My Fair Lady"" truly measures up to Blu-Ray standards.",1471132800,4,868,5.215827338129497

802822,4,630417893X,Pygmalion was meant to satirize the rigid British class system of that period while also adding commentary on women and their fight for independence.  Add music and an almost happy ending and you have My Fair Lady.  Not exactly what Shaw had intended but close enough.  The music is fantastic (although Julie Andrews would have sung the part better than Marni Nixon did).  Rex Harrison and Wilfrid Hyde-White are hilarious as the conniving pair anxious to win a bet that they can turn a drudge into a princess.  The costumes are impossible yet incredible (an Oscar for Cecil Beaton).  An almost perfect musical (Audrey Hepburn notwithstanding).,1468972800,,644,5.028301886792453

I don't think I want to spend this much time to watch the thing if I have to precede the viewing with 20 minutes of rassling to get out the disc.

803154,5,630417893X,"Last week I watched My Fair Lady for perhaps the 50th time since I first saw it in a theater way back in 1965. This film has always ranked very high on my Top 10 list of favorite movies, and places an extremely close second to The Sound of Music on my list of favorite musicals.

I have watched My Fair Lady in many home video formats: Betamax and VHS tape cassettes, DVD, and Blu-ray. When I watched this film last week, there was one major difference:  I was watching the 50th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray, which is an all-new 4K restoration of the film. The difference between it and all previous versions Ive seen was so dramatic that it seemed like I was watching the movie for the very first time.

For those not familiar with My Fair Lady, the film is based on George Bernard Shaws play Pygmalion, Set in early 20th century London, its a musical comedy about a lowly flower girl named Eliza Doolittle, who has a chance encounter with a linguistic professor named Henry Higgins. Professor Higgins makes a bet with a friend that he can teach Eliza to speak such perfectly proper English that he can pass her off as royalty at an embassy ball. My Fair Lady stars Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway, and Wilfrid Hyde-White. It has some of the best acting and most entertaining musical numbers Ive ever seen in a movie.

I always found earlier home video editions of My Fair Lady disappointing. Video quality always seemed grainy and colorless, and showed many of the flaws and anomalies inherent in the aging source material. The versions on Betamax and VHS videocassette were particularly bad. Later releases on DVD and Blu-ray were better, although they still showed many of the same flaws.

What was needed was a complete restoration. When the 50th Anniversary Edition was released in 2015, it was immediately evident that My Fair Ladys restoration team had done things right. The new 4K scan shows astounding video quality from the very first frame! Colors are perfect, images are sharp and detailed, and film grain is natural but unobtrusive. I didn't see any banding, crushing, dirt, speckles, or other anomalies anywhere. The lossless DTS Master Audio soundtrack completely filled my viewing space with gorgeous 5.1 surround audio.

The 50th Anniversary edition of My Fair Lady is a two-disc combo-pack that contains the 4K restoration of the film on one Blu-ray disc,  and a plethora of  bonus features on the other. If youve never seen My Fair Lady in true high definition/surround sound, or if you're simply  looking to upgrade to the 4K restored version, this 50th Anniversary edition is the one to get.

Not only have they transferred it in 4K but they appear to have individually corrected each frame to ensure the final image is as true to the original print as it could. The 4K release would be outstanding I would imagine but until then, this 1080P transfer will do nicely.  Also the TrueHD audio is a revelation given the original sound stems they had.

DVDs and Blu Rays have been around for many years and there are standard cases for them that work fine unless a shipping company goes to extremes to damage them.  Every now and then some studio apparently feels their release is ""special"" and deserves a ""special"" case.  Given the usual results, these people should just be marched out and shot.  My Fair Lady comes in one of those fold-out cases that makes it harder to get the disc you want out without placing the thing on a table.  The case doesn't use standard hub mounts for the discs, no they had to be ""fancy"" and came up with the crazy idea of a little lip below the bottom quarter of each disc that you have to slide the disc in and out of.  It's a bit hard to get the disc in and tell that it is secured.  Normally fold-out cases come with a sleeve that the fold-out section is stored in.  That was too standard for these folks.  They made the fold-out sections clasp together with magnets.  Without the sleeve, the case is less stable and the folds move up and down relative to each other.

803457,4,630417893X,"Viewed on 96 1080p Panasonic projector (well calibrated) and high-end audio system.

Summary: EXCELLENT but not perfect.

Visual restoration quality ranges from very good to mind-blowingly awesome. Shows how good 70mm is! Wow!
-The flower introduction, oddly, looked terrible. Watching that had me scared the purchase was a waste
-Some of the darker areas of dark scenes (cabs at night in the rain) lacked contrast or dark areas were simply black. This may have been a limitation of the film
-Much of the movie was insanely well done. May have been the best Ive ever seen. Hepburn in the light-coloured ball dress, in the Professors dark-coloured house: Incredible color, contrast, clarity, almost 3d. She literally glows, jumps off the screen. WOW.

Audio restoration was very good but a bit more spotty
-Background noise levels varied in volume and type (scratchy, hiss) throughout the movie. I suspect most sound guys are deaf and cant hear above 8-10khz. The movie had significant hiss which should have been easy to filter out.
-Voice changes for Hepburn were very obvious
-Overall, very good audio, probably as good as they could get.

Packaging is very nice but for some odd reason, has the line MOVE YOUR BLOOMING ARSE! splashed huge-font across the inside of the case. THE ONE LINE with a wordy-dird. Fun to explain that to your 7yr old.",1454371200,2,1346,4.9688888888888885

Finally, the transfer this masterpiece deserves!

This is one of my favorite films. The story is classic, the score is great, the acting is wonderful, and every frame of cinematography is art.  Due to the reviews of the previous Blu-ray release, I avoided purchasing it so as not to be disappointed, and made do with my DVD for many years.

Now the restored colors and textures can be seen in their fully visualized glory. I have only dim childhood memories of seeing the film in 1964/5, but one thing I vividly recall is feeling like I was in the rooms with the characters. Watching this disk made me feel that way again.  Higgins' library/study with it's ornate, deeply colored woodwork and vivid carpets and furniture. That's my favorite set. The embassy ball, Alfie's pub crawl, the stair cases and halls of 27A Wimpole Street, the list goes on.

This is the transfer we've been waiting for.  At some point, I suppose it will be supplanted by 4K, but I'm completely satisfied with this edition until that time comes.",1450569600,7,1065,4.755434782608695

In 2011 CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Pictures released ""My Fair Lady"" to Blu-ray. They did a horrendous job, one of the worst Blu-ray movie transfers I had ever seen or heard. However, in 2015, thanks perhaps to a multitude of complaints, they rereleased the film to Blu-ray, this time with completely remastered picture and sound for a flawless 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition. It was a long wait, but it was worth it for one of filmdom's great, classic musicals.

Rex Harrison reprises his stage role as Professor Henry Higgens, the part for which fans will forever remember him.  Harrison was already an established star when he accepted the role in the musical, and it is one he seemed born to play. When the studio initially asked Cary Grant to do the movie role, Grant turned it down, saying if Harrison didn't get the part, he'd never do another film for them. Harrison is so convincing one would think he were the Professor in real life. I rather expect his fans thought he was, too. Shaw's play leaves the final relationship of the Professor and the flower girl ambiguous, but the musical is more romantic and hints at something more serious. It is a tribute to Harrison that audiences hardly notice the age difference between the two characters, although the twenty-one-year span is almost exactly what Shaw had in mind. Higgens's most notable songs are ""Why Can't the English?,"" ""I'm an Ordinary Man,"" ""The Rain in Spain,"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.""

The part of Miss Eliza Doolittle went to Audry Hepburn, and therein probably lies the movie's major point of contention. Julie Andrews had made the role her own on Broadway and record albums, and for audiences who had seen or heard her, it was inconceivable that anyone else should get the part. But the studio felt otherwise, unconvinced that Ms. Andrews had the necessary drawing power they thought the film needed and also a little wary of Ms. Andrew's photogenic qualities. So they went with what they considered a sure thing in superstar Audry Hepburn, causing not a little bitterness on the part of theatergoers everywhere. Meanwhile, Ms. Andrews went on to do ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" in the next year and half; and while the Academy didn't even nominate Ms. Hepburn for ""My Fair Lady,"" they gave Ms. Andrews the Best Actress Oscar for ""Poppins.""

None of which is to suggest that Ms. Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza is anything but delightful and charming. Yet the controversy was not to end there. Despite Ms. Hepburn's insistence that she do her own singing, Warners dubbed her voice by uncredited singer Marni Nixon, who had previously done the singing dubs in the movie versions of ""West Side Story"" and ""The King and I."" Again the studio got its way, and again there was a degree of bitterness involved, this time on the part of Ms. Hepburn, whom the studio had apparently assured could do the vocals and for which she had even rehearsed and filmed several. But it's all history now, and we will never know what more Ms. Andrews might have done with the role or, except for two songs mentioned below, what Ms. Hepburn might have done with the rest of the singing. Eliza's most celebrated songs include ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly,"" ""Just You Wait,"" ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" and ""Without You,"" among others.

The indefatigable Stanley Holloway plays Eliza's father, a role he did on Broadway, and he all but steals the show with his two cockney music-hall numbers, ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" and ""Get Me to the Church on Time."" In other notable parts, fans of English television's Sherlock Holmes will be tickled to see the late Jeremy Brett playing Eliza's young, lovesick, high-society admirer, Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and singing ""On the Street Where You Live"" (uncredited singing voice courtesy of Bill Shirley). Wilfrid Hyde-White plays Col. Pickering; Gladys Cooper plays the Professor's mother; and Theodore Bikel plays the deliciously unctuous Zoltan Karpathy (""Oozing charm from every pore, He oiled his way around the floor"").

The songs, cast, dialogue, direction, costumes, and set designs combine to make ""My Fair Lady"" one of the all-time great movie musicals in Hollywood history. The newest Blu-ray does it proud.

Video:
The first time around on Blu-ray (in 2011), the CBS/Paramount engineers apparently used the same 1994 restoration that had looked good on DVD, but they made no effort to restore the film any further for BD. Worse, they introduced some ugly artifacts into the BD, including some occasional white flecks and specks and an unconscionable blooming at the edges--maybe exposure issues, fading--in the lower sides of the screen that intensified as the film went on; and by the second half the print looked as though someone were shining a bright light on the image

Fortunately, for this new ""My Fair Lady"" 50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray edition, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Pictures asked restoration expert Robert Harris (who had done excellent work twenty years earlier with the restoration of the DVD) to head up the team restoring this new Blu-ray version of the film. The results look splendid. The colors are vivid; the object delineation is well-nigh perfect; the screen is clear and clean. The whole thing is gorgeous.

Audio:
It was remarkable that the first time around on Blu-ray, the CBS/Paramount audio engineers couldn't correctly transfer the sound of possibly the greatest musical of all time to disc. Through a misplaced enthusiasm in the use of the surrounds, the solo vocals on the older BD often appeared soft and hollow and the orchestral accompaniment too reverberant, sometimes cavernous. What's more, the engineers even cranked up the bass in a few scenes. It was pretty awful, and if you still have that older disc, you might consider making a 100% better upgrade to this newer BD edition if only for its improved audio.

For the current edition, the Dolby TrueHD 7.1 audio is excellent. That is, it reproduces the sound of the movie pretty much as I'm sure its original creators intended, but with a little more ambient action for a home setup equipped with multichannel sound. Instead of going all crazy with the surrounds and making the musical interludes appear as though the engineers recorded them in a barrel, the engineers perfectly blend the singing and orchestral accompaniment in the front channels where they belong, with a touch of ambient bloom from the surrounds to provide depth and dimension. Voices sound natural, whether in song or dialogue, and the orchestra sounds realistic. The frequency extremes are maybe a little less extended than we find today, but it's hardly an issue.

Extras:
The extras include a second Blu-ray disc with a ton of extras, plus a third disc containing a DVD version of the movie. But it's the second BD that has most of the bonus items, starting with a 1994 making-of documentary, ""More Loverly Than Ever: My Fair Lady Then and Now."" Next, there is a series of vintage featurettes, including the 1963 production kickoff dinner; the film's Los Angeles and British premieres; a Rex Harrison radio interview; George Cukor directing the Baroness Rothschild; some production tests; alternate Audrey Hepburn vocals; and comments on the film by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Martin Scorsese.

Following these items are several more things, including ""The Story of a Lady,"" ""Design of a Lady,"" and ""The Fairest Fair Lady""; Cecil Beaton sketches, black & white stills; color production stills; documents and publicity; plus seven different trailers, and three awards featurettes.

The disc extras conclude with fifty scene selections; English, German, Spanish, Italian, French, and Japanese spoken languages; English, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Finally, CBS/Paramount have packaged the three discs in a beautiful, glossy, trim-line, foldout case that is among the most attractive I've seen. It is in itself a small work of art.

Parting Thoughts:
As pure entertainment ""My Fair Lady"" makes other musicals seem almost crude by comparison, and it deserves to be the standard by which we judge other musicals. Movie fans' concerns about Julie Andrews notwithstanding, the film is absolutely loverly, now with Blu-ray picture and sound to do it justice.

The quality Video:
Simply perfect. It seems to be a new movie. So in this way they don't need to create remake (I'm really worried for Mary Poppins). I prefer they majors invest on restoration of masterpiece. As a work of art, a movie need cure and to be adapted to the new technologies.

Audio:

Great in English, Good in French and Japanese. Sound mono in Italian (pity because the singing voice is really amazing). Not good audio in Spanish.

Oh heck, for the die-hard fans anxious about how it would look after years of teasing and release date delays, it's downright orgasmic.  Forget about the reviews of the blu-ray from a few years ago, the 2015 version is at last the real deal!!!

From the moment the action began after the title credits, I knew we were in for quite a treat.  After managing to pick up my jaw from the floor, I put in the blurry DVD from the late 90's for comparison, and there was none.  The 2015 restoration looks and sounds nearly like a new modern film.  Robert Harris and his team deserve high praise indeed for this masterpiece of technical and artistic achievement.

From a long time avid fan's perspective, I can genuinely and honestly say that seeing this movie again in such crazy good quality literally brought me to tears, it's that satisfying.  It's like falling in love with Audrey Hepburn all over again.  She looks thoroughly ***STUNNING*** in her many dresses throughout the film.  I must have paused the playback a couple dozen times just to stare at the crisp and colorful imagery now available with this new blu-ray.

For those with a 4K TV, you're in for a ""loverly"" bonus as the new version upscales very nicely to reveal details you've never been able to see before.

This Blu-Ray restoration (by the brilliant Robert Harris, may God keep him healthy) sets new standards in the profession. Absolutely wonderful as older great Blu Ray restorations such as Ben Hur, Cleopatra, The Sound Of Music, or Lawrence of Arabia are, this is possibly even higher in quality - resolution, color palette, incredible detail. [Aside: the most recent restoration of ""Spartacus"" is also wonderful!] Even the soundtrack has been restored in such a way.... SACD quality, it feels like you're there.

804305,4,630417893X,"UPDATE 8/28/15: I'm amused at the reviews of this, as this particular version, down converted from a 4k scan to HD, has never been released. There have been 2 releases: 1 DVD with color cover, and 1 Blu-ray with same. Pictured Blu-ray B&W  cover (except Hepburn) is the down converted from 4k to HD version. This restored version, scanned at 4k, is quite late from its previously announced due date. I suppose now they have to aim for the ""51rst Anniversary"" release. I saw one scene from the 4k restoration late last year (2014) and came away with the nagging suspicion something was terribly wrong with the picture. In deference to the wonderful and capable team doing the 4k restoration I will not mention my concern here. The fact that the release has been delayed suggests they noticed the problem and are fixing it (??). One of the issues in dealing with any 4k or higher material is the lack of monitor equipment that performs to the full capacity of the video. It is hard to see all the resolution on a 30""w or so 4k direct view monitor. Projectors are better at showing resolution, but they have their unique problems as well. So why 4k down converted to a standard 2k HD Blu-ray? Because down sampling saves a great deal of the nuisance from the 4k scan. Check out Baraka: A World Beyond Words (from an 8k transfer) and Lawrence of Arabia (4k), or other 8/4k scans down converted. A picture is worth a thousand words! For those who prefer to own their films, search on ""Blu-ray 4k"" to see what is coming towards the end of 2015.",1435190400,3,1538,4.512544802867383

""I was serenely independent and content before we met. Surely I could always be that way again... and yet.""
There's almost nobody like Hepburn, and this is her supreme role. Innocent, lovely, diffident...and yet...

804503,5,630417893X,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie (especially this ""Two-Disc Special Edition"" that came out in 2004), and I am NOT a big fan of movie musicals.  I RARELY, if you knew me, give 5 STARS for ANY movie.  But, this one is VERY, VERY special.  ""My Fair Lady"" (1964, with the 1994 restored version GREAT, in this ""Two-Disc Special Edition"") is one of the GREATEST movies of ALL TIME, in my TOP 5 of ALL TIME, and I have seen thousands of movies over many years, and still see hundreds each year at theaters and at home.  I've seen this movie at least 35 times on DVD; I hope to someday see it in a theater on film(or maybe 4K or 8K digital) in its original 70mm (not the 35mm that most films are/were shot in)), and it NEVER GETS OLD to watch with such great acting by ALL the actors, fantastic detailed sets, great/fabulous costumes, wonderful story, great music, etc.  Audrey Hepburn should have, for SURE, WON the 1965 ""Oscar for Best Actress"", and NOT Julie Andrews for ""Mary Poppins"" (which I've also seen many times, and am a big fan of Julie Andrews, but her ""Mary Poppins"" performance was NOT even CLOSE to Audrey Hepburn's as Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady"" (even if most of Audrey's singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon, but should NOT have been dubbed at all, and Audrey was promised before agreeing to do the movie that ALL of her own singing would be done with NO dubbing by someone else)).  She was slighted/rebuffed/treated shabbily/treated unfairly by the members of the Academy who vote for the nominations and vote for the winners of the Oscars.  Even Julie Andrews admits in not those exact words that Audrey should've won the Oscar, and not her.  It was all Oscars' politics at the time in 1964-1965, and the Academy should be ASHAMED of themselves for not nominating her, let alone voting for her to win the Oscar for Best Actress at the 1965 Oscars.  ""My Fair Lady"" won 8 Oscars in 1965 (37th Academy Awards) (including: Best Picture (Jack L. Warner producer), Best Director (George Cukor), Best Actor (Rex Harrison)) and was nominated for 12 Oscars.  It should have won 9 Oscars with Audrey Hepburn as Best Actress, and been, with her nomination, nominated for 13 Oscars.  (Also, Gene Allen the Art Director, was also the ONLY ""Production Designer"" and was also the ""Assistant Director"" if not ""Co- Director"" with the great director, George Cukor.  ""My Fair Lady"" was released in the U.S. on 12/25/1964, almost 51 years ago.  Gene Allen is now 96 years old, as I type this, on 17 March 2015, with practically ALL of the cast and others involved with the movie now deceased: Audrey Hepburn (at 63 years old in January 1993), Rex Harrison (at 82 years old in June 1990), etc.)  One final note, Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz did a SUPERB job of SAVING (film poorly stored, and almost lost forever) and RESTORING ""My Fair Lady"" on 70mm film and digitally, for the 30 years' anniversary of the movie, with the restored version released in 1994, taking a very painstakingly 2 years to do the restoration with the large financial assistance of CBS Corp. that owns the rights to ""My Fair Lady"",which were loaned to Jack L. Warner (Warner Bros.) for a few years, starting in 1963, to make the 1964 movie ""My Fair Lady"".)",1426550400,3,3233,4.570934256055363

Some of the features were good but I couldn't stand the commentary after about 10 minutes because it was so boring and instead of discussing what was going on in the scenes and the actors they went off on tangents about the restoration while the glorious movie was playing on the screen.  Just not good enough.  I can see why Audrey Hepburn was not allowed to do her own singing.  While she has a nice voice, it is in no way professional sounding and would have been very out of place in the movie.  She sounded like what she is, a nice amateur.  But, love this movie.

805152,4,630417893X,"Restoration:  As reported here in many posts, the restored version of ""My Fair Lady"" available on Blu Ray seems to have a foggy edge on the outside of the picture frame.  Well, here are some points to make with this restored film.  The film is held under CBS and was housed in their vault, and that vault seemed to have sustained damage in the Northridge earthquake.  Even more confusing was that MGM (*) did not hold on to any additional elements were thrown away.  Audio recordings as well.  The team of Robert Harris and James Katz had only the original negative to work on.  This negative was breaking down during the restoration process.
I could go on, but if you can live with the faded edge of this restoration, buy the blu ray.  The sound could have been a little better, but the film was a short step from being lost, and this restoration should shed some much needed light into the condition of many of our beloved films.

NOW, THERE IS A NEW RELEASE COMING IN NOV, 2014!  A combo pack with Blu-Ray, DvD, and a third disk.  But there are no info about the transfer of the film!
I am hoping that the original transfer of the restored film had technical problems, and that this new release will not have the foggy edges that all of us have seen.  Posts on other sites indicate that CBS video has kept this new restoration under wraps.  The info about the new release is sparse right now.  So, keep an eye out for new reviews, after the release date.  $28.99 seems to be a lot of money to throw down for another poor transfer of this film, but the cover of the box states,""Magnificent New restoration!"".  The new print was scanned in 8k downsized to 4k for the Blu-Ray.  I still tip my hats off the the gentlemen who saved the film before it was damaged beyond repair.  The new restoration was scanned by Robert Harris.

Eliza, as she insists, is a ""good girl"", and the only things she's selling are flowers. Eliza is played by the exquisite Audrey Hepburn.

Can he turn her into a perfect lady? Can he teach her to speak English, proper English? or will she continue yulping and mutilating English into a Cockney, cacophonous mess?

They know all the words to half the songs & I'll hear them singing them while they're playing together.  SO CUTE!  I had to buy the soundtrack for them.

I have been in love with this film ever since I saw it in a theater and have bought VHS, and regular and special editions DVD.
In my opinion the movie has never looked or sounded better than it does on blu-ray in my home theater right now, not even the way I remember seeing it in a theater.

On a  slightly disappointed note, extra features are the same as in a Special Edition DVD. but that is a very small point. The main thing is that Fair Lady can hardly look or sound better in home theater. So just get it, you'll be glad you did, as I am right now!!",1392681600,,773,4.287671232876712

805784,5,630417893X,"I consider this the best movie ever made, better than Star Wars, which was the first move I saw in the theaters when I was 6 1/2. I didn't watch My Fair Lady until I was in my early 30s. Had I watched it as a kid, I might not have appreciated it as much as I do now. The plot is simple yet intriguing, the casting and acting superb, the music incredibly memorable. This was made at the height of musicals with actors at the height of their careers.

The blu-ray image seem better than the DVD image, but you have to be fairly close to a large TV to see the difference. 4K is a scam, most people will NEVER be able to see the difference between a good 1080p and 4K image. So buy the blu-ray and don't worry about buying a 4K video (which I'm sure they'll eventually release).",1392336000,2,774,4.0588235294117645

806010,5,630417893X,"I have just finished watching this last night. This is the  Two Disc Special Edition. I have read the older reviews which mention the difference in picture quality between this and the previous 1-disc release. I haven't seen that version, so I can't comment on it. However, the differences must be very slight. This version is beautiful. I don't spend my time scanning the picture for slight defects. I have a VHS copy that I taped off TCM several years ago. It was good, but of course the colors were not vibrant. To preserve it I transferred it to Blu-Ray, waiting for a true BD version release. The reviews of the BD version have been disappointing, so went with the 2-Disc. I compared it to my older copy, the colors were as I recall from the original screening. Now, I am not a fan of most musical film. I never could stand the actors breaking into song every other scene. This was different, the music and song were not the focus of the story, but enhanced it at the proper time. This is one of my favorite films. I saw it when it was released back in '64/'65 and I saw the play at the Circle Arts Theater in San Diego back in the '60s. If you like the  Bernard Shaw story itself, I recommend the 1938 'Pygmalion', starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller (I believe she was Shaw's choice to play Eliza). It's Black & White naturally, but it features two of Britain's finest actors. Same Characters; Higgins, Eliza, Pickering, etc.",1389484800,,1436,4.477099236641221

The plot is about turning a dirty-faced flower-seller into someone who can be passed off as a lady to snobbish London society; it is really about how a dirty-faced flower-seller turns an arrogant stuffed shirt into a human, to words and music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.

Hepburn is mesmerizing as Eliza, the cockney flower girl who is transformed into a princess-like elegant beauty.  Rex Harrison plays the arrogant, somewhat heartless Professor who takes the ugly duckling on.

The costumes delight.  The music is enchanting. It's a classic story that comes to life most winningly in this film.
If you enjoy musicals from their golden age, you will want to see this one.  Note that Hepburn doesn't do her own singing. It is the kind of film I can watch every year.",1381968000,,582,4.7227722772277225

806446,5,630417893X,"I bought this Special Edition and as I watched the ending I thought I would review it. I just had to get this out of my system. Although it is one of the best musicals ever made by Jack Warner studios et al and I did watch all the special features on the second disc, however I feel that they should not have made Henry so chauvinistic in his relationship to Eliza Doolittle. And even her last name created a stigma for her as a flower girl turned into a Fair Lady. I feel he treated her horridly bad. The ending really shocked me. When she comes back to him after not marrying Freddy the handsome, jobless Casanova, singing ""Here on the street where you live,"" Henry simply asks her in a smug manner, ""where are my blasted slippers?"" He is sitting in a wooden chair with his hat pulled down over his head and his back to her instead of getting up to embrace her with a hug and a kiss. How awful! What a wonderful ending that would have made. That is the ending that would have endeared millions and myself to this lovely story. But as it is, I think it rather stinks for that reason and the writers missed a marvelous opportunity to make all women more loved and respected in America. I feel that film started an attitude in the minds of men that women are just for slipper fetching, dinner making and sex. This is my own opinion but I am sure I am not the only one who saw that and cringed. But over all, it was well done and the acting is superb. I am sorry Audrey did not win an Oscar that year the her performance. I heard Julie Andrews say that her Oscar ""was a sympathy vote"" for not getting the role of Eliza in the film when she has made it famous in the Broadway Musical for over three years running with Rex. So sad! I recommend this 1994 restoration DVD with wonderful special features. Five stars!",1379116800,,1810,4.204022988505747

I had seen Pygmalion (1938) while I was in high school and knew this was a musical version of it.  I liked it, though I was content with that single viewing.  But when I saw my wife light up as she talked about how she wished we owned a copy, I went ahead and ordered My Fair Lady, along with Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, as part of her anniversary gift.

I have to admit this was one of the funniest movies I have seen.  Alfred P. Doolittle has to be my favorite character in the whole movie.  His songs and scenes had me rolling.  I have since watched it with my kids and they have come to love it, as well.  Definitely worth the money and a great family movie to boot.",1378944000,,810,4.10828025477707

The music arises naturally out of the story and joins one scene to another beautifully.  It is a fairy tale, of course, in which a poverty-stricken Cockney flower seller (Audrey Hepburn) is transformed into a princess by a linguist (Rex Harrison), who teaches her how to speak proper English and drills her in the social graces of London society. Her tutor is a boorish, self-centered snob, whose own mother can barely tolerate him.  Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison make this story both believable and delightful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending offers an unexpected and disappointing outcome to what would otherwise have been a triumph for the flower-girl- turned-princess.",1373241600,,805,4.940740740740741

Audrey Hepburn might not have been the greatest choice to play Eliza - her Cockney accent is execrable, and her songs dubbed by Marni Nixon (even though the recent Blu-Ray version has footage of Hepburn actually trying to sing) - but she manages to capture the waif-life quality of the character. Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway are definitive in their roles; once you have seen them, it's difficult to imagine anyone else performing them.

807505,5,630417893X,"Much has been said over the years regarding the turn of events that led to Audrey Hepburn playing cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle instead of Julie Andrews--who sung the role on stage.  Despite the nearly universal acknowledgement that the role was better suited to Andrews, I still find this movie thoroughly enjoyable!

My favorite scene is where the verbally reformed Eliza is first presented to society--at the opening of the races at Ascot.  Here Miss Hepburn is wearing the dress shown on the cover of this DVD.  In this scene she is just incredibly beautiful, as this dress provides just the right accent for her elegant figure!  My wife observed that this dress brought to mind some of the better efforts from Project Runway (for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finale-Part-II-HD/dp/B009TJ1Q6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finale, Part II [HD</a>]).  I also enjoyed her character's amusing efforts to blend upper class manners with cockney wit!

Another element of this movie that I found interesting is the origin of the story itself.  As the stage musical was inspired by George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, it is interesting to note that Shaw's character Henry Higgins was based, to some degree, upon the Oxford philologist Henry Sweet (1845-1912), whose specialty included the study of Old English (see Sweet's famous book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Anglo-Saxon-Primer-with-Grammar-Notes-and-Glossary-Eighth-Edition-Revised-8th/dp/B003IMKOU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Anglo-Saxon Primer with Grammar, Notes, and Glossary (Eighth Edition, Revised - 8th)</a>, Old Norse, and the use of phonetics in transcribing modern dialects.  Evidently, Henry Sweet was infamously irascible--and to such a degree, that by comparison, Henry Higgins would seem to be steeped in the social graces!",1353715200,,1900,6.305019305019305

I didn't check for English subtitles, which I usually show on my Movie Night Parties with my international friends (who could hardly be expected to follow all the diverse accents in this movie), but if the reviews saying they do not exist are true, makes it an even worse choice.

And of course the embassy ball, where Liza dances with the prince and convinces Zoltan Karpathy (that hairy hound) that she is a Hungarian princess in disguise, is priceless. So is her day at the Ascot races.

Perhaps I'm just too jaded, but I can't help thinking about the fact that Rex Harrison puts more into ""Why Can't A Woman Be More Like a Man"" and ""I Shall Never Let a Woman in My Life"" than he does into ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.""

Admirers of Andrew Lloyd Webber (of which I am one, btw) may quibble, but to me this was the pinnacle of Broadway fare; a high bar from the standpoint of songs, book, and character, not to mention overall wit. Of course, with George Bernard Shaw supplying your source material, it's difficult to go wrong (though it has been known to happen: see the film The Millionairess, for example).

The production values for this were stellar, as was the cast -- in particular Harrison and Hepburn. As good as Marni Nixon's voice is in dubbing for Hepburn, it's a pity they didn't allow her to sing. I've heard some of her tracks, and they were perfectly passable. Purists will disagree, of course, but if Harrison could be allowed to talk through his songs, the least they could have done was allow Audrey to sing hers.

Forget all the disheartening reviews you may have read re the MFL BD.....it is absolutely stunning.
If you think the dvd (even with upscaling) is good-forget it-the BD is what this movie has been waiting for.
Sure-it's not an 8K scan restoration from a 65mm original....possibly a 4K scan from a beautiful 35mm orig. but I can't be sure about this.
But despite-it is superb....picture and audio are first class.
I am a true devotee of this movie - I know every scene-almost every frame.....and this BD is without doubt the best version ever of this classic and beautifully produced film.
When you watch it-don't despair at the opening credits....these have always (since the 70mm release) been awful grainy freeze frames of flowers...can't imagine why Jack L.W. ever let this happen...we'll never know I guess.
MFL was released in 1964...so 2014 will be the 50th Anniversary...maybe then we'll get the 8K scan this movie deserves. But for the time being, and for all these years we've had to endure the albeit superb dvd version-
this is the one to buy now.
Why a movie which won so many Oscars has not been given the treatment given to such benchmark BD's as
""How the West Was Won"" - ""Patton"" - ""Ben-Hur"".....I will never know....all about $$$ I guess.
BUT-the great hope for all of us out there who truly appreciate these (almost always) superb 1080 transfers on our 50inch Plasmas.....is the forthcoming 8K transfer of the supreme masterpiece of all time....

807900,1,630417893X,"My Fair Lady, both the stage and film versions, have played major roles in shaping my understandings of music, theatre, cinematography -- and even, linguistics. Over the past 20 years, I have owned this film on VHS (twice), laserdisc, DVD (twice), and now on Blu-ray. Knowing what I do about the current film elements held by CBS, this Blu-ray is a severe disappointment.

In the early 1990s, the original film elements were deteriorating in vaults; it was brittle, cracking, fading, and suffered from differential shrinkage. CBS paid a good sum in 1994 to save the film from being lost forever. Using digital technology to the best of their abilities, a new archival element was created -- preserving the film and allowing a new generation of viewers to see it in a condition not seen since the 1960s. At the same time, 35mm prints were created for LD, VHS, and later DVD transfers. Imperfections in the prints were not noticeable and yielded the best presentations in those formats due to their limited resolutions.

Now we come to the Blu-ray. I am not entirely sure if this transfer comes from one of the previous 35mm prints (the only tell-tale sign is the 2.35:1 aspect ratio). However, this print has major flaws that were not seen in the previous releases. First, and somewhat minor issue, the text in the title sequence has some distracting movement; this becomes less apparent if you are watching on a screen smaller than 32"".

The major problem has to do with an image distortion on the left and right sides of the image. Approximately 20% of the screen is affected. It is as if you were viewing the film with tunnel vision -- or watching a 2.5 hour dream sequence where the DP has ordered Vaseline to be spread along the sides of the lens. The edges of the picture is hazy and milky -- sometimes, it appears as an amber haze in scenes that are dimly lit. Unfortunately, this occurs throughout the film. Even funnier, the 1994 'Restoration' credits presented at the end of the film also has the muddy edges! It was digitally generated on a solid pink background -- there shouldn't be any change in color. Contrary to what I have read on many on-line reviews, this disc will not satisfy the 'typical' Blu-ray viewer. How many films have you seen where the image fades and loses color along the edges?

It is obvious that this disc was put together with little thought or consideration. The artwork on the cover is a rehash of a previous DVD release with more Photoshopping (flip the image along the vertical axis and add a pink-to-white gradient in the background); if the rights are available, it would have been better to use the original poster artwork. The art on the actual disc is generic -- a solid light blue with the title printed at the top. Possibly due to rights issues, only a few of the special features from previous formats are available on this disc.

I believe this was an attempt to capitalize on the holiday season, since My Fair Lady often receives air time in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I was extremely skeptical since its release was quickly and mysteriously announced this summer.

I have contacted CBS Home Entertainment about the image problem. So far, I have not heard back from them.",1322265600,124,3230,4.707964601769912
807901,2,630417893X,"I watched the BluRay last night on an OPTOMA DLP projector.  While it does look better than the DVD, it leaves A LOT to be desired.  First off, the film is at a 2:35:1 ratio, instead of 2.20:1, which is the correct aspect ratio for a movie shot on a 65mm negative/70mm printed format.  This leads me to believe that a 35mm source was used.  Second, AND BY FAR THE WORST, is the color shift from left to right in the WHOLE movie.  10% of the screen on the left and 10% on the right had different color density.  On my projector, the left had greenish tones, the 70-80% in the middle looked good, and the 10% on the right was pinkish.  During the night scenes, the pinkish on the right looked green, as if too much light was going through the film when it was projected.  This is completely unacceptable, especially for masterpiece!  Another thing I noticed is that jitter is noticeable during some scenes.  This also indicates that the transfer is not recent.  I would not be surprised if CBS used the exact same restoration, with no additional work, that was prepared for the 1994 laserdisc release.  The audio, while better than anything I have heard on home video, should also has been improved.  While there is a nice dynamic range, it still sound restrained, and there is a weird reverb added to the back speakers during musical numbers, as if this was an old Dolby ProLogic home theater effect that was kept.  After the movie is over, the closing credits are exactly the same as on the laserdisc box set, listing people who worked on the restoration with a 1994 copyright date.  When I bought the disc last weekend, the first thing that went through my mind when I picked up the packaging is that it looked like a bootleg.  So sad for such a distinguished movie!  Even though I had read the reviews, I bought it because it does look better than both the laserdisc and the DVD.  This is only because the bluray platform supports higher resolution, not because of work put into the film by CBS.  Oh well....maybe the rights will be transferred again and a more respectable studio will release it in the manner that ""Sound of Music"" was restored.",1322265600,30,2148,4.503875968992248
807902,5,630417893X,"The best transfer ever of the film on a video medium.
Please read Bluray.com's review below:
'My Fair Lady's extravagant sets and costumes often sparkle on Blu-ray. Colors are quite gorgeous and stand out as the transfer's best asset. From the opening shot of well-dressed socialites leaving the opera forward, the transfer yields sparkling hues, generally well-balanced and harmonious, looking as exquisitely natural as ever. Even the bright white social circle scenes and the very warm interior of Higgins' office offer stability and evenness. Black levels are strong throughout, even as dark suits and black carriages bump up against shadowy backgrounds at film's open. Fine detail is strong, but not perfect. Faces and clothes, of course mainstays of Blu-ray visual efficiency, look quite good, but so too do everything from Eliza's wicker flower basket to brick faades, wooden textures, and even dirt on the ground, all of which are presented with a natural, almost tactile appearance. Clarity is strong, but the image does appear to drift into softness and edge murkiness every now and again. It's also dotted by occasional speckles, but the print appears to be in otherwise fine shape. This isn't the snazziest looking catalogue title on Blu-ray, but Paramount's 1080p release is solid all around and should please longtime fans looking to enjoy the boost in resolution and stability the format offers.'

THIS PART IS MY REVIEW:
Cukor's `My Fair Lady' is not innovative or an example of where cinema would be headed at the time of its release. In a year of Kubrick's riveting `Dr. Strangelove' and Lester's creative `A Hard Day's Night', `My Fair Lady', is more like Hitchcock's masterpiece `Marnie' of the same year. These two latter films; are a testament of how well these two filmmakers understand the craft of filmmaking and the language of cinema. So why does `My Fair Lady' stand out as my personal best of the year? Because you could fill an arena full of directors from the beginning of cinema to present day and there would only be a handful, which project such talent and ease for this kind of material! Cukor's film is filled with wonderfully executed scenes, without the aid of extravagant sets and when he builds a large set of a race track, he does it with minimal means and only the camera and editing to give it the panache, it needs to succeed as a sequence. When directors were starting to lean on big, unusual sets as in `Dr. Strangelove' (which I love) or on modern day sensibilities and wild camera movements, as in `A Hard Day's Night' (which l also love), Cukor was proving, simplicity and style could make superb, intellectual entertainment! Therefore nineteen sixty-four's most original statement was `My Fair Lady'!",1322092800,4,2749,4.989106753812636

pixellaneous dissipation.

The late Jack Warner spent a great deal of money to produce this
masterpiece - too much, so he couldn't afford to secure the rights

having obtained these legal rights, one should have the appropriate

This is an extremely poor transfer of Warner's crown jewel.  IT IS SO SAD THAT THE RIGHTS BELONG TO CBS, WHO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF THIS GREAT FILM.

Twentieth Century Fox did a fantastic job with their Blu-ray edition of ""The Sound of Music"".  I was expecting ""My Fair Lady"" to look as good as ""The Sound of Music"".

I was foolish. The disc is a mess.

From the moment the credits begin to roll, it is apparent something is not right.  The gorgeous background flowers are grainy and in questionable focus, and there is indeed fog around the edge of the picture in the opening outdoor scenes.  Then the fog follows the action indoors and never leaves.

Every once in a while there is a scene without fog and in crystal clear resolution.  Those moments are dazzling, and it makes you realize what the film might have looked like.

The special features are informative and appreciated.  Regardless of what many say, I still feel that it was a tradgedy - a stupid decision - not to cast Julie Andrews at Elisa Doolittle. Audrey Hepburn does a fine job as Elisa, but the dubbed singing doesn't measure up to Julie's recordings. This Blu-ray DVD ""My Fair Lady"" is highly recommended.",1321574400,3,633,4.584070796460177

Once again more loverly than ever!

I have been waiting for this for a long time. I too am surprised at the lack of a more Special Edition
for the Blu-ray. I've had the super LaserDisc, and different DVD versions over the years.

I had to redo my review, as I've had a change of heart. I've been going back and forth
between my old DVD and this Blu-ray. Something is amiss on the outer edges at times,
and it seems more noticeable in darker scenes, but this is not always the case.
It's almost as if there was vaseline on the sides of the lens. The scenes towards the end
when Freddy takes Eliza back to ""where she belongs"" are very bad. There are many
more scenes with issues such as this, some as bad, and some not as much.

Be sure to visit the hometheaterforum for the comment by Robert Harris about this.
He was in charge of the original restoration back in 1994.

At times the picture looks beautiful, and will blow you away.
You really can notice the extra detail.
But other times, you feel, something's gotta be wrong.

It is possible that some of these defects were there, and just not as visible on DVD
due to the lower resolution. But some just have to be a mistake.

Hopefully a fix will be coming in the very near future. Until such time,

The case is the same as the cheapest BD's. As for the enclosed book, there was none.  There was no book, booklet, folder, leaflet, or even a Post-It that read ""Good Movie!"" written in crayon.

It is packaging worthy of the lowest price budget BD's.  But it is NOT packaging appropriate for the winner of several Oscars, including BEST PICTURE.

Examine the packaging for BD releases such as ""Doctor Zhivago,"" ""North by Northwest,"" or even ""The Big Lebowski.""

807947,1,630417893X,"OBITUARY:  On November 15,2011 Blu-Ray consumers bore witness to the still-born deliveries of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""West Side Story"".  It was a mournful day.  Clearly, the past promises of Blu-Ray and all that is was meant to be - mainly perfection - has been abandoned and reduced to a text-book marketing ploy for The Emperor's New Clothes and all the off-the-rack deceptions that come with it.  I don't believe for a moment that the corrections needed on the Blu-Ray release of ""West Side Story"" will ever be rectified by the distributor.  Their so-called variation on a recall of this faulty Blu-Ray transfer will prove to be nothing more than a placating or string-along PR scam; as such corrections, I suspect, could lead to a lengthy and indefinite time period.  Without resolution, a couple more years will pass and, I suspect, we will enevitably discover that our hands will be forced into the realm of triple-dipping to get what we were initially promised on Noverber 15th.  They got your money, folks...and we are stuck.  Don't get me wrong; I am well aware that some of our classic films are in trouble and may never be able to attain the perfection I am addressing; on the other hand, my criticisms of ""WEST SIDE STORY"" and ""MY FAIR LADY"" are justified.  BOTH films have received the red-carpet restoration treatment within their 70mm negatives; and the Blu-Ray movement has irreversably proven what was possible with such standard-bearer transfers as ""The Sound of Music""; so...all and all, it's much too late for the Blu-Ray movement to begin its retreat.  Such lost experiences include the Blu-Ray OMISSION of the newly discovered Oscar winning 6-Track sound design from the 70mm Roadshow version of ""WEST SIDE STORY""; which just further mutes and diminishes the joyous sounds one would hope to hear at a 50th Anniversary party.  The excuses made for the 6-track omission are weak and unacceptable...something to do with costs...but what could be more costly than the mass marketing of a Blu-Ray title that morally needs to be recalled due to its poor supervision and lack-luster transfer?  The same aforementioned morals charge must also by applied ten-fold to the Blu-Ray transfer of ""MY FAIR LADY""  I mainly mourn for the restoration team of Harris and Katz; who spent, I believe, up to two years of their efforts in bringing back to pristine life the 70mm negative; which had nearly become extinct.  One would think - with preservation and perfection in mind - that the 1994 Harris/Katz acheivement fused with the possibilites of Blu-Ray would have been a match made in heaven...but CBS/Fox/Paramount did not confer with this source restoration team; leaving each and everyone one of us at the Blu-Ray alter.  The ""MY FAIR LADY"" supplements contain a fantastic 1994 insight into what Harris and Katz were up against in saving the 70mm negative; ironically, though, we do not get to experience the optimum results of their efforts.  It's not the fault of Harris and Katz...they did their job.  I believe their goal was to preserve ""My Fair Lady"" for future generations; and, ironially, that next generation of supervisors did not take advantage of the gift that was passed down to them.  This weakened transfer of the restored 70mm print onto Blu-Ray was in the hands of an entirely different team.  What this Blu-Ray team did to this transfer was equal to Higgins charges to Eliza when first hearing her accent; [it was]""the cold bloody murder of the English tounge"". Blu-Ray promised to give us the optimum State-Of-The-Art experience in sight and sound...and I would like to experience ""My Fair Lady"" in all its Loverly breadth and detail.  The Blu-Ray transfer team of ""MY FAIR LADY"" did little for our Miss Dolittle.  Perhaps, as consumers, we should no longer participate or invest our monies in the Pre-Order Sales programs...as consumers we should simply wait until the Blu-Ray reviews are in.  Perhaps, with a boycotting of Blu-Ray Pre-Order Sales it will ensure that the standards of restoration and transfers onto Blu-Ray remain in check.",1321401600,30,4066,4.974889217134416
807948,1,630417893X,"They seem to think that all they have to do is say Blu-ray to sell a classic film for the 4th time.  First there was the VHS tape, then the Laser Disc, followed by the DVD (2 releases)and now comes THE Blu-ray.  However, this Blu-ray is DEFECTIVE!  While it's possible for any film transfer to have little problems once in a while, this problem runs through the entire film.  What's more disturbing is that they cared so little for what might just be, the BEST AMERICAN MUSICAL EVER MADE.  And if ""My Fair Lady"" isn't the best, then it's ""West Side Story"", but in either case, ""My Fair Lady"" deserved more respect then to pass off an old defective transfer to master this new Blu-ray release.  While there are a number of problems with this Blu-ray release, the worst of the problems run from beginning to end and affects about 20% of each side of the picture.  It appears as a loss of contrast when compared to the center of the screen.  In some parts of the film it appears to become even worse.  It would appear that regular DVD's look better than this new Blu-ray.

If accurate aspect ratios are important to you, this Blu-ray of what was originally a 70mm Super Panavision film, should have an aspect ratio of 2.20:1, if it had been transferred from a 65mm negative or 70mm print.  This Blu-ray disc is 2.35:1, indicating it was originally transferred from a 35mm print.  They might have gotten away with the 2.35:1 AR transfer, had it not been a poorly done defective low resolution transfer, having a little too much edge enhancement, which can be annoying at best.

Warner, was, at 17 million dollars, one of the most expensive films ever made at that time.

VHS as just TV with crappier resolution.

When Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe turned ""Pygmalion"" into a Broadway musical, not counting added songs they adhered closely to the previous film's script, with one exception. Instead of occurring at a luncheon at Mrs. Higgins' home, Eliza's first public unveiling is at the Ascot races, an amusing sequence where the accent of Miss Doolittle's small talk is upper class but the content pure street urchin.

George Cukor's motion picture is a close approximation of the Lerner & Loewe Tony-winning production that had 2717 performances between 3/15/56 and 9/29/62. Harrison, Holloway and Olive Reeves-Smith (as an uncredited Mrs. Hopkins) are the only original stage players to appear in this movie.

SYNOPSIS--
While taking notes on lower class accents in a market square, professor of phoenics Henry Higgins (Harrison) encounters and immediately bonds with Col. Hugh Pickering (Hyde-White), a man who's written a book on spoken Sanskrit. A friend tells flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) that Higgins is writing down everything she says, so she confronts him.

After reassuring the girl that he's not a cop, Higgins remarks to Pickering that if he wished to do so, within a few months he could teach this ""guttersnipe"" impeccable diction and pass her off as a lady at the highest level of society. He also tells Eliza that she'd be able to open her own flower shop if she spoke proper English. Pickering scoffs at Higgins' boasts and the two men wander off after the professor gives his pocket change to the perplexed flower girl.

Higgins has invited his new friend to stay at his Wimpole St. home. The next morning they're surprised to see that Eliza's come to visit, hoping to be taught to speak like a ""lay-dee."" Pickering bets Higgins that he can't do as he claimed the previous night and offers to pay all of Eliza's expenses. Higgins accepts the challenge and so the experiment begins.

808030,2,630417893X,"In Edwardian London, phonetics Professor Henry Higgins and his friend, Colonel Pickering, make a bet about whether Higgins can train Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower seller from the slums, in speech and manners so that she can be passed off as a duchess at an embassy ball.

I grew up listening to the Broadway cast album, and my father hummed ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" to the day he died. I wanted to get a better sense of this show, which obviously meant so much to an earlier generation. My first viewing of the film, which I know well is a beloved classic left me cold, so I watched a second time, figuring I could either change my mind or think more about why I felt so cold.

There are things I really enjoyed about this movie.

The first is Audrey Hepburn's performance as Eliza Doolittle. Yes, I am aware of the controversy over her being cast instead of Julie Andrews. Jack Warner was putting a fortune into this movie and wanted Hepburn, who had never made a flop, to star, rather than Andrews, who had never made a movie. Hepburn was nowhere near the singer Andrews was, but she was an accomplished film actress whose persona was well-suited to the part of Eliza. She conveys Eliza's emotions with skill and subtlety. The 1994 DVD contains tracks of Hepburn's singing so you can compare it to Marni Nixon's dubbed vocals. I prefer Hepburn myself, because the singing voice matches the speaking voice, and why a Cockney slum girl would have a trained multi-octave coloratura soprano is beyond me. I would have preferred it if they'd dropped ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" (really more a showcase for Andrews' voice rather than integral to the story) and re-worked the remaining songs to suit Hepburn's more limited but perfectly acceptable abilities.

The second was the production design. Cecil Beaton's sets and costumes, especially the surreal Ascot Gavotte, are fascinating in the restored 1994 DVD.

Now for what I didn't like:

The movie was so obviously filmed on a back lot and on sound stages. It would have been nice for them to at least shoot some exteriors on location.

Neither Rex Harrison (Professor Higgins) nor Stanley Holloway (Eliza's father) appear to have toned down their stage performances for the film. Their relentless mugging, probably perfectly fine for trying to reach the nosebleeds seats in live theater, is irritating on film.

The filmmakers took little advantage of the medium to ""open out"" the show. It has very much the static look of a filmed play. Director George Cukor's quiet camerawork does little to enliven things.

Andre Preven's orchestrations are quite saccharine.

Most of the musical numbers drag on far too long with endless choruses and repetitions. Many of the dialogue scenes drag too, or maybe I was just tired after the songs going on forever. Overall there is a bloated feeling, as is so often the case with musicals made when the format was starting to die out in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

There was little in the way of choreography. My personal taste runs to more emphasis on dance in musical films.

Other than ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly,"" the songs don't resonate for me, though I know that's not a common opinion.

It's such a well-known film that I'm glad I saw it for myself, but I wouldn't buy it to watch over and over.",1289779200,6,3301,4.710069444444445
808031,4,630417893X,"I remember seeing this when it premiered: a big theater in Hollywood; I think it was The Egyptian.  Sold out.  Haven't seen it since, until the other day, courtesy Netflix; funny feeling to have forgotten about half of it.  I liked it, but it was somewhat disappointing at times, especially if one is of a mind to consider it as belonging to the category of five-star productions.  It disappointed me a little back then, too, but now I think I can put my finger on why.

If one only is exposed to the soundtrack -- the Broadway soundtrack (as I was, since my mother played it all the time) -- one builds up a picture of the story that isn't borne out when one sees the whole thing.  The numbers run about 45 minutes and the non-number parts run to about two hours - the numbers are outnumbered -- and what's more, about all them have an upper feeling to them, even ones, such as ""Just You Wait"" that are, well, combative.  The rest of the drama is often rather sombre in tone, and marked by frequent conflict -- angry outbursts often - between Higgins and Eliza.  Well, it's drama, after all.

Drama, yes, theater drama, and the producers seemed often at pains to keep everything as theatrical as possible (perhaps the idea was lurking in the background that theater is superior to cinema (a false notion)).  For instance, they never went on location, and perhaps only one scene was shot outdoors, and that was at night.  The horse racing scene at Ascot is not going to make anyone forget the chariot race in Ben-Hur; couldn't they have gone to Ascot, or at least inserted some stock footage of a real race?  All the scenes which were supposedly outdoors in daylight were obviously really indoors on a sound stage, and consequently the lighting looked phony (as it always does in such scenes).  Details like that add up.  The problem is that once a story gets made into a movie, the movie has to stand on its own two legs as a movie, which means it has to have what Kurosawa calls ""Cinematic Beauty.""

To me, that means the movie has look good visually, move visually, and coordinate with the sound, especially the music.  This movie does all that, but it's a little below average, especially on the visual score.  There is an absence of a pleasing painterly composition within the frame (in contrast to what one sees in movies directed by Orson Welles, for instance); it often seemed as though they were blocking the scenes exactly as if it were a stage play, and then setting up the camera, and aiming it in the general direction of the action and hoping for the best.  I don't remember any music occurring outside the numbers, and instead, there was talking, basically at all times.  Even the look of the numbers is static.  In ""Wouldn't it be Loverly"" Eliza is sitting down for the first third of the number, and the camera isn't moving either.  Then she gets up and dances about, but the camera is so far away that the resulting motion in the image is rather subdued.  And there were only five or six cuts through the whole number.  So it's very static, especially compared to a music video, or even The Sound of Music.  So, if this story had been made into a ballet with average choreography, or an opera with average music, would anybody be seriously thinking of giving it five stars?

On the plus side there is Shaw's story, which is very strong: one might almost say mythic.  And there are the numbers, perhaps the best set of numbers in any musical: one classic after another.  The casting also is very good.  Audrey Hepburn and Marni Nixon do very well.  Rex Harrison, of course, owns the role of Higgins (without him they didn't have a movie).  I can only be wistful regarding the peculiar magic of the Broadway cast, since that was before my time.  It's certainly slick with regard to its so-called production values -- especially the wardrobe, which is often fabulous -- but that is mainly a matter of budget and technique, as opposed to artistry.

One other thing: the ending gnaws at me.  They didn't kiss.  Although that trick worked in The Apartment, here it seems a little too cute.  In El Cid Charlton Heston got to kiss Sophia Loren, and in Ship of Fools Lee Marvin (of all people) got to kiss Vivien Leigh (there are advantages to being an actor, it seems).  But this...needless to say, is not going to make the Cinema Paradiso highlight reel.

And it didn't deserve to win over Dr. Strangelove.",1288569600,2,4417,4.531565656565657

808251,5,630417893X,"This is Paramount's first chance to release MY FAIR LADY on DVD; following a lapse in the distribution/copyright formerly controlled by Warner Brothers.  No doubt they'll later include it in an Audrey Hepburn box-set with their other Hepburn titles (""Roman Holiday"", ""Funny Face"" and ""Sabrina"" among them).

MY FAIR LADY is a true cinema classic; one of the last major Hollywood musicals and the film which finally netted director George Cukor a belated Academy Award for 'Best Director'.  Based on the long-running Broadway musical and G.B. Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", the story follows the grooming of Cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady of refinement by linguistics professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison).  These two opposites could hardly be more different, until the day that Higgins admits he's ""grown accustomed to her face""...

With a star-studded supporting cast (Wilfred Hyde-White, Jeremy Brett, Gladys Cooper and Stanley Holloway chief among them) and the soaring score of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, MY FAIR LADY is the glittering jewel which capped off the era of the great Hollywood musicals.  Seldom again would audiences be treated to such a sumptuous spectacle on the screen.

Despite a huge critical backlash (concerning Julie Andrews not cementing her most acclaimed stage role on film), Audrey Hepburn gives a spirited performance as feisty Eliza.  She worked hard to get her limited singing voice into the necessary shape to meet the demands of the score, yet at the 11th hour was replaced by noted Hollywood ""ghost singer"" Marni Nixon.  Rex Harrison, having starred in both the Broadway and London productions of the show, was confident enough in his performance to sing his songs live (via a hidden microphone).  Stanley Holloway--another veteran of the stage show--also triumphantly reprises his role for the screen.

Warner's previous double-disc Special Edition release (using the 1997 restored print of the film) was quite definitive.  I can't imagine how Paramount is going to top that release--unless they perform a new remaster of the 1997 print.  Still, MY FAIR LADY is one of those movies which deserves to always be in circulation, constantly enjoyed and discovered by new audiences.  I can only hope a shiny new Blu-ray release is just around the corner...

808299,5,630417893X,"In honor of what would have been Audrey Hepburn's 80th birthday, I take the opportunity to review what is perhaps her best-known role, and if not her best-known, definitely one of her most exquisite.
 Replacing Broadway's Julie Andrews in the role of Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, Hepburn brings her own essence to the part, with her shrill bellowing when a wealthy concert patron accidentally knocks her flowers into the mud outside Covent Garden, and when she first encounters the two men, namely Professor Henry Higgins (the formidable Rex Harrison) and Colonel Hugh Pickering(Wilfrid Hyde-White), who will play a major role in reshaping her life.
 We follow our heroine through her interactions with her fellow lower class street sellers(As is well-known, Hepburn's singing voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon) and her dealings with her drunken, dustman father, Alfred (Stanley Holloway).
 Taking into serious consideration Professor Higgins' boast that he  could help her improve her speech, and consequently, her life's prospects,and pass her off as someone from the upper class, Eliza goes to Professor Higgins' home on Wimpole Street to take lessons from him. After expressions of skepticism from Pickering, who is now Higgins' houseguest, and some antagonism between Eliza and the Professor, Higgins agrees, although his new pupil recoils at certain aspects of life at a new socioeconomic level, refusing to allow the maids, led by chief housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce ( Mona Washbourne)to give her a bath.
 It takes some time for Eliza to develop an ear for differing speech patterns. Higgins responds to her difficulties with much insensitivity a lot of the time. The enmity towards her teacher grows, especially amid one revenge fantasy. But Pickering is sympathetic to her.
 At one point, Mr. Doolittle pays a visit to the Professor that will alter the course of his life as well.
 After several grueling sessions, there is finally a breakthrough, and Eliza goes to bed feeling elated.
 Higgins takes Eliza on her first assignment at Ascot, where he seeks the help of his mother (Gladys Cooper), and Eliza attracts the attention
 of young Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett). But Eliza reveals her common origins and the session ends badly.
 The smitten Freddy  waits outside Higgins' home for days, hoping to see Eliza, but she refuses to see anyone.
 Still, she is to go to the Embassy Ball where she will be passed off as Pickering's niece.
 In so doing, she absolutely dazzles, revealing no trace of her origins, and dancing with a prince. When Higgins' former pupil, Zoltan Karpathy (Theodore Bikel) wrongfully identifies Eliza as a fellow Hungarian, Higgins knows that Eliza's transformation is complete.
 Yet more strife arises when Eliza, who took all the blame for the disaster at Ascot, received absolutely no credit from either Higgins or Pickering for the triumph at the Embassy Ball. Once again, Higgins reacts with insensitivity to Eliza's feelings, and she flees Wimpole Street sometime during the night, encountering Freddy, a few former street acquaintances, her father, and ultimately a supportive  Mrs. Higgins along the way.
 But she has become too much a part of Higgins' and Pickerings' lives during that brief time for  either of them to let her go gracefully. Pickering is straightforward about this , while Higgins hides behind his pride. So what will the resolution be?
 Viewers will find it amid a Lerner and Lowe score, performances, and costumes that are as exquisite as any flowers Eliza Doolittle might have sold. Under George Cukor's direction, George Bernard Shaw's modernized  and musical version of ""Pygmalion"" still entrances 45 years after its release.

The movie itself is, of course, a classic, and deservedly so.  Only problem is that many lines/scenes/songs have become part of our culture, and you keep saying to yourself, ""Ah, that's where that came from!""  But that isn't the movie's fault.
The ""special"" extras are so-so.  If you're a film buff, you'll like them.

A trivia question to which I don't know the answer: Can anyone say whether or not any scenes were un-rescuable?  I would have sworn there was a scene where Eliza sits around at a tea with high-society ladies and shows off her ability to mimic the Cockneys, much to their amusement and her mortification.  This scene was logically necessary to get Eliza off the hook for her Ascot outburst, but it isn't in this edition of the movie.

My Fair Lady is overlong, with far too much attention paid to characters who don't merit it (Freddy being a great example) and simply pad the running length; at its core there's an enjoyable story with Eliza and Henry Higgins, but the film is too bloated and slow to make it a classic.",1232323200,,303,4.410714285714286

808413,2,630417893X,"Although My Fair Lady continues to please people, it does not please me at all.  I must say that I am in the minority.  I saw the film when it first came out, and just a few days ago screened it again.

I want to make it very clear that I love cinema and that I love film musicals.  I say this because I want to assure readers concerning my devotion to the film musical form.  My criticism is that My Fair Lady as a film just doesn't live up to what it could have been.  To me, it is a tragedy that so many lives and dollars were expended to make a film that seems to lacks enthusiasm, warmth, and musicianship.

I find the film version gorgeous to look-at, but that is about all.  The performances and the music interpretation I find to be lacking, even to the instrumentation.  The whole film seems like it is being played as if fulfilling a formula.  Even Rex Harrison seems rather uninterested at times.

And, I will honestly say, that despite all the beautiful costumes and the spectacle, most of the film dramatically is just plain boring.  For someone like myself who loves art films that can move very slowly, this is quite an indicator of how My Fair Lady tragically doesn't inspire or move me.

Last, not using Julie Andrews (who originated the Eliza role on Broadway) was criminal and was quite a scandal at the time of the film's being made.  Only Ms. Andrews could have brought some life to the Eliza role.  While Audrey Hepburn was a great actress, she was not so in this film -- her performance lacks.

Despite the tremendous propaganda from Warner Brothers at the time the film was being made, the product of all that effort falls tremendously flat.  I would suggest that instead of buying or renting the movie, customers should listen to the original cast recording of the original Broadway production.  The singing, the instrumentation, and the artistry are infinitely superior to what is shown in the film.

Julie Andrews has proven her tremendous talent and devotion to her musical and acting craft over the years.  I believe that she should receive Special Recognition from the film community.

An apology from Warner Brothers would also be good for the studio.  WB made a tremendous mistake both artistically and politically in not choosing Julie Andrews.  It is time that WB faces its cruelty to Ms. Andrews, its disrespect for moviegoers, and makes amends to Ms. Andrews as well as to us.

This film version is more complex, with more in-depth characterization, and is impeccably filmed with many imaginative and original touches. Audrey Hepburn was an attractive Liza, but her singing was done by Marnie Nixon, and her cockney speech at the very beginning of the movie was needlessly incomprehensible. It was a classic Hollywood mistake not to use Julie Andrews in the screen version.
 Harrison is brilliant as Henry Higgins, and the supporting cast is first-rate. The musical numbers are well-structured with a flair and zest which shows George Cukor's taste and sensibilities. The movie deservedly won eight Oscars.
 The widescreen, letter-box version I found annoying as I usually do. The movie's sumptuous sets seemed to lose out by this process.
 The movie is enlightening about the British class system which persists to this day. Higgin's mansion is artfully rendered, and the scenes in which the servants sing are captivating.
 This film captures the spirit, the style, and the genius of the musical and provides us with an archival record of the show.",1217721600,,1160,5.18716577540107

No fan of musicals should be without this dvd in their collection.

The dvd itself is also a treat as it has been restored pretty well.  Picture quality-wise it isn't perfect but it's still very good given the state of the severely deteriorated original master and is still a lot better than many other ""restored"" older films that I've seen.  Also widescreen format is the best way to view this film and this is the format in which it is presented here on this dvd.  There is a nice short making-of documentary included and the biggest plus of this dvd version is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  I've seen other films with this feature but they don't sound as good but it is clear here that a lot of effort went into vastly improving and getting the most out of the 5.1 format.

Excellent sound quality and very good picture quality make this dvd great value for money.  I wonder what other improvements we can expect from the upcoming Blu-ray version?  As far as standard dvd versions go though, this version is very, very good.

But the moment the score began I was hooked at this humerous, enchanting tale of an very unusual Cinderella and Fairy Godmother.  The music is perfect, suited to every emotion felt by every character, making for a bright, fun, and touching musical experience.  The setting is grand, even for the streets of London (though it is probably not a good thing to romanticize poverty) but in the guise of the theatre it works perfectly. The direction is different, slightly wild, and dare-I-say incredibly imaginative.  The very motions of the actors are brilliantly thought-out. The acting is spot on, especially by the great Audrey who rids herself of charm to play the most obnoxious street urchin you will ever meet.  Even as she rises through the process of becoming a proper lady she never quite loses that earthy charm.  It's a touching story full of vivid, wild characters and plenty of heart.  As for the second disk, the geek in me loved the features that added plenty of trivia to my first ""My Fair Lady"" experience.",1210377600,,1138,4.770408163265306
808501,4,630417893X,"The 50th Anniversary Blu-ray of ""My Fair Lady"" was actually delayed by one year because the restoration team wanted to be sure they got everything right. The wait was well worth it! The 2015 Blu-Ray release, in effect, replaces a shoddy Blu-Ray release from Paramount. (""My Fair Lady"" was released by Warner Brothers studio). To my knowledge, ""My Fair Lady"" is the only movie to receive two complete restorations, one in 1994 and one in 2015. The 2015 Blu-ray release is stunning. The opening scene, taking place in a rainy Covent Garden at night, is now much clearer; and the stereo sound is greatly improved.
  The story, of course, is based on ""Pygmalion"", George Bernard Shaw's witty and astringent satire of the British social class system. The perfect score by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederich Loewe never violates Shaw's play. The songs elevate the plot up to heavenly heights. As perfect as the Blu-Ray and the musical are overall, the audience is still likely to feel emotionally distanced from the story of haughty Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and his lower-class Cockney pupil Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn).
  The production, shot entirely on sound stages at Warner Brothers, never quite springs to life the way that two other big Broadway musical adaptations of the era shot mostly or partially on location (""West Side Story"", ""The Sound Of Music"") do. The film feels ""studio bound"" and lacks a certain amount of impetus. Rex Harrison won an Academy Award for re-creating his stage role but, in retrospect, the award seems undeserved. By the time of the ""Fair Lady"" film, Harrison had lost the acerbic edge and subtle humor he had in the Broadway and London productions. Now he was merely content to play Higgins as an extension of his own arrogant personality; and he takes arrogance to an uncomfortable extreme here. Harrison's performance is cold, curt and often cruel. Though more robust, Stanley Holloway, also from the Broadway and London stage productions, seems tired re-creating his role of dustman Alfred P. Doolittle.
  Audrey Hepburn was left to suffer the slings and arrows of the critics. Hepburn's casting in 1963 was quite controversial. Jack Warner refused to cast Julie Andrews, who received rave reviews as Eliza on stage. So Audrey, through no fault or campaigning of her own, sort of won the role by default. With the controversy long over, it is easy to see now that Audrey's performance is the main reason to watch the movie. Audrey's Eliza is vulnerable, sympathetic, and extremely charming. Audrey's performance is only impeded by the humiliation of having her musical numbers dubbed by Marni Nixon, a bright and serviceable soprano. Nixon's singing voice is a less than perfect match for Audrey's speaking voice. But the soprano singing was, unfortunately, well beyond the abilities of Audrey's expressive, but whispery and thin singing voice.
  ""Fair Lady"" won big at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for George Cukor. Cukor finally won the Oscar because he was so long overdue. Cukor's work on ""Fair Lady"" is professional and craftsmanlike. But ""Lady"" is not Cukor's masterpiece. That is the 1954 version of ""A Star Is Born"" with Judy Garland. Audrey Hepburn was unfairly snubbed by the Academy. Julie Andrews, who ironically won the Best Actress Oscar that year for her movie debut role as ""Mary Poppins"", had admiration and praise for Audrey Hepburn.
  Still, ""My Fair Lady"" film earns extra bonus points for being remarkably faithful to the original stage musical. Every scene and song is intact. One fun and funny scene is added. Eliza, still lower-class and Cockney, is frightened to take a bath and screams, ""It ain't right! It ain't decent!"" The Extra Features are all the same hold-overs from the 1994 release. I did not care for the packaging of the 2015 edition. The two Blu-Rays and one DVD do not stay in the disc trays and slip out too easily.",1209340800,,3924,4.977099236641221

Now, about this DVD edition (the first one): The restoration job is great. The quality of picture and sound is excellent. If you care about the soundtrack, the US edition has the right pitch. Most European movie releases do not use the right pitch. Dialogs and music (or songs) are played at a higher speed so they don't sound natural and the European DVD edition of 'My Fair Lady' is no exception. However, the US DVD edition maintains the correct sound and the audio part is exactly like on the movie soundtrack CD.",1208563200,,689,4.609756097560975
808503,5,630417893X,"I've noticed in reading the reviews already posted that most people want to debate the casting of the film, and that's fine. Others want to debate whether or not George Bernard Shaw would be angry at the ending (which he actually did pen for the 1930s version of Pygmalion.)
That's all fine.

But here is my honest opinion of the film, and it's romantic plotline. First of all, it's beautiful. The scenery, the costumes, and the music. But the ambiguity of the Higgins/Eliza ""sort of romance"" has always been one of my favorite things about this film. Why? Because the one thing good ol' George Bernard Shaw got right about this script (be it his original theatrical ending or the film ending) is that it shows us the different types of love between men and women. Not all love is eros and passionate. It is more subtle.

At the age of 10, I found this ending incredibly frustrating. Now as I approach my mid-twenties, I find it real and heartfelt. Perhaps, Higgins and Eliza remain platonic. Or, maybe Higgins and Eliza decide to marry? Maybe she does run off and marry Freddy. This sort of thing is best decided by the individual. But one thing is certain, they are most wonderfully in love, be it conventional or unconventional.

And that's just loverly.",1206316800,2,1257,4.653153153153153

808579,5,630417893X,"I saw this decades ago on the New York stage when it starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.  The latter was replaced by Audrey Hepburn, a non-singer because the producers thought Andrews was not well-known enough to the general public.  What nonsense.  She was magnificent in the play and went on to become a great star without this cinematic vehicle.

Not to say that Hepburn is bad.  She is truly beautiful.  She could act, although her cockney feels rather forced.  The dresses she wears are gorgeous, as good as I've ever seen in the movies.  Unfortunately, she doesn't sing well enough to be permitted to sing--in a role that requires a singer.  So Hollywood dubbed in another singer and did it rather poorly, which is a surprise.  Frequently Hepburn's mouthing of the lyrics are not quite in sync with the dubber.  It's hard to imagine why the producers went to such lenghths on wardrobe and set, and then did such a poor job on the dubbing.

Other that that one flaw, this is a beautiful piece of work.  In a movie it is possible to go far beyond the narrows of a small theater stage, to a racetrack, to a very grand ballroom, etc.  Henry Higgins dwelling is almost a character in itself.  And Harrison is perfect in the role, as he was on stage, right down to his demand for his slippers in the final line.  In fact, all the characters are fine.

This is certainly one of the better musicals ever filmed in Hollywood, up there with Chicago, South Pacific, Gigi...  But I can't help but wonder what it would have been with Julie Andrews--or with Hepburn if she had been a singer.",1199145600,,1587,4.508771929824562

Now to the script: Professor Higgins makes a bet with a friend that he can transform the street beggar Eliza Doolittle into a socially graceful and desirable woman within six months. He takes her into his home and teaches her the proper way to speak the English language and to dress.

In the process, she (for some strange reason) falls in love with Professor Higgins, even though he is totally lacking in knowing how to treat women. He doesn't think he needs women and wonders why they can't be more like men (duh!!!!!).

Some of the songs are memorable and tremendous, with catchy choruses such as Wouldn't it Be Loverly, The Rain in Spain, Get Me to the Church on Time, and (my favorite) With a Little Bit of Luck.

Pygmalion is a play about a phonetician called professor Higgins and a linguist of Indian dialects called Colonel Pickering who make a bet that in a couple of months they can make a flower girl with a cockney accent, learn to be well-mannered and to speak as a duchess. With Higgins's overconfident attitude and Colonel Pickering's patience, they manage to transform the poor flower girl, Eliza, into a sophisticated lady.
The film has a different arrangement of scenes and dialogue lines from the original play ""Pygmalion"", but it catches the viewers interest by having a musical full of elegant costumes, humoristic lines and most importantly memorable and catchy songs played by a wonderful cast. This cast included Audrey Hepburn, who didn't really look like a low class flower girl in the beginning but appeared spectacular after the transition into a duchess. Her fine acting made the character come to life, brought spark to the play and provoked laughter to the audience quite a number of times. No one could have interpreted the new Eliza as charming, stylish and beautifully as Hepburn.  Rex Harrison also does a fine job at playing his arrogant character, Professor Higgins. Higgins always treated Eliza with a terrible attitude but as the movie develops, the viewer catches the spark of love that always existed between Eliza and Higgins. This relationship makes it a romantic musical and makes the film distinct from the original Pygmalion. In ""Pygmalion"", Eliza marries Freddy, but in ""My Fair Lady"" the producers decided that Eliza comes back to Higgins to live as a couple happily ever after. This was a typical move for the producers since most audiences prefer happy endings.
To sum up, ""My Fair Lady"", is a must-see classical for musical lovers. Songs like 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely?',  'Why Can't the English Learn to Speak' and ""The Rain in Spain"", make the film come to live, and allow the characters to express themselves and develop in a particular and creative way instead of just having plain, old dialogues. The actors were fantastic, and had a lot of chemistry with each other, especially Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn. The film could appear somewhat slow and dull for some people since it is old, but if you appreciate musicals and humor this is the movie for you.",1190160000,2,2597,4.926940639269406
808683,4,630417893X,"While Pygmalion, with Wendy Hiller, follows G.B. Shaw's play more concisely My Fair Lady deviates a bit from the play however it still captures more the audience. Though, a 1964 movie may seem a bit boring for 2007 it has that special essence that makes it a great classical. My Fair Lady is in the form of a musical, which may seem annoying to those who do not enjoy constant singing. In my opinion, the singing was a perfect element in the movie especially the chorus which sang according the Professor Higgins feelings. In the movie the workers gather around Professor Higgins and sing according to the current situation. For example, while training Eliza the chorus would repeat ""Poor Professor Higgins...Poor Professor Higgins"", I think this added a humorous element. Some of the songs are very catchy like ""The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plains"". I found these songs very entertaining while watching the movie.
Audrey Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza Doolittle may not seem like the ""flower girl"" that Shaw describes because she has that ""spark"" that makes her seem elegant even if she is in rags. When Hepburn is shown in the ambassador's ball, she illustrates a real sophisticated duchess. From the way her lips move (making sure she doesn't mess up her words) to the way she is dressed, Hepburn portrays the elegance in every lady. Unlike Hiller, in Pygmalion, Hepburn shines in the ballroom. One could say that Hepburn is the epitome of elegance and sophistication in this scene. There is also an alteration in this scene from Shaw's play. First the character of Neppomuck is changed into Zoltan Zarpathy and we are presented to the Prince of Transylvania who wishes to dance with Eliza. This never happens in Pygmalion; however this was added into the plot in order to make the story more interesting and intriguing.
The other characters also play an important role. In my opinion, Professor Higgins seemed less rude in My Fair Lady. This could have been due to the constant singing. At the end of the movie Eliza goes back to Higgins instead of marrying Freddy, this is a huge change in the real Pygmalion. The director chose this path in order to give My Fair Lady a happy ending, instead of following the real storyline and maybe disappointing the audience.
Overall, My Fair Lady is an entertaining musical which can take you back in time however the audience is able to feel the essence of a classical movie. Hepburn's character in the movie truly captivates the audience.",1189987200,2,2490,4.820093457943925

808689,3,630417893X,"Loved the lipstick; hated the pig.

""My Fair Lady"" is an elaborate wedding cake; it offers all the rewards and punishments of that overblown confection. The opening credits alone stuff you till you can't move: under white titles, lush, buttercream peonies, daisies and carnations lounge as if they were odalisques in a harem. You just want to bury your face in their petals and drown in scent.

And then, after he's proved he can wow you with white alone, Academy Award winning director George Cukor pops your eyes: a magenta gown and exotic, feathered headdress bedeck a woman descending a stair. She and the vintage luxury car she enters, before driving out of the movie forever, are onscreen for mere seconds.

No top hat is without its luster; no cobblestone lane without the dawn- or dusk- echoing heelstrike of a lovelorn swain.

The elaborate gold wallpaper in Higgins' home writhes like some Edwardian opium eater's hallucination. This is juxtaposed with grey housekeeper Mrs. Pearce's (Mona Washbourne) bosomy officiousness. The Ascot scene juxtaposes hysterical lyrics -- ""Pulses rushing! Faces flushing! Heartbeats speed up! I have never been so keyed up!"" with the funniest parody of British stiff upper lips. And the Transylvanian Queen is played by a real Baroness, Bina Rothschild.

The songs exemplify the best of Broadway: ""Wouldn't it be Loverly?"" ""The Street Where You Live,"" ""I Could have Danced All Night,"" ""The Rain in Spain,"" ""I've grown Accustomed to Her Face.""

Audrey Hepburn is as close to a fairy princess as any star who's graced us. She is beautiful and she's got soul and intelligence to burn. The attention she brings to one small scene -- she asks Freddy's mother to compensate her for Freddy's having trod on her violets -- her body performs a little ballet; her face broadcasts exactly who Eliza Doolittle is -- a girl of poverty, decency, ambition, and wit -- set the screen a-sparkle.

""Sexy Rexy"" earned his nickname by running through women like I run through kitchen sponges; there were two suicides. Harrison *is* Higgins (In the same way that he was also Captain Gregg, King Mongkut,  Julius Cesar and Pope Julius. He really owned these roles.) Harrison is entirely believable, even though his performance is stagey, larger than life, and his dialogue frequently over-the-top.

""My Fair Lady"" was based on George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion,"" which took its title from a sublime Greek myth. Sculptor, and misogynist, Pygmalion sees no need for a woman in his life. Perhaps thanks to unconscious motivation, he carves a woman: Galatea. Over time, the proud bachelor metamorphosizes into a humble supplicant. Please, he begs of love goddess Aphrodite, grant me this one boon: allow my Galatea to come to life; allow me to love her. Just as his hard arrogance melts, and he resurrects to a new life of love, Galatea's marble melts, and she lives to love her Pygmalion.

Shaw appropriated the title, but he violated the myth, perhaps in self-exculpation. Shaw was excessively attached to his mother; he never had sex with his wife, and he threatened his mistresses. Shaw didn't allow *his* creation, Higgins, to overcome his problem with women, to experience on the page or the stage what eluded arrogant Shaw in life.

One definition of ""main character"": it's the character who changes. The title of this myth is ""Pygmalion,"" the name of the sculptor. It's *his* journey that has made this tale poignant to two plus millennia of fans. Where there is life, there is change. Death rejects change. Shaw's Pygmalion, Higgins, may as well be dead.

It is a convention of Romantic movies that the lead couple ""meet cute."" They do, in ""My Fair Lady."" Language scholar Henry Higgins is about to travel to India to meet scholar Colonel Pickering, and Colonel Pickering is traveling to India to meet Higgins. In London, they have a star-crossed meeting.

Higgins' eyes twinkle when he looks at Pickering. He is endlessly affectionate to, appreciative of, and polite with Colonel Pickering.

Eliza? Higgins treats her, from start to finish, with utter contempt, and more than a little softcore S&M. He denies her food. He shoves marbles into her mouth and forces her to attempt to recite. She struggles; she can't; she swallows a marble. Higgins shoves more in her. Ha, ha, ha. There are websites that cater to this sort of kink. Higgins, in a very grim scene, calls Eliza an ""insect,"" a ""creature."" By the end of the movie, when Eliza is in Higgins' presence, she keeps silent till spoken to, and looks at the floor. And he looks, not only old enough to be her father, but perhaps her grandfather.

When Eliza makes her two breakthroughs -- the ""Rain in Spain"" scene and the ""Embassy ball"" scene, Higgins doesn't so much as look at Eliza; he celebrates passionately with -- Pickering. Higgins doesn't say, ""I think *you've* got it"" to Eliza, he says, ""I think *she's* got it"" to Pickering. After the ""Spain"" scene, Higgins interrupts his arm-in-arm ascent of the stairs, to bed, with Pickering, to playact dressing Pickering up in a gown; later he says that Eliza's Ascot gown doesn't fit because he and Pickering bought it together, without Eliza.

Harrison and Hepburn have zero chemistry; even in still photos. Harrison looks overcome with contempt and distaste; she looks terrified.

Sure, Higgins admits, ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face."" Of course. Eliza knows where his slippers are. In the end, the writing is so phony and transparent you want to FedEx Shaw to the National Organization of Women. Eliza accepts an unchanged relationship with an unchanged Higgins. Uh, huh. We believe that. Not.

Imagine how fine this film could have been had we had a scene where we see Higgins undergo the change that rocked Pygmalion's world, and some of our own, as well, when we finally found love.",1184025600,6,5824,4.937627811860941
808690,5,630417893X,"I had not watched this marvelous movie for many years when I took the opportunity to watch it again.  The movie is a little stiff in places, but that stiffness seemed, to me, to enhance the formality of English high society.  Audrey Hepburn belies that stiffness with her free-spirited characterization of Eliza Doolittle.  Eliza contrasts nicely with Henry Higgin's mother, played by veteran actor Gladys Cooper (""The Happiest Millionaire,"" ""The Song of Bernadette,"" and ""The List of Adrian Messenger"").  Mrs. Higgins is quite proper and perfect in every situation.  Henry, played by the incomparable Sir Rex Harrison, is disdainful and aloof.  Henry believes he is the remote scientific observer who can categorize and stereotype everyone, and is not affected by his surroundings.

A problem arises when Henry Higgins bets Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White, ""Ten Little Indians"" (1965) and ""In Search of the Castaways"") that he could take anyone, such as Eliza Doolittle, and turn them into something like a lady's maid or a shop girl.  Colonel Pickering takes Henry up on his bet, volunteering to finance the experiment.

Looking at the next part of this movie with five decades of life, I quickly saw the problem that Henry was getting into.  Henry was taking a human life adjusted to a certain set of surroundings, modifying that life so that it no longer fit in, and was then prepared to cast that life adrift once he proved his point.  Henry failed to see that he did anything wrong, and therein lies the irony and pathos of this movie.  The question a first-time watcher asks is whether Henry will be able to grow up at last and realize that people require compassion and empathy and are more than science experiments.

In addition to a marvelous story, this movie boasts wonderful music and excellent sets.  Though some of Audrey Hepburn's singing survived, Marni Nixon sang most of the music attributed to Hepburn.  Nixon's singing was phenomenal and her singing voice is close enough to Hepburn's that it sounds as though Hepburn could be singing.

Other singing numbers contained extensive choreography on expansive sets.  Two complexly choreographed songs that come to mind are ""Get Me to the Church on Time"" and the ""Ascot Gavotte.""

This movie featured an array of sets depicting street scenes and interior scenes.  Though the street scenes were excellent, my favorite set in the movie has always been Henry Higgin's incredible library.  I would love to have his library in my house, though duplicating that library would be incredibly expensive.

This movie won 20 awards, which includes eight Oscars.  Rex Harrison won the Best Actor Oscar and the movie won the Best Picture Oscar, both highly coveted awards.  Harrison won many other awards for this film, and ""My Fair Lady"" became the most awarded movie of 1965.

Of course, awards do not necessarily mean a film is either good or great.  However, Rex Harrison, Audrey Hepburn and Wilfrid Hyde-White have such incredible acting skills and such screen presence that they make this film a joy to watch.  I was spell-bound as I watched Audrey Hepburn become Eliza Doolittle and capture the hearts of everyone in the movie.  Rex Harrison was incredible as Henry Higgins.  This movie was either Harrison's best, or one of his best.

The story is also captivating.  Henry Higgins experiments with the life of a human being.  What Henry Higgins failed to realize is that once he became involved with his subject, he lost his objectivity and learned compassion.  Love can come from compassion.  The only thing that surprised me in this viewing of the movie is that I previously had not realized how early in the movie that Eliza Doolittle had come to love Henry Higgins.

""My Fair Lady"" is one of the best musicals of all time.  The combination of story, acting, singing and sets is amazing.  Fans of musicals and love stories will enjoy this movie, even on multiple viewings.

It's got music that makes you want to dance all night, and it's got an actress who possessed class, style and the kind of beauty and charm that would never be reincarnated after she was gone.

I have a friend. We almost never agree upon any movie - anything I like he would usually stamp as ""rubbish"". There is not too much to reply to this argument but when we both watch the ""Opening Alcott Race"" scene in ""My Fair Lady"" with its harmony in white-black-gray (and who knew that color gray has so many shades and nuances), and then the harmony gets slightly distorted by Henry Higgins's brown suit and then as apotheosis, Eliza appears in an incredible black/white dress with a tiny red bow which completes this harmony, this feast of colors (and there are only five of them but you would think there are myriads) and that little bow is a last stroke, the stroke of a visual genius and that is magic...Every time during this scene I see the tears on my cynic-friend's eyes and I know that we both witnessed incredible moment created by the power of the human imagination.",1170115200,5,1632,4.47986577181208
808795,5,630417893X,"Audrey Hepburn is radiant and touching as the poor flower seller Eliza Doolittle who challenges her mentor's makeover powers, before eventually passing for a lady in London society... She is skillfully transformed into an elegant lady by a speech professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and taught to speak properly... From first frame to last, the film is slick, graceful, gorgeous to behold, with costumes and sets richly evoking the Edwardian era...

'My Fair Lady' begins in London, on a rainy evening outside Covent Garden, where a 'respectable girl' is selling bouquets of violets... Professor Henry Higgins, a phonetics and linguistics expert, confronts the 'deliciously low so horribly dirty' Eliza Doolittle for the first time...

In the best tradition, their first songs reveal their characters: 'Wouldn't It Be Loverly?' expresses Eliza's own ideas of what she dreams, while in 'Why Can't the English Learn to Speak' Higgins sings his despair over the deterioration of the English language, and displays his hard, irritable, intolerant, and elegantly arrogant nature...

Lerner and Loewe's songs are shear delight as the story moves from Higgins's wager with sympathetic Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he can change the street girl with a strong cockney accent into a different human being by teaching her 'to speak beautifully' and pass her off in an upper class lady within six months... Higgins and Pickering are both single men, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce, has misgivings about the way in which they are proposing to amuse themselves without caring about the consequences for the ""common ignorant girl.""

The songs are extraordinary in their ability to enrich our knowledge of the characters... Higgins' early song 'I'm an Ordinary Man' confirms that he is a 'quiet living man' without the need for a woman... Alfred Doolittle's 'With a Little Bit of Luck ' not only states his general philosophy of life, but exposes the perfect portrait of a friendly scoundrel... Eliza's father, who calls himself one of ""the undeserving poor"" is one of Shaw's best comedy creations... When he arrives to protest at the immorality of Higgins and Pickering treatment of his daughter, it soon becomes clear that he just wants to gain something for himself out of the situation... Eliza, becoming subject to Higgins' intimidation, belts out her discomfort at the rude, selfish Higgins, imagining a king ordering his death, in ""Just You Wait, 'Enry 'Iggins.""

The music is also a logical extension of the characters' feelings... When Eliza finally pronounces impeccably: 'The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,' Higgins can hardly believe what he has heard: ('By George, she's got it. Now once again, where does it rain?'), and Eliza ('On the plain! On the plain!') and Higgins simply cannot be contained ('And where's that soggy plain? ') Eliza responding: In Spain! In Spain! They sing a duet together to celebrate their success... The scene leads to one of the most triumphant sequences in musical history...

Further, the stunning scene in which Eliza Doolittle appears in high society when she meets Higgins's mother (the impeccable Gladys Cooper), and attends the Ascot races... She instantly charms a young admirer Jeremy Brett (Freddy) by her slightly odd manner of speaking, who later haunts Higgins' house (""On the Street Where you Live"").

The climax comes at the Embassy Ball, where Higgins' protg, now ""an enchanting young lady"" charms everyone with her beauty... Her exercise is an unqualified success... Her waltz with the Queen's son, and other dance partners, spreads throughout the audience about her identity...

Henry and Pickering are ecstatic... They congratulate each other for their ""glorious victory,"" ('You Did It'), but Eliza is hurt and angry at being ignored... They barely acknowledge her presence... She is no longer a part of any world... When Higgins returns for his slippers, which he has forgotten, Eliza flings them angrily at him, and voices her feelings: 'Oh, what's to become of me? What am I fit for?'

In an attempt to find her true identity a frustrated Eliza encounters Freddy who declares his love for her, but she returns to the populated flower market outside Covent Garden, where no one recognizes her... Her own 'miserable' father - tuxedo-dressed - gives her the cheerful news that he is about to get married...

In the closing scenes, Higgins is upset to discover Liza has left him and is led to wonder why 'can't a woman be more like a man? Men are so honest, so thoroughly square.' Eliza surprises Higgings with her decision to marry Freddie, and claims: 'I shall not feel alone without you. I can stand on my own without you. I can do bloody well 'Without you!'

At his home, at dusk, Higgins ultimately recognizes Liza's quality... He recalls Liza and realizes how much she has come to mean to him... Without her, he is lost and lonely...

The climax is a great ending to a great musical...

'My Fair Lady' has great style and beauty... The film describes what is common in many societies... That accent determines the superficiality of class distinctions... The motion picture is humorous, notably the wonderfully steamy bath in which Prof. Higgens' female staff cleanses the accumulated dirt of the street off Eliza Doolittle...

With the dazzling splendor that director George Cukor offers: the designer's eye for detail, the painter's flair for color, the artist's imagination, and the delicacy of handling, the film garnered no less than twelve Oscar nominations, and took home eight statuettes including Best Picture of the year, Best Actor- Harrison, Best Director- Cukor, as well as Best Art Decoration, Sound, Scoring, Costume Design, and color Cinematography...",1168214400,3,5746,5.151287553648069
808796,5,630417893X,"From the cast to the music, from the sets to the costumes, from the atmosphere to the script, My Fair Lady remains one of the most beautiful and succesful musicals ever that has been brought to the big screen. It is an enjoyment for both eye and ear and stil keeps audiences humming the songs long after they have seen the film.

Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, who play the main characters in the film, both act deliciously and are both a joy to look at. Hepburn is truely lovely as the commen flowergirl Eliza Doolittle, who is found by professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harisson) on the streets of London. Higgins takes on a bet with an old friend, colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), that he can transform Eliza from a streetlike flowergirl to a wonderful speaking Dutchess. But this proves to be harder than it looks.
Hepburn's performance is one of a kind. She gives the character of Doolittle a heart and a soul like no other actress could have done.
And even though Rex Harrison's character Henry Higgins isn't always likable in what he says, he is terribly funny and the way he uses his voice is absolutely fantastic.

The film may feel a bit dated to the younger generations, it remains a true masterpiece that still makes the hearts of many beat faster. The songs are marvellously written and remain in your head for a long time. The costumes are beautiful and the sets are also. You can really see that months and months have been put into the production of the film. Every little detail is taken care of.
This version that is seen on the dvd shows a restored edition of the film. The film was beginning to become lost, the filmroles were getting older and started to fall apart. But thanks to fantastic professionels, the film has been beautifully restored and gives the film back the colorful and fresh look it should have. The audio has also been restored which brings the songs and music in their fullest and most beautiful form. A fascinating documentary shows what happened and how the film was restored. It also shows a great welth of footage behind the scenes of the film, how it was made and produced back in 1963. This together with the film makes this dvd a true treasure to have and to hold in your dvd collection.

So with legendary performances by legendary actors, with beautiful art-direction that pleases your eyes, and music that your ears will fall in love with, My Fair Lady is one of a kind and has been that way many years. And it is safe to say that it remains that way for many years to come.

I spoke to an elderly British expat and he told me that it was quite an accurate portrayal of life in British Edwardian society. Furthermore, he related to me that the film did a great job of conveying what it was like to be poor, cockney and working class in London at that time. In addition, much of the film's cast either lived during or shortly after the film's historical setting. One of the actors, Stanley Holloway, actually served in the Britian's military during World War I when the country was the British Empire. There's probably never been a remake of the film on the big screen because no one one other than the actors who were in that film could pull it off.

808872,5,630417893X,"March 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the opening on Broadway of Lerner and Loew's My Fair Lady.  I was priveleged to see the original starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.  Fifty years later we are still humming the songs from this beautiful play.  In the mid-1960s Audrey Hepburn brought Eliza Doolittle to the silver screen.  I thought no one could replace Julie Andrews as Eliza.  I must admit that I was very much mistaken.  Despite the fact that it's not Audrey singing, she took to the role of Eliza as if it was especially created for her and gave a magnificent performance. Sadly, Audrey was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1965. The My Fair Lady DVD of the movie version is of high quality and is a wonderful way to preserve this classic film.  I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.",1143244800,8,821,4.506756756756757
808873,5,630417893X,"Fifty years ago this week, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's incomparable MY FAIR LADY opened on Broadway-and ran for several years.  When producer Jack L. Warner personally produced a movie version, he did almost everything right-the whole show at 173 minutes (including roadshow intermission and music ends), in proscenium arch Super Panavision 70, with Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway repeating their stage roles.  And he brought in a director he had worked with before (A STAR IS BORN in 1954) and who was renowned for elegant sophistication, George Cukor.  But Warner may have made a big mistake in not casting the Broadway Eliza Doolittle, Julie Andrews, for the movie, going instead with young Audrey Hepburn.  Revenge was both bitter and sweet-the movie got twelve Oscar nominations but none for Hepburn as Actress, while Andrews (in her film debut) won the Actress Oscar...for MARY POPPINS.  Adding insult to insult, Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon in one of the worst-kept secrets in 1963 Hollywood as the movie was being filmed at Warner Bros.  And Jeremy Brett's towering ""On the Street Where You Live"", one of the greatest songs in musical theater history, was also dubbed--in a very well kept secret, not revealed until a 1994 documentary.  Now why, pray tell, does one cast actors in a musical whose song voices will have to be dubbed?  Actually, Hepburn and Brett are wonderful as Eliza and Freddy in the movie.  And Andrews has her Oscar as ample compensation.  Maybe she would have won an Oscar for MY FAIR LADY.  We will never know.

I am reviewing the 40th anniversary restoration of MY FAIR LADY on letterboxed double disk DVD.  The box says ""High definition transfer from the 1994 restoration picture and sound elements.""  Even with just stereo headphones and a 27"" television in a bedroom, the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has.  The loverly songs seem to jump out at you, and the color is magnificent.  This was a mammoth restoration job by the great team of Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, who initially had to deal with a negative that looked like crumpled and cracked bacon with no color left.  The preservation job they have done, documented on the lengthy and extensive 1994 documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett on disk two, deserves a Special Oscar.

Man, I love this movie!  I could watch it again tonight for four hours (including bonus material), just for the glorious songs and the witty story--Rex Harrison and Wilfred Hyde-White, Henry Higgins and Colonel Pickering, are phonetic experts who hire a young cockney flower girl, Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, to pose as a duchess.  That involves tons of dictation and phonics lessons.  Much of the dialogue is clearly taken directly from George Bernard Shaw's PYGMALION, filmed in 1938 with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.  Interestingly, both of these movies, three decades apart, where photographed by Harry Stradling.  As Eliza slowly becomes someone elegant and smart, we get some of the most beautiful songs in the American musical theatre, including  ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"" ""I'm an Ordinary Man,"" ""The Rain in Spain,"" and especially the soaring ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", my personal favorite song in the whole show.  Meanwhile, back in Covent Garden, Eliza's father Alfie (Oscar nominee Stanley Holloway) tears up the wide screen with ""A Little Bit of Luck"". The renovated and regally dressed new Eliza is a hit at the Ascot races, until something very funny happens.

Jeremy Brett, or a song double, gets to do my other favorite song in the show, ""On the Street Where You Live"", on both sides of the theatrical intermission and Embassy Waltz.  Let's talk about Oscar-winning sets by Gene Allen and costumes by Cecil Beaton (who egotistically once tried to take credit for the sets also).  We spend a lot of time in a Wimple Street flat with a lot of book shelves and ladders from floor to two story ceiling.  Cukor (or choreographer Hermes Pan) seems to know where to put three or five people at one time to make a static setting interesting.  The Ascot races are all white and black and gray, very elegant and striking; Beaton's costumes are magnificent.  And Allen's designs for Higgins' mother's (Gladys Cooper) apartment are so stylish--all white, with plants upstage, Eliza in a pink dress, and Higgins in a gray suit.

Part two of MY FAIR LADY is only about 75 minutes, but manages to have reprises of ""Just You Wait"", ""On the Street Where You Live,"" ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" in a pre-dawn Covent Garden, the new ""Show Me"" by Eliza/Marni Nixon, and Holloway's show-stopping ""Get Me to the Church on Time"".  We end with Eliza choosing Higgins over Freddy (watch for key dialogue in mom's apartment with Higgins and Eliza revealing honest feelings) and Higgins' poignant soliloquy ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"" on the same Wimpole Street set where Freddy does ""On the Street Where You Live"".  It is a satisfying ending to a fabulous show, filmed to perfection by an army of pros on both sides of the camera.

And do spend some time with the disk two bonuses on the letterboxed 2004 double disk. My only complaint is that the informative 1994 documentary has the movie clips in squeezed or pan/scan format and not wide-screen.  It is a bit ludicrous to have restorers Harris and Katz talk about ""restoring a lady"" if we cannot see that ""lady"" in her Super Panavision glory.  But that's a minor flaw in a very good documentary.  It is chilling to think we almost lost MY FAIR LADY to the ravages of time.  Fortunately, the movie itself is at the correct 2.20 wide-screen ratio, so watch this hour documentary before viewing the incomparable restored film.  You may even want to put on the English subtitles command so that you can sing along to some of the loveliest songs ever.",1142553600,11,5830,4.843592330978809

To my mind, Julie IS a LADY and would never convince as a flower girl transformed to a lady.... Even her wonderful voice lets her down in that respect. Lately Julie said she only in later years regretted and was saddened not been able to play that part - but she got MARY POPPINS....

MY FAIR LADY nevertheless is a classic and deservedly so.",1139875200,,640,4.508620689655173
808877,5,630417893X,"Yes, I know, Audrey Hepburn couldn't sing the songs and had to have someone else sing for her, while Julie Andrews could have done the singing herself. I know all that. However, I think Audrey Hepburn and Marni Nixon did a fine job acting and singing as Eliza Doolittle. Audrey is my favorite actress of all time, so I'm a bit biased, but I'm also a huge fan of Julie and I know she would have done this role brilliantly. However, she went on to do Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, and honestly, I can't see anyone else as Mary or Maria. Just wanted to get all that out of the way, as many can't get past the fact that Julie wasn't in the movie.

That having been said, I discovered My Fair Lady in the mid-90's, after a team of experts lovingly restored the film to its original Super Panavision 70 splendor, although for years, I still only saw the pan-and-scan version. However, I instantly fell in love with the songs, the designs, and the lovely Ms. Hepburn.

This DVD is absolutely one of the crown jewels of my collection. The transfer is excellent, although I hear it starts to break down on large screen TVs, HDTVs, and projection screens. However, I just have a regular TV, and on my TV, it's an excellent transfer. The colors are vibrant, the designs are brilliant, the scope of the Super Panavision 70 fills my eyes with visual beauty. There are a few print flaws which are present because of the inability to perfectly fix them in 1994, but nothing very distracting. The audio is also excellent. The first disc's sole bonus feature is an audio commentary by production designer Gene Allen, Marni Nixon, and restorers Robert Harris and James Katz. I found the commentary to be a bit boring, and focused more on the restoration than anything else. All in all, the movie is the showpiece of disc 1. Although many can argue that it could use a new digital restoration by companies such as Lowry Digital, responsible for many of the restorations of Disney films for DVD, to bring it to the standard of movies restored in the 21st century, I think the 1994 restoration still holds up beautifully 10 years later.

Disc 2 contains a plethora of features. Although I can gripe about the time counter at the top of some of these, or about the lack of some other bonuses that were included on the deluxe LD box set from 1994, but I won't.

The meat of the bonuses lies in the 1994 making-of documentary ""More Loverly Than Ever."" The documentary goes in-depth into the making AND restoration of the movie. The documentary includes interviews (some archival) for cast, crew, Marni Nixon, and even Julie Andrews. Also included are vintage featurettes, archival premiere footage, trailers, and galleries. Also included are clips of ""Show Me"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" including Audrey Hepburn's original singing vocals. Although she did a good job on Loverly, (despite needing Nixon to sing the final lines) hearing Audrey's vocals on Show Me shows that having Nixon sing the songs probably was a better idea than having Audrey sing the songs herself, despite the fact that she tried.

If you're a fan of this movie, or of movie musicals in general, I heartily recommend this beautiful DVD set. If you have a regular TV set, you won't notice any issues in the transfer, and the bonus features delve into the making of the movie. You can't ask for a better DVD edition of My Fair Lady than this.",1138579200,4,3399,4.602310231023102
808878,5,630417893X,"""My Fair Lady"" should be a part of anyone's movie collection for several reasons.  For starters, the plot, adapted from ""Pygmalion,"" written by the great author, George Bernard Shaw, is wonderfully engaging and truly timeless.  The notion that a man handpicks a street urchin of the street, only to mold her into a dignified lady provides an example of the tendency, on the part of human beings, to want to mold and perfect one another at any cost. This is a stark look at a part of this world that is made all too apparent in fashion magazines, relationships between men and women, and even in our own critical self perception.  What's more, this musical has a beautiful score, written by the team of Lerner & Loewe. Some of the most beautiful pieces from musical theatre are showcased here.  (""On the Street Where You Live,""  ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly,"" ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,"" among others)

Although it saddens me that the magical, mesmerizing Julie Andrews (the original Eliza Doolittle), was not used in this film version of the stage musical, we must give Audrey Hepburn credit for her ""loverly"" interpretation of the role.  It is definitely a credit to the judgement and vision of director, George Cukor, the he chose to use Rex Harrison, who truly WAS Dr. Henry Higgins on the stage, and decided to keep in the movie, as well. The chemistry between Hepburn and Harrison is real and believeable, as the complexities of their relationship, as pupil and professor, carry into something of a more personal and (possibly) romantic nature.  This is, of course, left to the interpretation of the beholder.  Though, the legendary song, ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,"" crooned toward the end, by Higgins (Harrison) definitely insinuates that their relationship was more than just one of the an academic nature.

This is a film that has stood the test of time, does not come off as dated, and is totally ""loverly.""  Check it out!",1130457600,4,1944,4.825301204819277

808938,5,630417893X,"The debate will rage eternally whether or not Julie Andrews should have been Eliza Doolittle.  Certainly Audrey Hepburn's performance has been the subject of quite a large backlash, not only from Andrews fans and Broadway purists, but also from a sizeable number of moviegoers who flout the trend by hating Hepburn and not having any other outlet for this resentment.  What!  You didn't know that there are those among us who actually dislike Audrey Hepburn!  Well, it may be hard to believe but it's true.  When I was growing up I met a sizable pack of aging habitues who dismissed her for simply being uppity and newfangled, not a patch on the ""real"" Hepburn (Kate), and spoken of in the tones you often hear Britney Spears referred to today, as utterly talentless.

Certainly it must have taken Audrey a certain amount of, well, balls, to use the Hepburn name when there was already a well-establish star with that name.  It sort of boggles the imagination.  Did Kate Hepburn ever reject her?  What secrets did George Cukor, who directed them both, take to his grave?  I remember hearing one story that he took the assignment of directing MY FAIR LADY (""with Hepburn"") having signed on the bottom line and only then did he realize he'd been saddled with Audrey.

That can't really be true but it shows something of the difficulties Audrey must have faced when trying to put together her own rendition of Eliza Doolittle.  To my mind, she's exquisite and she doesn't overact the guttersnipe.  Very much.  Indeed I can't imagine Julie Andrews playing the part-in the movie.  Andrews is terrific on the legendary OCA, but the movie needed Audrey and that's where I stand on this momentous topic.  Hooray for the DVD which gives us her own singing for two of the numbers on alternate tracks.  She's not so bad at singing!  Marni Nixon's fine, but Audrey is the real thing.

808939,4,630417893X,"Although a brilliant movie, there are three problems with My Fair Lady on DVD: 1) the movie was designed to be viewed on the big screen, 2) the audio commentary is poor and 3) Audrey Hepburn.

1) Cukor shot this movie as a direct adaptation from the stage, which was appropriate for theatrical release, but not for home viewing. For example, a great deal of action in this movie is conveyed via the actor's facial expressions. However, Cukor frequently includes wide-angle shots that encompass the entire set. Appropriate enough for the theatre, but a great deal is lost when viewing at home, even on a larger flat-screen monitor.

2) I listened to about an hour of the audio commentary and then could bear no more. It is largely a bitching session about how difficult it was to restore the film, containing technical detail appropriate for a UCLA film school student, but not the general public.

3) Audrey Hepburn was a great actor. I've seen a number of her films on the big screen at the Stanford Theatre (a wonderfully restored theatre in Palo Alto that screens the classics). However, Audrey overacts Eliza the guttersnipe and her lip sync performance is embarrassing. She nearly recovers with her Ascot performance, which is absolutely stunning and hilarious. This is Audrey at her best. However, clearly this is a role meant for Julie Andrews.

808988,3,630417893X,"Of all the films on Audrey Hepburn's impressive resume, I have to admit this 1964 multiple Oscar winner may be the most disappointing, though ironically it is probably her most famous role. Veteran women's director George Cukor seems to have made an irreparable error in filming the Cinderella-style story in such a stage-bound and often stilted manner, obviously to reflect more accurately the then-revered Broadway version. What is missing is true cinematic invention in telling a most enchanting story with interesting questions raised around the power of personal transformation.

What remains true, however, is the fact that composer Frederic Lowe and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner (who wrote the screenplay) have fashioned the quintessential Broadway musical by turning George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion"" into a frothy ugly duckling tale filled with some of the best known show tunes ever: ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"", ""The Rain in Spain"", ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", ""On the Street Where You Live"", ""I'm Getting Married in the Morning"", ""With a Little Bit of Luck"", ""Show Me"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face."" As if you don't know already, the songs interweave through a story that follows the evolution of a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, who is trained by Professor Henry Higgins, a misogynistic linguistics expert and confirmed bachelor, to speak properly within six months, the result of a challenge and bet with the dotty Colonel Pickering. Lengthy elocution lessons follow, interrupted by her mercenary drunk of a father and a persistent, love-struck swain. Eliza makes an eye-catching though ultimately embarrassing first appearance at the opening day Ascot Races, but triumphs among the bluebloods at the climactic Embassy Ball. Inevitably, Higgins becomes smitten with his transformed pupil, who returns to him only after proving her personal liberation.

Visually, despite Cecil Beaton's extravagant costumes and Gene Allen's detailed art direction, there is a persistent lethargy captured on screen perhaps because the camera set-ups feel so static. Hepburn seems to enjoy playing the guttersnipe, though her lowbrow manner never feels very authentic perhaps because of our predisposition to the carefully groomed actress already a dozen years into her career at that point. Even though she seems a mite mature for the role, she looks stunning after her aural breakthrough, especially in her elaborate Ascot dress and hat. Her lip-synching to Marni Nixon's vocals is a problem though not because she is not doing her own singing but because of the sometimes jarring disparity between her throaty speaking voice and the soprano singing voice coming out of her. Rex Harrison plays Higgins as the role he was born to play and certainly convinces as a demanding linguist. He seems less assured as a romantic lead, and consequently we are rather indifferent at the end to his romantic fate with Eliza. For all its flaws, however, the movie does manage to convey the musicality of the stage version effectively. I just wish the rest of the movie was up to the level of the score.

The two-disc set is a great package for aficionados. The second disc includes an excellent making-of documentary made in 1994 and hosted by Jeremy Brett, who plays Eliza's unfulfilled suitor, Freddy, in the movie, as well as alternate takes which use Hepburn's  true vocals on ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"" and ""Show Me"" (she's quite good but obviously not trained enough for the other more demanding songs).",1110412800,3,3508,5.225577264653642
808989,4,630417893X,"My Fair Lady is a musical that will live forever without a doubt and the movie version, despite the scandal that it caused in 1964 because Jack Warner cast Audrey Hepburn in the role of Eliza Doolittle instead of Julie Andrews, is still one of the finest musicals ever made. Hollywood was incredibly petty about that issue. Julie Andrews received Best Actress for her role in Mary Poppins that year, and Audrey Hepburn wasn't even mentioned, a nasty slap in the face when she was charming in the role. Today people watching the film would never believe such nonsense; the film is so enchanting nobody could believe such trash could have taken place. The musical took the best of Broadway, brought it to the screen with an amazing success -- shame on the people who tried to bring shame on such a great work!

The Lerner-Loewe score is classic and won the hearts of the world easily when the show premired years ago. Even today, the music serenades listeners with the same charm. Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) meets with Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White), by accident the same night he meets the very unkempt and raucous flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), whose coarse manner and poor English doom her to a life of poverty and gloom. When he boasts that he could teach her and pass her off as someone in a higher class, he never realizes that she might actually be listening to him, but listen she does, and to his astonishment, she shows up at his home, intending to pay ""not more than a shilling, take it or leave it"" to learn her own language. Pickering, hearing that someone has actually taken Higgings up on his dare, agrees to fund the lessons to watch and see if it will work or fail.

What follows could be considered a comedy of errors or disasters, depending on how you look at it. Eliza finds herself working a lot harder than she ever dreamed, and suddenly she has to do things she never did before, like take a bath every day in hot water. Before long, her father shows up (Stanley Holloway), and in comes the culture clash of the Cockneys and the middle class, a classic British study in social conflict. Higgins can't resist meddling and writes off to a philanthropist, telling of ""an original moralist, one Alfred P. Doolittle,"" and thus lights the fuse to a time bomb. Of course, Alfred Doolittle is all too ready to part with his daughter, provided he gets some money for drinking as part of the deal -- so much for his ""original morals""!

Then one evening, it happens. Eliza has her breakthrough. She actually makes it. Her English is intact. Everyone celebrates in the paean to ""The Rain in Spain."" Delirious with joy, they plan an event at Ascot to try out her wings. The only problem is that while she speaks like a lady, she has not yet mastered BEING a lady yet, not to the extent that is required at Ascot. However, with more work, more effort, and more polish, ultimately she does make it at a ball at which she convinces everyone that she is a princess.

The success is complete -- but what now? Eliza has convinced everyone that she is royalty, but where does she go? What does she do? Higgins has won his bet. Everyone is busy congratulating him. Meanwhile, she cannot go back to the life she had. She cannot be what she once was. She is lost, and now she is angry that she has been made into nothing. She decides to leave and goes to the home of Higgins' mother (Gladys Cooper) to seek asylum. It is there that she finally declares her independence in the song ""Without You."" It is only then that Henry Higgins realizes that Eliza has come to mean more to him than just a student, that she has somehow become someone dear in his life, as he expresses in the song ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.""

The musical, unlike the original play upon it was based, actually becomes a strange sort of love story in which both Higgins and Eliza do admit a bond between themselves and remain together. Something about the lyric quality of the musical has made it a timeless classic. Now that it has been preserved on DVD, there is no doubt in my mind that it will remain so.

So why do I give it four stars and not five? Because as you will notice when viewing it, there are many parts of the musical that need an audience's reaction to be complete. A perfect example is the scene at the race at Ascot. When Eliza shouts at the race, without the entire audience's reaction, the scene comes across as tepid compared to when there is a full audience; the audience's laughter is almost part of the script. Another such place is when Alfred P. Doolittle enters and laughs; the look on Henry Higgins face when he smells the alcohol on his breath always generates a guffaw from a large audience, but when a person watches it alone, such a moment can slip by almost unnoticed. So much of the script seems to include audience reaction that My Fair Lady seems to be best viewed with a large group of people admiring it together. The greatness of the musical cannot be diminished, no matter what, but when you view these scenes, you'll have to admit that it would be different with a large audience laughing.

When the film was originally made, Audrey Hepburn fully expected to sing the entire part herself, but later most of her role was dubbed by Marni Nixon. This decision came as a surprise to her, and not entirely a pleasant one. In the song ""Just You Wait,"" she does sing the opening of the song herself, but the middle part where the more lyrical strain is heard, the dubbing is very obvious. An astute listener can tell when she is singing and when Marni Nixon is singing; she does take credit for at least part of the singing role in the film.",1110153600,2,5678,4.4854932301740815

That set featured several minutes of extra footage from the Oscar show (Joan Crawford presenting George Cukor the Best Director Award, and Cukor's acceptance speech; Audrey Hepburn giving the Best Actor Award to Rex Harrison, and Harrison's gracious acceptance; Gregory Peck giving out the Best Picture Oscar to Jack L. Warner). All that shows up on this new Special Edition DVD is Warner's brief words of thanks upon receiving his award.

Also, three sequences on the Special Features disc (the Hollywood premiere footage, and the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Martin Scorsese bonus interviews) include a rather distracting time counter in the upper left hand corner of the screen, that runs through out the sequences (at least on my copy).

Recently movies like Moulin Rouge! And Chicago has given musicals an awakening. However, we need more! Directors can turn to movies like this and the ones I mentioned above for inspiration, because these movies were created to give the best entertainment for a short period (while doing it with a lot of style).

The singing part of the musical is a key factor that contributes and complements many parts of the play written by Shaw. Even though the reader has more space to imagine each character and situation in the play, the musical exposes the settings and the actors just as a similar as Shaw would have wanted. Despite this, it is necessary to state that Shaw's criticism is most likely to impact the reader more profoundly than what the musical would. I say so because the music involves singing well and having a nice voice, which might have put into second plan the true intentions of Pygmalion. In addition, I believe that the director of My Fair Lady made his own interpretation, which could have emphasized certain aspects that Shaw did not take seriously into account when writing his master piece. An example of this is the character Freddy. In the play, Freddy is portrayed a low class ""gentleman"" who has no talents at all; However, in the musical Freddy is shown as a high class person which is very concerned about him and his surroundings. Considering that the musical had slight modifications to the play, which is totally untreatable, I have to agree that having read the book and watched the movie, helped me to appreciate Pygmalion and  all the critics found in it. Because the movie portrays a specific perspective of the play, and the Pygmalion another one, I obtained  more knowledge about Shaw's point of view and about his complex personality.",1101254400,4,1625,4.779359430604982

Now compared to book I think that the book is better because it has more to it. It is how Shaw wanted it and in the movie some changes have been applied like the horse race and also the way Eliza is. I think that Eliza has not been interpreted well in the movie because in the book we can picture her really poor girl that doesn't know how to speak well and in the movie she is not portrait like that. I'm not saying that she speaks really well in the movie but she speaks a bit better than how she really is in the book.

I think that the movie was really boring and `like all the movies that come from books it followed the same routine of the book being better than the movie.

It tries to show the feelings and the personality of the characters in the book but I don't think this is done too well. The book and movie vary in certain aspects, like the fact that the movie is a musical and also some of the words are changed, added, and sometimes even left out. I think that many of Shaw's satirical ideas and messages are misinterpreted in the movie or not shown well enough.

Some of the characters do not have the same personality as the book. For example, Higgins, in the book, has a very strong and controlling personality, as well as Eliza. In the movie, though, Eliza's part of this personality was not portrayed as well. It seemed as though she was more of a gentle women just trying to survive. Some of these things were changed to make it a more interesting movie and to capture its audience, but I think Shaw would have been disappointed by it. In the movie they exaggerate the upper class and its elegance, like in the party where everyone is dressed in black and white and everything was done with extreme care and elegance. Also, the part where Higgins puts the teacup on his head was funny but not what Shaw would have done.

I think that although the movie was good and entertaining, it cannot really compete with the book since it does not express Shaw's original ideas. The movie changed some ideas around and added new things to the setting and characters to make it a more interesting movie but I think that Shaw would have definitely made the move differently.",1101168000,2,1572,4.473867595818815
809041,1,630417893X,"Someone once said that with great power comes great responsibility but I suppose George Cukor never got the sense of the famous quote. The movie, an adaptation of the book My Fair Lady by the author George Bernar's Shaw, fails to portray the novelists view on society as it twists the content of the book, formatting it into a very hollywoodesque borderline furthermore, a joyful musical with now lesson whatsoever.  On a first basis the characters are a simplistic retake on the ones from the book. Eliza played by the astonishing Audrey Hepburn deviates the original character creating a shallowest one. The character does not reflect middle class morality as it falls short in demonstrating the real suffering of the deserving/undeserving poor. Her perfect pronunciation when singing (Marni Nixon) confuses the audience, and discounts the whole concept of her having an awful accent, not helping at all to pass on the notion. Further on, Mr. Higgins played by Rex Harrison enlarges the concept of charm in the character that initially had no charm at all. On the other hand it enhances decently the concept of the manly prototype but at the same type it goes way over board creating an overacted personage and at the same type failing to reflect the division of classes. As a whole the characters fail to demonstrate the main concept: social prestige presenting a Hollywood classic but not a movie based on a classic novel of the English language. Further on the classic ending of the play is cruelly twisted into the one needed to make of this movie a chick flick with out content. The ending is nothing more than a cruel made up scene that fitted correctly into the poor version by Cukor.

On the other hand the movie as a production remains a complete success. The set designed to represent the typical grey London at the beginning of the century, fully addresses Shaw's desired scenery. Furthermore the dialogues are extracted in their majority from the book, helping at least in that section to remain faith to the play.

To sum up, the movie is nothing more than clich version meant to be a Hollywood classic. This movie results unattractive if looked at with an English student's eye. Poor Bernard Shaw must be rolling in his grave.",1100995200,4,2242,4.833333333333333

From my point of view the movie, My Fair Lady is a fairly good adaptation of Shaws play'. It is true that some of Shaw's original ideas are missing or are misinterpreted. From the point of view of producers and directors, it is understandable that they had to change the play in its movie adaptation in order to make it interesting to the viewers and maintain profits. For example the people at the horse races dressed in black and white was a funny scene, but it wasn't anything like that in Shaw's play.

Overall the movie for me as a 16 year old who is more interested in action movies from this century was not one of the most exiting I have seen. I must confess I fell sleep watching it, but in the the time the movie came out it was a huge succes.

Earlier I was talking about the diferences between the movie and the play but there are many aspects of the film that were very succesfully passed from paper to film. For example the character of Henry Higgins maintained the feeling it gave us when we read the play. Rex Harrison's performance as Mr Higgins was indead one of the best Ive seen. He really kept the satire in his character. When Eliza embarassed him at the tea party and he put the tea cup over his head and turnd away, it was a funny bit of satire

Audrey Hepburn also had an outstanding performance. We could see the changes in Eliza very clearly as she became more educated and changed from a flower girl to a lady.

We could see how Eliza started to talk differently and act differently. She becomes a lady at the end of the  movie and we can see that she cant return to the streets.

In this way the movie and the play were the same.",1100822400,,1732,4.2782874617737

The only downside I see to such an impressive masterpiece is the fact that much of Shaw's humor, and views are striken from MFL. This is a fault. But nevertheless I am compelled to agree with anyone in all their senses, that without doubt this is an ABSOLUTE classic.

If I had to pick between the film and the book, I would have to choose the book, not that the movie is not an ABSOLUTE masterpiece, but more that the book, as is the case with most books taken to the screen, is much MUCH better. In MLF Freddy apears to be a highly respectable young man, in the book he is just a liar trying to ""wing"" it amongst the high-class, Claram, his sister does not even appear, what's up with that?",1100822400,,977,4.275675675675676
809044,4,630417893X,"My Fair Lady is a great musical and a marvelous movie to go and watch, in my opinion is not a good interpretation of G.B. Shaw's, Pygmalion. It is not strong as it could be. We can clearly appreciate that most of the script is followed. The characters in the musical are not as good as the ones play, this is because some of the character are rather weak in comparison to the play or in other words the perception you get about them when reading Pygmalion.

Eliza Doolittle, a beautiful, funny and smart flower girl is interpreted perfectly by Audrey Hepburn, who gets into the character and adds flavor to the musical, Mr. Higgins is also very well performed and I love the quality of expression and essence of Shaw's that the actor get to put on the play.  I found Colonel Pickering's character rather weak and quiet and Mr. Doolittle didn't fall in what I pictured, all of the other characters even the ones who were not suppose to, were joyful and add a soul of comedy and yet cynism to the play, although they didn't get to the cynism that Shaw skillfully gets to.

I think G.B. Shaw would be disappointed if he had seen this version of his so famous play; the musical barely represents the satire he in his book. The middle class morality and the hypocrisy there could be in the upper class are scarcely represented; thus musical is more a comedy in comparison to the play. I think Shaw would have found ridiculous and nonsensical that gentlemen such as: Mr. Higgins and Colonel Pickering sing in the play, and that the whole affair of singing the author would have considered it silly.

Although the script was followed some scenes were replaced, therefore we can say that the movie is not a loyal representation of the play. I think the reason for substituting some scenes is because they didn't fit into what the musical was, but it confuses me somewhat that characters like Clara don't appear in the play.

The setting of the musical was great, I think that it concurred with the original play, and the costumes were ideal for the characters. In conclusion I think My Fair Lady is a great movie to watch more than once, yet it does not transmit the essence of Mr. Shaw's original play.",1100476800,,2195,4.5188916876574305
809045,4,630417893X,"The film ""My Fair Lady"",  being an adaptation of the play Pygmalion by G.B Shaw, destroys the complete satire that is presented in the play by Shaw's cynical interpretations. Shaw's persistent and comical sincerity humanizes the social class difference, marriage, and various themes which are presented throughout the play and brings comedy and drama to a more ""real"" level. The film ""My Fair Lady"" was nominated as the best musical of the year in 1964, presenting the best duplicate of the play Pygmalion. This film did not exactly adapt to the original play of Shaw's Pygmalion, because it cracked the satire presented in the play which gave it originality and excellence. I believe that the whole satire was destroyed because of the musical part, in which the feelings and expressions showed were controversial from the real play. The whole point of the satire and the exaggerated humor and ridicule was constructed to show the myth of Pygmalion, and disappeared due to the whole concept of the movie.

The Pygmalion representation of society was taken by this musical and changed the themes presented in the play. I'm not saying that the movie does not try to keep some specific lines from the play, and tries in a way to perform the original script throughout the film, but the musical fails to do this consistently. The switching of the themes in the film portrays another feeling than that Pygmalion. The character interpretations that appear in the movie are different to those that appear in the original play which exemplify the contrast between the undeserving and deserving poor. The relationship between Higgins and the flower girl, Eliza, were presented by Higgins as an understandable man while in the play he was the most close minded, rude and detestable man. Eliza, the flower girl, acted by Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful woman whose performance was great in showing real emotions, like her attitude and her way of speaking, but lost all the original emotions when the musical part appeared. Eliza's affection towards Higgins was showed during a musical solo that the flower girl performed. Her facial expressions of happiness were so evident, that it made it very different from the play, where her emotions were mainly stated by words and not physical expressions. The singing was not actually done by the actress, but by Marni Nixon. The performances were not as excellent as what I expected them to be. The characters did not portray the real characteristics of the original play of Pygmalion. The emotions were so enhanced that it made the film a ridiculous duplicate of the play. The satire and cynicism presented by Shaw was swept away throughout the whole firm.

The ending differed in both the play and in the movie which change the whole theme that Eliza presented. In the play the ending is very ironic or almost sarcastic using a humorous exaggeration of a typical happy ending story where Eliza got married and ran a flower shop missing her days with Higgins who helped her become the women that she was. In the film we can see that it ended by Eliza staying at Higgins house. To conclude, I believe that ""My Fair lady"" was not even close to a good adaptation of the play Pygmalion because it destructed the whole satire that truly represented the myth of Pygmalion.",1100390400,,3298,4.885714285714286
809046,3,630417893X,"After watching My Fair Lady, my dislike for visual interpretations of literature has increased monumentally. Although the film might have minimal qualities, which would entitle it to the numerous awards it has received, it is an understatement to say that it does not accurately portray G.B. Shaw's Pygmalion. An author who very clearly includes a cynical tone in the play, and the element of satire is indeed the entire ""make-up"" of the play, would greatly dissaprove of this film.

It is evident to me that the producers and directors of this musical made a half-hearted attempt at accurately portraying the message which emerges in the play. In fact, I find that Pygmalion was simply an object used to obtain characters and events, yet the main conflict of the play was not at all perceivable in the movie. The idea of a satire is to ""ridicule or hold up to contempt the faults of individuals or of groups"". Frankly, the entire concept created by G.B. Shaw was ignored by the makers of this movie.

Not only was the play generally not portrayed accurately, but the acting was not exceptional. It is to my belief, that when a movie producer decides to base a movie on a play or novel they should make the ultimate attempt at portraying the characters accurately. After reading the play, my perception of the characters was very extreme. Seeing that the play is a complete ridicule of different social classes, I imagined Henry Higgins as a completely detestable human being. Not physically, but in the way he carried himself, and his treatment of others. In the movie, the transition he made from being a mean and classist person to accepting Eliza was abrupt and unnatural. On a different level the interpretation made by Audrey Hepburn of Eliza, was quite unbearable. She was almost ""too pretty"" as a flower girl, and although she did an exceptional job pulling off the accent, her acting did not meet my expectation of Eliza.

The fact that this is a ""Hollywood"" interpretation truly drives the movie away from the play. It is usual for this type of film to include the ""cheesy"" aspects of cinematic production, which give it this denomination. The film portrays the story as one of love, rather than the satirical and cynical tale that G.B. Shaw tells. The worst part of this film, has to be the musical aspect. It is very difficult, to portray cynicism through music. In fact, the music makes it quite a ridiculous interpretation of the play. It is definately the wrong script to adapt as a musical film.

On a final note, I have to say that i am definately biased, having read the play prior to seeing the film. I saw the movie with a pre-established view of what i believed would be an accurate portrayal of the play, and was very dissapointed with the result. The movie disregards the objective of the play, taking away the veyr thing that makes Pygmalion an excellent read.",1100390400,,2884,4.727634194831014

People often say that it is a very bad adaptation, an adaptation that maybe insults the writing of George Bernard Shaw. Maybe the director of the movie, George Cukor is to blame and also the writer that turned it to a musical, Alan Jay Lerner. Whatsoever, they were making a musical out of an excellent play, a musical that was adapted to the period of time it was being displayed to the world, the year 1964, a year located post-McCarthyism and before people realized the conflict in Vietnam, so therefore people was expecting a happy and cheerful musical.

To my opinion Audrey Hepburn (goddess of cinema) helped the so called satire the play is supposed to show. Her job in this movie is totally credible, whatsoever I think people expect a poorer looking girl after reading Pygmalion, also she doesn't even sing in the movie, a singer does it for her, known as Marni Nixon. Professor Henry Higgins played by Rex Harrison was not such a credible character as Eliza, I expected a more arrogant man, well in the movie he is a really arrogant man, but Harrison could have put way much more charisma into Higgins since he is a really good actor, whatsoever not a good singer, another fact that maybe ""Pygmalion"" was not made for being a musical, since Harrison was never singing just talking really fast, going along with the music. Alfred Doolittle (Stanley Holloway) and Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) were another two excellent performances, since they matched my expectations after reading Shaw's ""Pygmalion""

For my opinion Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" could had been a better movie considering the plot, characters, setting, etc, were based on Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", having readers with excitement at the beginning of the movie and leaving them with a little disappointment after watching it.

After watching ""My Fair Lady"", directed by George Cukor and mainly based on G.B Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", one can say that it is a tolerable, yet not very accurate interpretation of the play since the original satire loses its essence in the movie.

The exaggeration, depicted by the actress personifying Eliza becomes not only irritating but absurd to the extent that it does not reflect Shaw's intention accurately. The actress overstresses not only the accent, which is supposed to be that way, but movements, reactions, etc. as well as the actors personifying Freddy and Higgins.

This satire is mainly expressed, in the play through Higgins and Eliza relationship, or the few conversations between Higgins and Mr. Doolittle; as well as the contrast between the undeserving and deserving poor, or the social meeting in Mrs. Higgins' place. In the play, this technique is abundant and expressed indirectly, yet not irritating as it is in the movie. In ""My Fair Lady"", messages from the play are often, if not always, sent to the audience through songs (Eliza's solos for instance) were the director emphasizes the most; where as in the play the use of language combined with satirical sentiment and the ambience emphasized the importance and the message transmitted. It is in the play, where the satire is the main focus, yet not in the movie.

Concerning the script, dialogues were, indeed, very accurate and from that perspective, portrayed an accurate interpretation of the play. But the emphasis of a musical is very distinct than the main focus of a play.

Overall, both the musical and the play focus on the story of a flower girl that soon becomes the caprice project of two Gentlemen: Mr. Higgins and Colonel Pickering. But it is evident that the interpretation of the director differs from the original version. It is for these reasons, that the movie ""My Fair Lady"" would be seen just as acceptable and a little bit inaccurate according to Shaw.

809098,1,630417893X,"My Fair Lady, an award winning movie, for its great musical performances, and its ""impressive"" acting. This musical, an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, is said to be one of the greatest movies of its time. After reading the original play by Shaw, I can say that this movie is one of the worst adaptations from a book to the big screen. You see, Pygmalion is a play based on Shaw's cynical satire, by making fun of the social class difference, and using comical ideas such as the ""undeserving poor,"" he creates a masterpiece that is worth passing on from generation to generation. My Fair Lady degrades what Shaw took so long to build, from his first edition of Pygmalion to the last; this movie destroys the essence of the cynicism and satirical content.

One of the ways that Shaw's satire is destroyed is the fact that My Fair Lady is a musical. Musicals usually involve jolly tunes and sad tunes, but not really allowing any room for cynicism. From what I have learned about Shaw, he does not seem like the person who would enjoy one of his plays to be morphed into some dandy musical, especially if it does not respect the essence of what Pygmalion represents.

Even though this movie does not represent Shaw's satire in Pygmalion, it does try to keep some aspects of the original play. We find that in the script of My Fair Lady, there are still lines from Pygmalion, which is a failed attempt to preserve the play's originality.

Hollywood is known for inventing stories, just as they did in My Fair Lady. By adding things to make the movie more appealing to what the movie audience wants, the story loses its essence. In My Fair Lady there are parts that never appear in the play, for example, when Eliza goes to the horse races, this never happens in the book, Eliza goes to Mrs. Higgins' house, where she is tested. With this added scene, the book is changed even if the same thing happens in both places. The way that Hollywood changes Pygmalion in an abrupt way, is the ending of the movie. Eliza ends up together with Higgins, which is something that is left unclear in the book, if anything Eliza ends up with Freddy in Pygmalion.

We can see that My Fair Lady is an inadequate adaptation of G.B. Shaw's masterpiece, Pygmalion. By allowing Hollywood to warp the essence of Shaw's cynical satire, the meaning of the word adaptation was destroyed.

Acceptable because the whole essence of satire is kind of watered down in the musical; yes indeed some script was used from ""Pygmalion"" but still the attitude that the actors portrayed at some moments were not as ""satirical"" as in the book. My fair Lady is a fabulous musical itself, but if compared to the book ""Pygmalion"" it is not the most exact depiction of it. I believe that G.B. Shaw's ironic and satirical humor is not shown as much as it should be; the whole idea of illustrating ""Pygmalion"" should be placing as a main theme in the movie, the satire of the various topics in the book like the relationship between Higgins and Eliza, The deserving poor in contrast to the undeserving poor like Mr. Doolittle, etc. The strange affection /hate relationship between Eliza Doolittle and Higgins is one of the main things that represent the rare, yet exceptional factors of G.B. Shaw's satirical themes. In My Fair Lady the irony in the relationship is shown in a different way; Eliza openly shows her care and affection for Higgins during one of her musical solos, while in ""Pygmalion"" this wasn't shown by Eliza in such a direct way, instead it is written in way that the reader is to assume of it. Another way in which the marvelous musical My fair Lady, as I said before a great movie itself; that is, if it weren't to portray ""Pygmalion"", makes a change at the ending of the movie; the ending of Pygmalion clearly shows G.B. Shaw's traditionally sarcasm take place; as Eliza leaves Higgins house, marries a middle class young man, gets to run a flower shop but can't really handle the job, and ironically there was still a part of her that missed Higgins even though he's behavior towards her wasn't the best. Eliza has to adapt herself to the middle class, when all she knew about now was high class.  It was as if she were trapped inside a world she didn't want to be in anymore and didn't know anymore. In My Fair Lady Eliza gets to stay at Higgins house and not got through the changes and desires she couldn't have as in the book.",1100390400,,2136,4.533678756476684

809101,5,630417893X,"I first saw this film shortly after it was released on Christmas day, 1964, when I was 14 years old. It captivated me then in a way I have never forgotten; it still does.

For this viewer, this is quite simply the greatest musical ever made. Perhaps Rogers & Hammerstein produced a greater number of high quality musicals than Lerner & Lowe, but this product of genius enjoys pride of place as the all time best.

Call me an insufferable stick-in-the-mud, but I generally do not seek out pure entertainment. I love fine story telling in print or on film as much as anyone else, but I generally look for some edifying content, something that reaches into the human experience emotionally or intellectually. This motion picture is unique among all I have seen in my lifetime where the pure entertainment value is so high, it requires no other qualities to make it completely worthwhile -- to see not just once, but many times.

This impeccable entertainment quality comes from the absolutely ingenious music and lyrics throughout, and the incomparable artistry of the sets and costumes. This movie is a flawless balance of true-to-life characterizations and Cinderella-like fantasy. Every part of this production adds to the effect of enchantment.

Rex Harrison was born for this role, and Marni Nixon's singing voice, supplied for Audrey Hepburn, is out of this world.  Less well known is Bill Shirley, who supplied the singing voice for the one song of Freddy Eynsford Hill (Jeremy Brett).  Others, including Andy Williams, have recorded ""On the Street Where You Live"" over the years, but the pace, power, and clarity of Bill Shirley's singing is unequalled.

My Fair Lady is an unsurpassed visual and aural showpiece, show-biz at its best, making good use of the timeless Pygmalion theme, and like other movies using this theme, doing it better than George Bernard Shaw; it is in the movies where one sees this theme treated with romance.

Come to think of it, how can I contend such beauty and artistry is not edifying? I really can't, can I?",1092787200,6,2044,4.870317002881844
809102,4,630417893X,"MFL is a marvellous film about a professor who turns a common flower girl into a lady.  It is full of sing-a-long songs and funny moments.  It is basically a classic for all the right reasons!  Plenty of re-watch factor makes it a film to own.

In 1994, the film was restored and thank the lord they did!  The film's negative was almost lost forever.  In fact, the film had become yellow-tinged and full of scratches, blotches and all the rest!  It would have been a very sad day for the movie industry if a flim like this had been lost.

The original DVD that featured this new restoration was released in the late 90's. This DVD included a 9 minute featurette, actor profiles, audio commentary, and Audrey Hepburn singing in 2 scenes.

This original 1-disc DVD has since been updated to a special 2-Disc Edition.  Which one to get? I have both so I feel qualified to answer this.  The new DVD includes all the features found on the original DVD, except the actor profiles.  The new DVD once again includes the restored print but is apparently a new transfer from the restored print.  However, according to a report that I have read, the new transfer is not perfect and has aliasing problems throughout.  The average watcher probably won't pick up on this detail.  If this is an issue to you, purchase the original edition DVD where the transfer has been given two thumbs up!

The advantage of the special 2-Disc Edition DVD  is that it includes a 58 minute 1994 documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett (Audrey's love interest in the film).  Jeremy is no longer with us, so it's nice to have this as a piece of nostalgia. On top of this, there are many more features on this disc that aren't included on the original DVD such as footage from the film's premiere, production dinner, as well as discussions with Rex and Audrey.

The choice is easy.  If you're a fan of the film and don't care for all the extras, buy the original DVD.  You at least get the best transfer.  If you do care about having all the extras, buy both!",1089590400,608,2020,4.461748633879782
809103,5,630417893X,"The music from ""My Fair Lady"" makes it easily one of my favorite musicals with ""I could have danced all night"", ""Wouldn't it be Loverly?"", ""The Street Where you Live"", and Stanley Holloway's rousing showstoppers ""With a Little Bit of Bloomin' Luck"" and ""Get me to the Church on Time"".
It's well chronicled how much gnashing of teeth surrounded the Hollywood decision to leave out the then-unknown Julie Andrews, who was the new toast of the stage as Eliza Doolittle, and instead cast the more bankable Audrey Hepburn.  Hollywood rewarded Ms. Andrews with ""Mary Poppins"" and an Oscar, and although I'd love to have seen Julie Andrews in this role, 4 decades later I can't complain about Audrey Hepburn.
Rex Harrison's reprises Henry Higgins from the stage, and I frankly can't think of another actor who would bring the same English Arrogance and tongue-in-cheekiness to the role.  The interactions between Harrison, Hepburn and Wilfred Hyde-White as Colonel Pickering, especially in the early part of the film, are witty, entertaining, and move the narrative right along without pausing for exposition.  The Higgins character is a cad, very full of himself, and he makes the mistake of treating those he feels are socially inferior poorly.  The Colonel Pickering character acts as a surrogate for the audience, observing the educated but pompous Professor Higgins and allowing us to feel not TOO badly that poor Eliza has come under the influences of Higgins.
Stanley Holloway recreates Alfred P. Doolittle, Eliza's father, from the stage, and although his character has as many moral deficiencies as Professor Higgins (at one point he shows up at Higgins doorstep hoping to extort money from Professor Higgins for ""shacking up"" with Eliza) and is much less educated and with a much lower social standing, he is nonetheless a ""good ol' bloke"" and his moments in the film are among the most memorable, especially the previously mentioned show-stopping musical numbers.
The final act feels a little soap-opera-ish between Jeremy Brett as Freddy fawning over Eliza and Professor Higgins beginning to appreciate her fine qualities at the same time.  This portion produces two of the finer musical moments as Freddy sings ""On The Street Where You Live"" and Higgins croons ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"".
Since George Bernard Shaw died in 1950 it's purely speculative to wonder what he'd have thought about the production of his Pygmalion story.  I'm guessing he'd have liked it.  If you like musicals, I'm guessing you will too. Enjoy.",1086739200,6,2535,5.108695652173913
809104,2,630417893X,"WARNING: All the five stars refer to the movie itself, and does not address the issue of whether paying for the second disc is a rip-off.  Five stars for the single disc version was richly deserved.  I had half expected the 2 disc version to have DTS since they shifted virtually all the extra features from disc 1 to disc two.  The only thing left on disc 1 was the movie, same commentary, same subtitles and audio track.  If they had an audio track with Audrey singing in place of Marni Nixon, it would have been a dream dvd.  For some inexplicable reason, the single disc version was among the Amazon top 100 discs in 2002 for some time, although it has been out since the mid-90s.  Amazon's editor was correct when he said the main attraction of the 2nd disc was the 58 minute Documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett.  Move along folks, folks, nothing to see here, nothing really new unless you are time warped back one or two decades.  A concise version of this documentary would be ""The Fairest Fair Lady"" which is already in the single disc version.

You already HAVE the Audrey Hepburn Vocals in the single disc version.  The rest of the stuff in disc 2 is usually given away FREE, like in Gladiator, Last Samurai, Master and Commander, where one viewing of the stills is more than enough.

Now, the sellers of the 2-disc set have actually REMOVED the CAST AND CREW section found in the one disc version.  This Cast and Crew with filmographies and biographies contain a huge chunk of valuable information including the fact that Audrey's given name was Edda, not Audrey.  Do not throw away your one disc version.  If you bought the 2 disc version, you might want to buy the single- disc version to find out where Audrey Hepburn was born, won the Oscar and got nominated. What were the other actors like Wilfred Hyde-White doing other than My Fair Lady.

I tell you what I like about the 2 Disc version:

1.  the interviews with Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison at the 1963 production Kickoff Dinner, with a couple of jokes from Mr Warner.
2.  George Cukor directing Baroness Rothschild: a Henry Higgins coaching Eliza Doolitle parody.  The audio track ran for only a few minutes, and I had a new found respect for Directors. Even a Baroness needs lessons in elocution.  When I watch the movie again, I will imagine George Cukor speaking using the actors and actresses as his instrument.  It explains how Cukor's actresses got their Oscars.
3.  The Los Angeles Premiere in B&W is a few minutes of glitterati distraction.

The rest of Disc 2 is really scraping the floor of the store-room.  For those who already own the single disc edition, and do not have disposable income to burn, get the 2 disc edition of the TEN COMMANDMENTS instead.  For the price of 5 commandments (about half the price of the 2 disc My Fair Lady), you will get more than double the enjoyment, making it look like ""the TWENTY COMMANDMENTS"".  That is where a second disc is not purely a money making exercise: thou shalt not steal from gullible covetuous dvd buyers.

Rex Harrison Golden Globe Acceptance is a clip from the Andy William's show, where he apologised for not being at the real event, so he accepted it on AW's show.  Shame.

Academy Awards Cermony Highlights: just one minute or less of Mr Warner accepting the oscar for best picture.  Not one bit of the other awards at all.

So two stars for the additional info on disc two.  I would buy anything remotely related to my favourite musical, but if I were to search my heart for value added, I would say two extra stars is very very generous.  Now, if ever they come out with a DTS version, we will have to throw the whole TWENTY COMMANDMENTS at this bunch of crooks for not putting DTS into this version.

Do you really need Martin Scorsese and Andrew Lloyd Weber's comments on My Fair Lady to supplement your own?

I have grown very fond of the British culture with the language drillling, the high tea, the Ascot Day and many other plots in the film.

809158,5,630417893X,"Lerner and Loewe's musical version of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion got its first cinematic colour treatment (q.v. the 1938 version with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller) as well as eight Oscars.  Much of the story's already known--how Professor Henry Higgins, an expert in phonetics (the science of speech), takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney flower girl working in Covent Garden into a lady.  That ""draggletail guttersnipe,"" that ""squashed cabbage leaf,"" and ""incarnate insult to the English language"" is Eliza Doolittle, who is outraged and insulted by Higgins' arrogant, patronizing attitude to her, but she does dream of a better life, being able to open up a flower shop and being able to afford chocolates-hence her desire to speak more genteel.
Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), a veteran soldier posted in India who studied the languages there, treats Eliza like a lady rather than a flower girl, and is by far the more gentlemanly of the men.  This point is driven home when Eliza tells Higgins that the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she's treated.  And Higgins is at times impatient, frustrated, but treats her more as an experiment than a human being.
A daunting task it is, as Eliza finds it difficult to turn her long i's into a's and to add her ""h's.""  But when she finally does, it's a triumph, which leads to the back to back ebullience of ""The Rain in Spain"" and ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" with Hepburn's singing voice done by Marni Nixon.
The concepts of classes division is seen in Higgins' opening number, when he wonders why the English can't teach their children how to speak.  He notes how the way one Englishman speaks makes another Englishman despise him, where the nobility look down on the working class, and the working class become fed up with the nose-in-the-air attitude of the upper classes.  A universal manner of speaking so that there will be no class conflict would be nice, but I'd sure miss that chirpy ""Cor blimey, gov"" from the docks.
Another is the Victorian distinction between men and women, in Higgins' ""Let A Woman In Your Life"" number.  Men had more independence than women then, and Higgins is able to do what he wants.  In marriage, the man is tying the knot all right...around his own neck.  And speaking of marriage, it's clearly a bourgeois concept.  Once a man has enough money and standing, he has certain social responsibilities.  This is demonstrated in Eliza's father Alfred Doolittle, a working class dustman who hasn't married her stepmother.  Stan Holloway reprised his role as Alfred from the stage version.
Audrey Hepburn's talents really come forth via her brash and loud Cockney accent, and for this she worked with phonetics professor Peter Ladefoged at USC in LA.  She is effervescent throughout, whatever costume she wears;  and as for that smile, it's magical.  And for Rex Harrison to have worked opposite Julie Andrews in a film version would've yielded a carbon copy of the stage version.  Working with Hepburn, his performance was more challenging and spirited, and hence his Best Actor Oscar.
Indeed, it won eight Oscars, including three of the big four-actor (Rex Harrison), director (George Cukor) and picture.  Unfortunately, its loss to Best Actress was the most conspicuous, as Audrey Hepburn ironically lost to Julie Andrews, the stage version of Eliza.  And Cecil Beaton's costume designs was another deserved win, not only for Eliza's white Ascot dress and hat, but for the ballroom scene as well.
This is one of Hepburn's best vehicles, along with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Charade, How To Steal A Million, and Wait Until Dark.",1081123200,6,3680,4.93517017828201

Warner wanted Cary Grant as Prof. Henry Higgins but Grant declined, giving the studio boss no choice but to cast Rex Harrison in the lead - an inspired choice since Rex had already made the part his own on Broadway. The unfortunate oversight is that Jack Warner couldn't see Julie Andrews true potential beneath her common frumpery of the cockney flower girl. So in stepped Audrey Hepburn - delightful, charming, outstanding...alas, she couldn't sing! Her vocals - dubbed by Marni Nixon, became the subject of controversy that cost Audrey her Best Actress Oscar nomination. That went to Julie Andrews for ""Mary Poppins"". So did the win!

809308,5,630417893X,"I really, truly hope that the success of MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO will help revive the musical.  Many of the first sound films ever made were musicals, and there is no obvious reason why they went away.  Moreover, there is a wealth of musical talent among actors today.  Kevin Spacey and Hugh Jackman, for instance, are enormously talented, and Mandy Patinkin is a major stage musical talent, yet has never been able to make a film musical.
All of which is to say, films like MY FAIR LADY should be made again.  Perhaps not this particular kind of story, but a musical more akin to the needs and tastes of the early 21st century.
MY FAIR LADY is a great, great screen musical, but it could have been even better, and it almost was made a lot worse.  The production itself is superb, striking just the right tone and atmosphere throughout, and one has to love the set and art design.  But the film was subject to a number of bizarre casting decisions.  The most famous surrounded Audrey Hepburn rather than Julie Andrews being cast as Eliza Doolittle.  I am tremendously conflicted by this.  On the one hand, I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, and I love her work in this film.  Although for the most part her singing was dubbed by the incomparable Marni Nixon (it is fascinating to hear the outtakes of Hepburn's own singing, which, while not up to the level of Nixon's, was much, much better than Natalie Wood's singing in WEST SIDE STORY, which Nixon also dubbed), she acted her role superbly, and it is hard for me to imagine anyone else playing the role.  On the other hand, Julie Andrews did originate the role, and while the studio didn't want her in the film because she wasn't a star.  Ironically, Andrews would in the same year make MARY POPPINS, and be nominated for and win the Oscar for Best Actress.  Audrey Hepburn would not even be nominated, and many feel that this was payback for the studio not giving the role to Andrews, who clearly had earned the right to the part.  Still, I can't say that casting Audrey Hepburn was a mistake.  (Interestingly, Julie Andrews and Marni Nixon would appear together shortly afterwards in THE SOUND OF MUSIC, with Nixon playing a Nun.)
More perplexing, however, were other casting deliberations.  It seems inconceivable that anyone other than Rex Harrison could play Henry Higgins, yet the studios considered other actors.  Among many others, Cary Grant and George Sanders were both considered for the film.  Grant was actually quite a good singer, and although he never made film musicals, had performed in a number of musical productions before entering the movies.  Still, the thought of Grant singing versus Harrison's inimitable spoken performances of his songs does not make one wish Grant had gotten the role.  Harrison is so perfect that one imagines his playing the role an act of fate.  Almost as amazing is the fact that Warner Brothers contemplated having James Cagney play Alfred P. Doolittle rather than Stanley Holloway, who played the role on Broadway.  Again, I love Cagney, but the role belongs to Holloway.  Having anyone else star in the role would have lessened the film.
So, in the end, while one might feel regret that Julie Andrews was left out of the production (though paradoxically happy that Audrey Hepburn was included), the cast of MY FAIR LADY ended up close to perfect.

Hepburn's character is a rough, street girl from the bad part of London. Professor Henry Higgins sees her as a project, not as a human being. It's the old class warfare scenario.
Professor's associates are somewhat more compassionate than Higgins. In the end we're not sure whether the old man has changed his ways or not.
The sets, music, writing, plot all enter into the mix of making this the classic it is. This is one of those films people watched over and over because it has the potential of being a pleasant addiction.",1067558400,2,669,4.583333333333333

809311,5,630417893X,"I would like to make a correction to one of the well-written ""My Fair Lady"" reviews appearing here.  Audrey Hepburn was NOT nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Eliza Doolittle.  The nominees for Best Actress of 1964 were Julie Andrews, Anne Bancroft, Sophia Loren, Debbie Reynolds, and Kim Stanley.  Hepburn's name was conspicuously and inexplicably absent from the nominees' list.  And even though Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed, her performance was certainly Oscar worthy.
As the inelegant Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, who is transformed into a poised and graceful lady by the cantankerous Professor Henry Higgins (portrayed by Rex Harrison), Hepburn was sublime.  Hepburn captured all of Eliza's fierce determination, intelligence, heartache, and romanticism in a perfectly modulated performance.  I believe that it is one of the best performances by any actress in the movies.
But there was an undeserved backlash against Hepburn.  Certain members of the Motion Picture Academy were adamant that Julie Andrews (the original Eliza Doolittle on Broadway) should have reprised her role in the movie version of ""My Fair Lady"".  But Hepburn was a film veteran with proven box office appeal.  That was the reason Jack Warner chose her to play Eliza over Andrews in his expensive production of ""My Fair Lady"".  Andrews rebounded with an Oscar win for her role as Mary Poppins, so there was justice for Andrews in the end.  And who could blame Hepburn for wanting to play one of the greatest roles ever written for an actress in Eliza Doolittle?  Shaw's heroine was certainly well-served by Hepburn's gifts as an actress.
This cinematic version of ""My Fair Lady"" is skillfully directed by the respected veteran, George Cukor.  The photography, costumes, and sets are stunningly beautiful.  Alan Jay Lerner's witty libretto based on Shaw's ""Pygmalion"" remains intact as does the rapturous, lilting score by Frederick Loewe.

The enchanting story is back, and this time it will stay.  The part of Higgins played by the great Rex Harrison is brought to life by intricate acting.  Harrison played the part on broadway, and since he didn't ""sing"" well, he talked the lyrics of the songs to pitches.  He brought this same style to the big screen.  Hepburn wasn't the first choice of the producers (it was Julie Andrews, who could sing her own part, but was already in Mary Poppins), but Hepburn became Eliza Doolitle, and it was one of her most renouned performances.  She was nominated for oscar in this performance, but wasn't given the honor since her singing was dubbed (a travesty, and mistake by the academy).

The dubbing is disgraceful as Audreys mouth doesn't match Marni Nixons voice hardly and when they are meant to be celebrating Eliza's new upper class accent we only got a few seconds of Audreys voice change before Marni jumps in with a rather pathetic and limp version of ""The Rain In Spain.""With this DVD you hear Audreys voice for the first time on its own singing Wouldn't it be loverly and Show me. She sounds like a frghtened horse!
I suggest you by this DVD to see Rex take over your screen as
the big headed, selfish, arrogant and cool Henry Higgins.  The relationship with his mother is funny. Also if you like the songs DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT buy the film soundtrack unless you want to hear Marni Nixon wailing through these classic numbers and Rex Harrisons modified Henry Higgins numbers, buy the original broadway production, or to you and me the Julie Andrews one as not only do the songs sound show stopping performed by Ms. Andrews and also i find that her numbers sound strong and powerful compared to the movies versions but Rex Harrisons voice is alot more louder and clearer and mutch better as he seems to get Henry down to a ""cup, then say of, then say cup cup cup cup cup cup of of of of TEA!""",1059609600,,1844,4.452662721893491

My one complaint, Warner Brothers didn't own the rights to ""More Loverly Than Ever"" a fascinating documentary on the making and restoration of My Fair Lady that was included on the deluxe laserdisc box set put out by CBS/Fox back in the early 90's.  This is a companion piece that is essential to appreciating the film as a true work of art and if Warner knows what's good (and they most certainly have proven that they do indeed) they should make every effort to acquire the documentary and revisit this title at a later date in a 2-disc special edition.

809315,5,630417893X,"Based upon the hit play ""Pygmalian"" by George Bernard Shaw and directed by George Cukor, the 1964 film ""My Fair Lady"" is a masterpiece of story, song and script that earned 8 Oscars and a total of 12 Oscar nominations in 1965.  The film stars Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, Rex Harrison (who won the Oscar for Best Actor) as Professor Henry Higgins, Stanley Holloway (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as Eliza's father Alfred P. Doolittle, Wilfred Hyde-White as Colonel Hugh Pickering and Gladys Cooper (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress) as Henry's mother Mrs. Higgins.
Set in London circa 1900, Henry Higgins is an internationally renowned professor of the English language.  While leaving a show one evening, Henry meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, who planned to meet with Henry and vice versa.  After being interrupted by a poor young woman (Eliza Doolittle) selling flowers and who has a dreadful accent, Henry begins a discourse on the defilement of the English language and how one can identify an individual's origins through their accent and dialect. Eliza, of course, is insulted.  Henry and Colonel Pickering leave for Henry's home, but Eliza thinks seriously about a proposal that Henry said in jest: that he could teach Eliza how to speak properly and improve her station in life.  The following morning, Eliza (who overheard where Henry lives) arrives at his front door.  After coming in, she asks Henry to give her English lessons that she'll pay for.  He initially rejects the idea, but changes his mind with the assistance of Colonel Pickering.  Eliza is whisked away upstairs by his maid, Mrs. Pearce (Mona Washbourne), to be cleaned.  A torment of screams ensues as Eliza is stripped naked and bathed.  Her tattered clothes are burned per Henry's orders, but new clothes are purchased for her.
Thus begins Eliza's training in the proper use of the English language through the skills of Henry Higgins.  Eliza sees Henry as an overbearing misogynist, but Henry sees himself as the exact opposite and he gets the opportunity of meeting Eliza's father Alfred.  Eliza learns over time, and a mutual love-hate relationship develops between her and Henry.
The numerous wonderful songs in the film were written by Frederick Loewe and directed by Andre Previn (who received the Oscar for Best Music Adaptation).  Audrey Hepburn did not get to sing in the film; instead, Marni Nixon dubbed her, as was Jeremy Brett (who played Eliza's would-be young suitor, Freddie Eynsford-Hill) by Bill Shirley.  The songs in the film include:
* ""Why Can't The English?"" (5+/5, Rex Harrison and Marni Nixon) In front of the opera house.
* ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" (5+/5, Marni Nixon) In front of the opera house.
* ""I'm An Ordinary Man"" (5/5, Rex Harrison) At Henry's home, after Eliza comes.
* ""With A Little Bit Of Luck"" (4.5/5, Stanley Holloway & ensemble) Eliza's father prior to meeting Henry.
* ""Just You Wait"" (5+/5, Marni Nixon) Eliza angry with Henry.
* ""Servant's Chorus"" (4.5/5 ensemble) Henry's servants lamenting him teaching Eliza.
* ""The Rain In Spain"" (4.5/5, Rex Harrison, Marni Nixon & Wilfred Hyde-White) Eliza finally getting a pronunication correct.
* ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" (5/5, Marni Nixon, Mona Washbourne & ensemble) Eliza excited over celebrations with Henry & Colonel Pickering.
* ""Ascot Gavot"" (4.5/5, ensemble) At the horse race.
* ""Ascot Gavot (Reprise)"" (4.5/5, ensemble) At the horse race.
* ""On The Street Where You Live"" (4/5, Bill Shirley) Freddie thinking of Eliza outside Henry's home.
* ""The Transylvanian March"" (4/5, instrumental) At the ball.
* ""The Embassy Waltz"" (4.5/5, instrumental) At the ball.
* ""You Did It"" (4.5/5, Wilfred Hyde-White, Rex Harrison & ensemble) Henry & Colonel Pickering congratulating themselves.
* ""Just You Wait (Reprise)"" (4.5/5, Marni Nixon) Eliza upset.
* ""On the Street Where you Live (Reprise)"" (4/5, Bill Shirley) Freddie still outside of Henry's home.
* ""Show Me"" (5/5, Marni Nixon and Bill Shirley) Eliza & Freddie leaving Henry's home together.
* ""The Flower Market"" (5/5, Marni Nixon) Back at the flower market.
* ""Get Me To The Church On Time"" (3.5/5, Stanley Holloway & ensemble) Alfred celebrating before his impending marriage.  The song is somewhat too long in my opinion.
* ""A Hymn To Him"" (5+/5, Rex Harrison & Wilfred Hyde-White) Henry extolling the virtues of men.
* ""Without You"" (5/5, Marni Nixon & Rex Harrison) Eliza putting Henry in his place.
* ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"" (5/5, Rex Harrison) Henry feeling alone.

But the movie! I know this is supposed to be the classic movie comparable to Sound of Music and Oklahoma, but I did not find it to be a very enjoyable movie. Yes, the songs were good. At times I had no IDEA how the lyric writers could rhyme the words so cleverly. The story plot was certainly a good one. There were a few surprise curse-words that I didn't expect: more than a dozen D-words - most coming in a rapid-fire salvo - and one use of the not-so-nice synonym for horse rear.
So what was my beef with the movie? How about IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ENDING? So after Eliza is passed off as the duchess, she finds that that's all she is needed for. Professor Higgins doesn't actually love her, as she supposed. So she leaves. Higgins has a talk with her, and decides he can live without her. And yet her face was ""like a second nature"" to him, so he pines after her after she's left. Then she comes back into his house and re-delivers a line she'd said at their first movie. And he says ""Eliza. Now where in the devil are my slippers?"" And ta-da! The movie ends! Right there. Did she stay, even after she'd blown up at him because he treated her like luggage? What about Higgins' friend Pickering? He made some sort of mysterious phone call, and departed from the scene, and we NEVER FOUND OUT WHY. In my English, they taught me that a good story has all the elements. Exposition, conflict, rising action, climax, resolution, and ending. This movie don't got no endin'.
The movie also winds around a little with rabbit-trails (like Mr. Doolittle's Getting Married in the Morning dance routine, which is totally out of place). It's also awfully long, and I found it hard to keep paying attention.
Yes, the songs are great fun. The dancing is okay. But I don't think I'll ever find just cause to watch this movie ever again.",1045958400,2,1988,4.3324396782841825

It is the classic story of Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), the Cockney-accented flower girl selling on the streets at Covent Garden, who'd rather be selling in the shops.
Professor Henry Higgins, played by Rex Harrison who won an Oscar for his performance in this picture, discovers her and her awful speaking skills and appearance, and boasts to her how he can make a duchess out of her. When she's taken in, it is a long drag trying to teach her how to speak correctly. When the time comes, the musical number in there is jubilant. The next day at the Ascot races, which features some of the most marvelous costumes ever, she makes her debut in the most famous outfit she wears in the film next to the ball gown. During the races when the horses pass, she hilariously shouts: ""Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' 'arse'!"" It becomes a shocker to everyone. Preparing for the embassy ball, and during so, the setting is spectacular! Feeling uncredited after the ball, she runs off to Covent Garden where no one recognizes her at all, and her father (Stanley Holloway) is ""getting married in the morning"". Eliza goes to Henry's mother's place as Higgins desparately searches for her in a big mass confrontation between the two, as she thinks she can do without him as she goes away. Henry marches home angry in a quite odd musical number how he can do without her, but he's ""grown accustomed to her face."" As he plays her voice on the gramophone, Eliza comes in and talks in her Cockney voice saying ""I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did."" Higgings looks up saying: ""Eliza? Where the devil are my slippers?"". The scene ends ther showing that she will stay with Higgins! Simply marvelous and ""loverly"" is ""My Fair Lady""!",1043539200,2,1857,4.596385542168675

809422,4,630417893X,"My Fair Lady stands as one of the great musicals of the post-MGM era, largely on the strength of the original play and it's cast. And it has aged well.
This is the role for which Rex Harrison will always be remembered. And if he's a bit old for the part, we are still lucky to be able to see the brilliance or his ""original"" Henry Higgins. He's obnoxious, prejudiced, and insufferably full of himself and the importance of the English language. Yet, he is touched and changed by Eliza. Stanley Hollaway also reprises his role of Alfred Doolittle with the deft touch of the music hall veteran that he was.
Audrey Hepburn, the Julia Roberts of her day, is radiant, vulnerable, and finally regal as Eliza. It is one of her best performances, and a wonderful use of her talents as an actress, dancer, and star. The only drawback to using her is that she is primarily a dancer rather than a singer - and Eliza is a singer's role. A problem that was famously (infamously?) solved by dubbing much of her singing. I disagree with those who find the dubbing obvious - all movie musicals are dubbed. The only difference is that most actors lip-synch to their own voice rather than someone else's. (If you want to be picky - Barbra Streisand has a much greater problem with syncing to a pre-recorded track in ""Funny Girl"" that Hepburn does here.)
As for the issue of Julie vs. Audrey - I think we are all lucky to have had the enjoyment of seeing (or hearing) both actresses play the role. I really wouldn't want to be without either. Just as different actors bring their own qualities and point of view to new interpretations of ""Hamlet"" - Eliza is a part that demands the best of a performer.
The team behind the camera makes great contributions. Harry Stradling Sr.'s cinematography is great mainstream sixties camera work. What it lacks in invention it makes up for in the beauty of the lighting and compositions. Cecil Beaton reprises his Broadway role of costume and production designer (along with Gene Allan). He designed for the previous Lerner and Lowe film ""Gigi"", and he set a new standard in this film - particularly with the costumes. As a matter of fact, George Cukor pretty much gives him the Ascott scene as a costume set piece. (Hepburn's dress alone is a testament to how costume builders can take a few squiggly lines from a designer and turn them into a real work of art in fabric and feathers.)
It seems, however, that director George Cukor clearly does not have much of a hand for musicals - he films the action very conservatively and with few cuts and camera movements. He treats the legendary Broadway show pretty much as if he was filming Shaw's play. This gives the film a stiffness and stodginess that sometimes makes you wonder why all this is taking so long. Contrast this work with Robert Wise's ""Sound of Music"" which opened a year later. ""Lady"" is clearly the stronger source material, yet ""Music"" floats on the energy of its score and Ernest Lehman's script.
But while Cukor's vision does not add much to the property, he gets out of the way and lets his actors and production team put on a first class rendition of the show.
My Fair Lady is still a wonderful evening's entertainment. The cast, the score, the story, the design are all first rate. If it lacks a little in imagination and pace, well that's a small price to pay for a piece of theatrical legend.",1032652800,2,3384,4.558292282430213

809487,5,630417893X,"I thought the music was wonderful.  I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch.  Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character.  My problem (a minor one) is with the ending and with the dubbing.
The story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy.  The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy, self-possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match.  And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl.  The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.
But there are some problems.  Freddy is needed of course as another ""objectifying"" character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing this--in theory, of course, because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza, this would seem entirely unnecessary.  And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful ""On the Street Where You Live.""  But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see, and indeed even at the resolution of the story, he still does not see, as he asks for his slippers.  If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written.  Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!
The dubbing and the need for it is curious.  There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious?  It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience: they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained.  And so Hepburn does not completely lip-sync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing.  And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious.  Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage.  Still, as another reviewer has so acutely noted, if she had been asked, we would have missed her in Mary Poppins, which was made the same year.  I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made (although she looked almost ten years younger).  Nonetheless she was playing the part of ""a good girl, I am,"" whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.
Curious.  But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part.  I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice.  By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she ""meow's"" Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing.  (Get the CD.)
This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor.  The sets and production numbers are gorgeous.

The dvd has a cool feature where you get to hear Hepburn's actual voice in two songs and it makes you wonder why they felt the need to dub; however, it was the way of the time the movie was made.  I guess it's tough to compete with the voice of Julie Andrews, but looking at it from contemporary thought, I believe the combination of Hepburn's voice and acting ability would have really withstood all the criticism in not having Andrews play the role.  Hepburn's acting performance is just fantastic, and she really deserves all the praise for being one of the finest actresses in film history.  Place this performance with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, two for the road, wait until dark, breakfast at tiffanys... and you have quite the actress.

Rex Harrison is masterful as Henry Higgins, and Audrey Hepburn does a delightful job as Liza Doolittle.  A film that still has appeal and charm after almost 40 years!...",1024876800,,244,4.627906976744186
809490,5,630417893X,"This is one of the few movies I've seen that I actually liked better than the book (Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion) even though the book was also good. Henry Higgins(Rex Harrison), a rich bachelor with an obsession for language, makes a bet that he can transform Eliza Doolittle(Audrey Hepburn), a poor girl who lives on the streets and has terrible language skills, into a fine, well-spoken lady. Eliza begs him to teach her how to speak properly because of her desire to move away from her low class stature. Eventually her speaking skills become so good, that she is mistaken for royalty by a noted specialist in language(Theodore Bikel) and becomes envy of all the ladies and the desire of all the men(this is during the ball scene, one of the best and most exquisite parts of the movie). What makes this movie so marvelous is the actors and the music.
The casting in My Fair Lady is perfect. Audrey Hepburn is not only gorgeous as a proper lady, but also amazing(not to mention very funny) as a commoner; she plays the role of a poor girl with bad upbringing flawlessly-the way she talks and carries herself are right on. Rex Harrison is also spectactular in the role of Henry Higgins and the two of them together have great on-screen chemistry. Both of them are dynamic characters who learn from their experiences and change accordingly throughout the entire film. My favorite character of all is Alfred Doolittle(Stanley Holloway). Holloway is hilarious as Alfie, Eliza's cockney father. The other, minor characters are also well-casted.
The most appealing thing about My Fair Lady is the music. ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" is probably the most well-known song from this movie and also the greatest. Another notable song include ""On the Street where you Live"", sung by Eliza's admirer, Freddy(Jeremy Brett). There are many additional songs that are famous in the movie including ""Wouldn't it be loverly?"", ""Get me to the church on time"" and several others.
The DVD itself has a few good features-a commentary by the art director, and a featurette about the costumes, makeup, etc. Not the greatest set of DVD features, but they are still not too bad, considering the fact that this movie was made nearly forty years ago. This is definitely one of the best movies I own-one I know I will probably end up watching over and over again. It's no wonder My Fair Lady won Best Picture(and many other Oscars) the year it was made-it has superb acting, beautiful costumes, terrific music, and also a mixture of comedy and romance.",1024704000,,2525,4.8068965517241375

809493,5,630417893X,"When cinephiles go to heaven, most will rush straight for the projection room screening the original cuts of 'The Magnificent Ambersons' and 'The Red Badge Of Courage'.  Of course, so will I , but first I'll take a peek at the 'restored' version of 'My Fair Lady', the one in which dubmeistress Marni Nixon's blandly functional singing is replaced by Audrey Hepburn's own, her limited, hesitent, fragile voice infinitely more moving and appropriate to her role as Eliza Doolittle, the flowergirl taken from the gutter by the gentleman-phonetician Henry Higgins, who places a bet with fellow linguist Colonel Pickering that he can pass her off as gentry at an Embassy Ball.  The true, tantalising joy of this DVD, surpassing anything in the film itself, is its footage of Audrey's audition singing, which was deemed inadequate for the soulless pageant planned by Jack Warner, but now quivering with all the haunted pathos, yearning, grace, wit and rapture of which only Audrey was capable.  Although I think it is more defensible thematically and visually than its detractors allow, 'Lady' would still be a mechanical bore were it not for the performance of Audrey.  Famously and contentiously, Julie Andrews, the original stage Eliza, was dropped because she wasn't a star name, and even today, many regret that decsion.  But 'Lady' moves precisely because it is an Audrey Hepburn picture, one of those duckling-blooming-into-duchess roles essential to her.  Andrews may have been broadly convincing as a Cockney guttersnipe, but there is no way she could have pulled off the regal elegance required for part two.  Because director Cukor rightly disdains realism, it doesn't matter that Audrey's impersonation of a Cockney is a failure - what matters is that the audience knows the actress is the acme of aristocratic refinement, and is willing to undergo the exquisite torture of seeing those precious features and that precious voice grotesquely distorted for the ephiphanic pleasure of seeing them as if rising from the dead.  The fact that Audrey's own beautiful English was inflected by her Dutch background gives her a 'foreigness' that further adds to her alienation.  And Andrews could never have captured the sadness or vulnerabilty that lay just beneath Audrey's self-possessed chic, qualities that see Shaw's brittle comedy crack into tragedy - witness her appearance on top of Higgins' stairs on the night of the ball, in off-white and noose-like pearls, descending with all the melancholic majesty of a dying swan, donning a clostral velvet cape as if condemning herself to a nunnery.  After the broad pantomime of the Covent Garden sequences and the rollicking celebrations around 'The Rain In Spain', the contrast is almost too much to bear, and Higgins' once hysterical jibes wound like the most brutal of blows.
'Lady' is dismissed by 'serious' film fans as the last lumbering dinosaur of an already fossilised studio system.  Certainly, the film is a failure as a musical - I don't believe for a moment the legendary Herme Pan had anything to do with the stillborn choreography; and the the switches from drama to music are ungainly.  Any attempt to frame complex shots or even move the camera seem to have been blocked by the heavy decor.  Viewed as a George Cukor film, however, and 'Lady' is a triumph.  It is a film that insists upon its own rigid artifice and theatricality (brilliantly freezing into anti-illusionistic tableaux, or breaking into undiegetic choral commentary) to recreate a social system in which human beings ossified like mannequins, or mummies in a museum; the construction of all human interaction ('language', class, gender) is meticulously analysed.  For all its lavish production values, this is not a film to wallow in - it has a hard, flat, stark, grey, often ugly look.  The cold, Higgins-like brilliance of Shaw's only readable play is tempered by the humanising of Eliza, while the cultural milieu from which it sprang is contextualised to add layers of meaning - Holmes is like Sherlock Holmes, an eecentric bachelor genius with slightly dimmer sidekick and loyal housekeeper, who can 'read' the unmanagable city and its inhabitants by (verbal) clues; like a HG Wells mad professor, he uses the latest scientific gadgetry in his 'laboratory' to create a new human being; the relationship between Higgins and Pickering has all the epigrammatic homosociability of Wilde, while the presence of the Transylvanian Queen and predatory males invokes another fellow Irishman, Bram Stoker.  In fact, it is only when unalloyed Shaw intrudes - for instance Alfred Doolittle's tiresome paradoxes about 'middle-class morality' - that the film threatens to stall.  Perhaps the real subject of the film, cued in the budding flowers of the opening titles, is Eliza's sexuality, potentially deviant and disruptive, and often suspect to accusations of vice, which must be controlled for more 'respectable' barter.  She is a kind of wild child, an animalistic savage who must be 'tamed' by benevolent Imperialists like the gentleman scholar and the Raj officer.
Alan Jay Lerner's unfailingly witty book is a vast improvement on the original, and the songs are such a delight that straight filming of the musical would be pleasure enough.  Each character and mood has its own type of music - Higgins declaims in Gilbert&Sullivan-type patter-song, especially in those two classes of misogyny 'But Let A woman In Your Life...' and 'Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man'; Alfred's Victorian working-class pub singalongs; Freddie's sappy operetta; and, most treasurably, Eliza's lyric rapture, soaring with 'I Could Hae Danced All Night', curdling into the Grand Guignol of 'Just You Wait, 'enry 'iggins', in which she fantasises murdering her tormentor.",1021852800,14,5783,5.191192266380236
809494,5,630417893X,"This is one of my favorite musicals, along with 1776. It takes its plot from Shaw's Pygmalion and does a terrifc job of turning a Broadway hit into a big-screen smash.
Whereas Shaw's play was an indictment of society's tendency to place birth above ability, the movie gently ignores that aspect to focus on the relationship between Higgins and Dolittle. Dr. Higgins is a noted linguist who believes that speech is the only thing that seperates us from the animals and if a person could use speech properly, that person could rise to the top of society, ignoring birth and upbringing. He attempts to prove is theory by taking Eliza Dolittle, Hepburn, an unwashed flower peddler from lower London, into his home to teach her etiquette and proper speech. His teaching transforms Eliza who becomes the rage of London society. Eliza falls for Higgins is is blissfully unaware of his feelings ntil she leaves. She returns to a happy ending.
Rex Harrison is perfect as the pompous, self-satisfied, insensitive Professor Higgins. His performance is unsurpassed except for Audrey Hepburn. Her performance is one of her most brilliant and a star in her crown of achievement.
The movie glosses over some of the play's biting satire, softening it, as when Higgins laments about why a woman can't be more like a man or when Eliza complains that, after her transformation, she can no longer work for a living but must be married off to a rich husband but Higgins says she can get a job in a dress boutique.

""My Fair Lady"". Thats all one needs to say to get the attention of millions. But who is locked in the public's mind as Eliza Dootlittle?: Dame Julie Andrews. Deservedly so. She took Broadway by storm in My Fair Lady. Making covers of ""Life"" Magazine and more in 1956 etc. No one-and i mean no one (that includes Audrey Hepburn) should have been allowed to destory the Eliza that Julie created. Jack Warner destroyed Eliza buy hiring Audrey Hepburn. Ofcourse we all know it didn't hurt Ms. Andrews' career. She got a LITTLE gig called ""Mary Poppins""...I'm sure NONE OF YOU have heard of it, right? And then a tiny little thing called ""the sound of music"" only the most popular movie of all time. AND she got her Oscar for Best Actress for Mary Poppins. Go, Julie! She showed them. Even Jack Warner admitted that he voted for Julie Andrews in the Academy Awards. ANd It has been said by MORE than a few that ""passing up Julie Andrews for Eliza ruined Jack's career and was the worst move he ever made"". Audrey Hepburn was a terribly weak Eliza Doolittle. And thet world knows it--come on, admit it. Most of you have heard the Julie Andrews version from the my fair lady broadway cd 9or the lndon cast, ms. andrews did both) and it is SO true that she was much better. her accent is way believable. ANd her singing voice is unmatchable. (four and a half octaves--which is more than i can say about Audrey's dubber Marni Nixon). Well, Rex Harrison was wonderful on the upside. He pleaded with Jack Warner to use Julie. But, now that i think of it no one ""uses"" MY julie. They can ""use"" her talent, yes. of which she has much. but julie makes her own desicions. and when jack warner asked her to reprise her Broadway role of Guenvere in the movie version Camelot, after a long process of thought (and because Richard Burton and Robert Goulet, who lpayed oppisite her on Broadway had both declinded) she said ""No."" GO, Julie! Atleast Jack had the sense to ask the real Queen to be the queen in his movie. I guess he didn't wanna make the mistake he made with my fair lady again, huh? Yup.
If we were in 1964 right now. If i were to go back in time. I would have barged into jack's office and screamed my lungs out until he promised to fire Audrey. :) innocent little me. but it is well known that Julie's career outlasted Audrey's. Yup-yup. For Julie is still decking out major movie hits as we speak--and Audrey well, I loved her in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" and may she rest in peace. From what i know, which is a lot when it comes to julie andrews, Audrey and Julie got along famously. Now don't get me wrong. I don't HATE Audrey, she was just very wro0ng for the part. I like Audrey very much. not NEARLY as much as i love julie andrews but...i think the world agrees when i say that its much easier to fall in love with mary poppins than holly goliightly whom ONLY ""Fred"" REALLY loved with all his heart. Julie just has that efffect on people that audrey doesnt possess. well, we cant have it all can we? We've got ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound Of Music"" so soften the blow. If Julie had done My Fair lady, she WOULD have been able to do Mary Poppins but she WOULDNT have been able to do ""The Americanization Of Emily"" or ""The Sound Of Music"". and let's face it, Can anyone here actually imagine ""The Sound Of Music"" with anyone BUT Julie ANdrews?

Every element of this movie works, from its sumptuous photography by veteran cameraman Harry Stradling, to the glorious costumes and sets created by Cecil Beaton.  The music is incomparable.  Frederick Loewe's melodies are lovely and infectious and Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics are every bit as witty and touching as the dialogue originally written by playwright George Bernard Shaw for ""Pygmalion"".  ""My Fair Lady"" is the musical version of ""Pygmalion"".
The transformation of the illiterate, unwashed Eliza Doolittle into the breathtaking ""Fair Lady"" of the film's title is inspiring to see.  This is one of Audrey Hepburn's best roles, and she is perfection as Eliza Doolittle.  She is thoroughly convincing as the Cockney flower girl who transcends her humble roots to end up dancing with a prince at an embassy ball. Hepburn expertly translates Eliza's tenacity, vulnerbility, intelligence, and grace into a beautiful and timeless performance.
Yes, it's true that Julie Andrews (who created the original Eliza on Broadway) was bypassed for this role.  However, this was purely a business decision made by studio head Jack Warner.  He did not want to risk such a lavish, expensive production on a relative newcomer such as Andrews was at the time.  So he went with the safe bet, Hepburn, as Eliza Doolittle.  Audrey was an established star with a great track record.
But Andrews soon recovered from this disappointment to make two blockbusters of her own, ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Sound of Music"".  Not a bad trade-off I'd say.

Audrey Hepburn (""Breakfast at Tiffiny's"", ""The Nun's Story"") is perfect for the role of Eliza Dolittle. From her accent as a flower seller, all the way to the beauty of the grand ball, she plays this role as if it's who she is. Rex Harrison (Doctor Dolittle) plays Professor Higgins, as he did in the Broadway musical. He has become the only person we could ever see in this role, as well as the first person who comes to mind when thinking about this film.
The only criticism I have for this film is concerning the music. Hepburn, while I beautiful actress, is a TERRIBLE singer. Knowing this fact, the director casted someone to sing all of Hepburn's songs for her. The lip-sinking is pretty bad on some of the songs, the most noticable being on the song 'I Could Have Danced All Night' where Hepburn is not ever CLOSE to being in sink with the song. On the song 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely', the singer's voice comes out with a slightly different accent that Hepburn had. These are very slight flaws; you would only notice them if you were looking for them.

It is an odd movie in that it brings both the stereotypical liberal and conservative messages to the table.... hammering half of those messages and supporting the other half. Funky, huh?
The linguists and poetics in this engaging musical will pull in the most erudite bookworm, without insulting the less avid reader.
Based on George Bernand Shaw's famous play, ""Pygmalion"", which, in turn, is based on a famous myth about the love between Pygmalion and Galatea, is thoroughly literary. Charged with archetypal questions, it does not preach, but shows what it wants to say, letting the viewer decide.
OK... I'm done with all that intellectual hoity-toity stuff...
Audrey Hepburn is incredible, showing us that classic beauty is more than a smile. Effervescent and light, she tells us ""The rain in Spain..."" You know the rest. Whether she is a Hungarian princess or a flower-selling street girl, she shines with glamour and dignity.
Harrison, likewise, is grand as linguist of world-wide proportions. He delivers his lines with delectable articulancy, taking on hard monologues as if they were children's verses.
Love is defined here awkwardly... is it because they are used to each other, need each other, attracted to each other? Is it because they are unimaginably incapable of living their lives without each other? Love is never as simple in real life as it is often protrayed: but not here! You'll soak in the full breadth of love's complexities.

809544,4,630417893X,"This great musical is not without controversy. The snubbing of Julie Andrews in favor of the elegant but less-tuneful Audrey Hepburn is still a source of debate. George Cukor felt more comfortable with the famous Audrey, who wasn't allowed to sing but cleaned up nicely as Eliza Doolittle, flower seller urchin turned faux duchess. But Ms Andrews showed her Oscar-winning stuff in Mary Poppins (same year, can you believe it?) and certainly could dress for success as she showed later in Victor, Victoria. So we are left wondering what My Fair Lady would have been like with the unforgettable voice of Andrews.
That may be the only weakness, however. After all these years, the sets, the otherwise superb cast, the glorious costumes and above all, Lerner and Lowe's matchless score are still magical. If you are a costume buff, check out the incredible skill used to stage the Ascot Racing Day scene.

809581,5,630417893X,"If you are reading this review I am going to assume you already are a fan of this musical. Audrey Hepburn Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway are unforgettable. If you have somehow missed the film this is a musical even people who don't like musicals will be won over by. I had not seen the film for many years but I have been buying and playing a lot of DVDs as I purchased a projector this year.  My Fair Lady is one of the truly great experiences I have had with the DVD.  If you are trying to select DVDs that excel in both picture and sound and supplemental features you should include this film in your collection.  This DVD version of My Fair Lady is far and away the best ever released.  It has been painstakingly and lovingly restored to near perfection. The supplemental commentaries on the disc are fascinating and discuss the restoration process at length.  This is one commentary where I really felt educated about cinematography specialized techniques.  Having seen this film I watched David Lean's restored version of Lawrence of Arabia and I could really tell they didn't put as much into the restoration as this film.  I am no expert  but felt like one after listening to the supplemental materials.  The picture in my room is ten feet diagonal so I can really see flaws. This disc is near perfection. The colors are rich and vibrant and show the subtle details of all the costumes. Particular attention was made to not lose the details in the blacks and bright whites of the costumes.  I am frequently a little disappointed with the Surround Sound on many films but this fills the room with lush magnificent sound that is just spectacular.  If you want a disc that shows off both your sound and video system this is gold. Especially if you want to have something to play your parents will enjoy as most of the really good films to show off are in the sci fi genre.  The real reason to buy this disc is it is fabulous entertainment.

809614,5,630417893X,"So says the stuffy, but tough, Professor Henry Higgins (Best Actor Oscar-winner Rex Harrison) as the tired, but enchanting, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) manages to speak proper English. Winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, MY FAIR LADY proves that there is still plenty of life in musicals. Created by British playwright George Bernard Shaw under the original title, ""Pygmalion,"" we look into the lives of a phonetics teacher as his quest of turning a Cockney flower girl into a beautiful woman of Edwardian England. Distributed by Warner Bros., produced by studio head Jack L. Warner, directed by ""woman's director"" George Cukor (Best Director), this film was a winner from the start! With a cast of British players including Stanley Holloway (Best Supporting Actor nominee) as Eliza's sneaky father Alfred P. Doolittle, Gladys Cooper (Best Supporting Actress nominee) as Higgins's snooty society mother Mrs. Higgins, Wilfrid Hyde-White as the kind Colonel Hugh Pickering, Mona Washbourne as the gentle Mrs. Pearce, Theodore Bikel as the bothersome Zoltan Karpathy, and the handsome Jeremy Brett as the lovelorn Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
The musical numbers are, of course, fantastic! From ""Wouldn't It Be Lovely"" to ""With A Little Bit O' Luck"" to ""Just You Wait"" to ""I Could've Danced All Night,"" you find yourself singing and dancing along with the characters. The numbers rival those of other Oscar-winning musicals such as AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, THE KING AND I, GIGI, and WEST SIDE STORY. Though, Hepburn was dubbed by ""Hollywood's favorite dubbed"" Marni Nixon (who also dubbed Deborah Kerr in THE KING AND I, Leslie Caron in GIGI, and Natalie Wood in WEST SIDE STORY) ,  you still feel the passion given by those being dubbed. The serene look on Hepburn's face when she sings ""I Could've Danced All Night,"" for instance, is a wonderful example of forgetting the dubber and concentrating on the person on screen, namely Hepburn. The other dubbed actor is Jeremy Brett (Freddy), dubbed by Bill Shirley. Whoever Bill Shirley is, he is wonderful (with a rippling Butterscotch voice to boot). Rumor had it that Audrey Hepburn was an excellent singer, though Jack Warner must not have had enough confidence in her to pull it off.
That is very much like the casting of Eliza herself. Played on Broadway by incomparable Julie Andrews (who won an Oscar that same year for MARY POPPINS, her revenge in a way), people were against Hepburn playing Eliza. According to Warner himself, he didn't want an unknown actress playing a film role. I think that was dumb on Warner's part, especially since Andrews won an Oscar and, of course, starring in next year's Best Picture winner THE SOUND OF MUSIC!  But, Hepburn did a great job -- though the accent was a bit shaky in the beginning.
In conclusion, with 13 nominations and 8 wins, MY FAIR LADY brought out a classical film that inspired and touched people everywhere. And don't forget the film's competition: Stanley Kubrick's DR STRANGLOVE, Walt Disney's MARY POPPINS, Michael Cacoyannis's ZORBA THE GREEK, and Peter Glenville's BECKET. A major boost for Warner Bros. sagging weight at the box office and a major stepping stone for the Hollywood musical!

Warner), BEST DIRECTOR (George Cukor), BEST ACTOR (Rex Harrison), BEST COLOR ART DIRECTION/SET DECORATION (Gene Allen, George James Hopkins, and Cecil Beaton) and BEST COLOR COSTUME DESIGN (Cecil Beaton, creating a first in film history by winning both categories in one night), BEST COLOR CINEMATOGRAPHY (Harry Stradling), BEST MUSICAL ADAPTATION (Andre Previn), and BEST SOUND (George R.

809615,2,630417893X,"This is a sumptuous production, with glorious costumes, production design,sound, and Rex Harrison as the Professor. What makes this a freakish musical to me is that the leading lady can't even sing. She's dubbed. All the way through you see poor Audrey Hepburn pouring her heart out as she pretends to mimic the lyrics. Dubbing the singing voices of stars is hardly new. Ava Gardner was dubbed in ""Showboat"", although her voice was perfect (as the pre-recordings prove). But then Ava wasn't the real focus of attention in ""Showboat."" kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel were and oh, man could they sing. Audrey Hepburn was chosen only because at that time she was an old-fashioned ""Star!"" The old studio system demanded that only a real ""STar!"" should star in a stupendous musical like ""My Fair Lady."" Audrey was reportedly heart-broken Oscar ignored her. Why? Because there were other people besides me who thought it bizarre that an entire musical was built around a performer who couldn't sing a note. Julie Andrews proved that she could not only sing in Mary Poppins but that she had that shimmering star quality that only a few possess.  Those who heard Andrey Hepburn sing in real life said it was best the paying public didn't hear her. She had zero singing talent.",982195200,2,1268,4.84331797235023

I love absolutely everything about it: the songs, the acting, the exsquisite costumes, beautiful sets, the delightful humor and the brilliant acting. This movie defines what great musicals are all about. Audrey Hepburn, what can I say. She played the role of the coarse and unrefined flower girl Eliza Dolittle to absolute perfection. The way she played the role was so convincing and the way she could grasp that cockney accent was sheer brilliance. Rex Harrison as the role of the bitter and sexist pig Professor Higgins, was amazing. I must say that not only is he sexy but his acting proved to be nothing more than perfect. Rex and Audrey make a terrific team in this movie, they really shine. My Fair Lady how sweet it is!",981504000,,810,4.631944444444445
809617,5,630417893X,"The opening scenes of the rain-drenched cobblestone roads and theatrical backdrop lend a stage feel to a film adaptation of the Lerner & Loewe musical. Since it was based on George Bernard Shaw's 1913 play ""Pygmalion"", you won't mind the occasional ""stage"" echoes. In fact, that adds to the appeal.

We find Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) selling flowers and spewing out the most dreadful words in a Cockney accent. It is really almost unbearable, but don't turn the movie off as it doesn't last too long. Audrey Hepburn is perhaps the most beautiful actress to ever grace the screen in my humble opinion. Here, she shines and is only a wall flower for the first part of the movie. Later she blossoms into an exquisite woman who could win the heart of any man. It is truly her best acting.

Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and Colonel Pickering discover her selling flowers and after Professor Higgins throws money into her flower basket we expect the two will never meet again. Eliza has other ideas and proudly marches up to the professor's home and demands to be taught to speak like a lady.

Colonel Pickering then makes a bet with Professor Higgins and says that if he can turn this uncultured ""gutter snipe"" with a ""simply ghastly"" accent into a sophisticated, elegant duchess, he will pay for all the expenses. (Reminiscent of ""Trading Places"" to give a modern example) It is just irresistible to the professor and so he takes on a challenge for six months.

Higgins arrogant attitude will make you laugh. He is humerously as unaware of other's feelings as he is of his own. He is at first very unlikeable, yet made me laugh through the whole movie. You will enjoy his eccentric view of life and cunning attitude as he tempts Eliza with chocolates.

When you hear ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" you will know why this will become one of your favorite musicals. ""On the Street Where You Live"" always makes me cry.  The script is superb and humorous in so many places. you will find yourself crying, laughing, and becoming increasingly enchanted as the movie progresses. I love this line:

""The great secret in life is not a question of good manners or bad manners, or any particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls."" -Professor Higgins

Higgins and Eliza have quite a few passionate verbal exchanges which are quite amusing. Eliza says: ""I want a little Kindness"" and we immediately know that love is the only aspect missing from this relationship. Higgins has to learn to love and that to me is the undercurrent in this movie. While Eliza learns to speak well, Higgins learns to love well.

This unlikely romance is food for the soul. The ending is unpredictable and cute. The movie is sumptuously filmed and it is undeniable witty and sophisticated. The costumes and hair styles are the most elegant I have ever seen. If you enjoy ironic, intellectual comedy, be prepared to also fall in love with the most irresistible songs of all time. This enduring classic could not have been pulled off without Audrey Hepburn. No one could have played Henry Higgins like Rex Harrison!

There is a beauty about this movie which is just as eternal as love. You will want to own your own copy so you can watch it again and again. It has never lost its charm for me.

809618,5,630417893X,"but this one deserves them! This is probably the only movie that I could watch each night, and still laugh like crazy and sing along the tunes.
Based on G. B. Shaw's novel ""Pygmalion"", ""My Fair Lady"" is a musical that had a great success on Broadway, before George Cukor masterfully filmed it. All the actors, with no exception, are extraordinary. I would like to point out Rex Harrison's (aka prof. Henry Higgins) fantastic expressiveness, in every movement of his body and face.
You can tell the actors are doing a wonderful job, when you watch it for the 10th time, when you put each detail under the microscope of your hightened attention. You will notice that you have to laugh even harder, and that you have more and more fun each time you watch it.
The songs are beautiful and funny at the same time. Before you'll notice, you will be singing ""Lots o' chock'lit for me to eat..."", ""Just you wait 'enry 'iggins"" and ""The rain in Spain..."" and many others that will move forever in your heart and memories.
The DVD contains a full-lenght commentary packed with interesting details on the actors, the making, etc., and the singing voice of Eliza Doolittle (masterfully played by Audrie Hepburn), Marni Nixon, talks about some behind-the-scene events that I sure wasn't aware of. There is also a featurette and a very nice ""Making of.."" included.

Stylized enough to win the picture a rare  eight Academy Awards including 1964's Best Actor, Best Director, and the  coveted Best Picture. George Cukor directs the prodution with a trademark  flourish and wit that makes it an even greater pleasure to watch. Professor  Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison, in his Oscar-winning role) meets up with a  Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (a perfectly endearing and charming  Audrey Hepburn). Higgins makes a bet with his friend Colonel Pickering  (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that within six months he could pass the grubby  Cockney off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball. Eliza cannot resist Higgins'  offer, and he tutors her in the proper manner of society and speech. There  are some genuinely great scenes with Hepburn and Harrison during several  unorthodox speech exercises, which are very witty. The golden songs are  spectacular and still popular today, such as ""Wouldn't It Be  Loverly?"" and ""The Rain In Spain"" and ""I Could Have  Danced All Night"" among them.

Frederic Loewe's glorious music is perfectly complimented by Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics, as on the Broadway and London stages, and almost every song is memorable and great.  Second, the  gloriously witty script, filled with great lines, many taken directly from  Shaw, on whose play ""Pygmalion"" this was based, and sharp  commentary on Britain's class system.  Third, the all-around wonderful  performances, from Rex Harrison's arch, arrogant, gleeful Henry Higgins to  Audrey Hepburn's charming but unrefined flower girl who becomes a  sophisticated (and stunning-looking) lady, to Stanley Holloway's lovable  amoral father of Hepburn, to Wilfred Hyde-White's Colonel Pickering, to  Gladys Cooper's Mrs. Higgins, just as acerbic as her son.  Fourth, the  much-lauded stunning look of the film, with gorgeously stylized costumes by  Cecil Beaton and fine sets by Beaton.  All the ingredients are there for a  great film, and under George Cukor's direction, that's pretty much what you  get.
And yet, the film is noticably flawed.  Hepburn, while charming and,  of course, stunningly dressed, does not give a bad performance by any  means; it's just that she's not overwhemingly sympathetic.  And her voice  double, Marni Nixon, has a lovely voice, but doesn't really put any emotion  into her songs, forcing that ever-present question to re-emerge: Would  Julie Andrews, the Broadway and London Eliza, have been a better choice?  Also, Nixon and Hepburn really do not sound alike, which is slightly  annoying.  (Nevertheless, most of Nixon's songs, especially ""I Could  Have Danced All Night,"" do come off well, and if Andrews had been  cast, there'd be no ""Mary Poppins"")  ""On The Street Where  You Live,"" which I consider the best and most beautiful song in the  score, is given a rather flat reading by Bill Shirley, the voice double for  actor Jeremy Brett; it is the only song in the movie that is truly  forgettable, but that is Shirley's fault entirely, NOT Lerner or Loewe's.  Too bad.  And yes, the movie is a bit long.  But overall, it's a vastly  entertaining, enjoyable, romantic, and great experience, just not without  flaw.

Extremely witty and classic songs, a swish  script, and gorgeous costumes. Admittedly, it is eye candy, but what eye  candy! George Cukor directs it with true aplomb, turning  ""Titanic-era"" London into a stylised and colourful mele,  bringing out the humour and joyfulness of the screenplay, and Cecil  Beaton's extravagant and yet, somehow, chic costumes and sets form a  perfect setting for the actors - and the actors themselves are superb. Rex  Harrison is totally believable as Henry Higgins, mixing crustiness with a  very dry humour, whereas Audrey Hepburn looks just right as Eliza  Doolittle. One is forced to ponder what Julie Andrews would have done in  the role, following her playing the part on stage, but I just can't see  Eliza played by anyone other than Audrey Hepburn, who is, quite simply,  delicious. From the mawkish, ramshackle flower-girl, to the rebellious  pupil, to the cool and composed ""lady"" of the title, she is  perfectly credible, whether throwing a Cockney temperament, or floating  through the conservatory, calmly sending Professor Higgins about his  business. I am told her Cockney accent is awful, but being deaf, I cannot  comment; no more than I can comment upon the fact that apparently her  recording of ""Oh Wouldn't It Be Luverly"" has been reinstated upon  the soundtrack. The appeal for this film lies in its spectacle - I saw it  at the cinema once, in an arthouse revival, and it was utterly amazing -  and in the speech therapy storyline, which has a lot of relevance to me.  ""My Fair Lady"" is simply... a cinematic glory of a particular  type that would be impossible to duplicate ever again.

Overall, this is a  timeless masterpiece, and I cannot imagine ANYONE not liking it...... My  favourite songs are 'I Could Have Danced All Night' and 'Without You'. I  also love 'The Rain in Spain.' Overall, this musical movie deserves more  than TEN stars!",945648000,2,905,4.973333333333334
809696,2,630417893X,"This DVD is a poor substitute for the magnificent Laser or even VHS restored versions. The DVD is NOT THX and it SHOWS. The carefully restored opening titles are fuzzy with Frequent color correction going on during the  floral sequence. The Sound is even Worse, with people muffled and tinny.  Keep your laser. Don't do what I did!- Assume the DVD would be an  improvement! Warner's never returned my call!",945475200,7,406,4.771428571428571
809697,5,630417893X,the refurbishing job was superb but i believe it would have been SO MUCH better had they incorporated the audrey sung versions of 'wouldn't it be lovely' and 'show me'. This is indeed a true classic. the music of Fred.  Lowe is fantastic with the recurring themes & counterpnt. string  lines. Don't make em like that anymore.,944870400,,325,4.684210526315789
809698,5,630417893X,"This is an incredible film. One of the best screenplays every written, this is a true classic. Everyone involved with it's production does a superb job, and the movie is a joy to watch again and again. (In fact I  bought the DVD version because my VHS tape was starting to wear-out.)
To  make things even better the DVD version is superbly done. Colors are  vibrant, and the sound is terrific. WB finally did a DVD translation right  with this disc and it shows. It's presented in full ""letterbox""  widescreen which captures all the elements missing from the VHS  tape.
Best of all the disc is packed with extra features! You can watch  and hear Audrey Hepburn do her own singing in two of the movies songs  (Wouldn't It Be Loverly? and Show Me) and she does supprisingly well for  someone who's not a singer. Running commentary is included, as well as the  theatrical trailers. Amazon's price for this disc is a steal, so don't  hesitate!",942192000,8,939,4.596385542168675
809699,5,630417893X,"Although Julie Andrews was a better singer, Audrey Hepburn was a far much better actress with a wide range of acting abilities.  Mrs. Hepburn was very funny as well as dramatic.  Nobody could have portrayed the feelings  and expressions of Eliza Doolitle with such a heart-felt emotion and  honesty from beggining to end.  Only a flower girl as portrayed by Mrs.  Hepburn could have been the cause for Professor Higgins, a recalcitrant  bachelor, to say ""...I have grown accustomed to her..."" at the  possibility of a life without her.
My Fair Lady is one of the best  movies ever made. It is better than West Side Story, and Sound of Music  because of its extraordinary and unique storyline.  It is a superb movie  that happens to be a musical.  Besides its beautiful music, lyrics, actors,  costumes, period sets, and any other categories of production, the viewer  is captivated because of the most exquisite romantic comedy story ever  written, with its intricate and witty dialogue.  Only after several viewing  one may capture the delicacies and nuances of the story and its characters.  Every single line is as valuable as any other, and it has a meaning as  profound as any other, and they are so engaging that once the movie is over  one would not believe that 3 hours has elapsed.  Stage musicals brought  into the silver screen should not be judged with an emphasis on their music  and vocal abilities, but rather on their storylines, and the messages thus  portayed.
I definitely recommend the reading of both reviews by James  Berardinelli and Roger Ebert from the movie database here at amazon.  They  have it right on the money and so well written.
Here is a quote from  James Berardinelli:  ""Consider this possibility: a romantic comedy  with no nudity, no sex, and no kissing.  In fact, there aren't even any  declarations of love.  The closest the female character comes to admitting  her feelings is saying that she could have danced all night with the man;  the closest he gets is remarking that he is grown accustomed to her face.  Could such a project lift off the pad in today's cliamte?
One would be  very cynical if he or she has not seen the movie before, as it happened to  me until I saw it in this restored DVD.",935625600,4,2240,4.689922480620155
