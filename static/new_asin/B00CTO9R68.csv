I contacted Karen Hood concerning these videos to ensure they were legit and Artisan Ideas is an authorized seller of the Hood's movies!!!!
Buy with confidence and knowledge that you're carrying on the Hood's legacy and not supporting some rip-off artist. These are the real deal!!!

****END OF UPDATE***

I'm lucky enough to have know Ron Hood via his old EZBoards forum. The man was a legend in my eyes for many reasons. Articulate, knowledgeable, wise, and above all else patient and kind. He had a unique way of actually coming thru and delivering the knowledge thru his movies. Something most others fail at.

Production quality of his videos was pretty good considering his wife Karen and him were independently producing their video series. All these years later I'm using Ron and Karen's videos to teach my own kids before taking them to the woods to practice their skills beyond the backyard. (I've recommended Hood's Wood's to many people over the years and have used the Hood's videos to help get people started from friends to family members)

I purchased my videos directly from the Hood's and own both the VHS and DVD formats. I think highly enough of their videos that I bought them all as well as their magazine. I'm not a fan boy or koolaide drinker having seen many videos from many sources as well as read everything I could get my hands on at one time before I tired of new authors regurgitating what their forefathers (men and women like Ron and Karen) put forth so many years before.

Simply put in my opinion the Hood's videos set the bar and are the standard to which everyone else strives to dethrone in today's world!!!

Should you purchase the Hood's videos I would beseech you too research and make sure you're buying directly from Karen Hood. I hope Ron's legacy and teaching continues to influence minds both young and old for decades to come!!

If you're new to wilderness survival the Hood's videos are the best place to start. This is my opinion however if you saw my library I think you'd agree that I might have seen enough to form a valid belief and opinion.

I hope this review helps someone out and that after they learn enough to have an idea how much we all don't know yet the Masters like Ron tried to teach us in their short time on this Earth just how much they still teach us today and the value of their education.... Even thru DVD media.

I've purchased my own videos with my own money, paid full price, received to discounts other than possibly whatever specials were ran all those years ago, so my review is honest and uncolored.

God bless you all and may you all learn to survive!!!

8586133,5,B00CTO9R68,All the HoodsWoods videos by Ron and Karen Hood are great. If you learn what they are teaching you will be able to survive in an emergency. Ron is very funny and he holds your attention and really knows his stuff. Had the pleasure to meet him and he was as nice in person as he seems on the videos. We purchased a set for all for of our children and they are teaching their children these timeless skills.,1375401600,,405,4.139240506329114
