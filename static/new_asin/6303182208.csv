7840457,5,6303182208,"I absolutely love this video!! My only wish is that it was a longer workout. I love the workout so much I don't mind doing it 2x to feel fulfilled.  I have an old VHS tape with Victoria's workouts taped from Sports channel from back in the 90s.  My biggest fear is that the tape is going to disintegrate soon.  I've tried to get it copied to DVD but the tape is so old the quality is poor.  This video reminds me of some of those old workouts, which really make you sweat and are easy to follow. This is by far my favorite of hers!!",1433635200,,532,3.990566037735849
7840458,5,6303182208,This was one of my 1st work out videos. 100% results. I worked out three times a week for 30 minutes with great results. I wish this could be put on DVD. I would buy it in a second.,1390176000,,181,3.6666666666666665

It has been nearly 20 years since I used this video, by working out with her after the kids were at school and the baby was down for her nap. That baby is now at University and the two others are making their way in the world--Navy and just getting on.

I had a bad copy from my sister who's since lost her tape. I've been in the market for this video for years with no luck.

My best weight lost result was when I was on Weight Watchers and worked out 3 times a week with Ms. Johnson's H.A.B.I.T program.  I achieved my high school weight of 136 lbs. in just 6 months. Starting weight was 171 lbs.

Her sassy fun and funky approach makes the most challenging segments exciting! I don't know what's become of Victoria since the 90's, I hope she's well and wish she was on the fitness channel.",1310860800,,830,4.1625
7840460,5,6303182208,"ALTHOUGH THIS ONE SEEMS A LITTLE TOO EASY, PROBABLY BECAUSE I ONLY USED 3-LB WEIGHTS.  I GAVE THIS ONE A BETTER RATING THAN THE TECHNOFUNK SINCE THIS ONE IS NOT DANCING.",1306540800,,169,4.451612903225806
7840461,5,6303182208,In just one workout I felt my muscles for the first time in years.  I knew I was really working out.  Just try it.  You'll feel the burn and get on your way to success.,1048032000,3,168,3.742857142857143
