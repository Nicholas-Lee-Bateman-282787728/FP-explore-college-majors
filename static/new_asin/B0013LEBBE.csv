3116064,5,B0013LEBBE,"Like many others, I have bought and collected many roller coaster videos over the years. Most, have been filmed, and edited by people like The Discovery Channel, etc... Most are boring, choppy editing, and have nauseating and/or unnecessary commentary.  Now, along comes a real enthusiast from the roller coaster community... and WOW! Mr Alvey has taken the coaster video world to a place where it should have been all along. Real  point-of-view (POV) footage, showing a COMPLETE ride! No annoying fillers or unnecessary talking. NO educational material. Just the rides, and pure fun! Awesome stuff! Stap yourself in and enjoy the ride (and the DVD)!!",1202342400,,651,5.190476190476191
3116065,5,B0013LEBBE,"Easily the best coaster footage DVD out there. Unlike some DVDs that claim to have true coaster footage, this one really does. It is the closest POV I have seen besides actually riding it. It will make you feel as if you are there with a mounted camera used (very steady) and the coaster noises. No music is in the background, no commentary, and the POV is straight footage. It is not interrupted by offride shots or reverse POVs like some other DVDs out there. Also, there is more than just the Coaster POV. Each segment presents facts about the coaster and plenty of offride footage. It is a great DVD for coaster footage and if you are a true coaster enthusiast, you should buy it. I know I am looking forward to Volume 2!",1202342400,4,725,4.377777777777778
3116066,5,B0013LEBBE,"I have many VHS and DVD's about amusement parks and rollercoasters and I enjoy them all.  However, my favorite kind of footage is with little music or no music.  I enjoy the natural sounds of people ejoying the rides and the noise of the roller coasters.  The quality of roller coaster in the raw is highly rated.  If you love coasters, you must invest in this DVD.  I look forward to more volumes of in the raw.",1202342400,,412,4.298701298701299
3116067,5,B0013LEBBE,"As someone who has ridden over 200 of the world's top ranked coasters and owner of just about every VHS and DVD recording of front seat coaster footage ever made, I can honestly state that this is the best footage ever done. Very smooth filming (no typical rattling and shaking). ALL of the world's top ranked ""woodies"" are included here with special attention given to The Voyage, winner of the prestious Golden Ticket award given annually to the top vote getter amongst experienced coaster enthusiasts. Great footage of the world's tallest AND fastest steel coaster, Kingda Ka, and many other sensational steel thrillers. Mr. Alvey is easily producing the best roller coaster footage year after year. Check out his website Theme Park Review after you are ecstatic with this purchase. Enjoy it...over and over. Then go ride 'em! It's all good.",1202342400,,844,4.99290780141844

They travel the world to ride the best and even some that are outside the 'norm' which can be quite entertaining! Robb Alvey always does a really great job on the recordings. The quality is always outstanding. This series shows the footage as it happened I think so it has a different type of editing or 'in the raw'. Really great videos. There are several in this series so collect them all! If you love coasters, you will not be disappointed.",1409788800,,560,4.905263157894737

Being new to this kind of Blu-Ray I wanted to give my God-Children a thrill when they come to stay later on in the 'summer', particularly if the weather isn't going to be up to visiting theme parks in person.  There is no doubt that this disc provides plenty of thrills!!  I've tried it in 3D on the 2D-3D tv, it's not always fantastic but occasionally adds even more to the experience!

3116075,5,B0013LEBBE,"At this writing, Roller Coasters in the Raw HD Volume 1 Blu-Ray, has 4.5 stars. And it should. All the great things others have mentioned is true indeed. So, no sense talking about how great something is when everybody else already has raved about it.

My review is for those with projectors who are considering this blu-ray.

In one word; AMAZING! But there's a little secret.

My screen is a professional 9' diagonal. My projector is no big deal, but it does have HD capabilities and Texas Instruments DLP. I'm using a Sony blu-ray (I hate Sony, but it's all Costco was carrying). The projector does not have HDMI. It has VGA. So my cable goes from VGA to the Sony Blu-Ray via component. Because of the VGA to component, I'm only capable of 720p.

Because of the previous reviews, we know the HD on this roller coaster Blu-Ray is very nice. One thing I wanted was to try and get more depth when watching the disc. And boy, did I find a way. It's called the ""Pulfrich Effect"" If you don't know what the Pulfrich Effect is, I suggest you Wikipedia it and read up. In short, it's a poor man's 3D, needs nothing special but a pair of glasses with one clear lens and one tinted (like a faint  sunglass) lens. And it looks very impressive on this disc. Is it as good as the big theaters blockbuster 3D movies? Well, no.....but it looks pretty dog gone cool, I'll tell ya that much.

I purchased a bunch of Pulfrich 3D glasses on-line for cheap. NOTE: NOT ANAGLYPH. Do not get the red/blue or cyan/magenta, etc. You need the Pulfrich Glasses. Just Google or eBay Pulfrich 3D glasses. Lots of places to get them. The trick to assure that all your guests actually experience the 3D effect using the Pulfrich glasses is that it's important to get the paper glasses because the tinted lens should cover the viewers dominant eye. While the glasses only come with a clear left lens and a tinted right lens, even if a guests dominant eye is the left eye, simply flip the paper glasses around and bend back temples at the hinge. Some guests would say they couldn't see the 3D effect. But once they flipped the glasses around....wah-lah!

Another thing I did was seat the guests very close to the screen. We're talking the first row of guests was about 8 feet from the screen, then the next row behind - butted right up against the front row. Basement room was pitch black, Bose system on 7, and just a few minutes into it I have guests actually getting queasy. It's a smash hit!

If you got a projector and thinking about getting this DVD, do it! And try the ""Pulfrich Effect 3D"".
I think you'll really like it. I know all my guests do.",1328227200,,2623,4.416149068322981
3116076,4,B0013LEBBE,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves the footage of the roller coasters, however, there is some mildly bad language, because they show real people riding the coasters and yelling obscenities along the way...something to aware of if you're buying for kids.",1325030400,7,265,5.045454545454546
3116077,3,B0013LEBBE,"This is my review of the individual ride POV's and the production as a whole.  The scores are based firstly on POV camera positioning, and secondly on the excitement of watching that particular POV.  Please note that these are not actual reviews of the rides themselves but the experience of watching it in POV.  Let me start by saying that the video quality in this production is suburb in every aspect.  The whole thing is shot in 1080 HD and it shows...

Intimidator 305:  10/10  Perfect

Rampage:  9/10  Excellent

Xcelerator:  8/10 Very Good

Balder:  7/10  Good (POV camera only about 2 ft above track, but still somewhat watchable)

Flight of the Phoenix:  8/10 Very Good

Manta:  10/10 Perfect  (the Manta wing gives a perfect sense of both speed and scope)

Vuoristorata:  5/10  Fair  (this POV is not exciting at all, the ride is just too old (1951) and slow at just 37mph)

Flight Deck:  6/10 Above Fair  (Inverted coasters don't make good POV's unless the camera is just right)

Insane:  6/10 Above Fair  (it's very hard to capture the essence of this kind of ride in POV form)

Prowler:  1/10 Atrocious (the POV camera is less than 4 inches above the track making it impossible to watch. This is a shame because this would have gotten an 8 or 9 if the POV camera was placed in a sensible position.  It seems as if they placed the camera in front of the coaster just inches above the track which will only serves to give you a seizure if you watch it)

Dive Coaster:  3/10  Very Poor  (once again the POV camera is just inches from the track, infact I think in this case they attached the camera beneath the coaster.  It still views better than Prowler though because the track is wider and gets a little deeper in the middle which doesn't block the view as badly.  Once again this is a shame because this would have gotten a 10 if the POV camera was in a sensible position.  On a personal note, I rode the US version of this ride and it's the best, just a shame that they placed the POV camera so close that you only see track.  This camera is so low that the track brakes are parallel to it).

Loop the Loop 7/10  Good (not the most exciting coaster in the world, but it is watchable)

Giant Dipper 7/10 Good (again, not too terribly exciting but still not too bad for a 1925 coaster)

Afterburn  7/10 Good (another invert, but the camera positioning is better than Flight Deck)

Revenge of the Mummy 6/10  Above Fair (The darkness of this indoor ride makes it impossible to truly capture it on POV)

Wooden Coaster Fireball:  8/10  Very Good

Georgia Scorcher:  7/10  Good  (seems very slow for a Steelie, at least from the POV perspective)

Jetline:  7/10  Good

Rutschebanen:  7/10  Good  (Old and slow but still watchable. Made in 1932)

Piraten:  8/10 Very Good (great ride, if POV camera was slightly higher would have gotten a 9)

D Coaster  7/10

Thunder Coaster:  6/10  Above Fair (the POV camera is about 2 ft above the track, so its somewhat watchable but not entirely enjoyable).

Vortex:  8/10  Very Good

Cannonball:  9/10  Excellent

Nessie:  9/10  Excellent

Tornado:  8/10  Very Good  (another invert, but captured well)

Tranan:  5/10  Fair  (this looks like a great ride, but it doesn't work so well in POV)

Silver Bullet:  8/10  Very Good (another invert, but allot of fun to watch)

Ultra Twister:  6/10  Above Fair  (the ride is too bouncy and twisty to get a good POV experience)

Thunderbird:  1/10  Atrocious  (again the POV camera is just inches from the track making it unwatchable.  Sadly, once again if the POV camera was placed a meter higher this would have scored probably a 9)

Bonus  7/10  Good  (the nature of this ride does not lend itself to POV viewing very well, but I can see it's a great ride)

All in all this is a very good buy, its only plagued by certain POV camera angles that are just way too close to the track which seriously hampered the enjoyment of those segments.  I can only assume that in those instances there was no other way to place the camera higher.  But I would still hope that before they release volume 2 that they would cut out any shots that have that same problem (its better not to see a particular coaster at all than to see it and be unable to enjoy it because the POV camera is too close to the track)...

I also felt as though they could have put a better selection together, but that's purely a matter of preference.  Of the 30 POV's 12 got scores of 8 or higher and its really only for those 12 that I would recommend this blu Ray.  If Volume 2 can have 20 or 30 POV's like the 12 really good ones in this production then that would truly be an amazing feat.  Also bear in mind that 5 of the POV's would have also scored higher than 8 if their POV cameras were placed in good positions as well, so hopefully if the producers are taking note, then volume 2 should really be nice.

Cheers...",1311465600,,4878,4.41316685584563
3116078,5,B0013LEBBE,"This HD video is everything I hoped it would be, and far more. Obviously, an enormous amount of labor and expense went into the production, which was filmed all over the world. You'll take each ride, from end to end, in the front seat. Additionally, you'll see the cars whiz by from various vantage points on the ground or from elevation. The production values are of a very high order: great sharpness of detail, perfect lighting conditions, minimal camera vibrations, and excellent sound recording, not only of the screamers but of the machine noise. And there are so many rides to take! It just goes on and on and on. If you have any doubts about getting your money's worth, dismiss them. The producers of the video did everything right. When they repeat the adventure in Imax, I'll buy it too.

This video required the enthusiastic cooperation of many amusement park managers, which obviously was obtained. If you'd like a realistic preview of any ride you've not yet experienced in the flesh, you'll find it here. This video would make a great gift for anyone who loves to ride roller coasters.",1302998400,,1099,4.7539267015706805
3116079,3,B0013LEBBE,"I bought the Non-Bluray version of this video BEFORE the HD version came out. It was OK, kinda blurry at times, and the constant commentary by the riders within microphone range were sometimes annoying. But at least, you got a somewhat ""Front Seat"" experience of the rides. So, I went ahead and ordered the Bluray HD version of Vol 1. The video quality was better, for most of the episodes, but there were a couple that would not qualify for Bluray quality, OR even Standard Video quality, and these should have been edited out. I saw the words ""Stunning"" used by other reviewers. Those must have been In-house reviews, because when one buys Bluray 1080p DVD's, you DO expect Stunning, Thrilling and Awesome, but this video seems to be only slightly upscaled from the non-Bluray version. This is the best that is out, so far in DVD, but, the rave reviews  are overstepping a bit. There is also the annoying repeatedly girl-screaming, (sometimes, girl-screaming by guys) that seems like a specially enhanced performance for the type of rides they are on.  This video could have, and should have been much better for the Bluray endorsement. If you are into Rollercoasters, and want to experience the effect from your living room, buy it.  But if you expect the clarity of a Theme Park ride, it's not THAT good.",1290556800,,1308,4.753303964757709
3116080,5,B0013LEBBE,"This dvd is exactly as advertised-- nothing but AWESOME first-person footage taken from the front seat of some of the best coasters in the world!  The footage is in crystal-clear HD and is not the least bit shaky, even on the rough wooden coasters.  You literally feel like you're on the ride.  Specs are also given for each coaster, as well as several minutes of off-ride footage, making this the next best thing to actually being in the park and riding them in person.  Disc is a burned copy (produced entirely by Theme Park Review) but works perfectly and is guaranteed by the sellers.  A+++ product!  Can't wait for future volumes!!!",1278720000,,637,4.693693693693693

3116082,5,B0013LEBBE,I Just recieved my bluray of Roller Coasters in the raw HD Volume 1. Let me start by saying that I have bought all of the Coaster Expedition DVD's in the past from the folks at theme park review and have always been impressed at how professional the films were edited with a wide variety of Coasters from all over the world set to music as well as natural sounds along with some crazy antics then later on the Coasters in the Raw series were released and they were just totally raw footage no cheesy music just pure coaster footage and sound and I once remember thinking there is no way they can top those releases and that is until now with the release of Coasters in the raw HD volume 1 not only is the film shot in HD but the disc also runs for about 2 hours and has a lot of totally new footage including POV's so realistic make you feel like you are on the ride and my favourite coaster in the film would have to be a coaster called Ultra Twisters as I have never had the privellage to ride this sort of coaster before myself it gave me a real perspective of the feeling for the ride and for those of you that either own a pair of pulfrich 3D glasses or have a 3D TV that utilizes the 2D to 3D option making the film a whole new experience for me and making it my new favourite theme park review release. So in my final thoughts I would give this amazing Bluray a 5 star rating and look forward to future releases.,1275955200,,1419,4.089605734767025

The answer? so you can see mor than just the coaster rides, learn about the parks and see what it is to experience them. Well this DVD does none of that! Not very educational of the parks and even the rides shown. Just plain pov shots that are available anywhere on the web. I wonder if they just downloaded the coaster videos from the internet and then made the dvd. It seems like it because it has no original content! Not even sure if they really shot it themselves. I want documentry style roller coaster and theme park vids, TPR usually doesn not do any documentary stuff about the rides so their dvds (At least the 3 I have) are nothing but a bunch of self obbsessed enthusists that create nothing of content! They should go to film school and then make a real video! I am an award winning filmmaker and I would NEVER put somthing like this on the market in fright that my name would be ruined!

3116094,5,B0013LEBBE,"""Coasters In The Raw!"" Vol. 1 & 2 are a highly recommended set of DVD-Rs from ThemeParkReview.com.  If you are going to buy them, do so from their website for $10 a piece.  They also have a fantastic 12 volume ""Coaster Expedition"" series showcasing all of the parks around the world that the C.E. groups have visited over the years.  Concerning the ""Raw"" series, which now has a 3rd set available covering ""roller coasters that have been closed, demolished or re-located"".  As with the first two sets, the third is also separated into ""woodies"" and ""steelies"", with 25 POVs for the first and 31 for steelies.  This is way more than on the initials sets of the series, which only have 15 rides per type on disc, plus a bonus.  In each series, a ride starts with data about it, then multiple views of the coaster in action from around or above it.  Then you ride it from beginning to end seated in the front car.  After that, you are treated to more multiple angles of the ride in action, sometimes from the rear car looking backwards or up the side.  Rob Alvey and his crew always do a spectacular job on their footage, so you will not be disappointed.  No other series of DVDs covers them as perfectly as ""Coasters In The Raw!"", as well as the ""Coaster Expedition"" series.  But, as mentioned, get them from ThemParkReview.com.  The purchase goes toward more C.E. trips and future DVDs, especially more ""Raw!"" discs.",1241913600,,1415,4.571428571428571

There is footage of the coasters from outside the cars and then a full ride inside the cars...usually from the front row. I love the footage.

3116101,5,B0013LEBBE,"Well, this is by far the best coaster DVD I've watched. POVs are fine but again, there are a lot of POVs around the internet already. What mostly impresses me in that DVD, are the offride shoots and that's what I love most on a coaster video. While a POV shoot is necessary for one to understand the coaster's layout, offride shoots is what puts the coaster on a real scale perspective. Also, the fact that there is no music at all apart from people's screaming and the coasters' original sound makes you feel like you're actually at the park! Such a great feeling...

I've already ordered the volume 2 and I can't wait for it to come!

These DVDs gives you that up close and on the ride feeling with out the high jinks and sometimes distracting background music that you get with other roller coaster movies. I'm not saying that the other Theme Park Review dvds are not good, they are excellent and worth buying, but Raw 1 is the best.  We are so excited about Raw 2 coming out, It's the #1 gift on my sons Christmas list this year.  Robb and the others at Theme Park Review are super nice and answer email fast and in person. You won't be disappointed with the DVDs in Roller Coaster in the RAW 1. Check out their web page too for great Roller Coaster action and information. TPR you rock!",1228003200,,747,4.290780141843972
3116103,5,B0013LEBBE,"I am so impressed with these DVDs.  I've always enjoyed watching footage of coasters (next best thing to riding them), but most coaster videos are really disappointing-- the view goes from ""about to go down the big hill"" to shots of the screaming riders.  I don't want to watch the riders, I want to watch the RIDE!  I love how when Mr. Alvey starts the POV (point of view) shots, he doesn't cut away until the ride is done.  He does show footage of the ride in motion (under the parking lot, under the parking lot...) and the riders, but doesn't cut away from the POV once it starts.

This is a well-made program; you can almost feel the airtime as you fly over the hills.  I got goosebumps a few times!  I hope that there are many, many sequels to this DVD to come.  I'd particularly like to see some of the coasters at Kennywood featured.  Overall, I'm very impressed and happy with this DVD.  One minor word of warning-- if you don't want your kids to hear a few swear words, you might want to turn the sound off during Eejanaika (I think that's the one).  I definitely can't blame the riders, though-- I'm sure I'd say a few choice words myself on that coaster, if I could even talk coherently!

I can't wait to let my mom watch these-- this is the only way she enjoys coasters, especially now that she's getting a lot of orthopedic problems.",1203811200,19,1347,4.344

This DVD edition -- Roller Coasters in the Raw: Volume 1 --is a perfect collection of rides from a few of their fairly recent adventures.

Don't be fooled by the name - the Rollercoaster's in this DVD are definitely ""raw"" in the sense that your viewing pleasure is not hindered by anything unnecessary.  At the same time if you worry that raw denotes something similar to lacking then fear not.  This video has everything necessary to take you on a ride that is the next best thing to being there.

There are 2 DVD's. One is dedicated to all steel coasters and the other is all wooden coasters. The coasters that are show are all recently opened rides. The Voyage, Hades, El Toro, Maverick, Tatsu to name but a few!

It is the closest POV I have seen besides actually riding it. It will make you feel as if you are there with a mounted camera used (very steady) and the coaster noises. No music is in the background, no commentary, and the POV is straight footage. It is not interrupted by offride shots or reverse POVs like some other DVDs out there. Also, there is more than just the Coaster POV. Each segment presents facts about the coaster and plenty of offride footage.

3350572,5,B0013LEBBE,"At this writing, Roller Coasters in the Raw HD Volume 1 Blu-Ray, has 4.5 stars. And it should. All the great things others have mentioned is true indeed. So, no sense talking about how great something is when everybody else already has raved about it.

My review is for those with projectors who are considering this blu-ray.

In one word; AMAZING! But there's a little secret.

My screen is a professional 9' diagonal. My projector is no big deal, but it does have HD capabilities and Texas Instruments DLP. I'm using a Sony blu-ray (I hate Sony, but it's all Costco was carrying). The projector does not have HDMI. It has VGA. So my cable goes from VGA to the Sony Blu-Ray via component. Because of the VGA to component, I'm only capable of 720p.

Because of the previous reviews, we know the HD on this roller coaster Blu-Ray is very nice. One thing I wanted was to try and get more depth when watching the disc. And boy, did I find a way. It's called the ""Pulfrich Effect"" If you don't know what the Pulfrich Effect is, I suggest you Wikipedia it and read up. In short, it's a poor man's 3D, needs nothing special but a pair of glasses with one clear lens and one tinted (like a faint  sunglass) lens. And it looks very impressive on this disc. Is it as good as the big theaters blockbuster 3D movies? Well, no.....but it looks pretty dog gone cool, I'll tell ya that much.

I purchased a bunch of Pulfrich 3D glasses on-line for cheap. NOTE: NOT ANAGLYPH. Do not get the red/blue or cyan/magenta, etc. You need the Pulfrich Glasses. Just Google or eBay Pulfrich 3D glasses. Lots of places to get them. The trick to assure that all your guests actually experience the 3D effect using the Pulfrich glasses is that it's important to get the paper glasses because the tinted lens should cover the viewers dominant eye. While the glasses only come with a clear left lens and a tinted right lens, even if a guests dominant eye is the left eye, simply flip the paper glasses around and bend back temples at the hinge. Some guests would say they couldn't see the 3D effect. But once they flipped the glasses around....wah-lah!

Another thing I did was seat the guests very close to the screen. We're talking the first row of guests was about 8 feet from the screen, then the next row behind - butted right up against the front row. Basement room was pitch black, Bose system on 7, and just a few minutes into it I have guests actually getting queasy. It's a smash hit!

If you got a projector and thinking about getting this DVD, do it! And try the ""Pulfrich Effect 3D"".
I think you'll really like it. I know all my guests do.",1328227200,,2623,4.416149068322981
3350573,4,B0013LEBBE,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves the footage of the roller coasters, however, there is some mildly bad language, because they show real people riding the coasters and yelling obscenities along the way...something to aware of if you're buying for kids.",1325030400,7,265,5.045454545454546
3350574,3,B0013LEBBE,"This is my review of the individual ride POV's and the production as a whole.  The scores are based firstly on POV camera positioning, and secondly on the excitement of watching that particular POV.  Please note that these are not actual reviews of the rides themselves but the experience of watching it in POV.  Let me start by saying that the video quality in this production is suburb in every aspect.  The whole thing is shot in 1080 HD and it shows...

Intimidator 305:  10/10  Perfect

Rampage:  9/10  Excellent

Xcelerator:  8/10 Very Good

Balder:  7/10  Good (POV camera only about 2 ft above track, but still somewhat watchable)

Flight of the Phoenix:  8/10 Very Good

Manta:  10/10 Perfect  (the Manta wing gives a perfect sense of both speed and scope)

Vuoristorata:  5/10  Fair  (this POV is not exciting at all, the ride is just too old (1951) and slow at just 37mph)

Flight Deck:  6/10 Above Fair  (Inverted coasters don't make good POV's unless the camera is just right)

Insane:  6/10 Above Fair  (it's very hard to capture the essence of this kind of ride in POV form)

Prowler:  1/10 Atrocious (the POV camera is less than 4 inches above the track making it impossible to watch. This is a shame because this would have gotten an 8 or 9 if the POV camera was placed in a sensible position.  It seems as if they placed the camera in front of the coaster just inches above the track which will only serves to give you a seizure if you watch it)

Dive Coaster:  3/10  Very Poor  (once again the POV camera is just inches from the track, infact I think in this case they attached the camera beneath the coaster.  It still views better than Prowler though because the track is wider and gets a little deeper in the middle which doesn't block the view as badly.  Once again this is a shame because this would have gotten a 10 if the POV camera was in a sensible position.  On a personal note, I rode the US version of this ride and it's the best, just a shame that they placed the POV camera so close that you only see track.  This camera is so low that the track brakes are parallel to it).

Loop the Loop 7/10  Good (not the most exciting coaster in the world, but it is watchable)

Giant Dipper 7/10 Good (again, not too terribly exciting but still not too bad for a 1925 coaster)

Afterburn  7/10 Good (another invert, but the camera positioning is better than Flight Deck)

Revenge of the Mummy 6/10  Above Fair (The darkness of this indoor ride makes it impossible to truly capture it on POV)

Wooden Coaster Fireball:  8/10  Very Good

Georgia Scorcher:  7/10  Good  (seems very slow for a Steelie, at least from the POV perspective)

Jetline:  7/10  Good

Rutschebanen:  7/10  Good  (Old and slow but still watchable. Made in 1932)

Piraten:  8/10 Very Good (great ride, if POV camera was slightly higher would have gotten a 9)

D Coaster  7/10

Thunder Coaster:  6/10  Above Fair (the POV camera is about 2 ft above the track, so its somewhat watchable but not entirely enjoyable).

Vortex:  8/10  Very Good

Cannonball:  9/10  Excellent

Nessie:  9/10  Excellent

Tornado:  8/10  Very Good  (another invert, but captured well)

Tranan:  5/10  Fair  (this looks like a great ride, but it doesn't work so well in POV)

Silver Bullet:  8/10  Very Good (another invert, but allot of fun to watch)

Ultra Twister:  6/10  Above Fair  (the ride is too bouncy and twisty to get a good POV experience)

Thunderbird:  1/10  Atrocious  (again the POV camera is just inches from the track making it unwatchable.  Sadly, once again if the POV camera was placed a meter higher this would have scored probably a 9)

Bonus  7/10  Good  (the nature of this ride does not lend itself to POV viewing very well, but I can see it's a great ride)

All in all this is a very good buy, its only plagued by certain POV camera angles that are just way too close to the track which seriously hampered the enjoyment of those segments.  I can only assume that in those instances there was no other way to place the camera higher.  But I would still hope that before they release volume 2 that they would cut out any shots that have that same problem (its better not to see a particular coaster at all than to see it and be unable to enjoy it because the POV camera is too close to the track)...

I also felt as though they could have put a better selection together, but that's purely a matter of preference.  Of the 30 POV's 12 got scores of 8 or higher and its really only for those 12 that I would recommend this blu Ray.  If Volume 2 can have 20 or 30 POV's like the 12 really good ones in this production then that would truly be an amazing feat.  Also bear in mind that 5 of the POV's would have also scored higher than 8 if their POV cameras were placed in good positions as well, so hopefully if the producers are taking note, then volume 2 should really be nice.

Cheers...",1311465600,,4878,4.41316685584563
3350575,5,B0013LEBBE,"This HD video is everything I hoped it would be, and far more. Obviously, an enormous amount of labor and expense went into the production, which was filmed all over the world. You'll take each ride, from end to end, in the front seat. Additionally, you'll see the cars whiz by from various vantage points on the ground or from elevation. The production values are of a very high order: great sharpness of detail, perfect lighting conditions, minimal camera vibrations, and excellent sound recording, not only of the screamers but of the machine noise. And there are so many rides to take! It just goes on and on and on. If you have any doubts about getting your money's worth, dismiss them. The producers of the video did everything right. When they repeat the adventure in Imax, I'll buy it too.

This video required the enthusiastic cooperation of many amusement park managers, which obviously was obtained. If you'd like a realistic preview of any ride you've not yet experienced in the flesh, you'll find it here. This video would make a great gift for anyone who loves to ride roller coasters.",1302998400,,1099,4.7539267015706805
3350576,3,B0013LEBBE,"I bought the Non-Bluray version of this video BEFORE the HD version came out. It was OK, kinda blurry at times, and the constant commentary by the riders within microphone range were sometimes annoying. But at least, you got a somewhat ""Front Seat"" experience of the rides. So, I went ahead and ordered the Bluray HD version of Vol 1. The video quality was better, for most of the episodes, but there were a couple that would not qualify for Bluray quality, OR even Standard Video quality, and these should have been edited out. I saw the words ""Stunning"" used by other reviewers. Those must have been In-house reviews, because when one buys Bluray 1080p DVD's, you DO expect Stunning, Thrilling and Awesome, but this video seems to be only slightly upscaled from the non-Bluray version. This is the best that is out, so far in DVD, but, the rave reviews  are overstepping a bit. There is also the annoying repeatedly girl-screaming, (sometimes, girl-screaming by guys) that seems like a specially enhanced performance for the type of rides they are on.  This video could have, and should have been much better for the Bluray endorsement. If you are into Rollercoasters, and want to experience the effect from your living room, buy it.  But if you expect the clarity of a Theme Park ride, it's not THAT good.",1290556800,,1308,4.753303964757709

Let me start by saying that I have bought all of the Coaster Expedition DVD's in the past from the folks at theme park review and have always been impressed at how professional the films were edited with a wide variety of Coasters from all over the world set to music as well as natural sounds along with some crazy antics then later on the Coasters in the Raw series were released and they were just totally raw footage no cheesy music just pure coaster footage and sound and I once remember thinking there is no way they can top those releases and that is until now with the release of Coasters in the raw HD volume 1 not only is the film shot in HD but the disc also runs for about 2 hours and has a lot of totally new footage including POV's so realistic make you feel like you are on the ride and my favourite coaster in the film would have to be a coaster called Ultra Twisters as I have never had the privellage to ride this sort of coaster before myself it gave me a real perspective of the feeling for the ride and for those of you that either own a pair of pulfrich 3D glasses or have a 3D TV that utilizes the 2D to 3D option making the film a whole new experience for me and making it my new favourite theme park review release.

Thanks!!!!",1275091200,,312,4.048387096774194
3350586,5,B0013LEBBE,"I was looking for something that would be a bit different than the usual DVD movie.. something the kids would be interested in that had no plot, and could run in the background... What I got, however was one heck of a DVD, packed with some of the best roller coaster rides in the world... No kidding!...The entire family paused as I previewed it (turning my preview into a full fledged screening), and grabbed seats to watch...This DVD was a great buy, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in virtual rides, and roller coasters.",1274227200,6,538,4.614583333333333
3350587,1,B0013LEBBE,"You can see povs of every coaster on this dvd on youtube so why spend the 12 bucks? The answer? so you can see mor than just the coaster rides, learn about the parks and see what it is to experience them. Well this DVD does none of that! Not very educational of the parks and even the rides shown. Just plain pov shots that are available anywhere on the web. I wonder if they just downloaded the coaster videos from the internet and then made the dvd. It seems like it because it has no original content! Not even sure if they really shot it themselves. I want documentry style roller coaster and theme park vids, TPR usually doesn not do any documentary stuff about the rides so their dvds (At least the 3 I have) are nothing but a bunch of self obbsessed enthusists that create nothing of content! They should go to film school and then make a real video! I am an award winning filmmaker and I would NEVER put somthing like this on the market in fright that my name would be ruined! THey have promise but they are too chaotic for their own good! MAKE A REAL VIDEO GUYS!",1257811200,10,1071,4.229268292682927
3350588,5,B0013LEBBE,"Theme Park Review's ""Roller Coasters In The Raw"" series are essential for any roller coaster fan. They include extensive video footage without any distracting music or annoying hosts that other roller coaster DVDs have. There is coverage of more European coasters than ever before. The footage is shot exeptionally well. If you are an enthusiast or just someone who enjoys roller coasters, these DVDs surpass expectation and will bring you loads of entertainment.",1244764800,,463,5.3561643835616435
3350589,5,B0013LEBBE,"OMG!!!Loved this DVD set. I actually received it for my birthday, so it was a great gift.  I just ordered vol. 2 today( 5/31/09)!  I have to say that between the two types, woodies are my absolute favorite.  I loved Hades and the Voyage the most.  As for the steelies, The Maverick and Hollywood Dream were my favorites on this volume.  Can't wait for the next volumes!!!If you love coaster footage, you cannot go wrong with these DVDs.  I will always choose Theme Park Review products over other footage.  Get this DVD: you will love it.  Just make sure that you cover the ears of your kiddies, for there are swear words in some of the coverage.",1243728000,,646,4.461538461538462

There was no false advertising on the cover box. My favorites would have to be the footage of El Toro and The Voyage from the Woodies (Those rides look incredible). From the Steelies, Maverick (Only because its my favorite rollercoaster) and Tatsu (This ride is just cool to watch in general).",1242086400,,429,5.056338028169014
3350591,5,B0013LEBBE,"""Coasters In The Raw!"" Vol. 1 & 2 are a highly recommended set of DVD-Rs from ThemeParkReview.com.  If you are going to buy them, do so from their website for $10 a piece.  They also have a fantastic 12 volume ""Coaster Expedition"" series showcasing all of the parks around the world that the C.E. groups have visited over the years.  Concerning the ""Raw"" series, which now has a 3rd set available covering ""roller coasters that have been closed, demolished or re-located"".  As with the first two sets, the third is also separated into ""woodies"" and ""steelies"", with 25 POVs for the first and 31 for steelies.  This is way more than on the initials sets of the series, which only have 15 rides per type on disc, plus a bonus.  In each series, a ride starts with data about it, then multiple views of the coaster in action from around or above it.  Then you ride it from beginning to end seated in the front car.  After that, you are treated to more multiple angles of the ride in action, sometimes from the rear car looking backwards or up the side.  Rob Alvey and his crew always do a spectacular job on their footage, so you will not be disappointed.  No other series of DVDs covers them as perfectly as ""Coasters In The Raw!"", as well as the ""Coaster Expedition"" series.  But, as mentioned, get them from ThemParkReview.com.  The purchase goes toward more C.E. trips and future DVDs, especially more ""Raw!"" discs.",1241913600,,1415,4.571428571428571

3350594,5,B0013LEBBE,"Everything made by Theme Park Review is amazing! RAW Volume 1 is an amazing pair of DVDs(one of wooden coasters and one for steel). The POV shots give you that great feeling of sitting in the front of the coaster. The quality of the video is superb as well. After watching RAW 1 and 2, I can not wait for the spring when the parks open up. Until then, at least I have the DVDs to give me my thrill fix. I also recommend the Expedition videos that TPR sells.",1230854400,,457,4.088888888888889

You hear the clank of the lift chain, the roar of the wheels, the screams, the wind whistling past your head.  You begin to ""feel"" the rides.  As you watch, you find yourself leaning right,then left with every turn.  I have never experienced videos like ""Roller Coasters in the Raw"" except in expensive simulators.  Great quality without the annoying commentary found on many cable documentaries.  Just all the fun.  If you can't travel around the globe to enjoy these mechanical wonders, BUY THESE VIDEOS!  If you've ridden these coasters and want to remember the fun and excitement, BUY THESE VIDEOS!  The best bang for the buck on the net.",1230508800,,764,4.770992366412214

There is footage of the coasters from outside the cars and then a full ride inside the cars...usually from the front row. I love the footage. For the coasters I've ridden, it brought back lots of great memories and for the ones I haven't ridden, the footage makes me want to plan a trip to ride them.

No talking or scanning of the park, just the best part, the coasters!",1228089600,,371,4.333333333333333
3350598,5,B0013LEBBE,"Well, this is by far the best coaster DVD I've watched. POVs are fine but again, there are a lot of POVs around the internet already. What mostly impresses me in that DVD, are the offride shoots and that's what I love most on a coaster video. While a POV shoot is necessary for one to understand the coaster's layout, offride shoots is what puts the coaster on a real scale perspective. Also, the fact that there is no music at all apart from people's screaming and the coasters' original sound makes you feel like you're actually at the park! Such a great feeling...

I've already ordered the volume 2 and I can't wait for it to come!

Rob and Elissa, thanks for the good work",1228089600,,677,4.365079365079365
3350599,5,B0013LEBBE,"I purchased Roller Coasters in the Raw 1 last spring for my son who is crazy about coasters. These DVDs gives you that up close and on the ride feeling with out the high jinks and sometimes distracting background music that you get with other roller coaster movies. I'm not saying that the other Theme Park Review dvds are not good, they are excellent and worth buying, but Raw 1 is the best.  We are so excited about Raw 2 coming out, It's the #1 gift on my sons Christmas list this year.  Robb and the others at Theme Park Review are super nice and answer email fast and in person. You won't be disappointed with the DVDs in Roller Coaster in the RAW 1. Check out their web page too for great Roller Coaster action and information. TPR you rock!",1228003200,,747,4.290780141843972
3350600,5,B0013LEBBE,"I am so impressed with these DVDs.  I've always enjoyed watching footage of coasters (next best thing to riding them), but most coaster videos are really disappointing-- the view goes from ""about to go down the big hill"" to shots of the screaming riders.  I don't want to watch the riders, I want to watch the RIDE!  I love how when Mr. Alvey starts the POV (point of view) shots, he doesn't cut away until the ride is done.  He does show footage of the ride in motion (under the parking lot, under the parking lot...) and the riders, but doesn't cut away from the POV once it starts.

This is a well-made program; you can almost feel the airtime as you fly over the hills.  I got goosebumps a few times!  I hope that there are many, many sequels to this DVD to come.  I'd particularly like to see some of the coasters at Kennywood featured.  Overall, I'm very impressed and happy with this DVD.  One minor word of warning-- if you don't want your kids to hear a few swear words, you might want to turn the sound off during Eejanaika (I think that's the one).  I definitely can't blame the riders, though-- I'm sure I'd say a few choice words myself on that coaster, if I could even talk coherently!

I can't wait to let my mom watch these-- this is the only way she enjoys coasters, especially now that she's getting a lot of orthopedic problems.",1203811200,19,1347,4.344

Mr. Alvey does a great job capturing the excitement of each coaster without distractions.

Makes you want to just go out there and ride.

I hope another Volume is available by next Christmas.",1202428800,,416,4.493333333333333

Robb and Elissa travel the world riding some of the world's best coasters.  This DVD edition -- Roller Coasters in the Raw: Volume 1 --is a perfect collection of rides from a few of their fairly recent adventures.

Don't be fooled by the name - the Rollercoaster's in this DVD are definitely ""raw"" in the sense that your viewing pleasure is not hindered by anything unnecessary.  At the same time if you worry that raw denotes something similar to lacking then fear not.  This video has everything necessary to take you on a ride that is the next best thing to being there.

There is none of the ""show the same drop over and over"" type of thing. You get to see the ride from the beginning to end. There is also exterior video & facts for all the rides as well.

There are 2 DVD's. One is dedicated to all steel coasters and the other is all wooden coasters. The coasters that are show are all recently opened rides. The Voyage, Hades, El Toro, Maverick, Tatsu to name but a few!

Robb & Elissa (Theme Park Review) have alot of experience doing this type of thing and it shows!

It is best to watch the DVD on the big screen and sit close the screen and raise your hands up like you're actually on the roller coasters.  It's an amazing experiences watching like you're actually on the craziest roller coasters in the world.  YES, on both wooden and steel coasters!  I have been on a few of the roller coasters shown on DVD and it is like going down in the memory of the great experience of riding it.  If you miss this out, then you're missing the fun out of it.

I can overlook some words but when they are being yelled over and over in a matter of a few minutes it is hard to ignore. Plus there is one video in which the roller coaster is compared to a specific woman part. Again over and over.

Don't get me wrong, the rides on this DVD are really fun to get on but the down side is that most of the coasters are gone/torn down but to be fair, they do give you the information on the coaster's lifespan/history before they show the footage.
