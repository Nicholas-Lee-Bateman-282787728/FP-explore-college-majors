He loves seeing all they ""guys"" he has in the action figure line on TV and all the episodes teach a lesson.  I would rather him watch these DVDs than some of the shows on TV.  After watching he then acts out the missions with his toys.  It really helps with the imagination. Every Rescue Hero fan should get the DVDs!",1130371200,7,455,4.011111111111111

8067303,4,B0009VA2MG,"This collection only contains 7 episodes: ""Storm of the Century 1 & 2"" (episodes 13 & 14); ""When It Rains, It Pours"" (episode 9); ""Four-Alarm Fire & Brimstone"" (episode 10); ""Twister"" (episode 5); ""El Nino"" (I'm guessing is ""Wrath of El Nino"" - see wikipedia for list of Rescue Heroes episodes) (episode 3) and ""Arctic Spill"" (episode 8).  There are 40 episodes total, so I'm guessing they are not all included even when you buy all four collections.  I'm the kind of person who wants the entire collection.  Bummer!  So I'll go watch the others on youtube until Fisher Price deems it fit to include the entire collection some day.",1439251200,,631,4.709090909090909
8067304,5,B0009VA2MG,"Definitely 5 Stars ~ I appreciate Rescue Heroes because there is no violence from man to man. There are no bad guys. All episodes deal with dangerous situations caused by nature or industry. The only negative thing I would say is my wife and I do not care for the rock n roll theme (a bit to heavy for us). The Animation is the same as volume 1 & 3. We found Volume 4 they had improved the animation tremendously so if you are going to buy one start with volume 4. The prices are outrageous but we waited and were able to buy them below $10.00 Except for volume 3, you are going to pay a minimum of $15 or $20 for that (this review is July 2015). All that said this series is well worth the investment!",1437004800,,702,4.057553956834532

8067307,4,B0009VA2MG,"My original review stated the product didn't live up to how it was stated/sold on-line.  I'm not tremendously familiar with Amazon and didn't know I could return the product or contact the seller.  The seller saw my feedback and actually contacted me and refunded my money since the product didn't perform as stated on the website.  I'm stunned and very appreciative of the seller (ifrnager) contacting.me to make things right.

As far as the episodes on the DVD, my sons love them and they teach valuable outdoor and life skills in a simple way.  Rescue Heros is a quality program for kids.",1369180800,,591,4.754901960784314
8067308,5,B0009VA2MG,"My four year old son LOVES this show, so I had to get this for his birthday.  He travels in the car a lot, so this DVD is a superb distraction if your child like the show.",1368230400,,171,3.6216216216216215
8067309,5,B0009VA2MG,"I want my son to have toys and videos that are non-violent and teach that men and women can work together and be heroic together.  Rescue Heroes do that.  I wish they made cartoons like this today.  These were discontinued several years ago, and I am glad I can purchase them used on Amazon.com.  The DVD teach positive values such as teamwork, and also have safety lessons included in the exciting stories.  The Rescue Heroes DVDs show the same characters as the Rescue Heroes action figures.  The good Rescue Heroes action figures are available used on Amazon.com.  The newer version of the action figures are smaller, have no female figures, and are not as good as the older versions... But that's another story.  I highly recommend the Rescue Heroes Adventure Collection Volume Two DVD.",1319500800,,790,4.843283582089552
8067310,5,B0009VA2MG,"This is out of print and really hard to find now, and that is a shame as it was a great series for kids and worthy or re-release. There is a Rescue Heroes movie, but it is not nearly as good as the TV episodes were. It was a TV series for 3 seasons tied to a fun line of toys by the same name. Our copy came from the toy store, and was sold with the toys. This DVD was also sold by itself, released in 2001. There are 6 episodes on the disc and some great extras.
Extras include: Character Bios; Special Game for CD:ROM, where kids get to rescue animals and be the hero; Video clips/previews; Web links for CD:ROM
Episodes include: Storm of the Century part 1; and part 2; When it Rains, it Pours; Four-Alarm Fire and Brimstone; Twister; El Nino; Arctic Spill.
The Rescue Heroes series was made by the animation company ""Nelvana"" for Fisher price. Nelvana was turning out a lot of great programs during the late 90's including the Redwall series, Rupert, Tintin, Little Bear, Franklin, Babar and others.

The Rescue Heroes were a group of firefighters, police, rangers, and other public safety people that rescued other people in jeapordy. The Rescue Heroes show had fun scripts, great characters, good voice acting, and very polished animation. The best thing to say about the series, is that while much of the TV shows available for pre-schoolers are based on violence and fighting and good guys versus bad guys... In this show, natural disasters caused the need for human heroes to rescue people. Very positive messages about character and safety were included in each show. And it was entertaining enough for you to watch with your kid. I recommend this series to all.",1263772800,12,1672,4.591973244147157
