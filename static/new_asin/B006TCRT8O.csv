8503983,5,B006TCRT8O,"If you're expecting to see this documentary appear on the horizon of the History or National Geographic channels, then land lovers, you're in for a mighty long wait.

WHY THEY SANK TITANIC lays out in complete detail, through known historical fact,testimonials and re-enactments of what probably happened, that the real ship that sank on that historic night in 1912, was not the Titanic at all, but rather it's sister ship the Olympic. Without giving the rest of the story away, it was all a massive insurance scam by the White Star Line, to avoid financial ruin.  A scam that had JP Morgan's name all over it, along with the British establishment for political and economic reasons.

Yes... it's all been a big LIE! The legend, the myth of Titanic, has all been kept afloat for the simple reason, that if the truth was known, that over 1,500 lives were lost at sea because of a criminal conspiracy that didn't go according to plan. That the governments and official inquiries, the media, were all a part of the deception. Then if the public started to connect the dots with that,if the public started discovering the truth all these years later. Then maybe they might be wanting to see other major historical events, like the JFK assassination, 9-11, the London bombings, and so much more in a new light as well. What about all those HOLLYWOOD movies, all those books that have profited from this Titanic deception?

For many of us, we already know that so much of our history, so much of what we are taught to believe in, is one monumental lie after another. It's all about money and power, and the establishment hanging on to it. It's about protecting the guilty. However, this documentary gives you a chance to decide for yourself. It presents the evidence of conspiracy, just as if you were sitting on a jury. The fact that this DVD was hard to get hold of, and has only been seen by very few people, makes it even more credible.  Let's be honest, how many of us knew Titanic even had a sister ship, let alone one that was basically identical?

As they say ""most people can't handle the truth""... but I'm glad I took the plunge, not just for myself, but maybe for a sense of long overdue justice for all those that perished needlessly to keep the money men afloat!

Speaking of money... The three powerful bankers that were strongly opposed to the idea of a private Federal Reserve bank, John Jacob Astor, Benjamin Guggenheim and Isa Strauss, the three enemies of JP Morgan -they just happened to be among the dead.  And the Federal Reserve was launched the following year!",1353888000,3,2578,4.6381578947368425
8503984,5,B006TCRT8O,"I have this on order, but I viewed the segments on YouTube.  As a history buff and someone who has been fascinated by the story of the legendary vessel, I found that the theory presented in this film is not only plausible but actually explains a lot of the actions taken that night.

The theory is that the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic is not the vessel that began its life as Titanic, but rather her older sister ship, the Olympic sailing under Titanic's name.  To put it more bluntly, this film puts forth the theory (backed by credible evidence and inference) that White Star switched the names on the two ships when they were both at Harland & Wolff - Titanic was still being built and Olympic was in for repairs after her captain (E.J. Smith, who took out 'Titanic' for the fateful voyage) had twice damaged her when she collided with British naval vessel Hawk.

I am heartily sorry this was never released on the American side of ""the Pond"" (this DVD is in PAL format, by the way, and won't play on most players in the US)because it would certainly be well-received.  I'm surprised someone hasn't latched onto the theory and produced a movie based on it.

If you love Titanic lore, this is a must-see!",1334793600,3,1213,4.46606334841629
