In one hour we get to learn how to dye, cut, weave, and sew silk into new airy and ethereal wraps and woven article. Ms. Kralovic-Logan gives lots of useful information about weights and kinds of silk, and sources for all the materials she uses. She is clear on how the projects can be done at home and what is needed. This is a guided workshop, but Ms. Kralovic-Logan offers lots of options for further projects and variations. Her commentary is funny and helpful, with many tips, hints and explanations on the materials and projects. Watching this video makes me want to start on a project right away, with full confidence that I can make something wonderful!",1359158400,2,776,4.886363636363637
