6362553,4,B00JJRLG58,This movie showed how the Nazi processed the Jews coming into their Death Camps.  They got off the railroad car and were directed into a room and told to put luggage and other belongs in one area.  Then told to undress and put clothing on a special hook and to remember the number so that their shower they could find their clothing.  They were directed into this room for their showers and the door was slammed shut and locked.  Then the poisonous gas came out of shower heads and the people died from the fumes.  The selected Jewish men then moved the bodies on carts and down elevator to where the furnace was located and two men per body threw corpses into furnace and when full they shut the doors.  These selected Jewish men than went through the luggage and belongs looking for items that would make money for the Nazi.  Then ashes were gone through looking for gold teeth or any thing worth money for the Nazi.  These selected Jewish men were feed better and also has all the wine they could eat.  But these groups of men knew that they had a certain time to serve in this capacity and then they would be gassed and burned.  The women hid gun powder for the men to blow up the furnaces but the Nazi's found out and tortured the women to find out where the gun powder was hidden but they wouldn't tell them so they were tortured until they died.  The men in the one select group of Jewish men finally were able to blow up the furnaces and they escaped the death camp.  The was awful and showed just how inhumane the Nazi's were.
