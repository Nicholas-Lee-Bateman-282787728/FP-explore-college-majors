8364784,5,B002D3U4OO,"This DVD highlights the lives of Three individuals who decided to heal themselves through various  means despite their options with ""Traditional Medicine""-and for each person, the specific regimen they used-is listed.

This documentary is superb. It is simple, yet it highlights THE major problem with American Western medicine. (Allopathic medicine-Not Homeopathic..The difference is that ""Allopathic"" treats the ""symptom"" and ""Homeopathic"" treats the ""cause""
Here in the good-ole U.S. we want NOTHING to do with cure. It cuts into profits.

""What's Bad Is Good"",.. takes a look at Three brave people, diagnosed with life-ending illness, who decided that ""Traditional"" cures would lead to their premature demise- and treated themselves without any of the devastating side effects of those traditional medications(chemicals) they sought to avoid. Each person's ""interview"" ends with their respective ""healing regimen"" A great thing if you want some very good ideas about the DIRECT relationship between food & health.
 Clinicians  in this country are being trained to think that the ONLY tool in their arsenal is either the Scalpel or the array of ""Life Saving"" toxic, nasty and FDA approved therapies. All of which are saturated into our daily lives via the media. A point this story addresses as well.
 I highly recommend this to anyone to has ever seen a doctor.
Traditional medical-school education does not EVER include healing the Chronically ill, or the Cancer patient. There is no money in the cure-only the treatment.",1329955200,,1526,5.417721518987341
8364785,5,B002D3U4OO,"This is a remarkable, important film - a film that everyone should see because even if you don't ultimately agree with everything it covers (and, actually, it's hard not to) it will broaden your mind, it will make you think. And the central message here has to be that we should at the very least do that before we undertake conventional medical care for the worst kind of prognosises. The interviews with suffers of cancer, HIV, people who have been told that they are going to die and who have lived to tell the tale, are honest, articulate, perceptive and funny. And their message is unanimous - that doctors do not always help,and that pharmaceutical companies have more than our best interests at heart. When big business could be behind your personal welfare, you have to take a stand yourself. And this might just inspire you to do so. Fantastic. Loved it.",1249948800,6,863,4.684210526315789
