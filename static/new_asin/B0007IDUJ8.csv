2212120,3,B0007IDUJ8,"and I had to watch the whole dvd first to do it, and still, the steps are not easy to learn. I have to admit, I am bad at learning complicated choreographies, and I honestly don't really want to learn them in the first place (I want to work out without having to think about complicated step combos). So I am modifying the steps to keep up with them, and that works out just fine for me. It is a great cardio workout, once you get used to it.",1206921600,6,442,3.9775280898876404
2212121,3,B0007IDUJ8,"interesting workout with good choreography. Not boring like so many. I would prefer [as with all videos] that they leave the instructional portion in a seperate chapter on the disc and just get on with the workout. After you've done it 10 times it is very annoying to listen to the instructions evey time.  It is almost like the video is a lead up to the actual class, which is not on the DVD, but this is true of so many similar videos.",1158883200,3,437,4.265060240963855
2212122,2,B0007IDUJ8,"I have been working out for 20 years, doing cardio, weight lifting, stepping, kickboxing, pretty much everything. Although I really like Tracy and Michelle's other videos, the pace of this one is just too fast. They are doing so many different things on the stepper, and it's too hard to keep up. I felt I spent most of the time trying to figure out what the heck they were doing. I know sometimes it just takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but this one was ridiculous.

I liked the weight lifting part of it, at least I felt I got a workout from that. The movements on the stepper are just too complicated and there are too many of them incorporated into the workout. I was very disappointed.",1155513600,7,699,4.295454545454546
2212123,4,B0007IDUJ8,"I picked this video up in the bargain bin at Walmart and was shocked to find it one of the best out there. Blanacing weights and intense step in the same format as the newer Firm videos, this one will make you sweat for 45 minutes. At $5.98 it's a steal!",1151107200,,254,4.0

8047490,5,B0007IDUJ8,"I love this workout.  It just takes time to learn the steps, but once learned, it is so much fun and leaves me sweaty and feeling upbeat.",1484352000,,137,4.074074074074074
8047491,5,B0007IDUJ8,It gives me the workout I need.,1465516800,,31,3.5714285714285716
8047492,5,B0007IDUJ8,"I liked it.  It was not too complicated, but just fancy enough for me.  This was good for a light day of cardio, where you want to work up a sweat, but not work too hard.  I think Tracy and Michelle are great together.",1429833600,,218,3.909090909090909
8047493,4,B0007IDUJ8,"I would have enjoyed this work out better if more time was spent going over the steps.  Even as someone that danced, it took several times of doing the work out before I was able to do close to all of the steps.  It did give a great cardio work out, I haven't sweat that much in years.",1395360000,,285,3.896551724137931
8047494,4,B0007IDUJ8,"Excellent workout.  I think most folks could follow the routine.  Thankfully if you find the choreography complex in one section you're not on it long enough to fret over it due to the interval format of the workout.  The collaboration between Tracy and Michelle is always top notch.  For beginners, some of the step cardio combinations transition quickly but if you work with the video a few times you will get it, just be patient.  You can always clear your mind during the strength intervals:)",1389830400,2,496,4.788235294117647
8047495,2,B0007IDUJ8,"I purchased this workout dvd a while back and was really disappointed...I am an intermediate-level exerciser and this workout really didn't get my heart rate up as much as I'd have liked. Also, the choreography seemed awkward at times, at least to me. In addition, this was bad on my knees. Don't get me wrong, it's very low-impact, but there are a few twisting dance movements that caused some discomfort and just didn't feel ""right"". As for the pilates workout, it was pretty good...but not enough to warrant more than 2 stars, since the main workout was so awful.",1340928000,,566,4.7272727272727275
8047496,5,B0007IDUJ8,"After trying Tracy and Michelle's ""Step it Off"" video only twice, I loved it so much that I bought this one too.  This workout did not disappoint either.  You have to pay attention to the cueing, and it's not meant for beginners.  But I tackled this one without viewing it first, and I kept up with them.  I missed a few steps here or there, but that's to be expected for a first time. If you can follow Kari Anderson or Petra Kolbert, you can do this.  If I was new to stepping, this one probably would have made me cry, but I started stepping back in the days of Jane Fonda, so I know my way around a step bench. I got a great work-out.  My only complaints are 1.) the DVD doesn't tell you how long the warm-up, workout, and cool-down are on the jacket or on the DVD menu, and 2.) the stretches seemed rushed to me.  I usually end up stretching more on my own when the DVD is over.  Aside from that...I love this DVD.",1338422400,2,919,4.066666666666666
8047497,5,B0007IDUJ8,"This is a fast-paced cardio & weights workout, not at all for beginners. I really love the fact that the cardio portion is done using a step. Most interval/circuit style DVDs are hi/lo and toning. The step segments are advanced and you will need to pay attention to the cueing. Even though I have not always thought so; but these two instructors are professionals and know their stuff. Michelle specifically has come out with excellent DVDs more recently.
This workout is a ton of fun once you get it and challenging at the same time. Time just flies. The music is up-beat instrumental and some from recognizable songs which I find motivating. I actually use 3 risers (10"" step) and it kicks my butt. The pace for the weight segments slows down just enough where you can grab heavier dumbbells if you choose with enough reps where you feel your muscles worked (they might be holding 3 to 5 lbs, but I use 10 to 15 lbs). You get a good, sweatty interval workout in about an hour. I recommend this for the experienced stepper. Just love it!!",1289347200,2,1039,4.531914893617022
8047498,3,B0007IDUJ8,"Simple interval workout - not too hard, not too easy. Created with five routines consisting of 5 minutes cardio, 3 minutes strength. Cardio includes a 2 minute ""intense"" interval. My heart rate was around 60-70% of maximum, lower during strength. The strength did use upper/lower body at the same time to maintain heart rate. The atmosphere is a depressing studio, maybe it's supposed to look futuristic/modern? It's dark black/blue with minimal lighting. I like Michelle and have purchased her other videos. Tracy annoys me - I think she just wants to be noticed too much? She talks even when she's not leading just so she can be heard.",1236729600,,637,4.907407407407407
