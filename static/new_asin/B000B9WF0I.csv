2409462,1,B000B9WF0I,"Way too complicated even for an Intermediate stepper.  Too fast paced to  follow.  No real warm up, no real beat.  This DVD would be for the very fit and extremely advanced stepper.",1214784000,2,181,4.5625
2409463,5,B000B9WF0I,"Great Step DVD.  Great music, great combos, great cueing.  She is not distracting, just giving great cues.  Going to order more of her DVD's.",1204329600,4,141,4.791666666666667
2409464,1,B000B9WF0I,"This video was a big letdown! I'm a fairly advanced stepper and found this fast and confusing. Yes, there is an additional section of the DVD of step-by-step instruction but if I knew I had to waste time learning these complicated routines first, I wouldn't have bought it. I just want a dvd did I can pop in and a get a great, challenging workout and this is not it! I purchased her other one at the same time ""Totally cool step"" which is equally as disappointing.",1199059200,2,465,4.35632183908046
2409465,4,B000B9WF0I,"I have really enjoyed using this video for a change in my workouts.  With my other videos I didn't feel like I was working that hard.  Since I have started this video, I have lost 5 pounds in the last 4 weeks.  It makes me work harder and sweat a lot more.  I like the challenge she offers in the video instead of always doing the easy routine.  This video was worth my purchase.",1194048000,6,379,4.0675675675675675
2409466,1,B000B9WF0I,"This routine is too fast paced to enjoy or follow, there's not really any beat to follow and I could never get into the routine because she only does every step once before yelling out another instruction. She NEVER stops talking and I find it distracting! I'm an Intermediate to Advanced stepper and thought I'd be able to follow and appreciate the more complicated choreography, but I just can't get into it, it has no rhythm to speak of and I find myself RACING to keep up with her. I thoroughly hate this DVD.",1189641600,2,513,4.468085106382978
2409467,5,B000B9WF0I,"If you're new to Christi's workouts, the choreography will seem extremely difficult until you actually do it, partly because the pace is so much faster than most exercise videos. But she's such an outstanding instructor you'll be amazed at how quickly you catch on if you listen to her rather than just watching. This workout is SO much fun. The music she uses is also the best around, and I usually find myself singing along.",1188345600,4,426,4.693333333333333
2409468,5,B000B9WF0I,"I love the fact that most of the music is music that I recognize!  The choreography is complex, but she breaks it down for you in the ""Move Master"" section of the DVD.  She also has ""Combination Platters,"" where she will make different combinations of step segments and automatically pairs them with a warm up and a cool down-- you don't have to shuffle around the DVD to find your favorite parts of the workout.  A must buy for an aerobic DVD collection!",1169596800,6,455,4.457831325301205
2409469,4,B000B9WF0I,"This is the first workout I've tried by Christi Taylor. She has a reputation for fun, advanced, dancy step workouts and she did not disappoint me with ""Solid Gold Step"". The workout begins with four combos with the step in the standard lateral position. After an exertion check, she moves into four more combos with the step in the vertical position. Each combo is built up and then repeated numerous times. It is complex and a bit tricky, but Christi's cueing is so good you will get most of it OK on your first run-through if you are an experienced stepper. Throughout, the choreography is unique and fun. The music is recognizable, top 40 hits such as a remake of N'sync's ""Tearin' Up My Heart"".

One good thing about this workout is that there are ""Bonus Beauties"" by members of Christi's cast. There are individual segments on pilates, abs, squats, etc. that you can add on to your workout or do separately. The ""Choreography 101"" section of the DVD introduces basic step moves, but is really only useful for absolute beginners to step aerobics.

The only downside to this workout is the cool-down. It is made up of lame, pseudo-hip hop moves and is choreographed to a song by Christi's son. I won't be doing the cool-down in the future. I will, however, use this workout frequently. It is a lot of fun and it really gave me a good cardio workout.",1142553600,6,1352,4.582644628099174
8083959,5,B000B9WF0I,"Love this workout. Challenging, but doable if are an experienced stepper.",1516147200,,73,5.7272727272727275
8083960,5,B000B9WF0I,"One of my favorite Christi Taylor workouts, if you love to dance, this one's for you!
The first half is 26 minutes and includes four 64-beat steps, the second half is 21 minutes and includes another four 64-beat steps done with your step perpendicular to the TV.  The music will keep you moving and includes such selections as ""Boogie Wonderland"".  The steps can be intricate and are taught first for the beginner, then added to to make them more challenging.  Four exercisers in the back of the room show the beginner version, however I don't find it to be helpful as you can't really see what they're doing and she cues to the advanced steps.
The video does include her signature ""Move Master"" section, which breaks down each step and shows it in its beginner and advanced forms, helpful if you're just starting out.
The cool-down is awful!",1424649600,,842,4.675675675675675
8083961,4,B000B9WF0I,Fun workout.,1424563200,,12,5.5
8083962,1,B000B9WF0I,No verbal cues. Christi looks off stage for cues & change in  steps are shown in cartoon drawings. The steps they used looked like they were made in the '70's. Skip this one unless you want a good laugh.,1391472000,,203,4.205128205128205
8083963,5,B000B9WF0I,"Definitely a challenging step workout.  I think this would be a little difficult for someone new to step, but a good part of the video is teaching step by step.  In total I think the workout is about 55 minutes, and the rest is teaching.  I thought it was very fun.  I do wish the people in the video who are doing the simpler versions of the choreography would have at least one of them in front to follow, but other than that, it's exactly what I was looking for.",1370649600,,465,4.133333333333334
8083964,5,B000B9WF0I,"It may take a few times through to learn the moves, but otherwise this is a good step workout.  It's a lot of fun!",1360713600,,114,3.75
8083965,2,B000B9WF0I,"The advertisement for this program suggests Christi is a fitness expert, but the feel of the workout is more like your next-door neighbor decided to make a fitness video. While some people may like this informal approach, I found myself lacking confidence that her moves were really designed with proper knowledge of the human body. It was also quite inconsistent in level--the breakdown teaching session is too basic, then the dance segment is too fast. I didn't like the music, either, which was the reason I purchased this particular workout and which suggests that the music is drawn from chart-topping hits. It isn't. Most of it was written by her son--not bad for a young kid, but not chart-topping music and not what I thought was advertised. Compared to many other step and exercise programs I own, I thought this whole effort was below average.",1247616000,,853,4.889655172413793
8083966,5,B000B9WF0I,"I've been away from step for many years and many pounds :).  I was an intermediate/advanced stepper when I was last stepping more than 10 years ago. In an effort to get back into shape after having two children - one at age 40 - I decided to return to what I had loved all those years ago.

I read all of the reviews for this DVD and was not sure what to expect. While many clearly loved the challenge of the more advanced routines, many were also put off. I knew I would not be able to keep up with Christi, but was hopeful that the modified routine being demostarated by the steppers in the back row would be just right.  ...and it is just right!

I am very challenged by the modified routine but also have faith that over time (and with practice) I will begin to master the more advanced steps. I look at it this way...for the more intermediate stepper who might not get the difficult steps right away, this is like having two step DVDs in one!  As I get better, and that means better shape too!, then I can work on the difficult routine.  The added features on the DVD which not only include instruction on basic step, but also slowly demonstrate both the more difficult combos and the modified (more simple) versions of them, are quite helpful. I am more movitated by the recognizable music and have more fun. Even if I am flubbing the moves, I am still working, moving and sweating!

Don't shy away from this just because a few of the reviewers did not enjoy the difficulty level. If this out of shape 46 year old can start to get the hang of it, so can you!",1236124800,2,1564,4.245791245791246
8083967,5,B000B9WF0I,"I have just thrown out my VHS copy of this and replaced it with a DVD version because I wore out the VHS tape.  I love it and yes it's complicated and tricky, but if you know that going in, then it's not such a problem because then if you're an advanced exerciser and someone who is co-ordinated, then you'll be fine.  Don't purchase this if you have two left feet and you get frustrated quickly because you can't grasp the steps and if you aren't fit.
Christi is one of the absolute best instructors out there.  She is so much fun to watch and listen to.  She calls out the steps so fast and in time to the music and doesn't make any blunders.  She cues well so you know what's about to be next and that is a big help for catching on.  You move your step from width ways to length and use every inch of it.  All up, it's a little under an hour and it will get you sweating, puffing and burning tons of calories.
I really love this workout.  You shouldn't buy it if you are a beginner; you'll get yourself into a pickle and won't want to try it again.  If you give this a chance and tell yourself you'll just learn it in pieces over a certain length of time, you'll really enjoy it and have heaps of fun with it.  To me, it doesn't feel like a workout because it's so high energy and fun and I completely and highly recommend it.",1223683200,2,1329,4.057471264367816
8083968,5,B000B9WF0I,"Amazing and fun workout!! It will make you sweat!! I can not believe it got such a poor rating on Amazon! The only reason why is that the choreography is somewhat complex and only upper intermediate to advanced people or people who love dancey athletic style step and want to put in the time to preview it and learn it should buy this! This is an awesome advanced dancy/athletic step workout. This has a complex, yet incredibly fun and doable choreography. Christi is a master at this and at building up the choreography in a way that you're surprised that your doing it!! Incredibly, incredibly fun! This is a top of the line step workout and should be rated as such!! She is one of the best in the industry at choreography along with Amy Bento, Rebecca Small, Caroline Mervielde, Rob Glick, Gay Gasper, etc.",1218326400,5,809,4.586206896551724
