4331022,5,B004CZZYY6,"I believe this movie was made in 1956, please keep in mind that this was the time of the ""red menace"" and Communist USSR. People were scared silly because the government was telling them to be scared silly! Bette Davis plays a small town librarian and in her library is a book on communism, she isn't endorsing it just using it as a book of information. The town council gets complaints, orders her to remove the book and on general principle she doesn't and things go south from there. This is a definite statement on Government control and on censorship and so very close to book burning. As Benjamin Franklin said ""those who would give up their liberty for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" How true is that even now, think about it people.",1424995200,5,753,4.5851851851851855
4331023,5,B004CZZYY6,"This movie is little known and that's a pity. This is something I could watch over and over again. Bette Davis plays a librarian who will not remove a book from the shelf, even though it's Communist propaganda. People in the town complain about the book to the local politicians, so they confront her on it and ask her to remove the book. She refuses to budge, so they dismiss her from her duties at the library. A little boy who is close to her then becomes mixed up and is torn between his love for books and the librarian and what his parents/the local media/the townspeople say. He loses his mind, resulting in tragic consequences.

Anyone wanting a good review should not visit IMDB's message boards; too many there say this movie is awful. I don't know what they're going on. I guess they're too ignorant to realize that the Communist panic of the 1950s was very real and did indeed happen. This movie kept my attention when so many can't. I advise people to give this movie a chance. Forget the decade in which it was released, and forget the Communist angle. Even today, there are still those who would like to ban certain music, movies and books. For anyone who's against censorship, or a Bette Davis fan, or someone who loves books/trips to the library, this movie is a must-watch.",1400976000,4,1291,4.540772532188841
4331024,5,B004CZZYY6,"Betty Davis is a brave librarian who refuses to remove a book about communism during the McCarthy era.  This causes all sorts of havoc.

I got the book soon after I ordered it and in great shape.",1381104000,2,195,4.243243243243243
4331025,4,B004CZZYY6,"There is no mention of this film being remastered on the packaging itself, but Amazon's Editorial Review found above does state that it has been done.  I am pleased to say that the video and audio quality are indeed excellent.  My only complaint is the usual lack of extras on these overpriced DVD-Rs.  The only extra here is the theatrical trailer.",1322352000,11,349,4.688524590163935
4331026,4,B004CZZYY6,I had never heard of this movie before but I bought it because Bette was in it. She lives in a small town & she runs the public library. There is a book about communist that the town want's taken out of the library. She refuses. not because she believes in that but because she thinks any book should be allowed. And many years before she had joined clubs that it turn out the communist were behind. At the time she joined she did not know this but as soon as she found out she quit. But the town did not care about this. They branded her. There was a little boy that loved to read & was very close to her but he had a jurk of a father that did not want his son's nose in a book all the time so he bad mouth her to the son & he started to hate her. He got so angry he set the library on fire. Brian Keith played a man who it totally down on her also & did not bother to find out the truth & caused more trouble for her. Bette has her own way of talking & in the movie she is a very strong woman. And she is a believer also. She was also putting across the stupitidy of people who don't bother to find out the truth.,1311292800,20,1115,3.769230769230769
8424221,4,B004CZZYY6,"It was fun to watch the old black and white movie.  It was made during the McCarthy era as a warning flag.  Courageous, I think.  It was based on a case in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  The book (fairly recent) that tells that story is The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown.",1520294400,,264,4.326530612244898
8424222,4,B004CZZYY6,"Enjoyed the movie thoroughly since it was filmed in my home town and featured a 1956 High Schulze classmate.
Interesting parallel about McCarthyism of the 50's and it being mentioned in the news today.
Great movie.",1490572800,,214,4.972222222222222
8424223,1,B004CZZYY6,"This film was shot in 1.37:1 as was the norm in 1959.  It was most likely shown in the theaters in 1.37:1. Yet Sony Pictures has taken it upon themselves to cut 30% off the movie from the top and bottom so it will fill a modern widescreen TV.  The modern equivalent of Pan Scan. Horrible.  Let the true aficionados of the period see the movie as the director intended instead of pandering to the ""have to fill me screen' crowd who couldn't give two hoots about what the director intended.. Urgh..",1485475200,3,496,4.369565217391305
8424224,5,B004CZZYY6,Love the old Bette Davis Classics dvd plays well and meets expectations.  The dvd plays well and you can read the plot on wiki if you want to learn more.,1478736000,,153,4.1
8424225,5,B004CZZYY6,I had been looking for this film for ages and was so pleased to find it.,1477008000,,72,3.5625
8424226,3,B004CZZYY6,"It took considerable cleaning to make this DVD usable; it kept breaking up. Finally, I was able to watch it. It's an interesting picture, given the context of when it was made, and I admire Bette for trying. Many good issues are raised that are worth discussion; precious little discussion occurred. The film did not seem to want to delve into difficult issues too much.  It did, however, swerve into melodrama, and I was not convinced by the ending. However, I appreciated her character's sentiment about fighting back. It was a clarion call to the country. Unfortunately, the film was not strong enough, nor the country for that matter, to fight back at the politics of fear and demonization.",1461196800,,694,4.831932773109243
8424227,3,B004CZZYY6,"Storm Center, 1956 film

This drama discusses the controversy over censorship in a Public Library. Should books that were popular in the past be banned due to current styles or emotions? Actually, public libraries have limited space, they purge books that were not borrowed after so many years. Computers make it easy to keep track of borrowings instead of having someone check the cards kept in the back of each book. This movie does not specify the titles of the books, it is left to the viewers imagination. They ask the Head Librarian about the organizations she used to belong to; some were identified as Communist fronts! [No question about the social features of an organization. Were names used without permission? Did people believe in high-flying sentiments?

Should the Town Council remove books from the Public Library? [Is this micro-management?] If not, who is in charge? Tax-payer funded entities should be responsible to the voters. They fire Alicia. [Will she get a pension?] Alicia has the support of her friends. People show up for a meeting, many support her. But she tells them to accept her dismissal. People turn against her now (mass hysteria?). Rumors get passed around. One boy is rejected by his friends. People discuss the controversy. They built a Childrens Library and it is dedicated. Ellerbee brings Alicia to the ceremony. A young boy insults Alicia! [Who put him up to this?] Should people act even if the innocent suffer? Books are set on fire! A young boy is injured. The library burns, they show the book titles. [How many have you read?] Who is to blame? They want Alicia to help rebuild the library.

This message movie argues against censorship. Most books are produced by publishing corporations, an expensive business. Until the Internet it was difficult and expensive for an author to self-publish a book. The rise of E-books reduces the cost of publication. Old books can be found on Gutenberg*org. But fewer people read books than watch TV or movies. Digital TV has increased the number of sub-channels to allow many new stations with new programming to share limited frequencies. You can see many old TV programs and movies from olden days when they were in monochrome. What hasn't changed is theres still only 24 hours in a day.",1460505600,,2275,4.919270833333333
8424228,2,B004CZZYY6,Could not really get into this one with Bette,1441929600,,45,4.111111111111111
8424229,2,B004CZZYY6,"After watching ""Storm Center"" I am surprised it has such a good review rating on Amazon.  I thought it was one of Bette Davis duller movies.  She looks old (she is but looks even older in this film)...she is playing a librarian who runs the library (I thought it was funny that the very large sign on the building said ""FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY""...weren't they always free or at least open to everyone to use? She will not remove a book after being asked by an all male board for the library because it is a book about communism.  She is not a communist herself (she is accused of being one) but she does believe in free speech.  I thought this was a low budget movie...sound system is terrible and the photography was not interesting either.  No wonder this film never got mentioned when Bette Davis was interviewed.  I bet she thought it was a ""dump"" too.  It was the 1950's and Bette's career was not going well so she probably could not be choosy about the work she was offered.  I want to see all of Bette Davis's movies and I can now strike this off the list.  I saw it once and in this case, once is enough.",1439078400,2,1109,4.267942583732057
