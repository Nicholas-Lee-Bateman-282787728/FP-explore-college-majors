3994180,5,B002VBWH4S,My son enjoys this video.  The Mighty B's are a tremendous hit.  Good quality video for children's entertainment.  This was a good purchase.,1352764800,,140,5.0
3994181,5,B002VBWH4S,"How can anyone not love this extremely hyperactive over-energized girl who has no doubts about her ability to do whatever she sets her mind to?  Bessie is a good girl, and tries hard to do the right thing, help friends who are in trouble, motivate others to action when they feel hopeless, and she has a great sisterly affection for her little brother.  She's actually a very good role model for kids in a lot of ways. But, there are times when she simply goes way over the top into manic insanity. For example, her imaginary friend ""finger""..., literally it's her index finger on which she draws a little face..., and talks to as if it were a close confidant. And the conversations she has with her dog ""Happy"", I don't know if she's supposed to actually understand what his barks and growls mean or if she's simply being intuitive.

Bessie can talk a mile a minute and often leaves others winded just watching her in motion.  The writing is excellent, the sight gags are hilarious and the characters are unique and quirky.  The style of animation has a hand-drawn feel to it, not the stale and boring computer generated graphics so many new cartoons are using these days.  I highly recommend this series, it's something that both kids and adults will find entertaining.  The DVD worked perfectly, sound and visuals were excellent.
