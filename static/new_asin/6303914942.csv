739617,5,6303914942,"The story is very basic (woman with uncertain vision is chased by maniacal killer), but the characterization of the leading lady Emma (Madeleine Stowe), the hardened detective Hailstrom (Aidan Quinn) and her best friend (Laurie Metcalfe) is exceptionally quirky and fun. Emma is no fragile thriller victim, The romance is also very hot, but also a little rocky as two strong personalities collide. Emma (Stowe) is a blind, but very independent and fiesty, Irish musician in Chicago who lost her sight when her mother cracked her head on a mirror. The thriller begins when she regains her sight but needs time to relearn how to see. In this fuzzy period, she witnesses a murder, but doesn't realize it until she processes it later. Det Hailstrom is called in and soon the hunt and romance begin. We know that Det Hailstrom (Quinn) is attracted to her because he drunkenly strips down to his undies in a bar to get her attention (FAIL). Fortunately, he proves to be a better detective. This is a great movie because it gave Stowe and Quinn both a chance to move beyond their pretty-face roles and show their strength. If you like Stowe in Revenge or Quinn in Elementary, I really recommend this movie. Or just get it to enjoy the romance on a cold winter night.",1429833600,2,1259,4.701357466063349

739690,4,6303914942,"""Blink""(1994) is directed by Michael Apted (Gorillas in the Mist, Nell). This noir thriller stars Madeleine Stowe as a woman who has just regained her sight after an operation only to witness a murder. Initially she has trouble seeing and experiences vision flashes which give this film a somewhat hallucinatory/horror angle. Stowe's character plays the fiddle in a traditional celtic Irish dance band with the real life Chicago band (The Drovers) who contributed three songs to the soundtrack.

So-so movie. OK to kill time. It kinda reminds me of Silence of the Lambs. Female heroine has tragic past. Her past is exploited by the killer (yes there is one). The problem here is that the 80s gratuitous nudity is stage front. Aiden Quinn dances around naked. Women with their breasts hanging out are everywhere. Just gratuitous. Also, for me, the main character isn't someone I would necessarily route for . . . personality wise. Yes, what happened to her is tragic. But her personality is bad. It makes it hard to empathize with her. Perhaps that is the point . . . the handicapped are like everyone else. Dunno.",1388016000,,806,4.716312056737588

He has that suave, nonchalant way about him and he carries it to the screen. Being handsome doesn't hurt him either. I also like Madelaine Stowe in this movie.  She plays the part well and I like the way her distorted views are portrayed.  The story line is good and kind of suspenseful but not gross as some of the movies these days.  I appreciate the older movies for that reason.  Besides, my daughters are always looking for movies to watch so I decided to order this one because I thought they might also enjoy it.

739828,5,6303914942,"I am surprised at the weak reviews of this film. The storyline is excellent and contemporary, fusing modern medicine, clairvoyance, love, and police work. A woman, blind from an abusive mother from age 8, has her sight restored surgically after 10-odd years. Soon she begins seeing strange images, ranging from the abuse from her mother to a murderer of a tenant in her apartment building. At first everyone doubts her-friends, her doctor, and the police. As the situation escalates, opinions change as the killer strikes closer and closer to home. As she grows closer to the detective assigned to her case the images get clearer and stranger, and transcend the boundaries that separate the real from impossible, almost clairvoyant visions. It is a perfect blend of police work, psychology and modern medicine, swirling together into a bang-up climax. It's good, solid suspense at it's best. Madeline Stow and Aidan Quinn are great, along with a great supporting cast. A great yarn no matter what your preference in movies. Check it out-you'll see!",1333324800,,1048,5.098837209302325

739875,5,6303914942,"I recently purchased ""Blink"" from Amazon.com after seeing a trailer for it on [...].  In this movie, Madeleine Stowe, who is a very gifted actress, plays Emma Brody, a blind woman and talented violinist in an Irish folk band who has just undergone a corneal transplant to restore her sight, after she was blinded at age 8, when her horribly abusive mother smashed her face into a mirror.  The brilliant opthalmologist who does the transplant surgery is obviously in love with her and has been for some time; it would have been nicer if this relationship could have been explored more fully, as another reviewer wrote.

Emma witnesses a murder but because her vision is still not very clear, she does not make a credible witness when she goes to the police. The detective assigned to the case is John Hallstrom, who is played by Aidan Quinn. It's obvious he and Stowe get along in real life, as they have great chemistry and have starred in other movies together. The scene where Quinn and Stowe are in the coffee shop, talking, and the way he looks at her, is very powerful.  Despite his attraction, he is trying to remain professionally detached, but when he sees her having dinner with her doctor, his control breaks and he finally gives in to the attraction. The ending scene, in which he's standing and waiting for her, while bringing her dog back to her, and he tells her how he really feels (using lyrics she dared him to write), is outstanding.

I also think there is a deeper lesson in this movie: never take the gift of sight for granted, as it is precious. As someone who had LASIK vision correction surgery about five years ago (I could hardly see the big ""E"" on the eye chart before), I could really relate on a personal level to Emma Brody's coming to terms with finally being able to see. Of course, having a corneal transplant is much more serious than LASIK surgery, but nonetheless, I found the scene where the doctor removes the bandage from her eye, and she's touching his face and crying, very moving.  The first time I realized I could read the clock across the room without glasses, after 30 years, I started crying too.",1247443200,4,2142,4.579634464751958
739876,2,6303914942,"I loved this movie and it was great hearing The Drovers' music. I thought the CD of the movie's music would have more singing, but there is only a bit of singing at the beginning and end. Most of it is ""mood"" type music that served as the background to action in the movie, and this is not really music but just atmospheric stuff that is kind of slow and depressing. I think there was more singing in the movie. Maybe my expectations were off.",1231718400,,443,4.223529411764706
739877,3,6303914942,"Somehow I had missed this movie and only watched it today. ""Blink"" is actually a decent thriller that could have benefited with a more well-structured plot but what it fails to deliver in terms of plot development, it more than makes up by the strong lead performances by Aidan Quinn [Legends of the Fall] and Madeleine Stowe [Last of the Mohicans]. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable and well-done.

Madeleine Stowe plays a blind violinist who undergoes a corneal transplant and begins having weird side effects like delayed perception, and visions. When an upstairs tenant in her apartment gets murdered, Aidan Quinn, a Chicago cop gets assigned to the case and finds that a serial killer is on the loose. Both Stowe and Quinn's paths cross as Stowe is the only witness the police have and eventually a strong attraction develops between them. Things are complicated though for Quinn finds his integrity as the investigating officer on the serial case questioned by his deep involvement with Stowe.

There are some steamy scenes in here between Stowe and Quinn and are very tastefully done. Stowe's acting is above average, portraying an emotionally vulnerable woman who presents a strong and sarcastic facade to the world. Quinn is also good as the cop who battles his growing attachment to Stowe, whilst dealing with the demands of his job.

The weakest parts of this movie were the scenes of suspense - I felt that they could have been notched up a bit to truly evoke a feeling of menace, yet what comes across seems lacklustre at best. But, it is a decent thriller with an unusual twist and makes for an interesting viewing experience.",1215820800,,1644,4.885304659498208

739910,3,6303914942,"Blink (Michael Apted, 1994)

I'm still trying to figure out whether I liked Blink. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that I've never quite bought into the idea of Aidan Quinn as a leading man. There's something about him that doesn't quite work, and I'm not sure what. He's a good actor, though he often seems like he's playing the same character over and over again, but he's not the kind of guy who works as a leading man. I can't explain it. There's just something about him.

In any case, Quinn here plays John Hallstrom, a cop who finds himself on the trail of a killer. The only witness to one of his murders is Emma Brody (Closetland's Madeleine Stowe), a formerly blind fiddle player who just had a cornea transplant, but is still not seeing the world around her too well. Worse, Hallstrom, who was attracted to Brody back when she was blind, finds that now she's starting to return the feelings.

As with any generic Hollywood cop film, the dialogue is heavy on one-liners and other general silliness, which helps balance out the Aidan-Quinn-je-ne-sais-quois factor I can't get past. The unfortunate bit is that it never goes much farther than that-- not surprising given screenwriter Dana Stevens' more recent output (Blink was his first screenplay that made it to the big screen) The other thing that does is Madeleine Stowe, who's one of those dead-sexy Hollywood types who never managed to latch onto roles where she'd be playing someone who's dead sexy. If you're a Stowe fan, you definitely want to see this flick. Anyone else... not too sure. A good way to kill an hour and a half, but not much more than that. ** ",1198108800,3,1642,4.555932203389831

When a girl that was blinded by her cruel mother as a child is given her sight back as an adult, she starts a new life. But while her eyes are adjusting to the change she sees a murderer in her building. She then falls in love with the detective that doesn't believe her story. As he comes around to it, the case develops and we see how the murders tie together and we fear for more than just Stowe's character.

739914,3,6303914942,"If you're looking for a decent thriller to watch for a couple of hours then Blink is a good choice.  It's not a spectacular movie, or one which you would probably want to watch again and again, but it is entertaining and worth seeing.

The best thing about this movie is Madeleine Stowe playing the blind woman, Emma Brody, who is given a transplant operation to help her see again.  While her sight is returning she witnesses a murder committed by a brutal serial killer and becomes his next target.  Stowe plays her character really well, making the blind scenes look genuine and making you care about her future.  Aidan Quinn was OK in his role as Detective John Hallstrom, the police detective investigating the serial killer case who (surprise, surprise) falls for Emma Brody.  My main problem was that Hallstrom's role wasn't really appealing to me.  He was an extroverted womaniser before he met Emma, and he never really matured from this point.  In the first scene of the movie Hallstrom gets drunk in a bar and tries to get Emma's attention, not realising that she is blind.  I thought Hallstrom seemed like a moron in this scene and it didn't really bode well for the rest of the film or the developing relationship between them.  I was actually much more intrigued by Hallstrom's police partner Thomas Ridgely, played by the quieter James Remar.  The only problem with Emma's character is that the story demands that she does a couple of silly things, such as slipping away from her police bodyguard in the middle of the night and other unnecessary actions that nobody sensible would do when being hunted by a killer.

The plot is pretty standard stuff although it is shot well and the acting is good.  The murderer never seems that scary until the final couple of scenes, when he becomes much more realistic.  Overall, this is a good film and I recommend it for people looking for a decent thriller with a romantic subplot.  It won't blow you out of the water, but it will keep you happy enough while you're watching it.",1172188800,9,2033,4.65546218487395
739915,3,6303914942,"This is a thriller that has an intriguing plot. A beautiful fiddler, Emma Brody, blind since the age of eight, gets a corneal transplant twenty years after the domestic tragedy that robbed her of her eyesight. She then regains her eyesight, in a manner of speaking. It is a work in progress, and she is only able to see shadowy or distorted images. She also suffers from some sort of delayed or retrograde reaction to what she sees. So, images she sees today are really things that she may have seen the day before. This becomes particularly problematic or disconcerting when she becomes the only witness to have seen a killer shortly after a murder took place in her apartment building.

Naturally, the police are a little skeptical about her value as a witness. Having been blind for so long, however, her olfactory ability is heightened, and she is able to provide another valuable clue as to the killer. This becomes important, as the killer strikes again and again. The Detective assigned to the case, John Hallstrom, the precinct's self-proclaimed lady killer, becomes smitten with her, much to his surprise, as he has tended to be a love 'em and leave 'em type of guy. She, in turn, bitter because it was her mother who had blinded her, is initially unreceptive to his charms. When each is willing to drop their cynical, public personas, they find that their inner selves mesh, and they fall in love. Unfortunately, Emma is in acute danger, as the killer has a definite agenda, and Emma appears to be at the top of his list.

Madeleine Stowe is excellent as the beautiful Emma, giving her a hard-edged exterior while not losing her vulnerability. Aidan Quinn seems a little bit like a fish out of water as the rude, crude, and lewd Detective Hallstrom. It is only when his character falls in love with Emma that Quinn seems to come alive in the part and feel comfortable. It is then that he hits his stride. The love scenes are passionate and inspired.

The rest of the cast gives competent performances, but the film never hits the level of suspense that one anticipates. The serial killer is a murky character whose raison d'etre is ultimately skimmed over. The sub-plot involving a potential romance between Emma and her eye surgeon sort of collapses onto itself, leaving the viewer to wonder why it was interjected into the story in the first place.

739917,4,6303914942,"I enjoyed this very much.  Of course, I have always loved Aiden Quinn, a Chicago boy who's been around a long time, and who I last saw in that great Friday night TV show that, drats, got cancelled, about a minister and his family.  He was wonderful in Barry Levinson's ""Avalon"", and Madelaine Stowe was in Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" as Tim Robbins' wife.  They both fit together well here, even thought she exudes more class than he.  There's something so ""homebody' about Quinn.  This was his first big lead, and he handled it well.  The romance is great.  Much like ""Wait Until Dark"", yet Stowe is far from the hapless woman.  She is very feisty, very strong.  The ending was sappy, but the rest was good.  Filmed in Chicago.  Look of the picture was dark and gritty - very film noir, except for the ending which was filmed in morning light.  To be fair, the Chicago Tribune critic didn't think Quinn's cop was written as effective at all - that he was completely inept.  Maybe I missed something, or she knows more about police work than I, or am I just lured by his blue eyes?  SPOILER - ---  And I couldn't quite follow the leap Quinn made as to the murderer being after victims who had transplants from one girl.  How did he get to that? -------",1142467200,6,1253,4.406113537117904
739918,4,6303914942,"A brilliant performance from Madeline Stowe elevates BLINK in an otherwise slow moving, at times muddled, movie.  Stowe plays a blind violinist who receives a corneal transplant that results in her having delayed perceptions, that is seeing things that may have happened a day or so before.  This involves her in the murder of a young woman who lives above her, and ultimately brings her to meet Aidan Quinn, an egotistical young detective, who is assigned to the case, and ultimately ends up falling in love with her.

Michael Apted's direction sometimes gets in the way of true suspense, the middle of the movie seeming to slow down, and the killings take second place to the love affair.  A red herring is thrown in and you might swallow it, but the identity of the killer once revealed may come as a surprise.

Stowe and Quinn have a good chemistry and good support comes from James Remar and Peter Friedman, but it is Madeleine's marvelous performance that enlightens this film.",1100649600,17,983,4.792899408284024
739968,3,6303914942,"This is a thriller that has an intriguing plot. A beautiful fiddler, Emma Brody, blind since the age of eight, gets a corneal transplant twenty years after the domestic tragedy that robbed her of her eyesight. She then regains her eyesight, in a manner of speaking. It is a work in progress, and she is only able to see shadowy or distorted images. She also suffers from some sort of delayed or retrograde reaction to what she sees. So, images she sees today are really things that she may have seen the day before. This becomes particularly problematic or  disconcerting when she becomes the only witness to have seen a killer shortly after a murder took place in her apartment building.

Naturally, the police are a little skeptical about her value as a witness. Having been blind for so long, however, her olfactory ability is heightened, and she is able to provide another valuable clue as to the killer. This becomes important, as the killer strikes again and again. The Detective assigned to the case, John Hallstrom, the precinct's self-proclaimed lady killer, becomes smitten with her, much to his surprise, as he has tended to be a love 'em and leave 'em type of guy. She, in turn, bitter because it was her mother who had blinded her, is initially unreceptive to his charms. When each is willing to drop their cynical, public personas, they find that their inner selves mesh, and they fall in love. Unfortunately, Emma is in acute danger, as the killer has a definite agenda, and Emma appears to be at the top of his list.

Madeleine Stowe is excellent as the beautiful Emma, giving her a hard-edged exterior, while not losing her vulnerability. Aidan Quinn seems a little bit like a fish out of water as the rude, crude, and lewd Detective Hallstrom. It is only when  his character falls in love with Emma, that Quinn seems to come alive in the part and feel comfortable. It is then that he hits his stride. The love scenes are passionate and inspired.

The rest of the cast gives competent performances, but the film never hits the level of suspense that one anticipates. The serial killer is a murky character whose raison d'etre is ultimately skimmed over. The sub-plot, involving a potential romance between Emma and her eye surgeon, sort of collapses onto itself, leaving the viewer to wonder why it was interjected into the story in the first place. Moreover, it is a major ethical breach for a detective to become intimately involved in a love affair with a witness in a case being investigated by that detective.

739969,1,6303914942,"This film had great potential but was ruined by non-heroic and even pathetically unsympathetic characters. ""Blink"" is about a blind woman who undergoes a corneal transplant and meets the murderer of her upstair neighbor the first night home from the hospital. She is still half blind but she is the only witness.
Before this premise starts to interest you too much, please note that the investigator given us to solve the murder first encounters the blind woman while he's doing a striptease for his buddies when she's playing the violin at a pub. And who was he trying to attract: this well-groomed, perfectly coiffed blind lady with a perfect body who goes around asking questions like: ""Am I pretty?""
Her mother pushed her face into a mirror when she was playing dress-up so now she is a harridan prone to tantrums, drinking, and acting out dependency issues, none of which is ever presented as qualities in need of psychotherapy (which they all are) but presented as NORMAL. Our hero, the drunken detective, finds these qualities ""fascinating"" and falls madly in lust with her. When is an irrational, emotional, yowling female throwing things ever anything BUT fascinating!
Yet her doctor has fallen in love with her too! Rather than having us focus on the murder conflict, we get two pedestrian love-interests on which to focus during the muddled middle of this twisted train wreck of a film. You'll almost forget there was a murder and a few good scares in the beginning. Her psychiatric therapy and subsequent medication with anti-depressants would've been much more interesting, dramatic, and realistic.
Can people really behave like this and expect to solve murder mysteries, play the violin, and heal the blind! Am I supposed to care about such unrealistic and fake people! Anyone of them could have been run over by a Cadillac and I would've cheered. The only character in the film I liked was her seeing- eye dog and HE was the one who was hit by a Cadillac!
By the end of this bilge the investigator, rendered impotent at solving the crime by his immaturity and poor taste in ""fascinations"", winds up the doormat for the irrational, emotional, blind vixen after she finds and kills the murderer  herself. But by that time you'll be mopping up spew and have completely forgotten the cool premise that made you watch this film in the first place.
Whoever came up with the original premise deserves 10 stars. The writers who fleshed out the characters need to take some advice: We the audience are not the idiots you think we are! We can't sympathize with someone because she is blind if she is an irrational harpy making stupid decisions. We don't buy it that such a shrew can be found ""Fascinating"". We can't admire people who put ""play"" before work and ""play"" before ""plot"". We can't accept as sympathetic a disabled character disabling those who are trying to do their jobs, help others as well as herself. This makes it too evident that she is reducing the world to her level so she can function on higher planes of existence. This serves no one's interests. Don't try to cover this up by portraying the character as self-sufficient when the whole crux of the story hinges on the fact that she is not yet completely competent and has even more issues to overcome psychologically than physically. Sorry comrades, but you just can't pull it off!
What we have here in ""Blink"" is a film so bad you'll have to scrub the stains out of the whites of your eyes with laundry soap. But then...you'll go blind. That's probably the entire point. Wink Wink.",1071532800,4,3559,4.777597402597403
739970,3,6303914942,"Blind musician gets her sight back just in time to witness a serial killer strike.  Unfortunately, the lead now suffers from visual agnosia (meaning that her mind is no longer used to seeing things)  so there is often a delay between the actual event and her mind processing the image.  So she doesn't realize she is a witness until several hours after the attack.  While the skeptical police work to catch the killer, the death toll mounts and ultimately a mysterious connection is found between all the victims.  Now the killer returns to snuff out the one witness who has seen him and lived.
I would have to say that this was average to possibly a little below average except I really enjoy the Irish music that played on the sound-track.  This was a very typical 'cop meets semi-helpless woman in distress and believes in her when no one else does' film.  I liked it and I liked the music and if you like this sort of movie then this is a movie you will like.",1054166400,7,963,4.4375

739972,4,6303914942,"It's true that the story may stretch your willingness to believe at times (though it seems that the ""delayed vision"" phenomena is accurate),  what makes this a really good movie is the quality of the acting.  Aidan Quinn and Madeline Stowe create real people in this movie - people you could readily run into on the northside of Chicago.  There isn't a false note to their performance.  The same can also be said for the supporting work of James Remar.
Add to the quality of the performances the visual feel of the movie - Michael Apted has put together solid visual effects with a great and realistic vision of Chicago.  This isn't the standard lakeshore/magnificant mile plus generic city that you usually see.  This is the Chicago of the neighborhoods.
Finally, the music for this movie introduced me to The Drovers - a Chicago band that is absolutely brilliant.  If you're anything like me, the day after you watch this, you'll be out hunting their cd's.",1018483200,14,958,4.734939759036145
739973,3,6303914942,"As thrillers go this is above average.  True, the premise is a ""been there, done that"" sort of thing with a romance between the detective and the potential victim with a serial killer in the shadows, etc.  However there is just enough originality here added to solid performances by the stars to make it worthwhile.
Aidan Quinn (no relation to Anthony) plays a cute and quirky detective in the Windy City on the trail of a budding serial killer.  Madeleine Stowe is a blue grass/Irish violinist blind since she was eight.  As the movie opens she is about to get cornea transplants, and before long she can see, sort of, which is important since she has become a witness to murder.  Some of what she sees are flashbacks to the day before, which makes her a problem witness for the police.  Some other flashbacks are to when her mother smashed her face into a mirror for playing with her make-up. How sick is that?  I presume this was dreamed up by Dana Stevens, who gets credit for the script, which is a kind of mishmash of clever lines and shlock dialogue as though two different people (or half a dozen) wrote it.
Michael Apted's direction is not inspired although it isn't all that bad either.  But he doesn't develop the serial killer's personality, and so the weirdo's motivation seems a bit of a stretch.  Also undeveloped is the doctor whose love for Stowe is unrequited.  The main thing is the erotic chemistry between Stowe and Quinn, and the personality of Stowe's character, which is original and the best thing in the movie.  I think this would have received a better reception had Quinn's character fallen in madly in love with the violinist.  As it plays, we are not sure whether he really cares or not.
Madeleine Stowe is sexy and does a good job in a demanding role, probably the most demanding of her modest career.  See it for her.",1002585600,23,1849,4.566666666666666
