It explains the dynamic of how three brothers built a private paramilitary force that reached 10,000 men and how this force has fought the communist guerrillas but also became s threat to the Colombian state as well. Colombia has endured more than 50 years of civil war, one of the oldest in the world only paralleled by Burma and Congo. This series is awesome.  I'm glad I'd now in dvd format",1438387200,,560,4.802083333333333
