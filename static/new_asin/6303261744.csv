615231,5,6303261744,"I am a devotee of films and something of a Schnitzler scholar. This film represents a major nexus of my interests. I know the play ""Reigen"" (""La Ronde"") very well -- my translation of it was produced by San Diego's Old Globe Theatre some years ago. Ophuls's film of the play is superior in every way. True, it is in French, the original language having been Schnitzler's superb German, but the script has not suffered at all, probably because the Viennese sensibily is not that far removed from the Parisian. Those who produce ""La Ronde"" usually feel compelled to find some framing/transitional device to bridge the episodic nature of the play, and that chosen by Ophuls is highly satisfactory  (Anton Walbrook's resemblance to Schnitzler himself doesn't hurt). The cast is the finest available in France at the time (1950), combining established stars with up-and-coming players like Simone Signoret and Serge Reggiani. Criterion's DVD transfer upholds the high standards one has come to expect from that fine label.  I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the best of continental theatre, or just entertaining movies.",1234569600,4,1125,5.108695652173913
615232,5,6303261744,"A chocolate confection of a movie.

Set in Vienna circa 1900, based on a play by Viennese playwrite Arthur Schnitzler, it's a series of vignettes more about lust than love. The vignettes flow together by having one person appearing in the next -- generally being the seducer in one, the victim in the other.

As I understand it, Ophuls moderated the promiscuous tone of Schnitzler's play. There is definitely a sense of regret and loss over these random flings despite their inevitableness.

Still, the tone is mostly light, almost flighty at times. There's a master of ceremonies (Anton Walbrook) holding the entire thing together, as well as a pretty melody by Oscar Stauss. There are even the daring intrusions of moviemaking -- a clapboard, a filmstrip with the presumed sex scene being cut out -- and, one time, a hugely amusing bit of symbolism with the merry-go-round.

As with LE PLAISIR, many fine French actors appear. Sometimes, the same ones. Danielle Darrieux (at her most beautiful). Simone Simon. Daniel Glin. Jean-Louie Barrault (a little over-the-top). Simone Signoret. Grard Philipe (a beautifully nuanced performance).

It is elegant, witty, but a little passe: Movies have come a long way since in ""letting it all hang out"". Some of the episodes are not fully developed and look more like first drafts.

615234,5,6303261744,"This 1950 film was considered quite scandalous in its day especially in America. The essential premise of characters having sex without marriage shocked conservative moviegoers even though it was done with wit and style and doesn't show you anything improper. It was based on an 1897 play by Viennese doctor turned playwright Arthur Schnitzler called REIGEN which created even more of an uproar back then. Adolf Hitler considered it absolute filth.

I first saw this film back during my college days and dreamed of playing on stage the narrator who is interactive throughout the story. Imagine my surprise when I obtained an English copy of the play and discovered there was no narrator in it! The filmmaker had created the character to enhance the film and indeed he does. As played by Anton Walbrook (the impresario of THE RED SHOES), he is the epitome of Old World grace and charm and has the best lines as well. No wonder as he is supposed to be the alter ego of the director himself.

The title REIGEN (ring or circular movement) refers to the nature of the play where one character has sex with another who then has sex with someone else and so on until, coming full circle, it ends with a final character having sex with the first one. All of the encounters take place off camera and there are even amusing attempts by the narrator (who introduces each character) to occasionally censor the action. The symbol of this ""circle of love"" which occurs throughout the film is a carousel or merry-go-round.

The film was made by Max Ophuls, a German filmmaker who wound up in France by way of the United States. His films are famous for his continually moving camera and interesting visual compositions. He was reportedly Stanley Kubrick's favorite director. Aside from the Austrian born Walbrook, the film features the top French acting talent of the day including Danielle Darrieux, Jean-Louis Barrault, and just starting her career, Simone Signoret. The celebrated music, including the LA RONDE theme, was composed by Oscar Straus (no relation to Johann).

I could go on and on about this film but I'll restrain myself. The simplest thing for you to do is to go out and rent it to see for yourselves and I wouldn't be surprised if you wind up buying it. Of course it is ""old-fashioned' filmmaking. It's in black and white, has elegant tracking shots, and is full of characters who have something to say (even if it's in French) which means its appeal will unfortunately be limited to those who prefer more ""upscale"" fare. Yet if you take the time to sit back and take it in (and that's important), then you'll be amply rewarded. It's a film you may find yourself returning to again and again. This Criterion edition is beyond reproach.",1223683200,6,2739,4.76
615235,5,6303261744,"A classic ""round"" of vignettes, each about love, each vignette blending into the next by means of a single character, like passing a baton in a foot race, until we're back at the beginning again. It begins with a young prostitute (played by Simone Signoret) meeting a soldier (Serge Reggiani) and ends, after about six vignettes, with a different soldier (Gerard Philipe) paying a visit to Signoret. All of it is held together by a raconteur, played superbly with just the right amount of sardonic wit by Anton Walbrook, who steals the picture.

Max Ophuls's production is very stylized, with rococo turn-of-the-century sets. It's light and witty, but insightful, too, with the emphasis on the fleeting aspects of love and the vanity and double standards held to by the male of the species. The movie has everything going for it: a brilliant idea, a wonderful script, great acting, and terrific camerawork. Movie-making at its finest. [It was banned in America for four years on obscenity charges: the women enjoy their illicit love affairs a little too much for the censors' tastes at the time.

615236,5,6303261744,"""La Ronde"" succeeds on many levels.  The screenplay, adapted from the play by Arthur Schnitzler, is witty and provocative.  It has a lightness of touch and delicate irony that is peculiar to the French.  The performances are excellent-especially Danielle Darrieux's portrayal of an adulterous wife.  However, the real distinction of this movie is it's visual style.  The black and white cinematography is anything but flat. There are layers and textures in this film that are a feast for the eyes.  The sumptuous set decorations are beautifully ornate-almost baroque.  ""La Ronde"" is replete with camera angles reminiscent of ""Citizen Kane.""  There is a fantastic overhead shot of a young courtesan whose head is in the center of hanging light fixture-or chandelier.  This aspect is that of a poet who is idealizing her.  It is an absolutely brilliant moment.  Ophuls has a wonderful sense of movement.  The long tracking shots and circular motion complement, instead of detract from, the action and emotion of the story. Particularly dazzling are the carousel scenes where circles run counter to one another.  One might say that the omnipresent narrator is rather intrusive, but he grows on you.

7842410,3,6303261744,"This film comprises a slightly depressing and excruciatingly repetitious series of 11 vignettes ostensibly about love, but really about the superficiality and transitoriness of sexual attraction and sexual trysts.  I loved this film when I first saw it years ago, but I cannot recall or fathom why.  I am reading a book on neuroscience, Behave, by Robert M. Sapolsky, which perhaps explains why I like this film less at the present time: ""This is our world of habituation, where nothing is ever as good as that first time.""

However you may find it difficult not to think you are in Paris with such flagrant French accouterments throughout.

Our charming narrator is omniscient. He sees all and all knows all and manipulates our players at will. He turns up in different guises and moves the story along with flair and finesse. Wise, witty, he's the perfect accessory to the tales, along with the spinning carousel. We're guided through unfoldings of passions and desires both trivial and overblown, but all run their course and won't last more than one encounter.

The film does what it's supposed to do. Entertains, comments upon, and points out the artificiality of many human interactions especially those that have to do with seduction / ego / pleasure / flirtation. Not so much about sex actually, as the facade of performance.

Max Ophuls directs. Cinematography is by Christian Matras. A bevy of then up and coming as well as seasoned actors round out La Ronde for a solid viewing experience.",1497744000,,1141,4.963350785340314

Criterion always does a superlative job on their releases. HOWEVER, I have one significant bone of contention with them on La Ronde. The translation from French to English. I am referring to the last lines of the film sung by Anton Walbrook. In the Criterion translation, he finishes with something like, ""....and that's all there is.""  It sounds like a throw-away line. This is not how I remember this being translated in any release print I had seen in the previous 35 years or so.
I replayed the ending back on the DVD numerous times. It seems he is clearly saying in French what I remember the previous translations said, ""This is the story of the whole world. This is the story of you and me.""
The effect of these lines at the end of the film is heart-grabbing. The present throw-away line is disturbingly ineffective, significantly undercutting the profundity of the film.
I can't imagine how the translator could have gotten it so wrong. That is why I have given one of my all-time favorite films only 4 Stars.

7842414,4,6303261744,"""La Ronde,"" (""The Merry-Go-Round""), (1950) is a steamy little French film masterpiece in black and white, telling a convoluted tale of interlocking sexual relationships, as on a merry-go-round, in a tight 93 minutes.  It is a BAFTA (the British Oscar equivalent) Best Film Award winner, directed by the well-known German-born director Max Ophuls (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Plaisir/dp/B001BEK8BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Plaisir</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earrings-of-Madame-de/dp/B001BEK8C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earrings of Madame de...</a>).  The film was based on a notorious play by the Viennese doctor Arthur Schnitzler, set at the turn of the 20th century, as was the original theatrical entertainment.  It's a lovely, lyrical romantic comedy that comes to us from an incredibly rococo, lush Vienna, decorated to within an inch of its life.  The movie is told in a series of vignettes, in which a new character has an affair with one from the previous scene, eventually bringing the story back to its beginning.  The vagaries of life are such that Schnitzler's play is now best known to audiences worldwide by this French film made of it by a German director.

 The attention paid to recreate Vienna 1903 is remarkable, and gives us a very convincing facsimile of the city. Insofar as French actors go, the film is pretty much an all-star production.  It opens on Leocadie, a prostitute who enjoys her work, played by Simone Signoret (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casque-d-Or-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0006HC0GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casque d'Or: The Criterion Collection</a>); she takes home Franz, a soldier, for free (Serge Reggiani, CASQUE D'OR).

Director Max Oph&uuml;ls was known for his circular camera movements and his obsession with detail.  His films often dealt with women coming to terms with their romantic illusions.  He was born Max Oppenheimer in Germany, and began his career as a stage actor and director in the twenties. He soon began to work under the pseudonym Max Oph&uuml;ls, the name of a distinguished old German family. In the early 1930s Oph&uuml;ls began to work as an assistant to film director Anatole Litvak.  Around 1933 Ophuls fled the Nazis and immigrated to France. In 1941 he immigrated again, this time to the United States, where he worked for 10 years before he went back to France in 1950.  He was voted the 39th greatest director of all time by ""Entertainment Weekly,"" and is the father of the noted French director Marcel Ophuls.

Arthur Schnitzler was the scion of two prominent Hungarian/Jewish families of doctors.  He was born in Vienna, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and became a doctor himself in 1885.  He worked at a major Viennese hospital for a while, but eventually abandoned medicine to write full-time.  His works were often controversial for their frank description of sexuality (The Viennese father of psychiatry, Sigmund Freud, in a letter to Schnitzler, confessed ""I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition -- though actually as a result of sensitive introspection -- everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons."")  Schnitzler was attacked as a pornographer after the debut of his play Reigen, upon which LA RONDE is based.  The furor after this play was couched in the strongest anti-Semitic terms; his works would later be cited as ""Jewish filth"" by Adolf Hitler.  Ophuls' films were all about charm and elegance, two qualities LA RONDE has in spades.  The material of this film is not nearly as shocking as it was once considered; believe me, we routinely see much more so today.  Try it; I think you'll like it.",1307577600,,5712,6.5471447543160695

7842416,4,6303261744,"This is an immensely cynical movie that looks at sexual liasons through a very jaundiced eye. The idea is simple. We see several vignettes depicting men and women in fleeting sexual situations. One party in each encounter then goes on to feature in the subsequent vignette until the circle is complete.

The action is set in fin de siecle Vienna, although the setting is pretty irrelevant. The action is choerographed by a world-weary circus master played by Anton Walbrook. He introduces the guiding metaphor of a carousel -- which briefly breaks down when one of the male characters fails to perform in bed -- one of several witty moments.

The weird character angles and recurring images of bars express the social constraints which imprison all the characters. In one of the brief affairs, a young, spoiled rich boy seduces the willing maid. The camera is always looking down on him surrounded by bars as if he was a baby in a play pen. The other recurring image is of veils. The characters are constantly photographed through veils, suggesting their inability to truly connect.

Despite all these interesting features, modern viewers may find the depiction of women a little jarring. There is no attempt to depict women as equals. As wives they are possessions; as mistresses they are toys. Some of the women manage to level the playing field to some extent through their wit but still the battle of the sexes is by no means a fair fight.",1264896000,3,1443,4.810483870967742

7842418,5,6303261744,"LA RONDE (1950) Starring Anton Wallbrook, Simone Signoret, Simone Simon (from Cat People) Fernand Gravey and Danielle Darrieux.  Directed by Max Ophuls.

Well, this was quite the film.  There is much here to enjoy.  Beautiful, poetic, witty dialogue.  Breaking down of the fourth wall.  Strong female characters that revel in their sexuality and the power it has over the men in their lives.  Scenes of passion that build slowly, almost in a suspenseful manner.  Lots of thoughts by the characters about the nature of love and casual sex, marriage, infidelity, and even women who, while not using the ""contemporary term"" indulging in a ""friends with benefits"" situation with other men.  This is definitely a dialogue driven film, but it is beautifully delicious, witty, thoughtful and passionate dialogue.

The film starts with our mysterious puppet master/raconteur played by Anton Wallbrook.  His entrance is terrific.  Walking the foggy streets of Vienna, he engages the audience immediately by asking us what part he plays:

""What part do I play in this story?  Author?  Accomplice?  Passer by?""  As he soon reveals...""I am you...I am the personification of your desire to know everything""

His clothes are contemporary, but he slowly starts to change his clothes to become more ""period friendly"".  As he starts to blend in to his surroundings in almost a chameleon like fashion (which he does periodically throughout the film) he asks the audience...

""But just where are we?  On a stage?  A film set?  One doesn't know any more.""

It's dialogue like this that slowly transports us to an almost magical place that seems both real, and not real.  This gives the film a wonderful element of fantasy.

As it turns out, we have been transported to 1900 Vienna.  As our Raconteur happily conveys...""Ahh, the past.  I adore the past.  It's so much more peaceful than the present and so much more certain than the future""

It's dialogue like that that drew me into this film immediately.

Soon, the mysterious puppet master takes us to a rather magical merry go round which is the engine of the film.  It travels in a circle, or ""La Ronde""  as does the films plot.  Connecting all the vignettes of stories of love and affairs.  As the narrator turns the merry go round, a prostitute mysteriously appears.  Wallbrook leads her off of the magical carrousel and tells her that she will meet a soldier which she does.  They make love in a dark alley.  He must leave her to return to his barracks on time or else he forfeits his weekend leave.  This is the beginning of the first segment of the film ""The Soldier and The Girl"".  After their tryst, we go to the next segment in the series of tales...The Chambermaid and The Young Man.  In this segment, the soldier meets a girl at a dance.  As he leaves for war, they continue to write.  Meanwhile she gets a job as a chambermaid for a rich couple and their very attractive son.  This scene is very steamy indeed.

Each segment features one person from the previous story having an affair with the next person and so on and so on until the story returns to the first character.  At the end of each characters ""coupling"", the Raconteur's marry go round starts turning to lead us to the next story.  While we don't see any actual sex, we see characters entering bedrooms, and many scenes of blissful, post coital conversations that are very funny and full of wit.  Simone Simon is wonderful as the seemingly innocent maid who under the surface is boiling with passion.  However, the scenes with Darrieux  is the real attraction in this film.

It is unabashedly sexy, scandalous, romantic and just plain fun.  Walbrook doesn't just tell the story, he sings it.  He manipulates the characters, leading them to their respective trysts, as well as running interference to protect those trysts and to champion the illicit love that permeates the film.  While it seems very adult in its subject matter, it is filled with a delightful mood and playfulness.  It's almost disney'esque with its light hearted, playful tone and in its very esoteric storytelling.

From the opening credits when we hear the music, it sets a tone of fun.  The music by Oscar Straus is also very exceptional in how he captures the mood of playfulness of the characters and actually is able to augment the suspense we feel when we wonder ""will they or won't they"".  The cinematography is top notch by Christian Matras.  The film is so fluid and surreal in its transitions from scene to scene.  Each segment starts with a level of slight uncomfortability which then melts into a passion that both parties are more than willing...no..desperate to engage in.  It's a beautiful film visually, full of the cream of the crop of beautiful French actresses who are extremely talented and fascinating to watch.  I couldn't take my eyes off of this film and enjoyed it just as much on second viewing.  This film is about a wonderful love of life, passion and sex.  With wonderfully fleshed out women who aren't clichs or ""sleazy"" but simply looking to escape the mundane and to seek, voraciously, all that love, life and passion has to offer them.  It's sexy, witty and just plain fun.  Everyone in the film turns in a great performance.

Some of the segments move faster than others to be sure.  Very slickly produced and very enjoyable.  I've never seen anything like it.  However...I can see how the people who enforced the code at the time made it difficult for the film to get any sort of wide release in the US.
