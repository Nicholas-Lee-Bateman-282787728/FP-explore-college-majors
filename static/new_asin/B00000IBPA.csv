1222123,5,B00000IBPA,"This is one of those ground-breaking titles that redefined anime in the Nineties for Japan and the rest of the world.  A deliberate attempt to unite the categories of anime geared toward teen boys and teen girls, it succeeds by making a virtue of necessity: what was intended as a 39-week TV series had to be jammed into a 26-week time slot.  As a result, a lot of information is jammed into a limited space, which gives a sense of ""world-building"" that rivals the heftiest novels of George Martin or James Clavell.  The clash of kingdoms is placed on the shoulders of a high-school track star, who finds a hidden connection to the alien realm where she turns out to be the key to war or peace.  The extras include a performance of songs by Maaya Sakamoto, the voice of heroine Hitomi and a pop singing idol in her own right.  The songs and background music were written by the creative voices of Yolo Kanno and Hajime Mizoguchi, which are part of the series' appeal.  The major flaw is technical.  This set collected discs that were originally sold singly, and the tedious step-by-step navigation shows it.  Still, having the entire panorama is more than worth it.",1402185600,,1165,4.621359223300971

She discovers the truth about Gaea, it's connection to Earth, and her hidden powers. Hitomi will never be the same again.

This anime is a classic. It has a great story, good animation (for 1996), decent voice acting, and a great soundtrack. I totally loved this anime up until the last 5 episodes or so. Until then, the story was epic, dramatic, and engrossing. When the end was in sight, you could almost see the epic battle, heart breaking farewell, and the loss of loved ones. Nothing like that happened. The final battle just sort of stopped in the middle, the characters just kind of said see ya later, and there was no dramatic death or triumph. It burned out slowly like a cheap sparkler. I know that people aren't gonna like me saying that, but it's true. I've seen harem animes with a more touching conclusion.

Don't let that stop you from checking this series out though. Even though it ended weak, the rest of it was really good. I strongly recommend it. The prices I'm seeing for it are awful though. There is no way a series this old is worth $40. I wouldn't give any more than $25 for it. If you can find it for that, then go for it. I think that just about every anime fan can find something to like about Escaflowne. It's worthy of being called a classic. No matter how M. Night Shyamalan-ish the ending is.",1358812800,2,1663,4.431372549019608

The best thing about this anime is that is has a little something that appeals to both genders. Action, adventure, duels, romance, knights and princesses, you name it, this show has it.

The audio in the English dub is a bit lacking though. I had the volume turned almost the entire way up and I still had a hard time hearing, even when I plugged in some headphones on my laptop.

1222158,3,B00000IBPA,"I won't bother telling you how good the series is; you can read the 5 star reviews for that.  However, I will say that I didn't love the ending.

This review is about this DVD set.

The Good:

This 8 Disc set comes in one double sized DVD case - that's pretty compact.

Japanese audio is nice and clear, high quality, and the translation for English subtitles is halfway decent, which is really good for a DVD set (fansubs, my basis for comparison, are much better).

The video is DVD quality, as expected, and that's where the good stuff ends.

The Bad:

1) WRITE PROTECTION
You have to decrypt each disc (DVD Shrink, CloneDVD, etc.) BEFORE you can encode the show to another format (HandBrake, AutoGK, etc.)  Why would you want to do this?  For example, I encode all my DVD shows to m4v format and host them on an Air Video server for streaming to my iPad.

2) 4.5GB DISCS
With 9GB discs, they could have either doubled the audio/video quality OR cut the number of discs down from 8 to 4, which would have allowed them to use a (more durable) single DVD size case and saved them money on materials and labor.  Not to mention, less discs for us to deal with!

3) CHEAP CASE
The front cover and back cover of the double-sized case each hold 2 discs, while the two-sided centerpiece holds 4.  This centerpiece snaps into two plastic retainers, which each consist of two very thin lips.  One of the lips on the bottom retainer on my case was broken in shipping.

The Data:

This series aired long before the Golden Age of 16:9 high def video, so the show is drawn in 4:3 aspect ratio.  If you decrypt and encode it to a format for viewing on the iPad, it displays perfectly in full screen.

Anime Legends has this set for $10 more.  I'm pretty sure it's the same audio and video data, but based on a review I read I think they packaged the set better.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escaflowne-Anime-Legends-Complete-Collection/dp/B000E8NRNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escaflowne: Anime Legends Complete Collection</a>",1342137600,2,2060,4.814814814814815
1222159,1,B00000IBPA,"I realized that in my first review of Escaflowne, I could have done better with the reasoning as to why I don't like it, so now here's a better review for all of you.

Even after watching this back in June of 2012, I still don't know why people love this anime so much.  It just feels like another hokey fantasy story that other than a few neat ideas, doesn't do much to break the mold of so many fantasy cliches that I'm not a fan of.

STORY

The story to Escaflowne is that a schoolgirl in Japan named Hitomi Kanzaki is on her highschool track field one night and sees a vision of a young man named Van Fanel fighting a dragon.  She's soon taken to the world of Gaia and shortly after her arrival to this planet, she sees Van's kingdom fall after being attacked by the Zaibach Empire.  Soon, Van and Hitomi escape in a giant stone mecha called Escaflowne and go through Gaia to find a way to stop the Zaibach Empire from destroying the other kingdoms on the planet.

TONE

Originally, I thought the tonal shifts were the main reason as to why I hate this anime, but after some deeper thought, realized they're much smaller in the equation as to why I'm not fond of Escaflowne.

While the tone of Escaflowne far, far less uneven from the likes of Elfen Lied, Fullmetal Alchemist, Trigun, High School of the Dead, and Witchblade, still had some moments that I felt were pretty unfitting.

I get that Escaflowne is supposed to be more light-hearted anime fare, so I guess the more ""goofy"" visuals during the humorous scenes are supposed to be more fitting, but this balance gets a little rattled during a few fight/action scenes where you see whole kingdoms getting incinerated and some people getting killed, complete with bloodshed.

CHARACTERS

Honestly, the characters are a bit of a mixed bag.  I'll be frank here and say that I hate the catgirl Merle, who's Van's companion.  She's such an obnoxious little twerp.  I get that she's supposed to provide comic relief, but she's not funny at all.  As someone who loves cats, even I wanted to tie a concrete block to Merle and drop her into Lake Michigan.  Protagonists like Van Fanel, Allen Schezar, Princess Millerna Aston, and even Hitomi have some pretty interesting profiles and I found the agony in Van and Allen's pasts pretty engaging.

While I appreciate the efforts of the creators to come up with some villains containing depth, I won't give them points for this because the execution was poorly done, and in some cases, felt pretty forced.  One of the main antagonists is a Zaibach teenage warmonger named Dilandau.  Dilandau was loathsome for all the wrong reasons.  You're supposed to loathe a villain for doing awful things to innocent people, but I flat-out detested Dilandau solely for the fact that he sounds so annoying you'll be grinding your teeth to the point to where you need some major oral surgery.

Folken Fanel is the other main antagonist and is actually Van's older brother.  While a more interesting villain that Dilandau, Folken suffers from bad writing as well since like Dilandau, so much of the series paints him as a loathsome creature and it's not until around the last 5-6 episodes is he seen with any moral depth to him.  Because this takes place so late in the series, the inclusion of moral depth doesn't feel like it's meshing with Folken's character.

STORYTELLING

After thinking about it some more, I think Escaflowne's ultimate downfall is the way it tells its story.

What annoyed me so much about this anime is that the storytelling methods for it really aren't above the clich tropes and some illogical absurdities that are among the main reasons why I tend to stay away from fantasy media.

There's plenty of deux ex machina scenes in this anime, which I think get really tiresome, and as far as I remember, don't even have a proper explanation as to why some things even happened.  One example is that around the middle of the series, Van manages to slay Dilandau's Guymelef pilots, and before Van can slay Dilandau, the souls of Dilandau's fallen brethren put Van in a state of stasis.  Nothing else like that happens again in the series and no explanation was given as to how that could happen.

My final example is an extremely absurd revelation about Dilandau that's so goofy and forced near the end that you'll probably laugh unintentionally when you see it.

APPEARANCE

The animation and artwork for Escaflowne is actually very well done.  So much of the animation feels smooth, and the art direction for the world of Gaia looks like what a fantasy world should look like, in that there's influences from a fairly wide array of ancient cultures instead of just relying on Medieval Europe and possibly Nordic paganism as sources of inspiration in the world's architecture and people (this is a problem that I see plagues most fantasy media).  Some places, like Van's kingdom of Fanelia, manage to mesh visuals from both ancient Europe and Japan, which I thought was pretty neat.
However, the creature designs are mixed.  There's a good deal of anthropomorphic creatures in Escaflowne, and while some look like something you'd see in a more serious fantasy tale (such as antagonistic catgirls Naria and Eriya), some others look like bad scribbles from the character designer's sketchpad.  Examples of this would be some chameleon men and the Mole Man featured in this anime, as their goofy looks don't fit at all with the way the other characters look.  I'll say that the designs for the Draconians were a bit interesting, if not too inventive.

There's stone mechas called Guymelefs, and the designs for these are actually pretty impressive.  I was especially impressed with the Escaflowne's transformations from an upright machine into a mechanical dragon.  However, the Guymelef designs for Naria and Eriya gave me some bad flashbacks of those obnoxious puma sisters from Dominion Tank Police (an ""anime classic"" that I find much less tolerable than this, but that's another kettle of fish).

SOUNDTRACK

Many have sung praise to Yoko Kanno's soundtrack for this anime as if it could heal amputees and make the blind see again.  I think Kanno's soundtrack is...merely okay.  The Gregorian chants and orchestral pieces were fairly nice to hear, but I ultimately found them forgettable.  The intro music is fairly decent for a pop tune, since it feels quite mellow and its atmosphere fits pretty well with the context of the show.  The outro's techno backbone feels a bit off compared to the rest of the music in this anime.

FINAL WORD

If you're a big fan of fantasy fiction and many of its typical storytelling methods while also being an anime fan, you'll probably love Escaflowne.  However, if you're like me and find many of the typical storytelling tropes in the fantasy genre irritating, then you probably should avoid this.",1340064000,2,6840,4.769753610875107
1222160,3,B00000IBPA,"Seeing as how this is an anime classic I might get some hate for being the lowest review on this series thus far, and I'm sure that at its time, it was fantastic compared to the anime that was out.  I read on someone elses review that this was originally planned to be 36 episodes and I must say, I think that would have been for the better.  Lets get to the review!

For books and movies my new formula is character, plot, action, delivery and charm.

Let us start with the characters of the series.  There are a few that stood out to me as being good, and throughout this whole review I will try to avoid spoilers.  Van, Fulcan, Merle, and the protagonist Hitomi were the standouts to me.  The latter two get very annoying at points in the series though, which is a downfall.  There is Alan, who is a cool knight character, but is pretty much flat.  Sure, he has a mysterious past as a few characters in this series do, but just because you tack a mystery on a character that doesn't make them more effective.  The characters in this anime are average to a little below average for my standards in media.  Other than the rare few I named, there is no depth really.  They just did a bad job developing the characters.

The actual plot of Escaflowne is fantastic.  It definitely involves a lot of 'out there' fantastical elements that unravel as the story goes along so I will not touch upon it, but if you are a fantasy fan you will definitely get your fill in the plot department here.  I have some problems with it that I will touch upon more in the delivery section, but for the actual written story, great plot.

Action is next.  By action I am not implying just combat, I mean parts of the show that are there to keep your attention to the plot and the characters.  This could mean a romance or an action scene.  This show suffers from what I like to call the witholding.  We're supposed to believe that one character loves another from them just being around each other, never sharing a romantic moment or showing interest in each other.  The only time that the show ever explicitly implies a possible love between the two characters is when one is jealous the person is with another.  Overall, I feel the romance and personal relationships in the show are either rushed too fast or left hanging way too long.  As far as actual action scenes, the series has some really good ones in the beginning and the end, but the middle kind of falls apart.  The shows comedy bits with the comedy relief characters work very well compared to the rest of the action.

Delivery of this series is my biggest gripe.  The first third of the series is pretty damn fantastic in my opinion, it had me on the hook.  From there it starts going down hill.  As previously mentioned, multiple flat characters and action that just doesn't work makes the delivery fail in many instances.  There are some plot lines involving a whole nation that are resolved in just one to two episodes.  There is one episode in particular that has a very climactic battle with what in any other series should be a very emotional event, but because of the failure in delivery, I was left not really caring that much about what happened.  I really feel that if this had been 36 episodes instead of 24 they would have had much more time to show deeper characters, develop action better, and effectively have a better show.  Also as the four star review pointed out, this could be due to a bad english dub as well.  While the voice over didn't particularly stand out as horrible to me, it definitely wasn't fantastic, and great voice actors compared to okay or good voice actors can make a big difference in the impact of a show.

This show does have a lot of charm though.  The animation, the music, and the world all come together.  Even though the characters eventually fall pretty flat, I liked the show enough to push myself through it.  If I had watched this when I was younger or when anime itself was younger I'm sure I would not have been as critical, but to say this is a 5 star anime is a joke.  Obviously these are just personal opinions so don't hate on me too much for this, just keeping it real.

If you have nothing better to watch Escaflowne is a decent anime with good ideas but ultimately a failed delivery.  Worth a watch, but not an anime that after watching it I feel I need to have on my shelf.  For those of you who disagree with me and want to know what animes I felt were damn good, I would name Wolf's Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist as two of them. 2 1/2 stars: If you are sitting there looking at this item and wanting to find a good anime to watch, you should not regret if you pass it up.  This is not an anime that is a must see.",1326153600,6,4718,4.326879271070615

1222165,5,B00000IBPA,"I was an anime fanatic in the turn of the century in high school. Recently I have began to return to watching anime after almost ten years. This was the first series I remembered. One thing I found after all these years is that the cartoonish cheezball scenes do nothing for me anymore. Escaflowne is serieously a work of art in the anime world; for one that it rarely has these scenes. It is truly epic. It does not interrupt the captivating epic story by having the characters become cartoons with some cliched squiggle above their heads in some random goofy scene.
That rant aside, it is truly a masterful series that does not need to be confined to anime. The art is unique and visually beautiful.
It's ironic that it is technically the cliched anime fantasy story of an average high school girl getting whisked away to a fantasy world. But the manner in which it is carried out is genius. Every character has a part and is memorable. Although Hitomi is the main protagonist, there is sort of a triple protagonist dynamic going on between Hitomi, Van, and Allen.
The story is very moving and quick. The music is absolutely fantastic.
I refuse to even see the movie because it supposedly ruins the characters and compresses the story. I honestly do not need a retelling of this great series.
So for you young anime fans looking for a good 90's series, this is, in my opinion, the greatest series of that decade next to Cowboybebop.

1222171,1,B00000IBPA,"I have seen Escaflowne in both Japanese and English. In the Japanese the main character is Hitomi, but in the English version they butchered the series beyond belief to make Van the main character, to make the show more appealing to boys. That ruined the point for me.

The English opening is cool, but the rest of the series is ok, not great but ok.",1279929600,4,350,4.384615384615385
1222172,5,B00000IBPA,"As many people here all ready did a great job of summarizing the plot of the series I won't go into that. So I will just give my personal opinion on how I feel about it. This anime is one of the best shows I have ever seen. It has great story and awesome music. Escaflowne was the first anime series  I have ever seen back when it was still on Fox network and now years later after seeing close to a 100 different anime I still think its one of the best a classic that everyone should watch at least once. From the very beginning, Escaflowne achieves the feeling of escaping to a fantastic world with large heaping spoonfuls of pure atmosphere, action and drama that you would not want to miss. So buy it and give it a try you won't regret it.",1277337600,8,743,4.124137931034483
1222173,5,B00000IBPA,"This is one of my favorite shows ever (tied with the anime version of the Count of Count of Monte Cristo).  It is an epic story with an addictive soundtrack, memorable characters, with a dash of philosophy (though it is lost in the English version).  The story is a coming of age story of a high school girl (Hitomi), who is torn away from the world she knew and is stuck in the harsh and war-entrenched world of Gaia.  She must help a new set of friends save Gaia from destruction in order to stay alive and find a way back home to earth.
Also, to make the show more enjoyable (though I have not confirmed this in any way), the show seems to be, in part, a sort of commentary on WWII. While this is not the point of the show, it seems to be the backdrop of the world of Gaia, and will keep you busy trying to see the parallels.
Anywho, it is a great fantasy story, with epic music (thank you Yoko Kanno!), rich characters, and a certain other-worldliness that will take you a way for a while.
The version I bought was a knock-off copy, and had bad video encoding.  The audio was all fine, which is important for the music.  The English voice cast is ok, with the exception of the main character who is so over emphatic that it feels like it should be a VO for telletubbies or something, so don't even bother.  Also, the video would be more enjoyable with better encoding, so it may be worth the extra money to buy the official version instead of one where all episodes are on 3-4 discs.",1269820800,,1487,4.21830985915493
1222174,5,B00000IBPA,"The Vision of Escaflowne's story is not new. Girl comes in contact with strange world, discovers ancient mysteries and forgotten technologies, has a protracted tease-relationship with the prince, there's mechas and cool fights, flying ships, etc., etc. You've read, seen and played this before. Story archetypes are so cliche as to have been explored and classified for a long time now so truly there's nothing new under the sun.
However, as the creators seem to know, it's in the *telling* that legends are made. And what telling this is! Its beautiful, shoujo style contains character archetypes which get deconstructed into nuanced, real characters as the show goes on. The valiant prince, the dashing rogue, the schoolgirl ingenue, the bloodthirsty youngster; all get a realistic treatment in a fantasy world. Even class issues feature prominently in the arc of one of the characters but I don't want to spoil. The humongous mecha (robots) also get the realistic-within-the-fantasy-world treatment and the relationship between Van and Escaflowne becomes like the relationship between King Arthur and Excalibur: it's both the source of his power, his birthright and ultimately, his burden.
The music, like any Yoko Kanno soundtrack, is a fantastic thing unto itself. From the gregorian chant-style, mood-setting main theme to the dramatic, urgent, almost screechy violins and subsequent thundering of drums and voices of the battle music, the soundtrack has a bit of everything. I was especially touched by Folken's theme, a simple cello melody which becomes more complex in a crescendo of notes and ""Blue eyes"", the love theme which gets both instrumental and sung renditions throughout the series. The opening song, one of my favorites, is as bright and hopeful as it gets without being corny. Maaya Sakamoto's singing in these two is expert and restrained, very enjoyable.

In short, this is a great anime series, certainly one that winds up in a lot of those ""must-see"" and ""classic anime"" lists. It's also a fully-contained work in itself, the vision of a director which throughout its 26 episodes keeps you on your toes constantly and just when you thought you knew what or who was behind it all, another great twist puts everything in context. You won't be disappointed.",1265587200,2,2280,5.195652173913044
1222175,5,B00000IBPA,"I am always on the look out for really good anime and I vaguely remember seeing part of this movie, but I was unsure at the time.  I took a chance and decided to buy the complete set and loved it.

The really enjoyed every minute that I did't want to stop watching for even a minute.  The funnt part that really had me really paying attention to the voices was when I heard Miroku's voice from the TV series Inuyasha.  I couldn't beleive what I was hearing.  Hitomi's voice also had me thinking that she sounded a lot like Songo from Inuyahsa also.

The story line was pretty amazing and it really sucks you into the characters.  Sometimes I would get annoyed with Van and him not admitting that he cared a lot fro Hitomi, but in the end he was the only one that had a serious connection to her and always would.  I'm a hopeless romantic so it really kinda got to me that 1) Van and Hitomi never kissed.  She kinda kissed Allen and was in his arms on more than one occasion; 2)she leaves him and doesn't return to him, but she is able to see him briefly with wings and pendent showing; and 3)she has a thing for Armono and it seems as if he has a thing for her too, but apparently he doesn't and he looks like Allen.

Overall, I loved the series and it was beautifully drawn and portrayed in this series.  Highly recommend this story.",1263513600,3,1334,4.192156862745098
1222186,5,B00000IBPA,"When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...

What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...

If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).

Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece ""Dance of Curse"" for instance. It reminds one a lot of ""Duel of the Fates"", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode ""mystic eyes"". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.

Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escaflowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.",1256515200,46,6098,4.755429650613786
1222187,5,B00000IBPA,"Visions of Escaflowne is my favorite anime (along with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Rurouni Kenshin).  Although Escaflowne features mechas, it's quite different from your Super Robot and Real Robot shows.  If anything, Escaflowne is a blending of different genres including action, adventure, romance and fantasy, all in equal measure...  And that's probably Escaflowne's strong point.  It's one of the most well-balanced anime titles out there.  You'll be hard-pressed to find another anime that blends so many different genres together.

The atmosphere in Escaflowne is also incredible.  The series has a deep mystical atmosphere that completely absorbs your attention.  If you're a person who loves exploring mystical and exotic things, the atmosphere in Escaflowne will blow you away.  It's by far the most atmosphere mecha anime i've seen.  The soundtrack (done by the same person who did Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack) is one of my favorite soundtracks in an anime.  My favorite track is the one that Folken whistles when he meets with Van (""The Cradle Song"").  You should definitely check this track out on youtube to get a sense of the Escaflowne's amazing soundscape.  It's one of the very few anime series that i've seen with lots of heart.  Escaflowne is simply beautiful.

So if you're looking for a mecha series filled with tons of adventure and fantasy, you can't do better than Escaflowne.  Not since Xenogears (an anime-ish mecha RPG) have i encountered a mecha story filled with so much adventure.",1255305600,,1509,5.199170124481328

Since that time, I have watched many more anime, and believe me when I say you won't be forgetting this one anytime soon. For all those years that I didn't own this anime, I'd remember it and think on it; for it has many interesting points to think about.
  This anime would be for any age. It has the action, romance, and poetry for the younger kids, and the subtle messages and all of the above for the elder.
The packaging that the anime comes in isn't the best out there, but it is quite durable if you're careful with it. Hopefully you are. ^o^
  Oh yeah, I would recommend that you watch this anime in the original Japanese with the English subtitles. The English voices, I think, don't have enough emotion in them to do the anime justice.",1250899200,,852,4.3734177215189876
1222190,2,B00000IBPA,"A friend of mine lent me his store-bought copy of Escaflowne on VHS tape, and I sat down and watched it.  I thought it was a typical anime, but nothing outstanding.

A year passed and then I found the reviews here on Amazon about how this is ""the perfect television show"" and how it deals with complicated political issues, and so on.  So I sat down and watched the whole show a second time, thinking maybe I had missed something.

Well I'm still unimpressed.  It isn't a bad show, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but it isn't a great show either.  In fact it seems rather juvenile and simplistic in the way it deals with problems - something akin to a CW teen soap opera but with Japanese style.  In any case, twice viewed is enough for me.  I won't be watching Escaflowne again.

In my humble opinion if you're looking for depth (in terms of politics, religion, and interpersonal disputes), then you should look elsewhere like Star Trek DS9 or Babylon 5.  Or if you prefer animation then try Macross.",1242864000,6,1015,4.379679144385027
1222191,4,B00000IBPA,"Escaflowne Complete Collection is an eight-disc DVD set that contains all twenty-six episodes of The Vision of Escaflowne.  The first two discs each contain four episodes and bonus features.  The remaining six discs each contain three episodes and bonus features.

The bonus feature on the first disc is four music videos for The Vision of Escaflowne (a textless version of the opening theme, ""Friend,"" ""Blue Eyes,"" and ""Into the Light"").  This feature runs for about thirteen minutes.  On discs two through seven, the bonus feature is ""Club Escaflowne.""  These are interviews with voice actors, production staff, and the writer and director for The Vision of Escaflowne.  These interviews run anywhere in length from eight to twenty minutes.

The final disc in the set contains three bonus features.  The first is labeled as ""Playstation Game Footage.""  This runs for about eight minutes, and is comprised of what appears to be ""cut scenes"" from the Escaflowne video game.  The next feature is a roughly two-and-a-half minute trailer for Escaflowne: The Movie.  The final feature on the disc is a five-minute concert video for Maaya Sakamoto performing at a special concert at a screening for Escaflowne: The Movie.

While I understand that this box set just gathers up the eight individually released discs into one collection, I wish more effort had been taken to put this set together.  It would have worked better if they had tried to get more episodes onto each disc, and then focused the bonus features on one or two discs.

There have been some times where upon finishing a series or a movie, I would get a bit disappointed that there would be no more. After watching Escaflowne, I had felt it.

It is hands down far out. The storyline had me bedazzled throughout the series. The storyline is a very, very emotional experience (though I thought that it was a bit too frustrating at times)... I would say at the same level as that of Gundam. The animation was also captivating. The artists really thought things through when illustrating the massive Guymelefs (mecha); the physics of their movement was extremely life-like, contributing to the spectacular fight scenes.

Just to give you an idea of my taste in animes, I will leave you with a list of where it stands among my favorites (in no particular order) to lt you gauge it for yourself...

- Robotech (Macross Saga/Invid Invasion)
- Gundam (MSG, SEED to name a few)
- Cowboy Bebop

- Bubblegum Crisis

If your looking for an anime worth the money and your time this is it. You will defintly watch this more than once, and find yourself telling others about it.

1222223,4,B00000IBPA,"Having watched the entire series, I can only say how wonderful it is.  The characters have interesting backgrounds and promising futures, the story line is unique and keeps you involved from episode 1-26 and the animation is imaginative and well executed.

The story begins with young Hitomi, a girl in high school that is a promising athlete and has managed to catch the attention of another popular young athlete, Amano.  However, Hitomi is not entirely pleased with her life here on Earth.  She longs for something else.  She gets what she wants, so to speak, when a young man by the name of Van Fanel is transported from his world to hers while fighting a dragon.  After the dragon's defeat with a little help from Hitomi, her and Van are transported back to the world known as Gaea, where the Earth and the moon hang in the sky.  The story follows Hitomi and her adventures with Van in Gaea, the young king of Fanelia and their attempt to stop the plans of the evil Zaibach empire with the Escaflowne, a giant mecha directly linked to Van.

This is the story of Escaflowne and, as you can see, it is very interesting.  The DVD casing is also cause for a good rating as it is easily portable in two thick cases that hold 4 separate discs in each.  My only complaint and the reason for this anime only receiving 4 stars is for its ending.  It's posotively disastrous.  Well, perhaps I am over-reacting, but, in all honesty, it was a total let down.  It just didn't seem over and the themes which were pressed so strongly during the series were lying helplessly in the background.

Overall, though, a wonderful anime and well worth the price.  I will watch many times for the years to come...except for the ending.",1176595200,3,1716,4.543973941368078

1222225,5,B00000IBPA,"...Which to me is a very good thing, because that means that it appeals to a broader audience. Both male and female audiences enjoy this anime. =) And with good reason--not only is Escaflowne considered a 'classic' amongst the animes out there, but it also has amazing mecha battles (and designs!), characters with depth, an intriguing and very complete world in which the characters live, and the plot twists and turns all over the place.

I won't swear it's the 'best anime ever'--being quite a fan of anime in general, I couldn't choose only one for a favorite, nor I think should you have to--but it's enjoyable enough to watch again and again that I bought the boxed set, and that's saying something for somebody who is a penny-pincher like myself.

If/when you watch this anime, be sure to pay attention in particular to what I think is one of the most convincingly-portrayed insane people in any anime--Dilandau Albatou. He's not just nuts, he's nuts in a way that makes him enjoyable to watch. I can't quite explain it--you'll see if you watch it. ^^;

As for the physical product itself--the Anime Legends Complete Collection DVD boxed set--it's contained in two thick DVD plastic cases which are held together by a cardstock slipcover.

I think I should note that the DVD cases' ways of holding the DVDs in are refreshing--you press down in the centers of them and they loosen and then when you press the DVDs back in they fasten again, eliminating that difficulty I had with getting the discs out of the cases in my other boxed sets (such as Fruits Basket's). That means that it's very easy to get the discs out of the case without damaging them, but they're also not coming off of their nests in the case just by being shaken around. It's the best of both worlds!

The cardstock slipcover will get beaten up pretty quick if you carry this set around a lot, but I've carried it back and forth between my house and a friend's at least seven times now and the slipcover seems okay. It may be more resilient than it appears.

The sound, imagery and extras I found to be complete and as excellent as expected. The subtitles are well-done and well-timed, the Japanese and English language tracks both sound great, and in general this was an excellent purchase for me that I'm very happy with. <3",1168473600,3,2301,4.627450980392157

1222227,4,B00000IBPA,"Like most good animes this series has a lousy ending.  The mastermind behind  the super cool ninja cloaking mechs?  Isaac Newton . .  But barring the crappy ending, it is a classic and worth watching.

Who should buy this? If you liked gundam, record of lodoss war, beserk then this anime is for you.",1166054400,3,300,4.481481481481482
1222228,4,B00000IBPA,"I watched (and liked) the movie, but it didn't leave room for a -good- series to follow or preceed it, so I didn't hold out high hopes for this. When it was available cheap, though, I decided to pick it up - and I'm very glad I did.

This is another version of the same story told in the movie, so treat the two as separate. It brings in Mecha, but not as a dominant feature, as well as aspects of starstruck romance, love triangles, and a bit of fantasy intrigue, blending them into a consistent story. I do think parts were a bit drawn out, and the Isaac Newton reference was a bit silly, but these weren't enough to bring down the story. On the other hand, the characters are multifaceted, bringing a healthy range of emotions into play without seeming forced or trite.

I mainly took off a point for the artwork and the plot being drawn out at points. The artist doesn't know how to draw a nose (can't say I do either, but I'm not selling my work), which becomes obnoxious at times.

If you can get past the noses, it's well worth a look.",1162080000,7,1042,4.226130653266332
1222229,5,B00000IBPA,I was one of those unfortunate enough to catch Escaflowne on fox kids. Truth is that I was hooked. It was one of the first anime I ever saw before I even knew what anime was. I didn't get to see the whole series on fox but I always wanted to see the whole thing and I finally got my chance. This series is truly a gem among anime. It's got a heartfelt story with some action thrown into the mix as well as a bit of comic relief thanks to Merle. True that the characters look a bit funny but that's only at the beginning after a while you completely forget about it and fall completely in love with them flaws and all. It really has nothing in common with the movie other than that the characters are the same so if you didn't like the movie give the series a chance. It has a more fully developed story and really fleshes out the characters better. I enjoy watching dubs so I watched it both in it's original and dubbed. The japanese is great and cant be compared with the subbed but if you are to lazy to read than the dubbed version is fine as well. Plus you get all of the episodes for such a great price. How can you beat that? If you're in the mood for a great story definetly buy this.,1153872000,6,1191,4.029535864978903
1222230,5,B00000IBPA,"Escaflowne was probably the first anime show I ever watched!  I was instantly hooked and just had to buy it now even though it's been several years since I saw the show.

It's about a 15-year-old girl named Hitomi who gets transported to a mystical world called Gaea.  There she teams up with a king, a knight, a princess and others to save their world.  It's hard enough being a teenager on earth, but being a teenager trapped on another world, well, you can tell that she'll have difficulties.  Not to mention love interests.  The fight scenes are good, and I love all of the creative characters such as Merle the cat-girl!  Buy it and you won't regret it!  It's a great show!",1153785600,3,678,4.455284552845528
1222231,5,B00000IBPA,"When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...

What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...

If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).

Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece ""Dance of Curse"" for instance. It reminds one a lot of ""Duel of the Fates"", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode ""mystic eyes"". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.

Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.",1150934400,93,6098,4.755429650613786

Escaflowne features a fantasy story of a normal teenage girl named Hitomi. She is taken into a distant world called Gaia in which the Earth is known only as the Mystic Moon.
After meeting Van Fanel, a young swordsman with an amazing secret (ok, I'll tell you --- he has wings!), a rich plot begins to develop. Romance that is not sappy, a plot that is not cliche, characters that are interesting, tragic, and wondrous....
This anime is beautiful.
From the music to the story to the entire atmosphere of this enormously entertaining and instantly classic anime, Escaflowne shines. It is a series not lacking in any area, and the fantasy/futuristic feel is an interesting and unique touch. With robotic battles, sword-sparring, games of fate, tortured pasts, torn loyalty in romance, and winged people(!), the sheer ingeniousness of this series will blow you away.
The winged people are an amazing touch... they are not cliche or even angelic, just surprisingly well-done for such a common anime characteristic.

This is perhaps the best anime of all time.",1074211200,5,1255,4.869158878504673

1222247,5,B00000IBPA,"Many people will throw around compliments like ""The Best"" rather easily, and change their minds like the wind. I dislike using that level of description, because usually there's several things competing for that position.
Not, however, in the case of anime series. No series I've ever watched -- and I've watched a lot of them, from Mobile Suit Gundam to Harlock to Metal Fighter Miku and Space Adventurer Cobra -- comes close to matching Escaflowne.
Visually, Escaflowne is stunning. Most series animation is clearly inferior to that found in anime movies, but in the case of Escaflowne it's hard to recognize that this is, in fact, a series. The backgrounds, the main characters, the action, all are done with a warm, lush attention to effect that never fails.
The music is one of the finest anime soundtracks ever made. Composed by Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop), it captures a spirit of mysticism and high adventure which is perfect for this series. I often leave this disc running in the background because it's so much fun to listen to.
The story... how can I do it justice? The best way to put it is this: for the past several years I have done a monthly anime night at our local Borders, and Escaflowne is the ONLY anime to consistently pull in people of all walks of life. I've seen it enthrall Dragonball Z fanboys, Sailor Moon addicts, 65-year-old grandmothers, 7 year old little brothers, casual Yuppie passers-by, and cynical goth poseurs. It has magic and war, politics and romance, intrigue and action, swords and giant mecha suits, and somehow all of it works to form a dazzling coherent whole that is unmatched in all the history of animated television.

1222249,5,B00000IBPA,"Have you ever watched a series end and just wish that there was more?  Somewhere in my heart, as I finished watching the last tape, I had hoped that this would lead into yet another series.
If you are even thinking about buying this then listen:
Picture a girl of innocence and hope just discovering her fist crush.  Picture a boy set on conquering destiny and saving his land.  A man who's honor is his life and who finds his heart torn in a million directions. An enemy who knows his fight is wrong and one who has yet to realize that.  Now place that in a setting where both fantasy and sci-fi meet and you have the tip of where this goes.
I'm not going to tell you what happens, because that would ruin the movie.  What I can say is that the story has depth.  It isn't the easiest to understand, but its worth taking the time to try.  The people are complex and dynamic, learning from their mistakes and being human in their errors.  The villains are true to life, being merely people with different goals and not just evil. They have their honor and their own courage and in their own way they are nearly as epic as the heroes.  There is love told in a way that makes it all seem possible.  It takes you to the brink of imagination and leaves you out there, making you believe that somehow this might all be possible.

1222284,4,B00000IBPA,"...Apparently, Mr. Merritt was somehow under the impression that Vision Of Escaflowne was supposed to be a shoujo anime-- and it definitely is not. Characters like Merle add shoujo elements to the series, but overall, Escaflowne is more of a dramatic series than anything, and this becomes obvious two or three episodes in. If you're looking for a shoujo series, go watch Card Captor Sakura (NOT the butchered US version that Fox is showing, but the original), or Fushigi Yuugi.
If Escaflowne isn't a shoujo anime, what is it? That's easy-- it's an awesome, medieval series, with mechs thrown in for good measure. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than Neon Genesis Evangelion (which DID have an ending, just not a conventional one), but it comes close. The character design is excellent, the story is great, and moves at a fairly brisk pace, and the ending is thought-provoking but manages to give you closure at the same time (which, admittedly, is something that Evangelion wasn't able to do until the release of End Of Evangelion).
One thing that has bothered me in reading reviews of this series is that a lot of people have problems with the noses of the characters. Frankly, unless people hadn't made such a big deal out of it, I wouldn't have really noticed it, and I think it's a fairly absurd thing to pick at. People have no problems with giant mechs, or cat-people, but if their noses look a little funny-- THERE'S a deal-breaker.
Escaflowne is one of the best series out, period. If you miss it, you're missing out on an incredible epic. But if you do watch it, do yourself a favor, and pick up the subtitled version-- which is a good rule for any foreign series or movie, really. The dubs are  almost always abhorrant.

When I first saw this anime, I was awed by it. I couldn't stop watching it. It reminded me so much of fantasy books I'd read but then it didn't resemble anything I'd ever read (or seen) before. I got lost in the magical world of Gaea.  Following Hitomi and her friends as they discovered many things about each others' lives. I found myself cheering them on.
It appeals to all ages (young adult and up) and any gender. The fighting for the males and romance for the females, many different things mixed together to appeal to both genders. Ever seen medieval surroundings mixed with technological mecha? Do you like anything to do with the supernatural? Must I ask you about knights and princesses? The plot is so vast making you wonder what will happen next. It asks the question, ""Can you really change fate and what would you do if you could?""

However, I would try to avoid the dubbed version...what little of it I've seen has been fairly chopped up, with overall badly chosen voices, and the addition of some where ""techno-esque"" effects that just get annoying.  I strongly suggest that if you insist on watching this version, that you also see the original, ""real"" version of it as soon after as possible.  Its like reading the book after seeing the movie.",972086400,2,771,4.723880597014926
1222312,5,B00000IBPA,"When I saw an episode of Escaflowne on Fox I thought, ""Magical girl meets mecha, eh?  How interesting *yawn*.""  I was expecting cliche city, here!  I'm so glad that I was wrong.  Escaflowne is defined by the unexpected.  It's set up so perfectly, too. The show lays out a background, lets you get comfortable with the characters as they are.  Then, slowly but surely, a different, opposing idea is introduced.  You think you know who a person is, then subtle signs begin to appear that that person is something else alltoghether.  Then the shocker comes.  The great thing is that you really are shocked, even though there's been some foreshadowing.  It's because the writers don't feel the need to explain everything in detail before it happens (like some anime that I could mention. . ) so that the only people surprised are the characters in the show.  Instead, they just give you droplets of clues to go on.
The best part of this series is definately the depth of the characters.  From the moment I watched it, I was drawn in into thier concerns and hopes.  Hitomi is an especially nice character to find in anime.  Anime girls tend to follow two extremes - Damsel in Distress or Martial arts mommma.  Hitomi is neither of these.  She's athletic, but not Lady Sumo.  She talented, but not in an exaggerated way.  She is sometimes in trouble, but she saves Van and the others at least as often as she needs saving (if not more).
To sum up:  I guarantee that you will like this anime.  There are some minor points that keep it from being the best I've ever seen, but those are far overshadowed by how magnificent it is as a whole.  Buy it now! ;)",971481600,4,1647,4.496621621621622
1222313,5,B00000IBPA,Tenkuu no Escaflowne is one of my new favorites and ranks up there with Shinseiki Evangelion.  Mecha action with a great storyline and plot.  A must see for any Otaku of Mecha and/or fantasy Anime.  Kitto.,963100800,2,205,4.638888888888889
1222314,5,B00000IBPA,"Wow.
It's been awhile since I've seen a good, epic fantasy anime, and was actually miffed that anime like Record of Lodoss War were small in number. However, after watching The Vision of Escaflowne, a new standard  has been set.
As of writing this, this epic series is my all-time  favorite anime. Everything about it, from the down-to-earth characters, the  exciting action, to the extensive storyline, Escaflowne does it *right*.  Nothing feels contrived, nothing is out-of-place, nothing goes wrong. And  it's been awhile since I've seen an anime like this.
The storyline, while  not the best I've seen, is still a good piece of fantasy fiction. There's a  good balance between plot and action, with some episodes focusing on  developing the characters, and others simply depicting epic battles. A lot  of mystery regarding Gaea and Zaibach is developed early on, and there are  quite a few plot elements which don't get fully resolved until the end.  This certainly helped in holding my interest throughout the entire series.  And I must say, the ending was one of the better and more fulfilling  endings I've seen in an anime.
  Van, and the adorable Merle  While the  story is good, the characters really make this series come alive. Hitomi,  the central character, is so incredibly unlike anyone else in the series,  that she truly feels like she was plucked from Earth and placed in the  magical world of Gaea. Van, the young king of Fanelia, is driven by anger  and revenge, and he is truly fearsome as the pilot of Escaflowne. Allen is  a more typical medieval fantasy character, fulfilling the role of the  gallant knight. Merle is the utterly adorable cat-girl, who provides the  comic relief. If I had a list of cutest anime characters, she'd easily make  the top five. The villains are truly excellent as well. Dilandau and Folken  are the two main adversaries, and both are as different as night and day.  Dilandau is a bloodthirsty psycho with a hidden past, while Folken is quite  somber, cold and calculating. Of course, there are many other characters as  well, and all are fully developed and believable.
  Dilandau, the  sadistic psychopath (isn't he just so cool?)  And you if you happen to  think things like plot and character development are secondary to  white-knuckle action, don't worry. Escaflowne has plenty of exciting,  adrenaline-filled battles to satisfy you. The action combines standard  medieval warfare, giant mecha duels, and even a few aerial ballets. The  battle choreography is quite good, and the attention to mechanical details  on the mecha made them seem almost real.
Even though this is a TV series,  it has some very impressive production qualities. The artwork is superb,  the animation top-notch, and some nifty computer effects are seamlessly  blended in. Even better than the visuals is the wonderful music. I can  honestly say that Escaflowne has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in  an anime, ranging from light J-pop to thundering orchestral battle  themes.
Unless you have a complete aversion for fantasy, then you've no  reason not to check out this incredible series. The Vision of Escaflowne is  currently the best fantasy anime available, and should not be missed.",959558400,7,3230,5.007547169811321
1222315,4,B00000IBPA,"Kanzaki Hitomi, the heroine of the story, has one special ability - and that is to be able to take glimpses of the future. This, so-called the ""vision"" that she possessed, is what leads her into the alien  planet called Gaea. On a certain school day, the track team captain agrees  to give Hitomi a kiss should she run 100 metres in 13 seconds. She, thus,  starts running. As she approaches the finishing line, she sees the  ""vision"" again, this time, a young man in battle with a dragon.  The vision soon materialises and the dimensional gap, or a sort of a  wormhole that supposedly connects two different dimensions through  hyperspace, opens up for a brief period. This young man, called Van Fanel,  slays the dragon, and whilst returning to his own world, takes Hitomi by  accident. Hitomi finds herself in a totally different world, where earth  and the moon appear together in the night sky. It is known later that Van  Fanel was destined to be the king of Fanelia, but all of a sudden, the  foreign force called the ""Zaibach"", attacks. In this story,  Hitomi's vision and the pendant given to her by her grandmother play the  key role, and also, this is what the entire plot centres around. Will they  be able to defend Fanelia from the Zaibach aggression? Or will Hitomi even  survive to return to her home?
This Anime strongly reminds me of a  certain manga I've read. Actually the main theme is a very ordinary one.  I've seen similar plots in ""Saurus Knight"" drawn by Aki Katsu and  numerous other manga artists. (though the way they develop differs  slightly.) In this respect, this Anime has no originality and it is not  worth seeing. But... In spite of its cliched setting, it has superb  graphics and animation to boast of, and the mechas designed by Kimitoshi  are surely a sight. Although this Anime is not totally innovative in its  structure (as Evangelion, for example, is), Kawamori's knowhow gained  through years of animating the Macross series, is certainly reflected. The  other thing I liked about it was its unique character design. Also it  blends elements of science and fantasy very well. This would serve as a  nice Anime for all those science-fantasy fans.",958780800,,2190,4.737400530503979
1222316,5,B00000IBPA,"The Vision of Escaflowne is required viewing for anyone who calls him/herself an anime fan (or otaku, if you will).  There's something for everyone in this wonderful series: great story, romance, mecha action, epic  battles, three-dimensional characters, you name it.  For a TV series, the  quality of animation is excellent, surpassing that of most OVAs.  It's also  very refreshing to see a main character like Hitomi who's so endearing and  such an unlikely heroine.  What I found most remarkable was the music.  Yoko Kanno's sweeping score makes this already fantastic story burst with  energy.  But don't take my word for it.  See for yourself.",957398400,2,649,5.134615384615385

Escaflowne is also blessed with a  magnificent musical score; music that matches the storyline and animation  perfectly .. this series is by far my absolute favorite of any anime and i  *HIGHLY* recommend it to anyone! my only complaint is that i wish there  were more episodes .. fortunately, they're making an Escaflowne movie!  hooray :>",956188800,,739,5.0

1222329,5,B00000IBPA,"in the vision of escaflowne, hitomi is an ordinary high school student living in present day japan.  her passion is running track; she has a secret crush on an older classmate; she has a best friend whom she confides  in; and she reads tarot cards to tell fortunes to friends for fun.  one day  while running track, hitomi sees a distant scene in another world and  collapses. later, she is pulled into that dream world, a  world of kings,  dragons, magic, science, war, and angels, and a world where although she  seems powerless, soon comes to revolve around her and her actions.  if i  were to recommend one anime to a friend who has time (the story stretches  thirteen hours), i would recommend escaflowne. this is an animation for  guys and girls (tho' not for children).  there is no gratuituous fan  service, the story is gripping, and the animation is excellent (except for  one part where the  computer-generated animation didn't seem to quite fit  in with the rest of the animation).  my only complaints are that there are  a couple of plot  points that require a suspension of disbelief  that just  goes too far.  one is where there is a  real-life historical figure that is  involved  intimately in this new world, and the other  involves how a  legendary city is mixed up into  this.  i wish that the writers had just  left this part out, and used fantasy characters and places instead of  trying to tie this in with the 'real' world.  overall, tho', these are  minor points, and for 99% of the series, i was glued to the television set  at late hours of the night trying to finish it as i just could not put it  down.  :)",949104000,6,1635,4.5137931034482754

The mecha  battles are very well done as we see not only the outside but the insides  of these war machinces enhancing the realism of these giant robots.
