2205587,5,B0007939YI,"""Angel"" in the title should suggest to viewers that this really is a spiritual movie.  Although at the time they didn't really realize it, after Tom returned to the present those still in the past concluded that he must have been an angel sent to help May out of her trauma from the London bombings.  Viewers might want to keep this in mind when they discover what actually happened to May's life.

May had suffered so much pain.  Although it is not explicitly stated, might not God have sent an ""angel"" in the form of Tom to help her because He had other plans for May's life?  If not, why would it be that at some point in the movie we find May in church, kneeling in prayer?  Had her experience with Tom touched her spirituallly?

What about Tom?  After his visit with the vicar, the priest commends Tom for his genuine concern for the unfortunate and elderly.  After his experience in another realm, was it just human concern - or was his concern the outgrowth of a spiritual familiarity that others haven't had?  Is it just childishness or a spiritual motivation that would compel Tom to forget what the kids think, and even try to go against his mother,  just to help those he realized were in need?

I think Tom learns another lesson as well - that sometimes when people refuse the help we think they need things don't necessarily turn out as one fears.  In keeping with the spiritual undertones in this film, Tom learns that sometimes it is best to leave other people's life in God's hands - that no matter how well-meaning we are, He loves people and cares for them in His own way.

Nobody would say this is an angel movie, or a church movie.  It is an entertaining, compelling and wholesome movie that must speak to human's natural spiritual inclinations.  Hence, everyone I've shown it to comes away feeling good . . . As if ""touched by an angel"" themselves!",1133568000,7,1869,4.485207100591716

He and young May then go to visit Alison in the hospital. Alison is the daughter of the farm couple whom the orphaned May was staying with. Alison`s parents have been killed by a German bomb and Tom has seen her grave in the future and knows she will not survive either. So he gives her a whiff of his asthma inhaler and we are then led to believe that this saves Alison`s life and Alison is then able to care for May saving her from future bag ladyness. But wait a minute... the inhaler had been broken earlier in the film when the boys in the past grab it from Tom breaking it. So how was it able to revive Alison ?,1363564800,,751,4.046979865771812

Quietly plotted, made-for-TV British film where Tom, about 12, discovers a time warp in some old ruins near Hadrian's Wall in South Yorkshire. He finds himself back in 1941, where he develops a close, exquisite friendship with May, a girl about his age who, narrowly escaping death herself, was orphaned during a German air raid.

2205616,4,B0007939YI,"This is one of the best family movies ever made.  So, why is it going out of print so soon?

The story is superior.  No problems there.  The photography, the music, the actors--all good.

But the character of the mother and even of Tom?  Why did the writer choose to make the mother such a horror?  This was not necessary to the story, still less to the plot.  If anything, it makes it slightly incredible that Tom would have such a desperate longing to leave the caring life of the farm to return to the irascible mother.  And what it does to the tone of the movie as a whole is incalculable.  It also straining credibility why any man would want to marry her.

The character of Tom also is problematic.  True, he was unhappy that his mother is about to marry again.  But his behavior in the beginning is so obnoxious as to raise credibility problems.  More seriously, it makes for an unappealing main character--a disaster for any novel or movie.

There is no excuse for the writer to have made these choices and it is even difficult to think of an explanation of what caused the author to do it.  Was the writer striving for realism?  But, this is a fantasy--time travel, etc.  Realism has already been thrown away.

Whatever the cause, this is why the movie is already heading off the market after such a short stay.  It would be nice if screenwriters and moviemakers would learn from the fate of this movie.",1149984000,4,1412,4.44140625
2205617,5,B0007939YI,"Feature films are for children, or at least for the child in each viewer, so it always refreshing to stumble across films like ""An Angel for May"" and ""Restless Spirits"".  Contrary to popular belief,  films do not have to be dumbed down for children.  Much of the pleasure they get comes from puzzling out complex plot developments and recognizing subtle details.  Both these films have a hidden depth to their story and storytelling technique that will interest even the most sophisticated viewer-provided that they retain at least some of their childhood capacity for wonder.

""An Angel for May"" is a nice adaptation of Melvin Burgess' critically acclaimed novel of the same title.  The themes are the need to find a purpose or direction outside yourself and the recognition of inter-generational ties that exist because we all share the experience of having once been young. The intriguing title is actually a reference to the almost heaven-sent appearance of a 12-year old boy in the midst of WWII Yorkshire, England.

But things are a bit more complicated because 12- year old Tom (Matthew Beard) is from ""present day"" Yorkshire. Things are not going so great for him there. He is the self-absorbed only child of separated parents, seemingly with no friends, asthmatic, and upset that his mother plans to remarry. One day he follows a stray dog to an abandoned farm in the hills outside town and suddenly finds himself transported to that same spot in 1941.

It was a working farm back then, run by Sam Wheeler (Tom Wilkinson).  Sam and his daughter Alison are taking care of 10- year old May (Charlotte Wakefield), an orphaned evacuee whose whole block (terrace) was destroyed in a German bombing raid. The story is told from the point of view of the totally disoriented Tom who runs into town after his arrival and manages to get himself into a lot of trouble. The seemingly confident and resourceful May comes to his rescue.

May has picked up on Tom's dislocation and distress, sensing in him a kindred spirit who needs her help coping with the horrors of wartime Britain. This is where POV in the film becomes important. May is a huge dichotomy,  once a spunky and charming girl, her wartime experiences have turned her into a traumatized victim.  POV means that viewers must learn about her at the same slow pace it is revealed to Tom. The first revelation occurs as the two make their way back to the farm. When German planes jettison bombs (from an aborted raid on Sheffield) in the fields, May freezes in an exposed position until Tom pulls her to the ground. Later we learn that she has a phobia about being indoors, the result of being trapped for days in the rubble of her Yorkshire home. She takes her meals outside and sleeps in a shed.

But May is protective of Tom who seems to her even more lost. The need to appear strong for him motivates May to overcome her own fears. When Tom discovers a way to return home he elects to do so, believing that Sam will give May a good home.

Back in his own time, Tom's account of his adventures is not believed and he learns that the farm was destroyed by bombs just a few days after he left. The remainder of the film centers on his efforts to return so that he can finish helping May.

The acting for the camera directing is excellent, especially with the two child actors. ""An Angel for May"" offers an excellent example of the power a filmmaker can discover in the framing of his shots. Director Harley Cokeliss emphasizes the face and eyes of his young actors with multiple close-ups and reaction shots, which bonds the audience to them. This technique can reveal acting deficiencies but Cokeliss gets exactly what he needs from his two inexperienced stars; and the more experienced supporting cast is universally excellent.

Wakefield's role is the most challenging.  She must sell not just her character's obvious terror, but also a multi-dimensionality that makes you understand why Sam and Alison see qualities inside her that make it so important to them that she be brought back from the brink.

Especially gratifying is the avoidance of many potential missteps in the climatic scenes. There is a nice and relatively unexpected twist without any overwrought melodrama.  If you've allowed yourself to take this journey with Tom,  you will be rewarded at the end with one of those extraordinary emotional experiences for which we watch films.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1140566400,65,4456,4.753566796368353
2205618,4,B0007939YI,"In AN ANGEL FOR MAY director Harley Cokeliss has assembled a fine cast and production team to bring this 'children's classic' novel by Melvin Burgess to the screen (screenplay by Peter Milligan), and in doing so he has quite successfully transferred a very tender little tale into a full blown motion picture that still maintains the gentle message of Burgess' book.

Tom (Tam in the book - played by Matthew Beard) is a disillusioned young lad, living in a broken home in Yorkshire England, and in need of finding meaning to his brittle life.  He happens upon a relic of a structure where he encounters a dog and a 'bag lady', and also the entry port to a trip to the past!

Time traveling to WW II he lands in London during the blitz attacks, befriends a young girl named May (Charlotte Wakefield) and then time travels back to the present where he encounters disbelief in his adventure.  He feels he must return to the past to save May from an impending doom and in his attempts in doing so he comes to learn much about life, death, devotion, promises, and the effects of the passage of time.

The actors are exceptional, both Beard and Wakefield as children but also Tom Wilkinson and Anna Massey in roles as adults whose participation in Tom's plight are deeply touching.  The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the pacing of the direction is excellent.  Stories such as this require a certain amount of fantasy participation in order to be effective, and this is where Cokeliss shines.  He does not allow the sentiment to become cloying and he maintains enough reality checks between the adults and the children to make us believe in angels a bit.  It is a sweet film, very well made, and worth the viewer's time with its important message.  Grady Harp, February 06",1139875200,21,1783,4.685897435897436

8046042,5,B0007939YI,"I just saw it An Angel for May, and think of it as a YA (young adult) Outlander.

Significantly - or not - the Melvin Burgess novel on which the 2002 movie was based was published in 1992, or just a year after Diana Gabaldon published her first Outlander novel.  I have no idea if Burgess read and was inspired by Outlander, but the two stories have a lot common.  Time travel in An Angel for May happens when the hero, young Tom, walks through a broken stone facade of an old building.  Both stories have a foot in the Second World War - the point of departure for Claire in Outlander, the terminus for Tom.  Both are UK-based.  And both are, in significant part, about the time traveler trying to change history.

But there are differences.  A dog plays a role in An Angel for May, which is a lot less tempestuous than Outlander.  There's a gentleness running through the story.  Kids are the protagonists.

Time travel, in general, can try to re-set history in two ways.  The big way attempts something like killing Hitler or saving Socrates (see, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plot-to-Save-Socrates-Sierra-Waters-Book-1/dp/B00AMUDJNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plot to Save Socrates (Sierra Waters Book 1)</a>).  The little ways are more personal, as in saving a particular person who never walked on the historical stage.  Outlander has some of both.  An Angel for May has just the latter.

Indeed, though Tom wants to save lives, what he's most focused on is improving the life of the girl he meets in the World War II past.  What he's striving to do for May - who is a friend, not a girlfriend - is really a very little thing, with big consequences for her.  It's refreshing and altogether excellent to encounter a time travel story on this scale, and I recommend it.",1516492800,,1840,4.938110749185668
