8434526,2,B004LOHT9G,"Vertigo, 1958 film

The film begins with a womans face - her eyes look bloodshot. Then the credits roll. There is a chase on the rooftops. One man slips and falls to his death. The other survives with a foot injury. [Does he look out his Rear Window?] Acrophobic? Can a cantilevered brassiere be revolutionary? John Ferguson is available, like other Frisco bachelors. Is his problem curable? [Is there subtle humor here?] San Francisco is changing since the war. [Shipping was moving across the bay.] John is hired to follow another mans wife; there is fear from the dead. Reluctantly, Scotty accepts for an old friend. Scottys Dodge follows the Jaguar. [The cars date the picture.] Isnt he following too closely?

The Mission Dolores is an old historical church. Carlotta Valdes 1831-1857. Next the Museum. Whose picture is on the wall? Then the McKittrick Hotel. It does seem silly. Did she drop her tail? Scotty will consult a local expert at a book shop, and learns Frisco history. Poor thing. Madeleine has jewelry owned by Carlotta Valdes, her great-grandmother. [Would a suicide be buried in a church cemetery?] Next to the Presidio, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Will Madeleine jump into the cold water? What next? Will Goldilocks sleep in Papa Bears bed? What happened? [Note the coffee percolator.] Madeleine leaves, Scotty follows. [Does this film move slowly?] They go for a ride in the country and look at an old redwood tree. There is talk about not knowing the recent past. How do you know? Doe the conversations make sense?

Scottys old girlfriend Midge is skilled at painting. But Johnny is not impressed. [What does that tell you?] Next they travel to a historic mission church. Theres an answer for everything. [But is it the correct answer?] They climb the stairs to the bell tower. Something falls past the window. There is a coroners inquest: suicide from an unsound mind. [But now I got a hint to the ending.] You and I both know who killed Madeleine. Scotty has dreams or nightmares. Does Mozarts music have healing qualities? Is Johnny sedated? After his release he revisits their former places. Does he recognize a woman on the street? Johnny follows her to a hotel. Judy Barton tells her story. Shes not in Kansas anymore and has a drivers license to prove it. There is a flashback to what happened at that bell tower? Judy writes a letter and tells the truth. But she decides to stay and dine with Scotty. They visit the Exposition during the day. Scotty is controlling, he wants Judy to dress like Madeleine. Why is he doing this? [Does he have a clue?] Then he notices Judy is wearing that same necklace? Will Scotty break free of the past? What will Judy say or do? [Is there a pattern of deaths in the presence of Scotty?]

This story runs on too long, its story is too sleight and implausible. Why would Judy from Kansas agree to a murder plot with a stranger? In the early 20th century French criminologists used the method of recreating the crime to test eyewitness testimony. Could a man and a woman hide on top of that bell tower without being seen by the police and others? This explanation of the murder is false.

The Foreign Censorship Ending is much better than the short ending since it wraps up the loose ends. Any investigation into Madeleines recent past would have revealed the plot. The spouse or boyfriend is always the prime suspect in an unusual death; a person who profits from the death doubly so. Once youve seen this you will understand the rationale for the 1984 film Body Double, a better film which echoes the ideas from this film. Contrast this plodding film to North by Northwest.",1413936000,,3642,4.720125786163522
8434527,5,B004LOHT9G,"This is the restored version of VERTIGO. It is widscreen and is sort of what many of us were unable to grow up with just being able to watch VERTIGO on television for so many years. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a statement that we as moviegoers are voyeurs and are just as fanatically obsessed by the images on the screen as ""Scottie"" Ferguson is with Madeleine in VERTIGO. VERTIGO is in effect a movie about people who love the cinema and are captivated by it. Those people who do not like VERTIGO state that it is not realistic and too improbable. That is just the point. VERTIGO is about an artificial world and the fascination of that world. Those who like VERTIGO are drawn to it over and over because it is about something that is inside each of us that is ever so fleeting and will always remain unobtainable. Bernard Herrmann, the film's composer seems to have understood the essence of this film as he captured the erotic passion and ultimate hopelessness of its characters with his haunting score. Herrmann had always expressed his desire to be a symphony conductor, yet the lure of the cinema was more than just a means of collecting a paycheck for him. I think he had a great understanding of the cinema and its power over human emotions, yet it seems to have remained an enigma even for him.

I always thought that the casting of the four principal characters in VERTIGO was so effective. James Stewart as ""Scottie"" Ferguson, Kim Novak as ""Madeleine"" Judy Barton, Barbara Bel Geddes as Midge Wood and Tom Helmore as Gavin Elster all give pivotal performances as people wanting more of whatever drives them to fulfill their lives. The viewer's loyalties and hopes are swayed by who these characters slowly reveal themselves to be. VERTIGO is a world of illusions and obsessions. James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes are all part of the experience of VERTIGO as is Robert Burks' cinematography and Saul Bass' indelible main titles. I like the transfere, but the restoration of the audio, which liberties were taken with re-doing many of the foley effects and the score, is a bit disappointing and almost sacrilegious. Since we still have the original to return to, I do not mind this so much these days.",1388880000,,2236,4.675126903553299
