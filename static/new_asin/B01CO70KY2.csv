8753535,5,B01CO70KY2,Excellent as always.  I only have one complaint and it is more doctrine-based than the story or the acting. I am sure that Don Matteo is giving hope to the person who just murdered someone and said they lost their mind and that is why they did it. It seems like he is saying the person will still be ok eventually.,1520380800,,314,4.147540983606557

8753541,5,B01CO70KY2,"great entrtainment!...can't tell you how manyt imes we have watched the whole series and waiting anxiously for the next sets to come out - great drama; great teachings; great for people of all faiths but most especially Catholics and Ortodox Christians because of the many Bible verses and the Holy Mass, Confession etc....
every single night after dinner and sfter shower when they are ready to go to bed, they say their prayers and then beg for one more episode of Don Matteo, and since we love it too, we can't refuse and therefore, every night we watch Don MAtteo again and again - it is highly entertaining and it is good for families, especially families with different struggles and problems - try it, you won't regret it....
oh we just can't wait for #16, #17 etc......please get them out real soon....thanks",1462665600,,816,4.753521126760563
8753542,5,B01CO70KY2,"Don Matteo is a great serial. It's very sad, that we cannot see it in german language because in Germany and Austria are the most Terence Hill-Fans. But it's very interesting to see it in italian language with english subtitles. My english is also not perfect, but better than ""mia italiano"", the people speak to fast and so the english subtitles are very helpful. The first 3 seasons (set1-5) were not so interesting but from season 4+5 (sets 6-10) it get's a really story (capitano Anchesci + Major Laura), season 6 the new capitano and seasons 7+8 (sets 12-15) the story about capitano Tommasi and Patrizia. It's also more action than in the first 3 seasons. The size of the picture is from season 7 on better (16:9-full-picture) than the first 6 sets (4:3). The stories in set 13 are very good.
P.S.: Sorry for my (bad) english.",1462233600,2,832,4.628378378378378
