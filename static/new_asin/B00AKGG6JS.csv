 I did want to point out to everyone that the movie is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, otherwise known as 4:3 FULLSCREEN not 16:9 Widescreen - even tho this movie is from 2005 and when I caught it on ABCFamily (of course it was the last showing and I missed the 1st 37 mins) is was 16:9 (the menus are even in 16:9, just not the movie).  Personally I buy Bluray whenever I can but had to settle for DVD when I couldn't find the bluray or it online digitally from Netflix, Amazon, Dish or from Redbox, so it's been a while since I bought a DVD and forgot you need to actually look for widescreen edition.

5445475,5,B00AKGG6JS,"Mark Ruffalo & Reece Witherspoon are great in this cute comedy. Casting in this movie was spot ON. Reece plays a workaholic doctor, who never quite gets around to having a romantic relationship (so she is set up on a blind date by family members... Mark Ruffalo  is set up to meet Reece by his friend & psychologist ...however, they never get to meet, because he backs out, and while in route ...she is in a car accident & ends up in a coma.  The story line has humor and a few serious moments, without being unbelievable.

I particularly like the subtle details. The neighbor who hits on David and tries too hard to get his attention. The character that Reece plays that is too busy with work, to have a personal life. The laid back, sports watching, beer drinking character that David portrays... The bookstore/psychic guy and his personality is great. I love his  response when asked, ""do you believe in this stuff (about ghosts)...?"" He responds with ""well, you don't, UNTIL you do."". (it's not just WHAT he says, it's the way he says it).

I also particularly love the RESTAURANT scene when Reece realizes she was a doctor ...

Love the hospital scenes near the end.

Love the driving the van scenes, ...seeing the blooper reel of these snip it moments really prove just how talented Ruffalo's acting is.

Love the scene when David tries to talk to Abby about prolonging Elizabeth's life...the whole skit is funny ...but also thoughtful, when Abby's daughter can actually see Elizabeth too.

Love the conversation between E & D when her time is almost over, and she says the last few hours, is time she wants to SPEND WITH HIM!... He says, Okay, what do you want to do? Travel to Paris? See the Eiffel Towel? Dance on the beach?.... we'll do it...ANYTHING, just NAME it! ,...as long as they take mastercard & visa... (is that not the sweetest thing a partner could say?) Well, at least I thought it was.

I also have seen MANY Mark Ruffalo movies and interviews before, but this movie is the only one that really makes me SEE him, for who he is... Personally, I think his personality comes through, with his character role... and I think he's a great guy, (as an actor and as a real person. It may sound simple, but how many other actors seem to portray someone all the time, that coincides with a bit of who they really are in person? I can't think of more than 7 if even that...).

I like this movie, I bought it (twice), and the 2nd one was because the first one I got has a small scratch on it, that causes problems in 3 spots while watching on a computer... (not dvd player)... So I bought a 2nd copy...and yet, that one, from Amazon has a large slash from what looks like a box cutter... Amazon says it's not their fault, so looks like I'm going to have to buy a 3rd copy. Not enough to keep me from buying it again though! Love this movie ... love it enough to buy it for a 3rd time! :).",1396742400,2,2899,4.389925373134329
