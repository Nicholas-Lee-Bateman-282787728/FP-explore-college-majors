378359,4,6301929195,"To be able to watch and enjoy Traxx, you have to realize that you can't take the movie seriously.  Actually, this isn't all that difficult to do because the movie itself doesn't take itself all that seriously.  It looks like everyone involved in this production had a good time just having fun with the premise, and running with it.  The premise itself is simple, ex-mercenary Traxx, the hero, wants to make cookies to compete with Famous Amos, but he's not a good cook, and soon runs out of money.  To make money, he decides to become a town tamer, and restore law and order to a town which is heavily overrun by the criminal element, and charge the city $10,000 for his services
From there, the movie really takes off, leading to several hilarious encounters with the bad guys, as Traxx single handedly picks them off.  During most of the fights Traxx stands center stage, hardly ever moving, but nobody seems able to hit him during the gun fights, which becomes one of the running gags of the movie since he has never been shot, which he tells to his extremely reluctant sidekick, whom he has recruited, whether he wants the job or not.
Traxx's choice of fillings for his cookies are some of the funniest moments of the movies, who could seriously think anyone would enjoy eating either cough drop and laxative cookies, crab cookies, or chili cookies?  Traxx is the only person on the planet who could have come up with these combinations.  This running gag itself is one of the funniest in the movie.
The movie winds to a close as three brothers, the Guzik brothers, are called in to deal with Traxx.  They kidnap the police little league team for hostages, and give Traxx an hour to show up at a bar to have a stand off with them.  One of the funniest moments of the movie occurs in the bar during the midst of a gun fight when all four of them suspend their gunplay to listen to a woman talking on the television.  That scene itself was hilarious, as well as the conclusion to the movie itself.  I highly recommend you find a way to see this movie, even if it means renting it.  If you like your action flavored with some off the wall comedy then this is the movie for you.",978652800,4,2179,4.4335839598997495
378360,5,6301929195,"i don't think they've release this on DVD. Good thing i bought this on VHS oh so many years ago
This movie is silly. It's about a mercenary  killer/soldier of fortune who wants to give up killing to bake cookies. The  problem is, he can't cook. So to earn money until he makes it big in the  cookie business, he goes to a big city with a crime problem and offers to  clean up their streets in exchange for cash. Traxx, the main character, is  stupid, a bad cook and kind of dense, but for some strange reason he can't  be shot (all the bad guys are terrible aims; his inability to be hit by a  bullet when he engages in numerous full scale gun fights is a running joke  in the movie)
In the end, the local crime lord calls in three psychopaths  to kill Traxx. These people are so mean, they threaten to kill the crime  lord's accountant unless he sings Old McDonald with them. They pick the  animal, he has to make the sound. They pick a gazelle, which confuses the  poor guy and nearly gets him killed (turns out, ""it's a trick  question; gazelle's ain't got no voice box"")
And then they kidnap  the little league baseball team and Traxx has to go rescue them. Like i  said, this is a silly movie. Not slapstick like the Zucker brothers and  Airplane, but it doesn't pretend to realistic. And while the whole movie  sounds really, really bad, this movie really is incredibly funny,  especially if you're watching it with a bunch of friends who enjoy poking  fun at movies that intentionally try to be bad. This movie is a classic,  and i wish more people had seen it",966729600,7,1567,4.319587628865979

7816787,2,6301929195,"I went into Traxx hoping for a ""so silly it's great"" action comedy film (I mean, it's a cop who bakes cookies- what's not to like?), and while the film had its moments, they were too few and far between.  It's very hit and miss.  I think part of the problem is that the ""renegade cop"" angle was done before this, and better, in Sledge Hammer, and the wackiness was executed much better in The Naked Gun and Police Squad.  There were quite a few gags in here that could've been much funnier if they had been fine-tuned.  I also didn't care for the look of the film, which looked dirty and cheap.  The soundtrack is also very dated; you can tell it came from the '80s.

It wasn't a total waste of time but I wasn't laughing as much as I hoped I would.",1403913600,,749,4.13103448275862
7816788,5,6301929195,"I watched this movie when it first came out.  We laughed all the way through it, and did so again when we got this one.",1393027200,,119,3.76
7816789,5,6301929195,"Traxx is one of those films that is so goofy and self aware that you can't help but enjoy it.  It's cheesy and over-the-top, but if that's what you like, give it a shot.  There are just so many scenes that are incredible, I can't summarize them here.",1358899200,3,250,4.1875
7816790,4,6301929195,"After watching a best of complilation from Traxx, I immediately purchased the VHS.  I expected that I had just watched all of the funny scenes, but I wanted to see the complete story to see how all of the scenes were tied together.  After finding a VCR to borrow, my friends and I gathered for a night of bad 80's movie viewing.
My low expectations for Traxx were far surpassed.  Traxx was in many ways a very bad movie, but it was ""so bad, it was good"" in many ways.  The plot and over-the-top acting made the movie hilarious.  The movie is 84 minutes long and we laughed almost continuously throughout.  Even the music during the closing credits is funny and entertaining.
Shadoe Stevens delivers a brilliant acting performance, in that he manages to somehow keep his composure while delivering some awful lines of dialog.  In several scenes, Stevens has a huge grin on his face prior to, and even during, some of his lines.  You can tell that it really was a struggle to not burst out laughing.
Overall, I would recommend Traxx to anyone looking for a really fun movie to watch.  If you plan a ""bad movie"" night, Traxx should be at the top of your list.  You may only watch this movie once, but you will remember it for a long time.",1354406400,2,1235,4.424778761061947
7816791,5,6301929195,"Traxx a very funny, quick paced movie.  The tongue in cheek on OO7, and Rambo. and Die Hard films is one reason I still have
a VHS player.  It would be fantastic if this did come out on DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Ice-The-Numa-Files/dp/042519602X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Ice (The Numa Files)</a>",1316649600,2,354,6.673913043478261
7816792,5,6301929195,"Like the other reviewers of this movie, it tops the chart for being one of the most ludicrous and ridiculous movies to ever come down the cinematic pike.  However, I must confess that when my buddies and me first sat down to watch it way back when, we could not stop laughing from beginning to end.  Shadoe Stevens is perfectly cast as this cool-as-a-cucumber mercenary who comes into a lawless hell-hole of a town for the sole purpose of 'cleaning it up'; hence telling the bad guys to, ""get out of town"".  We have not eyeballed this flick since the late 80's, so it's going to be a blast to relive the guffaws, chuckles and belly-laughs.  Hmmnn... even if your tastes run a little on the higher-end of the comedy spectrum, this lunatic offering just might have *you* 'guffawing'...",1290816000,,783,4.611510791366906
7816793,4,6301929195,"The collective group of friends who watched this movie with me agreed with the positive ratings of the other reviewers, but there certainly are funnier parts of the movie than they claimed.  It's definitely the subtler humor that's more amusing, such as the end of the idiotic love scene in the library or the great opening scene at the pet shop.
This movie is best enjoyed by persons who have also watched and enjoyed such classics as UHF, Army of Darkness, Mr. T's Be Somebody or Be Somebody's Fool, etc., or in other words, by people who enjoy completely ludicrous humor.  There's definitely some dull spots to sit through (hence 4 stars) but definitely worth it.",1059177600,4,666,4.732758620689655
