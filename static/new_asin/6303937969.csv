7856297,5,6303937969,"The reviewer who criticized Ally Sheedy's performance in this movie upset me to the point where I decided to write my own review. I am an experienced viewer of her films, and I've never seen anything less than the best from her. She is at her best in this movie as well. She plays an art director, Mickey, who has a successful career, but she is struggling with the death of her mother (incidentially, Ally's own mother, Charlotte, plays her mother), and seems to be missing something from her personal life. Enter Jack (A Martinez). He sits in the background staring at her while she is with her friends who have gathered for a baby shower. After the friends leave he approaches her. Things progess to the point where they end up in bed together. The passion is so intense that neither person can forget the other. The problem is that Jack initially hides his secret from her, the murder of his wife. Mickey finds herself sandwiches between Jack and his in-laws. Jack's mother-in-law accuses him of murdering her daughter, while he proclaims his innocense. The true culprit is really the father-in-law (stepfather of the deceased). Frederic Forrest plays the stepfather, Michael. Few actors can portray a villian better than Mr. Forrest. If you've ever seen ""Right to Kill?"", then you know what I mean. Michael gets his just desserts in the end, and all ends happily for the couple. A Martinez gives a rather controlled performance, but I think that is due to the nature of his role, and not an indication of poor acting. As far as Ally Sheedy is concerned, anybody who is an experienced viewer of her movies can sense her real-life fear, and what exactly that fear is. What that fear is, and the fear itself, is apparent in this movie. And it is not an act. This creates in me a compassion for her, as it should other people. Ally, don't believe anybody who puts you down. They are just uninformed.",1107043200,3,1900,4.640949554896142

 How Miss Shire was able to get the casting of A. Martinez is sheer brilliance.  A. Martinez is such a gifted actor, so talented in every film I have seen him in.
  Ally Sheedy plays ""Mickey"".  She designs advertising campaigns.  She is trying to get over Michael, her ex-husband, who is getting married to someone else.  To cheer herself up, she meets the girls at a restaurant for a baby shower. ""Jack"" (played by A. Martinez) comes up to her after the girls have left.  She tries to resist his offer, but Jack is so tender and sweet.  This one night stand becomes a night of romantic and erotic love-making.  For Jack it is ""a possibility for love"".  The next morning, he is gone.  At first scared, she looks around the house and nothing is gone.  She realizes she can trust him.  Her money is still in her purse.  She fell hard for Jack.  She told him things that were so secret.  She continually has flashbacks of that memorable night.  She tries to find him without being too obsessive.  Soon he calls her one morning.  He wanted to see her again. The story isn't over yet.
  Interesting love story.  Nice to see a man portrayed as an honest, sensitive, caring individual...and a regular bed partner.
  Don Novello (NBC, Saturday Night Live, ""Father Guido Sarducci"") and Frederic Forest also in the film.  Roger Corman was one of the Executive Producers.
  Fans of A. Martinez in Santa Barbara (1984-93), L.A. Law (1986-94), General Hospital & Port Charles, One Life to Live and currently The Bold and the Beautiful will not be disappointed.
  Wish it was available on DVD.",1092355200,4,2102,5.574603174603174
7856299,1,6303937969,"It's hard to imagine how anything this bad gets released. The plot, script and direction are below freshman level. When Sheedy isn't looking bored rolling around in bed she looks downright dowdy in a Kmart wardrobe. In fact  she looks terrible and sounds worse. Martinez has the false intensity of a  soap opera star. Each of the actors seems to be performing in a separate  movie. Only the extras do a professional job. Must have been made in 2 weeks  or less. An embarassment to good actors who seem embarassed to be in  it. Deserves negative stars.",950659200,2,551,4.639175257731959
7856300,5,6303937969,"This was a picture I happened upon by accident late one night when I was restless.  Needless to say that even though I did not see the beganing of the movie what I did see made me yurn to see it again a few more times.  All of the actors did a wonderful job. The plot was there, the suspence was  there, and the LOVE was there. Talia Shire did a surpurb job.  Thank you  for the love, we all need it.",918000000,2,400,3.8292682926829267
