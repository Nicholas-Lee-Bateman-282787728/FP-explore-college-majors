A brilliant performance. I look forward to reliving the experience through this DVD. I have attached a few images that I shot of his brilliant performance.

Enjoyed the section about the actor, himself as his passions are equal to Muir.  Made my ""stay vacation"" or arm chair traveler experience so much more enjoyable than just books (though good, also).",1422489600,,330,4.754385964912281
8416402,5,B004500SNK,"I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Stetson portray John Muir at the theatre in Yosemite Valley, and he is so captivating, that you would think you were actually looking and listening to John Muir himself.  In fact, I completely forgot that I was watching an actor.  He has an incredibly natural performing style, and he never flubbed a single word, (and there was a huge amount of dialogue).  His mannerisms and accent were incredibly realistic, and his performance really brings the spirit of John Muir alive.  Being quite a fan of Mr. Muir, I had always wondered what it would be like to sit and chat with the man.  I no longer have to wonder, thanks to Mr. Stetson.

On to the video itself -
In the first half of this video, you are treated to the story of how Mr. Stetson came to play the infamous John Muir, and his respect for the man and all he stood for is very evident in his unusual and fascinating past.  Liberally sprinkled in, are historical facts about John Muir and insights into the one of the most esteemed and significant historical individuals, generally credited as the original founder of the ecology movement, as well as one of the most important figures responsible for the National Parks.  The second half of the video, is an actual performance of ""Stickeen"" by Lee Stetson, based on the beloved book by John Muir.  Mr. Stetson truly makes the book come alive in vivid detail, and anyone who has read and admired John Muir will be completely captivated with the portrayal.",1409788800,5,1495,4.590225563909774
