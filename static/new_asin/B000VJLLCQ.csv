8219063,5,B000VJLLCQ,"This is my favorite movie by my favorite director, with some of my favorite actors - too bad there weren't parts for Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, but one can't have everything.  Another reviewer has laid out the basic plot,  but I think some of the psychological subtleties of the drama were not covered by that review.  Devlin (Cary Grant) doesn't avoid Alicia (ingrid Bergman)  merely because falling for her would be inconvenient - there is a lot more going on.  For starters,  in the nineteen forties, Alicia is a really ""bad girl""; she's notorious not only because her father was a traitor, but because she drinks too much, and the script makes it perfectly clear that she sleeps around.  Before she marries Sebastian, she tells Devlin that he can add Sebastian to her list of ""playmates"".  Alicia and Devlin fall hard for each other before they find out that the job involves Alicia making a play for Sebastian.  When they do, Devlin refuses to say anything to keep her from agreeing to it, even though it's clear she's longing for the least sign from him that he doesn't want her to do it.  He believes at that point that if she truly loves him she won't go through with it, while she believes if he truly loves her, he won't make her do it.  Ach! So she goes to serve her country with her body.  Sebastian (played by Claude Raines), doesn't become suspicious that she is an agent, but he is suspicious of Devlin - jealous of him.  He does eventually  find out about Alicia's spying and his solution to his little problem, aided by his mother (a woman who gives even Nazi mothers-in-law a bad name), is genuinely chilling.  The end of the movie is one of the best in the history of cinema.  This is one you'll want to watch again and again, and each time you will notice something different.  How did Hitchcock capture the running of the horse race in the binoculars held in front of Ingrid Bergman's eyes?  It's all part of the lovely mystery....",1218326400,4,1961,4.538461538461538
8219064,5,B000VJLLCQ,"Hitchcock framed this war time noir film around a debonair Cary Grant and the youthful beauty of Ingrid Bergman. Luxuriant black and white cinematography was added to this elegant love story set in the world of secret agents, giving it a lusciously romantic glow not found in his other films. The love story plays out against mounting suspense, making this one of his best films.

From sun-drenched Miami to exotic Brazil, this intertwined story of spies and romance is exciting to watch. American secret agent Delvin (Grant) is forced to use Alicia (Bergman) to get close to a suspected Nazi, Alexander Sebastion (Claude Rains). Alicia's father was convicted of being a German agent, and his playgirl daughter has been living fast and hard trying to forget ever since. Delvin reluctantly recruits her under orders from above and the vulnerable Alicia falls hard for him.

Her assignment must take top priority, so Delvin cannot let on that he too has fallen for her. Claude Rains does a good job as the deceptively dangerous Sebastion, in love with Alicia but growing more suspicious by the moment. His suspicions reach a fever pitch when her old friend Delvin arrives on the scene.

All Alicia wants is for Delvin to tell her not to get close to Sebastion. He can't, of course, and the romantic tension builds side by side with the suspense, creating an almost unbearable anxiety on two fronts.

The romance gets equal billing until Alicia and Delvin discover something in the wine cellar and Sebastion realizes she is a spy. Since Delvin has been reassigned to Spain, he may not be in time to save her. The famous staircase scene is just one highlight in a film filled with memorable images.

Hitchcock took an alluring Bergman, a handsome Grant, and a tightly written and suspenseful script, and made one of the most exciting and lusciously beautiful films in screen history. Ingrid Bergman is lovely and vulnerable and Cary Grant has his hands full keeping his feelings to himself so he can do his job. Don't miss this one. It is one of Hitchcock's best.",1210896000,6,2059,4.8215297450424925
