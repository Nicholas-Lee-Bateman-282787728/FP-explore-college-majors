The relationship between Beverly and the trill Odan twists and pulls Beverly's heart to the breaking point when she finds out that Odan is actually living in many bodies.  It also makes her blush recurringly red throughout most of the first half of the show.

The scene when Beverly's in the Ten Forward nursing a hot lemon herb tea and Deanna joins her to help her talk and cry over Odan is moving and rather amusing also; I laugh, yet really feel for poor Bev when Odan comes in and perceptive, sharp Beverly senses Odan's presence before she turns around.  Deanna has to wheedle a heartbroken, crying Beverly to turn to look and meet Odan's eyes.  Bev finally finds the courage to lift her downcast eyes up after a while and turn to look at Odan and the sad look on her face is very moving, esp. when Odan kind of lights up when he sees her.  Beverly gulps in an attempt to hold back a fresh wave of tears.

The ending is bittersweet and realistic; I liked how honest Beverly was with Odan and I love that Odan was understanding and that they admitted that they still loved each other.

The look on Beverly's face when the new host for Odan comes in is priceless; I laugh when Bev turns to the new host and realizes that Odan is actually a she and her large dark blue serious eyes just widen, she gasps a little, and her whole face is unforgettable!

Touching, lovely ending of Odan and Bev exchanging a last goodbye and Odan kissing Beverly's pudgy hand. I think Odan really loved that Beverly was honest in admitting that she was too sensitive and reserved to keep up with all the million body changes the trill go through; it shows Beverly's courageous, thoughtful, and lovely character all the way through.  And Odan was lovely and wonderful also.

Excellent episode, just about the best in season 4.",1235779200,,2070,4.502673796791444
7861417,5,6304075286,"Who was that Trill I saw you with last night?
In this one Bev Crusher falls for a Trill host.  They make their first appearance in this episode.  The host's body rejects the worm and Riker offers to serve as host to the worm entity.  Other than that it's not the most action filled episode.  But it does stretch the bounds of love for poor Bev.  She has this thing for Riker, however it's the personality in the Trill that she loves.  It's sets the tone for all the future Trills we see like Dax in Deep Space Nine.",1023321600,,515,4.151515151515151

But the good Doctor is crushed when she learns that her lover is actually a parasitic life form that lives off host bodies  and has lived for years.  The episode becomes even worse when the symbiont  is planted into Riker's body to resume the peace talks, and when a suitable  host comes aboard the Enterprise, the symbiont is finally placed in the  body of a woman.",963792000,,469,4.470588235294118
