8439081,3,B004RIACGS,Visually appealing. Odd narrative. And apparently the USA doesn't have a scenic route to be found,1497312000,,97,5.125
8439082,1,B004RIACGS,"There was nothing ""scenic"" about it.  In fact the scenery was boring, concentrating on continual interviews with various people who talked about the political histories of their countries.  Who ever put this together knew nothing about photographing a beautiful landscape or capturing the color in a garden.  It was a news documentary, and although informative was not at all what the ""Scenic Views"" title seemed to imply.  It finally gave me a headache, and I turned it off.",1484956800,2,475,5.051282051282051

8439084,5,B004RIACGS,"I rented this at the library and boy did I learn a lot about different countries. I may come back here and buy it here as it is at a great price. Sit down with your kids and watch it with them. They will love it too!!!
