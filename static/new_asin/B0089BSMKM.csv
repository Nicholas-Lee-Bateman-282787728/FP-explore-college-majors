5140898,3,B0089BSMKM,it is a good product no problem with it,1411948800,,39,3.4444444444444446
5140899,4,B0089BSMKM,voice acting is great. Only thing is they pattern themselves after the A-team. IT's not bad idea for season 1 but eventually they need to change the story where they are an active new unit with many members. But otherwise its a good storyline.,1411603200,,243,4.545454545454546
5140900,5,B0089BSMKM,Really enjoyed the series it was totally enjoyable and I wish they would create more on this Thank you alot,1377043200,,107,4.4
5140901,5,B0089BSMKM,G.I. Joe Season 2 Renegade shows how some of the main characters that were frame for a crime they did not commit. While on the run they are trying to get evidence to clear there name and uncover a more sinister plot from group call Cobra that is trying to take over the world. This is a prequeal on how G.I. Joe The Real American Hero comes about.,1372809600,,347,4.117647058823529
5140902,5,B0089BSMKM,"(Review for volumn 1&2 together.)
This is a great GI Joe series, if a bit astray from the usual incarnations of the ""Real American Heroes"".

This series is more of a combination GI Joe and the A-Team, but it works. Also, the characters have more depth to them than any other film version of the series to date.

I was not too thrilled with the concept of the vipers, but could live with it.

The best part, however, (and this had me worried as I watched through the series) is that it has closure at the end. It did not end with a cliffhanger and a cancelled season 2, but concluded the story line. So if you are reluctant to purchase because Season 2 had been cancelled, go ahead and give it a try. You will be getting a complete story.",1362960000,3,737,4.212765957446808
5140903,4,B0089BSMKM,I have never seen these on TV and were just cuirous since I have seen the old cartoons. I must say that the news ones are really well made and the story is quiet interesting and different to the original story.,1357603200,,210,4.146341463414634
5140904,4,B0089BSMKM,I love this series well to be honest snakes makes the show worth watch as it did for me when I use to watch the original series as a kid!,1351382400,5,137,3.6
5140905,5,B0089BSMKM,"In this version Cobra runs the world!  It's G.I. Joe and it's renegade team that are fighting for freedom.  The animation and writing are top notch.  The General is voiced by my favorite actor, Lee Majors.  Lee, if you know your 70's TV, portrayed The Six Million Dollar Man!

The stories are fast paced and the characters are even better than the ones in the original.  If you like G.I. Joe, the original or modern version, this one's a keeper.  It's worth your time and money if you like this franchise.  Rarely do these re-boots work.  This one in particular; gets it right!",1349222400,4,577,4.524271844660194

5140910,5,B0089BSMKM,These final episodes of G.I. Joe: Renegades are as entertaining as the first set of episodes and I wish they would had continued this one despite we almost had a second season but this is a must own!,1433548800,,199,4.2631578947368425
5140911,5,B0089BSMKM,"Season two of one of the most awesomest shows every created is something every fan of G.I. Joe must have. If you like Transformers or other Hasbro shows, you'll love this one too. Be sure to get Volume 1 too to complete your set and see how it all began.",1430956800,,254,4.1

8526293,3,B0089BSMKM,"7 year old wanted to know what GI Joe was.  If you're looking for nostalgia, look elsewhere.  Lots of talking and cliche generic plot- A-team meets Captain America maybe?  Was hoping for episodes with a bad guy who had an evil stupid plot, stuff exploded, repeat.",1483660800,,263,4.673913043478261

8526296,4,B0089BSMKM,Fun series but sadly short lived. Starts with a nice base of characters and introduces additional characters through their (mis)adventures. A downside is that it's the same main characters as most of the recent iterations of G.I. Joe.,1458086400,,234,5.184210526315789
