8189800,1,B000P7VOO4,This was utter garbage. It was like eating vomit. All the old stuff from the real movie redemption with a bunch of people desperate to associate themselves with Stanley. Wow. Not one single new bit of information just chopped up old interviews from American Gangster also and cameos by the same old people who always show up to say nothing. DONT WAIST A DIME ON THIS. It is hard to open up the flick. It starts off rough the cinemetography well its more like Youtubeography is just trash. TRASH sorry to say it but just have to. I give them one star for at least keeping it real and having Stanley in the story thats the other big thing happening now. The thing they do to get paid  is to try to remove him completely from the legacy he was executed for creating. Just shows how desperate people are. I pray for all the people desperate enought to try to exploit a situation like this one. God help the needy greedy people who lack wisdom. May they come to see it and ask you for it as you said you give it liberally to those who make the request. Stanley is proof of your diligence in keeping your word on this matter. He asked and died a wise man. Though he started his life as a self proclaimed wretched fool. He died a wise man.,1308873600,,1232,4.242553191489361
