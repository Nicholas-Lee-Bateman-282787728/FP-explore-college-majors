8545136,4,B009XML8YI,"Howling follows detective Jo Sang-gil (Song Kang-ho) and his new partner, Cha Eun-young (Lee Na-young) as they take what seems to be a simple suicide case. However, they eventually realize it may be a homicide case, and the suspect may not be human. Howling is a gripping mystery/thriller.

I enjoyed Howling's story; it moved at a fast pace and had several great twists to keep the audience on its feet. The mystery and action elements blend very well along with a pinch of humor, and create an immersive and entertaining experience. A few intense confrontations and chase scenes, with several scenes of extensive research and interrogation. The ending was very effective, and may be sad for some people. (I won't spoil it.) The music was amazing, and so was the cinematography. The acting was also great from both of the leads. The movie doesn't give as much detail into the characters at times, though; in flashback scene we see Cha Eun-young life before her transfer- instead of an in-depth look, we see husband and wife happy together one second, then her husband basically divorces her through text message the next.

Overall, Howling delivers mystery and thrills with a great ending. As of 03/31/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, since it doesn't seem to be available any other way.

Howling has strong violence and blood (including dog fights shown from afar), no nudity or sex.",1364774400,,1401,4.927966101694915
8545137,4,B009XML8YI,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. The Asians, in this case Koreans, just seem to have a knack for making crime thrillers. The plotting always seems fresh. I rarely know where a story is headed and this is no exception.

Here's the scoop. Some mysterious killings have taken place. They show, among other things, evidence of dog attacks. A female detective, Eun Young, has just been made detective. The all guy squad is none too happy about that. They, and her partner who has just been passed up for a promotion, treat her like dirt. They plod along in the investigation and it leads them to some very unexpected places.

There is a lot to like about this movie. The lead characters are good. The plot is generally good and it has a couple of false endings. There were times I thought the story was going to wrap up but there was still so much time left I had to wonder how many turns were left. In that the killings do involve a dog there is a rather sappy element that enters the proceedings. And some of the music underscores that big time. I've seen the lead actor, Kang-ho Song, in several movies and he's always been good. He has a very unlikely camera face. The female detective, played by Na-yeong Lee, has a delicate face with gorgeous eyes. It's a real shocker to see how abhorrently she's treated. Were this set in the U.S. every one of these guys would be in court on harassment charges. All the technical aspects of the production, save for some of the music, were of a professional level. This is just a good movie overall.

It might not be quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's still a heck of a watch. If you're into crime thrillers, have at it.",1362787200,,1675,4.345047923322683
