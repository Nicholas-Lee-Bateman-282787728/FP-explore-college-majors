Loving it!",1408406400,,79,3.4444444444444446
7900028,2,7799819898,"This series shows its age. Whilst the video quality improves after the first disk, the series is poorly conceived. The endless scenes of bowing, laughing, eating/drinking soon become very tiresome. Actual events are mostly summarised in brief narrative rather than shown .Fighting scenes are mostly just sketched. Cardboard heroes, cardboard villains. Contrast this with Red Cliffs - a perfect demonstration of how this type of film should be handled.",1392595200,,451,5.550724637681159

7900030,5,7799819898,"The only other piece of literature I could compare this to is ""War and Peace.""  It has the same scope in terms of geography.  The same incredible number of characters; and the same enormous battle (this time on boats) in the middle.
I believe that it is through the literature of a country that we can begin to understand it.  This series certainly gives an intense look into the China of about 2,000 years ago.  The similarity to what is going on today is remarkable.  well worth the time spent in watching.",1365033600,,508,4.478260869565218
7900031,5,7799819898,"Full-length(84 episodes) version of 1994 Chinese TV drama is one of the must-have for Eastern Chivalry Epic fans and periodical dramas fans. Particularly if your business concern is either China or Japan because most of them know what the basic stories and characters are. Many of proverbs in both China and Japan come from the part of this story. Every episode has full of wisdoms and because of that the epic is often picked as the teaching materials for business leaders in Japan. Japanese businessmen might have learned how to manage a large organization from Cao Cao, win the heart of talented people by the stories of Lu Bu given the Red Hare or Zhuge Liang who was given three-time visit before he became the strategist for Liu Bei. In Japan 1700-year-old epic is called SANGOKUSHI and what they are familiar with is based on the historical fiction by Ming Dynasty novelist Luo Guanzhong. Until this 1994 drama there had been no TV drama adaptations covering almost every major scene and event depicted by the 14th century novelist because the whole stories are superlong made up of whopping 120 chapters and challenges its length with Don Quixote, Tale of Genji, Gone With The Wind, Les Miserables, Moby Dick and such. Although the dramas are made so that non-Chinese viewers can understand you may not fully grasp the idea behind the characters' action. It is also recommended that you read the introductory books about Chinese history, Confucianism, San Tzu(Ce)'s The Art of War and English translation of three kingdoms epic either by Moss Roberts or C.B. Taylor. While most of Japanese fictions based on Luo Guanzhong's novel finish with Zhuge Liang's death, this drama series have seven more episodes briefly showing what happened after Zhuge Liang died.

As a Japanese three kingdoms fan, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the drama, particularly fighting sequence is realistic and it seems the actors avoid using doubles and stunts. Also the drama excellently supplements what Japanese comics and video games might have missed in detailed description of ancient traditions and dances. One complaint is that young Yuan Shao and Zhou Yu are performed by the same actor.

Verdict: Excellent and comprehensive periodical drama well introduces 1,700-year-old Chinese chivalry epic.
Rating: 94 out of 100
Recommended for: Chinese periodical dramas' fans, businessmen who often go to China or San Tzu's Art of War appreciators.",1362355200,9,2426,5.123737373737374

In this age of turmoil, heroes will rise. . .

Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a Chinese television series based on the classical novel of the same title by Luo Guanzhong. The series was produced by China Central Television (CCTV) and first aired on the network in 1994. It spanned a total of 84 episodes, each approximately 45 minutes long. One of the most expensive television series produced at that time, the project was completed over four years and involved 400,000 cast and crew members, including divisions of the People's Liberation Army from the Beijing, Nanjing and Chengdu military regions. Most of the dialogues spoken by characters were adapted directly from the novel. Extensive battle scenes were live-acted, such as the battles of Guandu, Red Cliffs and Xiaoting.

As any television show filmed two decades ago, production values have improved. Barring that, I enjoyed this series immensely. If there is a complaint, it would be the subtitles. Have your remote handy as you may have to pause once in a while to catch all the dialogue, or make sense of some of the phrasing/spelling, this dropped it a star.

All in all I enjoyed it.",1355616000,12,1332,4.778260869565218
