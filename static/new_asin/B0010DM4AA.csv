Volume 2: A strange girl appears and says that Yuichi did something to her that, well, she can't seem to remember. This part of the series will make you cry (me, I don't but I was pretty damn close), but it will make you smile, too.",1419206400,,413,4.294871794871795
8237658,5,B0010DM4AA,This volume is very funny and it is mostly about Makoto. The artwork is very neat and beautifully drawn. The story has both humor and meaning. I highly recommend this volume since it is quite unique from other anime.,1325980800,,216,4.564102564102564
8237659,5,B0010DM4AA,"Kanon is a great show, very funny and very high production values. If you're a anime fan and a collector this is a no-brainer.",1210291200,,126,4.291666666666667
8237660,5,B0010DM4AA,Kyoto animation comes through again with their beautiful art work in this excellent anime. I highly recommend.,1208390400,3,110,5.529411764705882

8237662,5,B0010DM4AA,"First of all, I am glad I finally got this item.  No I did not get it from Amazon, I got it from dvdpacific and a lot cheaper than amazon and it's in stock (low stock to be exact) Update: On order.  Before I start the review I have to say the box art is excellent, though it's missing some of the girls of Kanon, but still good.  Also, I actually got Volume 3 before getting this item so that tells you how this item is hard to get at the moment.  Well unto the review.

The disc contains episodes 5-8 and it starts off from the last scene from the 1st disc.  Yuichi is still a very curious teen as he wants to get himself involved in other people's affairs quite often.  He starts spending more time with Mai and her friend Sayuri (even started to eat lunch together with them).  He converses more with Shiori as she often visits the school that she cannot attend.  Also, Ayu is not forgotten at all in this volume as there are flashback memories between Ayu and Yuichi that explains a bit of background story for the both of them.  Nayuki doesn't have a huge role during this volume.  This volume focuses mainly on Makoto than any of the other characters as she is constantly playing pranks on Yuichi and is always failing to succeed.  Also, Yuichi begins to care more for Makoto as he is trying to figure out who she is and why he remembers her.  In all, this volume is filled with a lot of comedy as well as some serious content as well.  Yuichi is a stand out character for the series and one of the reasons why I enjoy watching Kanon.  The art and animation is still very impressive and the music matches well with each scene.

In conclusion, I found this volume to be very enjoyable with the character developments (exception would be Nayuki since she is not much different from the 1st volume).  I highly recommend it and please if you are interested in the box and cannot wait for Amazon to get it in stock, you can visit dvdpacific (I'm not here to advertise for them but helping out those who can't seem to find this box set anywhere online).",1205884800,,2053,4.27720207253886

And a quick note on this version - I'd recommend this version over the other, as the box (aside from having some really nice art) will come in handy once all of the DVDs have been released.",1198972800,10,620,8.841269841269842
