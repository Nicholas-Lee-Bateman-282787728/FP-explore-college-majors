1688023,2,B0000639GI,"First of all, I've got to say that I have been a big Knack fan ever since Columbia House sent me a copy of ""Get The Knack"" on 8-track in 1980. And if that wasn't enough, Doug Fieger even went to the same high school as I did in Michigan--although he was gone long before I got there.
So when I saw that Direct TV was showing free previews of this DVD all weekend, I figured this would be right up my alley. Well, I've sat through this turkey twice already, and I'm still counting the ways where they went wrong with this one.
First of all, the mix is awful. The guitars are WAY down, especially Berton's sublime lead work, and all that is coming through is vocals and drums. This is fine for RUN-DMC, but it ain't doing much for The Knack.
Secondly, when it comes to the look of the overall piece, this thing has ""cable access"" written all over it . Flat lighting, uninspired set design, and arbitrary camera work hardly kept my interest for more than a few minutes, and I'm getting this for free!
Finally, this performance is fairly loose and detatched for the most part. I've got a copy of their Carnegie Hall performance from a while back, and that thing runs rings around this DVD. I've got a feeling that the band has a lot riding on this one, but I think they would have been better served re-releasing the Carnegie Hall performance on DVD and leaving well-enough alone.",1020556800,,1376,4.357976653696498
1688024,5,B0000639GI,I have to admit that I was only a casual Knack fan back in their heyday but took a chance on this DVD. I'm glad I did as it is superb. It is power pop at it's finest with top notch picture and sound quality. The idea of appearing on a 60's type TV show works very well. The band looks great and really seem to be enjoying themselves. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in seeing power pop at it's finest.,1020297600,,421,4.023809523809524
1688025,5,B0000639GI,"The Knack, possibly the most underrated rock band in the history of the genre, look and sound incredible on this new live video and audio. Unfortunately tagged as ""one hit wonders"" by people who know very little about music, this band had 3 Top 40 hits and several other critically acclaimed releases and they're all represented here. Along with Knack staples such as ""My Sharona"" and ""Baby Talks Dirty,"" awesome pop classics such as ""Sweet Dreams,"" ""Harder on You"" and ""Siamese Twins"" are played to perfection. This is a great buy for anyone who wants to know what quality power pop is all about. Bands don't get much catchier nor more talented than The Knack and hopefully, with this release, people will get it again!",1019865600,,720,4.768
1688026,5,B0000639GI,"if youve never seen the knack in person here is the next best thing. they are excellent musicians and there songs have incredible hooks! most people only remember ""My Sharona"", but the knack have dozens of other great songs.....i highly recommend this dvd to all fans and anyone into good power pop music!",1019520000,4,305,4.773584905660377
1688027,1,B0000639GI,"Why do they release things like this?
The Knack in 2001? Good lord! There are about 10,000 preformances and videos than need to be on DVD more than this sad little exabition, even many KNACK circa 1979 Performences/Videos would be welcomed.",1017619200,2,240,4.878048780487805

7958668,1,B0000639GI,"First, I have to say I love the KNACK,there's a great track list ,BUT, who ever mixed this has got no future in the music bizz! Second,the mix of the entire video is horrible. I saw this video on TV , and it was a great video..so I bought it thinking it would be the same thing,it sounded great on TV ,,the mix again is just awful... sorry to say, pass on this one !",1401926400,,366,3.8933333333333335
7958669,4,B0000639GI,"The Knack were one of the most under-rated pop/rock bands ever. Doug Fieger was a wonderful frontman and composer, who penned the tunes John Lennon wished he could have gotten away with. Great period flavor with the faux-sixties production (though you do get a glimpse of a modern HD camera). Mister Jimmy Lemonjello is not funny, though. Wish they had included a couple more of the commercial parodies a la ""The Who Sell Out"". Not just good fun-this was a bloody good rock and roll band. DVD will get plenty of use here.",1366934400,,521,4.612903225806452
7958670,5,B0000639GI,"I was raised listening to GOOD GIRLS DONT in my childhood years and never had the chance to see THE KNACK LIVE.

Imagine looking at a 60s show and THE KNACK playing their hearts out. This is what this DVD is all about. BRUCE GARY is an amazing drummer, but the drummer who is filling his shoes on here, did an amazing job. Played with a lot of fire.

The band here smokes plain and simple and was very very..very tight.

They cover mostly a lot of new material that is very good from their last albums ZOOM and NORMAL AS THE NEXT GUY. The new material makes you wonder, what wouldve been the rest of the KNACK'S career if Doug Feiger didn't have a drug problem that lead eventually to the demise of the band.

I recommend this to anyone that loved the first album GET THE KNACK because the material that they recorded in ZOOM and NORMAL is along those same lines. Im getting this on CD as well.

I also recommend the DVD - GETTING THE KNACK which is a documentary of the band's career and is on sale here for almost nothing from independent sellers.

DOUG FEIGER AND BRUCE GARY - R.I.P.

This is a glimpse of the quality of the material that they couldve still be recording today if Dough Feiger didn't passed away.

TWO THUMBS UP ALL THE WAY!!",1312416000,,1244,4.263829787234043
7958671,4,B0000639GI,"As the reviewer earlier mentioned, there are some dubbing problems that become distracting at times. Along with a few sync issues, they re-recorded many vocal parts, taking some of the ""Live"" out of the title. It's easy to hear (and see) the difference between the live and the studio vocals.

But don't let this bother you. The overall mix is great, with excellent separation between instruments, although the bass isn't quite as punchy as I'd like. Switching to the 5.1 mix and bringing down the center channel volume to a nice blend (vs home theater mode ""center channel = main speaker"" mode) helps the bass quite a bit. Guitar tone is simply outstanding, and as also mentioned earlier, it's like a candy shop for beautiful instruments. When I took this down to our bandroom years ago for my friends to hear, my first words were ""Even if you're not a Knack fan, it's worth it to see the guitars.""

""Get The Knack"" is the only CD I had from them, and I was impressed by songs on this DVD I didn't know. ""Pop Is Dead"", ""Baby Talks Dirty"", ""Can I Borrow a Kiss""....all these I had never heard before, and I was blown away. I mean, I knew these guys were good, but they're REAL good. It's a shame that they're written off by so many as one hit wonders. Great writing, great vocals, great playing, and hooks that are off the HOOK.

Buy this DVD, accept the fact that there are some dubbing issues, and relax and slip back to a time when songs made you feel good. The Knack gets the job done here.",1193443200,,1494,4.405797101449275
7958672,3,B0000639GI,"I quite enjoyed watching the Knack mime to a new recorded track, as the performance captures the fun and excitement of a live Knack show. The newly recorded songs sound great, the band looks good, and the set is full of energy. I may have to get the audio CD as well, since it sounds so good! I like watching Berton Averre's fingers fly over the fretboard, and the man is such an underrated guitar player.",1127692800,,405,4.342105263157895
7958673,5,B0000639GI,"Terrific live performance by one of the genuine power-pop finest landmarks. Never be afraid of watching them in 2001, they really look and sound true, surprisingly young and fresh. The playing and singing reach the studio perfection looking effortless. Additional bonus are the astounding Moonesque drummer and the real gem guitar showcase... and almost no pauses between the songs. Essential.",1060905600,,393,5.566666666666666
7958674,3,B0000639GI,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I could not get past the cheesy production, poor lip-sync and the overall ho hum feeling of this performance. Let me say that I am a big Knack fan from the late 70's and was looking forward to another performance video to add to my collection. I think what the band was trying to do was a send off of the British 60's variety shows such as Ready, Steady Go..and that would explain the bad lip sync. In short, groups used to re-record their songs and then lip to these recordings because of union rules about playing records on television in the 60's in the UK. The problem, is that the modern production takes away from that feeling. Each member playing on a separate ministage limits interaction among the group members. Also, the moderator could have been done away with. Why didn't the band just do a live compliation video of performances? The main problem with the ""Fun House"" is that there is no fun. The audience looks as if they are on xanax. Comparing this to the Carnegie Hall video...well you really can't so I won't go there.
On the bright side, the song selection is quite good and Doug F's guitars are AMAZING. What is that...a new Epiphone Casino with the Bigsby tailpiece? Yummy. And the Harrison '64 Rick 12 string will jingle jangle you out of your seat, not to mention the (new?) Gretch Tennessean, Yee Haw. How about the Gibson J 160 E, Lennon/Harrison would be proud!
Overall I'd rather have this than not, but I wish that the concept was played out more cleanly and that there were more extras. By the way the discography on the DVD is incomplete, for some reason it omits ""Zoom""(!?!).",1023667200,11,1641,4.5286195286195285
7958675,3,B0000639GI,"First of all The knack have been criminally ignored for the last two decades! They are so much more than ""My Sharona"". I have everthing they have done and always like to encourage more product to be released by this amazing band. I was so thrilled with idea to finally have a Kanck DVD, that i ignored D. Ray
Morton's very accurate review. Part of the performance seems out of synch. It seems like they have overdubbed their performance. Why they would do this I do not know. they should have just redone the thing in someone garage and that would have spared us ""Jimmy Lemonjello"", Fieger's ""Alter-ego"". Really could have done without that.
I will say that if you are fan and have never seen them live, this DVD gives you a pretty good idea of what they are like. Song selection is OK. The disc is lean on extras. Some behind the scenes stuff would have been cool. Still, at least their is a DVD of The Knack out that will hopefully spur those who haven't seen them live to check one of America's greatest rock bands live.",1023062400,,1023,4.389473684210526
7958676,3,B0000639GI,"I kinda dig The Knack, and was surprised by how excited I was to have the chance to see this.  I tell you, though, although it is a lot of fun and they play all the right selections, somehow it appears to be oddly overdubbed--almost like they are lip-synching--though not to a studio track.  You can see many many examples of this--especially in the vocals--I forget which song, but one of the very early tracks involves many ""screams"" from the singer--they simply don't match with what he is doing--one time they have the wisdom to ""cut away.""  Why would they lip-synch to a live version of their own stuff?  This is why I say it is one of the oddest DVDs I have seen.  The entire recording seems as though it is not occuring as we are watching it.  The drums are similarly dry and do not sound like they are coming from that ""space.""  I am baffled and bothered by the detachment between what we are hearing and what we are seeing.  They allude to the possibility of something being ""up"" in this regard in the little sit down bit they do before they play--but it is edited so that they never finish the thought.  I would be most curious to hear what others think about this.  Again, songs are great, The Knack is great, that they are still doing music in their own way is great--but I am telling you I think the whole thing is overdubbed, and the results are oddly annoying.",1022198400,,1375,4.356862745098039
