I really got a kick out of  the actors' fidelity to the characters they are satirizing, it makes the movie. Alec Guinness's turn towards the end, where he adopts the manners of a different character depending on the twist introduced by each detective is deeply funny.

518182,4,6302797535,"Review of Murder by Death
Hot Toasty Rag, October 29, 2017

Murder by Death is hilarious! Spoofs have to be very careful because a lot of the time, they don't turn out to be as funny as the people making it think it will be. This one, written by Neil Simon, spoofs the whodunnit genre. Five spoofs of famous literary detectives are invited to dinner by a mysterious hostmirroring Agatha Christies U.N. Owens in And Then There Were None. The characters: Peter Sellars playing Sidney Wang, spoofing Charlie Chan; David Niven and Maggie Smith playing Dick and Dora Charleston, spoofing Nick and Nora Charles; Peter Faulk playing Sam Diamond, spoofing Sam Spade; Elsa Lanchester playing Jessica Marbles, spoofing Miss Marple, and James Coco playing Milo Perrier, spoofing Hercule Poirot.

If you haven't seen or read any of these classic detective stories, youll pass a few giggles and come out of this thinking its enormously weird. However, if you know about Hercule Poirots mustache, Nick and Noras endless drinking, and have seen Bogart and Bacall movies, youll be set for a hilarious, laugh-filled evening. From the tiniest details to the largest set-ups, this film will deliver laughs, chuckles, and guffaws at every turn. Joining the large cast are Alec Guiness, Truman Capote, Eileen Brennan, Estelle Winwood, and James Cromwell in his first movie. This is a great movie to watch around Halloween, for those who prefer to laugh rather than scream, or right after youve watched one of the classic it spoofs.",1509235200,,1510,5.01195219123506
518183,5,6302797535,One of my favorite movies of all time. There is no other movie like this one. It hits on all cylinders from start to finish.,1509148800,,124,4.0
518184,5,6302797535,"I saw Murder by Death in the theater when I was a kid.  I liked it so much I stayed and saw the second showing, which was allowed in those days. I've passed on my love for this film to my son, and we take turns using the best lines in our everyday lives.  When I was young I tried to figure out exactly who was the actual victim and murderer, which of course I now realize is an indecipherable mystery wrapped inside a conundrum, and that's the point with this fantastically fun screwball comedy.  Don't try to make sense of it...you can't. Just enjoy the zany plot and fantastic actors of the silver screen. The DVD quality is very good and I have not had any issues or problems with it.",1508544000,3,688,4.196969696969697

518398,4,6302797535,"An underrated cult classic film by playwright Neil Simon (he of ""The Odd Couple"" fame) and theater director Robert Moore, this is possibly the perfect film for mystery lovers, both of prose and screen.

The setup is simple: the entire story is a parody of the classic murder mystery whodunit put against the backdrop of an old country mansion on a dark and stormy night. Five people have been invited to the estate for 'dinner and a murder' by the mysterious and eccentric multi-millionaire Lionel Twain (played by Truman Capote in a rare acting appearance), who is assisted that evening by blind butler Jamessir Bensonmum (played by Sir Alec Guinness a year before his legendary turn as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars) and deaf-mute maid Yetta (Nancy Walker, best known for McMillan and Wife, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and one of its spinoffs, Rhoda). His guests, however, aren't the usual cadre of socialites and high-society muckety-mucks, but instead are analogues of some of the greatest detectives in literature and film. Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), much like Nick and Nora Charles of Dashiell Hammett's Thin Man series, are a highly-sophisticated high society couple with a knack for sleuthing and a wire-haired terrier. Monsieur Milo Perrier (James Coco), who like his source material in Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot is Belgian, not French, is accompanied by his French chauffeur Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell in his feature film debut). Hard-boiled private eye Sam Diamond (played by Columbo himself, Peter Falk) spoofs another Hammett creation in Sam Spade; like Spade, he is accompanied by his long-suffering secretary, one Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan). Another Agatha Christie lampoon comes in the form of tweed-clad Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester, known to many a horror fan as the Bride of Frankenstein), a send-up of Miss Jane Marple; here, she's joined by her even more elderly former nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood), whom SHE now takes care of. Lastly, there is the character that some people today would find a tad cringe-worthy: Inspector Sidney Wang (played by the great Peter Sellers), a parody of Charlie Chan complete with an adopted Japanese son named Willie (Richard Narita); like the original 'of their time' Charlie Chan pictures, a non-Asian actor portrays the famous Chinese police detective's pastiche and of course plays up the character's comically broken English. A deleted scene from the film includes thinly-veiled analogues of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, but it's not entirely necessary to enjoy the film.

Twain invites these sleuths to dinner, only to issue them a challenge: to disprove his claim that HE is the world's greatest detective, each must solve a murder that will occur at midnight, with a $1 million reward for the winner. The result is a story that sees all manner of twists, turns, and jokes that land successfully most of the time (there are a few that don't, at least not really), with a really metafictional ending. Seeing this film is highly recommended if you're a mystery buff; and if not, the film is still funny overall.

Oh, and did I forget to mention the illustrations in the title sequence by Addams Family creator Charles Addams?",1491609600,,3252,5.109022556390977

Peter Falk as Sam Diamond, Peter Sellers as a 'Charlie Chan' spinoff detective as Inspector Wong, etc...  If you have never seen this movie before, Buy It!  You will laugh your head off!
Neil Simon outdid himself in turning this play into a movie!  Once the plot thickens, it gets more exiting at every 'comedic' turn!  Don't forget the blind butler, played by the late great Alec Guinness trying to communicate wtih the deaf and dumb maid/cook played by Nancy Walker.  You won't be

But then, it is supposed to be silly, preposterous, over the top, and absurd, and perhaps even sloppy. A lampooning of already-over-the-top characters in crime-fiction, with an excuse for a story (never properly resolved) around Truman Capote (as an actor). The ending feels rushed and going on fumes, and indeed, there was an original ending that was cut (a Sherlock Homes / Watson team comes, as the other detectives are leaving, and actually solves whatever the case may have been -- this, I think, could have been very funny). Still, one goes with these actors and their acts along with gratitude, takes the absurdity and the non-sequiturs in stride, and chuckles and laughs at a little bit of diversion on a rainy or lazy day.",1474070400,,890,4.785714285714286

Maggie Smith is as understated as ever, David Niven dapper, and Peter Falk rough around the edges as Columbo turned Sam (Spade) Diamond.  But the movie is silly and dated.  I doubt any writer would be as cavalier with racial stereotypes and poking fun at the handicapped as Simon is here, but this movie is 70s vintage.  However, bad puns and awful accents are rescued by witty repartee and clever names.  Reminiscent of Young Frankenstein and Animal House, but not as good.",1466985600,,632,4.589285714285714

Smart writing delivered by the best actors of the time. Too often movie makers try to grab a lot of name actors and toss them together in a mediocre plot to sell tickets. Not here. The cast is top notch and, for the most part, collaborate well to complement each other in putting the whole thing together. Truman Capote is not as great an actor but he does not hurt the production. Enjoy.

518806,3,6302797535,"As a parody of murder mystery stories,(which is certainly its central purpose)  it definitely works. The riffs on specific novel (and later film and TV adaptaiton) detectives and other character types are pretty well executed. The humor is reasonably funny and the situation reasonably absurd. I liked what this movie is trying to do enough to give it three stars.

But its missing some things you might assume it would have going for it, and it carries a pretty high degree of baggage.

As far as whats missing, keep in mind that this is certainly parody and not satire. Its a very silly movie. Theres not a lot of nuance to anything that goes on, and my conclusion is that theres no purposeful social commentary. (What little commentary there is on the subject matter being parodied is helpfully narrated as exposition by Truman Capotes character.)

Similarly, with such an all-star cast, you might expect truly fine acting or razor-sharp timing. I think the characters do work as their intended parodies, but this is nobodys finest performance. The combined acting talent gathered in the cast doesnt really elevate the material. In a few moments, garish sound and visual effects are used to sell mediocre gags. Sometimes, the jar seems to be for its own comic effect, but in those isolated moments, it serves to bring the acting in that scene down with it.

Finally on the whats missing list, if youve seen other mystery parodies like Clue, you might expect that the plot of this movie is tailored well enough that the audience might follow it along as it would a straight mystery. Or that the conclusion will wrap up loose ends in an entertaining way. Definitely not. This is a parody of the characters and a couple of tropes, and the plot is only there to give them something to do.

But those shortcomings are not as jarring as the cultural baggage.

The argument could be made that Peter Sellers yellowface performance is simply a straight execution of the kind of characterization used in other depictions of the Charlie Chan character. The racism dripping off of his every appearance is then a commentary on the racism of the previous characterizations, and on the racial issues inherent in that character. (Blazing Saddles might be a reasonably successful example of that line of thought.) But that angle doesnt make the character any less offensive to modern viewers, and in my opinion the writing and tone of the movie simply don't bear that explanation out. In my opinion, the nature of its execution is possibly somewhat benign, but the end result is blatantly racist.

Similarly, Peter Falks Sam Spade parody accurately espouses the outspoken nature and social viewpoints of that kind of period character. That kind of accuracy really can add to the effectiveness (in this case humor) of the character. But theres no getting around the offensive nature of a couple of his lines, and they don't appear to be part of any further satire or commentary.

Not as jarring, but still potentially problematic, is the depiction of the blind butler character. There are some genuinely funny comedy that comes out of his coming at situations at cross-purposes to the other characters. And the nature of this and the deaf and mute maid character is a relevant parody of the side characters with broad traits as potential red herrings trope. This adds to the movies greatest asset  the absurdity of it all. But of course this means the disabled is often the butt of the joke, and sometimes they seem to be even when maybe they're not.

If you like parody in general enough, or the specific murder mystery characters and tropes enough, or you're trying to see one of the actors complete body of work, or you're curious enough, then this movie is probably still worth it, just as that kind of exercise. But go in with both eyes open.

For anyone else, I would expect the cultural price of admission to be too high, and Id say stick to Clue.",1454284800,2,3939,4.776470588235294

Actually a very well done spoof....engaging, amusing, fun to watch.  I have probably watched it 5 or 6 or more times (which is a lot for me), mostly on DVD.  Best ever!!  If you have not seen it yet, buy it, or find it somewhere, and watch it.....that is, if you like mysteries, and maybe even it you do not, just for the very famous actors and their characterizations of various well-known sleuths (Miss Marple and her nurse, the Thin Man and his wife, Charlie Chan and son, Poirot and associate, Sam Spade and his adoring secretary).  All these detectives have been invited to a dinner party and overnight at a somewhat spooky mansion.  Even John Gielgud gets in the action, as the blind butler who is trying to serve a dinner party with the necessary aid of a deaf and dumb cook who is new to the estate and appears unable to catch on as to what she is supposed to do.....just a little taste of the fun throughout the movie.",1424131200,,1088,4.437185929648241

519289,5,6302797535,"If you are looking for silly slapstick, crude humor, or juvenile behavior you will not like this film. The lines are fast and you need to pay attention to catch them all to really experience this well-written script. The characters are humorous takes on famous detectives and Peter Sellers portrayal of Sidney Wang needs to be taken as a joke and not a racial slur. Yes, if you take the Chinese detective's character out of the film's context then it can be seen as offensive with his fortune-cookie lines, rabbit teeth and make-up enhaned slanted eyes - but that is the point of his character - an exaggeration of the way Charlie Chan was portrayed by Swedish actor Warner Oland in the 1930s. The cast is brilliant and the fast rapier wit is filled with quoatble lines that never fail to make me laugh no matter how many times I watch this entertaining film.",1422662400,,859,4.584415584415584

519312,2,6302797535,"This is a film that I'm sure was probably well-received and lauded as quite funny when it was first released, but the jokes just do not hold up by today's standards, largely because many of them are based upon racist tropes and making fun of people with disabilities. I watched this movie with some friends recently on the understanding that it was a murder-mystery comedy similar to Clue, and we found most of the 'jokes' extremely uncomfortable. From Peter Sellars in yellowface as Inspector Wang to Truman Capote's character screaming at him for not being able to speak English perfectly, racist jokes and stereotypes abound. Wang also has an adopted son who is made the butt of jokes for being adopted and/or Japanese. Additionally, there are many jokes made at the expense of the blind butler and deaf-mute cook who can't communicate with one another.

It's possible that a fan of murder mystery novels and movies could enjoy this film's many references to characters from that genre who are being parodied, but unless you are a murder mystery buff or need a movie to entertain your racist grandparents, I would encourage you to save your money for the better quality/less offensive movie Clue.",1420329600,2,1199,4.906403940886699

This is a spoof of every classic detective character.  Keep your eyes open, as there are a lot of small visual gags in addition to the verbal humor.

Just a warning, for those who will be upset:  This movie is from 1976, so the standards were a little different for what was appropriate.  Peter Sellers plays a Chinese man (who has an adopted Japanese son, played by Richard Narita), and the portrayal by Sellers is going to be offensive to someone.",1420156800,,676,4.439024390243903

519351,5,6302797535,"I love this movie.  It was made in a time when racism and ethnic stereotypes were acceptable, so the viewer has to get past those.  Falk and Sellers steal every scene they are in and headline what is an all-star cast.  I found the humor more along the lines of Mel Brooks than a traditional Neil Simon screenplay.  Alec Guinness offers a subtle yet very humorous performance.  As a Downton Abbey fan, nice to recall that Maggie Smith was once somewhat hot and racy.  Capote is miscast and seems to be stretching.

519391,2,6302797535,"A waste of celluloid.  I remember when this film first came out, and then seeing it a year or two later on HBO.  It was called a comedy, but I didn't find anything particularly funny.  I didn't laugh once when I initially saw it, and after seeing it again, I think I laughed twice.

Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this film.  I truly and honestly did.  But to be honest, I can't even remember the gags I laughed at.

On the other hand, the dialogue sounds like this would have made a great radio play.  If you close your eyes you might actually crack a smile, otherwise the timing in the humor is more than a little off, while other gags are actually telegraphed.

Don't get me wrong.  I am a Neil Simon fan.  I grew up watching his various plays, TV adaptations and films, but occasionally he did strike out with a massive wiff, and I think Murder by Death falls into that category.

I can shoot a funnier film with the same material.",1418256000,,954,4.238888888888889

519493,3,6302797535,"My expectations of Murder By Death were probably just too high. I'm a lifelong mystery fan who also adores comedies and parodies, and a lot of the actors in this film rank among my all-time favorites. ""Clue"", another mystery spoof to which this movie is often compared, is one of my ten 'desert island' movies. (Which, yes, I know is rather sad!) Anyway, for all those reasons and more, I expected Murder By Death to become a special favorite. Instead, I found myself thinking that this movie, though certainly enjoyable, fell woefully short of its potential.

Let me stress that there ARE some funny and highly entertaining bits, and, honestly, I'd enjoy watching this particular cast read the phone book. (Hence the 3.5 stars as opposed to a lower ranking!) But the overall humor was a lot more sophomoric than I'd expected, more like my least favorite bits from a Mel Brooks film than the clever, witty and sharp satire I'd anticipated. A few people noted that Neil Simon realized by age 16 that he hated detective novels, and it feels like that same immature teenager was in charge of too much of this script. And while writers certainly don't have to harbor much affection for the targets they're parodying (though it often helps!), they should at least have a great deal of familiarity with them. Instead, it often felt like Simon barely knew the famous detectives he was lampooning or murder mystery tropes in general.

Humor is wildly subjective, of course, so I'm not surprised that others loved this more than I did. And let me stress that I DO think it's a movie worth seeing. Given the incredibly rich premise and the stellar cast, however, I can't shake the sense that this film could have been much better than it actually was.",1411084800,11,1741,4.723684210526316

But it all somehow works; no doubt in large part to an amazing cast...many of whom you would not normally expect to see in a comedy.  I you liked Clue, this is it's slightly hokier but endearingly kooky Dad.
It is a shame they didn't do more with the format and YES there are scenes missing.  But I don't even know anyone who still owns a VCR so unless someone decides to do a Maggie Smith Criterion-style retrospective, this is your only option...except the RARE instance when TCM or  TBS runs it.",1409875200,3,601,4.378378378378378

519566,3,6302797535,"As a fan of classic whodunit, I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and entertaining. There were a lot of inside jokes pertaining to mystery films series like The Thin Man, Charlie Chan, and Miss Marple that were fun for a fan of the genre but may not be appreciated by mainstream viewers. It's almost worth watching just for the sensational cast which includes: David Niven, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Peter Falk and many more notables.

The 80's home edition of Neil Simon's MURDER BY DEATH (with b&w cover photo) is a good quality transfer. Its box is designed for security, with the tape removed for playing from the side rather than the bottom; a side flap tucks in to prevent the video from accidentally falling out.

In this classic mid-70s farce, five detectives (based on such fictional characters as Sam Spade and Hercule Poirot) and their sidekicks are invited to an atmospheric mansion for dinner and an opportunity to solve a murder that will occur at exactly midnight. People, and even the house itself are not what they appear to be: false identities, trick rooms and hidden passages add to the challenge.

An all-star cast, Robert Moore's direction and one of Simon's wittiest scripts make this who-dun-it a delight throughout. (TRIVIA: The screaming doorbell is Fay Wray from the 1933 RKO feature, KING KONG.)

519910,3,6302797535,"The obligatory dark and stormy night is taken to task in this parody of crime novels.  Set in a mansion located in the middle of nowhere, guests arrive in time for a good tongue lashing.  Why Neil Simon felt the need to upbraid famous literary characters rather than their creators is a moot point but one that shouldn't be ignored.  Assuming Simon had a point to make rather than just taking potshots at better authors who have created some of the most enduring characters in all of literature.

For me, Simon's humor was hit and miss.  I chuckled a few times, enjoyed several of the actors (felt sorry for others in the cast).  I thought Peter Sellers was perfect as Charlie Chan.  I love Elsa Lanchester as a general rule.  Alec Guinness had the toughest role and did the most with it.  Nancy Walker was wasted in a role that required little and little were the results.  She was literally the brunt of the joke.
Some of the jokes were inspired, some were just plain desperate (as with the house numbers of the estate: two two twain).  Truman Capote's appearance was suspect from the start and did little to help the cause.

Whether or not you'll enjoy this movie depends entirely on your sense of humor, whether you're acquainted with any of the literary characters involved, or whether you enjoy one author lampooning the work of dead authors who can't defend themselves from the ridicule heaped upon them.

This is the second time I've watched this movie.  Back in the 70s, I thought it was fun, now, not so much.",1372982400,,1519,4.5777777777777775
519911,4,6302797535,"Old fashioned murder mystery comedy. If only they were all so amusing! I have to admit to not being familiar with most of the originals the cast is spoofing in this farce aside from mainly Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, but I could appreciate it none the less. It's interesting to read a little about the Detective Charlie Chan history, the character was created to combat negative stereotypes yet the original Asian actors garnered little popular success for the character and were later played by a Swede and an American to more acclaim and appeal. When a comedian does something irreverent, such as using a broken Chinese-American accent I guess it's best to take it as pointing out flaws in our perceptions of culture instead of taking offense. Peter Sellers got to have the most fun with his character and provided the better part of the humor. Truman Capote's presence on screen didn't excite me as much as some of the other reviewers, before this I knew him as an author, and after this I will still think of him as an author. Much of the humor was lighthearted and there were a lot of puns. The ending was ridiculous, as it should have been. It only illustrates the frustration a lot of mystery readers feel about late introduced characters or misdirection in stories that seem to make no sense at the conclusion and the revelation of the guilty party. If you can't keep them guessing, at least keep them laughing.",1372723200,2,1423,4.673306772908367

520057,3,6302797535,"I was reading an article in Vanity Fair about Truman Capote and MURDER BY DEATH was mentioned so I thought it was time to see this film. The major plus of this film is the chance to see some beloved and popular actors..most of whom are long gone. Sadly, the younger generation may not recognize the names in this film and the great esteem these actors were held in. Several of the actors in MURDER BY DEATH had already been stars for decades when this film was released in 1976.

So for those of us of a certain age, it is a joy to see several beloved actors ""alive"" again. What a dream cast with Petter Sellers, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennan, James Coco, Peter Falk and Eileen Brennan. There is also a young James Cromwell in the cast. Maggie Smith is still going strong as the grand dame of acting and it is fun to see her young and sexy. MURDER BY DEATH is based on a Neil Simon play so we know already it will be a great show. Each of the actors is doing a comedic take of literary and film detectives from the past. Peter Falk is hilarious as Humphrey Bogart/Sam Spade. There is Elsa Lanchester as Jessica Marbles. Peter Sellers is a totally send on Charlie Chan--making a politically incorrect even more incorrect. Of course, this is all in fun and is giving us a laugh on famous characters. David Niven and Maggie Smith are Dick and Dora Charleston. Again, you need to know classic film to get the joke here. I am afraid a lot of the humor could be lost on people not familiar with older films. There is James Coco as Milo Perrier. Coco is an actor I remember fondly who we lost too soon and who sadly, probably is not remembered by most today.

I do feel the film loses steam once all the characters are introduced and we descend further and further into silliness. How do a blind butler and deaf mute maid communicate? But after a while, the joke is lost and we are replaying the same gags over and over. The film does seem very dated but of course, it is from the mid-70's. The real fun in this film is not the story as much as seeing some great actors together.",1353283200,6,2098,4.282115869017632

In any case, I watch this thing probably once a year or more as a tradition. And though I know probably the whole thing by heart (a la The Holy Grail), it is still a joy to watch it. The characters are wonderful, the actors are even more so. Being a huge Peter Sellers fan probably pushes my bias meter over, but so what. Throw in David Niven, Peter Falk, Captoe--the cast could not have been better, I think.

There is, of course, a final twist in this thing. For those who have not watched it before, it is one of the better ones out there, and a prime way for Simon to poke at all of the pulp mystery writers and their works.

Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites a group of famous fictional detectives to his spooky old mansion for ""dinner and a murder."" So we have Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), Milo Perrier (James Coco), Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), and Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), as satires of Sam Spade, Miss Jane Marple, Hercule Poirot, Nick and Nora Charles, and Charlie Chan. Then there is Alec Guinness as the blind butler and Nancy Walker as the deaf and dumb maid. The jokes get pretty tacky with this lot, as you can imagine. And don't expect the plot to make any sense.

520077,2,6302797535,"Murder By Death, 1976 film

A man sends invitations to famous detectives (from fiction) to visit his mansion. [No mention of fees, so you know this isn't real.] Lionel Twain lives on an island. A rickety bridge connects to this island. The detectives arrive and are shown to their rooms. The new cook cannot speak, hear, or read English. The butler can't see. They try to communicate. Sam Diamond arrives with his secretary Tess. Next Dick and Dora Charleston. Inspector Wang arrives with his son Willy. Inspector Perrier arrives with his chauffeur Marcel. Is Wang wrong? Miss Jessica Marbles arrives with her nurse. Why five detectives? Perrier explains the test with Wang. Blind people have a keen sense of smell. ""Tacky?"" The blind butler talks to the deaf cook. The lights go dead. ""Franks and beans?"" Then Lionel Twain appears. [No joke here.] ""You look like number two.""

Can the five greatest detectives solve a murder in a locked mansion? Two million cash plus film rights? Charades? The cook draws their attention. ""This man is dead."" ""Where is everyone?"" A voice speaks to them. ""Say your pronouns."" They find the butler again. Then the dining room is empty again. [A cheap trick?] ""Two dining rooms."" The cook disappeared. Midnight passes. They find a body, as predicted. ""Nobody move!"" Dick Charleston offers a solution, but Inspector Wang trumps him (and exposes a character). ""I'm a Belgie!"" There are more exposures and confessions from the others. [Believable?] There are threats for the occupants of each bedroom. [More silliness here.] Sidney Wang solves the crime! Who did it? A plastic body. Others have their solution. ""How did you know?"" There is a final surprise! When the show is over the detectives all leave. There is a final unmasking to end this story. Believable?

This is a parody of Agatha Christie's famous murder mystery ""Ten Little Indians"". Those who write parodies are usually less talented than the original writer, as shown by this story. If you don't know of the other fictional detectives you will miss the point of this story. A parody is limited to the original story. The ending with the switching of identities damages this story, as if they don't know when to end this joke.
Dashiell created ""Nick and Nora Charles"" and ""Sam Spade""(""The Thin Man"", ""The Maltese Falcon""). ""Mr Wong"" was a copy of ""Charlie Chan"". Agatha Christie created ""Hercule Poirot"" and ""Miss Marple"" for many mystery novels.",1331856000,2,2439,4.958435207823961

All the characters from various films and books are gathered together in a single castle - similar to Agatha Christie's ""And then there were None."" The characters are all parodies of these characters, cleverly done.

Charlie Chan is now Sidney Wang (and his son Willie - the metaphors are obvious!), played by Peter Sellers, himself an actor who played the detective in The Pink Panther.

Marbles is based on Christie's character Marples, played by Elsa Lancaster, herself in a TV murder mystery series.

Peter Falk of Columbo fame is Sam Diamond, clearly the parody of Bogart's Sam Spade.

Milo Perrier (what water?) is played by Jimmy Coco, a parody of Christie's Hercule Peroit.

And Nick & Nora Charles complete with terrier (!) being Dick and Dora Charleston, played by Maggie Smith (Harry Potter films) and David Niven.

What I liked best about the film was the interaction of all the players and how each of them parodied their respective characters. Loved Falk's Bogart accent and Niven's great William Powell imitation.

Truman Capote was perfect as the sinister mastermind behind the murders, as each detective is locked in the mansion and told that a murder will take place. The egos and silly jokes are at times just too much. And too funny!

Alec Guinness plays the blind butler with his deaf mute cook! This was just before he went into the Lucas film, Star Wars.

Memorable Moment: When Sam Diamond turns to his girl at the end and said ""You know how to blow, don't you sweetheart?"" And she says, ""What? Sam? What do you mean?"" Sam: ""Never mind, you ruined it!"" If you never saw ""To Have and Have Not"" then you will not get this joke, LOL).

Bottom Line: Non-mystery readers need not apply. Hilarious film. A must-see.",1318118400,2,2000,4.653409090909091
520101,4,6302797535,"A fun film that spoofs murder mysteries with a well known cast (from the 70s), including a relatively young James Cromwell (who wouldn't become super popular until later).  Tale focuses upon the five greatest detectives brought to the mansion of an eccentric who wants them to solve a murder before it happens as well as prove to said five detectives that he's more clever than all of them combined. For an old film the humor was impressively delivered. Nice pickup of pace in the end, too. Four scenes (including one with Sherlock Holmes) were deleted from the film but shown in the original broadcast. The script for this film was nominated by the Academy Awards.

I'm a huge fan of 'whodunnit' type of movies and I have to say there was absolutely no regret purchasing this movie because it's completely hilarious! It actually spoofs 'detectives' stories.. because you see, in majority if not all mystery movies and books, when we try to figure out the clues given and solve mystery and guessing the potential suspect, at the end they always give out theories and answers that were never given in the clues at the beginning! That's one point this movie is trying to point out... the ending is absolutely ridiculous and mind boggling, it's hilarious.

If you're a fan of 'whodunnit'/murder-mystery type of stories, I highly recommend this movie! Most memorable characters for me has got to be Sidney Wang and his number 3 adopted son, Willie. The others are awesome characters but somehow Sidney Wang and his son shines more for me. The dialogues are funny and great, and the plots are very interesting albeit a little confusing at times as too much things going on at the same time.

~*~THE DVD~*~

The DVD has only and interview with Neil Simon, the creator of the movie, actors biography, and 2 trailers for the movie and the other movie by Neil called 'The Cheap Detective'.

Not much, but the interview with the creator was interesting enough, and it's better than nothing.",1307923200,,1623,5.299610894941634
520118,5,6302797535,This is definitely one of my all time favorite movies.  A true classic whodunit.  Great cast.  Great acting.  Great story.  Glad I own it.  Love watching it with friends who haven't seen it.  Definitely one of my favorites to share.,1304380800,,232,4.65
520119,4,6302797535,"Murder by Death is a nice sendup for those fans who relish detective novels. Based on Neil Simon's screenplay, the film utilizes well-timed wit and spoof to entertain. Although nonsensical at points, much of the film's power resonates in its ""who done it"" murder mystery approach and mood, and has a wonderful cast and great humor throughout. It is not a film to bash for seeming silly and preposterous mainly because it embraces the nonsense with good fun. While watching, I was reminded often of the 1985 film Clue, a spinoff of the popular detective board game, in which we meet various characters of the game who try to solve the murder at the film's beginning.

In Murder By Death, Mr. Lionel Twain (played by Truman Capote) has given invitations to a select and elite group of literary sleuths (Agatha Christie, Perriot, Sam Shade among others)  and his proposition is quite unusual: they will meet, dine and then solve a murder that will take place AFTER they arrive. The best of  the detective business arrive one by one to the estate of Lionel Twain, but seem to be puzzled as to the motive of bring all together. They arrive, and Twain makes an auspicious entrance, and then boasts to giving one million dollars to the one who can solve the crime that will happen at exactly midnight. When the murder takes place, motives abound, and no one is quite sure who to trust. They do all this in a slapstick, silly sort of way as we try to follow along and solve the mystery. Great dialogue and witty lines make this worth some of the mistakes. I thought Peter Falk did an exceptional job as Spade, too!

The ending to the film might have been thought out better, but still, it is a great dinner movie, and one that fans of the murder literary world will appreciate. There is a short interview with Neil Simon, but I wasn't that impressed with it. Over all, still, a nice addition  to the DVD library.",1298246400,,1904,4.555555555555555
520120,5,6302797535,I used to watch this movie as a kid.  Decided to buy it as an adult.  Very silly and funny.  Worth the purchase.,1296604800,,112,3.782608695652174
520121,3,6302797535,"I have to admit that with an all-star cast of actors and actresses I expected a fantastic movie.  Unfortunately, while the acting was amazing, the incredibly stupid story just ruined the movie for me.

Story - Five world-class detectives have been invited to a mansion to solve a murder.  The catch?  The murder hasn't happened yet.  Each of the detectives brings along a partner with which they have somewhat of a relationship with.  Once they arrive at the mansion, chaos ensues and the comedy quickly sets in.  Unfortunately, due to how the story is written, everything that happens intentionally confusing.  Scenes contradict each other, pointless scenes are added, and although it's supposed to be hilarious, it ends up looking sloppy.  The ending (without giving anything away) is incredibly disappointing, especially after there is so much build-up to it.

Acting - However, I must say, that though the story can be crazy at times, the acting is top notch all the way through.  All of the actors/actresses portray their characters perfectly, and the characters are priceless!  Whether it's the zany Chinese detective or the wheelchair-bound nurse, they will all crack you up with their quirkiness, and they are what truly make the movie watchable.

Comedy - Where the film is funny, it is hilarious.  However, all of the jokes are not necessarily funny.  Some jokes fall flat and leave us viewers realizing how unbelievably cheesy that line was.  However, these moments can be overlooked in anticipation of the next line that will crack us up.

Bonus Features - Also included on the DVD is an interview with the creator of the movie and trailers for this movie and it's sequel (The Cheap Detective).

Overall - Overall, this movie has some lackluster comedy and a truly atrocious story.  But the fantastic acting truly saves it, as do some of the extremely comical lines.  As you can probably tell from some of the other reviews, this movie is loved by many reviewers here on Amazon, so if you want to give it a watch or two, you might enjoy it more than I did.  But I honestly have to say that I recommend choosing another movie over this one.",1293840000,9,2151,4.8224043715847

520123,5,6302797535,"I was rather young when I first saw this film, probably around 12 or so. My best friend and I were always watching movies on weekends, usually B horror films and slapstick comedies that were broadcast in the afternoons. We stumbled onto this one, and it's been a lifelong memory of ours. The insanity of it, the over-the-top characters and plot left us howling and to this day we STILL quote lines from it. Truman Capote was a hoot, and Peter Falk was a riot. The whole cast was outstanding, playing off each other in the numerous utterly absurd situations. I was overjoyed when it was finally released on DVD and it made the perfect Birthday present for my friend (still my best friend after almost 30 years). This film is most certainly NOT for those interested in ""serious"" movie plots, and it has a few moments where things get a bit bogged down, but it does well at not taking itself seriously and showcases some outstanding slapstick comedy from the cast members. The parodies of well known literary sleuths are excellent, those who know who the characters are based on will get a chuckle out of seeing these madcap renditions of them.",1290556800,,1141,4.625615763546798

520129,5,6302797535,"For all the fans of crime and noir movies, here comes one of the best satire's on the whole genre. Murder by Death is by far the funniest spoof on noir/mystery genre I have seen. Paying no respect to the stalwarts of the genre and taking the piss out of all and sundry, this movie should really rank up there in the noir-parody movies of all time. Made in 1976 by Robert Moore, in what could really be made into a sweet theatrical play, this is a forgotten classic.

Lionel Twain (played by Truman Capote no less), a bored/lonely/twisted oldman invites five of the world's top most private-eyes to dinner at his country mansion. One of the detectives will be murdered right after dinner but nobody who is being picked. The murder will occur before 12.00AM, and who ever solves the murder will be payed $1 million. But Twain does not show up at the dinner, preferring to talk through a taxidermy animal head trophy stuck on the wall. He keeps dropping hints and raising allegations, while giving his announcements, as the guests have their dinner. Naturally, all the guests are agitated but since they are the best detectives in the world, they rise up to the challenge of solving the mystery of who is going to be killer. As the night progresses, we are treated to high doses of hilarious dark humor. The only maids in the mansion are the blind butler (blind, why? since he was cheap to hire) and the deaf/dumb cook. Comedy of errors and comedy of terrors ensue as we get closer to midnight. Low, the butler is murdered, and Twain disappears. The ending will have you in splits, since its easily the most ludicrous parody of events.

Some of the finest acting is provided by Peter Sellers in his role as the ""China-man"" Sidney Wang, who strives hard to construct a sentence with an article, much to the chagrin of the well-bred Twain. Sidney Wang cracked me up when ever he opened his mouth. Also special mention to Pete Falk's Sam Diamond, a no-nonsense street smart, tough guy, who loves keeping naked pictures of musclemen in his closet, don't ask me why. This is truly a mad mad movie that will have you laugh all your worries away...2 thumbs up!",1278460800,,2150,4.567357512953368

Also, there are many convoluted attempts at twists and turns, but the results offer few surprises. In the end, it's more of a high-school script than a movie.

These five detectives consist of Milo Perrier (James Coco), Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), and Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith).

The guests arrive to find themselves served by a blind butler (Alex Guinness) and a deaf/mute maid (Nancy Walker).  At dinner, their host appears and announces that someone at the table will be killed at midnight.  But preventing the murder will be hard since rooms seem to come and go at will.  As do bodies.  Can these great detectives figure out what is going on?

As a mystery lover, I have to love this movie.  And I do.  The spoofs are spot on, especially Peter Falk's Bogart impression as Sam Diamond.  Since Neil Simon wrote the screenplay, the one liners come fast and furious.  Both times I've seen this, I've been laughing hysterically multiple times.

The movie does have a couple of flaws, however.  The first are some rather racist comments and the stereotypical accent by Peter Sellers.  Of course, that is part of the spoof, so it mostly works.  The other is the ending.  The mystery fan in me cries out for something better.  But that's a minor complaint.  There are parts of the denouncement that are pitch perfect as a spoof.

Those who aren't familiar with the classics of the mystery genre might not find it nearly as enjoyable, but mystery fans will eat this up.",1261785600,3,1580,4.824626865671642

This film has one of my all-time favorite characters: ""Sidney Wang,"" played by Peter Sellers. The late English actor did a fabulous job of imitating Charlie Chan. He is the highlight among a very talented cast that includes Peter Falk, David Niven, James Coco, Elsa Lanchester, Alec Guinesses, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker and Truman Capote.

Today, the character oddest for me to view is a young James Cromwell who speaks with a French accent! I've never seen him in any role remotely resembling this. The other actors play roles typical of them, such as Niven and Smith's dapper ""Thin Man"" couple and Falk's, Columbo/Mike Hammer-style American detective.

This spoof of  great fictional writers and detectives  has a purposely exaggerated amount of twists, particularly at the end. Entertainment-wise, start-to-finish it is fun with absolutely no lulls. It's a classic!",1237939200,,1087,5.011111111111111

Poirot, Marple, Chan, Spade, and the Charles' (Thin Man series) are all lampooned by a (pardon my caps) ALL-STAR CAST that is amazing by any standard.  It's hard to say which performer was having the most fun.  I'd give it five stars, but I recognize that the subject may have limited appeal for younger audiences who would have a hard time anchoring the farcical characters to their famous literary forebears.  The writing is a hoot with many laugh-out-loud moments, but I think I enjoy it more because I appreciate the satire and not just the sight gags.  Honestly, I put this one on my short list of lesser-known gems.  How wonderful that it's still available for purchase.

The plot centers around a dinner party hosted by an eccentric (aren't they all) mystery host who plans stage a murder so that he can outsmart the world's greatest detectives.  The guest list includes (in alphabetical order) Eileen Brennan (Tess Skeffington), Truman Capote (Lionel Twain), James Coco (Milo Perrier), James Cromwell (Marcel), Peter Falk (Sam Diamond), Alec Guinness (Bensonmum), Elsa Lanchester (Jessica Marbles),  Richard Narita (Willie Wang), David Niven (Dick Charleston), Peter Sellers (Sidney Wang), Maggie Smith (Dora Charleston), Nancy Walker (Maid), and Estelle Winwood (Nurse).

This sardonic black comedy begins when the best five detectives of the world are invited apparently for a dinner by an eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) with just a purpose: to demonstrate to all of them he is the number one; announcing that exactly at midnight there will be  murder.

But the entire script is filled of funny and smart observations. Peter Sellers play the role of Wang - steals the show-  (the famous detective) , Alec Guinness is the blind butler, Peter Falk is absorbing as the vulgar Sam Diamond (in a visible parody of Bogart in Casablanca), David Niven (Dick Charleston) and Maggie Smith make a real tour de force with this intelligent satire in which we will watch to Wang, Sherlock Holmes, Columbus, Hercules Poirot, and Mrs. Marble.

OK, so it is not the plot or the inherently stagey nature of the movie that is classic - but the mixing of such a fine ensemble cast. A brilliant cast play similes of literatures great detectives - Peter Falk playing Bogart's Sam Spade crossed with Columbo (Sam Diamond in the movie), David Niven playing The Thin Man, Peter Sellers playing Charlie Chan (Wang in the movie), and Agatha Christies Poirot and Marples give rise to the hysterically monikered Milo Perrier and Miss Marbles. Add to that the iconic Truman Capote as the millionaire, and Alec Guinness as the blind butler as well as various sidekicks, and you have possibly the biggest set of scenery chewers crammed into one dining room.

The jokes are thick and fast, always farcical, but never straying too far into slapstick. Any misses are quickly forgiven as the next joke comes along.

Predictably perhaps the ending is not entirely satisfactory - a simple but clever ending would have been more effective than the over elaborate series of revelations which don't quite tie up. But lets face it, when you're having this much fun, who cares.

520204,4,6302797535,"For a time during the 1970s writer Neil Simon was so hot that his name alone was enough to ensure box office success--and one of the results of that fame was MURDER BY DEATH, a parody of murder mysteries of earlier decades.

The concept is quite clever, bringing together celebrated detectives of fiction and film: Dick and Dora Charleston (based on Nick and Nora Charles of the celebrated THIN MAN films); Milo Perrier and Jessica Marbles (Hercules Poriot and Jane Marple of Agatha Christie's celebrated novels); Sidney Wang and son Willie (Charlie Chan and son of the fondly remembered film series); and Sam Diamond (Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON.)  Each has been invited for an overnight party at the home of the eccentric Lionel Twain--but upon arrival their hosts seals the mansion and informs them that a vicious murder will occur at midnight.  Can the world's greatest detectives solve their way out of this one?

The casting is inspired, particularly so re Lionel Twain, who is played by Truman Capote, an individual every bit as eccentric as the character he plays.  David Niven and Maggie Smith do the honors as Dick and Dora; James Coco and the ever-memorable Elsa Lanchester appear as Perrier and Miss Marbles; Peter Sellers dons Asian attire for Inspector Wang; and Peter Faulk runs wild as tough-talking Sam Diamond.  Alec Guiness, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennar, and Estelle Winwood also offer memorable support.  The dialogue is quite clever, referencing the various source material of the characters, and is quite often laugh-out-loud funny in its absurdity.

What is not particularly interesting is the plot.  After a certain point the film becomes distinctly one-note, and to describe the conclusion as unfortunate would be an understatement; indeed, it would be difficult to say that the film has any conclusion at all.  Even so, the performers make it a fun affair, and it will particularly appeal to murder mystery fans who recall the original characters fondly.  The DVD offers a choice of pan-and-scan or widescreen, trivial notes, and more interestingly a brief interview with Simon himself.  Don't expect too much of it and you'll enjoy it quite a bit.

The direction, by a theater director who seems to understand nothing about film, is flat and awkward. It's as if everyone, including the wonderful (and wasted) cast, conspired to snuff what little comedic potential there may have been in the script. As a supposed satire of mystery novels, the film is obliged to be more clever than the average novel it parodies, yet there is nothing remotely clever about the plot (if it can be said to have a plot), and makes no sense whatsoever, on any level.

There are some off-colored remarks, and it certainly is not a ""PC"" film, but that is what it's all about. This is an all-star cast. I highly recommend this film, especially if you are a little older. Someone in there 20's may not appreciate this film as much as someone in the their mid 30's. No special effects, no nudity (well, one scene, I guess, but nothing anyone would really be interested in, and certainly nothing gratuitus), no real violence, and nothing really meant for shock value.

We have David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Nora Charleston, the glamorous duo; Peter Falk as Columbo playing Sam Diamond, who as always is fine; Eileen Brennan is his sexy assistant and girlfriend; the inimitable Peter Sellers is Wang, the oriental sleuth; Elsa Lanchester plays Miss Marbles and James Coco is Frenchy Perrier, who is very funny too.  The supporting cast is effectively rounded out by Estelle Winwood as Marbles' invalid nurse; Nancy Walker as the deaf and dumb cook; James Cromwell as Perriers fussy valet, Richard Narita as Wang's adopted Japanese son, and the scene stealing Alec Guinness as the blind butler.

520229,3,6302797535,"A decent dinner murder mystery, Murder By Death, brings to the screen the story of a wealthy and eccentric man who invites the five most well known private investigators to his mansion in order to test/challenge their reputation.

The cast carries out their performances well enough, the only exception being Peter Sellers who is not that convincing in his role as a Chinese (!) detective.

On the positive side:

1) Dinner murder mysteries and mysteries in general are fun to watch.

2) Maggie Smith looks gorgeous in the 70's!

3) It was interesting to see who this Truman Capote was.

On the negative side:

1) Capote was really nothing great.

2) The acting and the dialogues could have been much better.

3) The ending was very weak/silly; a big disappointment indeed.

Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment!

For a wonderful mystery I would recommend Clue, the Movie, starring Tim Curry, not to mention the classic Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes MASTERPIECES.",1145404800,7,1047,4.959770114942529

The story is that the five most brilliant detectives from around the world are invited to dinner by an eccenric millionaire Lionel Tait to solve a murder that has not happended yet.  Each of the guests have some connection to their host and a reason to murder.  But theirs also a reason to solve the case - 1 million dollars (in 1976 that WAS a lot of money).  This film makes a mockey and comedy of the events that transpire as the guests attempt to solve the murder.  Sellers and Capote show off their brilliance and the jokes, though sometimes a bit stupid are funny.  This film is way beeter than clue and far funnier than the recent Pink Panther.  If you are looking for something funny that is classic and safe for the family this is a sure fire hit.

Enjoy this.

It's seldom that a movie comes along this hillarious that makes one really think about who done it.  The premise, an eccentric millionaire (Truman Capote)with a bone to pick, invites the worlds five greatest living detectives to dinner and a murder.  Wang (Peter Sellers),Marbles (Elsa Lanchester),Pierre (James Coco), Charleston (David Niven) and Diamond (Peter Falk) are locked in Twain's (Capote) mansion, filled with mysteriously moving rooms, a blind butler (Alec Guiness) and a deaf and mute maid (Nancy Walker).  A ""murder"" is committed and the detectives each render a who done it.  But who really did what?

Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith and James Cromwell also appear and together with the detectives, deliver the most hillarious lines and observations.  The plot defintely deserves a nod and I couldn't be happier with the DVD presentation.

He tells the group that a murder will occur at midnight with a million dollars going to the first person to identify the culprit.  ""Murder by Death"" gently pokes fun at seemingly every mystery movie convention - the eccentric butler, a mansion engulfed in fog and rain, a cut phone wire, and an appropriately convoluted, silly ending.  Because the humor is so good-spirited, even fans of the originals are likely to laugh.  The fast pace also helps keep things on track.  In addition, the acting talent is top-notch, with a who's who of 70s film: Alec Guinness, David Niven, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Peter Falk, and Eileen Brennan.

I revisited it on DVD recently for the first time since then and my enthusiasm for it has waned some. It's still a very funny picture. Most of the jokes are hit or miss, but there's enough there to justify a recommendation. Peter Falk and Peter Sellers are the standouts in a uniformly good comic cast. I certainly like this infinitely better than the more ""serious"" comedies Neil Simon wrote for Marsha Mason (""Goodbye Girl"", please!).",1091664000,16,611,4.464285714285714
520262,4,6302797535,"Despite the (mostly) excellent cast this movie production of Neil Simon's play leaves a little to be desired.  In particular I think that director Robert Moore needed to work harder toward getting the timing of his players down pat and focusing the jokes.  I also think it was a mistake to cast Truman Capote in the role of Lionel Twain, the eccentric millionaire who invites the five world famous detectives to his estate with the idea of matching murderous wits with them and fooling them.  Although he looks the part, Capote stands out like a sore thumb amidst the much more experienced and talented cast, so much so that I almost felt sorry for him.  He pronounces his lines competently but with neither flair nor finesse.
The premise of the play reveals Neil Simon's satirical intent: the characters are all caricatures of famous fictional detectives: Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers ) as a Charlie Chan type; Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) as a Sam Spade type; Inspector Milo Perrier (James Coco) as a famous Belgique detective of similar name (Agatha Christie's Poirot) who could also be Georges Simenon's famous French detective (except that he cries out, ""Not Frenchie--Belgie!"").  The absurd plot begins as the detectives motor toward Twain's haunted, fog-shrouded castle in northern California for a dinner that is never served.  Everything is played as a farce (""farce --n. 1. a comedy based on unlikely situations and exaggerated effects."" --Random House College Dictionary) and everybody tries to ham it up.  I particularly liked Peter Sellers as the Chinese Wang with his #3 adopted Japanese son in tow.  Alec Guinness plays the blind butler (""The butler did it!"") while Nancy Walker has a small part as the blind and deaf cook.  David Niven is mildly amusing as the debonaire Dick Charleston who, unbeknownst to his wife (Maggie Smith), has only a buck-seventy-some in his tuxedo pocket (and some stamps) after going through some of her millions.
Representative joke:  When asked by his #3 adopted Japanese son why HE has to clean up the dead body, Inspector Wang tells him, ""Because your mother isn't here.""  By the way, the makeup on Peter Sellers (""Inspector Slanty,"" according to Sam Diamond) is especially well done.  As usual Peter Sellers manages to look more like the character he playing than himself, so much so that one needs to do a double take to realize it is Peter Sellers at work.
One of the problems with a movie like this is that all the actors are trying to upstage one another and every line and pratfall is played as MY moment in the spotlight so there is little contrast around which to frame the best bits.  Still, afficionados, especially those viewing this repeatedly, will find plenty to crack up about.
See this for Neil Simon, one of America's most popular playwrights, whose semi-sophisticated, upbeat comedies delighted theater and movie audiences for several decades beginning in the Sixties.  I particularly loved The Out-of-Towners (1970) with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis; The Good-bye Girl (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason; and the unforgettable The Odd Couple (1968) starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.  Simon and Peter Falk followed this up with The Cheap Detective (1978).  Incidentally, Falk's work here and in The Cheap Detective and in a couple of earlier Columbo movies served as a proving ground for his long-running TV hit Columbo.",1089676800,21,3408,5.005309734513275

My sister and I have watched it at least 30 times if not a lot more, and just this past weekend while I was visiting her in Ithaca, she picked up on another laugh line that we'd never even noticed!
The movie seems a bit dry at first, and would probably be a better fit as a stage play; a hilarious one at that.  The movie is a spoof on Agatha Christi's ""And Then There Were None,"" and has characters who are spoofs of other TV detectives; i.e., instead of Nick and Nora Charleston, it's Dick and Dora Charleston.

Five famous detectives from the literary world are spoofed when they and their partners are invited to a mysterious mansion to witness a murder and a million dollars is offered to whomever can solve the case.

Written by Neil Simon (The Odd Couple, California Suite), this film has tons of great lines and truly wonderful performances by all the actors.  There's Dick and Dora Charleston played by David Niven and Maggie Smith, Inspector Milo Perrier (I'm not a Frenchie!  I'm a Belgie!) played by James Coco and his secretary/chauffeur Marcel (James Cromwell), Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Manchester, probably most famous for her role as the Bride of Frankenstein) and her nurse, Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers) and his number 3 adopted Japanese son Willie, and finally Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) and his secretary Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan).  Rounding out the cast is Alec Guinness, playing the blind butler, Truman Capote as the eccentric host Lionel Twain, and Nancy Walker as the deaf and mute maid, Yetta.

Peter Sellers has always been one of my favorite comedic actors, and he certainly shines here, but, in my opinion, Peter Falk edges him out here.  His comic imitation of Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade is dead on.  All the actors perform wonderfully, but watch for Alec Guinness as Jamesir Bensonmum, Lionel Twain's blind Butler.  Alec Guinness is best know for his serious roles, but he did a number of very funny comedies earlier in his career, including such films as The Lavender Hill Mob, The Man in the White Suit, and Kind Hearts and Coronets.

As the clues present themselves, the speculation flies.  The pacing of the film is kept brisk throughout, with snappy dialogue and excellent characterizations as Simon truly keeps the viewer engaged with a great script.  The direction by Robert Moore is wonderful, keeping things from getting confusing and allowing all members of this ensemble cast to enjoy enough screen time for us to appreciate the characters.  Credit must also be given to the creators of the sets, as they add so much to the overall feel of the movie.

Not a lot in the way of extras, but the picture looks great and is available in both wide screen and full screen formats.  I am going to end this review with one of my favorite lines from the movie, spoken by Peter Falk playing Sam Diamond  ""My hat's off to the man with the shiv in his back. Except for the fact that he's dead, he was no dope.""

520299,4,6302797535,"""...Neither did I.""
I'll start with the obvious--'Murder by Death' is hilarious. Which can be credited, no doubt, to Neil Simon. My first exposure to Simon was the tremendously funny `Prisoner of Second Avenue', in which a husband and wife swap quips over which one of them was responsible for letting their place be burglarized. After reading that Simon had written the script, I knew that I had to see this. Add to that the fact that I've loved mysteries all my life, was raised on them, in fact, since infancy, and it's no wonder that I had high hopes.
Simon didn't let me down and neither did the ensemble cast. I could tell you about the tremendous one liners, as I had read about them before viewing the film myself, but really you must hear the way the actors throw them out. If the ones recited by the reviewers here make you chuckle, I can almost guarantee that you will be holding your stomach and wiping your eyes when you actually watch the movie. It's delightful, truly! I just know I'll be going around for days with some of the lines on my tongue, waiting for an excuse to use them.
If you liked `Clue', as many others have mentioned, you must watch, no, own, `Murder by Death.' It's one of those movies that invites you to set a date and watch it every year with a small group of friends.",1033689600,2,1304,4.392561983471074

I think the whole movie is very well done: the acting is flawless, the writing, the setting (wonderful!), the mood (even more wonderful!).
If you're into creepy old mansions and rainy nights and hilarious one-liners, you'll have a ball. Enjoy!

Murder By Death, release by Columbia Pictures in 1976 proved to be one of the most twisted, bizzare mystery films of that time.  The most hilarious of the roles was, of course, Inspector Wang, played by Peter Sellers.  Then you have Alec Guiness, playing ""The Blind Butler"" even before he was Obi Won Kenobi in 1977.  Truman Capote proved once more to be as feminine in his movies as he always was in real life. And even the ""Deaf Maid"" continued to use ""Bounty"" even after this movie.  So, the more you start to recognize the actors and actresses of this movie, who were not as yet popular, with the xception of Peter Faulk, who had already been playing ""Columbo"" at the time, this film is definately one for the history books!",1018051200,,852,4.5359477124183005

Now, about that missing scene:  I don't know about the DVD version, I haven't seen it, but as far as the video goes, it is missing a great scene at the end where all the detectives are leaving the Twain mansion.  In this scene, Wang's car is in the front, and stops at another car approaching from the other direction.  This car has none other than Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in a cameo!  Watson asks for directions to Twain's mansion, which Wang gives him.  Adopted son Willie asks ""Gee pop, why didn't you tell him it was a rip off?""  Wang responds with a grin: ""Let idiots find out for themselves.""  This scene was included on the TV broadcast version from maybe 20 years ago or so (bad print but the scene is included).  Why it is deleted from the video is a mystery to me and is unfortunate for fellow fans of this movie.",1015632000,,1103,4.336585365853659

Smart and silly at the same time and I admit its probably not the best comedy to watch with a large group, but that's mainly because most of the comedy is verbal. The dialogue is snappy and is best watched without distraction (at least the first time).

520320,5,6302797535,"I remember watching this movie as a child and it absolutly terrified me.  The dark setting; the maid who was unable to speak or hear; the murders; these were all so much for a young girl to handle.  However, when I was away at college and since we were unable to afford cable my roommates and I would occasionally buy videos and watch them over and over and over... When I found a copy of Murder By Death for sale I thought of this as an opportunity to overcome the scarring this film had left me with as a child.  We went home and popped the video in the VCR and for the next 94 minutes we laughed until we cried.  I absolutly loved this movie!
The casting was excellent!  I couldn't imagine anyone else but those incredibly talented actors/actresses playing the richly developed characters.  The setting was well done and the script is hilarious!!!  By today's standards some of the jokes/lines can be considered to be very politically incorrect and the idea of a caucasian (Sellers)portraying an Asian would probably receive much protest.  But considering the time the film was made this is not an issue for me personally (I'm part Asian). The set is beautiful and yet haunting and the costuming is wonderful.  I dream of having a beautiful dress like the one worn by Dora Charleston (portrayed by the incredibly talented Maggie Smith).
I can honestly say that I watch this movie at least once a week and I know this film so well I can almost follow the dialogue line by line when watching it.  I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD and I appreciate all of the little extras found on the DVD but I really would have enjoyed a Dirctor's Commentary to follow along with the movie.

While it is true that the ending is confusing, and the plot may not be all that original or make any sense, what makes this movie great is the almost constant string of one-liners delivered perfectly by the all-star cast.  Much has been made (rightly so) of the phenomenal performances of Maggie Smith, David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Peter Falk, but in my opinion the greatest movie moment comes from the octogenarian Estelle Winwood (incidentally, Tallulah Bankhead's lover) when something is revealed about Miss Marbles and Lionel Twain.

To those who simply don't know who Charlie Chan or Truman Capote are (or the other characters), well, it may seem over the top.
My one main complaint is WHY did the DVD (and the VHS) cut one of the funniest scenes at the end of the movie when Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson show up late for the party/murder???  It would be interesting to know the reason for the deletion as the scene was certainly worth keeping intact within the ending of the movie.",1013731200,,728,4.291970802919708

There are also quite a few extras on the disc that make it worthwhile if you already have the tape.
The basic plotline is fairly simple - the worlds greatest detectives have been invited to the house of Lionel Twain for dinner and a murder.  Several of literature's most beloved detectives are gently skewered for our enjoyment (like Miss Jessica Marbles and Mr. Perrier).  During the course of the night almost every plot hole that has ever existed in a dime novel thriller or bad 1940's moviei exploited hilariously.

I saw this film in high school, a private school where I  think the teaching clergy believed this film to be rated G.

Spoofing everyone from Miss Marple to Sam Spade, Charlie Chan to The Thin Man, and everyone in between, Neil Simon's script (outdoing such Simon  classics as ""The Odd Couple"") is so far out there that one can  only fall in love with this movie.
Being a big fan of mysteries,  parodies, and all-star casts, this was the movie for me.  The whole cast  has a ball and hams it up to High Heaven.  I love David Niven and Maggie  Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston.  Smith especially soars, giving an  offhanded, almost nonchalant performance that leaves you rolling in the  aisles.  Elsa Lanchester is great as Jessica Marbles, and Estelle Winwood,  in a very small role, gets a few good lines as her senile nurse.  (Watch  for their entrance!)  James Coco is a comic riot as the always-hungry  Monsieur Perrier.  Peter Sellers is classic again as Inspector Wang (with  every line funnier than the last).  He has more proverbs than all the  fortune cookies in Chinatown: ""Treacherous road like-a fresh  mushroom...""  Peter Falk is insane as really-not-quite-there Sam  Diamond, and Truman Capote gets in a fun cameo appearance as their puckish  host, Lionel Twain.  Smith, Coco, Sellers, and Falk shine.  But two of the  best performances are in rather small roles played by a pre-""Star  Wars"" Sir Alec Guiness (so don't expect to hear the Force theme on his  entrance) showing his comedic talent as the blind butler, Bensonmum, and  ""Rhoda"" alum, the great Nancy Walker, as the deaf-and-dumb cook,  Yetta.  These two have some of the funniest scenes in film history, each  playing marvelously off the other's shortcomings.  (Watch for when  Bensonmun ""fires"" her--even holding the door open and pointing  out--while she looks on, bewildered!)
The classic lines are everywhere.  Falk: ""I gotta go to da can.  Sometimes I talk so much, I forget ta  go.""  Lanchester: ""Pardon my language, but it scared the ca-ca  out of me!"" Smith: (in response) ""You know, Dicky, I like her.  I  really like her.""  Capote: (chastising Sellers' broken English)  ""IT!  IT!  Use your damn pronouns!""  Perrier's driver: (About a  chocolate bar with almonds instead of nuts) ""The man at the store had  no nuts."" Coco: (responding) ""He was short?""  Sellers:  ""Look! Voice come from cow on wall!""  But the best line in the  whole movie is when the butler has been gone for quite some time and not  returned with their meal, and starving Coco, in detective mode, says,  ""The most important question is: Where is the butler?  And why has he  not returned...(Screaming dramatically)...WITH OUR DINNER! ""
I was  in a murder-mystery play last year in which one character was a sendup of  Truman Capote; I loaned this video to the actor who had that part.  And  this week, I'm playing a role in Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little  Indians,"" in which Estelle Winwood (Ms. Marbles' nurse in this film)  originated the stage role of Emily Brent in 1944.

My only  disappointment, perhaps shared by anyone who's seen this in theaters, is  the video version ending.  In the theatrical release of this movie, there  was a funny scene at the end, which is not in the video release.

When they leave, his adopted son asks,  ""Pop.  Why didn't you tell them the whole thing's a sham?"" (or  something like that) then Wang laughs and says, ""Let them figure it  out for themselves.""
