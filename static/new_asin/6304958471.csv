943357,5,6304958471,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone Are two of the greatest visionaries of our time. This is by far the best movie I have ever watched. It is low budget, yet, it loses nothing. I could watch this movie everyday if I wasn't busy dealing in the White Slave Ring. An occupation that keeps me on the road frequently. Please any man desperate for a sex slave or a nice quite night at home; give this movie a look.  Believe me when I say it is a classic in the making.",985392000,,453,4.033333333333333
943358,3,6304958471,"What everyone says is true - these are the episodes, no extras, yadda yadda. I don't really want to submit a numerical review... I think anyone who's interested in this knows what the content is. This is a more technical review, for people who care about that sort of thing.
Be aware that the quality of the video transfer is quite low. I'm very surprised to see other people's reviews saying the transfer is good or excellent.
Digital artifacts are visible around anything that moves. There is a strange bluriness that pulses through the picture regularly, that comes and goes. Also, perhaps most annoying, there is very severe dot crawl encoded on the DVD! Were these DVD's transferred from a VHS tape? With the highly contrasting colours of the animation style, there are large amounts of dot crawl.... I thought it may have been my system, but pause the playback, and the dots stop moving... and watch them crawl, frame by frame.
The colours, which should be solid and pure, are instead swarms of constantly moving pixels. Very annoying. The blurriness and swarminess of the colours make it look like a VHS recording.
The movie - Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, is an absolutely flawless, beautiful picture. It's a shame that they couldn't have rerendered these episodes from the source. Weren't they all generated digitally to begin with?",985132800,6,1338,4.898678414096916
943359,3,6304958471,"These three volumes of South Park are structurally identical to all six volumes that have been released so far, and suffer from the same shortcomings.  One glaring flaw is that none of the episodes are sub-titled, so if you are hearing impaired, you're out of luck.
I don't find these episodes as funny as the first time I watched them.  A lot of the humor of South Park is in shock value, and that has worn off.  But even so, I find them funny enough to be worth watching every now and then.  If you are a hard core fan, I recommend all three volumes on DVD.  If you are just a casual fan, your money would be better spent elsewhere.
There are no extras on any of these DVDs worth mentioning.  What's worse, there are no extras of any kind included with the 3-pack.  You just get the three DVDs with a strip of paper holding them together.  So be careful to check the individual prices of these DVDs before buying the 3-pack; it might make more sense to buy them separately.
The primary advantage of the DVDs over the VHS versions is random access to the episodes.  You also get Matt and Trey introducing the episodes, which is fairly amusing.  However, the lack of substantive extras is very disappointing.  Also, the menus are static and silent; the power of the DVD medium has been completely ignored.  This is why I only give this set 3 stars.
Some have complained that you can't skip the introductions, but I have no problem fast forwarding through them with my DVD player.  Many have also complained about the three worthless items appearing at the end of each episode (the Braniff logo, Comedy Central logo, and FBI warnings).  But simply pressing the ""menu"" button on your DVD's remote is all that is required to skip these items.  I don't like this rubbish either, but the people who whine on incessantly about this are making a mountain out of a molehill.
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!

7879999,4,6304958471,"South Park debuted on Comedy Central in 1997, and as with just about every popular TV show, episodes were eventually made available in a home video format. DVD players had become commercially available in the late 1990s, but the overwhelmingly popular video medium was still VHS cassette.  Of course, entire seasons were too big and expensive for most people to get in those days, so as with most TV shows, collections of episodes were released in separate volumes.  This ""gift pack"" includes the first three VHS releases, bundled together.  Each volume is about an hour long, namely two episodes plus some additional mock interview footage and introductions with creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  Volume 1 has ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"" and ""Volcano"".  Volume 2 has ""Weight Gain 4000"" and ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"". Volume 3 has ""An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig"" and ""Death"".  In total you have the very first six episodes of South Park. DVD versions were also released around this time, though with one or two more episodes per volume.

Reading some of these other reviews, I really can't believe so many people stupidly thought these were SEASONS #1 through #3.  Anybody who thinks an entire season could fit on a single VHS tape has obviously never owned a VCR.  The title is not ""misleading""; some people just don't read!

The main reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is, well, we're talking about a VHS set and I'm writing this review in the year 2017.  The episodes are still excellent and these tapes were great to have back in the day.  But unless you're a die-hard collector of have some strange fascination with VHS, there's no reason to get these when you can just buy ""South Park: The Complete First Season"" on DVD.  The DVD set includes all of the material in this set, plus more episodes, bonus materials, and not to mention the superior DVD quality.  Also, having only 2 episodes per tape when they could have fit 3 or more seemed like a bit of a rip-off at the time.",1501459200,,2004,4.624293785310734
