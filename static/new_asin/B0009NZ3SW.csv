2306760,2,B0009NZ3SW,"If you are familiar with Shaw Brothers, then you know that this is not your first choice of their films.  First, to it's credit (or more specifically to the credit of Dragon Dynasty) the film is restored really well and has a great picture.

What I don't like is that nearly every fight scene, of which there are many, are implied martial arts.  It is edited in such a way that you really don't see a whole lot of action.  What you do see is simple, and disapointing.  The story is decent for a kung-fu film, but compared to other Shaw Brothers classics, especially their earlier releases, this leaves much to be desired.

If you are looking for some great martial arts, this is probably not a good choice.",1214956800,10,706,4.434108527131783

The 27th film to be released by Dragon Dynasty and their 6 Shaw Brothers release, you can't go wrong with this one. Widely considered to be one of the best Hong Kong films ever made, one can see why. It carries a great story along with awesome fight scenes and fantastic acting by Cheng Pei-Pei(commentary included with her and Bey Logan) and Yueh Hua.

Special Features include:
Feature Commentary with Bey Lognan/Cheng Pei Pei
King and I-Director Tsui Hark reflections on film

2306763,4,B0009NZ3SW,"One of the first; a good core chinese martial arts movie to have in your collection. Not ruined with the stupid English dubbing that was so prevalent in the 1970's nor including the comic relief (ie. idiot chinese moron) that is not only insulting and embarrassing to the audience, but also just breaks the tempo or momentum of many action movies.",1171584000,3,347,4.704918032786885
2306764,1,B0009NZ3SW,"Well, the only star given to this early martial arts masterpiece concerns only its value as one of the firts high production kung fu movies, for it`s artistic vision and great action sequences. Back in 1968 this film was widely consider one of the first action kung fu movies, moving forward from pekin opera.
Now, speaking of the edition of this dvd, if i can call this a dvd, let`s go for parts: first this is NOT a dvd, it`s an INTERNET VCD DOWNLOAD, edited with scene selection. As we all know, besides lousy picture and sound quality, VCD format includes one or more subtitles (in this case cantonese and english) IN the picture, meaning NOT REMOVABLE.
Second, there`s blackouts every three minutes and the scene were drunken cat shows his rock breaking finger powers, is actually a complete digital mess.
If you flip the disc, the reading side is purple, typical 4.7 GB dvd disc with picture logo. OK, asian editions are bad, but at least they`re originals. Some new york company manufactured this discs, and for some reason they `re selling them as DVDs.
So, There`s a warning: STAY AWAY FROM THIS EDITION!!!",1158364800,30,1115,4.723076923076923
2306765,2,B0009NZ3SW,"I am not giving the movie 2 stars, in my opinon it is required viewing for anyone interested in kung fu/wuxia cinema. This movie was groundbreaking for its time, and it was a lot of fun to see the many inspirations for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the film.  It was also fun to see Chang Pei Pei (the villian of CTHD) in her early years. She and Angela Mao broke ground for future Hong Kong women warriors such as Michelle Yeoh. Now, as for the DVD itself...HORRIBLE.  It is of such low quality that it wouldn't play on ANY player without skipping at least a little bit.  The transfer looks horrible, it made what I am sure is a beautiful looking film look like I filmed it on a camera phone. And the worst offense, for about 20 minutes in the middle of the film you can't see the subtitles! They just drop off the screen! Well, not ALL of them, you can still read the tops of the letters!!! Somehow this is repaired before the film ends so the movie wasn't totally ruined. The day someone wants releases this movie in a even average quality DVD, BUY IT, WATCH IT, LOVE IT! Till then, I am sorry to say, don't bother with this horrible DVD.",1155772800,28,1145,4.267281105990784

2306767,5,B0009NZ3SW,"That is what the wonderful Chang Pei-Pei told her interviewer, many years later, in the DVDs bonus features. Excellent new DVD transfer (as of 2016), showing off the impressive original color photography and the riveting instrumental music that punctuates the action, suggesting, at times, the rhapsodic, and at times the energetic action-full passages in Peking Opera.
The style of this martial-arts movie is 'Wuxia', where the fighting is mainly done with swords, daggers and other blade weapons. The choice of period: the dark late days of the Ming dynasty, in the Fifteenth century, when freedom was harshly suppressed, and the chosen theme of heroes' flight to freedom, is seen by many as a metaphor for the perhaps even darker days of Mao and his then unfolding Cultural Revolution, days that were also those of an iron-fisted government in Taiwan, where King Hu filmed several movies after this one.
This is a Superheroes movie made before there were superheroes movies. And an important martial-arts movie, years before Enter the Dragon.
Jackie Chan is in this movie, still a boy, playing a very small part as one more in a group of boys that accompany the Drunken Master and sing with him for their supper.
Yue Hua is the Drunken Master, known to many as Drunken Cat. He drinks and he fights with equal dedication and panache. And a young Pei-Pei is the Fine Lady You Better Dont Mess Around With.
This actress not only could move as quickly as a monkey, jump as a gazelle, and pretend-fight as a deadly panther: she could also act. Many years later, towards the end of a long and distinguished career, she played the evil witch Jade Fox in the justly acclaimed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
And there is a great supporting cast of bandits, soldiers (including a company of fancily dressed women soldiers) and two magnificent super villains: the cruel and sinister head bandit Man in White, his lieutenant Smiley Face, and the Evil Abbot (who is both Drunken Cats brother and his deadly enemy).
The best way I can describe this movie to you: it is a martial-arts-revenge movie, made decades before Quentin Tarantinos Kill Bill 1 and 2, that is almost (but also more than) an excuse for a fantastic display of the degree of coordination the human body is capable of by itself as well as in a group of bodies moving in nearly perfect harmony.
In other words: it is an occasion to admire poetry in motion, of which there is plenty. And it is a lot of fun to watch, as well.
This movie is a great example of the art of King Hu, its director.
The story has been already outlined by other reviewers. All that is left for me to do now is to express my admiration for this little jewel, made in Hong-Kong in 1966, with a small budget but with a very big heart, and recommend it to you with all of mine.",1475798400,,2805,4.634538152610442

Ok that's what you wanted to know.  Here are my thoughts on the movie.  The sets and the story lines were just so-so.  But that's not the reason we buy these films,  I really enjoyed the action sequences.  I noticed one they must have done in slow motion and then tried to speed the camera up.  If they had done it just a tick faster it would have been fantastic.  But overall very enjoyable action.",1473206400,,1011,4.934523809523809

I've been watching martial art films since the 70's and this is hands down a classic, you can see how it laid the path for productions today. The quality of the transfer to DVD is fine no complaints from me, I actually like the slight dated look, it time stamps it as not some new reboot. So to the reviewers dogging this movie, grow up and learn to appreciate early works like this because there are bad ones from this era but Come Drink With Me isn't one of them.",1455235200,2,606,4.419642857142857

2306791,5,B0009NZ3SW,"I REALLY like how this DVD is compiled. The picture quality is a bit lacking because it has not yet been digitally remastered, but that is not necessary to enjoy all the complexities in this one-of-a-kind production.  There are precious interviews including those with the main stars, Ms Cheng Pei Pei and Mr Yueh Hua, both doing well as of this writing. There is also a great movie commentary featuring Ms Cheng and an expert on classic kung fu flicks.  Soooo much has been copied from this masterpiece created by Hu Jingquan (King Hu) that it is easy for today's viewers to exclaim 'So what else is new?' But once you step back and come to the realization that this was done nearly 50 years ago in pre-boom Hong Kong, within the heavily equipped studios of Run Run Shaw (23 November 1907 - 7 January 2014), with near complete creative freedom for director King Hu in this the only film he ever did for Shaw Brothers, you start to appreciate its greatness all the more.  I am sure there will be some kind of digitally remastered version coming in the future, but for now this is a very good way for the Shaw Brothers / kung fu flick affectionado, the inquisitive novice and the sometimey viewer alike to add to their collection of great cinematic masterpieces of the world. Highly recommended, very reasonably priced.",1395532800,3,1318,4.6239316239316235
2306792,3,B0009NZ3SW,"I liked the symbolism in the movie, unique to Chinese language/characters, & was excited to see strong female lead in older martial arts movie, but her martial arts seemed more like dance than martial arts.

2306800,4,B0009NZ3SW,"Yes, as some other reviews point out you will see many inspirations for scenes in modern martial arts movies based on this film.  Groundbreaking at the time, from a historical perspective this is an important movie as the focus goes from fake blood to more of a storyline.  Especially less ""over the top"" than most other Shaw Brother's films, this one is slower paced (probably King Hu's directorial influence), but there are still plenty of fight sequences for the female hero to show off her skills. Played by the legendary Pei Pei before she was a legend( and who for some reason doesn't look as old as she should be when you see her now in Crouching Tiger), it's hard to believe she has been doing this for so many years.

The first 5 minutes are weak, as is an ending that still seems a little uncomfortable with a female lead and takes the spotlight off of Pei Pei. But inbetween is top notch, and it is a lot of fun to watch where some of today's great movies have their roots.  The scene that comes after the intro is particularly well done and memorable, as she stops at a local inn/watering hole and surprises the local thugs with her cool demeanor and fast moves. I've seen it replicated now several times, including in Crouching Tiger. While Pei Pei can't compete with today's special effects, she pulls the whole thing off nicely none the less.

The bonus features of interviews are also well worth it if you enjoy this genre.  Film quality is very good all things considered. If you like older martial arts movies you can't go wrong with this DVD.  If you're only a fan of more modern ones but would like to see some history in the making it's also worth picking up as well.",1330214400,,1688,4.461038961038961
2306801,4,B0009NZ3SW,"The beautiful leading lady in this film is really the only reason why I like this film, I feel that without her this honestly would have been a 2 star movie for me. Her action scenes are pretty impressive in terms of kung fu film making and look realistically convincing to a certain degree. She just nails it, its the kind of performance that is worthy of the sort of praise Heath ledger got for his role as joker In The Dark knight, and I really don't feel I'm over-exaggerating when I say that. But the rest if the film seems kind of poor sometimes especially towards the end where it gets weird. Its like the last half hour or so is a completely different movie altogether. So do I recommend it, If your into flawless performances from actors in film you should check this out to see Chang Pei-Pei, other than that I say just catch in on the internet somewhere or skip it.",1326067200,,876,4.315151515151515

2306807,5,B0009NZ3SW,"I don't expect much when it comes to Kung-Fu films.
A flimsy plot + spotty acting + and lots of martial arts = typical movie.
That's not a formula that's too hard to follow.
Most times there's only enough dialog to get you to the next fight scene.
Some filmakers do it better than others, while others can barely get it right.

This movie did more than ""get it right"".
The story is well thought out and the acting (for a Kung-Fu film) is really good.
What struck me most about this movie, however, was that there aren't that many fight scenes. I mean, there are some, but this movie doesn't rely on them to keep it going.
There's actually quite a bit of acting and dialog for this type of movie.
When there is a fight scene, it's quick, brutal, and amazing.

I wasn't sitting and watching the movie waiting for the next battle. I was interested in what was happening and how things were developing with the characters.
The ""bad guys"" are indeed very bad, and the ""good guys"" (in this case a young girl and a drunken man) are spectacular.

The quality of this DVD is really good. Dragon Dynasty has been releasing some great remastered versions of these films, and this was no execption. The picture is clear and the colors aren't washed out. The dubbing was well done and fit the movie.

The special features are good too, including interviews with the lead characters ""Golden Swallow"" (played by actress Cheng Pei-Pei) and her drunken ally (played by Yueh Hua).

I would definitely recommend this to any fan of Kung-Fu cinema.",1290297600,4,1527,4.538181818181818

2306809,2,B0009NZ3SW,"I disagree with most of the reviews.  I did not enjoy this film and I am a kung fu fanatic.  At the end of the movie I found myself asking....is that it?  How can this movie be classified as one of the greatest kung fu movies ever and inspired Crouching Tiger????  The fighting and acting was so-so.  The wire work?  What wire work?  If you want to see a good kung fu movie see: The Victom, Drunken Master, Iron Monkey, Fist Of White Lotus, Enter The Dragon, Tai Chi Warriar, The Invincible Armor, Snake In The Monkeys Shadow, Jet Li Legend, Fearless Hyena, Drunken Master 2, Thundering Mantis, So Close, Chocolate, Hero, Ong Bak 1 & 2, The Protector, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, Azumi and a large number of Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies.

2306810,5,B0009NZ3SW,"This was an awesome early king fu film. Considering how old this is and just how many movies like it came after wards it's clear to see that there's nothing like the real thing.

All the other reviews covered the story I can't say enough about it. The older Kung fu films always had a deeper story but not the technology to really bring it out so some ideas come off as cheesy. Now today it's vice versa...you get great kung fu with a so so story. This movie is a gem in that its story matches the fighting style. Another note to add is that I've watched a ton of these kung fu flicks and I love them but never have I really seen a female lead (especially one as pretty as Cheng Pei Pei) who can make you take her character seriously.

Another good thing about the DVD are the bonus features! You get to here commentary from her and the guy who plays Drunk Cat. I don't know it was but I always wanted to hear watch commentary by the actors that played the roles. You never get that. You always get to watch those great old movies but never get to hear the actors talk about the roles they played in the movie. Mainly due to the language barrier and just the fact that DVD's and VHS's are the reason those extra features exist now but not then for them to do it.

Overall this is a great film to add to your kung fu collection!",1285200000,,1327,4.096153846153846
2306811,5,B0009NZ3SW,"Before Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi - heck, before Uma Thurman killed Bill - Cheng Pei-pei was carving up bad guys with artistic abandon. Back in 1966, in an era when women in martial arts films were portrayed more as meek and powerless, Cheng Pei-pei got cast in the lead role of COME DRINK WITH ME and topsy-turvied that stereotype. COME DRINK WITH ME is a retro blast of awesome but, admittedly, it presents a rather shallow story arc, and the wushu stuff it demonstrates doesn't hold up to the best of modern day martial arts cinema, and yet it's good enough and Pei-pei and fellow lead actor Yueh Hua certainly exhibit cool, charismatic presence.

When ruthless bandits abduct a government official, it falls on a lethal operative named Golden Swallow (Cheng Pei-pei) to pull off a rescue attempt. Golden Swallow's reputation is so fearsome that the bandits automatically assume she's a man, and what gets me is that they continue to think of her as a man even when she finally shows up. Pei-pei is such a beautiful girl I can't imagine how you can think of her as anything but. Golden Swallow has flaws. She may be tremendously skilled but she is impetuous and impatient, and she would've had a tougher time in her investigation if she hadn't met the inebriated beggar called Drunken Cat (Yueh Hua). Predictably, there's more to Drunken Cat than just drinking and begging.

Director King Hu, with his eye for detail and willingness to break the mold, is regarded as very influential to wuxia cinema, and it's mostly because of this landmark film. COME DRINK WITH ME introduced a new approach, new dynamism, new sensibilities which have since become tropes of the genre. The stuff we're used to seeing now in martial arts movies first broke ground in COME DRINK WITH ME. Here, we get early whiffs of the drunken master and the strong deadly heroine and even early vestiges of wire work. Certainly, the stylized fighting, the nod to Peking Opera, and the nighttime rooftop chase would later influence CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (which also features Cheng Pei-pei as the villain Jade Fox).

Both Pei-pei and Yueh Hua were martial arts actors who didn't know martial arts when they first started out. Pei-pei had a background in ballet, and Hua mimicked just enough moves to make him look convincing onscreen. And they're talented enough to pull it off. The skills test in the tavern scene resonates enough on an iconic level that it's undoubtedly inspired many a wuxia film to insert its own tavern sequence.

Not that the film is flawless. The story today comes off as serviceable but predictable. The action sequences are good; the leads sell the mayhem, but here and there you notice Director King Hu hedging with some sly edit cuts. There also may have been a half-hearted attempt at romance, but that ultimately goes nowhere. There is an abbot supposedly with formidable fighting skills and he's set up to go against Drunken Cat, except that the two times they engage, the abbot is handled fairly quickly. And maybe it's just me, but the exhibition of hai gung - the projection of internal energy - seems kinda weak. But I'm just nitpicking. The relevance is in the context. I can't imagine what it must have been like in 1966 when COME DRINK WITH ME came out with its wild new ideas, but this flick must've generated some excited babble at the water cooler. Were there water coolers in 1966?

The DVD's bonus features include: audio commentary from Cheng Pei-pei and Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan; ""The King and I"" - acclaimed modern-day Chinese director Tsui Hark (who remade Hu's DRAGON GATE INN) reflects on King Hu (00:13:55 minutes); ""Come Speak With Me"" is an exclusive interview with Cheng Pei-pei in English (00:16:41); ""A Classic Remembered"" is a thoughtful retrospective with Bey Logan (00:17:24); ""Return of the Drunken Master"" is an exclusive interview with Yueh Hua in English (00:17:51); and the original theatrical trailers (with sub-titles) for COME DRINK WITH ME and HEROES OF THE EAST.

FYI: In 1968 Cheng Pei-pei reprised her role in the sequel GOLDEN SWALLOW. I'm assuming it's not yet out in DVD because I can't find it anywhere, but, man, I'm dying to see it.",1274572800,,4198,4.807479224376731

House Of Flying Daggers is also said to be dedicated to this movie. Another ground breaking feature is the use of a female heroine as the central protagonist, something that was to continue with King Hu's subsequent movies. Come Drink With Me is widely considered to be one of very best Hong Kong movies ever made.

Although this is a 44 year old (as of this writing) Hong Kong movie, this release is from Dragon Dynasty, who acquired rights for the North American releases for Celestial Pictures, holder of the Shaw Brothers library of films. Dragon Dynasty is unequaled at bringing the very best of Asian cinema to North America and creating the very best restorations, commentaries and treatments. Started by Bey Logan and Quentin Tarantino in collaboration with The Weinstein Company, the love and passion Bey and Quentin have for Asian cinema shows in every Dragon Dynasty release. Even though the films are often very old (40 years or more), Dragon Dynasty does a stellar job of creating the very best restorations to DVD and Blue Ray media commercially viable. Come Drink With Me is, perhaps, one of the best examples of the quality of their work. After watching this DVD it is hard to belive it is a 44 year old Hong Kong film.

There are several aspects of Come Drink With Me that allow it to stand on its own today, after 44 years. Summarized, I would say it has dramatic credibility and finesse. Although the wuxia story is fairly plain, King Hu took it and elevated it through actor/actress presence, dramatic interaction, dramatic tension, good dialog and a stylized action choreography. The action choreography incorporates elements of Peking Opera, ballet and realism into artistic and natural action scenes. King Hu delibertately selected a ballet dancer, Cheng Pei-Pei, for the lead female protagonist. Sung by the lead male protagonist are three songs blended in as plot elements. The male protagonist, a beggar, uses the songs for ad hoc entertainment of patrons of an inn to get money to feed his collection of orphan children. The last of the songs also communicates critical hints to the female protagonist about the location of her kidnapped brother. King Hu uses well crafted sets to enhance the dramatic presentation. Through King Hu's skillful blend, the viewer's ""suspension of disbelief"", necessary to any dramatic art form, is completely natural. By the time one gets to the end of the film, the obviously ""fantastic"" elements of the wuxia genre don't seem unnaturally out of place.

If I were to choose any one movie to introduce someone to classic Hong Kong wuxia movies, this would, without question, be the one.",1269302400,2,3798,6.095327102803738

Nearly four decades before ""Kill Bill"", the groundbreaking Shaw Brothers classic ""Come Drink With Me"" set the bar for swordwielding kung fu heroines.

To take down the clan's five ruthless tigers, she teams up with a hard-drinking martial arts mentor, who helps her to cut a path of destruction through her enemies. Featuring pioneer wire work, landmark fight scenes, and a stylized sense of cool far ahead of its era, ""Come Drink With Me"" may be the most influencial martial arts film of all time.

2306819,5,B0009NZ3SW,"Come Drink With Me is one of those films that is both prototypical and archetypal, and has great continuing interest for true fans of the genre, but one that will probably strike most casual viewers as somewhat boring and dated.  So many films took elements of this one, and in some cases improved upon them, and worked out various production kinks, that this movie might initially seem like nothing special.

For example, while this film does feature many spectacularly staged fights, the producers hadn't yet developed the technique of inserting sound effects when blows connect, so to a modern audience, the blows don't come across as powerful, lacking that ""wham!"" sound. This is a subtle, but meaningful trick that has completely pervaded all modern movie making. Seeing a movie without it is just jarring and hard to adjust to.

Also, running battles featuring a single fighter versus a large group that range over a big set, have become such a backbone of Kung-Fu movies, and have since been so utterly perfected (by Tsui Hark, Corey Yuen Kwai, and Yuen Wo-Ping), that most casual viewers won't see it as anything special here.

Similarly, the tough-as-nails female protagonist, the motley crew of wacky villains, and much more, all became such staples of the genre that to see them in their prototypical incarnation will probably be meaningless for viewers who aren't steeped in the history of Hong Kong cinema.

All of the above being said, if you are already a fan of, or are interested in getting more into the rich heritage of martial arts films, Come Drink With Me is essential viewing.

If you get the disc by Dragon Dynasty, the transfer is excellent and the bonus features are superb (great contributions from Bey Logan, as usual). The subtitles are actually horrid, but fans may be used to substandard translations and have a high tolerance for them.

Viewers relatively new to the genre would do well to watch the bonus introduction to the movie by Bey Logan, and the one by Tsui Hark, in order to get properly prepared to appreciate this landmark film.",1248048000,4,2071,4.8664772727272725

2306822,5,B0009NZ3SW,"This film, Come Drink with Me (Great Drunken Hero), is one of my favorite Asian movies, and I think it is perhaps comparable to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai in terms of its contribution to the evolution of East Asian movies during the 1950s-1970s.  I first saw this movie in either 1966 or 1967 at a movie theatre in the Far East, and recently I've seen it many more times on this DVD.  The storyline takes place during the Ming Dynasty (either the 15th or the 16th century) in China's Two-River Province.  The heroine Zhang, also known as Jin Yan Zi (meaning Golden Swallow), tries to rescue her older brother, the head prosecutor of the province, from captivity by the Five-Tiger Bandits.  At the same time, a drunken beggar and martial-arts master Fan, called Da-Bei (meaning Big Drink), has to face the monk Liao Kung (Diao Jintang), his sworn older brother from the same Kung-fu league, to keep the Green Bamboo Pole that symbolizes the leadership of the Green Bamboo League.  These two subplots merge together to become the overall story of this film: with the help of the drunken master, Zhang gets her brother back by destroying the ruthless bandits, and the evil-minded wushu master Diao, who turns out to be the real leader of the bandits, is also defeated by Fan in the final battle.

The story line appears somewhat simple, but it is meaningful in a sense that a wuxia story is told in a traditional Chinese way.  The film is composed of beautifully choreographed sword fight sequences, seasoned with a subtle undertone of a romantic (although platonic) relationship between Zhang and Fan.  The carefully designed costumes representing the Ming Dynasty period, combined with the Beijing opera style music embedded in the early part of the movie, give the impression of being in genuine traditional Chinese scenes.  The three songs sung by the drunken master in the inn, with background chorus and music performance by ten beggar children, enhance the exotic nature of the film.  The first song introduces Fan himself, by revealing his view of life as a vagabond and a beggar, suggesting that life is momentary and empty, fame and fortune are meaningless, and all the sorrows of life can be forgotten by drinking.  The second song describes Fan's concern about the current perilous situation of the Two-River Province under the rule of lawless bandits.  The third song shows his intention to help Zhang rescue her brother, by providing a hint for Zhang to decode regarding the location where her brother is being held by the bandits.  An additional genuine Chinese element of this film is that the two masters of martial arts (Fan and Diao) possess and use a mystical power (ch'i kung) in battle, which commonly emerges in many Chinese wuxia novels.  I like the slow pace of the sword fighting in the movie, much better choreographed than the battle scenes seen in many later wuxia films where the super-fast sword fighting sequences give the impression of being fake, artificial, and robotic.

While living in the Far East during the1960s, I became addicted to Chinese movies and saw over two dozen films (mostly dramas, epic and fantasy films by the Shaw Brothers).  These included four wuxia films: Great Drunken Hero (Come Drink with Me), Dragon Gate Inn, One-Armed Swordsman, and Golden Swallow, in chronological order.  While all these four wuxia films are interesting, Great Drunken Hero is the best made, and in my opinion far superior to over-hyped modern successes in the West, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  With the role of heroine Zhang in this movie, Cheng Pei-Pei obtained fame almost comparable to that of superstar Li Ching among movie-goers in East Asia during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The quality of this DVD is very good, including well-restored sharp images, in light of the fact that the film is more than forty years old.  Having seen this movie in different versions with subtitles in English and other languages, I think the English subtitles in this DVD are clear and straightforward.  Personally I don't like to watch a dubbed version of foreign movies, and that holds true in this case, too.  You get the impression in the English dubbing of this DVD that words were chosen so that the sound matches the lip movements rather than delivering the literal meanings of the actors' dialogues.  One thing I should mention here is that, in the English dubbed mode, the bandits recognize the heroine as a woman from their first encounter.  This is erroneous, since the bandits actually do not realize that the heroine is a woman until they meet her again in the temple.  You should watch this film in the original Mandarin soundtrack with English subtitles.

I believe this DVD definitely deserves a five-star rating",1224374400,80,4767,4.898009950248756
2306823,4,B0009NZ3SW,"""Pei Pei is wonderful in her role as Golden Swallow and Yueh Hua as the drunken beggar/martial arts master incognito is fantastic here. This film boasts the inspiration for what was to become martial arts cinema as we know it. Shaw Brothers productions make an all out attempt at realism. The villians are cruel, and very brutal, especially the White Faced Killer. The dialogue is extremely well thought out and the english dubbed translations may be a little better than the mandarin translations to english subtitles. Another interseting feature to the disc are the interviews. Yueh Hua actually confess' in his interview, to having been actually drunk during the scene where he's drinking while under guard by the villians, interestingly the director informed Yueh that's one of his best scenes in the film. The sets are simply fantastic examples of rustic 18th century china. The scene where Yueh Hua is tending to Pei Pei's wounds at his humble abode (any beggar would be truly fortunate to have a waterfall in their back yard), and is accosted there by the villians who wish to remove Pei Pei by force, is very well done and the set is beautiful. This is where Yueh Hua reveals his true identity, and his disguise of being a drunken beggar to all involved in the stories plot, though Pei Pei is wise to this very early on. The final fight is a bit of an anti-climax but not enough to cause the veiwer to be disappointed. A must have for any who truly appreciate classic Shaws Bros. martial arts films. The picure quality of this DVD is absolutely beautiful.""",1220227200,2,1564,4.732600732600733
2306824,4,B0009NZ3SW,"Back in the early 80's a local TV station here in the Detroit area used to have something called Kung-Fu Theater every Saturday night.  These were very cheaply made films with little plot and even less character development but it didn't matter...These were Kung-Fu films and young male viewers ate them up.  It seemed they all had a Bruce Lee clone as the star and they even used variations of the late actor's name such as Bruce Lei or Bruce Le.  It was all good stuff!

Come Drink with Me is an early martial arts classic from 1966, written and directed by legendary martial arts filmmaker, King Hu.  It's choreography and wire stunts would influence such modern films as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Kill Bill.  In fact, its lead actress, Cheng Pei Pei, would play an important role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon over thirty years later.

A bandit clan has kidnapped the son of a governor and is holding him as ransom for the return of their leader who is imprisoned.  Instead, the Governor sends his daughter, the expert swordswoman named Golden Swallow to rescue her brother.  The bandit second-in-command, Jade Faced Tiger, sends a group of his men to try and kill Golden Swallow at a nearby Inn.  This sets up the first major fight of the film as Golden Swallow shows off her skills, easily defeating the bandits.  Quentin Tarantino was heavily influenced by this scene for the restaurant fight in Kill Bill Part 1.  Golden Swallow was the prototype for Uma Thurmond's character.

When she tries to rescue her brother from the temple the bandits have taken over, she finds herself vastly outnumbered but gets aid from the near-mythical master martial artist known as Drunken Cat.  Pulling the strings behind the bandits is Drunken Cat's rival the evil Abbot Liao Kung who murdered Cat's master years earlier.

Come Drink With Me is a remarkable film on several levels.  Neither of the main two stars were proficient in the martial arts before making the film.  Their abilities came from a combination of training during the film, brilliant choreography, and clever film tricks.  The film techniques look a bit dated over forty years later but you can certainly see why this film was such a hit in Hong Kong and considered one of the best martial arts films ever made.

Cheng Pei Pei is dynamic as Golden Swallow and the fact that a female was cast as the heroic lead in a film from the 1960s is truly amazing.  She is beautiful, tough, and yet still sensitive in her portrayal, reluctantly taking aid from Drunken Cat.  Yueh Hua was equally adept as master Drunken Cat, providing comic relief initially appearing as a drunken fool but aiding Swallow so skillfully that it went without notice.

The widescreen DVD release is a gorgeous transfer and you'd never guess the film was over forty years old.  The rumor is that Quentin Tarrantino is planning on doing a remake of the film.
