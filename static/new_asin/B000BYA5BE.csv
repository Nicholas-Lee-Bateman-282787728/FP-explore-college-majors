2445528,5,B000BYA5BE,Bought the first volume when it came out and the disks were full of freezing and skipping.  Emailed the company and they sent me replacement disks.  You would think they would have solved the problem before vol. 2 came out.  Guess I got to email BCI again.  Damn!,1139961600,2,263,4.416666666666667
2445529,5,B000BYA5BE,"I wrote reviews for both the He-Man ""Best Of"" collection DVD, and the Season One, Volume 1 DVD, which were fantastic. I'll be stopping off on the way home from work tonight to pick up my Season One, Volume 2 DVD...and, call me a dork, I can't wait.

Yes, I'm years removed from being that 12-year-old kid who flew off the bus after school to park his fat little butt on the chair religiously every day to watch ""He-Man and the Masters Of The Universe"". But, as the years go by, the memories fade, and thanks to the majesty of DVD, we can go back in time and enjoy guilty pleasures such as this wonderful show that consumed so much of my life.

Some of my favorite episodes are on this DVD collection, most of which I have not seen since at least 1985. And, like what I experienced during my viewing of Volume 1, the memories will come flying back. It was so cool watching these episodes, and somehow remembering what happens. Once you hear that music, it's like being transported back to your youth. Isn't that alone worth the money?

The treatment that this show has received in these DVD releases is nothing short of fantastic. From the DVD's themselves, to the artwork that they are packaged in. It's like 1983 all over again.

Ohhh yes, my wife will ridicule and laugh at me for sitting around content, on my same fat butt, watching these episodes. But I don't care. Let her laugh. I'm enjoying myself.

By all means, if you ever enjoyed this show, pick up these DVD's. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1139875200,16,1515,4.4352517985611515
2445530,5,B000BYA5BE,"""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" debuted when I was 11 years old.  I remember practically running home from school each day so as not to miss a single word.  I absolutely loved the daily dose of action in Eternia, and then applying ideas gleaned from the show to playing with my action figures.

Even now at 33 years old, I still find these cartoons to be highly enjoyable.  They bring back a lot of fond memories, and the morals taught in them still hold true today.  They've held up over time and can be enjoyed by today's children too.

This collection of the second half of the first season contains one of my favorite episodes, ""The House of Shokoti"".  It was the series' only two-parter that I can recall.  Ram Man's continual butchering of Shokoti's name, with her finally shouting at him ""Shokoti, you fool!"" was priceless.  The episode also contained a character simply referred to as ""Mask"" who never saw a plastic rendition, much to my chagrin.  He perished at the end of the first half though, so that is probably why.  He was still an awesome foe who would have been a welcome addition to my figure lineup.

Among the special features contained in this box set, ""Commercial Spots"" is mentioned.  I can only hope that means the little blurbs before and after the commercial breaks featuring Orko.  Remember those?  There were at least four of them that I can recall.  Orko's head bursting through an orange field saying He-Man would be right back, then a sad-eyed Orko repairing the hole he had made with tape.  Also, Orko rapidly whipping off-screen so fast he lost his hat and cloak, then his bare arms reaching back on-screen to grab them.  Plus, Orko spinning in from the distance like a tornado, saying his message, then spinning back off into the distance in the same tornado-like fashion.  One other one was Orko working his magic with the little sparkles.  While I'm glad that they are not included in each episode on the DVD's, I still was hoping for the opportunity to give them another look in a supplemental section.  Hopefully they ARE contained here as the item referred to as ""Commercial Spots"".  I don't know for sure.

With all the episodes this set contains, as well as the wealth of bonus materials, this would be a great buy for anyone wanting something exciting and entertaining for their children to watch, or for a child of the 80's like me who enjoys re-living a piece of his or her childhood.",1139702400,14,2437,4.616279069767442

He-Man was My First cartoon purchase in 2007. I learned it was released in 2006. Had I known I would have bought it sooner. Since then I have been collecting one cartoon series after another. I am a cartoon junky! What's wrong with that? I can't stop. Cartoon syndication of the 1980's pretty much has a corner-on-the- market of the greatest. Until, Dragon Ball Z. As far as I am concerned He-Man still has The Title. A part of society of epic proportion and unparralled grandeur, making them impossible to forget and love with everlasting admiration. Masterpieces in their own right of unsurpassable stature in cartoon history.",1236643200,,832,4.744827586206896

2445543,4,B000BYA5BE,"Una de las series mas significativas de los 80's que dej huella en aquella generacin que la disfrut. Este es el  volumen dos de la primera temporada con 32 episodios en 5 discos, mas un disco con bonus extras.",1224374400,,209,4.358974358974359
2445544,4,B000BYA5BE,"In keeping with the wonderful tradition of the first He-Man Season One box set, Volume 2 picks up where the first 33 episodes of the series left off. Again packaged in a beautifully decorated 6-disc set, Volume 2 contains the final 32 episodes of the acclaimed first season of Filmation's He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.

Upon going directly from the first volume into the second, some changes between the show's formatting are subtly apparent. First of these changes is Filmation's reliance upon freelance writers to deliver the show's incredible numbers (65 episodes is monumental for a single season of animation, even to this day). With the deeper pool of script submissions to pull from, the result is much more variety in terms of plots, locations, and even themes. Despite his appearance on the cover art, Skeletor is used much less often in the second half of the first season. The entire scope of Eternia itself is pushed much further in this collection. So much so in fact that it is rare for our heroes to travel to the same location for an episode-resolve more than once or twice throughout the entire season. Not bad considering the restrictions and limitations plaguing all animation in the early 1980s.

Still in tact are the strong morals and ethical advice that provided the backbone (and ending tag) of every single Masters of the Universe episode. By the second half of the first season, the writers had become increasingly efficient at burying the ending tag ""lessons"" beneath the surface-level of the show's themes, which makes for a more satisfying experience in recapping what we've learned.

In addition, not being forced to rely upon Skeletor and his brood as the show's antagonist, really opened up some epic conflict situations not uncommon from those that have graced the pages of classic literature for years. Among the gems in the second volume are Amazonian women, vengeful griffons, misunderstood giants, and my personal favorite- an intelligent ancient dragon named Granamyr. Eternia is transformed into a truly epic land of fantasy and intrigue right from the onset of this collection.

Like before, BCI Eclipse has pulled all the stops in terms of their packaging and presentation of this cherished material. The cover art and flip-out inner sleeve are again gorgeous as are the disc art itself and accompanying book. BCI continues to shed light on the whole Filmation phenomenon once again on the 6th disc of the set with 2 more documentary pieces that are a sheer joy to conclude such an impressive package. This time around we again here from the show's writers and creative staff on the stories behind the stories on various selections of the 34-65th episodes. Additionally, but equally interesting, is the second documentary in which we are given a back-stage pass to the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con where the genius of Filmation and a host of other talent (Bruce Timm & Paul Dini for example) promote the then-brand new release of The Best of He-Man on DVD. Suffice to say, the quality and attention to detail that BCI is loading these DVD collections with is present and appreciated in this special behind-the-scenes look of a well-known event.

Also like last time, this set includes another pair of 4 x 6 inch collectible art cards, this time by Earl Norem and Gilbert Hernandez. Full-length animated storyboard and complete scripts (PDF format) are also included.

The following 32 episodes are included in this set (which completes the first season):

The Dragon's Gift
The Sleepers Awaken
The Search
It's Not My Fault
Valley of Power
Trouble in Arcadia
House of Shokoti"" Part 1
House of Shokoti"" Part 2
Double Edged Sword

In conclusion, fans of the show have much to be excited about in this, the second volume of the first season of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. From a writing (and production standpoint) much of the restriction that held the first half of the season back had been realized and addressed. Most notable is the simple expansion of the environments and nearly endless roster of characters that we are introduced to along the way. Love or hate the series itself, there is nothing but praise that I can report about the presentation of this product. The attention to detail is absolutely phenomenal from the box itself on down to the full color episode-book with a synopsis and still of each and every episode within. Even the menu work is top notch with synopsis' and sample clips for each episode. About the best thing that can happen to a show coming to DVD is discovering that BCI Eclipse is going to be handling the project. They're really that good.",1209945600,2,5089,4.854838709677419

I liked He Man, animation was horrid but when He Man would say ""I have the power!""  (I think he said that), you knew he was gonna kick some skeleton ass! I even dug the freakin movie, thats how much I liked He Man. Would I purchase He Man on dvd? No freakin way, my adult friends would laugh their butts off if they saw that in my house and there'd be no way I could tell them it was for my kids, no one would buy that. I Have the POWER!!!!!

Its true what the Producers said in the first Volume. Never had a bigger female audience!  Back in 98, I was one of those people who searched all over eBay and creation to find all the original VHS's which I did manage to get my hands on some. Now that they are all available on DVD what do I do with them now?!? Even have the original Secret of the Sword movie poster framed for all eternity. Can't wait for She-Ra to come out next.

But yes my memories of He-Man are long and nostalgic, even inspired me to draw him and She-Ra. This a character not to be missed and he will be remembered through time.",1141084800,6,746,4.033783783783784

One item of note: In the episode ""Dree Elle's Return"" when they were combating the Horn of Evil, the song Orko and Dree Elle sang appears to have been changed. I remember a song there which included the words ""Let the sun shine in"". I could be mistaken as I haven't finished watching the set.
