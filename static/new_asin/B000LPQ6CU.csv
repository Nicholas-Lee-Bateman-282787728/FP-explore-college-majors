8163307,5,B000LPQ6CU,I liked this alot.  I will give it 5 stars.  Loved it.  So hit or miss these days with anime.  This film was very good.  Not too heavy.  Not too light.  Perfect!,1395964800,,161,3.84375
8163308,4,B000LPQ6CU,"While I completely agree that the story is lacking, and this would've been better had this been the beginning of a series, I really liked it for what it was. In many respects this film is a western in the veign of Clint Eastwood films. The drifter who rights wrongs happens upon a traveller. He witnesses the death of the traveller and he takes it upon himself out of guilt as well as justice to save someone for the doomed traveller. And that's just the set up. The film itself is kind of disjointed but it does weave an interesting tale, and as I said had this been the beginning of a series or at least series of OVAs we could've gone into depth of the history and back story of the Amen-ohsa, Jushin and the world itself. I would really like a sequel/prequel to this.",1327968000,,771,4.287671232876712

8163310,5,B000LPQ6CU,"This anime caught my eye since my friend and I are always on the lookout for good anime thats not too goofy or primarily T&A.

I do agree with other reviews that it lacked story, but we were basically just looking for a good action movie. The lead character was very enjoyable in that he didn't screw around. In many movies you get characters that do stupid stuff and you're left staring at the screen going,""Come on! Just shoot him!"" And Munsu delivers big time.

But the lack of back story and overall development of many characters did leave me wanting more. What story is there is pretty straight forward and isn't as confusing or mystifying as many other animes.

So if you just want a good action anime I highly recommend this, good action combined with beautiful animation.",1203206400,5,780,4.597122302158273
8163311,2,B000LPQ6CU,"My wife actually got this, and didn't know it was actually based on a Korean comic.  Not that there's anything wrong with manhwa, we're just not familiar with it. In any event, we went into this with an open mind, particularly because this was a joint Korean-Japan production and the story and art looked really good.

I won't go into a summary of the anime, but I will say that the story lacked...well, a story.  The origins of the ""amen osa"" are briefly covered in an introduction and that's it.  No other back story is given and this DVD comes across as two episodes of a greater series, even though it isn't.  Character names are dropped, but the story behind the name is never visited or even resolved.  Characters are who they are just because they are.  No explanation is given for most anything.

Don't get me wrong, though, the characters are interesting enough that I would like to see more of this world.  However, as far as I know, this was a one-shot deal, so it's a little disappointing.

Moving on to the animation, the artwork is top-notch.  It blends computer and hand-drawn animation beautifully, and the fight scenes are great.  The computer rendering of Munsu's (the main character) phantoms are especially nice.  I was very pleased with the look of this anime, as is to be expected for a theatrical release.

With that said, though, I think most people will be left wanting more or just being confused with the lack of story.

For those looking to buy this for kids, I don't recommended it for anyone 16 or under.  There isn't any nudity, but there is a fair amount of blood and violence that may be disturbing to small children or young adults.",1201046400,8,1666,4.577702702702703
