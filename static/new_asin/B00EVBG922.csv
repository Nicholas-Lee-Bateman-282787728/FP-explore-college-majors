5948468,5,B00EVBG922,"I loved every second of this for every reason that might be imagined. Outdoor music? They knew what they were doing from amplified instruments to clothes pins keeping pages in place. The artists and the conductor I have loved for a long time... and Red Square means the world to me. I join Russians on May 9 every year for the Victory Day parade ...broadcast in HD via YouTube. I like that celebration for many reasons. But, my comment is this, the Deutsche Grammophone Blu-ray is spectacular. The magnificent flying camera may have been a little too fascinated with flight. I would have preferred a little more calm camerawork. But the show is a wonderful treasure. Don't miss it. Repeat showings will be in order.",1386806400,3,715,4.728

5948470,5,B00EVBG922,I love the Red Square performances - enthusiastic participation of the audience and a real admiration and appreciation of their talented artists DH and AN.,1386547200,,155,5.24
5948471,5,B00EVBG922,"In the June of this year, I was fortunate to attend this concert in person - it leaves an unforgettable impression through its two stars, the orchestra, the conductor, and the venue itself. Since then, I was eagerly awaiting this concert's release on DVD.
It opens with dramatic ""La forza del destino"" overture - setting the emotional bar high right from the start.
Dmitry Hvorostovsky indulges the audience with his consistently powerful presence and superb performance -  both vocally and artistically. With every number, he commands the highest attention of the audience and leaves one wondering how it's possible to project the human voice as strongly and perfectly as he does.
Incredible and brilliant, his signature performances - Rodrigo's aria from Don Carlo ""O Carlo, ascolta..."" and ""Tutto e deserto..."" from Il trovatore  - leave listeners in nothing less than absolute emotional bliss.

Anna Netrebko took a courageous step to broaden her repertoire with heavily dramatic arias that she never performed before - the thrill was apparent, and it is a pleasure to hear new material performed by a master artist. She is reaching new heights of vocal and dramatic interpretation in the ""La Mamma Morta"" by Giordano  leaving one in inner tears of awe and admiration.
Anna is mesmerizing - with each aria she takes you on a magic journey of deepest feelings and explorations of human soul and mind. Anna's voice is never unemotional, and neither is her physical presence. Her appearance on stage is divine - noble and visually perfect from any angle.

The whole program has it's internal dynamic. The first part is a celebration of the superbly inspired Italians - Verdi, Giordano, Puccini  with the climatic summit of Russian genius of Tchaikovsky.
Undoubtedly, the crescendo of the evening arrived in the form of the flagship performance of Russian opera - the number from ""Eugene Onegin"". Both singers took the duet (""O! Kak mne tiazhelo...."") on unprecedented heights of vocal and dramatic performance. Poetically charged and enticingly sad, it was an absolute emotional catharsis that took away the breaths of thousands of listeners; ... my only hope is that even for non-Russian speakers, the power of the performance translates without words and impacts minds with its tearfully beautiful and sorrowful harmonies.

The chorus and orchestra, under the elegant and precise control of the conductor  Mr. Constantine Orbelian, indulge the audience with galvanizing Verdi and Tchaikovsky numbers . The chorus itself sends a wave of emotions with their charged performance of ""Va', pensiero..."" from Nabucco and  ""Uzh kak po mostu, mostochku"" from Eugene Onegin; the sound of a hundred voices of the chorus conveys power, impulse, and energy. One of the conductor's highlights of the evening was majestic, gracious and uplifting Polonaise from Onegin, performed with much pride, passion and dignity.
The final numbers- ""Dark Eyes/Ochi Chernye"" and ""Moscow Nights/Podmoskovnye Vechera""- were a wonderfully arranged gift to the audience. The common spirit of unbridled love for music was surely palpable - thousands of people were singing along with the stars and the orchestra.
Few words about the conductor: Maestro Orbelian is a very intelligent musician with extremely high  intuition, refined esthetic taste, and superlative capacity to conduct and interpret any musical material. This is his second performance on the Red Square (his first was in 2004; it was the very first concert ever allowed on the Red Square!).
Maestro Orbelian worked with many world-renowned opera stars and international orchestras, with very extensive discography ([...] and is known for his prized ability to deeply understand soloists' unique abilities and to make musical integration surprisingly clever and charming.

Thanks to all who directed, produced, and performed  -  this DVD is a rare and unusual celebration of Italian and Russian geniuses  ""en plein air "" -  featuring two giants of modern opera, and a host of other delights for the listener.",1385856000,25,4043,5.285491419656786
5948472,5,B00EVBG922,"I was thrilled to receive this amazing DVD as a gift. I'm a regular at the MET and just saw Dmitri in the famous ""Las Vegas"" production of Rigoletto. He is truly an extraordinary artist giving every last ounce of emotion yet keeping that amazing velvety voice rounded and glorious.  I was lucky enought to hear Anna Netrebko in Onegin in Vienna with Dmitri as well last spring. I was so moved by this new DVD, becuase it reminded me of my first trip behind the Iron Curtain when no one could possibly think of doing a concert on Red Square- we saw it and thought of it as the place where May Day parades and November 7th parades commemorating the Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution took place. How wonderful to know and see how times have changed. Kudos to the powers that be allow and support events like this. Who but Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Anna Netrebko would be able to command the 10,000 people sitting on Red Square along with millions watching LIVE on TV around the world. The sound, the camera work, the setting, the colors and the lighting are magnificent. Put this together with the most vibrant and stunning performances of Verdi, Puccini, Giordano and of course Tchaikovsky.  This an unforgettable event to be cherished by all opera lovers. In fact, it should be cherished by NON Opera lovers as well, becuase they WILL fall in love with these two great singers and will become opera lovers. If you're thinking of what to get your friends for Christmas- you need not look further. Your friends will thank you every time they watch this performance masterfully conducted by Maestro Constantine Orbelian, whom we know from the gorgeous film he made with Dmitri and Renee Fleming (A Musical Odyssey in St. Petersburg) and many excellent recordings on the DELOS label.",1384992000,6,1790,4.733974358974359
5948473,5,B00EVBG922,"This certainly was the concert of a lifetime. I was in Moscow last summer and couldn't imagine my surprise when friends offered me a ticket to see Anna Netrebko and Dmitri Hvorostovsky my favorite Russian Opera stars performing on no less, Red Square. The Conductor, Constantine Orbelian led the wonderful State Symphony Orchestra of Russia with his requisite expertise. The sound quality was extraordinarily good for an outdoor event and the picture and sound quality DVD which I just purchased and watched is  spectacular. The arias performed in the first half of the program showed Anna Netrebko and Dmitri Hvorostovsky in rare expressive form, performing Verdi in this most unusual setting. The atmosphere was that of a closely knit family which was there to show their love and appreciation for their favorite son and daughter! The weather was 'special ordered' for the event and couldn't have been more comfortable or inviting. Netrebko lavished the audience with arias from Vespri and Trovatore which have not yet been performed on the stage. She is definitely heading into the heavier and meatier roles with a passion and her own personal interpretive stamp. The second half of the concert showed Dmitri singing the Te Deum from Tosca (I hope that he will perform that role soon) with typical Hvorostovsky menace and tremendous vocal presence. Anna performed Giordano's La Mamma Morta with the kind of pathos and emotion that evokes memories of Maria Callas. Of course, a Red Square concert wouldn't be complete without Russian music and we were treated with an extraordinarily moving and touching final scene from Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Onegin is Dmitri's signature role, and I have seen Dmitri perform this role all over the world at the greatest opera houses but, never, have I seen Anya in a more heartfelt and personally expressive performance than this one. You could actually see the tears in her eyes and hear the anguish in her voice. It seemed as if everything stopped.. the air stopped moving, people stopped breathing and even though we all know how the piece was going to send- we had wished and hoped that miraculously something would happen and those two lost souls would be united and would live happily ever after. Netrebko's Tatiana from that evening will remain in my heart forever. Constantine Orbelian supported every emotion and nuance with traditional expertise as well as offering the public tremendous and personal interpretations of Verdi's Overture to Forza and Tchaikovsky's Polonaise from Onegin. The chorus added a wonderful touch and performed with precision and vitality. The Encores- Silva's aria from Kalman's Die Czardasfurstin sung in Russian was riveting, colorful and rousing with Netrebko performing with rare abandon, then Dmitri sang Otche Chronie (Dark Eyes) as only he can and then they teamed up for a final encore of Russia's most famous  international hit Moscow Nights with the entire audience of 10,000 people singing along with them.  What an experience- never to repeated and never to be forgotten. If you weren't lucky enough to be there on June 19th, 2013, then you'll have the thrill of a lifetime when you watch this unique DVD performed by not only Russia's best, but, the world's BEST operatic artists on the stage today.",1384992000,58,3291,5.1020408163265305
5948474,3,B00EVBG922,"The first hour of this outdoor concert in Red Square is devoted mainly to Verdi, with indifferent results considering the amount of hype heaped on: ""Truly the concert of a lifetime . . . . musical magnificence . . ."" This is baloney. Aside from the Rigoletto aria ""Cortigiani, vil razza dannat"" that concludes the opening hour of European arias where Hvorostovsky comes alive and gets fierce, the performances are merely competent. Fortunately, the concert comes to a conclusion with 35"" of Russian music, including the final scene from Eugene Onegin where dramatic involvement infuses the singing but the impact is lessened by the singers being immobilized in their assigned places on stage. The final 12"" of the concert are the most successful, given over to folk songs awash in lovely sentimentality: ""Dark Eyes"" and ""Moscow Nights"". Such folk songs should have been the backbone of the concert and things would have jelled better musically and in terms of establishing connections to the audience. The orchestra is more like a summer band than an orchestra and the choir is victimized by the generally poor accoustics that only acquit themselves well with the two soloists. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp, even without Blu-Ray, and the panorama of Red Square and the city beyond are soothing and agreeable as darkness descends. The elaborate camera trackings of near and far across the vast spaces are formulaic and not integrated into the musical experience. Anna Netrebko has put on weight and become sedentary, hampering her stage presence and her voice has lost its miraculous lustre. Hvorostovsky carries most of the concert by himself, but overall nothing even approximates the ""musical magnificence"" boasted of in the hype. Overall, this is a standard, nuts and bolts concert, far from exceptional. What remains in the memory are the final 12"" of traditional Russian favorites that owe as much to the nostalgic content of the songs themselves and their secure place in the Russian soul, as to Hvorostovky's superb charisma and his fine contributions from the stage during these final 12"".

Fortunately there IS an unforgettable and standout concert with Netrebko at her very best and it's been described as ""the rare kind of concert that gives rise to myths"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Berlin-Concert-Live-from-the-Waldbhne/dp/B000JJSRNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Berlin Concert: Live from the Waldbhne</a>.

5948475,2,B00EVBG922,"Both singers were in great voice and sang magnificently throughout.  They probably sang expressively, too, but the camera-work was so bad you only got fast glimpses of them off and on, while a squadron of drones was swooping in slow motion all over (and over and over) Red Square filming church spires and onion domes and sometimes the vast audience, which was arranged in battalions of chairs looking prosperous but bored, as if they'd been forced to sit through a long church service in a language they didn't understand.  The singers tried and tried to wake them up but couldn't--until the very end when they sang a few wonderful popular Russian favorites.  These finally got the audience smiling and even singing along.  A very frustrating DVD; there are much better ones available featuring both singers.",1489449600,2,809,4.970370370370371

With the recent performance of Il Trovatore at the Met (represented here by several excepts), it also reminds us of how close we almost came to
losing Dmitri in 2015 and how much more he must destroy the monster inside his brain before he (and us) can truly chant 'Victory'.
They both sang well.
It would be great to see them in 'Eugene Onegin', singing in their native language. And on video as well as recordings.
At the end of the concert, they sang 'Moscow Nights', a song that must be the unofficial Russian national anthem.  I heard a fourth verse I had
never hear in any other version.
In the end, let's say:  'Bravo, Anya!' 'Bravo, Dima!",1454630400,2,728,4.549618320610687

5948488,4,B00EVBG922,"Performing in the outdoors to a large audience presents huge challenges for singers, but Anna Netrebko and Dmitri Hvorostovsky succeeded in delivering an entertaining and memorable programme.  Most of it was of Verdi arias, although the highlight for me was the final act of Eugene Onegin - one of the few opportunities we may ever have to see this pair in an excerpt from an opera that I wish they had been able to sing together in the Metropolitan Opera live in HD series.  Visually speaking, it was all good to look at, with the shots of Red Square as evening fell being particularly beautiful - as were all three of Anna Netrebko's gowns.  One small quibble - I wish Dmitri Hvorostovsky would get rid of all the bling - he's already gorgeous to look at and doesn't need it!",1438387200,,777,4.535714285714286

5948503,5,B00EVBG922,"This live concert performance at the Red Square of Moscow features two of Russia's (and Western opera's) greatest stars: baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and soprano Anna Netrebko.
Both singers are in top form, and the chosen programme is simply marvellous - Verdi forms the main bulk in the first half, and the La Forza overture and Va Pensaro chorus are wonderful orchestral 'interludes' to the fantastic singing by Netrebko and Hvorostovksy.  Scenes and excerpts from Don Carlo, Il Trovatore, Rigoletto are highlights, especially enticing are Netrebko's 'Il Trovatore' aria and Hvorostovsky's 'Rigoletto' aria.  The two singers also gave a terrific scene from 'Il Trovatore' in the first half.  Netrebko's Leonora debut is greatly anticipated.
In the second half, the programme focused first on Italian verismo works, with a hair-standing deliverance by Hvorostovsky of the 'Te Deum' from 'Tosca'.  Netrebko gave a highly original reading of 'La Mama Morta' from 'Andrea Chenier'.  The second half's biggest moment is being announced by the orchestral pieces from 'Eugene Onegin', with Netrebko and Hvorostovsky giving an ultra passionate account of the final scene of 'Eugene Onegin'.
Having watched the operatic performances by both, it is undeniable that Russia's two super operatic stars now hold in their hands the key to top operatic performances.
The encore pieces are also highly affecting, ending in the popular 'Moscow Nights' that warms the hearts of all audiences, both at the Red Square and before the monitors.",1399766400,6,1523,5.409282700421941

Anyone who is a fan of these wonderful singers should get this DVD.
The selection of this concert is very good: arias, duets, as well as overtures and chorus were performed; they also dedicated part of this show to Italian and Russian operas as well as Russian traditional music.

They are both charismatic, attractive and talented stars. Here they seem to positively shine in their home setting. The conductor (Constantine Orbelian), orchestra (Russia's State Academic Symphony Orchestra) and choir (Academic Grand Choir) are all at the top of their game. The program itself is an entertaining mix of well-loved and dramatic pieces, mostly Verdi (celebrating Verdi's bicentenary) and Tchaikovsky, that are easy to connect with. The filming, while perhaps not revolutionary, is a good mix of close-ups and wide shots, that make you feel like you're there.

Not sure if the reviewer who commented that ""the sun was too bright for the orchestra and the artists"" actually watched the whole performance, since the majority of the concert is performed at dusk and in the early evening. As to the ""sound system seeming underpowered"", the bluray comes with DTS-HD Master Audio and sounded fabulous through my sound system. I suggest the reviewer either crank up the volume, or maybe invest in a new sound system.

This is definitely one DVD that will encourage repeated listening. I can think of few better ways to spend an evening in at home, maybe paired with some vodka and caviar.",1394755200,3,1400,5.1629955947136565

5948518,5,B00EVBG922,"There is no superlative adequate enough to apply to this performance. Of course, Anna and Dima are superb and the orchestra excellent. If it were just the performance you were expecting to enjoy, you will not be disappointed. But a most wonderful aspect of this recording is being right there in Moscow, mingling with the audience, getting a bird's eye view of Moscow with its magnificent domes and spires, the Kremlin, and St. Basil's cathedral, among other impressive buildings. One is able to view the sky over Moscow as it transforms from a soft summer sky to an early one: the moon, at first is barely visible among the soft clouds but becomes dominant as the clouds leave the sky a rich blue allowing the moon to become dominant. I know I will never be able to visit Moscow, as I am 80 years old, but this is as close as being there, sitting with the Russian people giving themselves up to the pleasure of hearing their beloved artists sing for them. This is like an opera with the finest stage setting imaginable. Please, don't deprive yourself of this marvelous experience.",1389657600,6,1081,4.664921465968586
5948519,5,B00EVBG922,"Great performance, fantastic recording. This Bluray makes one wonder why record companies still offer other formats. Really maks you feel like you're viewing this performance live.",1389312000,4,180,5.961538461538462
5948520,5,B00EVBG922,"I am not a NETREBKO fan, having seen her many times at the MET. Often she struggles to maintain pitch and so often her performances are plain ""BLAH"" - totally lifeless, like she is singing NOTES and can't wait for the opera to end! Dmitri, on the other hand is always ""ON!"" I swear he could sing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Stars and make it sound like an Operatic Master piece. This DVD of the two of them LIVE in RED SQUARE, however, is magical. Maybe it is because they are on their HOME SOIL, but it is a DVD I've watched  a half dozen times already. Anna is relaxed, full of life, and when she gets to singing in her native tongue, she is like a comletely different person than I have ever seen on the stage of the MET or in the MET in HD. She is much more at home as a dramatic soprano than trying to be a Coloratura singing Donizetti, where she really can't sing those High D's and Eb'S without being flat and out of tune. She was wonderful singing Verdi and Puccini, and just off the wall doing things in Russian. Hvorvorsky ( or however one spells his name ), as I said, is always magnificent. I think he is the PREMIER Baritone in the world today.  Nobody can go wrong by purchasing this DVD!",1388534400,10,1199,4.186147186147186
5948521,5,B00EVBG922,"The best opera concert since the 2008 Opera Gala.  Anna Netrebko is at her finest, and Dmitri Hvorostovsky and orchestra/choir were fabulous. The Blu-ray and camera work made it crystal clear with great scenic shots of Moscow. The musical selections were wonderful with Anna's vocal charisma shining through with new repertoire. The only disappointment was that Anna's aria from Adriana Lecouvreur was cut out. This was the most fantastic concert performance in a long time and the DVD is a must-have.",1387929600,2,501,5.185185185185185
5948522,4,B00EVBG922,"It is not easy to perform under the open sky. The atmosphere of a concert hall is better. But you have a sunny day for the audience. The concert is a collection of Verdi and Tchaikovsky. I like the voice, which is developed in a darker soprano. It is good for the lyrical drama. The other part is played by the Russian tenor. Both sing very well together.",1387670400,2,355,4.235294117647059

8609828,5,B00EVBG922,"After the tragic death of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, I decided to purchase as many CD's and DVD's as possible. This ""Live from Red Square""
is the best concert I've seen and Anna Netrebko was also fantastic. The concert was not just entertaining but fun. The audience reactions
were polite and fun also. My favorite song was a folk song that Anna Netrobko sang with gusto about her man had better be the type
that can give her ""both Heaven and Hell'. Loved it! As for Dmitri, I had the pleasure and honor of seeing his performance at the Met in NYC.
DVD's like this one prove that his voice, his talent, and his memory will never die.",1528243200,,627,4.413793103448276
