1948103,4,B0000UQQTE,"Dave Matthews always sounds incredible in a concert setting and this DVD is no exception.  The video format looks pretty amateurish to me, though...almost like it was filmed using consumer-level digital video cameras and simply spliced together.",1069113600,2,245,5.621621621621622
1948104,1,B0000UQQTE,"Horrible. The best song is a Neil Young cover of Cortez The Killer. Neil plays it much better. Buy Neil's stuff instead. Way over-rated and totally bogus. Sorry DM fans, but this guy has sold out BIGTIME. The worst crap out this season. Please stand up as a consumer and say ""NO"" to garbage. Don't support this Neil Young cover band! This DVD lacks all the best DM tunes. See the song list before you get ripped off by this coniving sell out! Horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK !!!",1069113600,3,477,4.311111111111111
1948105,5,B0000UQQTE,"This was a great DVD, I also have the CD.
Both are very much like the other live CD's.  One of things I love about Dave Matthews Band, is they sound great live, just like they do on their albums.  Never out of tune!  Always smooth and rythmic, and I just love the instrumental solo's, which you get a lot more of on the LIVE albums.
Even though I wasn't at the actual concer, it sound like it was an amazing concert to be at (only if I could of afforded the tickets).
Basically, to sum it up, this is a really nice gift to get for any DMB fan (even if it is for yourself)!  Splurge and buy this one, it is SO worth the money!",1068336000,4,625,3.8976377952755907
1948106,5,B0000UQQTE,"I am aware that the DVD is not yet available.  This is a review of the Concert that it was taped at.
The AOL Concert for Schools on the Great Lawn of Central Park was nothing short of spectacular.  They started the show with ""Don't drink the Water"" and over the next 2hours and 45 minutes played hit after hit including: Crush, Warehouse, All Along the Watchtower, Dancing Nacies, Tripping Billies and so many others.  The set design was fantastic and their production team deserves a great deal of credit for the work they do.  They do a tremendous job of using the lighting on and around the stage to enhance the music, and it works very well.
The best part about the concert was ofcourse the band.  I have been to concerts given by U2, Bruce Sprintsteen and Coldplay and I can safely say that the Dave Matthews Band have a well deserved reputation as the best live band in the world.  Their performance was so *tight*  It's really clear that they love the material, and love performing it even more.  They had 70,000+ people, (who had all been standing, crammed together on the lawn, for several hours) wanting more after the concert was over.  It was really just a tremendous show.  I would recommend it to not only a casual Dave Fan, but to anyone who loves great performances of good music.",1067472000,4,1296,4.5
1948107,5,B0000UQQTE,"While I am well aware that the DVD has not come out yet, I can give a review of the concert that it was filmed at. I was lucky enough to be at the AOL concert for Schools in Central Park and I am happy to report that the show was absolutely fantastic.
They played all the favorites including Warehouse, Crush, What Would You Say, Dancing Nancies, Don't Drink the Water, All Along the Watchtower and so many others during the concert which lasted almost 3 full hours.
The set design was nice and their production team deserves alot of credit for their work.  They do a tremendous job using the lighting to enhance the songs.
That's all nice but the absolutely best part about the concert is that the the Band was so *tight*  I have been to several different concerts including Bruce Springsteen, U2, and Coldplay, and I can safely say that DMB has a much deserved reputation as the best concert band in the world.  They put on the best live shows I have ever seen.  It was quite clear at this concert that they love the material, and love performing it even more.  The concert was full of energy that kept the crowd of 70,000+ standing in place for several hours,all crammed together, stuffed onto the Great lawn, wanting more when it was all over.
It was a tremendous show and I would recommend it to any one who is not only a casual Dave fan, but to anyone who is a fan of good music.  I promise that you will not be disappointed.",1067385600,3,1431,4.32089552238806

1948146,5,B0000UQQTE,"I have the Central Park Concert on my iPod but I wanted the DVD for my two year old. :) I can only hear ""Wheels on the Bus"" so many times. My husband and I are musicians and our son loves playing instruments. He bangs on the drum pads that go with our Wii (they're nice and quiet!). We have ""DMB The Videos 1994-2001"" but some of the videos are too creepy for a toddler. I chose this DVD because it only shows the band playing and I just skip over scary sounding songs (Don't Drink the Water). My toddler loves to watch Carter Beauford and will try to imitate him. Or he'll pull out his guitar and try to be Dave. This is definitely not a typical toddler purchase, but it's important to us that he gets exposure to GOOD music. If you like the CD set and just want to be able to watch the concert, this CD is perfect.",1396656000,3,816,4.04320987654321

1948149,5,B0000UQQTE,I bought this DVD 6 years ago! I still love it. It is just like being there.  I have had many friends watch it and become DMB fans.  It transforms people's opinion of DMB.  (Granted I watch and listen to it in a home theater with a 100 in high def. projector) The performance is so much more than the music. It grabs a piece of your soul and just doesn't let go! It's that good.,1390521600,,378,3.9473684210526314
1948150,4,B0000UQQTE,I was hoping it would be better than the Tim Reynolds cd but I wasn't. I personally like that cd a lot but this is good too.,1387843200,,124,3.6296296296296298

1948153,5,B0000UQQTE,"This concert DVD is one of the things that got me really into Dave.  All it took was this and seeing them one time live before I was hooked.  I recommend this to anybody who is curious about Dave or just wants to see what it's all about.  I usually always give this one to friends for them to see why I'm into DMB so much.

There is a great flow of the setlist, and there are enough of the classics to get someone up to speed on what the band is really known for.  I think each of the albums released to that point are all equally represented and all are played great.

I just can't wait for the day that this concert video, as well as the others, are released on Blu Ray",1386547200,,671,3.933333333333333

Honestly if you have anyone rate less than 5 stars then they do not feel the Love and truly not a fan! maybe if they listen to the words they would enjoy it...........Truly DMB is John Lennon""s spirit continuing through them............Peaceful, love, lyrics, encouraging to live happy together...........Love Them.",1367712000,,337,5.2592592592592595
1948159,5,B0000UQQTE,DMB is my favorite band.  I have all of their studio albums and about 40% of their live albums.  This is a great DVD concert with good quality surround sound.  Worth every penny and then some.  One of my favorite albums of theirs.,1365120000,,230,4.27906976744186

1948165,5,B0000UQQTE,"I never considered myself a big fan of Dave Matthews until I discovered this concert.  I got this dvd from Amazon just the other day and already I have found myself replaying parts of the concert, because you just cannot get enough of this amazing performance.  This dvd shows how incredibly talented the entire band is, particularly in that they are able to extend almost every song into a jam session that is so amazing no one could possibly find it boring.  What strikes me is they seem to never run out material to play, after all the concert was around 3 hours long.  Yet I found myself wanting more after the last song had played and the credits rolled.  Someone has to be good to have that effect.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has a true appreciation for real music, yes I said real music.  Go, ahead settle down for the evening and enjoy this one, or split it up into several evenings!",1338163200,2,898,4.406060606060606
1948166,5,B0000UQQTE,"What can I say that everyone else hasn't already said.  Dave is awesome LIVE and this show doesn't disappoint.  I remember listening to Dave Matthews bootleg cassette tapes in 1988 in our college dorms, being told, ""This guy in Virginia is really good.  We gotta go check him out sometime!""  Many of his followers have no idea that he's been pumping out great live shows for that long.  This Central Park show is a perfect example of what he has to offer - which is pure bliss for a jam band fan.  This show has the old saxophone player (who is killer in this show and every other show he ever played) and it also contains the one and only Mr. Warren MothaF*k*ng Haynes!!!  The hardest working guitarist in the world today.  He really shines on Cortez the Killer, as even Dave is even caught on camera looking back at the drummer, saying, ""He's f*king good"".  I highly recommend this show, as the sound is full and crisp from beginning to end and the video doesn't flip around too much like many other shows.",1334275200,2,1008,4.434782608695652
1948167,5,B0000UQQTE,"I saw DMB performing here in Italy in a small sport center, and it was a great concert. But seeing them in Central Park is really amazing.
All the DVD is great, but I think the highest moment is ""Cortez the Killer"" with Warren Haynes. That's unforgettable !!!",1332460800,,259,4.416666666666667

Got in touch with the people and they wanted me to send it back... with me paying for shiping. I paid for them to ship it to me, would have had to pay to ship it back... then shipping would have cost more than the dvd set! They listed it in excellent condition... probably will not buy from this vendor again, they are not real concerned with customer service! Be wary of how they label the condition of merchandise!!!!!!! Buyer Beware!",1314662400,,540,4.303921568627451
1948170,5,B0000UQQTE,"If you appreciate musicianship and real talent, you will not find a better band anywhere.  Each member is exceptionally talented in their own right and together they put on the best concert I've ever seen.  Clean professional sound all around and an energy that jumps off the screen.  I have a 58"" 3D TV and this concert was filmed with stunning quality.  I know I was able to appreciate the performance much more than were I crammed with 100,000 people in Central Park.  Having said that, it was the combination of DMB and the crowd made this such a very very special event.

1948175,5,B0000UQQTE,"This is a great 2 disc dvd of the Dave Matthews Band performing in New York's Central Park. I think this was filmed during 2003. Disc one consists of 11 great songs, and disc two consists of 9 great songs. Warren Haynes performs as a guest guitarist & vocalist on ""Cortez the Killer"" & ""Jimi Thing"" both on disc two.

The Dave Matthews Band are an outstanding ""outdoor"", ""Jam"" band. I've seen them perform live at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and they are really good. This concert dvd proves they are an outstanding ""outdoor - jam"" band. This is a great concert DVD, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!",1237852800,,617,4.508928571428571

1948179,5,B0000UQQTE,"The next best thing to attending a Dave Matthews Band concert is watching a good DVD of one - and this is the best I have seen so far...great assortment of tunes, the sound and video shots are terrific...and with the untimely passing of Leroi Moore during the summer of 2008, the shots of his magical performances are especially sweet....",1222560000,,338,4.65

I got my first taste of Dave Matthews in Warren Haynes Benefit Concert #8 DVD. FYI: Pick up a copy of this one too!

So, why did I pick up this title. I was bored and looking for some new material. Why was this a no-brainer?

1st - they had 90,000 ppl there.

2cd - just look at all the positive Amazon reviews.

3rd - 2:49 minutes of live concert. I'm sold. This title is going to get many replays.

What a treat. This title may be in my top three favorite purchases for 2008.

1948182,5,B0000UQQTE,My husband and I recently got into DMB and we absolutely love them. We first really saw them on Storytellers. Our 1 year old son just can't take his eyes off them. He dances and sings to them. Well that just melted our hearts. Nothing is like a LIVE Dave Matthews Band concert. We definitely recommend this one for sure. We chose this DVD base on another reviewers recommendation and we are EXTREMELY happy with our purchase. We've play it every evening since we received it. I hope you will also enjoy it. You won't be sorry.,1217116800,,526,4.43298969072165

It crucial parts to some songs, it would cut to the Empire State Building or the Brooklyn Bridge.

Very few get the honor of playing in the middle of a baseball diamond in the United States' largest and most famous park. Weather you like DMB or not, you will love this concert and very swiftly place it on your proudest shelf of your concert DVD collection. The production, the direction, the sound, and the extras are simply the best i've seen.  And to see DMB play a Neil Young cover (Cortez the Killer) with one of the greatest guitarists, and most decorated song writers in the world (Warren Haynes; Allman Brothers Band and Gov't Mule) is a landmark event in rock history that one would be sorry to have missed.

With that said the video quality of this concert is a bit inconsistent, on average I would say it's good - but far from great.

The sound quality is exceptionally good - well mixed.

The band itself - Spectacular, Amazing, Superb, etc...

This production is able to essentially bottle what was an enormous concert event so that it could be enjoyed over and over again.

I wish the production quality was up to the level of the performance, but it is better then most concert DVD's that I've seen (and I have seen many). The DVD format does have limitations, but this production falls short of the maximum potential.

I remember growing up, going through school, experimenting with DMB, and there was a backlash to it because of how quickly popular the band and their music became... but it is clear to me now, and this concert should silence all the critics, that they are truly a musical phenomenon that is unparalelled... No musical group can create the sound that they have imagined and built, for it's uniqueness, their musicianship, and their love for the music... they are legends.

Personally, Warehouse is my favorite performance of the show, but they are all effin' great.  They are a band that is meant to be experienced live, their studio albums do not do them justice, and if you couldn't see one of their greatest shows, this is the closest you will come, and it's daaaaaaaaamn close!",1197676800,2,926,4.78125

The songs thyat really stand out are All Along the Watchtower, Warehouse, and What you Are, and of course the classics like two step, ants marching ect. also the jams are amazing.

I popped the DMB central park concert into my laptop on a plane last night and almost jumped out of my seat screaming, dancing and smashing things cause it was so f-ing good!  I'm glad I used some self control because I'm sure I would have been arrested.
I lived in NYC for over a decade and saw just about every major concert on the great lawn.  None of them compared to this concert.  The sound, the musicianship, the lighting, the videography, the crowd, the interaction between band members; absolutely brilliant!
Every song was stretched into a jazzy/funky, vivid jam that bubbled up the whole gamut of emotions.  For example, ""All Along the Watchtower"" started with Stephan's very mello, psychedelic rendition of the star spangled banner but turned into this powerhouse song where Dave is screaming ""FIRE"" like he's standing on a wall somwhere, in the heat of battle, commanding his men to fight.  Made me think of the troops that fight or have fought for this country.
The whole band played very well, especially Carter.  I've never seen an octopus play the drums before.  Beautiful to watch.
If you like live music, you absolutely have to have this in your collection.  You will definitely be taken on a ride ... and it's an awesome, passionate ride.",1080864000,15,1385,4.694214876033058

I bought my first CD of DMB last week. But, within a week I just had to buy ALL the studio albums. I received the DVD yesterday and have already experienced the most enthralling numbers from their albums over and over again. Experienced, because this is sooo good, it feels like you're there.
The music is one of a kind, it's simply stated AMAZING, the sound is perfect and you get a fantastic view of DMB and all the fans in Central Park.
I'm sure there are a lot of DMB fans in Holland and I hope that we get the change to enjoy an astounding concert like this in future as well.

1948255,5,B0000UQQTE,"My friend and I went to a concert in LA this summer ('03 / Compton, CA) and the concert kicked ass. This is the only DMB concert that I've been to. I thought this is so damn awesome what could be better?
And then my friend buys this DVD. 2 Disks of DMB at it's best. Over 700,000 fans filled the 9 acres of Central Park making this Concert the largest concert of 2003. Yea, no kidding. I have not seen Live Performances bring in this many people except for the likes of Earth Wind & Fire, Genesis, Tower of Power, Sting, and Paul Simon.
Dave Matthews Band Kicks Ass. Period. No Bad right now is anywhere near this hot at live concerts, not one. They are the world's #1 Live Concert Band, period.
I only had a couple things that I did not like. #1 (just based on my personal opinion) JTR is the best live song and it was not played, and #2 The ""Making of the Concert"" or ""Behind the Scenes"" - whatever it is called - is only about 15 mins long. I was hoping for more behind the scenes documentary but I can't complain with the amount of songs that they had to cram onto both disks -- ITS AMAZING! (John Mayer actually did a commentary along with his live DVD and that was awesome. I wish Dave Matthews would do the same...but that would require maybe 4 disks~~)
I am glad that the ""singing sisters"" where not on hand in NY because they annoyed me in ""Live at Folsom Field.""
So to sum up, This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen in my life. When you see what 700+ thousand people look like you will be in awe. And watching them full-out sprint over 3 football field lengths just to get the best standing position was amazing! I wish I was there!!",1075075200,3,1650,4.1433021806853585
1948256,5,B0000UQQTE,"I heard about this concert DVD through my email newsletter subscription to the Dave Matthews Club. I ordered it over the Net before it was released and I was given a bonus live CD of other songs done in their other gigs which were not played in the DVD which makes for a spectacular bonus. I ended up paying more but I couldn't care less. Being from the Philippines where only DMB CDs are sold regularly, I couldn't resist the urge to buy this DVD, knowing it was more than 2 1/2 hours long. The music was great and of course the show was vintage DMB. Fans running to the stage in a mad frenzy to get the best spot of land in the Great Lawn. Wish I was there but this DVD made me come oh so close. I don't know about the following of DMB in our country, but the die hard fans I know of are always praying and hoping that the band will come around our part of the world in the future. Noot all bands can come even close to DMB in live performances. This is worth your money!",1074556800,10,973,4.020618556701031

1948259,5,B0000UQQTE,"I think this concert performance was done primarily to cease the rumors that, no, DMB are NOT breaking up (some people began to wonder because of Some Devil). Also, a great thing about DMB is that if you hear a song on one of their albums that you DON'T like (like about half of the material on Busted Stuff), somehow it doesn't matter when you hear it live because then it just sounds too damn good.
Of course the band performs plenty of great songs like ""Don't Drink The Water"", ""Too Much"" and, uh-hmmm, ""Ants Marching"". But they also do some lesser-known songs like ""Help Myself"" from the Scream 2 soundtrack. They even perform covers, like Neil Young's ""Cortez The Killer"". And although I would give them an ""A"" for effort for ""All Along The Watchtower"", I'm not sure I'd go as far as to say it's right up there with the original - after all, Dylan and Hendrix have pretty big shoes to fill.
All in all, DMB performs extremely well at this Central Park concert, and you can tell the audience is really feeling it. The band even looks like they're having fun while they're playing, which I think is important. Some people may be upset that ALL their favorites weren't played that night (no ""Space Between""???), but it was a great show regardless. It's so energetic that it almost makes you feel like you're AT it.
My suggestion is to pick up the DVD instead of the CD. Both are great, but live performances are better SEEN, don't you think?

On the advise of a friend I picked up this DVD and was impressed. The band rocked for the better part of three hours and while I was not real familiar with the set list looking at the copyright dates I presume I got music from throughout the career.
The highlights included  a version of ""Two Step"" to end the first disc and  and incredible ""Cortez the Killer"" and ""Jimi Thing"" that Warren Haynes sat in on.

With this praise, you're probably wondering why I didn't just slap on the 5 star rating.  I'll explain, and then I'll praise some more.  They didn't do ""Bartender"".  I saw/heard that song for the first time on the Folsom Field disc and it is the single most emotional experience I've ever had in front of a television (with the possible exeception of the first time I managed to unscramble the Playboy channel), and I hadn't bothered to look at the set list before sitting down to watch this show (it's DMB, all their songs are good), and was then a bit bummed when through all these...just...whoa!...great!...stupendous performances, they didn't do that one song that I wanted to see so much.
Oh well, despite this minor setback, the show kicks mighty buttock in both sound, picture, performance, editting, and yes I'm sure even the catering was legendary.

I like good jazz/rock music played as good live as in the studio. I'll give it 3 stars and update when I've seen it+++++++++++Well old Agy's right again. The first DVD didn't fully work. Had to replace it. But I listened to half the first disc and all the second disc. This is one stonking great live band. Never heard much of the DMB before but I'm going to from now on. This group really know how to play tight rock/jazz. The violin/sax/bass/acoustic mix really works well and is breath of fresh air compared to some of todays groups. On the second disc cortez the killer is the highlight which is hard to pick because its all so good. The lead guitar player, a chubby chappy, really knows how to play that track and almost equals NY's studio effort. This is one DVD that I'm glad I bought after reading other comments, and that don't happen often.",1072742400,,1025,4.428571428571429
1948267,5,B0000UQQTE,"This is without question the best DVD from DMB. This is the way forward - high definition video, DD5.1, 16:9 picture format and editing from someone who cares more about the viewer than their own arty agenda.
I love DMB, but not blindly. If I think something is crap then I will say so. This DVD is as near PERFECT as you can get. I know one could wish for certain extras such as subtitled lyrics or multi angles but this is only dressing.
I live in the UK, and as such DMB are not as well known as in the USA. When telling friends and spreading the DMB gospel I'm asked who they are. I always retort...... 'They produce music for GROWN-UPS.'
Just want to add that I thought 'Two Step' on 'Listener Supported' was tremendous, and it still is, but so is the arrangement of 'Two Step' on this Central Park DVD. It just goes to show how versatile DMB are.
Now Dave, no going back please. No more grainy video or 4:3 format.",1072742400,10,920,4.232954545454546
1948268,5,B0000UQQTE,"Even though Boyd's solo in Crush doesn't match in the DVD it is still awesome to see DMB rocking out in Central Park, I just wish I was there.  Anything by DMB is the bomb and I would buy anything by them before I even reviewed it or heard about it.  I love the Beatles and I know they are the best band ever, but The Dave Matthews Band is a close second.",1072656000,,355,3.8493150684931505
1948269,5,B0000UQQTE,"I was one of the lucky people to be at this concert back in September, and boy was it an amazing show.  Watching this DVD w/ surround sound brought me back to that night in Central Park.  The sound editing is excellent, and the video quality is superb. If I closed my eyes, it almost felt like I was back in Central Park, except for the thousands of bodies around me. A must have for all dave fans",1070841600,4,397,4.076923076923077
1948270,5,B0000UQQTE,"It is with great honor that I am allowed to review the latest and greatest installment from Dave Matthews Band. Having been a fan for the better part of 5 years and having been to like number of concerts, I can say that this DVD is damn near as good as the concert I was at in Phoenix 2 months prior. Dave and the boys have a lot more energy and are a little more animated in this show - but why not? Look at the gigundus crowd they're playing to!!! The setlist is fantastic and the sound and editing are near perfect.  I was totally blown away to see/hear 'Cortez, The Killer', 'Dancing Nancies', 'Where Are You Going' and 'Grey Street', and it threw me back, making me feel like I was at the concert all over again. I caught myself standing in my living room dancin' and bouncin' around in the middle of the night while watchin ths DVD. The only thing missing was a couple thousand more people and that certain 'smell' in the air that always comes with concerts.  I don't know what FREDs trip was, but majority rules, and pretty much everyone agrees that this is by far the best DMB DVD ever. Folsum was a disappointment and Listener Supported was my favorite - til now. It comes a close second of course. So Just go buy it. If you're a DMB fan you'll buy it anyway. If you're just curious, this is one helluva place to start.",1070668800,25,1328,4.24505928853755
1948271,5,B0000UQQTE,"For those of us who were not able to get to NYC for the concert, this DVD makes us feel even worse. It made me wish I could have ditched all my responsibilities and gone to Central Park! This DVD is absolutely amazing, I was cheering along just like the audience after each song. The extra footage is fun to watch. The music that night was just unbelievable. This is a must for all DMB fans.",1069632000,6,391,4.157894736842105
1948272,5,B0000UQQTE,"I knew that DMB was one of the best bands around...until now.  Before, I knew they had the stuff to become legends...but now I know they already are.  I own every CD and DVD they have released to date.  I was worried when I read that they were going to release the CD & DVD of the Central Park Concert, specially after the last DVD disappointed a little in terms of having been in full screen format with so many cuts that you could not really appreciate the band.  Besides, the performance offered nothing new other than presenting new material live.  But no so with this release.  I was so blown away by the band on this concert that I think its safe to say that these guys, at least in my book, now rank among the likes of Led Zeppelin, Rush, etc.  There is no new band nowadays that can touch them in terms of musicianship and virtuosity.  Their unique sound, their creativity...the arrangements of old classics.  Many bands sound good, but these guys are on a class of their own.  This has to be one of the best concert DVD's to date...and believe me, I own a few.  The performance is so outstanding that there are no words to really describe it.  I gave a bad review to their last DVD, but if I could give this one 1,000 stars I would.  Its just a shame that is not receiving the amount of acceptance as it truly deserves (in terms of sales I mean), but people will soon catch up.  The guy that convinced the band to film and release this concert in HD widescreen anamorphic video should be canonized.  The video is absolutely flawless doing justice to a legendary performance.  The sound is fantastic nonetheless.  If you own their other concert DVD's, you have to get this one.  It's THE one, and almost impossible to top.  If you don't own the other two releases, and plan to own only one...look no further.  Its worth every penny and more.",1069545600,12,1849,4.366568914956011
1948273,5,B0000UQQTE,"Best Concert DvD yet...starting with a great venue like central park, creates a magic in itself. you just know the band and crowd will be hyped as they are. The 5.1 surround sound is incredible, so life like. The whole concert was shot in HD (high definition) which makes everything so crystal clear. I love the editing, it keeps the focus mainly on the band, (not like folsum where there was too much cutting). The setlist is a fan's favorite of all there hits. i highly recommend this dvd for any music fan, not just a dmb fan. its almost 3 hours of great music. The band is at its best. Go Get this NOW!!",1069372800,4,607,4.28695652173913
1948274,5,B0000UQQTE,"Hot damn, the boys are rollin' on this DVD!!  This DVD blows the band's other two releases out of the water.  I love the shots were you see even the police officers gettin' funky.  How can you help yourself?!  The groove is just too contagious.  Rock n' Roll!",1069286400,2,259,4.3125
1948275,5,B0000UQQTE,"Much better than the Folsom Field DVD imho.  It captures the feel of the concert wonderfully and Dave is very animated during this concert.  Lots of long outros to songs and just a great feel all around on this DVD.  I would say this is better than Listener Supported, but I love the intimate feel of that DVD.  If you're even a remote fan of DMB, get this DVD!",1069286400,,361,4.188405797101449
1948276,5,B0000UQQTE,"Those of you who really liked Listener Supported and were disapointed by Live at Folsom Fields have nothing to fear here. This DVD is great. Well filmed, great sound, and, of course, the performance might be their best to be released on CD or DVD.",1069200000,2,247,4.511111111111111
