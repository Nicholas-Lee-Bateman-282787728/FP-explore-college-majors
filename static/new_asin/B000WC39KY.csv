2965626,3,B000WC39KY,"I just saw adverts on a few sites promoting that there is another American Pie movie out.. usually I would be sick of these things by now, but after the last one (Naked Mile) I knew it was still going strong, and I picked it up right away.

In Naked Mile it's about another Stiffler who is being shown around the college campus to see what college life is like. Now, they are in college, and the Stiffler cousins return and do their pledges to become BETA's... soon after they end up taking on the Geek House in an Olympiad.

It kind of made me think of ""Revenge Of The Nerds"", only the situation has been turned around and it's the geeks that are making the trouble trying to rid the BETA's of their house.

With that said, it has more of a plot then the last movie, but hey, these movies are just for fun, they're to make you laugh, and this one certainly does not disappoint when it comes to shock value laughter, And this one certainly has a few great shock value moments.

About the only thing they could have improved on was more of the Olympiad games... they said it was banned, yet nothing seemed too over the top or perverted... not for what these movies could be coming up with.

Still, Overall, part 6 is far from the weakest of the series, and I will be looking out for a part 7 if it comes to be.

Plus; it could use some bonus features, and I miss the hot midget from part 5, bring her back for #7.",1198713600,2,1412,4.153846153846154

2965628,4,B000WC39KY,"I have to admit, I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of those gag-a-minute films, just loaded with wall to wall jokes. Some miss, many hit, and overall the movie is lighthearted, silly, and of course absurdly raunchy. There are probably more naked bodies and bodily fluids than I've ever seen in a movie (or elsewhere, for that matter). If you're partial to the Merchant-Ivory films, this is probably not the movie for ya.",1198540800,,424,4.743243243243243
2965629,4,B000WC39KY,"First the warning and some quick intro here.  If you are bothered at all by crude humor, look elsewhere.  Like The Naked Mile, this movie goes for crude humor and plenty of gratituitous skin in what some would consider inappropriate areas.  If you aren't looking for that type of movie, look elsewhere fast.  As I wrote about The Naked Mile, this isn't golden globe or academy award calibre type stuff and you should know that going in.  Complaining about the lack of taste in these movies is just a sign of ignorance of the product.

With that said comes this WARNING -- this particular movie includes or implies depiction of beastiality and a later simulated scene of same, so even those that aren't easily offended may find this movie takes things more than just a bit too far.  END OF WARNING.

The humor is low brow, revolves around sexual exploits and college partying (alcohol and sex mostly) and mostly offers up excuses to show skin, skin and more skin...  In doing so there's a fair amount of laughs and fun and if you aren't too uptight or too disgusted by the material from the warning above, then you might find this movie entertaining.  Just go in with the right attitude to start :-)",1198454400,20,1198,4.582159624413146

2965717,4,B000WC39KY,"Beta House is one of the DVDs that I bought on Black Friday at my local Walmart for a $1.96, which is the third entry in the American Pie Present franchise. As with any American Pie movie, this movie is raunchy with full frontal female nudity, graphic language, strong sexual content and gross out humor.

Of course Eugene Levy returns as Noah Levenstein.

The plot is a mix of Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and Old School, only this time it is reversed as the nerds have the popular fraternity and the jocks have the poor fraternity.

I actually ended up liking Beta House even though it was raunchy.

The only thing I did not like were the two vomit scenes. Especially the ""group vomit fight"" is quite discusting.

Make sure to buy the unrated version in order to get the full frontal nuditiy!",1276646400,7,352,4.571428571428571
2965732,4,B000WC39KY,"OK, first off let me start off by saying no american pie sequels/successor movies will ever be as good as the first 3 until they can bring back Sean ""William"" Scott as Steve Stiffer which lets face the facts will sadly likely never happen especially after Teen People Magazine wrote an article about him titled ""Professional Jerk"".

Now with that being said this movie was pretty good, better then the last sequel/successor movie to the American pie series titled ""The Naked Mile"".  I think the guys who made this movie did an excellent job with it not making it too much like the last pie movie by taking out certain characters, groups of characters, and places such as Eric Stiffler's high school sweet heart Tracy and the vertically challenged fraternity house even though Rock and his brother do have a small scene in the movie with Dwight Stiffler. And replacing Tracy with a new girl Eric Stiffler falls in love with who is 10 times hotter named Ashley and a Geek house that this time instead of beating up Dwight Stiffler does a bunch of stuff to his house when he is present to piss him off such as shutting down one of their parties by cutting his house's power supply and taking all their alcohol.  However there is one thing that I think would have made the movie better.  In the end of the movie the Geek fraternity house challenges the Beta House to a greek games event that has been banned from colleges (well at least theirs) for years and well when the event goes into sudden death OT I think the last challenge between the 2 houses would have turned out better if at the end they had Rock come out in the sheep suit instead of who they had from the Beta house.  And I can't tell you the significance of the sheep suit the Beta's use against the Geek house or why they use it against the geek house because that would spoil the movie.  Plus I only saw this film on comedy central so I'm sure the uncut version is at least 10 times funnier but still not as good as any one of the first 3 American Pie Movies.  Also something worthy of noting is that Eric Stifflers Parents are back in this movie along with his friend Bobby who falls in love with Ashely's room mate from Georgia in the movie and of course Dwight Stiffler's tag along buddy from the last American pie movie Bull then you get a new hilarious Beta introduced as the rush chair of the house named Wesley and some funny fat kid who is one of Eric Stiffler's 2 room mated in the film.

PS.
Eugine Levy returns as Jim Levensteans dad, has the best roll he has ever had in this movie and did a better job acting in this movie then any of the previous 5 Pie movies.",1275782400,,2638,4.325910931174089

I enjoyed this movie - so why a 3 out of 5? Well, the movie was badly edited. You can tell that the final product was not what was originally written, and they changed or cut out parts.

Theres a trailer showing the midget frat playing football - thats not in the movie. You can also tell from certain scenes that the lady from the greek frat was going to betray the geek house, but that never happened which made certain scenes seem a bit out of place.

Now if you want to go into this movie expecting not much except maybe for a few laughs here and there, maybe some crude humor, and maybe some naked girl, then you'll get it here.

I bought the movie on a whim since I own the others and I'll own them all probably if they keep coming out. They aren't the best things out there, but I get a few laughs from them. I watched Beta House with 2 other guys, and then took it to our recreation tent and watched it with about 8 other guys and we all enjoyed it. Some scenes I laughed pretty hard at (the leg burn comes to mind). The plot is pretty out there and I could care less really. I just want to see the crude humor and I got it. I would consider this a decent 'lets drink some beers and watch something stupid' movie.

Two big things about this movie that I'm sure you've read in the reviews is

1. Lots and lots of boobs. There was a ton of nudity...even I was surprised.

2. I need to go to college. I had no clue you didn't have to go to school while in college. I also didn't know you could shoot water balloons at girls in white t-shirts and then they would just start laughing and looking around in horny happiness. No uglies at college either!

I think one of worst parts about this movie (I'm sure many of you can think of others, but like I said, I didn't think the movie was that bad) was the use of one of the characters in the Beta House. I cant remember his name, but he was actually a very nice and polite guy, until he got beer or liqour in him. Then he became a wild party animal. I liked the fact that we never actually saw him being crazy (except for once on video tape) but only saw the outcome. I would've liked to had seen more of this guys adventure finales. But ah well.

Too much skin and frontal nudity of gorgeous babes.  Senseless plot.  The rivalry between the Betas and the Geeks somehow was a rehash of Revenge of the Nerds.

2965757,3,B000WC39KY,"Jack Valente (head of the MPAA) is right now... trying to figure out a way to regulate these UNRATED DVDs more strictly.... thanks to AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE. In a lot of ways, I respect AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE for having the balls to do such an in your face, sexually frank movie. I also respect them for actually getting such attractive GIRLS to do such DIRTY things. On the other hand, I know that AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE will be the catalyst for the inevitable end of UNRATED, UNREGULATED DVDs.

First of all, of course, the story is ridiculous... cliche' fraternity BS. There's the pledges. The hazing. The tasks to complete. The competition between the frats for superiority. Think ANIMAL HOUSE without the laughs, charm, originality or the reality. Where ANIMAL HOUSE managed to capture some reality amid the madness, BETA HOUSE captures a lot of VD and crams a lot of fantasy and myth into its alloted time. Oh, all the women are hot at college and all the women are ready to strip for you, always and anywhere.

Thankfully, within the first 5 minutes, you are warned. It's like walking in on your parents having sex when Erik Stifler (John White) moves into his dorm room, only to find his chubby roommate being ridden by his equally chubby girlfriend... casually making friends, shaking hands and having a conversation the entire time.

If your offended there. Don't go any further. If you let your teens buy it, thinking that it was just some harmless sex jokes... well... put it this way: You may not have to have that painful sex talk with your kid anymore, but your kid may also be scarred for life with unrealistic expectations that the girls at school are going to give him a lap dance when he asks for it or that all girls are GIRLS GONE WILD.

Seriously, the only thing noteable about the film is the ""in your face"" sexual frankness. I'm 37 years old. I appreciate the female form as much as the next guy and the fact that the creators of AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE recruited such attractive girls to look at like, Meghan Heffern, Sarah Power, Ashleigh & Tiffany Hubbard, Angela Besharah, Julia Schneider and Ace Hicks (I know... who? But they are hot). Yet, even I was surprised at the full nudity in the first 5 minutes... twice... and the male ejaculation thrown into the camera or the full-fledged FEMALE ejaculation... or the beastiality.

The movie is bad. It isn't funny. Yet, I give it 3 stars for the sheer fact that it will be a noteable movie for film history. Because this is the day... the release date of this movie on DVD was the day that the MPAA started looking for a way to stop or regulate the UNRATED DVD craze.

The boundaries weren't tested with AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE... THEY WERE SHATTERED.",1198972800,3,2735,4.594262295081967
2965758,1,B000WC39KY,"I'm no prude. I love sex in movies, toilet humor, farting; the whole shebang. I loved the first AP, the second was good too. The third, not bad. But this! This is nothing but 90 minutes of soft porn, orgasms flying through the air, bestiality and just about anything else you can think of.

All the sex, in and of itself, save for the bestiality, is fine. But if I was in the mood to watch that, I would have rented a porn. Why it ended up in an AP movie is beyond me.

Is the writer and director so lame, that all they could do was throw sex scene after sex scene in it????

The soul of American Pie was annihilated in this garbage film. No wonder the original cast won't have anything to do with it. It would ruin their careers.",1198713600,6,730,4.090909090909091
3200123,3,B000WC39KY,"I just saw adverts on a few sites promoting that there is another American Pie movie out.. usually I would be sick of these things by now, but after the last one (Naked Mile) I knew it was still going strong, and I picked it up right away.

In Naked Mile it's about another Stiffler who is being shown around the college campus to see what college life is like. Now, they are in college, and the Stiffler cousins return and do their pledges to become BETA's... soon after they end up taking on the Geek House in an Olympiad.

It kind of made me think of ""Revenge Of The Nerds"", only the situation has been turned around and it's the geeks that are making the trouble trying to rid the BETA's of their house.

With that said, it has more of a plot then the last movie, but hey, these movies are just for fun, they're to make you laugh, and this one certainly does not disappoint when it comes to shock value laughter, And this one certainly has a few great shock value moments.

About the only thing they could have improved on was more of the Olympiad games... they said it was banned, yet nothing seemed too over the top or perverted... not for what these movies could be coming up with.

Still, Overall, part 6 is far from the weakest of the series, and I will be looking out for a part 7 if it comes to be.

Plus; it could use some bonus features, and I miss the hot midget from part 5, bring her back for #7.",1198713600,2,1412,4.153846153846154

Some miss, many hit, and overall the movie is lighthearted, silly, and of course absurdly raunchy. There are probably more naked bodies and bodily fluids than I've ever seen in a movie (or elsewhere, for that matter). If you're partial to the Merchant-Ivory films, this is probably not the movie for ya.",1198540800,,424,4.743243243243243
3200126,4,B000WC39KY,"First the warning and some quick intro here.  If you are bothered at all by crude humor, look elsewhere.  Like The Naked Mile, this movie goes for crude humor and plenty of gratituitous skin in what some would consider inappropriate areas.  If you aren't looking for that type of movie, look elsewhere fast.  As I wrote about The Naked Mile, this isn't golden globe or academy award calibre type stuff and you should know that going in.  Complaining about the lack of taste in these movies is just a sign of ignorance of the product.

With that said comes this WARNING -- this particular movie includes or implies depiction of beastiality and a later simulated scene of same, so even those that aren't easily offended may find this movie takes things more than just a bit too far.  END OF WARNING.

The humor is low brow, revolves around sexual exploits and college partying (alcohol and sex mostly) and mostly offers up excuses to show skin, skin and more skin...  In doing so there's a fair amount of laughs and fun and if you aren't too uptight or too disgusted by the material from the warning above, then you might find this movie entertaining.  Just go in with the right attitude to start :-)",1198454400,20,1198,4.582159624413146

Of course Eugene Levy returns as Noah Levenstein.

The plot is a mix of Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and Old School, only this time it is reversed as the nerds have the popular fraternity and the jocks have the poor fraternity.

3200229,4,B000WC39KY,"OK, first off let me start off by saying no american pie sequels/successor movies will ever be as good as the first 3 until they can bring back Sean ""William"" Scott as Steve Stiffer which lets face the facts will sadly likely never happen especially after Teen People Magazine wrote an article about him titled ""Professional Jerk"".

Now with that being said this movie was pretty good, better then the last sequel/successor movie to the American pie series titled ""The Naked Mile"".  I think the guys who made this movie did an excellent job with it not making it too much like the last pie movie by taking out certain characters, groups of characters, and places such as Eric Stiffler's high school sweet heart Tracy and the vertically challenged fraternity house even though Rock and his brother do have a small scene in the movie with Dwight Stiffler. And replacing Tracy with a new girl Eric Stiffler falls in love with who is 10 times hotter named Ashley and a Geek house that this time instead of beating up Dwight Stiffler does a bunch of stuff to his house when he is present to piss him off such as shutting down one of their parties by cutting his house's power supply and taking all their alcohol.  However there is one thing that I think would have made the movie better.  In the end of the movie the Geek fraternity house challenges the Beta House to a greek games event that has been banned from colleges (well at least theirs) for years and well when the event goes into sudden death OT I think the last challenge between the 2 houses would have turned out better if at the end they had Rock come out in the sheep suit instead of who they had from the Beta house.  And I can't tell you the significance of the sheep suit the Beta's use against the Geek house or why they use it against the geek house because that would spoil the movie.  Plus I only saw this film on comedy central so I'm sure the uncut version is at least 10 times funnier but still not as good as any one of the first 3 American Pie Movies.  Also something worthy of noting is that Eric Stifflers Parents are back in this movie along with his friend Bobby who falls in love with Ashely's room mate from Georgia in the movie and of course Dwight Stiffler's tag along buddy from the last American pie movie Bull then you get a new hilarious Beta introduced as the rush chair of the house named Wesley and some funny fat kid who is one of Eric Stiffler's 2 room mated in the film.

I enjoyed this movie - so why a 3 out of 5? Well, the movie was badly edited. You can tell that the final product was not what was originally written, and they changed or cut out parts.

Theres a trailer showing the midget frat playing football - thats not in the movie. You can also tell from certain scenes that the lady from the greek frat was going to betray the geek house, but that never happened which made certain scenes seem a bit out of place.

Now if you want to go into this movie expecting not much except maybe for a few laughs here and there, maybe some crude humor, and maybe some naked girl, then you'll get it here.

I bought the movie on a whim since I own the others and I'll own them all probably if they keep coming out. They aren't the best things out there, but I get a few laughs from them. I watched Beta House with 2 other guys, and then took it to our recreation tent and watched it with about 8 other guys and we all enjoyed it. Some scenes I laughed pretty hard at (the leg burn comes to mind). The plot is pretty out there and I could care less really. I just want to see the crude humor and I got it. I would consider this a decent 'lets drink some beers and watch something stupid' movie.

Two big things about this movie that I'm sure you've read in the reviews is

1. Lots and lots of boobs. There was a ton of nudity...even I was surprised.

2. I need to go to college. I had no clue you didn't have to go to school while in college. I also didn't know you could shoot water balloons at girls in white t-shirts and then they would just start laughing and looking around in horny happiness. No uglies at college either!

I think one of worst parts about this movie (I'm sure many of you can think of others, but like I said, I didn't think the movie was that bad) was the use of one of the characters in the Beta House. I cant remember his name, but he was actually a very nice and polite guy, until he got beer or liqour in him. Then he became a wild party animal. I liked the fact that we never actually saw him being crazy (except for once on video tape) but only saw the outcome. I would've liked to had seen more of this guys adventure finales. But ah well.

This along with it's predecessor is just an excuse for rauncy humor and a way to keep the silicone industry in business.",1199145600,2,490,4.180851063829787
3200253,4,B000WC39KY,"Good movie. I like it. This movie has a lot of funny parts and scenes despite some of them are sexy. For the acting, they are good since it is a reunite from the naked mile. For the direction, it is all good. The visuals are well as well. Therefore, a nice movie.",1199059200,,263,3.981132075471698
3200254,3,B000WC39KY,"Jack Valente (head of the MPAA) is right now... trying to figure out a way to regulate these UNRATED DVDs more strictly.... thanks to AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE. In a lot of ways, I respect AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE for having the balls to do such an in your face, sexually frank movie. I also respect them for actually getting such attractive GIRLS to do such DIRTY things. On the other hand, I know that AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE will be the catalyst for the inevitable end of UNRATED, UNREGULATED DVDs.

First of all, of course, the story is ridiculous... cliche' fraternity BS. There's the pledges. The hazing. The tasks to complete. The competition between the frats for superiority. Think ANIMAL HOUSE without the laughs, charm, originality or the reality. Where ANIMAL HOUSE managed to capture some reality amid the madness, BETA HOUSE captures a lot of VD and crams a lot of fantasy and myth into its alloted time. Oh, all the women are hot at college and all the women are ready to strip for you, always and anywhere.

Thankfully, within the first 5 minutes, you are warned. It's like walking in on your parents having sex when Erik Stifler (John White) moves into his dorm room, only to find his chubby roommate being ridden by his equally chubby girlfriend... casually making friends, shaking hands and having a conversation the entire time.

If your offended there. Don't go any further. If you let your teens buy it, thinking that it was just some harmless sex jokes... well... put it this way: You may not have to have that painful sex talk with your kid anymore, but your kid may also be scarred for life with unrealistic expectations that the girls at school are going to give him a lap dance when he asks for it or that all girls are GIRLS GONE WILD.

Seriously, the only thing noteable about the film is the ""in your face"" sexual frankness. I'm 37 years old. I appreciate the female form as much as the next guy and the fact that the creators of AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE recruited such attractive girls to look at like, Meghan Heffern, Sarah Power, Ashleigh & Tiffany Hubbard, Angela Besharah, Julia Schneider and Ace Hicks (I know... who? But they are hot). Yet, even I was surprised at the full nudity in the first 5 minutes... twice... and the male ejaculation thrown into the camera or the full-fledged FEMALE ejaculation... or the beastiality.

The movie is bad. It isn't funny. Yet, I give it 3 stars for the sheer fact that it will be a noteable movie for film history. Because this is the day... the release date of this movie on DVD was the day that the MPAA started looking for a way to stop or regulate the UNRATED DVD craze.

The boundaries weren't tested with AMERICAN PIE: BETA HOUSE... THEY WERE SHATTERED.",1198972800,3,2735,4.594262295081967
3200255,1,B000WC39KY,"I'm no prude. I love sex in movies, toilet humor, farting; the whole shebang. I loved the first AP, the second was good too. The third, not bad. But this! This is nothing but 90 minutes of soft porn, orgasms flying through the air, bestiality and just about anything else you can think of.

All the sex, in and of itself, save for the bestiality, is fine. But if I was in the mood to watch that, I would have rented a porn. Why it ended up in an AP movie is beyond me.

Is the writer and director so lame, that all they could do was throw sex scene after sex scene in it????

The soul of American Pie was annihilated in this garbage film. No wonder the original cast won't have anything to do with it. It would ruin their careers.",1198713600,6,730,4.090909090909091
