560771,5,6303038719,"1950's D.O.A. is classic film noir, one of the true classics of the genre.  The characters are intense, everyone is up to something, and the clock is ticking for one Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien), who must attempt to find his own murderer before his last grain of sand trickles to the bottom of the hourglass.  Bigelow is an accountant who up and takes a week off to visit San Francisco, ostensibly to get away from his secretary and incredibly needy, codependent, marathon-talking girlfriend Paula (Pamela Britton).  Once he arrives at the hotel, he's like an elephant in a peanut factory, trying to go every direction at once in order to have a good time with every woman he sees.  While the neurotic Paula broods, Bigelow goes out to paint the town red with a gang of his hotel neighbors, only to wake up the next morning feeling less than healthy.  A trip to the doctor's office instantly changes his entire perspective on life, for he finds out that he has been poisoned with a luminous toxin, for which there is no cure whatsoever.  With anywhere from a day to two weeks to live, he starts off on a relentless quest to discover his murderer.  The plot takes a number of twists and turns, and it can get a little confusing at times because of all the characters and all the shenanigans each of them are pulling.  Bigelow has nothing to lose, though, and he refuses to give up as long as he has a breath left in his body.

D.O.A. starts off a little slow, and the fact that a silly musical wolf call greeted the appearance of any woman early on had me doubting the merits of this film, but when things really get going, they really get going.  The action and suspense build inexorably with each passing minute of the film, and the background music only reinforces the gripping effect upon the viewer.  The camera work is also quite effective, strongly conveying the increasing alienation Bigelow is faced with as the Grim Reaper makes plans to pay him an imminent visit.  It is easy to become mesmerized by all of the story's twists and turns, as on top of the great atmosphere, you have to think about each new clue and surprise that Bigelow encounters on his mission.  You have to admire Bigelow's relentless determination and quick-thinking mind, and he quickly transforms himself from a character of dubious merit and possibly ignoble feelings into a tragic hero/victim of classic proportions.  If the whole luminous poisoning thing doesn't make you sympathize with the character, the neurotically suffocating burden of love he has to deal with continuously from Paula will.  Other films have taken this idea of a poisoned man hunting down his murderer in his dying days and hours, but none has produced such a gritty tale that drips with realism and builds to the type of crescendo found in this remarkable film noir classic.",1064534400,26,2835,4.6875
560772,5,6303038719,"This epic 1949 noir thriller, one of the greatest on film, involves the ultimate oxymoron, that of solving your own murder.  While seemingly contradictory to the ear, the solid premise makes sense within its own context.  Edmond O'Brien, cast as Banning accountant Frank Bigelow, is slipped a fatal dose of luminous toxic poison, finding out too late to save his life but with just enough time ticking on the clock to solve his own murder.  By the end of the film he is staggering, stubbornly seeking to endure long enough to put the finishing touches on his detective work.
The fatal act occurs not in his hometown just northwest of ritzy Palm Springs, but in San Francisco, where O'Brien, to use his own words, knows ""not one soul.""  He takes the trip to determine ultimately, after one painful divorce, if his secretary Paula Gibson, played by Pamela Britton, is truly right for him.  Britton begs O'Brien to take her with him, but ultimately she realizes that he needs the experiment to convince himself that their romance is meant to endure.  After one night on the town O'Brien realizes that he loves Paula and he has no more wild oats to sow, but his realization comes too late.  In the interim, while visiting The Fisherman, a jazz nightclub on The Wharf, he is slipped luminous toxic poison by a mysterious man with a hat and scarf, who stays just long enough to switch drinks with his victim.
O'Brien has a funny feeling in his stomach the following morning and checks out his condition, learning that he has ingested a fatal dose of luminous toxic poison.  Had he found out in time his life could have been spared with a stomach wash.
After initially reeling from the shocking disclosure, and after running down crowded Market Street like a man totally lost, O'Brien collects his thoughts and decides to solve his own murder before dying.  He is told that he may have no more than one day to live.  As it turns out, that is all the time that remains for him.
O'Brien's first clue is provided by Britton, who phones him to reveal that a Los Angeles export-import operator named Phillips has been eager to reach him.  When she telephones Phillips' office again, she learns that the businessman has died in the interim.  This convinces O'Brien that he needs to travel quickly to Los Angeles, where he hopes to find the necessary answers to ultimately solve his own murder.
Ultimately O'Brien learns that he has been poisoned because he happened to notarize a bill of sale for an order of iridium, which was stolen.  Luther Adler plays a ruthless mob boss who initially sold the iridium to Phillips, then bought it back, after which the facts became known and Phillips was arrested.  In the center of the action is femme fatale Laurette Luez, a beautiful young model who used his charms to get Phillips to buy the iridium.
The plot twists and turns soar at breakneck speed with the clock constantly ticking for O'Brien.  At one point he looks as good as dead after Adler turns him over to his would be executioner, psychopathic killer Neville Brand, a sadist who enjoys torturing O'Brien by slugging him in the belly, then reciting in a crazed mantra, ""Soft in the belly, he can't take it, he's soft in the belly!""  One fast move ultimately gets O'Brien out of harm's path as Brand is gunned down in the Hollywood drugstore O'Brien has entered to escape from the gun wielding executioner.
Eventually,with not an extra moment to spare, O'Brien is able to dispose of his killer.  From there he is just able to make it to police headquarters in downtown Los Angeles and tell his amazing story, after which he collapses on the floor.  The homicide boss tells the officer to make out the report on O'Brien as ""Dead on Arrival,"" in police shorthand ""D.O.A.""
The camera work, editing, and direction are superb.  Veteran cinematographer Ernest Laszlo did a first rate job, as did Rudolph Mate, the former cinematographer who made Rita Hayworth look so desirable in ""Gilda,"" who was making his directorial debut.  Oscar-winning musical composer Dimitri Tiomkin delivered pulse-beating music in concert with the swift pace of the film.  Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse, who would later found Seven Arts, delivered a superb script.  As for the cast, not a beat was missed.  This might well be O'Brien's top acting effort in a leading role.  He secured a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""The Barefoot Contessa"" starring Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, playing nervous, perpetually sweating publicist Oscar Muldoon.",1016841600,8,4512,4.792258064516129
560773,5,6303038719,D.O.A. starts off with one hell of a bang a hulky and overwhelmed Edmund O'Brien musters his way into a ploice station. As h emakes his way through the marble paved floors and pass the columns and the passage ways he finally arrives at the end of his journey. The journey to get him there is one that is so tight and compelling that when O'Brien announces that he has already been murdered the film turns into to a stark tail of death and lust told in flashback! O'Brien is Frank Bigelow an accountant who takes a trip to forget about his lover and just have a casual afair or two while in San Francisco. While in San Francisco heh finds a few hot ladies at his hotel and then he is whisked away to a Jazz club where he is poisoned and there isn't as antidote! the film moves ahead at whiplash speed from here. Shadows are cast over O'Briens hulking frame and sweat pours over his brow as he begins his trek to find his killer. th eplot and dialogue is as tight as any top grade Noir. But the most shoking element of the whole film is O'Brien he never once lets the viewer down he follows through with pure human emotion and if it seems like he is over actingn to some he is just playing a real life scenario oout on screen if you wer just poisoned would you be calm! Excellent Noir's have all the elements of the past from the sharp cut suits to the sheen of the telephones and with D.O.A. O'Brien seems to make all these elements seem ever more stark and fleeting with the fact that O'Brien is dying his precious reunion with the love he left for a good time seems more like fate instead of like the last time he will be in complete bliss! O'Brein is so powerful and commanding that i nver wanted him to die even though i knew it was inevitable now that makes the film as a whole a masterpiece!,1001721600,12,1796,4.178674351585014
560774,5,6303038719,"D.O.A. is quintessential 1950's film noir (though it was shot in 1949) and in my opinion the best of the genre. Everything about this film is done right, from it's casting, to acting, to cinematography to musical score to directing.... It is wonderful.
Edmund O'Brien plays Frank Bigelow a CPA who has been given a lethal dose of a poison and doesn't have long to live (a few days, a week tops). He doesn't know who slipped him this deadly mickey or why, but he's determined to find out. At the beginning of the film Frank walks into the LAPD to announce that he wants to report a murder. When the police captain ask who has been murdered Bigelow replies ""I was"" and then his story unfolds in flashback. When Bigelow begins his tale a couple of reporters and police detectives enter the room. By the end of the picture the room is filled to capacity with reporters and detectives completely enthralled in his story and hanging on to every word. By the time Frank ends his tale the slow acting poison takes deadly effect and he stands and croaks out his final gasp (his girlfriends name) and collapses to the floor. The men in the room, whose faces are filled with concern and admiration, all jump to their feet and rush to him only to announce that he is dead. You can't help but admire the guy, here's a guy who was intentionally poisoned and only had a few days to live and instead of wallowing in self pity and despair he went out and found his killer and got revenge (and saved another man's life along the way).
Characteristics of film noir, 1.) Everybody's got an angle even the minor characters. And do they all in D.O.A., everybody's got an angle even those not involved in Frank Bigelow's dilemma. That's what I love about film noir, no one is on the up and up. The 2nd characteristic of film noir; hoods, lots of hoods and this film is filled with them. What's so wonderful about this film is that even though Frank Bigelow is a respected CPA he looks, acts and talks like a hood. Frank wears the dark squared shouldered 50's suit like the best of hoodlums; he handles a gun and his fist like a hood. The ruggedly handsome Frank is a babe magnet and even though he is suppose to be in a committed relationship he can't keep his eyes and hands off other women...this CPA is a wolf in hood clothing and you can't help but like him.
Casting Edmond O'Brien as Frank Bigelow was a brilliant idea, he is the quintessential 50's film noir man, handsome, rugged, dark and tough. The only other person who could possibly have pulled off the role of Frank Bigelow is Raymond Burr (Perry Mason) as he has the same physical characteristics. In a word O'Brien is dramatic, when he is told by two doctors that he has been poisoned and will die in a few days (1 week tops), he springs to his feet, calls the doctor crazy and incompetent and runs from the office. With despair and disbelief written on his face Frank Bigelow runs, and runs and runs as if trying to run from the inevitable. Finally the realization sets in and he stops running and the look of despair is replaced by another look....determination and Frank has now accepted his fate and is now on a mission, a mission to find his killer before he dies.
From the opening credits you are involved in this film. Dimitri Tiomkin's brilliant score pulls you in with every thunderously dramatic musical step that Frank Bigelow takes to the police Captains office. You remain engaged with this picture from opening credits to final credits, enthralled you find yourself hoping that maybe some miracle will occur and Frank won't die and then you realize that Frank Bigelow has accepted his fate and you are the one in denial. In D.O.A. director Rudolph Mate delivers first rate film noir full of action mystery and suspense. Every scene is memorable and the cast is excellent as the director pushes them to deliver deadpan high drama performances. You'll love when the doc who told Bigelow that he'd been poisoned states in an ultra dramatic way, ""You don't fully understand, you've been murdered."" (Insert Dimitri Tiomkin's dramatic music here). Or the police Captain when asked how to fill out the report on Bigelow turns toward the camera with his stone face and replies ""file it as dead on arrival"" and there you have the movies title, D.O.A., excellent film.",998870400,3,4314,4.560567010309279
560775,5,6303038719,"Forget the misbegotten remake. This original version is the ultimate Late, Late Show. Somebody has killed Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) with slow -acting poison. Now he has only hours to find out who and why. An ultimate in urban paranoia, the movie would not work nearly so well without its strong sense of background normalcy. The love scenes may be sappy, but it's that middle-class ethos that lends the chaotic urban world Bigelow enters its uncommon vitality. Remakes of such noir classics as DOA are foredoomed by this post-Vietnam loss of background, while masters such as Hitchcock. understood that images of horror only emerge out of the depths of the ordinary.

The movie benefits greatly from O'Brien's high energy performance, as he charges non-stop through on-location labyrinths that criss-cross the urban landscape. It's a sweaty result, but enough to place his character in the Noir Hall of Fame. Right up there too, is the movie's high point: the jazz club. What burst of demonic energy and inspired editing brought this little gem to the screen. Rarely have bedlam, booze and casual sex mixed so expertly that the contents spill metaphorically across the remaining scenes, creating the necessary sense that anything is possible in a chaotic world. It must be seen to be appreciated.

Somehow, someway, a batch of mediocre careers got together and produced out of pure B-movie grist an unforgettable parable of the urban vortex, that grips even a half-century later. Don't miss it. It's the stuff nightmares are made of.",990921600,4,1538,5.099206349206349

560983,5,6303038719,"The film, noir ""D.O.A."" received unenthusiastic reviews upon its release in 1950.  With the passage of time, the film's reputation increased until it became regarded as a noir classic.  In 2004, the film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as ""historically, culturally, or aesthetically significant.""

""D.O.A."" tells the story of  Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) who has been murdered by poison. When doctors tell Bigelow he has only days to live, he sets out on a frantic, determined course to find his killer.

Bigelow's life becomes meaningful only when he faces the certainty of his impending death. He had been  an accountant in a small town who drank heavily and was a womanizer, flirting incessantly with whatever pretty woman came his way.  He had a lovely lady friend, Paula, (Pamela Britton) but was unsure of his feelings for her.  When Bigelow took a vacation to San Francisco to drink and flirt, he was poisoned. He realized at last his feelings for Paula and he found meaning in determining and finding his killer before he died.

The story of the murder, the motive, and Bigelow's investigation is told frenetically as befitting a person on the verge of dying and in a sense already dead.. The main attractions of the film are the cinematography, the development of the primary character, and the tough acting. The film features a long group of villains in addition to the killers.

The story is told as a flashback as, in the opening scene, Bigelow walks down the long cold hallway of the Los Angeles police station to report his own murder. This opening scene is famous as is the scene in a San Francisco jazz club called the Fishermen. This is where Bigelow meets his doom, but the film also offers an early view of the ""bop"" driving jazz culture that was part of the Beat movement at the time. The cinematography also features angular scenes of San Francisco and Los Angeles streets, gangster hideaways, and bars.

The film is based on an original screenplay by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene.  It portrays well how death sometimes leads people to understand themselves and to live.  Lovers of film noir will enjoy this film which is in the public domain and accessible online.

Edmund O'Brien plays an accountant who goes to the big city for one last fling before marrying his secretary. Things don't go according to plan when he is poisoned and finds out he has only a day or two to live. He chases around looking for the killer. It is almost continuous action of the type that was more common in the 50s and 60s. Not much blood and gore.

He finds one clue after another and finally finds the person responsible and kills him.

The story is told as a series of flashbacks as he relates it to the police as he is dying in a cop's office.

A few things annoyed me a little. Early on every time he saw an attractive female the soundtrack would add a wolf whistle. I also kept thinking this guy is no accountant, more like a P.I. as depicted in the 50s and 60s. There are also a few over the top camera shots here and there, especially of the crazy guy that is going to kill him driving along. The look on his would be killer's face is either classic or nuts, maybe both.

The lighting, locations, and atmosphere of brooding darkness were captured expertly by Mate

 ""Film noir"" refers to a genre to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.  It typically has certain stylistic (night shots, rain, shadow) and plot (good mix of shady characters. femme fatale, double and triple crosses, ordinary person makes a bad choice, & results in a fatalistic ending.

""DOA"" starts with a bang. An accountant (Edmond O'Brien) shows up at a police station and reports a murder - his own! In flashbacks we learn the details as he tries to track down how he was murdered, why, and by whom. Along the way we meet his secretary (Pam Britton), a crooked businessman (William Ching) and his secretary (Beverly Garland), and a gangster (Luther Adler) and his chief henchman (Neville Brand).

Location shooting was just coming into vogue in the early 50s. ""Side Street"" (1950) gave us an up close noir look at New York and this film does the same for San Francisco.

This film is mandatory viewing for fans of film noir, and a pretty good mystery thriller for the rest.

SPOILER ALERT

The film begins with what a BBC reviewer called ""perhaps one of cinema's most innovative opening sequences."" The scene is a long, behind-the-back tracking sequence featuring Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) walking through the hallway of a police station to report his own murder. Oddly, the police almost seem to have been expecting him and already know who he is.

 Marla Rakubian threatens Bigelow when he comes to her for information  A flashback begins with Bigelow in his hometown of Banning, California, where he is an accountant and notary public. He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.

Bigelow accompanies a group from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a ""jive"" nightclub called ""The Fisherman,"" unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat subculture. The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor's office, where tests reveal he swallowed a ""luminous toxin"" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange.

With a few days to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula. She provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Phillips had tried to contact him but died the previous day, purportedly a suicide. Bigelow travels to Phillips' import-export company in Los Angeles, first meeting Miss Foster (Beverly Garland) (whose on-screen credit reads ""Beverly Campbell""), the secretary, and then Mr. Halliday (William Ching), the company's comptroller, who tells him Eugene Phillips committed suicide. From there the trail leads to Phillips' widow (Lynn Baggett) and brother Stanley (Henry Hart).

The key to the mystery is a bill of sale for what turns out to be stolen iridium. Bigelow had notarized the document for Eugene Phillips six months earlier. He connects Phillips' mistress, Marla Rakubian (Laurette Luez), to gangsters led by Majak (Luther Adler). They capture Bigelow. Since Bigelow has learned too much, Majak orders his psychotic henchman Chester (Neville Brand) to kill him. However, Bigelow manages to escape.

Bigelow thinks Stanley and Miss Foster are his killers, but when he confronts them he finds Stanley has been poisoned tooafter having dinner with Mrs. Phillips. He directs them to call an ambulance and tells them what poison has been ingested so that, in Stanley's case at least, prompt treatment may save his life. Stanley tells Bigelow he found evidence that Halliday and Mrs. Phillips were having an affair. Bigelow realizes that the theft was merely a diversion. Eugene discovered the affair and Halliday killed him.

Halliday and Mrs. Phillips used the investigation of the iridium as a cover for their crime, making it seem that Eugene Phillips had killed himself out of shame. However, when they discovered that there was evidence of his innocence in the notarized bill of sale, Halliday murdered anyone who had knowledge of the bill of sale. Bigelow tracks Halliday down and shoots him to death in an exchange of gunfire.

The flashback comes to an end. Bigelow finishes telling his story at the police station and dies, his last word being ""Paula."" The police detective taking down the report instructs that his file be marked ""D.O.A.""",1432944000,,5517,5.0340285400658615

It could be argued that since O'Brien's Frank Bigelow is doomed from the start -regardless of the outcome of the ""zero hour""- the genre allows itself to spin-off into a noir element darker than anything that had come before (certainly at the time).

Talk about breathless! I had great trouble imagining a hung out to dry, tired middle-aged man become super human after ingesting poison, albeit 12 hours ago! This gent flys through airports, turnstiles and crowded streets like nobody's business. He is desperate for answers but refuses to tell anyone why, why? Most likely to frustrate and annoy the audience and admittedly with great success.

They sure do know how to dress and singly identify the bad guy with the hip houndstooth scarf and matching hat, what a stylish combination! And lest we forget the 'knife in the belly' lover evil henchman whose bug eyes were prominent scene stealers during the entire joy ride. This type of schtick was the underbelly of the script and truly laughable. The kazoo sound effect to appreciate the conference female clientele says it all.

Every time that syrupy sweet girlfriend attempts to flash her independence, there she is smothering him to no avail. The only person who seemed rationale was the police officer who made the final declaration of D.O.A. and for all that matters a designation for this script!

561245,3,6303038719,"Like ""The Lineup"", this is both an entertaining noir feature (although not quite as good) and a decent historical record of its period, in both Los Angeles and San Francisco.  I looked up ""luminous toxin""---the movies' central plot device---and Wikipedia has a great description of it among ""Fictitious Movie Toxins""  that brings the very absurdity of the 1950's Cold War hysteria to life, I quote, in part ""...easily slipped into liquor, especially during wild, alcohol crazed nights in San Francisco ""jive"" clubs.""  Ah yes,  Radiation!  Alcohol!  Mixed Race Debauchery!  Loud Music!  Like I've said, no one can accuse our fellow Americans of thinking too much.

O'Brien's character suddenly decides to go to San Francisco, from his desert home of Banning, for a vacation; by himself, without inviting his long suffering secretary/girl friend, or his apparent mistress of the moment.  His arrival at the St Francis hotel cooincides with the end of Market Week, where buyers and sellers are all in high revelry in the lobby and halls.  It's here where the movie has an inexplicable tendency to cat call---not a character, it's just the movie---a slide whistle sound every time a pretty girl walks by.  Kind of like some of Perez Prado's mambo's.  Fortunately, it abates by the time the story gets moving, which is when he wakes up the next morning feeling ill, and then goes to the doctor who tells him he's been poisoned...  and there's no antidote.

Let's just say that big chunks of the movie are not well acted.  O'Brien's blonde sweetheart practically turns herself into a tail wagging pug dog in front of him, and the camera, at one point.  Lots of the acting is melodramatic in the extreme, prompting The Partner to inquire at one moment ""Is this a novella?""

But...

There are great scenes across San Francisco and downtown Los Angeles, along Wilshire, and in Hollywood, with the characters either driving in great old cars, or riding vintage transit, or with the latter slipping past in the background.  I've seen much worse when it comes to acting (try watching some low budget gay films), and I would imagine that, should you find yourself in San Francisco, when this is playing at the Castro Theater, you could have a very entertaining evening watching it there, with the voluble audience participation the theater attracts for films like this,  that would make this movie a scream!",1406332800,,2394,4.935

Well, the Image Entertainment DVD is no better than it has to be: dirt, scratches, and jitter abound, not enough to ruin the experience of watching the movie, but enough to remind you that this is no Criterion Collection job.

There are no special features on the Image DVD. All you get is one of the finest existential crime thrillers in the B movie canon. Frank Bigelow is a heel with a conscience, a man whose actions in the course of his hunt for his own killer are pointless, yet defining, perhaps even ennobling.

I purchased the versions from ROAN and Image Entertainment (because those were the two versions that looked best from the five versions that DVD Beaver reviewed on his website). After comparing the two, I definitely prefer the ROAN version.
If you want to purchase a dvd of D.O.A. and are unsure between the ROAN and Image Entertainment versions, I suggest you get the ROAN, for I liked it better than the Image Entertainment version. My 4-star rating is for the ROAN dvd of D.O.A. (and NOT for the Image Entertainment one). If this was a regular movie, this ROAN dvd definitely would not have gotten 4 stars, cuz the quality is subpar compared to a normal movie. But the key point is that D.O.A. is not a normal movie: it is a public-domain movie, and there are so many awful dvd versions out there. SO, CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC-DOMAIN MOVIE AND THERE ARE SO MANY AWFUL DVD'S OUT THERE, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE ROAN DVD IS A PRETTY SOLID ONE.

p.s. on the ROAN dvd, there is a bonus feature with Beverly Garland telling a story about what happened after D.O.A. was nominated for an Academy Award. There is just one problem: D.O.A. was never nominated for an Academy Award!

561252,4,6303038719,"This fine film noir has one of the best known opening sequences in history.  Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) walks into a Los Angeles police station and says he wants to report a murder.  When asked who, he replies, ""Mine.""  The rest of the film is mostly shown in flashback as Frank tells his story.

About to be married to his secretary Paula (Pamela Britton), Frank, a CPA, figures he owes himself a week's R & R in San Francisco first.  Once there he hits a bar and heads out to see the sights.  Eventually he becomes ill and goes to the hospital to get checked out.  It turns out, he has been poisoned and has only a few days to live.  Mild mannered Frank now turns detective and tries to solve his own murder.

Retracing his steps he gets closer to the crime.  But none of this makes any sense to Frank or the viewer.  Why would anyone want to kill him?  We don't know until the final scenes and the reason will either delight or frustrate most viewers.  There is no mistaking the film for what it is however.  A well-acted crime thriller.

Here, O'Brien is a rather nondescript accountant who's slipped an irradiated drink at a tavern. The lethal poison has no antidote, but it's so slow-acting that O'Brien is given a chance to investigate who wants him dead, and maybe to exact revenge. A truly sad story, for the man's fate is sealed at the outset, yet we root for him every step of the way as he confronts psycho baddie Neville Brand (see product's cover) and follows false trails.

561348,5,6303038719,"Hey, over the couple of years that I have been periodically reviewing crime noirs I've seen it all. Bad gees getting away with murder, almost. Good gees getting the wrong end of the deal and just barely getting a little justice in this wicked old world before the scales turn, slightly. I've seen tough guy detectives take every beating imaginable before they, at the last second, grab the brass ring. I've seen more two-timing twisted sister femme fatale dames pile the corpses high and some skirt crazy guys grinning saying they were just misunderstood, almost. Ya, I've seen it all, brother. Well, not quite all, as the film under review, D.O.A., starring rugged looks 1950s actor Edmond O'Brian makes fatally clear. I`ve never done a review a where the dead guy is still walking. That is usually saved for a genre, horror films, that don't interest me, almost.

Let me back up (as is done in the film to explain that last point, otherwise this would be an exceedingly short review of an exceedingly short film). Average notary (for our purposes) Frank (played by the aforementioned Mr. O'Brian) needs a holiday bad. Bad from his closing in honey ready to make her kill (marriage and white picket fence cottages for two, okay). So naturally being a California desert guy and wanting to go wild he heads for be-bop 1950s San Francisco  (just as the beat geist begins its climb up those seven hills, or whatever number there are). But Frank picked a wrong day, a wrong weekend, wrong month, hell, and a wrong millennium to ""break out.""

Seems a regular work-a-day notary (accountant too) can know just a little too much. So in the language of the genre, he has to take ""the fall."" And he does, as a nefarious guy who has something to hide slips him the mickey. But what a mickey, a totally fatal, no cure, done, dead, if still walking dose done while, well, while he is preoccupied picking up one of those high-flying ""beat"" hanger-on women that were filling up the town just then. So that is why our boy Frank is a dead man walking. And the rest of the film, the fast-paced film, by the way, with great black and white shots (especially of a be-bop jazz group blowing that high white note to kingdom come in the fog-bound `Frisco night- shades of some Jack Kerouac dream song, or maybe Allen Ginsberg, a young Allen Ginsberg), is spent frantically unfolding how Frank got himself killed. And some remorse over not treating his honey back in the desert so good.

A great film but I still have this lingering question. Since he knew (including getting a second medical opinion on the question) he was doomed in a day or two, a week at the most, why was not reveling in wine, women and song, especially that high-flying frail from the bistro, instead of almost getting himself ""killed"" (early) trying to find the truth?

561413,5,6303038719,"""DOA"" is one of the best film noir movies from the classic period.  ""Film noir"" refers to a genre with certain stylistic (night shots, rain, shadow) and plot (good mix of shady characters. femme fatale, double and triple crosses, ordinary person makes a bad choice, fatalistic ending) conventions. Film noir had its roots in German expressionism and films like ""The Blue Angel"" (1929) and ""M"" (1931) as well as American gangster films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1931) and ""Scarface"" (1932). Following WW 2, American films reached France where the audiences had a chance to watch several films together. When they saw ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) and ""Window in the Window"" (1944), they coined the term ""film noir"" to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.

""DOA"" starts with a bang. An accountant (Edmond O'Brien) shows up at a police station and reports a murder - his own! In flashbacks we learn the details as he tries to track down how he was murdered, why, and by whom. Along the way we meet his secretary (Pam Britton), a crooked businessman (William Ching) and his secretary (Beverly Garland), and a gangster (Luther Adler) and his chief henchman (Neville Brand).

Edmond O'Brien (1915-85) does an excellent job, even better than his bravura performance as the passionate insurance investigator who solves the mystery of Burt Lancaster's murder in film noir classic ""The Killers"" (1946). He also did excellent work in character roles, especially the grissled Freddy Sykes in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), Oscar Muldoon in ""The Barefoot Contessa"" (1954), the fiery Senator in ""Seven Days in May (1962), and the newspaper publisher in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962). He won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for ""Barefoot Contessa"" and was nominated for ""Seven Days in May"".

Group Theatre co-founder Luther Adler (1903-84) moved gracefully between stage, TV and film. He appeared in the remake of ""M"" (1951), played Hitler in ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), and Paul Newman's uncle in ""Absence of Malice"" (1981). He was nominated for a Golden Laurel for ""The Last Angry Man"" (1959).

The film marks the screen debuts of Neville Brand (1920-92) and Beverly Garland. Pock faced, tough Neville Brand was a war hero turned movie actor who gave us excellent performances in more than 100 films and TV appearances, often as the heavy. He played Al Capone several times (""The George Raft Story"", ""The Scarface Mob"", ""Alcatraz Express"", and on TV's ""The Untouchables""), but his very best performance, and one of the all time greatest performances, was as ""Joe Brothers"" in a ""Naked City"" (1962) episode entitled ""Lament for a Dead Indian"".

Sexy Beverly Garland (1926-2008) is best known as Fred McMurray's wife from ""My 3 Sons"" (1969-72) and Kate Jackson's mother from ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" (1983-7), but she got a lot of work in the early 50s in Roger Corman films. She was one of the first actors to move seamlessly from TV to films and the very first actress to portray a woman detective on TV.

Director Rudolph Mate (1898-1964) was originally a cinematographer and was Oscar nominated 5 years in a row, from 1940 (""Foreign Correspondent"") to 1944 (""Cover Girl""). He turned to directing in 1947 and made films like ""Union Station"" (1950), ""When Worlds Collide"" (1951), and ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962). ""DOA"" is considered his best directorial effort.

Ernest Laszlo (1898-1984) provides great photography, although with Mate as a director, it's hard to know who is responsible. Laszlo was nominated for an Oscar 8 times and won for ""Ship of Fools"" (1965). His notable films include ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960), ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961), and ""Logan's Run"" (1976)

Location shooting was just coming into vogue in the early 50s. ""Side Street"" (1950) gave us an up close noir look at New York and this film does the same for San Francisco.

The NY Times called the film a ""fairly obvious and plodding recital"" though they did praise O'Brien and Britton. The film was remade in 1969 and again in 1988.

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born Yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were - ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"".

There are a plethora of film noir movies from the late 40s and early 50s. Along with this film, my personal favorites are ""The Killers"" (1946) with Burt Lancaster in his film debut, ""Sorry Wrong Number"" (1948) with Barbara Stanwyck, Nic Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950) with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame, ""Angel Face"" (1953) with Jean Simmons and Robert Mitchum.

561414,5,6303038719,"The version of D.O.A. I purchased came bundled with 10 other films of the genre but if the picture quality and themes are any indication, the remainder of the package should be spectacular.

D.O.A was made in 1949, released in 1950, and one of its charms is its portrayal of ordinary San Francisco city life.  There are bus scenes, hotel scenes, as well as an incredible fugue through San Francisco streets by O'Brien himself as accountant Frank Bigelow, after he discovers he's been poisoned incurably.  Finally, the movie contains the best rendition on film I've ever seen of a late '40's hard bop jazz scene played out by what had to be authentic jazz musicians.  The camera work on the band is up front and personal in a Hitchcock style, and while you are mesmerized by their sound and handiwork, the killer makes his appearance.

O'Brien and Pamela Britton as Paula, Bigelow's paramour have a rendevous in Los Angeles that for my money is as close and convincing as anything Bogart and Ingrid Bergeman achieve in Casablanca.  That's high praise but its warranted.

The only shortcoming in D.O.A. (and what sets it apart from Casablanca) is the ending which is entirely contrived.  In the final scene, our lead detective is heard to utter the phrase ""Let me break it to her gently."" No modern movie maker would ignore a line like that.  We all want to see how Pamela Britton would have handled the news, but in 1949, regretably, she wasn't given the chance.

IN DOA Frank Bigelow, played by Edmund O'Brien, wakes up after a night on the town feeling not so well. He goes to a doctor and is told he has been poisoned and only has  a short time to live. After he absorbs the shocking news he decides to spend that time finding out how and why and mostly, who did this to him. In other words, he is a dead man trying to find his own killer.

As time progresses we follow the frantic Frank Bigelow from his vacation spot at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel down to Los Angeles and chasing virtually everywhere he thinks might yeild a part of the puzzle.
DOA is literally a chase movie, but at times it seems that Frank Bigelow is chasing himself.
Chasing hmself trying to find out who murdered him and why.

As the day wears on, it's really not clear how much time Bigelow has left, and when  the day changes into night and the cinematography gets darker and more noirish just as this whole scenario seems to get even more tightly wound and confusing, until finally a solution to the mystery is found and when the story's climax is reached it all comes as something of a shock after the emotional involvement the audience has invested in DOA.

I think that DOA is a excellent example of the noir mystery, well filmed and acted. The story kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its 83 minute length and the acting is very believable with not a clinker in the bunch.

It was said that Edmond O'Brien (Frank Bigelow) ducks into the `Garden of Allah' to hide from his pursuers. As I have an interest in early Hollywood buildings and had only seen photos of the `Garden' I fast forwarded to that particular scene. Can you imagine my disappointment when I realised that the building Frank Bigelow ducked into wasn't the `Garden of Allah'
It was about a week later that I watched the whole movie from start to finish and although the quality of the (Enhanced?) DVD was poor, the plot turned out to be pretty good and in the `film noir' tradition.

561473,5,6303038719,"This riveting entry in the noir cycle is everything many others made in the genre during this time period failed to be. Despite a relatively meager budget, Rudolph Mate used the lovely San Francisco locations and a harrowing set of circumstances to create a minor masterpiece. Atmospheric and suspenseful, the viewer races against time with the hero as Mate ratchets the tension to a fever pitch. How we often realize the importance of loving someone too late makes for a moving ending, as the police report is stamped, D.O.A.

The story line is that a man in San Francisco reports his own murder. Mate creates drama from the opening moments as the still very much alive victim walks down a long corridor to the Homicide Division. Edmond O'Brien gives a solid performance as the man in question, Frank Bigelow. He's planning a weekend jaunt to San Francisco to avoid committing to his girlfriend. Pamela Britton is quite nice in the role of Frank's devoted sweetheart, Paula Gibson. Paula's phone calls and small reminders act as his conscience every time he sees a pretty girl and bells go off. Despite this, however, he ends up with a group across the hall from his swanky St. Francis Hotel room. Nothing ends up happening but when he wakes up, something doesn't feel right.

A trip to the doctor reveals that he has been poisoned in a way which cannot be treated or reversed. Stunned and initially in denial, Frank finally becomes angry when he's told it could not have been an accident. Mate adds an ironic touch when an exhausted Frank, coming to terms with what's happened, leans against a newsstand featuring LIFE magazine. Throughout the story, the director takes full advantage of the cable cars and nightlife of this fabulous city, which has become a dark nightmare for a man bent on finding the man who has killed him. There are some fabulous twists and turns in the screenplay of Russell Rouse and Clarence Green along the way, as every second which ticks by is one less Bigelow has to solve the mystery of his own death.

There is both urgency and danger as Frank gets closer to the truth, and some tenderness when a worried Paula shows up to help. He has realized too late she was always the one, and now only just has time to tell her before he finishes his last task. A great cast includes William Ching, Beverly Garland, Luther Adler and Lynn Baggett. Of special note are Laurette Luez as the tawdry Marla Rakubian and a young Neville Brand as the psychopath, Chester. TV fans may remember Brand as Texas Ranger Reese Bennett in Laredo. He was a war hero who earned many medals, including a Purple Heart and Silver Star. Here he is quite good at being the bad guy.

A poignant ending punctuates this truly masterful noir. It is a film both technically brilliant, and with a heart. O'Brien is excellent and Britton adds a tenderness to the film with her quiet and realistic performance. A fabulous and unique film that is a must for film buffs.",1271116800,3,2960,4.653919694072658

Edmond O'Brien runs up and down the streets of San Francisco and L.A. looking for the person who murdered him (by slipping him a ""micky"" laced with luminous poisoning) at a San Francisco night spot.

As with all such bargain brands, dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair. Audio levels are however some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

D.O.A. long ago was allowed to slip into the public domain. It stars character actor Edmund O'Brien (check him out as Dutton Peabody in John Ford's 1962 classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MAN-WHO-SHOT-LIBERTY-VALANCE/dp/B00005ASGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE</a>&nbsp;or as Vic Pardo in Jimmy Cagney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHITE-HEAT/dp/B0006HBV3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHITE HEAT</a>, from '49).

Here, O'Brien is a rather nondescript accountant who's slipped an irradiated drink at a tavern. The lethal poison has no antidote, but it's so slow-acting that O'Brien is given a chance to investigate who wants him dead, and maybe to exact revenge. A truly sad story, for the man's fate is sealed at the outset, yet we root for him every step of the way as he confronts psycho baddie Neville Brand (see product's cover) and follows false trails. This is truly one of the best of the film noir genre, and is highly recommended!

561479,5,6303038719,The D.O.A. release by Roan and Image of this great film noir are pretty much the same.  I would have to recommend the Roan release because of the intro with Beverly Garland.  The Image disc has no extras.,1246147200,2,204,4.342105263157895
561480,4,6303038719,"I'd love to give this wonderful film full marks(as it deserves),but this DVD release comes up a bit short on the technical and the extras side,as you will see.
D.O.A.,directed by Rudolp Mate'(his directorial debut)is my favourite film noir of all I have seen and the passage of time has not diminished its' punch at all.
It concerns the story of a notary public/accountant by the name of Frank Bigelow(Edmund O'Brien).The film opens with the camera following him into a Los Angeles police station. Like the last mile,he is walking through(and has walked)very long and windy corridors to reach the exact room and this moment. When he enters he explains in a very low key but deliberate manner that he wants to report a murder. When asked whose murder,he replies that it is HIS!!He proceeds to relate his story which now turns into the rest of the film. Just a few days previously he had flown to San Francisco for a weekend away,leaving behind his secretary and fiancee Paula(Pamela Britton).He has mixed feelings about their relationship and after checking into the St Francis Hotel(the very same hotel Roscoe Arbuckle was falsely accused of raping Virginia Rappe'in,that turned into the trial of the century!),he is already eyeing the pretty girls that are awash around him. Accompanied to his room by the bellhop(Jerry Paris,better known in later years as Dick Van Dyke's dentist neighbour Jerry on the show of the same name),he gets settled in and before he knows it is invited to a party across the hall. So involved does he become that he is soon invited out with the group to a local jazz bar,The Fisherman(watch for a quick shot of actor Hugh O'Brian-no relation to the star- sitting at a table).There the music is hot and so is one man's wife whose attention to Bigelow has the attendant husband a little on the jealous side. To get away from her Bigelow sidles up to the bar and orders a drink. Spying another lovely lady he goes and sits next to her. Realizing he has left his drink he asks the bartender to fetch it over to him. A man with his back to the camera in an overcoat,spotted scarf and with a hat who was on a seat behind Bigelow when he first came up to the bar,switches his drink. When the bartender grabs the drink the unknown man gets up and leaves. Bigelow takes a swig of the drink and realizes right off something is not right. Another swig and he asks for another one. He returns to his suite and next morning is feeling off. He goes to a doctor who confirms to a totally shocked Bigelow that he has ingested some kind of toxic luminous poison and he has only a couple of days to a week on the outside to live. In disbelief he seeks out another opinion at a local hospital only to have the same diagnosis confirmed. When Bigelow says that he has no idea as to how he came to ingest the liquid the doctor says the police must be called as this is now a murder! He runs from the hospital and at one point he stops and leans up against a newsstand(watch for the ""Life"" magazines placed deliberately beside him!)to catch his breath and weigh his options. He comes to the realization that he must and WILL find out what happened to him,why and just who is responsible. From here the movie takes him from one lead to another,some false some positive. Here is a man that was leading a rather mundane life and in fact was unsure about anything really,including himself. Now we see that though he is dying he is more alive with self realization and purpose than he has ever been before. As he tracks down his killer he goes full tilt as he is in essence a dead man walking with nothing to lose. I won't give away the ending to this film but Bigelow finds himself being shot at,kidnapped and almost murdered for the answers he is seeking and through much tribulation,finally succeeds in finding out the answers to the entire bizarre situation.
A secretary at an import/export business he attends run by one Halliday(William Ching),is none other than Beverly Garland(here Beverly Campbell);the on-TV future husband of Fred McMurray in My Three Sons. And Chester,a thug on the payroll of a local gangster/businessman Majak (Luther Adler),is played with a beautiful sadistic/psychotic twist by Neville Brand.
From the first unique opening and set up of this movie,this film has you in its' grip. You're with Bigelow from the beginning to the very end, empathizing with him,urging him on and are watching him asking the same questions and behaving in the same manner you might if you were in his shoes. They certainly could not have cast anyone better than Edmund O'Brien to play the lead. It is filled with gritty,sometimes erotic,some heart wrenching and some violent moments all wrapped in a mood of constant desperation as Bigelow tries to find answers;answers he MUST and will have. Just a wonderful film from beginning to end.
On the technical side of things the outside packaging tells us this print was made from a negative in the possession of the producer,Leo Popkin. I would like to know if this was a camera negative negative or a negative from(what generation) a print. I suspect the latter as this film, while good in contrast and generally fairly crisp,does have its' less than stellar moments. It can be a little on the scratchy/dirty side at times quite grainy. Also there is a very short scene where Bigelow confronts Beverly Garland just outside her office later in the picture;  the film is suddenly washed out and the sound is not good. In the next scene in the office the picture is back to normal. It seems the producers' negative was missing this scene so it was inserted from a rather poor source. Besides this is the issue of the extras:simply said,there are NONE.This a bare bones release and I don't think they should be asking the price they are for it.
In concluding then,because of the technical deficiencies,I unfortunately have to deduct one star. However this is the best print available at this time and it is well worth getting,if the cost doesn't bother you. The film unfortunately fell into the public domain sometime I believe in the late 70s. It was made for a very small independent company originally but picked up and distributed by United Artists. It is quite possible MGM,who now own the UA catalogue,may come out one day with a very fine print for us to savour;we'll cross our fingers.
In the meantime there are very few film noirs that can come up to the level this film gets to in my opinion. It's a sharp,smart and gritty film that grabs you from its' first few minutes and never lets go. If you like the film noir genre or just dig a great suspense filled thriller/action picture then there can be no other film to get than D.O.A.!",1235174400,2,6696,4.631623212783852
561481,4,6303038719,"When I started watching all the film noirs I could find, I was a bit disappointed in this. However, after three viewings I now find it decent. It's nothing super, but certainly better than what I though at first. A big help is having a better print of the film. This is one of those movies that always had a poor VHS quality transfer and many times the same on DVD.

Finding a good print is hard, although I finally got a decent one with the ""Killer Classic DVD set"" that includes this movie.

The story is not always easy to follow even though the premise is very simple. A man discovers he has been poisoned and there is no hope for recovery. Before he dies, he retraces his steps to find out who ""murdered him"" (even though he's still alive when saying that) and why.

The story gets a bit complicated. Like a Sherlock Holmes or Charlie Chan mystery, there are a number of suspects that keep popping up. Many of them are hard to figure.

This is an odd film noir for several quirky things in this movie. The lead character, ""Frank Bigelow"" (Edmund O'Brien), is strange and kind of stupid in the beginning. There are a half dozen of these dumb whistle-like wolf call sound-effects that come out every time he sees a pretty woman. It just doesn't fit in a tough film noir. Then there is his possessive girlfriend/secretary ""Paula,"" (Pamela Britton) who is constantly calling him and paranoid about his whereabouts. She acts more like an insecure, nagging wife but she obviously cares a great deal about him. But, man, give the poor guy some space!

The dialog in this film ranges from incredibly stupid to very clever and solid film noir material.

We also see one of the most sadistic people I have ever seen on film: ""Chester,"" played by the nasty-looking Neville Brand. Wow, is this guy sick or what? He reminded me of ""Vera"" (Ann Savage) in ""Detour."" Those two would have made an interesting couple! Brand's character is only interested in one thing in life: inflicting pain and the slower and more brutal, the better.

Anyway, if you find a good print, tolerate some of the goofy things in the film, this is an interesting film noir that gets better with each viewing, as you understand the story better.",1233964800,4,2210,4.5376884422110555

He has no idea who did it and spends almost the entire film tracking down the dirty rat that done him in. It's amazing how many wonderful noir films O'Brien appeared in over the years.

The pacing is good, acting top-rate and very noir-ish, and it manages to pull so much out of a very simple plot with minimal sets.

561524,5,6303038719,"Some films, like people, ""wear"" better than others. For me, ""Shawshank Redemption "" is a film I like better each time I've viewed after its original release; conversely, ""Forrest Gump"" is one I've never enjoyed as much subsequently as I did initially.

""DOA"" is one which I've grown to like more each time I've seen it over the years.

Edmund O'Brien was an actor who was often the 2nd or 3rd male lead, portraying characters who were a friend, confidante or adversary of the primary star(s). And where he was the lead, as in ""DOA,"" it was usually a lower-budget work. However, his performances were always well-done, and provided convincing portrayals of the characters assigned.

""DOA"" provides the nostalgic, ""noir"" feeling of this type of drama, as filmed 5 or 6 decades ago. Viewed now, in addition to an interesting story and plot, it provides an often amusing glimpse of the way stories were approached, and techniques utilized -- then, versus the way they'd be done today. (The supposed remake of this film - with Dennis Quade - is far below the level of this film, despite have today's technical advantages. It bears a resemblance to this original solely in that the lead male ingests the fatal substance early-on, and the plot deals with the dilemma and how he addresses it.)

In this film, O'Brien is the sole proprietor of a small bookkeeping service, with only a ""gal Friday"" in his employ, in the southern California town of Banning, who has misfortune upon visiting San Francisco.

And it is not his primary function of keeping books and doing taxes which generates his problem -- it is his collateral function as (of all things!) a notary public which brings his serious problem upon him (and can anything be more ""serious"" than having been slipped a fatal ""mickey"" for which there is no antidote??).

Edmund scurries around San Francisco to seek the perpetrator of his impending demise, moving about like a Sikh running barefoot over a bed of hot coals. There are several over-the-top, slightly cornball aspects to his character's actions, as well as with regard to other characters and his interaction with them. Neville Brand plays the psychotic, hotheaded goon to perfection (also with humor as well as malice) the kind of role for which this character actor was perfect.

The scene where his hotel room is adjacent to convention revelers, with the married lady trying to seduce him, is hilarious, These folks looked like, say, a group of small-town convenience store owners, loose for the first time in the big city.

I've been to the ""Bay Area"" on extended visits a few times, and while the traffic and overall bustle might have been a bit less in this film than I encountered in later years -- from my experience in this crowded, busy city, it would have taken Edmund's character about two weeks to have done all the hurrying and scurrying, and visiting all his many destinations, whereas he accomplished all of this in a matter of hours in this story.

Still, a very entertaining movie, with these features adding to the enjoyment of its story.",1228867200,3,3068,4.817490494296578

The movie then goes into flashback mode and we witness the events that brought about his predicament and his tracing of the killer. It is a clever story and kudos should be bestowed upon the writers Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse for the ingenious plot .
Bigelow is murdered while in LA attending a convention and the modus operandi is the covert administration of a poison for which there is no known antidote .On being advised that he only has a short time to live he devotes his time to identifying the killer .The journey takes him into the seedier side of LA and Frisco bringing him into contact with the dark side of American society. Dark in this case can be taken literally as events unfold mostly at night or in darkened rooms

The photography by Ernest Laszlo is moodily effective and the score is quite exceptional but then it is by Dimitri Tiomkin ,so what do you expect?
O'Brien is rarely absent from the scren and he does a superb job of holding things together displaying what an under-rated actoer he was .Pamela Britton as his secreatry and confidants is fine and the debuting Neville Brand (playing a psychotic killer and hired muscle)is compelling .Watch out too for another debutant in Beverly Campbell(later Garland) and Luther Adler in another of his splendid slimeball turns .Rudolph Mate's direction is exemplary

  This is a dark, complex tale that manages to make you suspect every-
one and know that there is a new twist around every corner. Each charactor
we meet has a story to tell that is not quite true.
  Exquisite lighting, sound track and framing set the mood for the most
part except for the bizarre wolf whistles that accompany the appearance of
every beautiful woman he sees in San Francisco while he is out to have a
wild time away from his girlfriend, Paula. This part of the soundtrack is an off the mark distraction opposed to an otherwise nearly perfect acoust-
ic mirror for the action.
  The taught fast moving story line provides enough twists and turns to lose the viewer who does not pay close attention.
  Like most films of the genre, it relies heavily on dialogue to keep
up the pace. D.O.A. adds plenty of action to move this nifty litle film a-
long at a speed that make it's eighty-three minutes simply fly by.
  Lively performances by Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton and a brief but intense and spellbinding performance by Neville Brand push this Noir
thriller into the must own, Noir Classique realm.
  It has a dark finis' that entertains us even though fate deals our
anti-hero one bum hand after another. At last he sees love has been near
at hand but time has run out.
  This is a ""must have"" for all real Noir fans.",1184889600,3,1935,4.402816901408451
561532,4,6303038719,"Perhaps it's my own fault for going into this movie with high expectations (great reviews on both NetFlix and Amazon tend to do that), and for approaching it after having seen the 3rd Man and the Maltese Falcon (what man couldn't expect the very best from the genre after these two classics?), but I found this movie just a little underwhelming.

Everything with this movie is in the right place, with the exception of those wolf whistles at the start, but somehow it all lacks the emotional punch that the other two classics effectively carry. The main character just isn't as slick or hard-boiled as Bogart, the villain isn't as charming a person as Wells, and the action sequences appear far too improbable to be taken seriously. No one but Bigelow seems to be able to handle a gun, and he's just a flirtatious accountant.

All these keep me from claiming this a classic noir on par with the two mentioned, as they detract from the emotional involvement the viewer invests in the movie. In the 3rd Man, during the chase scene around the rubble, or during the sewer shoot-out, you really did feel as if a wrong move on the protagonist's part could cause an early death, and this caused the heart to race. Here, after seeing how every single villain can't shoot straight across the room, there's just no such pressure.

All this is to warn you of exorbitant expectations. This movie is quite solid, as the plot twists are ingenious, and knowing that the character is poisoned right from the very start keeps you constantly guessing in the first third as to who the perpetrator was (and the director gives you a lot of suspects). Once this mystery is gone, another piles up, and when everything is finally resolved, you are left astounded by the sheer arbitrariness (and yet complete plausibility) of everything that has happened.",1168560000,2,1830,4.730407523510972
561606,5,6303038719,"D.O.A. (1950) is one of those films I try to watch about once a year (a lot easier since purchasing it on DVD) as it's a classic American film-noir mystery/drama with quite a bit going for it, along with a few, minor flaws (the minor flaws tend to stand out a little more here because most of the other aspects are so strong).  Directed by Rudolph Mat (When Worlds Collide, The Violent Men), an accomplished cinematographer prior to moving into the realm of directing, the feature stars Oscar winning character actor Edmond O'Brien (The Hitch-Hiker, The Barefoot Contessa, The Wild Bunch).  Also appearing is Pamela Britton (""Blondie"", ""My Favorite Martian""), Lynn Baggett (The Time of Their Lives), Luther Adler (Voyage of the Damned), Beverly Garland (The Alligator People), William Ching (In a Lonely Place), Laurette Luez (Prehistoric Women), and Neville Brand (Halls of Montezuma, Stalag 17), in his first credited feature film role.  For fans of the television show ""Green Acres"", keep an eye peeled for Frank `Sam Drucker' Cady, as he's got a bit part early on as a bartender.

As the film opens we see a man entering a large, metropolitan police station and head towards the homicide division.  Upon arriving, we learn he's there to report a murder...his own!  Turns out the man's name is Frank Bigelow (O'Brien), and he's a accountant from a small, Californian town, to which we move into a lengthy flashback as he relates his tale.  Frank works in a small, podunk town along with secretary/girlfriend Paula (Britton), and it seems Paula's a little put out by the fact Frank has announced, on very short notice, that he's taking a trip to San Francisco to get a little time for himself.  As Frank arrives at his hotel, the joint's jumping with conventioneers, a group of them Frank ends up hooking up with...after a night out on the town Frank returns to the hotel and wakes the next morning feeling rather poorly, enough so to cause him to see a doctor, which he's then informed he's been poisoned!  Not only that, but the poison is fatal, and he's got perhaps a week, at the most, to live.  Some vacation...anyway, Frank eventually discovers his predicament was deliberately caused, and sets out to discover the whos and the whys.  The trail leads Frank to a minor business dealing he had some time ago with a character named Renoylds, one involving the sale of some precious metals.  As Frank delves deeper into the mystery he stirs up a hornet's nest of trouble, mainly for himself, as there are those who don't appreciate his sudden interest their affairs, and runs afoul of some thugs, the result being if the poison coursing through his system doesn't kill him, the various bullets thrown his way might...

I think one of the more interesting aspects of this film for me was how O' Brien's character just wasn't an entirely likeable fellow in the beginning, one that I found myself rooting for by the end (albeit halfheartedly).  You see, in scenes near the beginning, Frank is portrayed as a sort of philanderer, especially once he hits San Francisco.  That, in and of itself wouldn't mean much to me, except for the fact he's stringing along a swell dame in Paula (Ms. Britton looked incredibly beautiful here, but not inaccessible) who's completely devoted to him, so much so she's willing to put up with his peccadilloes.  Sure she gets miffed, but she always ends up coming around, and, at one point, she basically tells Frank there isn't anything he can do that would cause her feelings for him to falter...probably not something you should relate to someone with a wandering eye.  Once Frank accepts his predicament (that whole dying thing), he does eventually come around, realizing what's important, so there is a strong, moral element involved.  Another element I enjoyed was the character of Chester the thug, played by Neville Brand, who appears later in the story.  It's always fun when they throw a sadistic, wild-eyed psychotic in the mix, especially one who tends to refer to himself in the third person and call his handgun `Baby'.  There's a couple really great lines of dialogue present, one of which I used for the title of this review.  It occurs once Frank begins unraveling the mystery of his murder, and he gets terse with femme fatale whom he believes to be involved (she is), to which she tells him ""If you were a man I'd punch your dirty face in."".  Another good one comes just prior to this, as he's strong arming a tight-lipped secretary, played by Beverly Garland, into spilling her guts telling her she's ""in this right up to your pretty, little neck!"".  I thought the performances, the direction, the writing, and cinematography all very strong, complimented wonderfully by Dimitri Tiomkin's vibrant musical score.  The pacing is quick and leads up to an exciting and engaging climax, one definitely worth sticking around for...there is one aspect I did find annoying, and it wasn't the fact so many fabulous babes seemed willing to throw themselves at a slightly paunchy Edmond O'Brien.  It involved the usage of a slide whistle.  As O'Brien's character arrives at his hotel in San Francisco early on, every time he sees a babe there's a simulated wolf call sound effect created with a slide whistle.  Now this is something I'd expect in a screwball comedy starring Jerry Lewis, but not something that fits in with the material here, especially given the rather dramatic opening sequence.  I'm unsure who decided to throw that particular sound effect in, but they didn't do the picture any favors.  It certainly doesn't ruin the film, but I thought I should warn those interesting in see it, as it may draw you out of the feature as it did me, eliciting a ""What the fudge?"" response.  Despite that minor point, the rest is gold, especially if you're a fan of noir.

It looks as if this film has been release onto DVD various times, by a few, different companies, but the version I own was released by Image Entertainment, as part of The Wade Williams Collection.  The DVD case states the source material used was a restored producer's negative.  The picture, presented in full screen (1.33:1) does look clean and sharp, but there are minor imperfection throughout (no frames seem to be missing, though).  As far as the Dolby Digital mono audio, it seemed to me the levels weren't entirely consistent, as I found myself regularly adjusting the volume (maybe my ears are going bad, I don't know).  There aren't any extras included, but there are chapter stops.  I haven't seen the other DVD releases so I can't compare this to them, but I'm familiar enough with Image Entertainment's DVD releases to feel comfortable in saying the overall quality here is probably better than on some of the less expensive releases.  I did notice a Roan release available, and I've found their releases to be solid, so if your looking for a less expensive version but still better than average quality, that might be a way to go.

561610,4,6303038719,"This review is for the 2003 Alpha Video DVD.

This basic synopsis of D.O.A. is that an accountant, Frank Bigelow (Edmund O'Brien), decides to leave town for a week and go to San Francisco for a vacation.  He leaves behind his clinging girlfriend/secretary (Pamela Britton) and gets involved with a wild group of men and women at his hotel and they later go out on the town.  For a reason that is not initially obvious, someone poisons Bigelow's drink with a fatal toxin, and he finds out that he only has a short time to live.  So he uses that precious time to figure who murdered him.

This noir film is fast paced with a lot happening over a very short period of time.  Some of the scenes aren't pulled off convincingly, but it is still entertaining.  This film was made in 1950 and was later remade in 1988 starring Dennis Quaid.  If you enjoy late '40's and early '50's noir crime dramas, you will not be disappointed with this film.  It's a good movie, but by no means a great one.

As for the DVD, my issue was released by Alpha Video, who has a notorious reputation for poor picture quality DVDs.  Of the 20 or so different DVDs that I've viewed from Alpha, this is the best I've seen, but it still has some minor problems.  Tiny spots of wear can be seen intermittently throughout the film, and there are two short sequences where noticeable film scratches can be seen for about 4-5 seconds in each segment.  Also, the DVD transfer is not as sharp compared to one from a major studio and the last 10 minutes of the film does not look as focused as the prior 73 minutes.  But overall, it is still very worthy of viewing and the sound is satisfactory.

561615,5,6303038719,"A man named Frank Bigelow (Edmund O'Brian) shows up at Los Angeles police station to report a murder: his own. Frank is dying of luminous toxin poisoning. He recounts to police the incredible story that brought him to be at the brink of death in this police station in a strange city. Just a few days ago, he was a small business owner in a little town called Banning. He had an adoring girlfriend, Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), who was also his personal secretary. But Frank had cold feet about marrying Paula and decided to take a little vacation to San Francisco to give himself some air. Paula called to tell him that a man named Phillips was desperately trying to reach him, but the name didn't ring a bell. The next day, Frank found out that he had been fatally and irreversibly poisoned. Frank's increasingly frantic search for the identity and motivation of his murderer takes him to two cities, into the criminal underworld, and onto the wrong end of several pistols before all is done.

Rudolph Mate's ""D.O.A."" is a film noir classic. And it takes the cynical view typical of the genre. Frank is a man whose fate is entirely beyond his control. As the audience roots for Frank to solve the mystery and find his murderer, fate unabashedly mocks his efforts. Frank is a dying man; what earthly difference will it make if he finds his killer? Whatever Frank does, the result will be the same. And it's all because he notarized a bill of sale...one out of hundreds of bills of sales. Who knew what being a notary could lead to? But for a movie with such a cynical story to tell, ""D.O.A."" has always been immensely popular. I think that's because Frank Bigelow is an ""everyman"" who rises to the occasion when difficult circumstances require it. He's not too smart and not too dumb. He has a nice girlfriend...to whom he isn't entirely faithful. He's basically a good guy, works hard, but imperfect. And when fate deals him a bad deal, he finds within him a strength and determination that even he may not have known he had. He's going to solve the mystery if it's the last thing he does. Even though it will be the last thing he does. Edmund O'Brian does an admirable job of conveying Frank's imperfection, his initial incredulity at his predicament, and then his determination when he stares reality in the face and decides to take matters into his own hands, to the extent that he can. The opening scene in which Frank enters the police station to report his own murder is a stroke of genius. What a way to hook an audience! The only fault that I find with the film are the ridiculous noises that we hear every time Frank spies an attractive woman. Their tone is completely inappropriate to the film, and they are a real blot on Dimitri Tiomkin's otherwise excellent score.

The DVD (This refers to the Roan Group DVD only): This film looks too contrasty and lacking in subtle tonality to me. Not having seen the film on the silver screen, I don't know if it was originally like that, if there was a problem with the print, or if it's a bad transfer. But the film stocks available in 1950 were technologically much better than this DVD would lead you to believe. The main menu on the disc doesn't show up before the movie. The disc starts to play as soon as it is inserted into the player, so you have to either hit the menu button on your remote or get yourself onto your couch quickly. There are two bonus features: An interview with actress Beverly Campbell (now Beverly Garland) in which she describes her experience being blacklisted by the Hollywood studios for several years following her appearance in ""D.O.A."" And there are a few pages of text that you can read about film noir in general and ""D.O.A."" in particular.

The film begins in a city at night. A man walks into the police station or report a murder. ""Who is dead?"" they ask. ""I am."" Frank Bigelow tells his story. He lives in Banning, a small town near the desert where he is an accountant. He will travel to San Francisco on a vacation. Paula Gibson is upset by this news. Will they get married? Frank arrives in San Francisco, the St. Francis Hotel is crowded with buyers (post-war prosperity). He gets a call from the office, a Mr. Phillips wants to talk to him. Salesmen are meeting buyers in a holiday atmosphere party. They visit bars to hear jazz. The musicians play as in a frenzy. [Did someone switch glasses?] Are the jive fans being mocked? The next morning Frank doesn't feel well. He walks the streets to the Medical Center for tests.

A nurse stares at this patient. The doctors tell of luminous toxin in his system, there is no antidote or cure! And only a few days to live! Frank is in denial. There is another diagnostic. This is not an accident! The city streets have little traffic. You can see the reflection of the green-and-white buses in the store windows. Paula calls to tell him that Mr. Phillips just died last night in Los Angeles. A DC-3 flies through the air. Frank goes to see Mr. Phillips office. Comptroller Halliday speaks to him. Phillips died in a fall from his apartment. His widow knows nothing. Phillips had been arrested for dealing in stolen iridium. Frank notarized a bill of sale from Mr. George Reynolds years ago. Frank searches for clues about Reynolds. Someone shoots at him, Frank grabs his revolver and shoots back. Back at his hotel strange men kidnap him. Paula calls again. These men take him to see Mr. Majack, they speak. Chester is psychopathic. [Is that name Armenian?] Majack explains his options.

Chester takes Frank for a ride in a car. But Frank puts the brakes to that. Chester waves a pistol in a drugstore, a policemen puts a stop to that. Paula goes to meet him. Is he feverish? The Homicide detective had called. Frank goes to see Stanley, and learns more about the plot and the guilty parties. He goes to see Mrs. Phillips and learns about the deal for iridium. Majack shows up with his boys. Frank flees on a bus to escape them. Frank goes to see Halliday, but they say little. The story returns to the police station, and then stops speaking. The Missing Person Report is stamped ""Dead On Arrival"". The film explains there is a poison called ""luminous toxin"" but don't name it so people won't be tempted to use it.

This is a near perfect story with little padding (except for the jazz club scenes). Iridium is a rare metal that may be used by the military. A phosphorous compound could glow in the dark (""The Hound of the Baskervilles""). [A radium compound was used for luminescent watch dials. It poisoned hundreds of the factory workers who used it.] The film shows San Francisco at night when few people were around and the streets were uncrowded. Note how businessmen carried pistols in their daily activities. The moral of this story is to always guard your food and drink when in a public place, like a bar, restaurant, cafeteria, etc. Sex and money (or lust and greed) are the prime motives for murder in general, and in this story.

7837655,5,6303038719,"D.O.A. (1950) is a black and white murder mystery, starring Edmond O'Brien as an accountant who is trying to solve his own murder.  What this means, is that he finds that he was poisoned by a slow-acting poison (""luminous toxin"") and has only a week or so to live. O'Brien's character is an accountant in a small city Banning, which is an actual city located in Riverside County in between Los Angeles and Palm Springs.  The co-star is Pamela Britton, who plays ""Paula,"" who is O'Brien's secretary and devoted girlfriend.

FLASHBACK PLOT.  The film starts and ends in a police station.  O'Brien enters the police station and proclaims that he was murdered.  His explanation is changed into a real-time drama showing the events as they had actually happened.  At the very end of the movie, the flashback is concluded, and once again we are in the same police station, where O'Brien completes his explanation.  While in the police station, he phones Paula and the last thing he says is her name.  This is similar to the dying words ""Rosebud"" which is uttered by Orson Welles in CITIZEN KANE.

THE MAIN PLOT.  Some of the main plot takes place in the accountant's office in Banning, CA, some takes place in Los Angeles, but most takes place in San Francisco, which is fine with me, because San Francisco is the most photogenic city in the United States.  Edmond O'Brien's real reason to go to San Francisco was to take a vacation, however, one evening he goes to a nightclub to hear jazz music.  In the nightclub, a man who'd been following him switches his drink with a poisoned drink.  The poisoned drink has ""luminous toxin.""  O'Brien feels sick and he takes himself to two hospitals, where physicians in both hospitals give him the same negative prognosis.  The plot is packed with clever twists and turns.  The viewer will be treated to O'Brien's continual stream of clever deductions, as he goes about solving his own murder.  I know of only one detective movie as clever as D.O.A., and that is Chinatown starring Jack Nicholson.

JAZZ NIGHTCLUB.  One of the few relaxing episodes in this movie is the nightclub scene, where the viewer will be treated to a bebop jazz band.  The musicians are actual real-life recording artists, and they include Teddy Buckner (trumpet), Al Wichard (drums), and Shifty Henry (bass).  The cinematography is very intelligent, and the viewer is treated to many closeup images of the musician's fingers dancing about the saxophone valves, and  pirouetting over the bass strings.  Although the jazz nightclub scene is steaming with energy, it is relatively relaxing, because much of the other parts of the scenes include tense gun fights (or threats of gun fights), and chase scenes reminiscent of THE FRENCH CONNECTION, starring Gene Hackman.  As I mentioned above, the jazz nightclub is where O'Brien takes his poisoned drink.",1479340800,,2859,4.881742738589212
