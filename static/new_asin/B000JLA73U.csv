You'll want this in your collection because you'll watch it more than once.  I would have liked Jericho better in the male lead but Kristine Hermosa really pulled it all together.  This series has all of what I love about the Philippines, Louisa's family reminds me of the good and honest people who are my wife's family.",1274918400,,497,4.477777777777778

8151588,5,B000JLA73U,"Wow Pare what a great movie. I sat and watched each video straight through. I didn't realize that this was an 8-part movie until it was 4:30 in the morning. I loved the Catholic message on filipino culture, values and beliefs. Kristina Hermosa has got to be one of the most beautiful women while crying in the movies. Siya na ang favorite filipina actress ko ngayon.",1192233600,10,366,4.5606060606060606
