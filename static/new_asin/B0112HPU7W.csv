7322514,5,B0112HPU7W,Even if you keep the story at bay for what it is this is a great film to learn from. Something to apply as an experiment to a system that your looking to get into. Give it a view at least one. Willing to bet it's better than some films being released in cinema this week.,1439078400,2,271,3.857142857142857
7322545,5,B0112HPU7W,"I think this was may have been Anton Yelchin  last movie I saw this the day before his accident. Such a shame. The movie was a little violent for my taste but was well acted. The whole ""drug war"" premis was so muted it was only to open the door for the violence.",1466467200,,262,3.943396226415094
7322546,1,B0112HPU7W,"This is one of those movies where you can guess the entire plot and outcome after watching the first twenty minutes, and the rest of it is time wasted, wishing you were doing something else. Mediocre casting doesn't help as Anton Yelchin seems best suited on Sesame Street rather than tangling with bad guys on the US / Mexico border. A big thumbs down!!!",1456531200,,355,4.5625
7322547,5,B0112HPU7W,"Great story about two brothers separated when young, re-united when older but with totally different lives. What is the bond between brothers. Two young actors great as brothers. But the best, of course, is actor Vincent D'Onofrio. Vincent plays villains better than anyone, but this character is particularly nasty. I love when a movie keeps me so involved in the story, that it takes me away from real life. Kept my attention. Ending unexpected. Definitely not just a watcher but a keeper. Extras from behind the scenes amazing. Won't give anything away.",1456012800,,556,5.054347826086956
7322548,4,B0112HPU7W,"This movie isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really enjoyed it. It's exactly what you would expect from a Bollywood director making a movie in America, very melodramatic and stagy but with a lot of heart. At times there was almost a Lynchian vibe to things. If you're looking for something different, it's definitely worth watching!",1454198400,,345,4.766666666666667
7322549,1,B0112HPU7W,"A horrible disturbing movie. We stopped it after about a half hour,",1453075200,,67,4.666666666666667

7322551,5,B0112HPU7W,"If you liked the movie Blood Simple, you will probably like this film. While in a sense it is hard-boiled realism, it also has a haunting patina of surrealism. The scene featuring the white horse standing in the house, with moonlight streaming in through the door beatifying its whiteness  is the best of a Dali dream. This films director also knew when to use slow motion to enhance the effect of enchantment.

Like Blood Simple, this too is set in a hyperbole of Texas country. While here I sort of missed the elegiac commentary of M. Emmett Walsh that made such poetry of the older film, Walshs dusty, resigned paean to Texas life hangs in the air. So does sudden, brutal death, which awaits everywhere as a result of random greed and misunderstanding - as a way of being.

The acting is superb. If this film had gotten wider circulation and more publicity, its very possible that Anton Yelchin and Vincent DOnofrio especially might have gotten Academy Award nominations for their unusual portrayals.

Broken Horses has an interesting, intricate premise, without generally being too confusing. It knows what to leave to the imagination. It lets you ponder such questions as exactly what happened to Henchs wife, and who really killed Gabriel Heckum? The answers to such questions leave you speculating, and might ultimately bring you back full-circle to some surprising realizations.

Broken Horses does depart from Blood Simple in one important way though. While the action in Blood Simple tended to confirm Walshs cynical introductory statement that in Texas, out here, you're on your own  a more life-affirming theme runs through this film. Its meaning leans more in the direction of a confirmation that that there might yet be some help out there for you.",1452297600,,1762,4.95593220338983
7322552,3,B0112HPU7W,"Jacob (Anton Yelchin) returns to his desolate hometown and discovers that his child-like brother, Buddy (Chris Marquette) is working for a notorious gang. The gangs ruthless boss (Vincent DOnofrio) has exploited Buddys simple mind and manipulated him into becoming a merciless killer. Jacob realizes the only way to save Buddy is to take down the gang from within. Now for the meat...I got this for Anton Yelchin, I love him BUT he was way too mellow for me in this and I get that is his usual persona but OMG he was so mellow he was comatose. Vincent D'Onofrio who usually annoys the crap out of me is wonderfully malevolent and manipulative. The star has to be Chris Marquette who stuns with his portrayal of Buddy shifting between maniacal and sweet. I will admit I never read the book BUT the movie did lag quite a bit at various parts. Would I recommend???? Tough call as long as you can just view the story and wait for the things to happen.",1452124800,,947,4.543859649122807
7322553,5,B0112HPU7W,I actually rented this because i thought it was another movie very glad I made the mistake.

7322578,2,B0112HPU7W,"This movie had Robert Duvall as lead actor and director. I thought this movie was very poor. I gave it 2-stars because of Robert Duvall, but he failed me. The movie was very predictable and had a very weak plot.",1445817600,,211,4.3
7322579,5,B0112HPU7W,Surprised how much we liked this story!,1444867200,,39,4.714285714285714

7322581,5,B0112HPU7W,An excellent story of loyalty and love. Tearjerker where you root for the killer/hitman. Original? Yes!,1443916800,,103,5.5
7322582,5,B0112HPU7W,"This is a gorgeous film, very well done.  The dialogue seemed a bit unrealistic at first until you realize that the dialogue is overly simple for a reason--to show the simplistic nature of the older brother, Buddy.  Chris Marquette does such an amazing job of drawing you in and making you love his character; Anton Yelchin plays his typical caring, well-intentioned self; both give very believable performances.  I can believe they would be brothers.  Vincent D'Onofrio is completely despicable.  The pace of the film is slow, and it languishes a bit on vast, desolate landscapes, which reflect the mood of the movie and add tension to the story.  There is not much added to the plot; it almost focuses exclusively on the relationships between the characters.  For example, it is not 100% certain what is motivating the war between the bad guys, just pure hatred of each other.  The end snuck up on me and hit me like a ton of bricks, and I cried...a lot.  It is a very moving, artistic film.  If you like Hollywood blockbusters only, this won't be your film.  If you like the work of the Coen Brothers, this film is more suited for you.",1442620800,10,1138,4.64
7322583,5,B0112HPU7W,"FYI  I thought I had a month to watch it but just 24 hours so be careful. I only was half way through but  good grief
the most evil role yet I've see from Vincent D'Onofrio.  Plan to buy it again and watch the rest.",1441497600,3,215,3.7333333333333334

8723531,2,B0112HPU7W,"At times visually beautiful, with the great performances you'd expect from Yeltchin and D'Onoforio, the movie as a whole ultimately fails because of a lack of commitment. A times a crime drama, at times a character study about the meaning of family, it is never quite coherently well done as either.",1515369600,,299,4.882352941176471

8723535,5,B0112HPU7W,"I just finished watching this movie. Absolutely amazing!! Powerhouse performances!! Chris Marquette was phenomenal as the mentally impaired brother. The late great Anton yelchin broke my heart with the younger brother trying his best to save his brother's life. And Vincent D'onofrio was astounding as the particularly evil gang boss. Oscars all around. Glad I own this one. Watching this movie makes me realize that the world has lost a great talent, Anton yelchin, too soon:( He will be greatly missed. But he left behind alot of great movies. RIP Anton",1485734400,3,555,5.1098901098901095
