7622792,4,B01B8836R6,"""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016 release; 106 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of a fictitious film studio in the 1950s producing several films, including the 'prestige' film 'Hail Caesar!, A Tale of the Christ', starring Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney). As the movie opens, we get to know Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), head of production who after going to confession (only 24 hrs. after the previous), gets a girl out of trouble. Meanwhile on the set of 'Hail, Caesar!', it isn't long before a couple of extras manage to drug Baird Whitlock and abduct him. As if all of that isn't enough, Mannix is being courted by Lockheed with a great and generous job offer. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, who most recently charmed us with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Here, the Coen brothers go into another tribute, this time the 1950s Hollywood studio system, still in full force but already past its peak. The Coen brothers bring us a parade of characters, too many to keep track of, and movies within the movie (at least four of them), all the while crafting picture-perfect scenes that are pure eye-candy if nothing else (check: the water ballet scene with Scarlett Johansson's character; the dance and tap foot scene with Channing Tatum's character, etc.). The movie is carried by the performances, more so than the story, and for me the big revelation is Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle, the singing cowboy who now must deliver in a regular speaking part. A number of the big names only appear briefly (Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, etc.). There is a wonderful score. courtesy of composer Carter Burwell, who seems to be everywhere these days (he's got 3 other films in the theaters right now, including ""Carol"" for which he received an Oscar nomination, ""Anomalisa' and ""The Finest Hours""). Bottom lime: the movie works best as something to enjoy in the moment, without thinking about it too much. In that sense, while this is of course a fine movie, it is also one of the Coen brothers' more forgettable movies.

""Hail, Caesar!"" opened nationwide last weekend, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (and leaning heavily towards seniors, I might add). As the movie's end titles started to roll, the guy seated next to me asked his wife ""what was the point of this movie?"". The answer is that there is no point to this movie, it is made to be enjoyed in the moment, with a good dose of nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age. If you have a chance to see ""Hail, Caesar!"", be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusion.",1455321600,3,2931,4.711500974658869
7622793,4,B01B8836R6,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Hail, Caesar!""

1. This movie is fiction, but it's based on a real guy, Eddie Mannix, who worked as a ""fixer"" in Hollywood, hiding and cleaning up various scandals that stars were involved in.

2. Written, produced, and directed by the Coen Brothers, it takes place over 28 hours, when Eddie (played by Josh Brolin) keeps an eye on the stars of four movies being produced. Would that it were so simple.

3. The cast is great; not only are Coen Brothers' staples in it (like Frances McDormand), it adds newer stars like Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Scarlett Johansson. The only problem is that the cast is so large and there are so many things going on, that most stars have a very brief time on screen.

4. Fans of 1950's Hollywood will recognize versions of real Hollywood players - George Clooney is basically Kirk Douglas, Alden Ehrenreich is a ""singing cowboy"" like Kirby Grant, Scarlett Johannson is Esther Williams, Channing Tatum is Gene Kelley, Veronica Osario is Carmen Miranda, and Tilda Swinton plays twin gossip columnists, who are obviously meant to be Hedda Hopper.

5. The Coen's really get the feel of bad 1950's Hollywood films right, as they both spoof the movie-making process and teach us about it.

6. I guess you can say the main plot is about Baird Whitlock (Clooney), who is kidnapped and set up in a scandal. But there a lot of stories here, and that one isn't really all that important in the big picture.

7. The scene in which Mannix tries to get the approval of various religious leaders for the biblical epic being made (which is the title of this movie) is one of the funniest parts of the film. And if you read the very end of the credits, a hidden joke is revealed to you about it.

8. As usual, the Coen Brothers' strengths in dialogue and atmosphere are in full effect.

9. This is really kind of an insider's spoof of Hollywood - people that don't know much about the Hollywood process or the history of movies may find this movie to be kind of boring. But for fans of the Coen Brothers, and those who have a knowledgeable love of movies, this is one to be savored.",1455321600,117,2133,4.505181347150259
7622794,1,B01B8836R6,My family went to see this. We all thought it was bad. I can't even recommending renting it.,1454976000,14,92,4.166666666666667
7622795,5,B01B8836R6,"This one has been on my must-see list for months! It has a cast to die for, writers and directors I admire, and the plot is irresistible (I love stories about show business)!

Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (I've been a fan all the way back to 1984's ""Blood Simple"") and set in 1950s Hollywood, we watch a movie studio fixer try to keep four movies on track, on budget, and on time. Problem is, a star has disappeared ....and there is a casting problem ...and there is an unexpected pregnancy ...and...

Here is that cast to die for:
  * Josh Brolin (""Sicario"") Eddie Mannix is the fixer but some things are tough to fix! Where will he find the money for the ransom and how will he protect the reputation of an unmarried, pregnant star? Is he going to accept that tempting job offer from Lockheed? Brolin is convincing as an honorable, hard-working man who wants to do the right thing.
  * Ralph Fiennes (""Spectre"") Laurence Lorenz is a much-respected director. He has been assigned a new star for his latest artistic production and now he needs it fixed! Fiennes does a slow burn sooo well.
  * Alden Ehrenreich (""Blue Jasmine"") Hobie Doyle is Columbia Studio's resident singing cowboy. Re-assigning him to a costume drama is complicated... Ehrenreich is a terrific discovery. His straight shooter sings, strums the guitar, does rope tricks and innocently frustrates Ralph Fiennes' director. Oh! And he looks like 50s star Audie Murphy. Remember him?
  * Scarlett Johansson (""The Avengers"") DeeAnna Moran is the studio's mermaid; she stars in lovely synchronized water ballets but now she is in a real pickle: Can Eddie fix this one? Bad publicity would destroy her (and hurt the studio). Johannson is a hoot!
  * George Clooney (""Tomorrowland"") Superstar Baird Whitlock has gone to ground. No one on the set of ""Hail Caesar, a Tale of Christ's Life"" knows if he's having an existential crisis or is drinking again. Now it looks like he's being held for ransom by a group of Communists. Clooney has never been funnier and he wears a Roman Centurion's uniform from beginning to end. Nice legs...
  * Channing Tatum (""Magic Mike"") Burt Gurney is the go-to guy for studio musicals. He sings, he dances, he.... Oh, you know... But there is more to him than meets the eye.
  * Jonah Hill (""Moneyball"") is Joseph Silverman, a stony-faced fellow you can rely on.
  * Tilda Swinton (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is gossip columnist Thora Thacker and her gossip columnist sister Thessaly. Each dame is hot on the trail of her own scoop. I have enjoyed Swinton's recent move to comedies; she has a real flair.
  * Frances McDormand (""Olive Kitteridge"") is hilarious as chain-smoking film editor C.C. Calhoon.
  * Many others are worthy of note, but space does not permit. LOVED the fixer's assistant, the Carmen Miranda type, the kidnappers (and their dog), and the submarine. Yeah, I said submarine.

This frantic comedy captures the phony morality of 1950s Hollywood: Every marriage is made in heaven and all single women are saints. It also captures the zeal of those gossip doyennes: They rule the press, control the public's perception of the stars and battle each other for every scoop and expos!

Rated PG-13, we can expect a smattering of profanity and implied promiscuity, but no F bombs or sweaty bodies; we get to peek behind the curtain of four genre productions: a drama, a western, a water ballet, and a tap-dancing musical. It was simpler times, e.g., our hero goes to Confession when he sneaks a cigarette after he had promised...; the kidnappers are what I see as an anti-Trumbo bunch, these guys are Hollywood screenwriters who are active, working Communists. Their philosophical discussions are a stitch and one elderly guy thinks they have kidnapped Clark Gable!

Don't miss this one.",1454889600,5,3807,4.837962962962963
7622796,4,B01B8836R6,"As with many of the Coen Brothers films, this one will most likely be loved by critics and avid film watchers while others will be disappointed.  So let me say up front, that if you are looking forward to extended performances by Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson and even George Clooney you will be disappointed.  But if you want to see them shine in their limited screen time, you wont.

The story is set sometime before 1960 when sword and sandal blockbusters ruled the silver screen.  Eddie Mannix (terrific Josh Brolin, Sicario) runs the day to day operations of Capital Pictures in Hollywood.  Hes the go-to guy when it comes to babysitting a tempestuous actress, or bailing out a drunken actor.  A fixer.  Eddie is called to action when his biggest movie star and the lead in the titled movie, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped by cadre of communist sympathizers who work in the industry.  Think Trumbo.  Eddie and the studio are being extorted to the tune of $100K.

Johansson plays DeeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams-like movie star who was featured in so many MGM water extravaganzas of the era.  Hill is Joseph Silverman, a clerical fixer who is going to take care of DeeAnnas recently discovered pregnancy.  Tilda Swinton proves again, shes got real comedic chops playing twins and competitive tabloid reporters.  Tatum is terrific in a Gene Kelly-like dance sequence.  Frances McDormand, who is married to Joel Coen, has a brief but hilarious appearance as a camera operator.  Stealing the movie however is Alden Ehrenreicha (Beautiful Creatures and Blue Jasmine) a relatively unknown actor who plays Hobie Doyle, an aw-shucks cowboy, relegated to singing cowboy movies.  When hes tagged to be a replacement actor in a sophisticated drama, he uncomfortably dons a tux.  In one of the best scenes, hes tutored by the fey director played with relish by Ralph Fiennes.

Eddie is trying to focus on finding the captured Whitlock so he can complete his scenes for the big movie.  But his love of his job conflict with a huge potential contract with Lockheed where he would be guaranteed a 9-5 job with tenure.  Lockheeds recruiter tries to reel in Eddie by showing him a picture of the H-Bomb being tested in the Pacific.  We were there he exclaims.

The Coens show a talent for recreating the older films from the 1950s.  The film-within-a-film sequences (even cut to a 1.33:1 aspect ratio) with Johansson, Tatum, and Ehrenreicha are really well done.  If you're a fan of movies that go back more than a decade I think youll find the film funny and full of entertainment.  Recommended.",1454803200,9,2618,4.882086167800454
7622797,3,B01B8836R6,"... more...

from this, given the cast and the directors. This is more of a 2.25 - 2.5 stars review but I rounded up.

VAGUE SPOILER

Visually it is like stepping back into the golden age of Hollywood but there is no payoff for any of the multiple story lines. This film just takes a day out of the lives of the cast and does nothing much with it.

SPECIFIC SPOILERS AHEAD

Clooney's character is kidnapped by commie writers at the behest of a singing and dancing Channing Tatum who is secretly a communist who wants to be taken back to the USSR to become... wait for it... Soviet Man.

Yes.

You read that correctly.

The main character is Brolin's Studio Head who is constantly putting out metaphorical fires all day, which consist of:

Getting the movie, Hail Caesar!, a tale about the Christ as seen by a Roman General, approved by 4 religious leaders who do a rather excellent job
of making it clear why many people are unable to use logic and reason to reconcile different beliefs;
an innocent (cough) star who doesn't want to get married for the 3rd time but is pregnant;
rebranding a a physical action (westerns) star into a sophisticated leading man (the scenes where he is trying to be complicated are both extremely funny and painful to watch as Ralph Fiennes is driven to frustration);
Dealing with the kidnapping and ransom of Baird Whitlock (Clooney);
Dealing with twin gossip columnists that have a serious case of sibling rivalry and clearly need therapy;
making sure to confess at least once every day, usually about how he is still smoking despite promising his wife to quit; and last, dealing with a job offer from Lockheed to run a 'real-world ' business and not a circus.

Sorry but I am getting sidetracked. As I said before, there is no... payoff to any of the story-lines other than Baird gets to take a day off and the studio loses $100,000 in ransom money. There are no other major outcomes.

I walked out of the theater thinking I should have gone to see the Pride & Prejudice & Zombies flick. If you like the Cohen brothers, go see it and decide for your self. If you don't, skip it and watch something else.",1454716800,3,2136,4.522077922077922
7622798,5,B01B8836R6,"This is a great movie by any measure. It's an entertainment on the surface, with amazing stunts, huge sets, technical dance numbers, entertaining ""bits"", great music both as background and foreground, beautiful places and cinematography, and interesting characters that tie all these things together. Attempting to disassemble any part of this juggling act in the act of judging the Movie is to miss the whole point of the movie.
  The movie is designed to work as a ""meta"" meta possibly meta again if you think about it.  Whether or not you agree with the espoused mature outlook, the body politic if you will, hidden within the clever script,  whether or not you choose to pull outward and see how actually genius the entire presentation is as a whole, you can't help but be entertained by this product of Hollywood about Hollywood using the ""language"" of Hollywood in incredibly clever ways.  Like I said;  pure genius, and, I left with a smile on my face.  It's almost like this movie bookends Barton Fink.  It certainly revisits certain character types found in other Coen brothers movies revealing new perspectives and insight, apparent as the great ""observers"" of our era follow the normal course of maturing.  This truly is an entertainment that must be viewed more than once but only time will tell if it's a Classic.",1454716800,16,1326,4.883928571428571

I'm not a huge George Clooney fan (though I enjoyed him in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck""),  but I do like some of the Coen Brothers pictures, so I took a chance and I really liked it. The story was an engaging and moved along at a tolerable pace; I was never tempted to fast forward the movie as I do with some others (""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing MO"" and ""Lady Bird"").  The cast was excellent and who could go wrong with Ralph Fiennes, Frances McDormand and Tatum Channing, Scarlett Johansson were very good and I loved the wooden cowboy actor played by Alden Ehrenreich Tobey. Over the decades movies have parodied themselves and point out the obvious flaws of tinsel town; ""Sunset Blvd"", and ""The Player"" come to mind. Also, another Coen creation, ""Barton Fink"". One somewhat grotesque Hollywood classic from 1975 and forgotten by many was ""The Day of the Locust"". With all those previous movies in my memory, I found this story very original and the twist at the end was good along with the great undertones of the mood in Hollywood and its' somewhat controversial politics of the day.",1529712000,,1196,4.636792452830188

The story behind movie is sort of 'duh' preachiness and strife for the sake of browbeating the audience. You know, like a lot of 'preachy' messages Hollywood seeks to browbeat us with through everything from storyline, to casting stars that defy probability and wind up unintentionally exposing themselves and the mass media industry for being the type of preaching hypocrites they use as villains in their movies.

Alden Ehrenreich (as Hobie Doyle) and Ralph Fiennes (as Laurence Laurentz) share a sketch in the middle of the story that is worth the price of admission.

This isn't a story about any of the random events that occur, fun as many of them are.  It's primarily about a day in the life of Eddie Mannix, the Fixer, about the inflated egos and resultant chaos he has to deal with on his job, while at the same time he is worrying on a personal level about a heavy push from a large corporation outside of the movie industry to recruit him for a job that would be a lot saner, easier, and likely pay better.  And, seeing how effectively he strong-arms into shape all the lunacy that goes on on the movie lot, it's understandable why they want him.  Meanwhile, there are endless in-jokes about the Hollywood of the time and the fairly awful but profitable mass entertainment that is finally distilled out of all the confusion.  It's an effective storytelling technique, so that we see only choice bits of the storyline about each of the characters without having to get bogged down with any one of them.  It also permits you to enjoy each wonderful character and each clever little set-piece as they occur, even if they don't seem to relate to any other part of the movie.  Of course, the Coens do manage to pull a number of the threads together one way or another, and ultimately all of them are resolved satisfactorily.  Maybe even more than a day in Mannix's life, it's really just a day in the life of late Golden Age Hollywood (and perhaps a tribute to the creative exasperation that goes into the making of movies in any era).

I laughed a lot. But don't expect a satisfying overall film experience. This is not Clooney's best performance. Just doesn't work.

If you don't want to see film sets doing a Caesar epic, synchronized swimming, a sailor song & dance and a cowboy star then you might want to pass over this one. It was fun to watch and had some social commentary on the times but Josh Brolin held it all together and even George Clooney did an excellent job.

7622840,3,B01B8836R6,"Since 1984 the Coen brothers have supplied us with a constant stream of consistently high quality films which have established them at the peak of their profession. Each of their films is a major event when it appears and now with Hail, Caesar! (2016) we come to their 17th and (they claim) final feature. If this is really true then its sad to think that we can no longer look forward to what this talented duo will do next. As with Powell & Pressburger maybe they know their best work is behind them, that they will not make anything together better than Barton Fink, Fargo or No Country for Old Men, and have decided to seek inspiration apart. Or maybe like their regular cinematographer Roger Deakins they have taken a dislike to the new digital age and have decided to simply walk away. Whatever the reason, it is rather sad that their swansong feature doesnt really measure up.

Light and inconsequential, Hail, Caesar! is a comedy focusing on a studio exec Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) working at Capitol Pictures whose main job in 1951 is to keep his roster of stars out of trouble and toeing the official studio line. These stars are the cue for a series of cameo turns from established stars of today who are involved in the various films being made at the time, each of which in turn cue sequences which don't have a lot to do with each other. Theres Scarlett Johansson as Esther Williams-like DeeAnna Moran in an extended swimming pool number riffing both on Williams films and on Busby Berkeley overhead numbers from the 40s. Shes pregnant by one of the studios star directors (Christopher Lambert), but Mannix has to find a way to hide it from the public who think this foul-mouthed harridan is a cherubic innocent. Then theres Alden Ehrenreich as Gene Autry-like Hobie Doyle, a singing cowboy who we get to see first in a delightful Western spoof and then miscast playing in a comedy of manners directed by the Nol Coward-like Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Channing Tatum turns up as Gene Kelly-like Burt Gurney in an On the Town musical spoof number (cue lots of naughty prancing sailor boys) while biggest film on the lot at the moment happens to be a Biblical epic titled (youve guessed it) Hail, Caesar! based on such follies as Quo Vadis and The Robe, and starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) in the Charlton Heston role as a Roman general who is eventually awed by a vision of Christ on the cross. Whitlock provides the main narrative thread when he is kidnapped and we follow his ordeal. Mannix has to recover Whitlock pronto as he is assailed by gossip columnists Hedda Hopper/Louella Parsons-like Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton), co-opted by the Lockheed Corporation looking to engage his professional services, and is wrestling with his smoking addiction. Main narrative thread is perhaps pushing it as the film doesnt really cohere at all. The kidnapping is just not interesting enough to sustain the film and despite Michael Gambons witty po-serious narration we watch alternatively amused and bemused by the various lumps thrown at us with nothing substantial to anchor them together for our attention.

This is all very disappointing in view of the fact that it was the Coens who made delicious post-modern pastiches on Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks and Frank Capra (O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Hudsucker Proxy), riffed hilariously on Hawks The Big Sleep in The Big Lebowski, played around with Hammett/Cain film noir conventions (in Blood Simple, Millers Crossing and The Man Who Wasnt There) and sent up the 40s studio system in Barton Fink, the marvelous film that provided the Capitol Pictures label used here. These films all prove the Coens are super-cine-literate and can be trusted to produce their brand of postmodern intertextual pastiche in a knowing, wickedly intelligent, and always funny style. With credentials such as these Hail Caesar! should be a delight, but sadly, it just isnt. In fact even hardline Coenites will have a hard time accepting it.

The give-away perhaps is that while all the Coens previous cine-literate excursions have worked off proven masterpieces which have entered the critical pantheon, Hail, Caesar! riffs off 50s films which seemed cruddy even when they first came out. Threatened by TV and shrinking audiences studios had to resort to desperate measures to hook audiences back to theaters and the film spoofs we see are spoofs of these desperate measures. This has the effect of making the Coens look like they are scorning these films, taking the mickey out of them, and taking the mickey out of audiences who watched and enjoyed them. Older viewers probably will not take to what for them looks like a sour attack aimed at them through these films while younger viewers will probably watch not getting the film references at all, the attack going straight over their heads. Which leaves the question of just what audience exactly are the Coens addressing here?

While the big picture is left decidedly loose and unfocused, the film does provide us with a series of succulent bon-bons which are undeniably entertaining. I love Fiennes take on the effete director trying to get his cowboy to say his lines properly and Johansson does the bitchy star turn well enough to wonder if this really is Johansson we are watching here. Clooney has always been a born comic and as in O Brother Where Art Thou? he delights in playing stupidity (slapstick stuff with his Roman sword) and delivering ponderous Biblical epic portentousness with fake aplomb. Best of all are sequences involving a studio hand addressing Jesus on the cross about what breakfast hes been allotted, and an editor (Frances McDormand) almost throttling herself when her scarf gets caught in her editing table. The film is supremely well-shot by Deakins to differentiate clearly between the various styles needed for the various genres we see. Brolin anchors the film as best he can given the lightweight script and his little duels with the Swintons Thacker twins are further highlights. But these things taken together are precious little to come away with when we know the Coens are capable of so much more. For the most part we are forced to simply watch musical numbers or mock historical epic scenes (none of which advance the plot one iota) with our feet up and our brains firmly checked in at the door. Maybe thats the point  perhaps we shouldnt enter a Burger King expecting a fillet steak. But I usually come to a Coens expecting to have to sift through the postmodern pastiche, lay out the texts and grasp the delicious subtleties. Here the texts are already laid out for us with prosaic blandness  this film is not so much postmodern as postiche. A disappointing footnote to a sparkling series of wonderful films.",1513814400,,6786,4.8811795316565485

The cast is excellent as you would expect (Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Channing Tatum, Ralph Fiennes, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson among others).

7622873,3,B01B8836R6,"First reviewed at tbirdstudios.com:

From Fargo to A Serious Man, the beautifully twisted No Country for Old Men and the cult classic The Big Lebowski, no one can deny that Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the most interesting and versatile filmmakers in Hollywood. Whether its subtle comedy or shades of darkness, spirituality or the surreal, the brothers seem incapable of making a bad film.

And Hail Caesar! is no exception.

Set in the 1950s, the film follows real-life Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) as he works to solve the movie studios many problems. If a stars behavior proves expensive, less-than-wholesome, or a pending public relations disaster, Mannix is called in to get the actor/actress back in line.

However, the kidnapping of lead star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) complicates matters, as Whitlock was the eponymous Caesar for the studios latest epic drama. With filming costs threatening to explode without him, Mannix prepares the ransom while ducking the overly-inquisitive press.

The movie divides itself between this main thread and several minor plots with various other characters. Some of these threads tie-in to the overall story by coincidence or necessity. Others are just interesting bits of micro-fiction and red herrings that fall between the cracks, like DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) and her pregnancy outside of wedlock, or Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who cant seem to make the transition from Western action star to a bonhomme thespian. Though very little beats watching Channing Tatum perform a ludicrous song and dance routine as a Naval seaman just before shipping out.

Although Mannix is based on a historic person, the other characters and themes tend to be composites of Hollywood archetypes, often hinting at the histories and gossip surrounding their real-life counterparts. Examples include a detail not unlike Clark Gables alleged hit-and-run incident or the communists ties of the screenwriters (which was recently discussed in the biographic movie Trumbo with far less cheek).

At its heart, Hail Caesar! covers Hollywood at a very different time, and gently satirizes it. Unfortunately, the movie will be remembered more as one of those recent films that divides the critics from the audiences. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85% fresh certification, but also reports a general dislike for it among reporting audience members.

Why is this? Two theories come to mind. The first is that the film showed too much about how the sausage is made. And the second is the possibility rests in that it teased movies we claim are classics, and perhaps poking fun at these pieces of nostalgia was an unwise call.

And that is a shame, as I found Hail Caesar! a quite enjoyable experience, and one Id recommend cinema fans to at least consider.",1493510400,,2802,5.195121951219512

7622875,2,B01B8836R6,"Like many Coen Brothers films, ""Hail Caesar"" is an excellent idea for a movie which starts hilariously but then fades away and leaves the audience with the unsettling feeling that an opportunity for terrific comedy was set aside in favor of weighty, pedantic, self-important ""intelligent story telling.""  The first ten minutes are extremely funny, but an hour later- around the time you are being subjected to an overlong, unfunny musical piece from the ""Swinging Dingy"" (ugh, yes, very funny to eleven year olds in the audience) you find yourself wondering where the funny went.

(The musical number is actually the second of two ridiculously long, Ok-We-Get-It-How-About-Returning-to-the-Film detours, the first being a salute to Esther Williams which introduces a character who has no actual impact on the story at all but I guess is there to remind us that Scarlett Johanssen is in this movie....sort of.)

The scenes with the Communist party members could be hysterical but instead are heavy-handed and seem to exist so that the Coen Brothers can engage in a little self-indulgent lecturing.  Like so much of the last two-thirds of the film, they do nothing to drive the ""plot"" (using that term VERY losely)  and can easily be skipped.

The cliche'd ""Will the main character give up this crummy job for something much better"" storyline is especially aggravating this time around because Brolin's character has a wife and kids he never sees because of that crummy job- a point made rather poignantly when we see him arrive home way too late for dinner with the family, leave for work way too early for breakfast with the family, and leaving his children presents as they sleep.  His wife agrees that the job offer with Lockheed would be a blessing because it would mean reduced hours and better pay.  Yet at the end, in an anticlimax which still leaves us irritated with ""Eddie Mannix,"" he decides to keep the lousy ""fixer"" job- which makes him happy because ""its just right,"" never mind that wife and family he rarely gets to be with.  Ugh.  Just, Ugh.

Again- a film with SO much promise which just crumbles away as it progresses.  Pity.",1492819200,,2143,4.905817174515235

Where we have a jaunt through the underbelly of old Hollywood which finds not the fiery hell of the tortured artist but the upbeat splash of synchronised swimming, On the Town type toe-tapping and toga-wearing biblical balderdash. The film pinballs between AWOL movie stars, red-scare nightmares and Bikini Atoll bomb tests, while raising important questions of whether God is still very angry with the world, and how to make a lasso out of spaghetti, and the secret of balancing a bunch of bananas on your head, and they say it is all down to the hips, lips, eyes and thighs, apparently I am informed.

Its 1951, and the motion picture industry is responding to the threat of television with colourful choreography, escapist romances and biblical epics. We open with a choir, a crucifix and a rosary, leading us to Eddie Mannix [Josh Brolin] in the confessional. Its been 24 hours since his last confession, and Eddie Mannix has racked with the guilt of lying to his wife about smoking. But theres no rest for the wicked, and 3:00am finds studio fixer Eddie Mannix, an altogether more decent version of his real-life namesake, and saving a starlet from a possible French postcard situation before checking into Capitol Pictures where HAIL, CAESAR! A Tale of the Christ, where they say tongue in cheek, Divine presence is to be shot is in full swing.

The high-powered Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix has been enjoying an on-screen mini-renaissance, and now the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers lavish throwback to an earlier era of industry damage control, as overseen here by the character of Eddie Mannix, a fictionalised composite of the real-life studio executive Joseph Edgar Allen, John ""Eddie"" Mannix and his head of publicity, Howard Strickling served as head of publicity for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer pictures from the late 1920s into the early 1950s. The various scandals that Joseph Edgar Allen, John ""Eddie"" Mannix and Howard Strickling covered up during their decades working together at M-G-M could easily furnish several films of their own, but Ethan Coen and Joel Coen Brothers generally steer clear of salaciousness in favour of a jaundiced but affectionate character study, treating Josh Brolins  eternally put-upon as Eddie Mannix as a beacon of relative sanity and intelligence in a world overrun by irrationality, venality and corruption.

Eddie Mannix, a hard-working Catholic family man first seen unburdening his soul to a priest, and not just because he has sneaked a few cigarettes behind his wifes back. Its the 1950s, and as the designated fixer for Capitol Pictures, played here in a sly amalgam of the Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and SONY film lots, plus the courtyard of Los Angeles Union Station, Eddie Mannixis tasked with preserving the illusion of Hollywood glamour and propriety at a time of pervasive moral crackdown and socio-political upheaval, taking not-always-savoury steps to ensure that production runs smoothly and top talents stay out of the headlines.

That can mean anything from smacking around an up-and-coming actress caught in an illicit photo shoot, to arranging for prized star DeeAnna Moran [Scarlett Johansson] who terrifically brassy if a bit underused) to secretly adopt her own out-of-wedlock child, a twist inspired directly by the real-life Eddie Mannixs similar arrangement for the actress Loretta Young. It also means enforcing the studios questionable decision to cast the handsome, dumb-as-a-stump cowboy Hobie Doyle [Alden Ehrenreich] who is totally superb, an audience hit in a recent string of Westerns, in an elegant parlour drama called Merrily We Dance, to the quiet chagrin of the prestigious director Laurence Laurentz [Ralph Fiennes], whose patient attempts to steer the hopeless Hobie Doyle through a single line of dialogue provide the film with one of its most delicious scenes and ultimately this is one of the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers jolliest and most carefree films and quite a surprise considering its subject matter.

Generally, when the inner workings of Hollywood are shown on screen, for example in A Star Is Born and The Bad and The Beautiful, and the studio system are depicted as a hotbed of viciousness, egotism and backstabbing. In HAIL, CAESAR! it is a magical Hollywood like world from which unhappiness seems to have been banished and the sun is always shining. Everyone is cheerful. Even the super-bitchy gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both played by Tilda Swinton) aren't that vicious really. And one of the delights of the film is its collection of comic cameo performances.

There is a brilliant Gene Kelly dance like sequence involving a lot of randy sailors in a bar, led by Channing Tatum. We see scenes from  Hobie Doyles western Lazy Ol Moon, as well as lots of slaves and the Romans beneath the crucifix in HAIL, CAESAR! itself. Were taken into the cutting room where a chain-smoking editor Frances McDormand lets her scarf get too close to her equipment and nearly chocked to death.

HAIL, CAESAR! is basically a day in the life of this studio boss, whose job is his religion and Josh Brolin, in a heart-and-soul performance, takes this crazy world of the film industry in showing us that he is a man surrounded by nut jobs and plays it for real and is just totally tremendous in how he solves many problems that arise. ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned"" are the first words we hear from Eddie Mannix, a married Catholic who exasperates his priest in Confession by asking forgiveness on an almost daily basis. On his own, Eddie Mannix is an insecure mess and prowling the studio, and definitely gives everyone that he is a very scary lion.

Working for Capitol Pictures makes this ex-bouncer an executive baby-sitter and what babies. Scarlett Johansson is a treat as the studio's swim-star sweetheart and think Esther Williams, but with a mouth like a gun moll. Channing Tatum is a knockout as a song-and-dance man, and think Gene Kelly with a political agenda and definitely Channing Tatum so nails his joyous tap routine with a chorus of sailors that you long to see a musical built around him. And cheers to the terrific Alden Ehrenreich as the studio's cowboy star and think Roy Rogers, a drawling Hicksville who is forced to star as an urban sophisticate, a role for which he is unforgettably unsuited and it is howlingly funny to watch a vexed British director, a priceless Ralph Fiennes trying to guide him through countless takes of the line ""Would that it 'twere so simple,"" and the scene is one for the comedy time capsule.

You don't really notice a plot until the studio's star of stars, Baird Whitlock [George Clooney], gets kidnapped during production of a biblical epic HAIL, CAESAR! and George Clooney has a blast adding Baird Whitlock to the series of idiots he's played for the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers in O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty. It's blasphemous fun watching him blow his lines in a cathartic scene with a crucified Christ. Bair Whitlock takes nothing seriously, not even being a hostage. That's why Eddie Mannix roughs him up hard. Trying to stay moral in this Hollywood Babylon, Eddie Mannix wrestles with a cosmic question: Should he put his faith in the God of a Job or the unseen studio deity who phones in his commandments, where Eddie Mannix tries to sweat it out in style.

But their film never loses its exhilarating buoyancy. The Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers love these debauched people and the different genre films they turn out with such hilarious glee. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, production designer Jess Gonchor and costume designer Mary Zophres create visual bliss. HAIL, CAESAR! is a valentine to the fly-on-the-wall filmmaking, from two control freaks. And everything that is totally nihilistic despair is included, and works like a charm and it is not easy to whip up a fizzy throwaway, that's also very serious at times, but also very simple at times. Yet the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers pull it off in great style and they are totally and utterly indispensable. It deserves however a great deal of credit for the way it is all put together. The editing, sound, and visuals are all so striking that the film will hopefully pick up a gong or two eventually when the awards season arrives. In this regard, I feel that the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers deserve recognition as directors, editors and screenplay without doubt.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures and Working Title Blu-ray release HAIL, CAESAR! have once again brought us a superb and stunning 1080p encoded image release, with an equally wonderful 1.85:1 aspect ratio especially showing us the love and devotion of giving us the impression of the Golden Age of Hollywood and Roger Deakins definitely brings that out in the presentation of this film, and especially the Blu-ray does all that is necessary to let you see all the wonderful detail that went into bringing the world of big Hollywood studio sets to life. Shot on film, you get an incredibly clear picture that maintains the feel this film was attempting to achieve. It only becomes more of an appreciation once you think about the variety of different film styles we see all at once, given the nature of the story. You get a great depth of movement that is wonderful and smooth, as well as a fine clarity between the background and foreground. Black levels are deep and inky, with a good amount of shadow in this film and it all manages to look quite wonderful. Colours are so totally vivid throughout the film, that really pops out of the screen and the film has so much to offer, especially with the brilliant sets and elaborate costumes, which really make for a beautiful coloured filled experience. As to the look of all the actors featured in this film, Roger Deakins made sure there is a great amount of clarity in all their facial textures throughout, especially George Clooney in his Roman costume and how we see his oh so much tanned skin and his well-defined legs throughout the film. It is all there for everyone to see and overall the image quality we get presented is brought out in the best possible taste, as Kenny Everett would all tell us. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures and Working Title Blu-ray release HAIL, CAESAR! brings us a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The film sounds really great and very precise overall. The various film sets certainly allow for a level of variety throughout the film and that is very welcome. The different channels get some moments that really shine and especially given some of the bigger moments in the film, especially when a thunderstorm erupts all around you. The audio department has put in plenty of work to create a terrific atmospheric sound mixes, despite being mainly around the studio film set. The surround work is handled properly to provide good amounts of balance, making really good use of the various channels available. This is very much a dialogue related film and everyone is heard loud and clear.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Directing Hollywood [2016] [1080p] [1.85:1] [4:11] In this love letter to the Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers, everyone involved in the making of the fil discuss why they all said ""yes"" to the Coen Brothers when approached for their parts in the film. Essentially, this is a short feature on why everyone loves both Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. We also get to hear and discuss how this picture came to exist, what went into getting it actually made and how much everyone involved in working with the Coen Brothers were keen without any hesitation. Contributors include George Clooney [Baird Whitlock], Channing Tatum [Burt Gurney], Tilda Swinton [Thessally & Thora Thacker], Alden Ehrenreich [Hobie Doyle], Ralph Fiennes [Laurence Laurentz], Josh Brolan [Eddie Mannix], Robert Graf [Executive Producer] and Scarlett Johansson [DeeAnna Moran].

Special Feature: The Stars Align [2016] [1080p] [1.85:1] [11:34] Here once again we get some more behind-the-scenes view of the making of the film, along with more intimate interviews and plot overview, especially with some of the cast members who talk in front of the camera to talk about their respective characters and appreciation for the feature film and of course working with the brilliant Cohen Brothers and the way they like to make their films. Again, it's not deep but it is amusing enough to watch once. Contributors include George Clooney [Baird Whitlock], Josh Brolan [Eddie Mannix], Ralph Fiennes [Laurence Laurentz], Robert Graf [Executive Producer], Alden Ehrenreich [Hobie Doyle], Tilda Swinton [Thessally & Thora Thacker], Channing Tatum [Burt Gurney] and Scarlett Johansson [DeeAnna Moran].

Special Feature: An Era Of Glamour [2016] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:22] This is slightly more interesting and looks at the production design and the massive undertaking necessary to recreate the Golden Era of that period in Hollywood. All of the costumes in HAIL, CAESAR! are absolutely fantastic, and there should definitely be a special feature dedicated to them, instead we barely gloss over the creation of the costumes. Once again we get to share some insight into the importance of getting the wardrobe and costuming period accurate for the feature. This is sadly slightly shorter than it could have been, but what we view is very interesting. Contributors include Robert Graf [Executive Producer], Jess Gonchor [Production Designer], Mary Zophres [Costume Designer], Scarlett Johansson [DeeAnna Moran], Channing Tatum [Burt Gurney], George Clooney [Baird Whitlock], Josh Brolan [Eddie Mannix], Ralph Fiennes [Laurence Laurentz] and Tilda Swinton [Thessally & Thora Thacker].

Special Feature: Magic Of A Bygone Era [2016] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:01] This extra is specifically focuses on two of the films major set pieces, the impressive tap-dancing sequence, the underwater Esther William type number, seeing the Choreography workout for the dance numbers and  to explain the intricacies of putting together the more complex dance sequences in the film. It is reasonably interesting, but sadly cut far too short. Contributors include Scarlett Johansson [DeeAnna Moran], Channing Tatum [Burt Gurney], Robert Graf [Executive Producer], Christopher Gattelli [No Dames Choreographer], George Clooney [Baird Whitlock], Josh Brolan [Eddie Mannix] and Mesha Kussman [Swimming Choreographer].

Finally, as far as 2016 stands, HAIL, CAESAR! is  firm favourite film to add to my list, as well as others all jostling for positioning for even multiple viewings because of so many twists and turns throughout the film and at times it is hilarious to boot. The Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Brothers are just fantastic directors who know how to craft a film and how to shoot it so well. It is a film for moviemakers fans and committed audiences of this genre who aren't so much interested in indulgent moviemaking but a slice of escapism, pure nostalgic Hollywood style. This is the cast and crew having fun, and even if the movie isn't a straight-up Comedy, its sense of humour and relaxed approach, even to some serious material thrown in for good measure and makes this one of the more inspiring and enjoyable ""Hollywood on Hollywood"" film genre out there. Universal Pictures UK Blu-ray release of HAIL, CAESAR! is brilliant and is also a sublime tongue in cheek sarcastic comedy classic, with laugh a minute in Hollywood jokes and again boasts a stunning terrific video image, a good solid audio experience, and a few supplements to make this Blu-ray release well worth adding to your Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

And I love films which expose to varying degrees the flimsy, yet ironclad facade of the old Hollywood system. Funny how they made Eddie Mannix into such a pious saint in such a filthy business. The film ""Hollywoodland"" certainly paints him in another, more accurate way. Nods to their ridiculing of the Hedda Hopper types, the hypocritical aspects of organized religions, and the ""RED SCARE"". I wonder which one was Dalton Trumbo? Hilarious how they made the 1940s dance number into an utterly homoerotic scene. The only thing that didn't ring true was that a singing cowboy B movie would never rate an A movie premiere.

7622926,5,B01B8836R6,"The first time I saw it, the film left me a bit befuddled. It took me a second time of seeing the film to truly appreciate it. Part of my initial confusion is that there were so many subplots going through the movie. That, plus I wasn't expecting the Cohen brothers to make a satire/comedy.

Anyway. The title of the movie is the title of the movie being filmed in the movie, sometime in the 1950s. Got that? Anyway, the main star gets kidnapped towards the end of the movie and held for ransom to the studio. However, the main character is Eddie Mannix, one of the head honchos of the studio and he is primarily a ""fixer."" He is presented with one problem after the other and he fixes the problems. Then, he is presented with the kidnapping. The kidnapping, by the way, was carried out by Hollywood Communists, who are presented as a pack of intellectual buffoons spouting Marxist jargon. Mannix at the same time is being sought after to quit his job and go work for Lockheed, but he cannot make up his mind. At one point, one of the Hollywood Communists gets picked up by a Soviet sub and is presumably taken to the Iron Curtain (in actual life, one of the Hollywood 10 Communists did disappear and surfaced in East Germany). There are a lot of in-jokes regarding Hollywood of the '50s, some of which went over my head.",1484006400,,1321,4.413934426229508
7622927,5,B01B8836R6,An awesome extension of the Coen brs creative work in various genres of film. This is a satirical look at Hollywood as commie witch hunts began to intrude into American life. Spinning a tail which incorporates a variety of skits each being of a different film type. All held together by a story of intrigue and kidnapping. A knowledge filmdom in the era circa 1949- 52 makes the comedy both more intense and  varied ( you won't miss gags).,1483920000,,439,4.556962025316456
7622928,2,B01B8836R6,"Hail, Caesar! promises a lot with the pedigree of its cast and creators but in the end leaves much to be desired. Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Fiennes are enjoyable to watch, but with the ensemble cast they only get a half dozen scenes to shine. George Clooney isn't given much to work with or do, and the relatively new faces such as Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson and Jonah Hill seem like they were cast to attract younger crowds unfamiliar with the Coens' work. Rarely does this movie evoke comedy and it doesn't come close to the Coen Brothers' better comedies such as The Big Lebowski, The Hudsucker Proxy or O Brother, Where Art Thou?

7622930,4,B01B8836R6,"I sincerely enjoyed ""Hail, Caresar!""; however, that's not why I'm posting comments. I am amazed and confounded by the number of negative reviews for this film. You really have to hate something to write a scathing criticism, but that doesn't appear to be the case here. Reading through the many 1 star reviews, they're mostly lazy, one-line condemnations with no supportive analysis. The attacks come from a combination of: (1) disappointed fans of the Coen brothers; (2) those favoring broader comedies; and (3) viewers with decidedly questionable intellects.

I like the work of the Coen brothers, but I'm not an obsessed devotee. It is not my intention to defend the film so much as it is to understand the overwhelming dislike expressed on this site. It almost seems as if an organized effort was initiated to encourage bad reviews (campaigns of that nature are common on Amazon, sometimes as legitimate advocacy, but more so as a smear tactic). Granted, this is not a comedy that appeals to a wide audience, but is it so bad that hundreds of people were motivated to post 1 star reviews with little explanation?

It's rather disappointing to see contempt for a clever cinematic creation like ""Hail Caesar!"", while Amazon's current #1 Best Seller in Comedy is ""Bad Moms"" - predictable and formulaic fodder for the masses. Alas, humanity is hopeless.",1483833600,,1353,4.982300884955753

7622933,4,B01B8836R6,"Whether you love them or hate them, you have to admit that The Coen Brothers are perhaps the only auteur directors still working who on a consistent basis make movies that are keeping film culture alive in a time when television certainly reigns supreme. Few directors have a body of work similar to The Coens where hardcore cinefiles and movie critics are eager and energetic in giving their opinion on their latest work.
Hail, Caesar! is a love letter from The Coen Brothers to a certain time period in Hollywood that is now long gone. It is also yet another of what The Coens do best, an outside the box crime story.

Like any other film from The Coen Brothers, this is certainly worth your time and developing your own opinion. Personally, Im happy that The Coen Brothers have been able to achieve such mainstream success while never losing the originality in their voices so we can watch name actors who are usually offered dull and safe multi-million dollar roles playing something that is somewhat weird and outside of the box while maintaining a high level of quality.

While being highly favorited on Rotten Tomatoes, Ive felt a smug unimpressed attitude from people who have seen Hail, Caesar! You know, that type of attitude similar to Uncle Jesse on Full House when he attended a fancy dinner party and was claiming that everything was terribly overrated because he wanted to come across as more of an intellect.

I find it weird that the group of unimpressed cinefiles or hipsters who will either love this film ten or twenty years from now or be preceded by a new group of cinefiles or hipsters who will praise this film continue to keep this ritual of a film going from meh to immortal cult classic alive.",1483660800,,1720,4.66996699669967

It was almost as though they felt they had to check various boxes: quirky script, check. Cameos by their usual stars, check. Odd plot twist, check. Homage to old Hollywood, check. It had the quirky things you expect from them, like the song and dance number with an Channing Tatum. But other cameos were squandered like Jonah Hill, who was given very little to do. Why even bother? Only the end and the interplay of the Communists with George Clooney was really worth my time and to me really made the movie without hitting viewers over the head with a hammer. Yet I never understood Josh Brolin's character's desire to stay with the studio unless he was a masochist. The most poignant part was Clooney's final scene but it seemed like a lot of only mildly interesting ancillary plot lines to get there that ultimately detracted from the film rather than adding to it. In the end it's a film I really would bother to see again, no matter how well crafted, acted, costumed, choreographed, costumed, and produced it was. I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but like a needlessly over-decorated Christmas tree, it would have been wiser to restrain things of needless and pointless extravagance.",1483401600,,1343,4.670886075949367

My wife tuned out pretty quickly; I found it intriguing but not very involving; the jokes are the kind that might make you say to yourself Thats cute or Thats kind of funny, rather than LOL Hail, Caesars comparable to Inside Llewyn Davis, IMHO, in that the main characters basically opaque and not very sympathetic, and practically everyone else is a cartoon or a grotesque of some kind.  The brothers trademark cold-eyed detachment isn't really working for them here, in other words.

Nevertheless, Josh Brolin gets full marks for his performance as Eddie Mannix, old-school Hollywood fixer and hands-on production exec. Eddies to-do list provides the Coens with a perfunctory plot:  a starlets caught posing for French postcards, the unmarried star of popular aquatic pictures inconveniently gets pregnant, the erratic lead in a Bible epic unexpectedly goes missing, the studio head insists on casting a singing cowboy in a foofy drawing-room comedy

Most of the film consists of skitlike set pieces tied together, as the Dude might say, by a couple of nutty disquisitions on philosophy and religion.
There are some hits here, some missesa cell of blacklisted writers explains Marxism to a susceptible movie star (George Clooney) (hit); Eddie consults a panel of squabbling clergymen to make sure the Bible epics visual depiction of the Godhead won't offend ticket buyers (miss).

I didn't get the sense that the Coens were seriously trying to engage with any of these Big Ideas, as they did so brilliantly in A Serious Man.  I wasn't sure what to make of Eddies obsessive Catholicism (Father, its been 27 hours since my last confession) or the dimwitted actors flirtation with Communism.  The takeaway seems to be that religion and politics are all very well, but when it comes down to it, you just have to go out there, hit your mark and say your lines.

Despite Hail, Caesars disappointing lack of intellectual heft or emotional impact, the Coens full-scale reconstructions of various extinct Hollywood genres are still pretty entertainingthe cowboy shoot-em-up and super-gay dance routine (No Dames!) must be the best of their kind since Blazing Saddles.  The cast is spectacular, of course; Clooney always seems right at home in a Coen bros. picture, and we expect Channing Tatum, who plays a Communist song-and-dance man, to display some serious chops; Alden Ehrenreichs ridin, ropin and shootin skills are no less impressive.

Long story short, this ones probably best suited to TCM addicts and boomers (like me) who grew up watching stuff like The Robe on TV and wondering, What were they thinking?!

I think, and this is just my opinion, that the Coen Brothers had a longer script with more character development but it was cut down in re-writes for running time. Also George Clooney doesn't know whether to play it straight or slapstick.
  It's not all mediocrity though. Josh Brolin plays his character perfectly. A man who is torn between personal morals and a job where morals are at best,, compromised. Also Roger Deakins' cinematography is beautiful. I wish I could work a camera like Mr. Deakins can.

The DVD quality is OK, but with such fine cinematography, I'm motivated to buy a new player for the Blu-ray disc which was included.  I was an extra (background actor) in the film and all the characters' wardrobe are original early 1950's vintage clothes.  Vague recollections of the time came flowing back once I was fully costumed, and after my mustache was pencil-thinned, and my hair was razored close, I looked like pictures of my grandfather from that era. My steel-toe rubber-healed and full leather shoes weighed twice what we men wear today.  My pants, shirt, tie, and coat were so substantial: thicker, heavier, even itchier, too!  It's the Coen Brothers' demand for authenticity that makes every one of their actors look and 'feel' the era down to their skin and infuses their work.

7623021,5,B01B8836R6,"I don't love every film the Coen Brothers have made. This one, I do.

The view of Hollywood: sparkling, clean, bright, sunny, big, orderly, sharply drawn and colorful. Compare this to any modern depiction of the studios today. I'm thinking of 'The Muse' and seeing Albert Brooks' character parking in the public lot, trudging up a hill and then being directed to the third floor where he will have a meeting with 'Spielberg,' not the director but the director's cousin (who hasn't seen Steven in years).

The actor's house where the communist cell meets (a house on a cliff in Malibu, a sly joke in itself) is off the beaten path. Compare this to the modern depiction of a star's house in a film today - usually gated, behind walls, and not splendidly situated with wide-open vistas of the ocean and no neighbors for miles.

Those good old days were different, for sure, according to the Coen Bros.

Those good old days did seem more innocent and sweet in many ways (not all, but many), something that this film captures in some small details (the nightclub scene, for example, and the two movie stars on a 'date').I love the nostalgic feel of this film.

A few years ago, I rented a film from the 50s on DVD and watched it with a friend who was much older than I am. It may have been 'A Star Is Born.' After the film, we watched some 'extras,' one of which was the premiere of the film. There, in front of the theater, paraded the stars. Dressed to the nines, lined up like guests on a receiving line, and I recall at least one star bringing a parent!  A mother dressed up and looking like she just stepped off the train from Minneapolis! Sigh. You're not going to see that again. This was no red carpet. There was no evidence of the stylist at work - as I recall, the 'stars' looked like excited kids going to prom, even though older and plagued by scandals that Photoplay shared with the world.

Nostalgia. People dressing up to go to the theater and watch a movie. I have watched 'Hail Caesar!' twice and probably will see it again when I want that nostalgia hit.

Loved the religious theme, too. Listening to the discussion about the Christ by the religious leaders (priest, rabbi, etc.) reminded me of a group of car salesmen quibbling about the horsepower of their respective vehicles. That was a hoot.",1477094400,2,2309,4.507177033492823

7623026,3,B01B8836R6,"Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer at Capitol Pictures in the 1950s. His job is to make sure operations run smoothly at the studio, mostly by fixing problems that come up. Like the singing cowboy who can't quite act in a sophisticated melodrama and is driving the director crazy; the swimming star who is pregnant and unmarried; the big star (George Clooney) who is kidnapped off the set of the studio's big Biblical epic. The epic's script has already gone through the theological wringer of a rabbi, an Orthodox priest, a Protestant minister, and a Catholic priest (which is a pretty funny scene). Eddie is a Catholic and struggles with his sins and with an offer from Lockheed for a better paying, fewer hours job.

Both the characters in the movie and the movie itself vacillate between earnestness and frivolity. It comes off as the film makers both admiring and poking fun at the Golden Age of Hollywood. The problem is they have too much admiration to have the sharp and biting satire I was expecting. The lighter tone would be okay if there was more comedy or the comedy was funnier. A lot of jokes have too much set up, leading viewers to guess the punch line long before it's actually delivered on screen.

I did like the theme of the importance and value of work. Eddie is considering the offer from Lockheed because the company does serious business and he can have more home life and deal with more rational people than the Hollywood set. But there is value in the work he does at the studio, it isn't completely frivolous. There's an extended subplot with a sort of Hollywood communist think tank (though they seem to have jumbled up Locke, Hegel, and Marx, with more emphasis on jumble than on philosophy) which also reflects on the value of work. But again, the film makers can't seem to decide whether to take it seriously or not and the sequence comes off as muddled filler that helps to tie up loose ends of the plot.

I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, there are plenty of entertaining bits. But the movie has a lot of potential that never gets actualized, so it winds up disappointing. If taken as pure fluff, it's a fine film. But is that really what they were going for?",1476662400,,2197,4.542929292929293

7623060,5,B01B8836R6,"This movie is as much about the 1950s--or the official 1950s--as about the movie industry of that time.

I grew up (?) in the 50s, and this is exactly how it seemed: clean, dazzling, superficial, optimistic, amazing, shallow--and fake.  Two things were conspicuously and constantly left out (and they are left out in the movie, though glanced at): poverty, and most important, sex.

As for poverty, nowhere in the movie is it mentioned, and even the slaves in the ""Hail, Caesar!"" Roman epic have to have dust and sweat sprinkled on them, fake ratty hair made of dust-bunnies, and the crucified ones are seen ordering breakfast from the takeout guy.  No one ever seems to work hard, or to need to.  The toilsome necessities of life--food, clothes, shiny bulging cars, highways, houses--all seem to rain effortlessly from the sky.

And as for sex, the second-closest we come is a VERY oblique reference in the ""Art Drama"" movie, when Hobie's girlfriend runs away in a taxi with another guy to be with him all weekend.  The first-closest we come is the WONDERFUL song-and-dance routine done by the sailors in a bar.  Channing Tatum bursts into an upbeat song about how from now on (during the voyage), they'd get to see everything, but dames!  After which the guys all start frolicking together in the best Broadway Gay Dance send-up ever.  This is the most hilarious scene in a movie full of them.

Many of the Coen brothers' usual crew are here--Clooney, Brolin, Swinton, McDormand--but some only get cameos.  Still, the cameos are perfect.

Brolin (Mannix in the film; the studio honcho) and Clooney (the General in the Roman Epic) are the main characters, and both are very fine.  But the surprise runaway is Alden Ehrenreich, who effortlessly steals the show.  The scene between him and Ralph Fiennes is priceless.  Hoby (Ehrenreich's character) is the perfect 50s icon: a regular joe who struggles hard to please authorities, but never loses his childlike sunny disposition and regards every challenge as an opportunity.  Tilda Swinton is also superb as TWO gossip columnists--Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons--bitter, to-the-death enemies, and of course twins.

The two sides of the 50s--childlikeness and childishness--are perfectly embodied in Brolin and Clooney's characters.  Mannix, the Brolin character, is inwardly angst-ridden, yet he mostly obsesses and feels horribly guilty over trifles (he goes to confession at least once a day about having sneaked a cigarette, after promising his wife he'd quit).  Despite all this, he maintains a surface veneer of worldly wisdom and a real flair for maneuvering primadonna personalities into accord.  At the end, he encounters an actual moral quandary--whether to stay with the studio or join Lockheed--and he makes the right choice.  (It's lovely to see the Lockheed head-hunter beam with joy over the H-Bomb, newly developed, and just another profitable toy in his arsenal.)  Clooney, on the other hand, is a shallow man who is suddenly given the chance to widen his horizons, and he nimbly jumps in the deep end, without a clue what harm it will do him personally.  And when the harm shows up, when Brolin, his boss, literally slaps him down, he just as nimbly jumps back.  Clooney's ""star-making"" monologue as the Roman general standing at the cross of Jesus, is superb--a completely convincing and moving change of heart--until it isn't.

Both characters are both childlike and childish--essentially hollow, yet marvelously attractive, and fake.

All in all a great send-up and a marvelous movie.",1474848000,,3555,5.094991364421416

You also need to have some understanding of and sympathy with Marxism, while being able to laugh at the absurdities it has spawned.

7623082,4,B01B8836R6,"""Hail, Caesar!"" is a lot of fun. There are so many story threads and hilarious characters that you can't help but enjoy this movie. When you learn that some of these events actually happened, it makes the film all the more funny.

This movie is everything you expect from the Cohen Brothers; smart script, great direction, and funny characters. The jokes are made stronger by the performance of the all-star cast. Josh Brolin's Mannix is a well realized fixer-character who really holds the movie together. I was worried at first that the film would ask too much of his character, but by the end, everything was executed brilliantly. New-to-me Alden Ehrenreich also holds his own as Hobie Doyle, and adds most of the charm you would normally get from Frances McDormand. Cohen regular George Clooney delivers a great character in Baird Whitlock, and is responsible for a large portion of the comedy in this film.

The time period is also a great setting for the film. There is a lot of reverence for post-war Hollywood, and a lot of respect for the 1950s. The setting is a perfect storm for Cohen commentary and satire. Especially the large Communist plot point that pays-off in spectacular fashion.

Overall, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is one of the more accessible films in the Cohen Brother filmography, and will go into their pantheon of greats.",1473638400,,1337,4.855263157894737

This could have been a pretty good movie.  The story line could have been developed into something interesting in several different ways.

7623138,5,B01B8836R6,"If you love the Coen Brothers movies you can appreciate the concept of the anti-hero. To start, I will say this film required a second viewing, I stopped short the first time having not grasped the intent of the narrative. Moments into the second viewing I got it, the anti-hero is Hollywood! After this realization, I enjoyed the film as much as any of the CB movies. Hail, Caesar looks and at times feels like so many movies it pays homage to, and it sounds like a CB movie should sound. In the past I have personally interpreted a certain negative bias towards Hollywood; mainly in Barton Fink and to a much lesser extant The Big L. I did not come away from Hail, Caesar with that same vibe at all.

Hail, Caesar provides the viewer with a comical inside peak into the Hollywood of old. The CB Hollywood is a world where dreams can come true but there's always a bottom line. This bottom line is inhabited by very real and might-I-add MULTI-talented actors, as well as hard working PEOPLE. The role of the unknown, unseen and unloved set worker gets thrown into the spotlight by the CB. As with every CB type there is the good (the film splicer who nearly chokes to death by her own scarf) and the ridiculous (the patsy who succumbs to the persuasive communist/writers guild alliance). There are more then enough amazing actors to list, if I singled out one it would be Josh Brolin. I can't complain about duration of screen time, as I do see Hollywood as the character and EVERYBODY does an amazing job with whatever scenes/lines they are given. Any fan of John Turturro as the Jesus understands, it's not what you're given, it's what you make out of it that matters to the audience.

Not to drag on and on about the intricacies of the plot (as anyone could with a CB movie) but watching how much effort went into the making of this film, and trying to capture how much hard work went into the films of yestermillenium is highly entertaining. I'm not a fan of movies that seem to profit off nostalgia but this movie serves more as a reminder. Yet this reminder of Hollywood is also a reminder of ourselves as humans, our passions, our weaknesses, our efforts to be something greater.  It is the grandiose throwback scenes that drive home the point for me, when so many of our current movies seem to rely more on talented editing programs as opposed to actors, or make up artists, or set designers, or special effects that are hand crafted. THIS is a love letter to Hollywood from the CB, that any young movie lovers should watch. I hope other fans like myself get the urge to watch some classic movies after viewing this. There is a pantheon of film that can capture imaginations in a way that current movies are not designed to.",1472428800,,2733,4.494969818913481

7623151,2,B01B8836R6,"I could not help getting the feeling after watching this latest from the marvelously talented Coen Brothers that a few scenes were missing.  Not only does the center not hold, there's no center to be held.  What the point of the film within the film is we fail to learn - one guesses it is a sendup of those Cecil B De Mille films of the long gone 50s.  If so, the parody becomes self-parody, because while those bigger than life films have not withstood the test of time, they at least had a sense of purpose to them.  This film doesn't.  Channing Tatum is superb in his dance routine but once the routine is done the film fizzles as we are left wanting more of that scene's exuberance and we get instead lame comedy or attempts at comedy.
  The plot is nothing but a series of skits, some successful, most not.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for Clooney.  If he'd stared at the camera and confessed ""I don't know what made me decide to be in this picture"" I wouldn't have been surprised.
  Some reviewers have rightly applauded the film's grand recreation of the 50s atmosphere.  Yet a film needs more than that to hang its coat (or toga) on.  For example, what is the Johansson character doing in this film?  Only her hairdresser knows for sure.  The entire kidnapping plot (or subplot) falls flat.  Are these the same guys who brought us the delightfully off kilter, ingenious ""The Big Lebowski""?  Hard to believe.  But if one takes a long look at their list of films one can't help but notice that they've had their share of duds in between the shimmering lights and shadows of ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" ""Raising Arizona,"" the under appreciated ""Miller's Crossing,"" the cockeyed assurance that informs ""True Grit"" and the fire and verve of ""No Country"" are all absent here.  So is any hint of inspiration.
  Understand that I am a devotee of the Coen Brothers; pound for pound perhaps our most creative, imaginative, daring filmmakers (combining the best of directorial and writing abilities).  This is perhaps why this film is such a dismal disappointment.  Better luck next time Joel and Ethan.",1472169600,,2101,4.634146341463414

A kidnapping, a pregnant unwed leading actress, an actor who may be outed for a sexual indiscretion, twin gossip columnists who hate each other and a communist conspiracy.  This is supposed to be a comedy but speaking for myself I counted maybe one mild chuckle.  Clooney appears for little more than 10 minutes and is hogtied by the dialogue and the script; while Brolin is very good but he has nothing to work with.

7623226,2,B01B8836R6,"I admire virtually everything the Coens have written/directed/produced; heck, if I was pressed to come up with a top 20 list of my favorite films, their works would probably constitute 15-20% of it - to put it mildly, I appreciate their work.  To this day, I can't take a trip by car of more than an hour without using the 'total silence' conversation piece from Fargo, and I have to suppress (read: FIGHT) the urge at work when discussing particulars of a job to not burst into 'Oh we can't do that dude, that f&*#$ with our plan'.

On to Hail, Caesar!, the latest offering from the ridiculously talented pair.  I was stoked to see this!  The whole 3 kids thing puts a damper on catching most theatrical releases, but I made time for this one, and not just for the screenplay and direction.  I enjoy the recent work of nearly everyone in this cast, especially Johannsen and Hill of late.  I also felt that Brolin, while being dead serious throughout, had his share of nice deadpan moments.  Unfortunately, that's about the extent of my enjoyment - a few scattered moments.  There was gorgeous detail here; the production design rendered one of the most faithful reproductions of the era I've ever seen (getting harder and harder to pull off as the decades pass; bless you, vintage car enthusiasts!) and I get the whole biblical Father-Son symbolism of the studio owner and Manix; I even agree with what other reviewers mentioned that Channing Tatum is cast as, and about the closest modern equivalent we have in terms of star power to Fred Astaire.  It's just that...it all comes across as incomplete and disjointed.  The film introduces so many characters (some of which don't get their introduction until 2/3 of the way through) that the 106 minute runtime feels like a shortchanging, especially in terms of character development.  This is the most double-edged of swords, though, as I would have surely nodded off had this material and story been fleshed out to 140 minutes or more.  For all the millions spent creating this world, the unuse of its star power is unacceptable.

If you want to make a love letter to the Hollywood of yesteryear, fine, do it, but please engineer it to be more than just A few tongue-in-check setpieces that aren't all that engrossing in their own right.  Things like the dance number with Tatum, or the synchronized swimming/mermaid piece are created with a dedication to their respective sources, but if you're not someone who seeks out vintage memorabilia and period history as a personal compulsion, the ability of this film to hold your attention will get planed thin after about 40 minutes.  By then, though, you've invested enough time in it that you don't want to cave and admit your boredom, especially because, unlike in the period it depicts, tickets to this stuff are not cheap.  Streaming would be a better option, but even then I'd wait until the price drops below 3 bucks.

One film is not sufficient evidence for me to claim that the Coens have lost anything, and this movie is not a complete waste.  But, I cannot help but feel disappointed.  I was looking for something memorable, something that make me want to revisit this material.  What I watched was no doubt something plausible, but not very rewarding.  3.5 out of 10 for the visuals; just wish there was more creativity propping them up.",1470614400,,3346,4.744386873920552

7623230,4,B01B8836R6,"It would be hard to top Richard Brody's excellent review in ""The New Yorker,"" although I would point out that dense symbolism is fuel for analysis, but does not a great film make.  It may be going too far to say that the unseen studio head in New York is the God of the Old Testament, while Eddie Mannix, the man on the ground holding things together, is Jesus Christ, taking the sins of the people onto himself.  We are confronted throughout with delightful characters that are fully fleshed-out despite each one's minimal screen time, and the Hollywood studio milieu of the time with its soundstages and complete control over the actors' lives.  There's an acrobatic Western, a highbrow drawing-room drama, and a full-length song-and-dance number that celebrates sheer exuberance and unspoken homoeroticism.

The ""plot,"" such as it is, involving a major star kidnapped by Communists, is such a small part of the whole that it would be an exaggeration to even call it the center of the film - it's more an excuse for the Coens to display one of their favorite aspects of human nature, clueless stupidity in all its forms.  The film's subject is the Hollywood of the early 1950s, and the religious aspect of the film-within-a-film of the title is there as the biggest story  possible - a cast-of-thousands spectacle, set in the Roman Empire in the time of Jesus.  It just doesn't get any bigger than that, and the squabbling of the clergymen brought in to give their approval to the film's portrayal of Jesus shows how the story is often nothing more than a reflection of our own egos.

Masterfully executed and great fun, ""Hail Caesar!"" is unfortunately too frenetic and unfocused to take its place among the Coen Brothers' best work.",1470528000,,1735,4.798657718120805

Then along came ""Hail, Caesar!""  a star-studded ""satire"" of 1950s Hollywood filled with misfired in-jokes and unrelenting tedium. In other words, ""The Big Lebowski"" without the laughs. Stunning period detail fails to camouflage a shockingly weak Coen script. Josh Brolin's inspired performance as studio fixer Eddie Mannix deserves a much better film.

The milliner [one of Swineton's hats]  should be shot - all crinkly and ill-fitting - same applies to one of her gowns .... bad, badly fitted .. or rather lack of fitting ...

Clooney [showing his age] :  reminds strongly of Jack Hawkins in ""Ben Hur"" ~ nice 'turn' by Fiennes .... but also somewhat wasted.

Set in and around a movie studio, the scenes of movies within the movie are given loving attention with real talent on exhibit.

George Clooney truly inhabits the character you see in the trailer, and his character is only the tip of the iceberg.

7623263,4,B01B8836R6,"I began watching this movie thinking it was going to be a comedy. Afterward, I wasn't certain what genre it should be classified. There's drama, comedy, melodrama...I guess overall it's a drama, based on the wheelings and dealings of Eddie Mannix, film studio executive and producer, and ""fixer"" to the stars for MGM.  It gives an interesting if brief per scene look into the behind-the-scenes end of moving pictures and the things Mannix goes through to keep his studios contractees out of scandal and scandal sheets.

The movie filming scenes are probably the best part of the show, especially the musical numbers. The plot of the Hollywood star kidnapped by communist screenwriters and converted to their cause could've been played for more laughs. Each of the subplots could've been a movie in itself with a little effort but there are too many recognizable stars and too little time to go into depth for each character so it becomes more like extended cameos, which is a pity,.

I really would've liked to have seen how the cowboy star fared in the completion of the drawing room comedy in which he found himself abruptly cast. I also thought his insight into the kidnapping might've put him more into that storyline, but no go.  Actually every problem coming up seemed to be handled a little too easily, hence negating any drama. The irony of the defecting musical comedy star losing the ransom money because he chose to save his dog instead wasn't wasted and served to show the futility of their scheme while pointing up that it really wasn't about the money after all. The so-called inner turmoil Mannix faced about changing jobs juxtaposed against the backdrop of the religious drama his kidnappee is starring in didn't really work.

All in all, it's an entertaining movie with good acting by all and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I simply wish I didn't have this nagging doubt about exactly what kind of movie I had watched. I guess the best description would be ""quirky episodic drama.""

This movie was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1469750400,,2091,4.81058495821727
7623264,3,B01B8836R6,"Terrible marketing led audiences to believe that this would be one of the Coens' goofier comedies a la Burn After Reading. Actually, the tone has more in common with that of The Man Who Wasn't There, their underrated postwar noir. The humor is dry and the film is driven more by ideas than by story.

Hail Caesar is the Coen Brothers neither at their best nor their worst.  There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments throughout (""would that it 'twer so simple""), and the tributes to Old Hollywood are delightful. George Clooney's storyline is gloriously absurd; it felt like the Coens were satirizing the right's tendency to portray Clooney as a dangerous Hollywood commie. I wanted much more of it, personally.

7623339,2,B01B8836R6,"The Coen Brothers are awesome filmmakers, but this most recent work, Hail Caesar, is not one of their best works. It is, in a word, a dud.

This movie ostensibly covers the career of Eddie Mannix, the ultimate, legendary, Hollywood fixer. The events portrayed therein bear little, if any, relation to Mannixs many-storied life. Rather, far from being a piece of fiction, this movie is pure fantasy, one based on Mannixs life in name only.

The only highlight of Hail, Caesar bears no relation to Mannixs life. One highlight deals with Mannix/Josh Brolin calling upon the church leaders of the Jewish and major Christian denominations to discuss the merits of his motion picture on the life of Jesus. In the space of ten minutes the brothers were able to summarize the competing all the main viewpoints of the nature of God. Another highlight contains a shorter, but equally succinct, summary of the Marxist theory of the historical dialectic, given by members of a coven of Marxist Hollywood screenwriters who have kidnaped the George Clooney character, a bizarre and preposterous subplot in the movie.

This is all well and fine for a theological class or one on political theory, but these momentary diversions do nothing to elevate the entertainment value of this movie, which is frankly all flash and no substance.

Yet, this film is great as a period piece. It is obvious that the brothers have given pains-taking time and care into creating the atmosphere and surroundings depicting Post-WWII, pre-television Los Angeles. Their obsessive attention to detail, unfortunately, has sucked all the life from the characters and the plot, such as they were.",1468886400,,1656,5.054945054945055

The Coen Brothers bring their love for the Golden Age of Hollywood to the screen once again with this multi-story caper film that amuses, wows in grandeur, but falls on a whole. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a studio fixer for Capitol Pictures. He interferes with the lives of the Hollywood elite, solving their studio and personal issues. Stars back in the day were almost property of the studio system. Mannix must deal with the kidnapping of famed star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), the bastard child of DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), setting up western star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) with a woman, and the rantings of Hollywood director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Rounding out the star-studded cast is Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, and Jonah Hill. While some of the stories eventually cross, there isn't a coherent plot for the audience to latch onto, which is ultimately why the movie falls flat. The critics praised it, but mainly because it was set in the changing age of cinema, when TV was on the verge of become popular. The extensive period detail and awesomely choreographed scenes (most notably Scarletts swimming montage, Tatums sailor dance scene, and Ehrenreichs western shoot-out) played homage to the Hollywood system of the era. The movie was laugh-out-loud at times, with some great comedy to rival the Coens other movies, but as whole it doesnt weigh up to the other Coen greats. Like Burn After Reading (2008) the concept is there but wasn't executed to the extent that it could be. Its definitely worth checking out for Coen fans, but take it with a grain of salt. You may be yarning between the fun moments, wondering why you're watching this movie and not watching Raising Arizona (1987), Millers Crossing (1990), Fargo (1996), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou?

The simple review is that this is an elaborate take on beliefs from the sacred to the profane.  From God to Money.  I like the premise and the look.  Old Hollywood is fun just ask Woody Allen.

7623460,4,B01B8836R6,"Not a normal comedy, not at least how many in North America would define comedy. It's a spoof, a lampoon of Hollywood's Golden Age. This was the era in which the large studios controlled everything. They had the producers, directors and actors all under contract, and they also owned nearly all the theaters in large chains. This iron grip on the industry started to be broken in 1948 with the landmark SCOTUS anti-trust decision that forced the studios to divest themselves of their theater chain ownerships. This, coupled with the rise of TV from then into the early 1950's, caused a significant slump in theater ticket sales that lasted until Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" in 1972 and Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" in 1974. The rise of free agent actors not under iron-clad studio contract, with independent directors and producers did not rise until the latter 1950's.

Hollywood responded during the mid-1950's while they still had contractual control over producers, directors and actors, by creating epic spectacles and innovating with wide-screen formats that could not be done on TV. That's the environment in which we enter the Coen Bro's film, ""Hail, Caeser!"", this interim period in which Hollywood was trying to find itself after losing the theater chains and competing with television. Like Francois Truffaut's 1973 ""Day for Night"" which portrays the trials and tribulations of a director attempting to create a movie, the Coen Bro's move up the food chain in the remnants of the studio system to the head of film production for a fictitious major Hollywood studio, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). He's a ""fix-it"" man that keeps production going by removing the barriers and obstacles impeding the producers and directors working for him. This includes finding ways to sooth the ruffled feathers of prima dona actors, keep scandals out of the tabloids and gossip columns, solve personality conflicts, and find solutions to casting problems. The Coen Bro's do a superb job with production values and costuming to provide the early 1950's setting in great detail, including some pull-back screen shots of the countless large sound stages and back lots with enormous structures that populated the acreage occupied by the major studios. Even the color saturation goes for the kind of look Technicolor created in that era.

The result is film that pans and skewers what Hollywood was during the 1950's, and their epic productions. The film's title comes from the fictitious studio's major production nearing the end of filming, the fictitious ""Hail, Caesar!"" Those familiar with Biblical Roman Empire epics from that era will see it as a blend of Ben-Hur, The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, and King of Kings. Likewise there is a synchronized swimming movie in production, an obvious nod to the late 1940's and early 1950's ""aquamusicals"" with Olympic synchronized swimming star Esther Williams. Lest the classic dance musicals get left out, there's one of those with ballroom dancing and another musical patterned after the film adaptations of the large production Broadway stage musicals. The film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific from the late 1950's comes to mind immediately. Lest it be left out, there are clear nods in a couple directions to the Senator Joe McCarthy Hollywood Commie Witch-Hunt and Blacklisting that centered on many writers (it also ensnared producers and actors). The icing on the cake is getting to see how the screen personas carefully groomed by the studios for public consumption do not necessarily match real life actor personalities (more on this would create spoilers). This is counterbalanced by the twin gossip columnists who are unquestionably patterned after Hedda Hopper and pig sty of actor and studio scandals she could revel in with her syndicated newspaper column.

The fictitious movie productions depicted were the large scale film spectacles with production values/designs and shooting schedules TV could not hope to compete with or produce. Hollywood was desperately looking for cinema that could differentiate itself on the big screen from the living room small screen in a manner that would draw people back into the movie theaters. The risk, though, was one major epic film flop could ruin a film studio financially. It was a pressure cooker environment, and that's the world in which Eddie Mannix worked.

Don't expect situations or jokes that will elicit knee-slapping guffaws. The humor is very wry and very dry. It's in all the convoluted contortions Eddie Mannix must go through to keep the studio's film productions from derailing and coming to a grinding halt and bleeding at a rate of untold dollars per day. Having seen Francois Truffaut's 1973 film, ""Day for Night"" a number years ago, I immediately ""got it"" with where the Coen Bro's were going with this movie. The real humor is a behind the scenes look on the last years of the Hollywood Golden Age studio system with all its warts and feet of clay the studios tried very hard to conceal from the general public using smoke and mirrors with sleight of hand, a romantic image that nostalgically persists to this day.

Not the best of the Coen Bro's work, but not the worst either, which sill makes it an excellent film. Four solid stars for a job extremely well done.",1467936000,22,5313,5.081328751431844

Most everyone else was under-served due to their screen time, but all delivered on their quirky characters.

They spent a lot reproducing an authentic 50s-ish look and hired some very talented actors. So what went wrong?  How did it turn into a 106 minute snooze fest?  First of all it isn't about anything in particular.  Although the focus is on Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix a studio fixer it hops around through an Ester Williams-ish aqua number, a clunky send up of South Pacific, a swipe at B-picture Westerns, studio arranged romances, pinko script writers, gossip columnists and the sort-of kidnapping of George Clooney's character. Then there is the Western star (played nicely by Alden Ehrenreich) who seems to be channeling Forest Gump.  Frances MacDormand has a three minute role as a chain-smoking film editor (she gets her scarf caught in the Moviola), and Jonah Hill appears for roughly 90 seconds.  Maybe the problem is encapsulated by John Bluthal who appears as a Maxist professor.  He provides a fairly realistic portrayal of a Maxist professor - well done but not funny.  The Cohen Brothers have been quoted as saying that it isn't intended as a comedy.  Well, at least that much is accurate.",1467676800,,1275,4.838709677419355

He is a glue guy and makes it all work handles all the problems and keeps the engine running (think Tina Fey in 30Rock). He is always a little stressed, a little frazzled but never quite loses it or feels like he has lost control. I guess it, ironically, reminds me a little of real life.

It is wrought with so many magical things, I already want to see it again!

I feel bad about the bad reviews from consumers that it has occasionally received. Rotten Tomatoes has it at an 84%, which is a great score. Most critics truly enjoyed the film. Maybe what critics say doesn't matter to you. That's great, I respect that. Please allow me, a film lover and regular Joe, to tell you what I think of the movie.

I feel one has to understand the history of both film and America's history of the time period to fully appreciate this film. Those with negative feelings towards this movie perhaps aren't fully aware of the time period it is representing. This movie impeccably, magnificently paints that time period. And, it does so in such a fun way, with such wonderful character brought to life by some fantastic actors.

I talked to some people who saw the movie once and didn't really appreciate it, but then saw it again and truly loved it. I have found that filmmakers such as the Coens make movies that demand at the very least a second viewing. They are super thoughtful filmmakers who don't make typical movies, and I have found personally that there isn't a Coen film I haven't appreciated more with multiple viewings. You pick up on things, you appreciate things, you see the subtle humor and the subtle messages.

This movie is funny, even with my first viewing I laughed out loud a lot, but beyond that, it has some truly poignant themes that resonated with me personally. Themes of how to balance work and family, and what truly matters when it comes to a career - money, or a personal satisfaction in your work?

Really great stuff! This movie is great. Give it a shot! And, if you already have given it a shot, give it another. It is a film that deserves more appreciation that it is getting. It really is quite brilliant.",1466553600,,2096,4.417098445595855

If you are a film fanatic (especially in regards to the Golden Era of Hollywood, the 30s thru the mid-50s) than you will most likely enjoy it and ""get"" it. For it is filled with little ""inside"" jokes that only s few will get.  Example: Hobie's date for the premiere of his movie (set up by the studio of course!) is named, ""Carlotta Valdez"".  This also happens to be the name of a character who is never seen on screen and may have possible been a suicide in Hitchcock;s ""Vertigo"".  I caught it right away but I don't think the majority of viewers would get it.  So, this film is like oysters on the half shell - not to everyone's taste but those who have the taste for them, LOVE them.

I was especially disappointed given the cast.  Poorly written with unconnected scenes and some bizarre tie in to Communism. Scenes were incredibly long with ponderous dialog, no action and a real mediocre performance by Josh Brolin.  I love quirky movies, but this was beyond quirky. What's worse is that we had friends over after dinner to watch it and had to apologize for such a horrible flick.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I will just say the story was weak, and the topic deserved better.  If you want to see a really good ""behind the scenes"" movie, try Bullets Over Broadway, which is of course about the theater and has far less to work with than Hail, Caesar,  but is a much more entertaining movie.  3 stars is all I can give this one, and I really wanted to like it.",1466121600,2,708,4.161764705882353

It's very inside baseball, and you need to also be nostalgic for old Hollywood to appreciate it. However, I think even insiders miss what this movie is about. To me, the credo has to do with whether or not art is a valid career, if you're trying to live a good life. The last scene of the movie is what the movie is about. Is it okay to do this job? It's hard, it's a mess, the hours are horrible, your family has to pay the price for it, etc. Is it okay to do it anyway, just because you love it? The Coen Brothers apparently needed to make a movie that asked those questions. I needed to see a movie that answered them.

7623837,3,B01B8836R6,"An All-Star Cast and the movie has several humorous moments, but much of it feels forced and the movie drags in places.

Josh Brolin is a Media Mogul-type who has been offered a ""non-Hollywood"" job that promises no further Hollywood Hijinks.  George Clooney plays a Hollywood Star who is kid-napped and held for ransom by Communists.  Ralph Fiennes plays a flamboyant British director who tries to give a Hollywood Cowboly played by Aiden Ehrenreich, a new image.  Scarlett Johansen plays as a swimming starlet whose poor relationship leaves her in a scandalous situation.  Coen Brother's Alumni Frances McDormand has a wonderful bit part as a film editor.

With all of this talent, where does the movie go wrong.  If it had played as more of a dark comedy or drama, it might have been funnier.  What is left is alot of Hollywood Kitsch that Film Critics will say is brilliant and thought-provoking, but comes across as people trying very hard to be funny and failing.

There were parts in the second act that drug on way too long to the point I almost lost interest.  You do get some great performances and an otherwise interesting story, but I don't feel it would have been worth a theater watch and maybe even a wait til it was on cable.

7623877,4,B01B8836R6,"The words above come from George Clooneys character Baird Whitlock (as Caesar) as he finally stands at the foot of the movie lot cross and attempts to deliver a message that gives the movie meaning. But the movie really doesnt have meaning  it is pure entertainment, compliments of the Coen Brothers. And that is why the pseudo-serious phrase is funny.

To keep the scenario short, Hail Caesar! follows a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Pictures in the 1950s, who cleans up and solves problems for big names and stars in the industry. But when studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears, Mannix has to deal with more than just the fix. Add to this the stereotype films of the 40s and 50s  romances in elegant settings, Bible epics, Esther Williams underwater ballets, Hopalong Cassidy (and all Western) movies, Gene Kelley type dance movies - and movie lots with all manner of shenanigans  (star turns, temperamental stars, cowboys who become romance boys because they are needed, intrigue, influence of the Communist party aka blacklist, etc) and you get an idea of the fun of the spoof.

The major star turn here is Josh Brolin who manages a role that is equal parts tough and likeable and funny. He is aided by such stars as George Clooney (of course), Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, and the team of Future Men (the communist circle who are out to destroy capitalism  with a little help from the inside).

The film is Coen Brothers fun, not to be taken too seriously but appreciated for its parody of the Holly wood of the 40s and 50s. Kick back and just laugh. Grady Harp, June 16",1465776000,2,1725,4.787878787878788

7623889,4,B01B8836R6,"A really fun movie but not at all the film that was advertised.  This is not a George Clooney movie, it is a Josh Brolin movie.  The trailer would you have believe this is the story of an A-List Hollywood actor getting kidnapped and the entire stable of stars at the studio looking for him.  It is in fact the story of a man who manages and handles the day-to-day operations of a golden age film studio who has a crisis of faith in what he does for a living. Should he abandon the lunacy of Hollywood for a lucrative yet normal 9-to-5 job in the burgeoning and important aerospace industry or stay at the studio with the constant yet frivolous crises he is besieged with daily?  The kidnapping of George Clooney's character is but one of many crises Josh Brolin faces while trying to make his decision.  The title refers to the prestige picture the studio is currently making, and George Clooney is the star of, about a Roman solider who experiences a similar crisis of faith.  Many of the actors advertised as ""starring"" in this film have mere cameos with no more than two lines, though are nonetheless still entertaining.  So, while not the rollicking, whacky romp through Golden Age Hollywood depicted in the trailer, it is still an amusing and wonderful homage to the several styles of big films made back in the day.  Channing Tatum's increasingly homoerotic, Gene Kelly-inspired tap dance number ""No Dames"" is worth the price of admission alone.",1465689600,,1451,4.662745098039216

Direction is crisp, script is fairly witty, and the ensemble cast is impeccable.  What's lacking is the pizazz that made such Coen offerings as ""Millers Crossing"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" to name just a few so transcendent.  For nothing see the film because it is a terrific homage to Red Scare Hollywood.  The film is also an excellent showcase for the talents of Alden Ehrenreich who plays the genial singing cowboy, Hobie Doyle.  Ehrenreich fully exploits the opportunities given him particularly one where he has an exchange about line readings with a veddy British director played by Ralph Fiennes.  With his work here you can see how Ehrenreich is being considered for the role of Han Solo in the upcoming stand alone""Star Wars"" film.

I enjoy even second and third tier Coen Brothers films. Despite tepid to outright hostile reviews of ""Hail Caesar"" I found it to be one of Joel and Ethan Coen's very best films. However, I used to live in Hollywood, used to be in the film business and, like the Coens, I have a fondness for the history, lore and myth of old pre-TV Hollywood and the Hollywood studio system. Your enjoyment of ""Hail Caesar"" will likely depend on if you can answer ""yes"" to knowing who and what the following people, events and subjects are (it's hard to appreciate an irony or joke about, caricature of, loving recreation of or quote about someone or something if you don't know what it's about):

Joe McCarthy
The House On Un American Activities Committee
The Hollywood Blacklist
Hedda Hopper
Luella Parsons
The Carmen Sternwood ""Chinese dress"" scene from ""The Big Sleep""
Irving Thalberg
Gene Autry
Esther Williams
Gene Kelly
Carmen Miranda
Eddie Mannix
Hollywood Biblical Epics since the silent era
Carlotta Valdes

If you can say ""yes"" to most of the above then you will likely find the film to be delightful. If not then the actual situations, and what the story can tell you about the people, and why they are doing and saying what what are doing and saying, may leave you blank and trying to figure out why the film seems flat. It isn't. It's brilliant. But you do have to know what you're looking at. For some people ""Hail Caesar"" may be as interesting as ""Straight Outta Compton"" is to a Trump supporter. For those who know Hollywood it's a charming, lovingly made reenactment of an era, its style, personalities, film cliches, story genres and production modes as seen through the imagination of Joel and Ethan Coen.

I suspect that one reason that the film may have not caught fire with some people is that it lampoons the Marxist/Communist members of the 1950s era film community who were the targets of the McCarthy era anti-Communist HUAC hearings and the Hollywood blacklist. These people have since the 1950s become the founding saints and martyrs of modern liberal Hollywood. Hollywood has, as an institution, been out for cultural and political revenge on conservative America ever since the HUAC era.

Unlike the recent film ""Trumbo"", where blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo is portrayed as a flawed but heroic genius screenwriter in tune with modern progressivism, the Communist screenwriters in ""Hail Caesar"" are portrayed as verbose faux intellectual nincompoops. If Trumbo had appeared in ""Hail Caesar"" he would have been one of the fools in the row boat, rowing out from a luxurious Malibu beach house to rendezvous with a Russian submarine. The fools in the row boat are of course the subversive writer's group ""The Future"" that kidnapped George Clooney's character. Not a proper way, some might feel, to treat saints and martyrs. In the film the fools elect to stay behind in Hollywood to carry on the struggle of inserting subversive commie propaganda into seemingly innocuous entertainment. In real life they were more successful than they could ever have dreamed of. So the joke may be on us.

The Coen's view on the era is both satirical and subtly at odds with progressive dogma about what is always virtuous now, always wrong in the past and Hollywood's mythologizing of the post world war two oppression of its Marxist and Communist film makers. ""Hail Caesar"" was obviously a labor of love for the Coens. It deserved much better than it received on release. But it's not surprising many people just didn't get it. Still, I would rank it in the top ten of all time Joel and Ethan Coen films. RECOMMENDED.",1465344000,19,3790,4.7978560490045945

7623961,4,B01B8836R6,"Hail, Caesar! takes place in a bygone era partly based in reality, party based in the vivid imaginations of Joel and Ethan Coen. Set in 1950s Hollywood, the film takes us on a colorful tour of the fictional Capitol Studios. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer for the company, an executive whose job involves covering up the transgressions of its stars, fending off gossip columnists, putting a positive spin on stories before the term spin existed, and making sure the movies are turned out on budget and with a minimum of hiccups.

We see several movies in production. One of them is a Biblical epic called Hail, Caesar!, A Tale of the Christ, starring the studios most valuable leading man, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). An amalgam of Ben-Hur, The Robe, and Quo Vadis, Hail, Caesar! is the studios most expensive production of the year and a hoped-for huge moneymaker.

Another in the studios stable, the Esther Williams-inspired star of synchronized water ballet musicals DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), is pregnant but not married. This would be taboo for any woman of the era, and certainly won't do for DeeAnnas girl-next-door image.

Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) is the studios singing cowboy hero, known for trick riding, roping varmints, square shooting, and a gentle way with a tune. A drawing room drama is underway, and the studio head demands that the director, Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), cast Doyle as the romantic lead. Though the match-up is akin to Oliver Hardy starring in Hamlet, Laurentz must forge ahead, his patience dwindling with every twang emanating from Hobies mouth.

On yet another stage, an elaborate musical number starring song-and-dance man Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) is being shot for a movie titled No Dames. The number, in which sailors bemoan the fact that they're headed out to sea with no females in the picture for months, is a highlight of the film. Tatum dances up a storm, combining athletics, soft shoe, and tap. With the innocent, enthusiastic look of a young Gene Kelly, he leads a growing chorus of sailors in a routine that soon comes to look like a celebration of gay liberation.

Tossed into this swirling mix is a kidnapping plot that gives Clooney some wonderful opportunities to create comic reactions and skewer his own superstar image.

Tilda Swinton plays the dual role of twin sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker, complete with assertive, Hedda Hopper-style hats.  Frances McDormand is a film editor working in a small, darkened room to shape the final cut of the studios pictures while chain-smoking and not being terribly careful about a lengthy scarf. Jonah Hill, in a very brief role, portrays the studios go to guy who can furnish important documents and rectify sticky situations quickly.

One of the best-written scenes is a meeting between Mannix and several clergymen. Mannix wants to elicit the opinion of religious leaders about how Christ is portrayed in Hail, Caesar! The discussion leads to an over-sharing of their personal agendas as Mannix patiently listens and attempts to keep the meeting on track.

Brolins Mannix is the central character, and is essentially the grown-up among pampered, highly-paid performers. Hes on call night and day and is expected to keep embarrassing information about Capitols stars out of the papers. Unlike many of the people he has to protect, Mannix is a family man who feels guilty about having to spend so much time away from his wife and kids. He is contemplating a job offer that will require a lot less stress and better hours.

There was an actual Eddie Mannix who was an executive at M-G-M during its heyday. Like the fictional Mannix of the film, he was a fixer, paid to cover up details of the stars private lives to maintain their public image.

There is a lot to admire in Hail, Caesar! and movie fans, in particular, will enjoy the references and satirical pokes at establishment movie making in the studio era. The kidnapping subplot, however, never gathers adequate steam, and a communist conspiracy story thread seems out of place and perhaps one too many elements to satirize.

Rated PG-13, the movie is the darker side of Hollywood glamor in its heyday. The Coens show us, in highly entertaining fashion, the excesses of movie stars and the constant covert machinations to sustain their image as moral, upstanding citizens.

7623962,4,B01B8836R6,"Hollywood. The 1950s. The Golden Age of filmmaking. Those who live there live on top of it all. Unless you're studio fixer Eddie Mannix, and our studio's most famous actor has just been kidnapped. Mannix races against time to gather the ransom, all the while dealing with an unraveling spiral of secrets and lies and the quirkiness that is Hollywood.

The Coen Brothers make, essentially, two types of films: comedies, and comedic melodramas that border on horror. No Country For Old Men and Fargo fall into the latter, and truthfully, these are the films I tend to enjoy more; their comedies can sometimes become downright crude. Not so with HAIL, CAESAR! While it's true this film has limited appeal outside of Coen fans (it's a very tongue-in-cheek love letter to the film industry), it's expertly made and has a wry sense of humor running beneath the surface. The script is solid, if not their best, and the acting is near-flawless. It's always nice having Josh Brolin in a lead role, and George Clooney clearly enjoys working with the Coens (though he tends to ham things up too much with them; here it sort of works). I won't go through the entire cast because, well, there was apparently a huge casting call, but Alden Ehrenreich is a standout; this could be a star-making vehicle for him, as he plays one of the more sympathetic characters--the film's aw-shucks moral center.

I know several Coen fans who didn't particularly care for this movie; and while it's true that it doesn't rank up there with their best--it's not even their best comedy--HAIL, CAESAR! is far from a wash. In fact, I feel kind of guilty having to defend it. It's a solid film that's worth repeated viewing, and does exactly what its masterful filmmakers set out to do. Isn't it kind of wrong for us to expect more?",1465171200,,1797,4.719745222929936

This day he has to deal with a unhappy director, covering up the pregnancy of a popular star and the disappearance of their lead actor in their biggest picture. Eddie jumps from fixing problem to problem while trying to decide on his own future. This is a movie that is almost review proof. The Coen brothers, for as big as they are and as famous as their movies are, are very polarizing. People either love everything they do, or avoid them. For me they are pretty hit or miss. They have done some movies I have really liked like Fargo, Big Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou...but they also did Burn After Reading which I didn't like at all. This one, while it was funny and I did laugh a few times was more like Burn After Reading than the others. The dialog is witty and fast paced, but the actual plot itself seemed to really drag and I found myself wondering how much longer it will go on. Overall, this is not a bad movie at all, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't.

Like all of the Coen Brothers' films, it's a mistake to take this one at ""face value"". Admittedly, it functions flawlessly as a laser - accurate, albeit loving, satire of a bygone era in Hollywood movie history. However, beneath that technically dazzling and apparently aimless facade lies a thematic unity that lifts the film above the common level. I call it a Comedy of Faith: an unbiased, humorous meditation on human beings' fundamental need for belief and its absurd and often destructive results. A few salient examples: the angry writers' (and Channing Tatum's character's) quasi-religious devotion to Communism; the eponymous Roman/Biblical epic starring Clooney's character; the leap of faith required of an actor in any role; the debate over cinematic content between the rabbi, the priest, and the minister; and (centrally) Eddie Mannix's ultimately unbreakable faith in the Dream of Hollywood, the Magic of the Movies. It's a very American phenomenon, this addiction to the Big Dream; and the Coens have all four of their eyes trained in that direction in the insightful and delightful ""Hail, Caesar"".",1464998400,3,1211,5.27979274611399

7623982,2,B01B8836R6,"Hail Caesar is presented as a loopy, light-hearted lark, a nostalgic parody of 1950's Hollywood.  Its prominent cast portray thinly-veiled counterparts of many memorable Hollywood stars.  Like any Coen Bros. comedy, it has its moments.  Unfortunately, this sugar cube has a Strychnine center; as it lumbers to its conclusion, its heavy-handed politics crush all of the fun out of it.  No doubt the Coens have congratulated themselves for creating characters who are contrary to their conventional images, but these contrarian portrayals play ugly politics.

The premise is simple:  What if American intellectuals and Hollywood screenwriters really were stooges for the Soviet Union?  The studio's (and America's) only defense is Josh Brolin's fixer.  He is not the typically slimy Hollywood fixer, but a pious Catholic (who actually wears out his priest) and family man whose ingenuity keeps the studio running.  He is a true believer, carrying out the will of the unseen studio chief while working tirelessly to complete filming of a Ben Hur type of picture.  The political and religious themes of this film reach their climax when Brolin's character slaps around the naively Communist movie star as if he were the man's enraged father:  ""How dare you speak ill of the Job Creator?  You owe everything to him!""  It is only one among many references equating the unseen studio chief with God.

Had the Coens targeted history's other persecuted groups, there would have been howls of outrage from the audience.  They've picked their target well, however; no one has arisen to defend the reputations of the screenwriters and intellectuals who were publicly humiliated, often jailed, and deprived of their livelihoods.

It's surprising that there is no fictional counterpart to Joe McCarthy in this film.  It its Bizarro world, Tailgunner Joe would have been a hero.",1464912000,2,1863,5.239864864864865

(Especially liked the somewhat lengthy song and dance number with Tatum Channing, which set up the irony of him being the real Soviet agent). Generally, though, I find most of the Coen's over-the-top interludes between their more serious films (and extremely significant) sort of increasingly annoying. Trying to decide whether or not to find ""silly"" the left-wing writers who were blacklisted by Hollywood, i.e. presenting their ideas as boring and inept and inventing a kidnapping to make them seem more ridiculous, I found offensively trivializing. Even ""Trumbo"", for its Hollywoodizing of the blacklist issue, was a more serious look at this phenomenon. If the writers could have been found ridiculous at the time, lives would not have been ruined by the studios and their blacklist. (I mean could Dalton Trumbo have written this movie under the pseudonym of the Coens? I doubt if he would have been willing to do that, even for the money!)",1464825600,,1035,5.166666666666667

I found it very fun, and really enjoyed George Clooney having a philosophic discussion about the benefits of communism and then Brolin's character slapping that silliness out of him!

Lots of twists and turns and surprises from some great actors (including 2 actors I hadn't seen together since ""Highlander"") especially Scarlett Johansson!  She proves yet again what a flexible actress she is... if she wasn't already playing Black Widow in the Marvel films she would have been PERFECT as Harley Quinn in the DC universe.

Hopefully there will be a directors cut as I feel that some material might have been cut.  If you liked ""O Brother Where for art thou?"" you will probably like this.  Not only was it funny but it had great cinematography and some scenes reminiscent of the classic films of the 30's and 40's.

Certain bits are given full loving treatment where you might expect a brief snippet -- scenes that are both tongue in cheek but also quite good in their own right -- a dance scene, which works as a tribute to Gene Kelly, an aquatic number which is a nod to Esther Williams. George Clooney is fine as a bumbling, sincere Hollywood star, pretty much accustomed to waking up and not knowing quite where he is, and handling it with aplomb. There are several small roles, little more than cameos, that are wonderful: I did not know Scarlett Johannsen could be that funny; I knew Frances McDormand could. Ralph Fiennes is terrific.

  Great cast, particularly Alden Ehrenreich as cowboy star Hobie Doyle. The scene where he is being coached by a Britsh director played (hilariously) by Ralph Fiennes is brilliantly funny.

Paranoid studio publicity people, competing gossip columnists, closeted gay directors and stars - all this on top of epic movies ""with a cast of thousands.""

Maybe they are people who have grown up in decades after the ""Hail, Caesar"" Hollywood disappeared.  I loved this movie.  My absolutely favorite scenes are those with Alden Ehrenreich (in the 50's, they would have made him change his name).  I never heard of Ehrenreich until I saw this movie, but he steals the scenes he's in. . .  an old-fashioned Western hero!  Josh Brolin also is great here, as is Ralph Fiennes.  The scene in which Feinnes tries to teach Ehrenreich how to speak in a posh British accent is hysterical.  Chaning Tatum shows himself to have talent that would have made him a star back in the 40's and 50's, unlike so many of his contemporaries who just don't have the ramge that well-trained actors had back then.

And I'm not a big fan of most of the Coen brothers movies, which are usually so overloaded with bizarre quirky characters doing bizarre quirky things in normal settings that I can't but help lose the plot from thinking, ""hey, this doesn't make sense""

Hollywood, of course is anything but a normal setting - people in the industry have been doing bizarre quirky things for a long time, and so their style works perfectly in this nostalgic spoof of a 1950's era Hollywood movie studio.

What to say but that there are terrific performances from a long list of fine actors.  Clooney, Johannsson, and Fiennes are brilliant in comedic roles.  Channing Tatum was dazzling and hilarious, both in his tap-dancing routine and his transformation into the Soviet Man (he's done comic roles before - it suits him well).  Josh Brolin anchors the movie with a solid performance as the central character Eddie Mannix, the movie studio fixer whose job it is to keep all these characters in line and making movies.  And relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich steals the show in a totally charming performance.

And another twist - the Coen brothers do a different take on the Communist screenwriters of that era,  portraying them not in the usual Politically Correct way as the victims of McCarthyism (see movie ""Trumbo""), but instead making gentle fun of them as the utterly befuddled, and mildly dangerous slaves of Soviet Stalinism that they were.

[Note bene:  McCarthy was a dangerous demagogue and democratic socialism does have a role in our modern high tech capitalist society, but you gotta call a spade a spade, and history has shown that these Communist screenwriters were blinded by their idealism into slavishly following a particularly horrific and subversive ideology - Soviet Stalinism - and most never admitted to their mistakes, including Dalton Trumbo]

 The wonderful Coen brothers, the sibling team of writer/director/producers that have given us such memorable films as ""No Country for Old Men"", ""True Grit (2010)"" and many others again have made a film that we will find worth watching, if not a film aspiring to the greatness of the two mentioned.  This farce will entertain viewers and many of the carefully written and directed small scenes really will delight us.  The Coen brothers made ""Hail Caesar"" with the care, dedication and expertise  of genuine craftsmen.
 They also brought a huge list of well known actors, including four Oscar winners and three additional Oscar nominees.  Little explosions of short bits of really terrific acting light up an otherwise light weight film.
 Even the story line has the typical Coen brothers odd cast to it.  In March of 1952 Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) stars in one of the Biblical epics of that era, ""Hail Caesar"".  A coven of communist movie writers, unhappy at their compensation and befuddled by communist literature, kidnap the star and hold him for ransom as a way of striking a blow for the proletariat.  Their guru is Professor Herbert Marcuse, a real life communist university professor of the day.  I found veteran character actor John Bluthal spot on as he mouthed the complicated, impenetrable discourse that Marcuse favored.  I wouldn't be surprised that the Coen brothers as writers actually quoted Marcuse, a writer that I struggled through 50 years ago.
 Josh Brolin plays hard bitten studio fixer Eddie Mannix.  In those days when the studio ruled the actors there actually were guys whose job it was to cover up the social excesses of the indentured performers.  New to me actor Alden Ehrenreich plays a young singing cowboy actor named Hobie Doyle with an innocent authenticity that totally charmed me.  Doyle is a straight shooter, earnest in his efforts to do as the directors and producers ask.  He has come a long way from his days as a cowpuncher and he knows it.  He has a wonderful scene with a Carmen Miranda style actress in an arranged date (studios did that as well, treating the performers private lives as part of the actors job).  He entertains her by doing mini rope tricks with a strand of spaghetti.
 Also given small scenes to do well in are Tilda Swinton, who plays twin, feuding gossip columnist sisters and Scarlett Johansson as an Ester Williams style aquatic actress.  Johansson manages the instant switch from on camera princess to off camera blue collar bitch with an authenticity that makes us wonder about her.  Channing Tatum plays a dancer and if we judge from the movie, he really can dance.  Jonah Hill has a small role, again showing that he can do more than comedy.  Ralph Fiennes plays a flamboyant gay director who shows enormous patience in directing the miss-cast cowboy star in a period costume drama.  His brother Joseph is currently starring in ""Risen"".  Frances McDormand plays a film editor in a brilliant three minute scene.  She and Joel Coen are husband and wife in real life.
 This film exists as a carrier for a series of delightful little scenes, the film as a whole entertains but no more than that.  This makes, to my knowledge, the first film which puts the focused communist penetration of Hollywood in a bad light, compare with the recent ""Trumbo"".  And the Coens as directors send up the bombastic epics of the 1950s as well, with the low quality sets and over acting in the scenes of the film within a film shots of the ""Hail Caesar"" production.
 ""Hail Caesar"" merits an average three saw blades for its one hour and 46 minutes of entertainment.  The Coens made this ""PG-13"" comedy/mystery for a frugal $22 million and should do well with it as it has already taken in some $40 million world wide.

See it again and again and the theme jumps out. It's about faith, and ways that we - who are so confident of our understanding of the world, even though we're actually clueless - rely on faith and how we find our individual paths to it.

The western cowboy actor is funny and the scene of Lazy Ol Moon is hilarious. And the song is so sad and nostalgic. He sounds like my Swedish friend City Cowboy singing Peter Pan ([...]) : nostalgia of the good old days when we were young, children, toddlers.

The kidnapping or abduction of the Roman legionnaire (Clooney) by some communists and his instant Stockholm syndrome is funny and the treatment of this PTSS by his boss at the studio is even more than funny since he is treated like a child with four slaps across the face. Which does not make him lose his Latin, but definitely makes him lose his faith.

The deeply superficial discussion of Jesus by four people, a rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Orthodox patriarch and what is going to be assumed to be a simple Protestant Joe Blow is absurd but so cut off from reality and from the real question about Jesus that we feel we have been dumped in some loony-bin. I just wonder why the children of Ismail, Abrahams first son, in other words the Arabs, in other words the Muslims have not been included. Or is that not kosher enough for the Coen Brothers?

The sudden conversion of the Roman Legionnaire to Christianity, though the actor has just been boxed over the ears by his boss and told to please do the only thing he is paid for, be a star, would have been convincing, nearly convincing, at best hypocritical, if he had not lost his faith. You see god exists and he is looking after us and the dumb things we may be doing or saying.

The Soviet submarine in Malibu is so unreal and all that happens then is so absurd that we wonder if the Coen brothers are laughing at the Russians, hence Putin, or the West, hence NATO and the USA. One thing is sure the red danger is quite a farce and the only danger we are running into is just forgotten. It is true Jesus dies at the 9th hour and he is buried at the 11th hour. Are the Coen brothers making fun of our fear in aftermath of 9/11 though we use 911 at any moment in the daytime and at night for any little trivial family affair or marital disagreement.

The Russian songs used in the film though are of course the Red Armys rendition of them, and I loved Kalinka that I taught in Russian to my French students and to my colleagues Spanish students in Dunn, North Carolina, in 1970. The Americans have always loved those popular and traditional Russian songs and the Red Army here is probably the only real, realistic and true note (for music it is the good word) in the film. Lets say authentic.

7624028,4,B01B8836R6,"The film takes place circa 1951 and centers on Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a film producer for Capitol Films. He is faced with a number of issues which he must solve while trying to give up smoking. His main headache is Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the star of his epic film ""Hail Caesar."" He has been kidnapped and ransomed by a communist cell during film production. Meanwhile he he forced to miscast cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who can't act in a societal comedy/drama.

The feature spoofs the gloss and crap that came from that era as films had a monopoly on entertainment. We see a Carmen Miranda type (Veronica Osorio), Channing Tatum dancing like Gene Kelly in ""Anchors Away""; Scarlett Johansson as Esther Williams in ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" and George Clooney plays a Richard Burton type in ""The Robe."" Hobie Doyle was a generic singing cowboy with a ""Gabby Hayes"" sidekick.

The Coen film holds some enjoyment for those familiar with the era. There were some good exchanges such as the theological debate and Jonah Hill talking about being a professional person-hood. It comically shows the Hollywood 10 black listed doing unorthodox things. The main problem with this feature is that it is a Coen Brothers film, so the bar has been set Raising Arizona high. If this was a new director/writer they would be hailed as genius.

They literally don't make them like this anymore, as the movie is largely an excuse to feature several outdated genres. With big sequences like tap-dancing, synchronized swimming and cowpoke-stunt pieces that haven't appeared on film in decades, the movie displays a variety of all but extinct genres which once dominated the box office, and is almost like a stroll through a cinematic museum.

The film ambitiously tries to marry a slew of big ideas together  religion, work, economic systems, publicity, filmmaking. However, the final product is an undercooked batch of half-baked ideas, never synthesizing into a smart, syncopated story that fans would expect from such intelligent craftsmen.

7624030,4,B01B8836R6,"Directors: Joel and Ethan Coen

Screenplay: Joel and Ethan Coen

Cast: Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlet Johansson, and a boatload of others you will recognize including The Highlander!

I want to start this off by simply saying, Josh Brolin is todays Humphrey Bogart.  The man knows how to rock a fedora and deliver a knuckle sandwich to any nosebleed who doesnt know how to treat a dame (more on this in my Gangster Squad review).  Its hard to believe that while Joel and Ethan Coen have managed to tackle westerns, crime, folk music, The Odyssey, even bowling, they have yet to take aim at the very business that has made them so successful for over 30 years, cinema!  Hail, Caesar! rectifies this glaring omission in their filmography and as impeccably as one would expect.

Hail, Caesar! has a plot, but thats not why its good.  Basically, the film follows studio executive, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) as he attempts to keep his talent in line by covering up scandals and fixing production mishaps.  The films title is a reference to Mannixs big-budget prestige picture for the studio starring mega-star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) that tells the story of the Christ.  When Whitlock suddenly goes missing, Mannix searches the studio lot for clues to his whereabouts.

Like I said, the key to this film is not the plot.  Like most classic cinema, the plot is a device to direct the entertainment.  The Coens revel in the glory days of cinema as Whitlocks disappearance leads Mannix to wander from studio set to studio set and consequently from beautifully staged genre scene to beautifully staged genre scene.  Hail, Caesar! gives the Coens license to film Gene Kelly- style musical numbers, Gary Cooper-style western scenes, Esther Williams-style synchronized swimming spectacles, and high society dramatic capers all within the context of one goofy plotline.

Furthermore, the screen is filled with trademark quirky characters, some of which look to be lost from a Wes Anderson movie (Im talking to you Ralph Fiennes!).  Still, an important consideration is that my admiration for this film has little, almost nothing, to do with the characters or the actors.  The closest thing to a classic and fully developed character comes in the form of Alden Ehrenreichs role as a Gene Autry-type western actor named Hobie Doyle who is forced into a role that is way out of his comfort zone. His battle with the phrase, Would that it were so simple is very enjoyable.  Otherwise, the reason to see this film is for its harkening back to the classic days of cinema through the lens of the Coen brothers.  The all-star cast may get people in the seats, but this film will disappoint if you are expecting to spend much time with some of your favorite movie stars.  In fact, recognizable faces are strung together in such a way that once one actor goes off screen another comes in; its like a wack-a-mole of Hollywood stars.  Put simply, this is a movie for people who have a fondness for the art and presentation of the movies themselves.  If your ears perk up when a character is introduced as Carlotta Valdez, then this is a movie for you.

I make this distinction about Hail Caesar! because I feel it can disappoint if audiences go in with the wrong mindset, but it will dazzle and entertain if they go in with another.  While the film celebrates the importance of plot and actors, you almost have to put all of that aside to fully enjoy this movie.  In fact, the preposterous climactic scene involving the acts of a group of Communists is so absurd, the Coens are basically begging you to reexamine the point of this film.  Hail, Caesar! is a blast though, and likely not a coincidence that it is released amidst wider releases of all of the 2015 Oscar contenders.  The film revels in the eminence of motion pictures and can be seen as perhaps a thoroughly satisfying appetizer worth seeing before this years Academy Awards. B+

7624032,3,B01B8836R6,"Hail Cesar is a slow burner, for sure.  It's not the Coen's best, and if I'm to compare it to any of their movies, itd be Hudsucker Proxy.  Both are tributes to another era and both deal with characters wrestling to do what's right. Indeed, there's something very innocent about this movie.

The movie follows a producer/fixer trying to keep the actors and actresses afloat at Capitol Pictures ny making sure they avoid any scandal that would mark them.  It mainly focuses on this character and his exploits as well as his conscience in continuing to do this job.  Brolins character is very likeable as it shows him as a good family man and frequent comfesser to even the tiniest of sins.

In true Coen form, however, we have a quirky ensemble.  George Clooney is the most visible, as a mega star making an epic Ben Hur style movie, suddenly dragged into a unique scandal.

The cinematography is beautiful.  There are a couple song amd dance numbers that are loving tributes to old Hollywood.  The story is sufficient, if a little slow moving at parts.

In the world of the Coens, this is not their best movie by a long shot.  They spend a little long writing their love letter that some scenes really drag.  The attention to detail is a little too good in that regard.

But there is a lot to love.  Notably, the performances and some of their choices in small roles.  Christopher Lambert makes an appearance, as well as his old Highlander rival Clancy Brown.  Robert Picardo of star trek/Joe Dante film fame makes a hilarious appearance as a Rabbi.  Then theres an all too brief appearance from Wayne Knight.

I have a feeling, like all Coen films, this will get better with age.  The characters will keep me coming back.  Also, in all its flaws, it's probably one of the best films to pay tribute to a long gone film era.",1458086400,25,1823,4.530674846625767

Here are six words I thought I would never say about a Coen Brothers picture - It. Just. Wasnt. A. Good. Film. More so, it wasn't a very interesting film, either. Nor all that funny. I caught myself laughing out loud only twice. First, when Ralph Fiennes is trying to explain to Alden Ehrenreichs character of a stuntman turned actor how to deliver the line, Would that it were so simple. (Ruefully) HILARIOUS! Secondly, when Frances McDormands character is almost choked to death by a film projector. Its this kind of surprising, dry and absurd humor that I wish was sprinkled throughout the film a lot more.

As is the usual with a Coen Brothers film, casting was first ratewith the exception of Channing Tatum. Luckily, his screen time was minimal and based on his dancing more than his acting (as it should be). Everyone brought their A-Game which was great to see but sadly didn't make up for how stereotypical and two-dimensional these characters were written, as well as the fact that you don't really care about any of them.

He is presented as a work obsessed practical man who is juggling plates. The story is ridiculous with George Clooney - a big star character - being kidnapped by Communists. Many of the scenes take on the 'film within a film' approach with a wild west scene, a synchronized swimming  scene, a posh dinner party scene, a hilarious tap dancing scene, and even a scene shot by the light of the silvery moon. Clooney, plays a Roman soldier centurion type of character from the film 'Hail Caesar', itself not a million miles away from 'Ben Hur' especially as it focuses so much on Jesus , The Christ much as that real film did.  We never see Clooney dressed normally, when he is kidnapped he is still wearing his Roman costume.

The Coens couldn't resist throwing in a submarine, further blurring fact from fiction in a scene that blows me away with the music, the humour and just how frankly bizarre it is. Pure Coens magic.

This film brings to mind some of the big life questions about what is true and what is not: the McCarthy era hysteria, communist ideology, and references to Jesus are handled in a gently mocking way. It is difficult to know where these two culturally Jewish directors stand in terms of the big questions of life. I doubt they are life experts. I don't doubt they are film making experts. Stories are not real, but how do you know what is a story and what is history? There is something Werner Herzogesque in this film from the brothers. I don't think it will appeal to the masses as it is perhaps a bit unfocused in terms of plot but i think it will stand up well to re watches as all their films generally do. I'm not sure I give a flying fig about the Josh Brolin character and he has too much screen time for me.

7624043,3,B01B8836R6,"Imagine the madcap Hollywood antics of Barton Fink cranked up to another, more frantic tone and you've got the Coen Brothers' Hail, Caesar! in a nutshell. The film is both a zany love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and a somewhat pillowy rebuke of its flaws, but with its string of musical numbers and wide array of gorgeous celebrity co-stars it works best as an enjoyable variety show. This journey down memory lane is worth the trip but won't rank among the brothers' more substantial efforts.

Set in 1950s Hollywood, the film stars Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, a big studio ""fixer"" running Capitol Pictures. Basically, Eddie's job is to keep the trains running and the stars where they need to be, but he's having misgivings about the whole thing. The Coens add an odd religious tone right from the outset as Eddie confesses his sins to a priest, a daily occurrence, apparently. The strangely-flavored film shows Eddie to be both a saint, at least in Hollywood terms, and yet a guy who casually slaps around an actress for taking racy photographs.

It's hard to tell where the Coens are coming from until the plot, or what passes for one, kicks in. It involves the kidnapping of the studio's top star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), from the set of their biggest film,  a Ben-Hur style epic in which he plays a Roman general who comes to believe in the power of Christ. It's over-the-top and ridiculous, of course, with Clooney goofing around in numbskull mode, which is exactly how the Coens like him. Meanwhile, poor Eddie never gets a moment to breathe. He's being courted by Lockheed Martin for the budding aviation industry, he's dealing with Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich, brilliantly stupid) a moronic Western star who has been forced into a drawing room drama for seriously perplexed director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), who can't understand why the actor can't drop his twangy southern drawl.  Scarlett Johansson dives in as a promiscuous starlet with an image problem, while Channing Tatum sings and dances in his sailor suit during the film's most outstanding scene. He isn't in the film long, but Tatum captures the glow and style of an old-fashioned Hollywood star.

The Coens glorify in the little details, and film historians will no doubt have a ton of fun picking up on them. There's Tilda Swinton as the twin gossip rag columnists (they always appear one right after the other) digging up dirt on Eddie's stars, who are frequently put into phony romantic relationships just to help build their public personas. Best is Frances McDormand as a chain-smoking, celluloid-loving editor chomping her way to a nearly fatal end.  There's just as much that doesn't work, including the reveal of Baird's kidnappers, members of a Communist think tank who proceed to fill his empty head full of anti-capitalist rhetoric. The dialogue simply isn't as sharp during these scenes, and the Coens let it drag on far too long with little payoff.

The whole thing is kind of a mess, but a happy, nostalgic mess. The film concludes with Mannix making a final confession that suggests the Coens were aiming for deeper meaning, but it's as phony as the over lit studio backlots where vacuous celebs ply their trade.",1455667200,3,3231,4.8743169398907105

Scarlett Johanson's character is playing a mermaid in a movie. But she's pregnant and her tail doesn't fit. And she doesn't know who the father is. Nothing to do with anything.
Channing Tatum is a singing navy boy. Nothing to do with anything.
George Clooney's character gets drunk and kidnapped by communists.
The communists ask for ransom. The ransom gets paid. And then they leave him unattended so a very country actor can rescue him. Kind of.
Channing Tatum and his navy boys run into a communist submarine. Nothing to do with anything.
George Clooney comes back influenced by communism. Josh Brolin slaps the nonsense out of him.
He films his final scene in Hail Caesar! and everyone is amazed by his performance. The end.

I went to see this movie on a date. We tried to make sense of the movie. The only reason we didn't migrate to the theater next to this one was because there was a shady couple in there smoking weed. And it was a horror movie. My date didn't like horror movies.
But we had a good laugh over how stupid this movie was.",1455580800,14,1328,4.460905349794238

8749605,5,B01B8836R6,"I've seen Hail, Caesar now about four times, and each time I find something new to obsess over. Lately it's been the scene with Lawrence Laurens and Hobie Daniels, as they hash out the pronunciation of the Director's name. Earlier, it was the scenes with the journalist twins vying for the studio's dirty laundry. This movie should have been three times as long, because there's somuch of this story to tell. I love it.",1535932800,,419,4.675675675675675
8749606,5,B01B8836R6,"I have seen the film twice now and I am just blown away by the artfulness of the filmmaking, the intelligence of the script, and the charm of the wonderful performances. ""Hail, Caesar"" is a smart and loving tribute to American film of the 1950s. Look how cleverly and delightfully the Coens move us among various entertainment genres of the era in carrying us through the intriguing and humorous plot: Biblical epic, swimming movie, singing cowboy, sailors on the loose musical, ""quality"" drama about urban sophisticates. I also love the lack of cynicism. The main characters in the film are the solid, grounded, sincerely moral people who are comfortable in who they are and want to do what is right. The swimming movie star (Scarlett Johansson) is looking for a decent, dependable man and when she finds one in an unexpected place, she woos him. The studio chief is perfectly portrayed by square-jawed Josh Brolin. It's such a relief to see a depiction of studio head who is the opposite of the usual portrayal: Mr. Mannix is amazing at his job, honest, faithful to his wife, and turns down temptation (except for the occasional cigarette--but he's working on it.)  He's the fascinating moral core around which the plot spins. The singing cowboy is unforgettably played by Alden Ehrenreich. He has not fallen for the Hollywood seductions of fakery and power games. He is happy being his talented self. Alden even learned to do fancy lasso tricks for this film, a delight to see. There is so much more about this rich, smart, smooth, and captivating movie. Political humor! Historical humor! Channing Tatum singing and dancing like you won't believe! I really love it.",1535932800,,1669,4.897526501766785
8749607,5,B01B8836R6,"This movie is a bit 'inside', meaning it works better if you know the inner workings of tinseltown, but that's about the only thing negative I can say.  It's just too highbrow to earn 5 stars in a world where movies have become nothing but 'transformered'. Loved it.",1535241600,,266,4.541666666666667

8749610,3,B01B8836R6,"I think those who see this as some sort of love letter to Golden Age Hollywood are missing the point. Its a subversion. The reality is there were leftists, especially among writers. A lot of people seem to take the communists writers group as making fun of the communist writers. No. Its making fun of the very idea that there were leftist writers. Ho hum, St. Trumbo, yes, I get it. And Taylor Channing can dance, but he turns something like from Follow the Fleet into a homosexual subtext. Yawn.

Why does MGM fixer Eddie Mannix walk around through deserted lots? Where is the bustle of a big studio? That looks cheap and sloppy.

So why three stars? There are some very watchable scenes and a brainwashed George Clooney spouting Communist propaganda getting slapped by Josh Brolins Mannix is worth a star by itself. The scene where the cowboy star cant say his line no matter how patiently hes coached is worth another one. There are others good enough for another star and it hits a (very) few accurate marks from Golden Age Hollywood.

But make no mistake: this was not made with love for its subject.",1534118400,,1106,4.604060913705584

8749612,4,B01B8836R6,"Simply put, George Clooney plays an idiot. If you came to this movie looking for him to be some sort of classic Hollywood hero, you're going to be very disappointed, because the whole point of his character is ""What if Victor Mature were really stupid?"" Don't know who Victor Mature is? This is not the film for you. The movie is full of parodies, and what makes them great is that the Coens know the sources they're riffing on and they do their best to equal the original Technicolor bombast of the classic musicals? Are things somewhat ridiculous, overwrought, and accidentally homerotic? Have you ever seen those old films? Of course they are! So Channing Tatum is the young, athletic dumb blond sailor, while Scarlett Johansson is the not so dumb swimming champion now trapped in ridiculous studio follies. Tilda Swinton takes on the gossip mavens of yore, and Josh Brolin digs into his comic side to bring up a convincing noir Clark Gable/Fred MacMurray mishmash. The sets are brightly lit, the costumes are period perfect, and there's some sort of nonsense about a Russian or German sub off the California coast, but it's really all about a mash note to the messy past of the city of so many dreams, only this time all the artificial seams are showing. And some stars were just really really lucky bozos.",1533686400,,1310,4.724890829694323
8749613,5,B01B8836R6,"I hate the pack mentality of reviews these days!  Hail Caesar is not the best of all Coen's film but it is probably in their top five which puts it in the overall top 1% of films made lately.  I will bet a lot of money that a third of the people who didn't like it simply didn't understand it, and another third just followed the pack and didn't give it a chance.  If your taste is for very intelligent social commentary and satire in a very entertaining form, you should not miss this film.  If you like things dumbed down and spoon-fed to you, and/or you don't know or care much about the US in the 1950s, you might not like the plot because it might be making fun of you while the humor flies over your head.  But then again you might like it anyway if you give it a chance because some of the scenes are really funny just on their own terms.",1533168000,,845,4.066265060240964
