1888815,5,B00009RDGK,"I like this Teletubbies DVD because it includes some educational content: counting, colors, size (big/small). My son loves ALL the Teletubbies DVDs, so I'm just happy to have one with a little bit of learning.",1125705600,5,209,5.0
1888816,4,B00009RDGK,"We only have one Teletubby DVD, so I can't compare it to the many others. My 13-month-old loves the TV show so we got her this mainly to keep her happy when we go on trips. She loves the usual Tubby stuff: changing color screen with various numbers of Tubbies learning up, down, big and small. And the live action sequences are very good. The kids in Taiwan with their parachute, the Russian girl with her dogs and the East Indian woman telling a story all hold her attention. But the actual ""What's That?"" sequence with the periscope, endlessly ringing bells over and over - which then stop with no explanation of what they were, after all the Teletubbies have gathered near it one by one to say ""What's That?"" repeatedly... what WAS that?! But the ""What color is Tubby custard?"" sequence is great fun, as is the familiar sequence of Tubbies with their favorite things. My daughter loves it and that's what counts!",1073088000,13,915,4.585365853658536

7992774,5,B00009RDGK,I Can't believe a show that annoyed me many years ago is now one of our family favorite with our babies.,1396396800,,104,4.0
7992775,5,B00009RDGK,"Full of fun, happiness, education, and hugs! My 2&1/2 year old would watch it all day if I let her. Not the normal full episode, but flows nicely.",1389139200,,146,4.25
7992776,5,B00009RDGK,"Teletubbies got a bad rap! I babysit for alot of babies and let me tell you...when you need a group of 1 yr olds to be entertained, this is it! They sit and stare for 20-30 minutes..long past their attention span. Then they get up and dance with the Teletubbies til it is over!! Rock on Tinky Winky, Lala, Poe and Dipsy",1325721600,,319,4.161290322580645

7992778,4,B00009RDGK,"This is a decent DVD.  Weird that it doesn't follow the usual Teletubbies TV show format, but entertaining nonetheless.  My son much prefers ""Go!  Exercise With The Teletubbies"".",1226793600,,178,5.285714285714286
7992779,5,B00009RDGK,As long as my baby enjoys it then that's all that matters. Personally I don't care for it.,1214006400,,90,4.055555555555555
