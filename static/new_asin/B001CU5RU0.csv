""Old bike . . . even older lady ballet teacher . . . Wisconsin Plates . . . AWESOME adventure"".
After close to a month ""riding sunny Calif"" on my own . . .  I seem to recall seeing the Modern Marvels PCH program upon my return to reality.
And now, almost 10 years later something possessed me to do a ""search"" for the DVD.
The production of this DVD features a BMW sports car traveling North on Hwy 1 from San Diego to Canada.  I felt like I was ""on the road again"" and especially LOVED the historical info on the construction of not only the hwy but the many bridges along the way.  From the Bixby to the Golden Gate . . .  everything in between and after . . . San Simeion to Big Sur . . . the Missions of Santa Barbara and San Louis Obisbo AWESOME.  Now, I want to do it again ! !
