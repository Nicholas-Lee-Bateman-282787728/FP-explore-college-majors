8238759,5,B0010W4A58,"Truly Amazing:  Loved being able to see the changes and how the landscapes come together.  This DVD (all the DVD's) are thoughtfully organized and genuinely a delight to watch, and re-watch.  Getting to visually know Paul, his perspective, values and creative style,  enhances his credibility and adds confidence to any major landscape change which, if Paul is involved, are essentially guaranteed to generate significant return on investment with years of enjoyment and increased property value.  Kudos to Paul for taking the time to create beautiful visual histories and to share his inspiration.",1386806400,,598,5.456521739130435
8238760,5,B0010W4A58,"Amazing Landscapes Vol. 1 is beautiful to watch and educational. I showed this DVD to a friend who was remodeling his backyard, he was blown away! I enjoy being able to see long time lapses of the projects he has completed. This gives a very good idea of how everything grows in to make the landscapes amazing. If you have a landscape that needs transformation, buy this series of DVD's...Check it out!",1357603200,,402,4.597222222222222
8238761,5,B0010W4A58,As I web searching a lot of Hill side design and idea. Finally got this wonderful / Beautiful design. I can't imagine moving thousand and thousand stone and set up on the Hill side. Made the slope become beautiful just by 2 manpower. I like it !!,1344643200,,246,4.25531914893617
8238762,5,B0010W4A58,"I watched Paul's video and thought it was really well done.  Lots of good ideas (I took notes) and even had him come to my house and bid a job for me.  Turned out really nice, plus since it is low water, I am getting a rebate from the city.  Anyways, Paul is quite creative/artistic and is a hard working, honest dude...what you see is what you get.  Plus he has been doing this a long time, so he knows where to go to get the best deals/prices on materials.",1328400000,,458,4.055555555555555
8238763,5,B0010W4A58,"I am fortunate to own the author's now out-of-print book.  His video CD's offer an excellent resource necessary to anyone, expert or novice, who is interested in block/stone type hardscaping.  His blend of soft and hardscapes gives the user an endless source of ideas. The author, Paul Nordmark, calls himself, on his business card, a ""Structure Artist"".  After viewing his videos, I believe most people will call his title an understatement.  He truly is blessed with a talent that comes through in vivid colors and structures.

Paul, keep up the great work and continue to inspire others.
