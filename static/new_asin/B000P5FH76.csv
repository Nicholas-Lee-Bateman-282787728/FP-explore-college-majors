2811771,5,B000P5FH76,"I enjoy this show and watching these girls and boys plan their sweet sixteens. I find the things they must go through to make their parties ""perfect"" to be amusing. I also enjoyed the Super Sweet Sixteen movie. I think my favorite part of the movie was when the band Hellogoodbye performed. They are one of my favorite bands and it was absolutely amazing to see them make an appearance in the My Super Sweet Sixteen movie. I think that anyone who would find spoiled kids throwing fits and tantrums over their sweet sixteen parties to be humorous should definitely check out the show and movie!",1187568000,2,593,4.60377358490566

8189064,3,B000P5FH76,I thought the movie was a little fun. Everybody likes to plan parties! But I thought the acting could have been better with some of the cast.,1404777600,,141,4.2592592592592595
8189065,5,B000P5FH76,"I am 18 and i bought this movie just yesterday, i just love it!!! I've watched numerous times in the years it's been out and i rented it almost every-time i went to the video store with my dad, but now since they don't have video stores available in my area, i thought i would buy it so i could own it and have always wanted to own it ever since i saw it on tv the year after it came out and that was the year i was turning 16 in 08. My how the years ago and to this day, this movie makes me feel like a young teen again even though i am still young. Aly and AJ rock in the movie as well as the other actors.
I recommend to this to any age!",1329091200,,640,3.6449275362318843
8189066,5,B000P5FH76,"The Michalka's are super hot, and the movie is exactly like the TV show. Fortunately, real actors make the movie much better than the show.",1305158400,,139,4.6
8189067,2,B000P5FH76,"This is nothing more than an extremely poor attempt at selling political ideas to kids in a creative way. It's boring, with a weak plot and surprisingly lackluster acting from Ali and AJ who are usually good performers. I bought it for my 8 year old daughter because she likes their singing and enjoyed ""Cow Belles."" But I think even a parent with Liberal ideology (which is what this film blatantly pushes), would be embarassed by this pathetic attempt at entertainment.  To say I was disappointed would be a huge understatement.",1260921600,,530,4.824175824175824
8189068,5,B000P5FH76,This movie I bought as Christmas gift for someone who asked for it. But I'm told by her it's a great movie.,1222732800,,107,3.909090909090909
8189069,2,B000P5FH76,"I do not care for the TV series but its appeal was showcasing spoiled, out-of-control children of parents with more money than brains. However, I watched this movie because of Alyson and Amanda's (Aly & AJ) involvement. Unfortunately, without the reality appeal, the story was boring and the movie draggy. The acting was ok but the plot was weak and the script was unrealistic. I sensed a disconnect between the actors and the movie as if they were sleepwalking through it. It was a waste of all the actors' talents. Watch it as a dollar rental.",1201478400,2,545,4.6875
