8436020,5,B004MFT8WA,"I'm surprised how well the production company stuck with their goal of presenting this in a non-biased way.  I am biased though.  I went into this on Philipe Karl's side, and I still prefer his training style.

I come from a background of starting colts in western riding, but I'm very interested in english riding now.  We believe that it is wise to get them to flex to the left and right and give really well early on, as well as to learn maneuvers at a walk first.  Karl's approach is the same.",1374883200,2,497,4.301075268817204
8436021,5,B004MFT8WA,"Good discussion and demonstrations by Hess and Karl.  Both are extraordinaire horsemen but they do have differing opinions especially when it comes to the horse getting behind the vertical. Interestingly, it is Hess with the ""competition"" point of view that is more accepting of a horse being behind the vertical. Karl, the French trainer seems to be less emfluenced by Baucher's emphasis on flexion and insists on the ""classical"" view that the nose should be at or in front of the vertical most of the time.",1371168000,3,508,4.906976744186046
8436022,4,B004MFT8WA,"A very good discussion between two very well informed men from different perspectives of Dressage.
I have always liked what Christopher has to say and find this discussion of huge interest and implication to what is happening in Modern Dressage with Roll Kur up there as one of the most controversial methods ever.
Yes, we may well all be guilty in thinking that to train a horse behind the vertical is OK as the clever rider will lift the horse in a competition, but reading the book by Gerd Heuschmann ""Balancing Act: The horse in Sport-an Irreconcilable Conflict"" one has to consider the long term effect of such training. Phillippe Karl has for the last 20 years been one of my favorite writers of Training  with his book ""Long Reining"". He has also been able to keep a horse sound and happy in his work for 20 years,this is a testament to his theories of training a horse, poll high always. The French methods have always been considered 'wafty poetic stuff' however this methods give a horse a chance to willingly work with you.",1357603200,6,1034,4.619565217391305
8436023,5,B004MFT8WA,"Philippe Karl argues the point of dressage for all horses using a less popular type of horse and less advanced rider for competition demonstrating what can be achieved using the classique French methods while Christoph Hess uses a competition horse and rider training at Grand Prix level to demonstrate. Viewers with little knowledge of the philosophy and difference between the two methods may have difficulty truly understanding what they are viewing.
Reading Philippe Karl's book Twisted Truths of Modern Dressage before viewing would be beneficial to many. Having an understanding of different styles of training including Spanish is beneficial knowledge, unfortunately the flash of competition riding and the toll it takes on horses is far from the original values of dressage from which all horses can benefit when trained with the individual horse's welfare in mind above all other agendas.",1334102400,5,897,5.414285714285715
