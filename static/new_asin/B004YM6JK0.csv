4501810,5,B004YM6JK0,"This episode of Supernatural is a great start to the new season.

We are given in insight in to the memory of Sam's time in hell and what the memories are doing to him and how it will affect Dean and Bobby in the long run. There are many twist and turns and I will not spoil it for you by revealing to much, but his episode will make you think about what is real and what is not...

We are introduced to a very scary, evil and possessed Cas, played beautifully by Misha Collins. There are some very creepy and actually scary parts to this episode.

There is a return of some of our favorite characters: Crawley and Lucifer and Death. All three of these characters bring another level to the Supernatural story line.

This episode was written by Sara Gamble, one of the many producers for the series and she has written some of my favorite episodes and this will definitely go in to the favorite vault.

I highly recommend this episode!",1316822400,,935,4.350574712643678

4501850,3,B004YM6JK0,"BTW, spoiler alert.

Among fans, I think, this season is Supernatural's most controversial.  Despite some strong stand alone episodes and an ambitious season long story arc, the whole ends up being less than than the sum of the parts.

Season 6 was unfocused - with multiple, partly developed villains and little sense of forward momentum.

Season 7 was, obviously, intended to be a course correction with the introduction of the Leviathan as a season long villain.  Conceptually, the Leviathan are amazing - villains who have been locked away for all time are unleashed on the world; they can look like anyone and they can smoothly fit into society.  They have a master plan to enslave humanity.  It's a cool idea.  In practice, it wasn't effective.  Despite some creepy, vaguely disturbing acting by James Patrick Stuart as their leader, the Leviathan threat somehow failed to feel ""real"" and was instead a complex puzzle to be solved rather than an enemy to be defeated.  The final few episodes - in which Sam and Dean learn how to kill the Leviathan, collect the components of the weapon and finally manage to kill Dick Roman - make for compelling, interesting viewing.  And yet . . well, Kevin Tran's frantic line to Sam ""Dick's got creamer, he's going to kill all the skinny people"" is an unfortunately laughable moment in an otherwise taut episode.  And yet, even with all the challenges, the outcome felt too easy.

The stand alone episodes were an equally mixed bag - some such as ""Of Grave Importance"" deserve to be viewed several times.  Others, such as ""Party on Garth"" aim for and then miss humor and/or quirkiness.

I think it is fair to point out that season 7 is a perfect example of ambitious story telling, and a perfect example of the creative team not quite being up to realizing their ambitious story telling.  However, Season 7 sets up a number of important future plots namely the god tablets and Dean's year in purgatory; and it introduced Charlie Bradbury and Kevin Tran as characters, both of whom go one to become important (albeit in very different ways).

At the end of the day season 7 is important for Supernatural because it was pivotal - a season during which the show was struggling to find its creative footing after the 5 season long story arc (seasons 1-5).  If season 7 doesn't quite work on its own terms, it does succeed in setting up seasons 8, 9 and 10 which were compelling and interesting viewing.  Season 7 remains, for me, a mixed bag - better on a second viewing than it was on the first, arguably, Supernatural's most frustrating season.",1496620800,,2585,4.729910714285714

4501907,5,B004YM6JK0,"Another great season of my favorite WB20 show yes not CW it aired ON WB20 first along with Smallville actually to me.  I liked how they went deeper into the lore or about the leviathans.  Not everything can be about just humans or demons all the time or every episode dean kills a demon and saves the day.

Evil castial or possessed angel is always nice to have and great to us story lovers that love a twist or something new and different not told in the books.  Keeps the show very fresh and wanting to tune in next week for the next twist on what a angle should look like or feel like.

Video quality is very nice especially if u have a 4k home theater system like myself.  Do yourself a favor and watch supernatural in the dark with your 4k tv set to movie settings, sound bar or in my case put a extra 5 notches on teh master volume and keep the rear speakers and subwoofer close.

Audio is very clear and nice.  Anyone with a samsung soundbar and wireless radiant speakers set your surround system on and keep the master volume to 25 or higher.  Usually i directly connect my bluray player to the soundbar with hdmi arc to hear ddplus 7.1, but for this season i decided to use the 1 connectbox  and then use the fiber optic cable connected to my soundbar.  Not much or no hiccups, distortions, crack noises, but for me its still the hdmi arc straight connection from my player to the soundbar that sounds the best (plus the only way to hear atmos and DDPlus 7.1

Extras not too many but not few.  The usual deleted scenes, commentary, some documents but thats it really.  Not really a extras fan but 1 extra I would like to see in tv blurays or in Supernatural is the next episode preview clips they show after a episode, the trailers or other promos they use for each episode in a season.  I wouldnt mind paying a extra 10$ or a seperate bluray disc that has all the season episode trailers, promo, sneak preview clips for each episode for all of that particular season.  I would love to see that extra in future season sets.

Overall very happy with the show and glad 11 seasons wasn't the end.  Cant wait for season 12 or more Supernatural episodes.",1474502400,,2158,4.312655086848635

4501988,5,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural season 7 episode 14 of Plucky Pennywhistles  Magic Menagerie has the two brothers dealing with stopping a person who is murdering innocent parents using the drawings of their children.  Even scarier is the fact that one of the creatures responsible for the deaths is the last type of image most people would suspect.  My only caveat; The scriptwriter(s)/authors did a good job with outlining the motives of the person behind the sinister deeds. My only caveat is that the personality profile, from my view, fit the stereotype of the type of person capable of inflicting grave harm on others and the reason that the killer gave definitely does not garner  may not even garner a modicum of sympathy from the most compassionate of people ( or maybe that was their point). However, I understand that it is completely meant to just provide entertainment fiction.  However, I just wish that it was written in a way to where at least one of the brothers could have advised the killer on how he could have handled it. I know that I must be considerate of others who have not yet watched this episode. It is just that Im fortunate to know that your most formidable adversary/critic could be a multimillionaire executive trying to use their connections from preventing a person (their target) from moving on to a better opportunity. However, if a person has enough faith in themselves, as well as build themselves up spiritually to listen to their intuition/be in tune with their spirit. Then even that persons challenges and/or critics can help push them towards their dreams (even when that is the last thing that a particular critic/enemy/and/or rival is trying to do.  My point; I understand why the outcome had to unfold the way it did, but from an aspiring writers standpoint, I just wish that there could have been one of the brothers explaining that the spiritual power that the killer was using for dark could have been turned around to make a stronger comeback from either professional and/or personal adversity even if some of the most highly influential people (on a professional scale) would try to prevent and/or stop him from doing so (i.e in addition to the we are spirit beings having a human experience awareness). Aside from that caveat, this episode 14 titled Plucky Pennywhistles Magic Menagerie  from Supernatural Season 7 is engaging to watch.",1452729600,,2369,4.892768079800499

Season 6 is still pretty good. Solid episodes and an entertaining season.
Season 7 is okay. Not great, but had some moments worthwhile. The cliffhanger at the end of the season made me expect season 8 to be amazing..... I was wrong.

Essentially, it's a whole ""I'm half devil and half angel"" dichotomy BS that you would read in a 13-year-old girl's collection of terrible fantasy writings.  I mean, honestly, if it had just stuck to hunting monsters and the occasional demon, it would have been good.  Instead, it just seems like a really bad teenage fan fiction.

I heard that season 8 is good, but it's too late.  The series lost me.  I used to love this show, but it just became un-watchable after season 5.",1433462400,3,621,4.581818181818182

4502082,4,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural hits a few bumps along the season and grinds a few times as well.  The Leviathan thing, for instance.  Was this Supernatural jumping the shark?  It certainly could have been.  It seemed as though the writers got a little too fixated on one ""major"" storyline and didn't spend enough time having this show be what it was best, something different that never saw the same thing two episodes in a way.

My wife and I have been watching Supernatural in binge viewings.  Happily and sadly we are getting closer and closer to the end.  We want what made the show fun.  We liked seeing the different demons, critters and things that go bump in the night.  The addition of Castiel (Misha Collins), I originally thought, was going to be a bad thing.  I was wrong.  The addition of Crowley, well, the same thing.  Fortunately Mark A. Sheppard can really take this character and turn it from a write-in to an awesome reoccurring role.  Meg, Rachael Minor, however, well, she can go any time.

Supernatural is a fun program when they don't get blinders on and go just one direction.  The acting is great, the writing is a hoot and the characters are a laugh.  As a post script, auvoir Bobby (Jim Beaver).",1432512000,2,1204,4.582159624413146

In fact, Sam and Dean have both been to Hell and returned stronger than ever and even more intent on wiping evil from the face of the Earth and trying to stop the impending Apocalypse. Aided by Angel Casteel  and other hunters of evil, they keep on fighting and suffering. But as long as they have each other, the Brothers will continue to survive.

4502255,2,B004YM6JK0,"I didn't dislike the introduction of leviathans, but I did think it misplaced.  It just wasn't a perfect fit.  Unlike seasons 1 through 5, where there was a plan.  Season 6 was a bit disjointed, but there were still several great episodes.  Season 7 detoured in a way unanticipated, and I lost one of my favorite characters.

Jason Patrick Stewart/Dick Roman was just phenomenal.  Slick, conceited, savvy and totally evil, and he delivered his lines with such confident zest.  He could stand toe to toe with Crowley/Mark A. Shepphard; in fact, their interaction was a particular highlight.

Comedic relief was Castiel/Misha Collins.  I especially loved him trying to share his ziplock bag of honey with Crowley.

I liked the introduction of Kevin Tran/Osric Chau.

My favorite episodes were Slash Fiction and Reading is Fundamental.

But I didn't really care for the other episodes.",1417305600,,882,5.090909090909091

4502298,5,B004YM6JK0,"A volatile season of SUPERNATURAL if ever, there was one. In this Season 7 on 6 disc's in the form of 23 episodes, Sam - having gotten his soul back, once again fights along side Dean wholeheartedly as they face a new, unknown enemy, called Leviathans. Everything that they have learned thus far in extinguishing monsters, demons, vampires, evil ghosts and so on, is ineffective in dealing with these new creatures from Purgatory. Even Bobby is stumped, by what to do with them. But, through a series of events, when they do find out and begin to incorporate it against them, just before they get to the King Pin Leviathan Monster, Bobby takes a bullet to the head and dies a short time, later. Filled with justifiable rage at the injustice Sam and Dean fight back, gain access to and annihilate the Leviathan King Pin. But, with the usual price to pay with every huge kill, the explosive death of the Leviathan King, blew such a wide hole in the spiritual realm, that it sent Dean, flying into Purgatory along with all the other Leviathans. No way? Oh, yes way. Because everything is possible on SUPERNATURAL, yeah eh!:) Nina Kish",1412726400,,1131,4.66

The Leviathan were pretty creepy and the way Sam and Dean defeated ""Dick""(BEST use of the name for a villain EVER!)seemed, at best, kind of anti climatic, although it did lead to one of the best buddy movie storylines in Season 8. If you, like me have seen every season and want them all to watch again, season 8 is a must if JUST to find out what happened after the crazy ending of season 7.

This season is a lot of *d**k* jokes, seriously, the season is just a ton of them. You could skip this season, but everyone worked really hard on it, and I am sure there are some really great Key points for the next, Castiel's story in this one was interesting to me, I DID enjoy his story line in this season. So if you can deal with a bunch of stuff that doesn't seem like it needs to even be in the show so you can find out the few things that are important, get it if the price is right, otherwise just borrow it from a friend.",1401840000,,705,4.00709219858156

4502433,5,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural did something very clever about six seasons in (or so) - they did a ""restart"" wherein they seemed to revert back to the original mission (hunting demons and other monsters).

4502438,5,B004YM6JK0,"Love this show!  One of my favorites.  Jensen Ackles is such a talented and underused actor.  This season was under par compared to earlier seasons, mostly due to the Leviathan storyline that just didn't ever really work.  Also, they killed off (temporarily, of course) fan favorite Castiel for this season which most fans were not happy with.

The beginning of the season starts off mediocre (much like the following season), with a choppy flow to it and writing that just wasn't quite right.  However, as the season gets going, the pace gets back on track and even though certain story elements didn't work (the leviathan thing that they were stuck with, and the ""alcoholic Dean"" subplot that they thankfully ended up dropping... seriously, what WERE they thinking?) the acting as always saved the day.  If it wasn't for the talent of these two young actors (especially Ackles), this show wouldn't be as popular as it ever was even today.  And the season DOES get better towards the end, making me realize ""ah, yes, THAT'S why I watch this show"".  That is why I still gave this season 5 stars even though its definitely the worst season of the show, in my opinion.  Even at its worst, I still love it.",1392163200,,1203,4.685714285714286
4502439,2,B004YM6JK0,This is a much darker season than previous seasons. I think the writers have changed because they have lost their self deprecating humor and replaced it with moral terpitude. Not as enjoyable.,1392163200,,192,5.03125

4502468,3,B004YM6JK0,"I have been a fan of this TV series from their first season until now! Despite the other worldly situations in previous episodes, the actors & the story line made it somewhat believable, entertaining, & tackled some real relationship issues. I really didn't like about half the episodes of this season. The writing seemed poor and too comical in nature. I've always enjoyed the quick writs between Dean & Sam & sublime intermittent comedy of the series. However, this season the actors seemed to have problems trying to pull off the believable factor. Some of it seemed to be more of a spoof of the supernatural type! I would only recommend this season if your a die-hard fan and want to see the story line flow from season 6 to season 8.",1390089600,,738,4.598484848484849

It is my alltime favorite show ever and I would watch it from the time I get up until bed if there were enough seasons. I watch it on tv just about every morning,channel 37,TNT from 9am till noon when it goes off. I've watched it play through probably 8 or more times.

It's an amazing TV show and of course, who could not enjoy watching Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins, and Jared Padalecki? Not to mention the countless other characters. It's not even that, the show is constant action, folk lore, thrill, and mystery, with a touch of fantasy. This series is right up my alley, I love the odd shows. I was very scared this show wouldn't pick up and that I was gonna end up with two seasons of an unfinished series, I am so glad that that did not happen.

This show is great, in my opinion, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves an action drama.",1388793600,,707,4.438461538461539

4502486,5,B004YM6JK0,"In my opinion, is currently the best show on tv at the moment.  Action, adventure (of a sort), suspense with a good dose of humor.  Amazing acting by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki that can have you crying your heart out or laughing so hard you almost pee your pants (check out the episode 'Yellow Fever').  It's a shame this show hasn't gotten recognition from the Golden Globes or similar award shows because they definitely deserve it.",1388275200,,441,4.701298701298701

An immortal, powerful force decides to take over humanity through agriculture?  Really?  I love this show, and up until then, the baddies had all been somewhat believable.  But the Leviathans were just a joke.  Thankfully, the bro-chemistry between Sam and Dean was still there, at least.",1387065600,,439,4.958904109589041

Hard to think a show this successful would need to regain its identity, but that's exactly what I feel like was needed after the conclusion of season 5 and season 6.  This season begins to gain that traction or identity and propels the show to new heights moving forward.  Still a huge fan and still continuing to watch.",1386460800,,441,4.419753086419753

The inspired casting of Jewel Staite, James Marsters, Charisma Carpenter, and Felicia Day will make any Whedon fan giddy.  It was a strange, funny, quirky, emotional season . . . as usual.

I bought the other 6 seasons, 2 at a time on a weekly basis. Again, if you are going to purchase a TV series my advice is to buy where the bargains are and Amazon, so far is that vendor.

4502617,5,B004YM6JK0,"As any die-hard SUPERNATURAL fan will probably tell you, this was not their best season. BUT, that doesn't mean it's still not a great season ans still totally worth watching. It's still the best series out there.  Just make sure you watch previuos seasons first - I highly recommend starting at the beginning.
SUPERNATURAL has action, drama, mystery, intrigue, comedy (though it may be a bit twisted at times), family dynamics, great lead & supporting characters, an awesome car and even romance occasionally. It seems to have everything all wrapped up in one show.
There is no question among those who have watched SUPERNATURAL, it is an addicting show. That is why it won a coveted place on the cover on TV GUIDE - voted by the FANS (NOT Neilson rating or some other obscure rating system) as their favorite show - beating out top shows such as NCIS, THE MENTALIST & CSI.
Not sure if you want to get involved in a show with such an odd theme? You'd be surprised by the variety of people who get hooked on this show. Start with SEASON 1 and go from there. If a whole season seems like too much, I highly recommend theses episodes: (for humor) WISHFUL THINKING and YELLOW FEVER / (for drama) HEART and FAITH / (for family dynamics) ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE PART ONE & TWO.
If you make it through all the seasons - up to and especially including this one - hold on and have faith beacuse the show redeems itself. Thanks to great writing, directong, producing, special effects and all the wonderful things that make up this SUPERNATURAL - SEASON 8 starts off a bit unsure but wraps with quite a spectacular cliff hanger - making us more then anxious for the upcoming SEASON 9 (feared by most, icluding myslef - to be the last season).
Whether you love, hate or indiffrernt about SEANON 8 - as I stated earlier: no show compares to SUPERNATURAL. SUPERNATURAL on its worst days is still more creative, intense and all-around better then most of the t.v. shows that pass for programmimg nowadays.",1370908800,,1989,4.602816901408451

Series start with two boys, brothers whose characters and personalities emerge as you go through the episodes with them. Subtle nuances in the role are superbly handled by Jensen and Jared along with other cast members. Later seasons are deeper in meaning because the estranged brothers develop their relationship and pick up the pace as the storyline progresses.
Chemistry between the main actors which shows on-set or even during interviews is an incredible match to the story line, the on-screen brotherly ribbing, smart-assery, pranks, but also genuine caring and brotherly love shine through, which makes the series irresistible.",1370476800,,842,5.378787878787879

Supernatural makes you think about ""Good"" & ""Evil"" and what influences people to be one or the other. Also you have to really pay attention or you may loose the trend of the storyline.  It shows how complex relationships in ""FAMILY"" can be.  Finally it is just flat entertaining, and you do not get tired of it.  It has to be good to last for 9 seasons.  The fact that it has a multitued of interesting characters and constant twists and turns in the storyline ""hooks"" you and keeps you wanting more.  GREAT SERIES!",1364774400,,660,4.333333333333333

4502663,3,B004YM6JK0,"I hope my review conveys that while the series overall is an easy 5 stars, this season as a stand alone is far from it.

It starts off with a good idea from the last season which was also a bit lackluster.  All of the good elements of Supernatural return here with impending world doom, monster of the week episodes, and shallow but fun character development.

We also start off with a bang - leviathans!  I thought this was just going to be about the most awesome of all creatures.  Sure, they were tough and such, but I guess I expected more from them.  They seemed no different than a typical vampire or ghost in terms of running a situation.  Their master plan also wasn't too exciting... About the coolest thing these monsters had going was they had to eat themselves as punishment at times.  Also - if you thought the leviathans were introduced into the story quickly and with little thought, they left even faster.  They're all gone too - at least as far as I can tell with no mention of them ever again.

There are of course loses for the boys.  They must continue to carry on by themselves.  The boys will never truly have a home or any family except each other.  This part of the season was better I think and keeps up with the fact it's just Dean and Sam going it alone against the rest of the world.

The current season was partially set up by the 7th with the tablets that reveal awesome secrets about many of the main monster races.  This didn't need a whole season though as this concept was crudely inserted at the end.  It's a cool idea and we currently get to see it played out now with each monster having an ultimate kill switch or other things that can be used against them.

Overall - it's Supernatural and a lot of the series favorites are present in the 7th season.  I just found the bigger story of it disjointed and it could have been more of a sub-plot to a bigger season.",1362960000,,1899,4.301408450704225

4502689,5,B004YM6JK0,We discovered this series on Netflix. They had up to the sixth season available and it was going to be several months before the the seventh was going to be available. These actors make the characters likable even when their actions are questionable. I think it also helps that they have become as close to brothers in real life.,1361059200,,329,4.593220338983051
4502690,3,B004YM6JK0,"I have loved this show since it's first season and still watch it because I love the dynamic between Padalecki and Ackles as the Winchester brothers.  With that said this is not a favorite season.  If you love the show and need your fix of the WInchesters then yes this is a season you will want.  However, the writers need to include more ghosts and Wendigos and shapeshifters in their seasons.  I am getting a little tired of the angels and demons crap.  Plus they need to find a way to bring back Bobby.  They did with Castiel.",1361059200,2,530,4.357142857142857

4502702,5,B004YM6JK0,"What can I say the Winchester boys never disappoint.  This show is on it's 8th year and it is still going strong.  Amazing and unique story lines.  Great action keeps you coming back for more. What I love about this show is that it has all the elements you are looking for in a great show -it's action packed but can be sad, dramatic or humorous. They execute some of the funniest lines that make you hit rewind so you can laugh even harder.  The actors who play Dean and Sam have great chemistry. You really believe they are brothers with all their bickering and bantering but most of all on how they protect each other.  This show is so good even the Villians are endearing like Benny the Vampire. You find yourself rooting for him to survive. I recommend this show to anyone who likes to watch shows with supernatural story lines.  You will not be disappointed.",1360368000,,864,4.436708860759493

4502706,5,B004YM6JK0,"Sam and Dean just keep saving the world by the skin of their teeth while fighting the world' s most creative and thorny monsters.
This season takes you walking on a tight rope over the bastions of hell and the promises of an out of reach heaven, presenting creatures that look at man, as just one Big ""Super Sized"" meal. The theme of the Dante's Inferno with worldly warnings and the Angels and Demons fight for man, keep resurfacing in a funny and satirical way.
The characters and plots are refreshingly unique, campy at times , but also thought provoking.
What more can you ask of a team of demon fighting brothers? They are entertaining, comical and generally leave you
with a message of hope about a world that is totally lost.",1360022400,,732,4.553030303030303

The mental break of Sam and then Castiel at Lucifer's hand. The return of Jo. Time travel and vengeful gods. Dick and his monster playmates. A fallen angel and the leader of fallen men. A tablet reading prophet and a demon nurse. Sammy all alone while Dean and Castiel are transported to Purgatory. This is a can't miss season full of drama, laughs, action, mystery, sorrow, pain, tears, betrayal, hope, faith, brotherhood, family and friendship.

4502736,5,B004YM6JK0,"I love Supernatural! I've watched this show since it's pilot episode and have never missed an episode on TV.  I love the show so much that when the dvd set comes out, I buy it so I can watch it whenever I want and see the extras. I find the mix of humor, drama, and horror to be  entertaining and though the series doesn't take itself terribly serious (a lot is tongue in cheek), the series manages to keep the story line entertaining and fresh.  The main actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, are not just pretty faces; they're great in the roles of Sam and Dean Winchester.  They breathe life into characters who could easily become charicatures of themselves.  Plus, Jim Beaver as Bobby Singer and Misha Collins as Castiel are always a treat!  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone and some people have said that Supernatural is stale but I'm not one of them. I hope they continue making the quality show for as long as possible!  If you're a fan of the show and you want to see some extras not seen on TV, then owning the series on dvd is a must! I own them all and I've never regretted purchasing them.",1357862400,,1111,4.3125

4502747,5,B004YM6JK0,"Season 7 of Supernatural has some of the best scenes with Dean and Sam. They continue their battle with demons, Lucifer and with themselves as they struggle with their quilt about life and work choices.",1357344000,,202,4.8
4502748,5,B004YM6JK0,"There are bound to be fans who disagree with this reviewer's disappointment with season six as season seven got the show back on track.  There is so much Castiel (Misha Collins) that one can stand and the seventh season's introduction of the Leviathan was a breath of fresh air, especially in the casting of James Patrick Stuart as ""Dick Roman,"" a force to be reckoned with.  This season also saw the departure of a cast member but it was well-handled, befitting the status of the character to the Supernatural mythology.

As always, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are their usual superb selves, still needing to be recognized by the Emmy folks. Fans of the show will have to be content that they know real talent when they see it even when the nominating folks just don't get it.  Mark Shepard's frequent appearances as Crowley are also a pleasure to watch.  The season also boasts some great guest appearances by James Marsters and Charisma Carpenter (""Shut Up, Dr. Phil) and ""The X-Files"" Nicholas Lea (""Time after Time"").

Speaking of the latter episode, one of the special features deals with the composing of the music for the landmark episode: an episode that has Dean working with Eliot Ness of ""The Untouchables"" fame.  This extra is quite informative about scoring and how essential it is to the overall production of  the series.

This is an excellent season and whets the appetite for the succeeding ones, of which the series will, no doubt, continue for years to come as long as its production/writing values remain the same.",1357344000,,1541,4.828897338403042
4502749,5,B004YM6JK0,"A wonderful combining of the past, with the present.  While not everyone from the series is present in this season, it stills brings things into focus of the past-the current-and the future(?)-or not...if things don't work out.  A very enjoyable fantasy based series, about 2 somewhat average joes...and how they came into being.",1357344000,,329,5.188679245283019

When ""Supernatural"" arrived on the scene on the then ""WB"" I sat ""riveted""  to my TV.  Jensen and Jared's Chemestry brings ""believeability"" to the show as Brothers. Their ""Life"" has captivated me....You know you love the show when you ""DVR"" the episodes on TNT, you have all the seasons in their boxed set, and you just went and purchased ALL of the boxed Season's on Blu-ray.

4502837,5,B004YM6JK0,"The first thing we have to say is that this season is slightly tricky. The previous ended on the take-over of the cosmos by a social-climbing angel, Castiel, who had eliminated all the archangels that could oppose him and had managed to fool Crowley and he had his last final words demanding everyone to get on their knees and obey their new God. That was drastic, that was horrible, that was un-human. And that couldn't last long.

And it did not last long because Castiel, like all these angelic people do, always forgets that God always puts something evil in the middle of anything good. They forget about the apple. Everything was good in that Garden of Eden, except for a snake, an apple tree and an apple, though it probably was a fig tree and a fig. So why should Purgatory be different? And it was not. Actually Purgatory was invented to put away one complete failure of the creative power of God, that is to say his first living creature created for the vast water expanse that existed before he started creating his playthings. And that creature was Leviathan. Note God is never able to destroy his failures, to repair his mistakes. He can only hide them away, generally under the carpet. His husbandry is absolutely primitive.

So Castiel opened the gates of Purgatory and swallowed all the millions of souls there, which made him super powerful, powerful enough to finish up the last archangel and to take over the whole universe, but he had forgotten he had also swallowed Leviathan who waited for its time and moment to come and then without any more ado decided to take over this strange angelic body-vessel in which it was trapped and then to manage that dumb ass of an angel into freeing him and for him to get the upper hand on the planet. Simple Dr Watson, simple, a real child's play. And that poor Castiel will have to repent for ever for his crimes and his dumbness.

The dark black Leviathan was created in water before light even existed, by the way it is not in the first chapter of Genesis but later in the Old Testament coming up on the Biblical soup like the bad monster Anzu that had taken all waters prisoner in the Zoroastrian and Sumerian tradition some two or three thousand years before the Bible. So that monster is as black as night and it rots Castiel from the inside. Castiel turns black and starts feeling the call of the deep ocean and Castiel manages to obey, willy nilly, more nilly than willy, and he goes down into a lake and liberates Leviathan in the water that gets into all the pipes of the city and maybe beyond since that lake was a drinking water reserve. Dean and Sam can satisfy their sadness by picking Castiel trench-coat from the lake and keep it as a keepsake. But one thing is sure Death refuses to intervene. It is the responsibility of those who released that monstrosity to get rid of it, and hurry up that must be done by the end of this season.

I am of course not going to follow the episodes. You have to work a little bit. Now the worst and most monstrous creature of God has been released onto the world we can go back to business as usual and run after various monsters of all types. For example an old  acquaintance of Sam's, when he was a young teenager and was more or less ten or something. He was starting to experiment with girls but he has never been very lucky with this female subspecies of the human species. He gets that from his mother I guess. This girl who is now a woman was already what she still is, a brain-sucker sucking brains directly from the live skulls of a living humans, at least if possible for the last part. But Sam is in love again and he remembers how he was nearly the victim of her mother and that it is this girl who killed the mother at the crucial moment of the brain ""surgery"". So when he discovers she has a son and it is for him that she killed he gets soft and accepts her promise never to kill again. He let her go. But Dean disagrees and what will happen? The punch line is fantastic and the punch hatred from Sam is enormous, though it will come later.

You will like how Sam and Dean get in-between a married couple of ancient witches who have been living through centuries. But they love each pother so much that they are bored of love everyday and they set some mustard on their daily bread and start accusing each other of treachery and unfaithfulness, etc. And they start creating havoc in the place for fun and entertainment. But Dean is a genius and manages to bring them back together and Sam is a darling for all suffering sentimental creatures and he helps them by instinct. But if it were that simple it would not be funny. So in the end Sam and Dean are no longer the saviors but the potential victims of some curse that has to be smoothened up by their friends the witches, or is it only one? But which one is it?

The dear Leviathan, the master of them all, is able to mutiply and the baby can enter any body they want, what's more the body becomes like a snake skin and they can change their looks on demand, back and forth. They are shape-shifters by profession, affiliation and confession. And what about if two of them were assuming the bodies, the looks and appearance, language and everything going along with these bodies of Dean and Sam? Embarrassing since these two clones could lead the police to them committing all kinds of crimes and that would be very embarrassing indeed. But luckily there is always a way out of a trap, provided you have the proper tools. And a little help from your friends. And it is Bobby, in his new lair, since his old Bobby's Salvage Yard has been torched down by the Leviathan or maybe some other demons, who finds how to destroy these Leviathan, at least the lower layers of them. Using a simple product anyone can find in a proper kitchen. And cut their heads off, but keep the head trapped away from the body otherwise it will go back onto its body.

They will of course spend some time saving some mentalists from some vengeance coming from some lured customers. That will enable you to see under the table of the mentalist, and all her tools to make you believe your grandmother is taking a bath in the garden's bird-bath

Dean and Sam will also settle some accounts with the old Becky from the time of the pulp book serial and the first Prophet. She has always been a fan of Sam. Her Internet identity is Samlicker81, Sam is a licker, She wants to lick Sam, She wants to drink Sam's liquor and all that playing billiards with two holes and one cue, a real trouble shooter cue, and the number of balls can vary I guess from two to nine. And on the Internet she is responsible of a Wincest site meaning she believes Dean and Sam are ""morethantbrothers"" and yet she wants to marry Sam. So she has to drug him, with a devilish elixir she gets from a devil of her friends' and she will be surprised she has not been able to consummate anything, though she has to tie Sam up on the bed for him not to escape and she cannot even then manage to consummate. Funny, funny, funny, but tricky like hell to get Sam out of this rape story.

But the best things cannot last for ever and in the fight against the main Leviathan, a certain Dick Roman, a multibillionaire who has been invaded by Leviathan who is trying to use the money of this personality to create a food empire that will transform humanity into game for hunting and various pleasures in the west part of the USA, cattle in the south and part of the Mississippi valley and laboratory testing animals to research and develop the perfect drugs to produce the three categories of human chattel they need. They find out that the master Leviathan and some around him are not really killed by the kitchen product we have already spoken of. Luckily for the suspense otherwise it would have been too simple. Unluckily Bobby gets shot by the master Leviathan and is at the door of death hesitating and trying to come back. In the end that battle cannot be won, except two minutes to give the ""boys"" a number code they will have to understand. And then he dies. At least that's what you are supposed to believe.

They will then use a substitute, Frank or something like that, for Bobby whose number they find in Bobby's agenda or address book.

By accident Dean attacks a certain God Chronos, the God of time who is some kind of vampire who kills to suck the red soul out of hid victims and thus be eternal. But he has the power to travel in time and Dean finds himself in 1944 with Elliot Ness mind you chasing after a monster that Dean has to bring back along with himself to the precise time and place where Sam is waiting. Complicated but funny and the trick is so simple after all. It is always very simple but they make it look as if you needed to have a 250 IQ to invent it. So all will be well and end well, as we knew it would, but after a lot of angst and suspense.

The best encounter though is that with the tribe of the Amazons. Dean who is always easy on the female side of the world gets trapped by one. An Amazon gets pregnant instantly, delivers within 36 hours (in the film it is more like six hours) and the child at the end of the day will be a teenager and the following day a young woman. Of course these Amazons only deliver women, un-naturally. But the daughter has to do something before becoming a full-fledged member of the tribe: kill her father and cut his two hands and his two feet off while alive and then cut out the sign of the tribe in his chest while he is still conscious and losing his blood. That's what children are after all, nothing but giant bloodsuckers biting after the blood of their parents.

We discover in the mean time Sam is afraid of clowns and yet a whole shebang of crimes happen in a daycare center for children entirely organized around and with clowns. Sam and these clowns are having a good time indeed. And yet the pervert who kills what and who the children draw is found out not to be a clown, far from it. Poor chap. How can one be that deranged! But luckily Dean and Sam are the guardian angels of the children.

And the past is never very far away. A serial killer exorcised by Dean and Sam in the past is back to recapture his demon. How selfish and ungrateful some deranged people and perverts can be! You cannot trust anyone any more and the poor chap you help along the road turns into a biting venomous snake in no time when he feels comfy and warm on your chest.

And you will find a small antique store full of mysteries and ancient objects that kill and make other people kill. That's a little bit a clich from Dickens redressed in modern colors. I think too this one is quite close to Stephen King's ""Needful Things.""

A new development appears at this moment that is going to make Sam completely crazy. Lucifer, who is locked up in his cage with Michael in the body-vessel of Adam, the half brother of Dean and Sam, has the power to get into Sam's mind and make him believe he is still down there, and then when this is solved he starts torturing him by preventing him from sleeping by all means. Guantanamo revisited, though he shouts ""Good Morning Vietnam"" all the time which seems to be coming from another film about the Vietnam War. I guess you all see which one. The one with a US military forces' radio anchorman to entertain the combat troops down there in Vietnam. This revisiting the past brings a new discovery. Castiel has lost his memory and is living like a nice husband with his girlfriend. Dean will have to drag him into curing Sam, which he can't do, but he can something else that liberates Sam of some kind of green demon. Dean and Sam are accused of having scratched the wall built a long time ago by Death and some angels between Sam's soul and his memory of Hell. That's why Lucifer can come up from the cesspool.

Now and then they can use the help of a young hunter of Bobby's and Franck's stable, a certain Garth. But nothing very brilliant. Just entertainment. To exorcize a spirit you can only see when drunk is tricky. Frank's hideout has been attacked by the Leviathans and his hard drive has been stolen by Dick Roman. But there is a girl at his headquarters who can help break it and she can also help Dean and Sam. She cracks the hard drive but pretends to Dick Roman that there is nothing concerning Dean and Sam, the only thing Dick Roman is interested in. But on the side she manages to copy and export the whole hard drive of Dick Roman himself. Note he has memorized his pass code to enter his computer. Must some monsters be so proud and sure, vain and silly to believe their security is so good that they need not fear anyone?

The last big development is the appearance of the ""word of God"", an engraved stone that Dick Roman wants, that Dean and Sam steal and have transcribed by the ""Prophet"" that comes all by himself on his own unconscious drive that he has to go and to go to the stone. That gives the recipe to get rid of master Leviathan which will get rid of all his clones. But Dick Roman manages to capture the Prophet and have the stone translated again under duress (the Prophet's mother is kidnapped and Dick Roman blackmails the Prophet, by the way a certain Tran, probably Vietnamese). Dean and Sam need several ingredients to make a powerful weapon against Leviathan. The blood of an Alpha, and there is only one left, an Alpha vampire, but also the blood of Crowley who is of course in-between Dean and Sam on one side and Dick Roman on the other. Dick Roman actually trust Crowley. At least Dean and Sam never do that mistake.

The season ends up dramatically. The confrontation with Dick Roman will end up with the destruction of the master Leviathan, but his death sends Castiel and Dean back to where he Leviathan came from, Purgatory where all kinds of monsters are roaming. Good Morning Vietnam indeed. Sam is all alone at Dick Roman's headquarters that are under some menace to explode or self destroy. And just before this confrontation Dean and Sam has burned Bobby's silver flask to which he was attached and that Dean was using all the time. So Bobby is gone for good this time. And the Prophet Tran was taken away before the final destruction of the master Leviathan to a place no one knows.

Suspense, suspense.

This season though has left angels and archangels aside (easy for the latter since they are all dead except Michael who is in Hell with Lucifer). We are no longer dealing with a dominantly Biblical saga since Leviathan is not typically Biblical, far from it. The demons are plain demons, ghosts are plain ghosts, witches are plain witches. But at the same time we have lost a unifying thread that really keeps all episodes together. It has become looser in a way.

On the other hand it has also become more socio-political. It denounces with maybe too much weight the danger of a consumer's society and the weapon that corn syrup represents against our health and well being. It also goes back to H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"" saga in which the human race is transformed in pure chattel but with three main categories: game, cattle and lab-testing animals. The Morlocks are just as dark and horrible, but the Eloi are not all meek and passive and have been differentiated into three different types, slightly like in Brave New World where they are five from alpha to epsilon. That's a come-back which is maybe slightly schematic but that's the TV genre of the series that requires that schematic texture. No time to play too much on the psychology of the characters and of the masses.

I will have to wait for the next season till October or so. Too bad. But Il will have plenty of time to suspend my pleasure.

Basically two brothers (Sam and Dean) run around the country busting supernatural creatures butts. You'd think it would get old but it doesn't really as each new episode adds a twist and all are very well written. As with all TV shows the characters are a bit inconsistent from season to season as far as I can tell but not so much as to draw attention to the fact.

4502871,5,B004YM6JK0,"Honestly i just love this show to death, but this season brought back the beginnings by hunting ghosts and whatnot, not just worrying over ""lucifer"" and the apocalypse which was nice :D Other than Sam's increasingly terrible hair, the show was as excellent as the previous ones and I fully recommend it, and all previous seasons of course, to everyone",1353283200,,351,4.866666666666666

4502877,4,B004YM6JK0,"It is hard to imagine, SUPERNATURAL is currently in it's 8th season on television.  Wow.  Time flies.

Well, I am happy to say, Season Seven...  IS TERRIFIC.  Following the catastrophic events of the previous year, the boys are back to battle their season long villians...  LEVIATHAN's.

Most series seem to lose steam as they get older, SUPERNATURAL picks up steam.  It has lost none of it's appeal.  The stories are still innovative and imaginative.  The direction is always first class.  The tech credits a superb.  But, the big attraction to the series is the fantastic chemistry of the Winchester brothers, Sam and Dean.  As played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, they are terrific together.  They make the viewer believe they really are brothers.  Add to this a series of recurring characters played by Jim Beaver, Mark Sheppard and Julian Richings.

The season starts off with a bang...  and ends in spectacular fashion, beautifully setting up what is showing on television now.

Treat yourself and watch the show (from the beginning)...  It is great!",1352678400,,1064,5.011494252873563

And, since I am 56 years old from when I was in elementary school and starting watching Dark Shadows, I have been hooked on anything to do with the Supernatural.  Jensen and Jason are get together and it is not hard to believe that they are not brothers in real life.  To the writers of this show keep the plots still making one wonder what will happen next.  And, to Team Dean and Sammy, keep up with the suspense.  I Love This Show!!!",1351728000,,540,4.144230769230769

4502896,5,B004YM6JK0,What can I say?  Just that Dean & Sammy Winchester are kicking all kinds of evil butts and looking handsome as usual while doing it.  Never a dull moment and always entertaining.  The best series about supernatural things.,1351123200,,222,4.7894736842105265
4502897,5,B004YM6JK0,"The brothers Winchester continue their difficult trek through life, death, heaven and hell, with and without Bobby, Castiel, and others.  There are still some funny bits here and there, like the drug-induced wedding of superfan Becky to Sam, too; this helps to balance out the darker parts.  And watch Jensen Ackles sing ""All out of love."" Classic!",1351123200,,348,5.087719298245614

I love the winchester boys, they remind me of my sons!",1351123200,,300,4.375
4502899,5,B004YM6JK0,This season was one of my favorites. I loved how the Asian prophet was kinda goofy. And the Leviathans were a great addition to the series. I hope Sam ans Dean continue to be bad asses and continue to kick monster ass!,1351123200,,218,4.214285714285714
4502900,5,B004YM6JK0,"I would have to say that I am on the boat of SPN fans who are not overly fond of this season. However, it is still thoroughly enjoyable. The worst thing you can do is to compare it to the first seasons (which I think set the bar too high). But, Leviathans and all, this is a good season. And hey, you can't go wrong with this show so long as Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are still in the lead. They really hold the show together, though there are still a lot of amazing side characters (Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel, to name a few favorites). If you love this show and own seasons 1-6, then you're obligated to get Season 7. It's worth it, I promise. And if you were like me and cringing with each episode as it premiered on TV, they are much better a second time around when your expectations aren't so high.

As far as the product itself, I am happy as usual. The cover design is a little better than the somewhat odd photoshopped picture on Season 6, and the packaging is simply pleasing on the eyes. It has a gag reel (as it should!) as well as some deleted scenes for some episodes and a fun outtake of Jensen singing an alternate version of Air Supply's ""All Out Of Love."" Friggin' hilarious and makes the entire collection even more worth it. However, it was missing one thing that I was sure would be included in the DVD. There was a joke outtake posted by the CW some months before the release of the DVD of a scene from ""The Mentalists"" where Sam (Jared) is doing his exercises and such in a hilarious way while continuing the serious dialogue, and Jensen all the while miraculously keeping a straight face. I loved it so much, but I haven't found it on the DVD. If it's there, then I stand corrected.",1351036800,,1715,4.276923076923077

4502912,5,B004YM6JK0,"When Season 6 ended and I heard they were going to make another one, I thought, ""OK, this way they can give it a final ending and tie everything up.""  After Season 6 I thought it was time.  They'd pretty much explored everything there was to explore.  The story line was, I thought, getting tired.  Then Season 7 arrived and now I'm on bended knee praying there will be many, many more seasons.  I mourned the loss of Cas and then I mourned the loss of Bobby.  But then they came back!  Not sure how much more we'll see of Cas, and he was an absolute favorite character, but one can hope. I am also missing the car, but we see some other good old muscle cars.  We also see them drive some that make you go ""Really?""

I like the Leviathan characters and most especially like that they aren't the mainstay of every episode.  It keeps every episode fresh and interesting.

I also see a tremendous leap in the acting abilities of Jensen Ackles.  I always thought Jared Padalecki had more flexibility in his skills, playing the tender equally as well as he played the fiery.  This year I'm seeing a much wider range in Jensen.  He nearly brought me to tears in the episode where Jo's ghost came back.

We haven't reached the final episode yet and I have to tell you I'm approaching it with anticipation and dismay.  Anticipation because every episode to this point has been fantastic.  Much on par with the first four seasons.  Dismay because, well, it's ending!

But they are now showing the 8th season and we can only hope there will be many more to come.",1350777600,,1552,4.401408450704225

4502918,5,B004YM6JK0,I am a HUGE fan of supernatural. This season was in my opinion a lot better then the season previous. It goes back to hunting the monsters like they used to in the beginning.

4502930,5,B004YM6JK0,"I noticed alot of people complained about this season and was surprised!  I thought this season was very good, it was packed with action but still had the drama with the brothers, and the cliffhanger at the end of the season really surprised me.  I would have liked to see more of Castiel but hopefully he will appeear more in Season 8, cant wait!!",1350259200,,348,4.421875
4502931,5,B004YM6JK0,I heard a lot of complaints about how this season stacked up with the previous ones. Granted it wasn't the best season but it was by no means a bad season. A couple times I was left wanting more and it seemed like plot devices were added that didn't make sense for the sake of making it interesting. But overall still a good season. The main baddies this time around left something to be desired however. As dangerous as they were hyped to be I never felt that from the actually story lines. Although I will admit these were a very different type of monster then what the brother were used to. More cunning and stealthy and organised. Still watching the show and excited about season 8.,1350172800,,686,4.409448818897638

4502935,5,B004YM6JK0,"At first I was really mad with this season for not having enough of Castiel's character in it and then with Bobby dying.  For me it was as bad as when Sirius died in Harry Potter 5.  But then after I bought the season and watched it once, I realized that it is really good, and like always has many excellent episodes.  It made me look forward to season eight completely!  I wish to god that more people watched this show because while there are fantastic european actors in this show, this show is really a display of good American acting and writing.  Especially since right now, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood don't hold a candle to the acting ability in this show.  And to be honest, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood out there don't even hold a candle physically to many of the actors in this show.  Jensen and Jared are overwhelmingly talented as well as handsome in a good old fashioned 'manly' way.  They don't look effiminate, or metro, which seems to be haunting the beauty standards of the 'average' male actor these days.  Misha Collins is also very SEXY in that ""I actually look like a deep and complex guy"" way and Jim Beaver is the type of man who you wish your husband looked like when he's in his forties. Crowley's character is also very well acted, along with many of the other ensemble or guest starring actors/actresses.  This is a well done show!  And this is not coming from a overtly critical but hypocritical person. i tried acting and I couldn't do it good to save my life, just like many people who claim to be famous and talented in hollywood are: NOT TALENTED, and don't have the looks to make up for it!  But this show is not the case.  This is a show where there is a synthesis of loads of talent, beauty, good direction, and thought.

I wish this show was on the tip off everyone's tongues as opposed to other supposed film 'phenomenons' out there right now that don't deserve the hype they get.

4502936,2,B004YM6JK0,"i love supernatural. The best season is a tie in my book between the second and third. Those two are almost flawless. This season on the other hand... Lets do this another way. A couple of quick likes. What i liked. There are a few great episodes worth seeing, going back in time to meet samuel colt and the ghost housestands out. The leviathan were an interesting new monster for the guys. Getting away from played out angel/demon stories as best they could. (can't get rid of them completely its pretty much part of the show)... Thats about it on the likes. What i didn't like... I don't have the time so I'll boil it down... WRITERS. i know you guys are in hollywood and i expect these on occassion but the nonstop shots at conservatives and their beliefs were endless... it's a show about 2 guys hunting monsters, okay...  leave your politics at home. The repetitive D*ck jokes really this is your best effort. (You can and have written hilarious stuff this is not it). After six solid seasons this one is kind of a big step back. To keep this short and sum up. FANS:  this season isn't completely horrible but i suggest you borrow this season or wait until its on sale. And since i directed my criticisms at the WRITERS(if you guys actually were to read this) a couple of suggestions. Don't end anymore seasons with someone dying or being banished and how about a season fighting the Cthulhu mythos creatures. Elder Gods, cults, fishmen and tentacled things from the outer darkness. That would be great.",1349827200,3,1508,4.5814814814814815

4502944,4,B004YM6JK0,"""Supernatural"" turned into the Little Engine That Could--the series appeared on a small network, had a small following initially and has blossomed into a cult hit. The first five seasons were terrific with a series of season long story arcs and a larger one that, had it ended with season five, would have made for a satisfying series (although some fans might not have been happy with Sam's fate originally).

Season six which started with the return from Hell of Sam who was missing his soul  stumbled a bit as the series creator Eric Kripke left the show and the series searched for a new direction. The seventh season is more satisfying and more consistent than season six reaching close to the high points and their fight in the pit during seasons one through five.

SPOILERS:

Sam's looney tunes--he's lost his mind, or rather, his soul has been damaged from his possession by Satan in the pit. What's more Castiel in his battle with the other angels in Heaven for supremecy takes a dangerous path--making a deal with the Crowley. He's also absorbed the souls in Purgatory--the only problem is that he's also absorbed God's first creations--the Leviathans-- creatures that were so offensive to God that he banished them. At first Castiel BELIEVES he is now God but quickly discovers that he can't handle the souls of the Leviathans who escape and decide to make humanity into their version of Soylent Green. Dean, Sam and Bobby are the only ones who can stop them and, without Castiel, they quickly find themselves on the losing end of this battle.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray for ""Supernatural"" looks marvelous. Blacks are as rich and gooey as the blood of the Leviathans. Colors looks quite nice and the show which always looked like grainy  film even though it is shot digitally and detail remains strong throughout. The AVC encode helps each episode look top notch.

The lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice directional effects used throughout the series.

The special features are quite good as well. We get three commentary tracks including ""Slash Fiction"" with our stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles who are their usual charming, chatty, funny selves.

We also get the ""Supernatural Creature Fest Drive-In"" which has a number of terrific featurettes covering how the writers came up with the story arc for the seventh season, ""Highway to Death"" that compares what one of our characters sees when they die (as compared to what we've heard and read about in literature), ""Prosthetic Men"" focuses on the make up/creature effects and ""Trail of the Winchesters"" tells us everything we did (and didn't) want to know about Osiris.

We also get ""Doppleganger's Ball"", ""Weekend at Lily Dale"" which focuses on the episode ""The Mentalists"" and what inspired the episode. ""Creatures from the Digital Realm"" shows us how the creatures were created for the season. We also get another episode of ""Jensen Sings"" as well as the season gag reel.

There are a couple of Easter eggs in ""Supernaturla Creature Fest Drive-In"". Have fun hatching them as you watch the special features.

The seventh season of ""Supernatural"" improves on the shakey sixth season and although the show quality dips a bit with the loss of a major character, it quickly picks up again.

Recommended.",1349222400,2,3281,4.931034482758621
4502945,4,B004YM6JK0,"Originally conceived to have a 5 year arc this series is still around in its eighth season. Although it began life as a buddy buddy brother roadtrip kind of show as the years have gone on it has become darker and more philosophical. Dean and Sam are beer swilling junk food gulping good old boys. Although they  rarely remove their shirts to show off, how they maintain those trim physiques given their diet and lifestyle is one of the show's mysteries along with the other imponderables: how they race around the countryside without getting any speeding tickets, fake all those FBI Passes and rarely get caught using them, keep hiding that arsenal of weapons, afford and maintain those immaculately pressed suits they wear when impersonating the FBI. Most at home in denim and plaid despite sleeping in those clothes in that speeding car they never seem to look rumpled or sweaty. At 6' 4' Sam does not buy those jeans off the rack. In one episode last Season Sam was shown shirtless performing a workout worthy of any bodybuilder.

Given the sibling rivalry shown on screen one wonders what Jensen Ackles thinks of Jared Padalecki getting top billing in the show's credits. Although Dean is the older brother on screen and in real life having him call Sam who towers over him his little brother is amusing. Both grew up in Texas a state where guns are a way of life. The violence and gore factor belie the fact that this show is more popular with women than men. As the series budget increased with its popularity the creatures and special effects become more sophisticated.

I thought the season began weakly but it improved as it progressed. Getting hooked on a series such as this is not about believing the preposterous storylines because they're so outrageous they defy suspension of disbelief. This is about becoming attached to Sam and Dean and wanting to see how they get themselves out of their latest scrape. In the end their situation is hopeless and its resolution would spell the end of the series.",1349222400,2,2013,4.7457142857142856

I do like the new villain the leviathans, but the formula that made past seasons so great seemed missing.  There was very little funny mixed in with the drama, and I think tat upset me the most.  You could usually count on at least 2 funny episodes in each season to balance out the dark drama.  This season is was mostly Dean drinking a lot while depressed, and Sam adopting a sunny outlook because as he said, it can't get any worse.  And worst of all, they brought back evil clowns.  WHY!

#1 Awesome picture. #2 Great Sound. #3 Wonderful not having to leave the show or movie to get to the main menu (most of the time if you do select a feature, the show/movie will stop, play the feature, and best of all, will return you back to the point where you left off! BluRay has so much to offer, I could not put them all in this review...trust me, you won't be sorry!!! Back to Supernatural, what great things can I say, that have not already been said....If you are thinking about purchasing this series, I say go for it, give it a try! You will enjoy it! Caution, start from the first series, and go from there, the payoffs are great!

So after watching season 6 I don't even have to watch season 7 to know I am going to be very disappointed and I hear talk about a season 10? oh no they simply cannot turn this show into power rangers 100/yugioh zexal/pokemon season 1000 <all shows that should have been ended.

4502968,5,B004YM6JK0,"This is one of the best shows currently running for a couple of reasons:

1. It is a well blended entertainment.
(The characters are intelligent and have senses of humor, which allows them to lighten the tension, when needed, with a well placed quip, which also lets the audience know the characters are reacting to what's going on in pretty much the same way the viewer is. Great for pulling the audience even further into the story. But it is not, in any sense, self-parody. When the scary strikes, you take it seriously.)
2. It never falls back on Scotty to save the day.
(One thing that weakened the otherwise brilliant Star Trek series was that, after having gotten trapped in some dire situation and struggled through 80% of the episode trying to deal with it, in the last few minutes Scotty would always come up with some techno-babble based solution to the danger by routing the impulse engines through the tractor beam or whatever. Once, okay, I buy it. But do it every week and it merely becomes a plot resolution convenience that is expected, totally ruining any tension. Supernatural never depends on some convenient or coincidental solution to the problem. And the tension remains high due to the fact that they've already killed off major, continuing characters... Dad, Bobby, Rufus, Ellen, Jo, etc. etc. Every life is up for grabs each episode which makes it nail biting week after week.)

If you've never watched this program, try the first few episodes of season one. If it doesn't grab your interest, then it isn't for you. But if it does, make room on your DVD shelf for the entire series, because this is a show you can watch over and over again and still enjoy.",1346803200,,1682,4.679054054054054

4502974,1,B004YM6JK0,"As all Supernatural Fans will agree seasons 1-5 were superb! Although not perfect and plagued with plot holes was done well and is a shining example of quality television. Season 6 wasn't bad, the Eve storyline was nice as a sub-plot the real plot, control of the ""Souls"" for the war in heaven. The actual ""Soul"" plot had nasty plot holes but was ambitious and should have been both season 6 and 7, it could have been that good. Instead season 6 felt rushed, especially at the very end when in fact ALL of season six, at least Sam and Deans involvement in it (and Death's help) was to prevent the baddies of season 7 from getting freed.... Death thought it important enough to ask Dean to ""keep digging"",,,, these Leviathans must be some bad @$$ baddies.... Instead we're treated to sub par villains with petty shallow ambitions and desires and a plan that in fact Death should have thought a funny joke, NOT help Sam and Dean....

All in all season 7 was a larger waste that season 6. As bad as season 6 was it's still could be considered a gold standard when compared to season 7. Unfortunately they're going to do a season 8, when it should've ended at season 5 but it is what it is. I don't want to blame Sara Gamble for the shoddy seasons but I guess who else can I blame so since she's gone I can't help but hope for a better season and also for an ending of the show, hopefully on a good note. Then and maybe then we can look back on season 7 with some sense of assisting season 8 end what was once a GREAT show....

PS: Sadly I will be buying season 7,,,, just to keep the collection in tact. I know I shouldn't give Sara Gamble the pleasure of it but the show gave me such good fond TV moments, some of the best ever that I feel I owe em that much....

I loved the characters of Donald and Maggie Stark and this felt like an old time Supernatural episode with lots of lighthearted humor.  But like a previous reviewer remarked, it makes absolutely no sense that the brothers would let two immortal witches go who have both killed several people in just this episode alone but Dean kills Amy who saved Sam's life??

Jo Harvelle is called to the witness stand, and after somehow avoiding confessing to the death of Amy in the last episode, Dean is found guilty and it is up to Sam to save him before Jo's ghost gets to him.

We are introduced to Amy, and get to see how she met Sam when they were both young.  I thought that the flashbacks were the best part of this episode as it gives us a glimpse of Sam's life while Dean and his father are off hunting.

First, Dean's actions took me completely by surprise!  I understand why he did what he did, but certainly they have let worse monsters/baddies live - the warlock and witch for example who killed a few people got live because he saved their lives.  Amy saved Sam's life and still Dean kills her and keeps it from Sam.  It didn't seem in keeping with Dean's character or what the brothers have done in the past.

All of that aside, I agree that some of the episodes have little to nothing to do with each other.  In previous seasons there was always an episode or two where the brothers go off on several hunting trips that don't relate to the mains story arc but this is all beginning to feel a little disjointed... like a puzzle where someone is forcing the pieces together.

It gets 5 stars, however, because it was a great performance by Dean and Sam, and the flashbacks were wonderful!",1343520000,,1258,4.3418803418803416

They are both injured at taken to the hospital where the Leviathans have created a base, and Sam continues to struggle with visions of Lucifer.

I thought that this was a suspenseful episode despite not liking the animated Leviathans.  They remind me of typical TV monsters, slimy with a lots of teeth and nothing unique about them.  We are also left to wonder if Bobby made it out alive.  I'm actually beginning to miss the cursed objects, ghosts, and demons that the boys normally hunt.",1343520000,,1014,4.787356321839081

Their plans go awry as always but not before Death reveals the existence of Leviathans who previously occupied Purgatory.  The ending was not what I expected for a first episode and I couldn't wait to see Episode Two to find out about Castiel's fate as the Leviathans overpowered him.  Sam is also struggling because he can now see Lucifer everywhere due to the wall in his head crumbling.

I suppose my biggest question - and one that never gets answered - is why exactly Dean is ready to kill Castiel.  While he did betray the brothers, they don't attempt to 'fix him' as Dean did with Sam who committed some of the same crimes as Castiel while drinking demon blood or when he was soulless Sam.

Some of the things that made this show enjoyable for me were not really present this season.  I most disliked the fact that almost all of the regular characters are dead or seldom seen.  While Bobby is involved in a different way I would hate for them to pull a Sam and Dean and bring him back (I'm trying not to spoil the plot!).  It would certainly be the easy way out of this.  I also missed the Impala and while this new breed of monsters was ok, I couldn't quite understand that all the other creatures were MIA.

The brothers go through many gut-wrenching events this season, and Castiel is as amazing as ever!  The Castiel storyline was probably my favorite this season!

I will purchase this season to watch all the episodes back to back because it was very hard to follow the story because there were big gaps of several weeks before the CW would show a new episode.",1342310400,2,1070,4.446153846153846

4502993,5,B004YM6JK0,"I have been an avid follower of Supernatural since season one. As such, I have seen the show's two main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester, face creatures ranging from demons to witches, from vampires to werewolves, from wraiths to tricksters, from roogaroos to angels, and SO much more. Needless to say, you would think with a show like this, especially one where the writers will only pull from legends that already exist, things would get old quickly. However, Supernatural has been running for seven seasons now, and each one has presented something new and exciting for viewers. This particular season presented a whole new breed of monster: the leviathon. And these monsters brought with them an entirely different set of rules.

I must admit that while there were a lot of things to love about this season, including the new monsters, the classic monster-of-the-week episodes a la seasons 1 & 2, the brotherly bonding moments between Sam and Dean, and the classic Supernatural humor that fans have come to know and love, there were also a few things to dislike about this season. The main two things that I had issues with this season were the loss of beloved characters and the fact that the leviathons' constant hunt for the boys drive them to ditch the Impala for the vast majority of the season.

Still, in spite of these two drawbacks, the show still managed to pull off another great season. And like they have always managed to do, they ended the season with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. And I'm personally hoping that the ""more"" I get with season 8 rectifies my few issues with season 7 by bringing back our lost characters and reinstating the Impala to its rightful role: an appearance in EVERY episode!",1339977600,56,1735,4.79933110367893

Now that I'm caught up to Season 7, I'm trying to figure out what episodes I've already seen.

4502995,5,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural fans have had it better than most for quite some time. After a rocky first season, Supernatural season 2 set the tone for the rest of the series: a powerful force with personal ties to the Winchesters that has to be dealt with is a formula that has spawned the series most successful seasons. Unfortunately, some fans feel that this blueprint should never change and because of that feel that this season was lacking. I am here to disagree.

I have loved every season of Supernatural, but as the seasons passed I started to miss the lighter episodes that showcase why the boys are the best in the business; namely the monster of the week cases. The boys having to overcome personal struggles and stop the apocalypse is fantastic, but sometimes it gets too heavy. Season 7 did a nearly flawless job of combining the two.

The constant threat of the Leviathan mencace was handled well without becoming over bearing. Sam and Dean still have to save the world, but also show their versatility as hunters. They take on everything from age old witches and ancient Egyptian dieties, to killer clowns and spirits that can only be seen while drunk. There are also plenty of heavier episodes with them dealing with the nearly unstoppable leviathans, creating a satifsfying balance.

Season 2 still ranks as my favorite season, but this set is easily my second favorite. Season 7 is an entertaining, well balnaced season that has something for all fans. There doesn't have to be an apocalypse every season for it to be good, and season 7 proves that.",1339459200,18,1552,4.762081784386617

4503001,5,B004YM6JK0,"I don't think Supernatural has fans. I think Supernatural has fanatics. The word ""fan"" implies that those who watch this show are passive. That they look forward to that one hour a week where they can escape and watch these boys fight what overwhelming ""big bad"" they are facing, turn off the TV set and then go about their daily lives. ""Fanatic"" is far more fitting for the followers of this show. We are obsessed. We read spoilers, we go to conventions, we write fan fiction, guess at plotlines, and emotionally invest in characters to the point where they become our family. This show has been on the air for SEVEN years and over those years there has been so much character and plot development that it has definitely paid off to be a fan. It is clear that the writers are smart because the consistently deliver succinct and intelligent writing and continue to move the show forward in a clear and sweeping development through Heaven and Hell, and now even Purgatory. The actors are talented, and can consistently deliver humor and heartbreak with rough raw emotion that makes the show feel realistic even if there are supernatural elements that could not happen in the real world.

A lot of people have complained about the last couple years, but I think Dean says it all in Season 4's ""The Monster at the End of this Book""-""For fans they sure do complain a lot"" People like to whine and complain about the last couple of seasons but at the end of the day if they aren't watching then they don't have anything to complain about and if they can complain about the plotlines of the seasons that they supposedly hate then they're still watching!

Each year there is a new surprise and new drama and new humor and the new greatness. I can't wait for Season 8 and all of the whiners will just have to continue to whine and I will continue to toss them up to representing the human condition. The show is constantly trying to out do itself, but in a realistic transition from it's own past, which is incredibly rare in a series and should be respected greatly.

Even after 7 years of being on the air, I continue to be invested in the characters and curious to how it will all turn out, not many long-running shows have the ability to keep you on the edge of your feet with perfect writing and a past that they are so aware of.

4503003,4,B004YM6JK0,"Everyone seems to give Sera Gamble crap for the show's perceived ""decline"" once she took over as showrunner.  Gamble has been with 'Supernatural' from the beginning, and is responsible for writing some of the series' strongest episodes.  I agree that 'Supernatural' could have ended with the conclusion of its fifth season, but it didn't.  When shows age, they show signs of wear and tear.  As years go on, some seasons are weaker than others.  Look at 'Desperate Housewives,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' or any 'CSI' or 'Law and Order' show for the proof.  Blaming Sera Gamble is weak, and if Eric Kripke were still in charge people would be blaming him.  The show isn't as fresh because there's nothing fresh about it.  The actors and crew have been together for so long they're all family now.  Everyone is so overwhelmingly familiar with one another that the sense of newness and adventure seems to be gone.  I will say the show has lost the edge it once had but I still enjoy coming back week after week.

I will say I was slightly disappointed with the season finale.  Am I the only one who thought it anti-climatic?  Also, I hope that Bobby is gone.  I love the character and the actor, but I hope the show does not fall prey to bringing him back just because he's a beloved recurring character.  Let him go.  His death and his ghost finally moving on should give the boys a renewed edge.  Bobby was one of my all-time favorite characters on this series, but nothing about the finale or the burning of the flask gave any poignancy to his death.  The show is usually better at handling the deaths of beloved recurring characters ... i.e. John Winchester, Ellen and Jo ...",1338076800,2,1667,4.593220338983051

I highly doubt anyone is going to buy this who hasn't watched the rest, so this review is for fans of the show. And to them I'd say ""buy this season. If you have loved the rest you will love this"".

4503007,4,B004YM6JK0,"There are some SPOILERS ahead.

Supernatural has struggled with the leviathan storyline this season giving us many filler episodes and then writing a lot of plot into the last three episodes of the season. The Season 7 finale opens with Crowley in a devil's trap of Dick Roman's devising, negotiating for his release, the country of Canada and the vial of blood that Sam and Dean need for the leviathan weapon. The potential for double, triple and quadruple crosses exists but there is little real tension as we don't expect Crowley to double-cross Sam and Dean. The threat of the leviathan is too great.

Bobby continues to possess the hapless hotel maid, but finally comes to be at peace. In a pair of scenes that set up Season 8, the lead leviathan in the form of Dick Roman is dispatched but Sam is left to take care of the others...by himself as Cas and Dean have disappeared secondary to the killing of Dick and Crowley has taken Kevin Tran, the prophet for some nefarious purpose of his own. We find in the last scene that Dean and Cas are trapped in Purgatory and then Cas deserts Dean.

I am on-board for Season 8 as long as Sam gets rid of the leviathan quickly and the storyline in Purgatory is interesting. I also have hopes that the new prophet and Crowley and the alpha vampire will make things interesting. These are all potentially great plot points - it just remains to be seen whether the writers exploit them properly or not. All in all an entertaining and promising end to a middling season.

4503012,5,B004YM6JK0,"Fans haven't liked the leviathon arc. This episode gives a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been. The ancient tablets gave Sam and Dean the information they need to make a weapon that will defeat the leviathan, but a weapon is one thing, victory another. For this weapon, among other things, they need the blood of an angel, the blood of a demon and the blood of an alpha vampire. Bobby has some ideas regarding tactics and strategy as well, but the boys are more and more worried that Bobby will become a vengeful spirit and are taking less and less heed of what he has to say. Kevin Tran is still being held hostage, as is his mother and his role as prophet could be an interesting addition.

In this episode, Sam and Dean set out to get the ingredients for the weapon. Plot concentration is on the alpha vampire who holds a young girl hostage and has since she was eight years old. The blood of virgins is pure you see. The alpha vampire is on the side of the leviathons, but they may be about to double-cross him. This plot line, the alliance between the vampires and the leviathon could have been used over several episodes and could have made the leviathon arc much more interesting. So too could have been the development of a weapon to right them. Once again, Sam and Dean are forced to make questionable alliances - this could have been explored more fully. So, a good episode, but ultimately a bit of a tease as many of the solutions to the leviathon scourge strike the viewer as magical rather than earned - and they could easily have been earned, making this an outstanding season of Supernatural rather than a fair season. Recommended to fans for the improvement, but not the place to start for new viewers.",1336780800,6,1726,4.496815286624204
4503013,4,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural is moving toward the conclusion of Season 7 and the defeat of the Leviathon. In this episode, the tablet that Sam and Dean found last week turns out to be the writings of Metatron, an in case of emergency note, as the newly awakened prophet, Kevin Tran, informs Sam and Dean. Poor Kevin, he is an honor student preparing his college applications and obsessing over his SAT scores when the latent prophet within him is awoken by Sam and Dean. It seems that Castiel is awakened by the tablet too as are various angels, demons and leviathon.

The episode sets up the ultimate defeat of the leviathon and telegraphs a possible way in which Bobby will play his part. The leviathon storyline has been mishandled in many ways, set up as an invincible enemy and then left to sit for weeks at a time narratively speaking and then the means of defeat fall into their hands. Even the cliffhanger that ends the episode leaves the viewer a little unmoved. I am a long-time Supernatural fan and am quite forgiving but can only rate this episode as fair to good. I did like the character of Kevin but feel that introducing him earlier and having him and the boys work harder to discover the means of defeating the Leviathon might have made for better story-telling rather than giving it in a few wrap-up episodes.

4503016,5,B004YM6JK0,"Fans and long-time followers of the Supernatural franchise haven't been fond of the Leviathan storyline, but this episode makes it work. The Leviathan is genuinely creepy, the Bobby storyline continues to have both grace and grit and the story of the week works, especially with Felicia Day guest starring as a hacker.

Charlie is a computer expert working for Roman Enterprises. She is everything a nerd dreams of and then the Eye of Sauron lights on her and she is handed Frank's harddrive to hack by none other than Dick Roman himself. Sam and Dean are alerted that someone is attempting to hack the hard drive and the trio joins forces. And by the end of the episode, Sam and Dean pick up a little something that may help them defeat the Leviathan. I just hope it is more convincing that a monster that falls to old-fashioned cleaning products. All in all a great episode. I didn't check the writing credits, but the last few episodes have had the feeling of early Supernatural. Great for the fans.",1335830400,,1002,4.661016949152542

We follow Sammy, Dean, and their monster killing entourage through another 45 minutes of supernatural adventures.

It may be another season or two. As long as they don't kill off a main character!

Don't get me wrong Misha's a great actor but I watch the show for Sam and Dean and was happy about every portion of the episode, I thought it was done very VERY well.",1335312000,,529,4.217821782178218

I'm glad he learned how to move things but really! This could've been an awesome way emphasize being a ghost but they lost that. I was watching it, thinking, go through the freakin' wall, you idiot.

4503021,5,B004YM6JK0,"This season has been some good and some bad but not much great.  This episode, the real return of Bobby I would rate unamong the great.  I thought that they didn't do justice to Castiel's return and I wasn hoping that they would do better by Bobby and they did.  I also liked Annie as a character and I wish we had seen more of her earlier in the series.  I was a little puzzled by Dean's final reaction; so I hope they flush character development out some in future episodes.  I also hope that Bobby stays around long enough to get revenge on Dick Roman for that shot to the head.  I really want Castiel and Lucifer back too but I doubt that they will bring back both of them.  I could care less about this new Meg.  Here's looking forward to season eight of Supernatural my favorite show.",1334966400,,790,4.22
4503022,5,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural has had its ups and downs in recent seasons both in stand-alone episodes and in longer arcs. Of Grave Importance does well on both fronts and reminds viewers why they loved Supernatural in the first place.

Bobby is dead. We last saw him about to make the final decision about whether to go with his Reaper or not and as we haven't seen him since, both we and Sam and Dean assume that he did go with his Reaper. Think again. Meanwhile, another hunter is investigating a haunted house where teenagers keep going missing. She calls Sam and Dean and arranges to meet to return some things of Bobby's. She never shows up. The episode follows the nasty haunting and Bobby's attempts to get in contact with the boys. It seems that ghosts have to learn their trade the same as anyone else.

Well-written, well acted and interesting, this is a classic episode of Supernatural and sets the stage for more drama to come between Bobby and the boys. Recommended to all fans of Supernatural.",1334966400,,991,4.625

This 80's baby was so pleased I watched it twice! A task I usually reserve for high info exposition episodes. This was a real treat in the middle of a highly depressing season 7. Between the 'unbeatable' Leviathan (can't help thinking of Peter Weller every time they say it) and a dead Bobby Singer I didn't know if I would want to stay tuned, but this light ep pulled me back in for sure.",1334707200,,561,4.564356435643564
4503024,5,B004YM6JK0,I absolutely loved season 7 just as much as the earlier ones.  I am like the others.

4503027,4,B004YM6JK0,"I feel as though some reviewers on this page missed some under tones in this ep.
Dean is obviously worried about Sam. And I think some of what he does has to do with protecting his little brother. Saving him from having to kill a friend.
Also, you must consider his own pain at losing Lisa and Ben. Honestly, when I saw the kid I thought Dean was going to kill him too. But instead he tells him to stay on the non-homicidal straight and narrow. Proving that while he may be troubled, Dean is forever the self-sacrificing protector.",1333411200,,531,4.373737373737374

4503029,4,B004YM6JK0,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this was the best Supernatural episode in a while. This season just doesn't seem to be coming together, even with the shock of Bobby's death. However, the actor who plays Lucifer has always been delightfully creepy and it is a pleasure to see him. As other noted, Cas is back, though ignorant of who and what he is. All in all a good episode.

Now for the season overall: I have been a Supernatural fan for a long time and I would hate to see the boys go but feel that the writers have been struggling to find their way ever since the apocalypse that wasn't. This isn't to say there haven't been good episodes and seasons, there have been, but the show never entirely recovered from that mis-step. This season has no arc to tie to together and the stand-alones have either been done or you wish they hadn't bothered. This episode was good because of the acting and because the plot was connected to several previous plots and to characters the audience loves to watch.",1333152000,,1014,4.451612903225806
4503030,5,B004YM6JK0,"As a long time watcher of this show, from the very first episode, I have to say that even though it's not a very strong season, it is still fun, interesting and a show well worth watching.  I personally love the fact that they are not afraid to get rid of long standing characters like Bobby and Cas.  I had mixed feelings about the last episode where Cas takes Sam's place, but Cas as an angel did the ultimate sacrifice for his friends.  It's not that Sam and Dean don't need him anymore, and yes I do feel Cas will be back in the future, it's just they have to grow and move on, as things do in real life.  Also, with Meg working there, she'll find a way to get Cas back because she has it in for Crowley and Satan.  That alone has me certain that the old Cas will be back to help Sam and Dean in the end.

This show mixes it up, and they did big time once Kripke left.  I like this season more than season 6, but both seasons have its big ups and downs.  I loved some of the characters and am sad to see Bobby, kind of like Sam and Dean, that felt like losing my Dad... Cas, an old good friend even Baltesar, I loved his character and like many characters in Supernatural, you may see them again.  Remember, it's called Supernatural...anything can happen.

I like how both characters have grown, but stayed the same.  The current producers and writers have Sam and Dean true to themselves.  Anyone whose watched this show from the beginning will agree, sure they've grown up, but they are still the same too.  Now that takes a lot of talent and work to create characters that grow and stay the same for 7 years.

I disagree with what one review said about `weak' characters.  I love Frank!  He's such a cranky old guy, like their grandpa just giving them, well mostly Dean crap.  I liked the witches from earlier in the season.  Played by Charisma Carpenter and James Marsters from Buffy the Vampire.  Those two were a riot and I hope we see them again!!  And the Leviathans themselves.  The actor playing Dick Roman is scary and reminds me of a presidential candidate.  I do wonder if that was intentional???  And Mark Pellegrino as Satan... wonderful actor and character!

The only thing I don't like about this season, is the missing Impala... they even used a few rock names in the last few episodes, but still no return of the car...  bummed, in the same breath, I am enjoying some of the classic muscle cars they've been driving since.  All a little beat up compared to the Impala,  as if to say not as loved, but still again, Sam and Dean true to their roots.

I like the return of monster of the week, like the old days.  I also like that they are blaming some of these monsters on the leviathans.  Speaking of them, I find them one of the most interesting monsters ever on TV.  I have never heard of them, but yes I do know of purgatory.  Another reason the angel and demon story is not dead on this serious.  Purgatory is not heaven or hell... but God created it according to the bible. I don't know a lot about them, but it makes me wonder how they will be defeated as only Sam and Dean can of course.  This show takes from lore and does its research.  It's a very intelligent show with good writers, has been from the beginning.  Yet has a sense of humor which is what I think most of the fans really enjoy.

With a few episodes left it will be interesting see what they do with these new villains.  I do smell a season 8.  What else does CW have?  Secret circle??  Ugh!",1332806400,5,3486,4.245053272450533

4503032,5,B004YM6JK0,"This season has taken a nose-dive for the most part, which has been really disappointing for me as a hard-core, die-hard Supernatural fan since season one. The infrequency of episodes this season has been killer. So far, the storyline has been randomly meandering all over the spectrum, from big bad Leviathans to a bore of an episode entirely on cast-off cursed objects. So far the writers have blundered through, all without really developing the story. When they killed off both Cass AND Bobby, it really lost vital character elements. I say fire whoever has been shipwrecking this season, and let whomever took the wheel on this episode take over!!! Sad as it is to say, this sub-par episode has been one of the better ones for this season. Sam manages to save a fellow (hot) female patient, even while in a Lucifer-driven state of insanity. Dean searches for a mysterious healer to help Sam, instead discovering his once-best friend and one-time greatest betrayor: the fallen angel Castiel. Throw in the demon Meg, some amnesia, and a re-entry of demon intervention, and you've got the best supernatural episode in weeks.",1332633600,,1126,4.962962962962963

The other time travel episodes seemed to be more poignant to the over arching plot but this was the general ""hunt bad thing"" episode. This is the sort of thing you get when you try to pull a time travel plot line one time too many. The conclusion (how Dean got home) seemed very deus ex machina.",1329696000,,509,4.247422680412371

4503037,1,B004YM6JK0,"First let me say, I absolutely love Supernatural. One of my favorite TV shows out there. However, the 6th and 7th season are TERRIBLE! My wife and I keep trying to watch it when it comes on TV, but we end up turning it off everytime because it's literally like the writer/producer are sitting around naming off every cheesy thing that could possibly happen and going ""Yeah, that would be hilarious! It's so dumb!"" and then they put it in the show. It's ridiculous.

You lose your favorite characters, Bobby and Cas, and they replace it with a bucket load of bad animation and a ridiculous story. Every once and a while Sam and Dean's ability to click with each other comes through (which made the show in the first place) and gives you a smile, but other than that it's not even worth watching.

Once he gets captured the young girl insists on accompanying Dean to rescue her father and Sam. In the B story, Frank and Dean follow Bobby's numbers (actually coordinates) to a piece of land owned by the leviathans and try and figure out what the land is going to be used for. At the end of the episode, it is the young girl that saves three big, strong male hunters from a fate worse than death. Like I said, not my favorite episode.

The demon (wonderfully played by Jason Dohring/Ringers/Moonlight) turns out to be the god of time.

Not so with Supernatural where the only dark moment was the beginning of Season 6 when Dean was busy trying to be a middle class white guy in suburbia. (So not you, Dean) Season 7 continues the saga while upping the stakes for the guys yet again. I miss Castiel, but not that much since the storyline he was such an integral part of has resolved--at least to some degree for now. You never know and that's the best thing about Supernatural, it combines common elements with fresh surprises every episode. Season 7 also sort of brings the regular cast back to their original roots of simply chasing monsters while staying one step ahead of their enemies.

In this episode, we get more back story on Bobby Singer as Jim Beaver gives a stellar performance. In a coma and running from a Reaper with his former partner Rufus in tow to help him navigate his memories, we learn about young Bobby's life and how it impacted his choices in his adult life. By the end of the episode we do not know if he lives or dies, but we know that the best memories in life are in the small little things we enjoy every day.",1322956800,4,570,4.238532110091743

I have been hooked on Supernatural for quite a while, but have been dissapointed with recent episodes. They should have not taken Casiel out of the series. He made the earlier episodes much more interesting. The newer characters seem to come and go to fast except for Bobby. I don't like paying for each new episode and am getting more dissapointed with this series, but thats the writers fault.

4503061,3,B004YM6JK0,"Season 7 is a mix. Some of the episodes have been great. But the show is losing direction. It seems like it is winding down. The of the most important characters -- Bobby and Cass -- have been missing from the last few episodes. Also, some of the production elements that made the show unique -- the rock and roll track, Dean's car and the dark filming -- have been dropped. Now the show is filmed in bright colors, and Dean is driving a baby blue car. This has changed the entire texture of the show. The show also seems empty without Bobby. I'm not sure why they keep bringing back Crawley. If anything, Cass should return.",1321574400,,625,4.35042735042735

It had a lot of old-school elements of Supernatural that long term fans would recognise; ghosts, grave digging, salting and burning, the EMF meter, grisly deaths. It also had a lot of heart as through their investigation of the case Dean and Sam sorted through some of their own issue.

An excellent episode continuing the brilliant run of eps so far in season 7.",1321401600,,396,4.739130434782608

I highly recommend this, and all the s7 episodes.",1321142400,2,352,4.603174603174603
4503064,4,B004YM6JK0,"Supernatural is my favorite television show and by no means do I mean to put it down in any way. However, for the record, I would just like potential viewers who have not been to Lilydale, to know that none of this was actually shot in Lilydale, nor was it an accurate portrayal of it.

Yes, there were some similarities, so, I can see that whoever wrote this either did their homework or visited Lilydale at one time. Yes, there is a cafe, which is a bit smaller and not quite as upscale as the one presented here. And yes, there is a museum, which actually looks quite similar to the one in this episode.
The biggest disappointment though, was the beginning scene, which showed Dean walking down a somewhat busy or populated street with signs hanging out in front of each shop. Lilydale is actually a small country type of town, with small country streets and houses the size of cottages, with only small wooden sign posts stuck in the ground in each front lawn with the person's name and talent written on them. No big signs or big streets here. Every porch has chairs, a table and notebook, for you to write your name down on it for an available reading time, unless you have an appointment, which can sometimes be made in advance online via email or phone.

I don't know why I was excited to read about this episode, believing it would actually be shot in Lilydale because they never are really shoot in any of the places it says in the show. I learned that from the Dogs who turn into people episode, which was suppose to take place in Buffalo, NY, where I live, but it didn't. So, I should have known they wouldn't actually travel to Lilydale for this show, which would have been very cool. So, those interested in visiting Lilydale, please don't be let down by this episode.

Also, this show portrayed Lilydale to be a community of fakes and dishonest people. While one person I have seen in Lilydale, left me somewhat skeptical, the rest were right on. The discussion of the Fox sisters was for the most part, the truth, but with different photos. But, even the psychics were aren't 100% accurate, aren't as obviously phony as this representation portrayed.

This episode in itself was a great show like always. I just don't like the misrepresentation of Lilydale. I have been there many times and it looks and feels nothing like it was portrayed in this episode. Nor are most of the psychics and mediums fakes, like you are led to believe in this show. I once saw an amazing medium in lilydale, named Gretchen Clark. She has been in People magazine, interviewed on television and more. The information she gave me about my mom, was information no one could have known but my mother. Additionally, she mentioned about 10 dead relatives I've never met, which my father did verify as relatives. And no, I never ever gave her my last name or any other information.

 Honestly, for a show titled, ""Supernatural"" you would think they would be a bit more open-minded about Psychics. It's easier to believe in Vampire's, Satan,and little dead boys in lakes than a psychic, really? I can't tell anyone what to believe or not believe, but I can say that my experiences in visiting Lilydale have been honorable. I love Supernatural, but, this was a poor portrayal of what Lilydale is really like. The show in itself, was very entertaining though, as always. So, those of you interested in Lilydale, please do your own homework and formulate an opinion of it based on something other than this episode. Still my favorite show though.",1320537600,3,3531,4.605723370429253
4503065,5,B004YM6JK0,"This episode is packed full of some of the best, darkly humorous dialogue of the entire series. The scene in the diner where Sam and Dean's evil clones are complaining about their real-life counterparts is a tongue-in-cheek tour de force. And that's just one little scene of an excellent blend of horror, dark comedy, action, love (a little!) and human emotional drama; this episode's got it all! In a two part scene, first with evil-clone Dean and then with the real Dean, the other shoe finally drops about Dean killing Sam's nice-monster friend so now the boys can fight about it and then deal with it. In my opinion a great, classic Supernatural episode.",1320192000,,658,4.780701754385965

An episode that is aired directly after the last two episodes to be like this one doesn't make a lot of sense to me right now. Sam and Dean never give up on anything, they've brought each other back from the dead, they stopped the apocalypse, and Dean kills Sam's friend from the past because of what she is and what she has done. They meet two witches that have killed numerous people, but for some reason they will let them go? Just like that?

4503070,5,B004YM6JK0,"This episode grew on me; it did not go as I anticipated. I expected Osiris, a god of judgement, to be stern and forbidding. Instead he had a dark, quirky sense of humor, maybe from a few millenium of watching the absurdities of humanity. He was in fact almost playful, although in a sinister way like a cat with a mouse. His mood was entertainingly unexpected, and it was a nice counterpart to the heavy-duty emphasis on Dean's guilt. But also a nice development of the theme of how Dean always faces up to the dirty work he thinks must be done, even though he feels bad later, and how he shoulders responsibility for the dark aspects of all of their lives.",1319414400,,657,4.39344262295082

I'm not real happy with what Dean did at the end either, as it felt a little... off, like he wouldn't have done this before the Apocalypse. It's possible that with everything that's happened at this point, he doesn't want to take any more chances. A decent episode and a nice peek into the early years of hunting, but not one of the best.",1318723200,,627,4.277310924369748

We all feel guilty about something at some point in our lives, but I think the question is whether we can learn from our mistakes and move on in order to seek redemption, to make amends for past sins.

No smooth transitions from one episode to another and jumps all over the place from one episode to the other. Simply stated the writers no longer have any continuity and seem to have run out of ideas. To much ""What's wrong with you, and what'wrong with me"" Keep the two Brothers, Bobby and CASIEL involved and the brothers working more together and not in conflict with each other.

Stick more to the present. This episode was way to FAR fetched! Stick with God and Angels vs Evil more in the present.

4503084,4,B004YM6JK0,"So I have been watching the show since day ONE and I have to say the character development arc has been pretty freaking amazing. Between both brothers going to Hell and back LITERALLY, I shouldn't be surprised that maybe Dean has finally reached a limit, but still this episode caught me a little bit ""off"". He always seems to find a balance between necessary actions of a hunter and not losing himself completely to the Life I guess. So, Dean's actions in this episode struck me as a bit heartless, but I can see how after all he has been through he might be getting a bit worn out of keeping the faith and being strong; after all these years, between losing his Dad, the Apocalypse, then finding and losing Samuel, saving his parents a couple of different times, then going through everything with Lisa and Ben, now worrying about Sam and the situation with Castiel ... well, I just have NO idea what's going to happen!
Dean has always managed to pull everyone together but just the first few episodes of this new season and as the ""big brother"" he has already been through a LOT!!

4503087,4,B004YM6JK0,"I've watched the first episode a couple of times now and I must say that this is a good start out of the gate. I've always loved the opening segments, ""the road so far"". It gives an overall picture of where ""the boys"" have been on this weird and wonderful journey. The wall in Sam's mind is now gone, he's having odd feelings that something is near him, but he can't quite get a grip on seeing it. Dean has no idea that his brother is having hallucinations, until Death spills the beans. Dean, Sam and Bobby try to figure out how to derail Castiel's god complex without killing him in the process. It seems that Death has an answer for that question too. There's a neat little plot twist concerning Cas that I didn't see coming.
All in all, I thought the premiere of the seventh season set us off at a good pace with lots of directions to travel in. The Impala is off and running...again!!!",1317081600,6,890,4.303571428571429
