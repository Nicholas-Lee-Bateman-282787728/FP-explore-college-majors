6429821,5,B00KI5SH02,"A huge 'thank you' to Mondo Macabro for finding this rare bit of Italo ero-weirdness and making it available in a great package.  I initially became aware of this film waaay back in the late 60's, when it was first released, via some 'production promo stills' in a men's magazine. The pix included several hot fetish images of pony girl action and whipping scenes with (for the day) remarkably high production values and great looking women. It was noted in the article that the film was Italian and it was entitled: ""The Slave"" - that was the last I ever saw or heard of it back then and over the succeeding years I had searched the internet in vain looking for any trace of it - now: ""hallelujah!"" Mondo Macabro has 'found it' and given it a 1st class presentation!

As is explained in the detailed extras included on both of the DVD & Bluray formatted disks - this film was made by the prolific Italian Writer/Director; Pasquale Festa Campanile - based upon a best selling erotic book of the day entitled ""Check To The Queen"" (in Europe) & ""The Slave"" (in N. America). The plot follows the story of a beautiful, bored, young, aristocratic woman with masochistic tendencies who becomes the willing servant/slave of a wealthy actress/mistress and the kinky games that they get up to, and where it all leads. Whereas the source novel followed in the footsteps of previously published  Euro erotic S/M tales, such as ""The Story of O"" and ""L'Image' - the film: 'The Slave'  pre-dated (by nearly a decade!) many like cinematic eroductions, such as, French director Just Jaekin's (1970's) movie  versions of ""The Story of O"", and the (John Willie B&D comics inspired) 'Perils of Gwendeline"" - both of which contained similar fetish elements. Perhaps director Campanile was a bit ahead of his time with the transgressive BDSM content of his film - it apparently flopped at the domestic (Italian) box office, was never given a theatrical release in N. America, and faded quickly into obscurity - engendering the, previously noted, difficulty in finding any reference or access to it.

While somewhat 'quaint', by today's standards, in the 'perverse' sexual realm -  ""The Slave"" provides a very satisfactory viewing experience on multiple levels. Both of the principal actresses are gorgeous and Haydee Politoff (as Silvia, 'the slave') spends a fair portion of the film minus clothing and/or sporting 'outrageous' 60's style fashions or fetish garb. The sets are over the top 60's pop inspired masterpieces and there's even an amazing mechanical horse that has to be seen to be believed.  The musical score is also xlnt classic Italo-schmaltz.  The scenes of harnessed pony girls and chained whipping that I carried so long in my memory are to be found in several 'fantasy/dream' sequences within the story - ironically they are given a sort of fuzzy-lensed treatment and are not as clear as the 'printed' production stills I had seen - yet itz great to finally see them in 'context'. The film IS rich in fetish imagery! - but - may not be considered as particularly 'erotic' in its' presentation of those elements from our somewhat 'jaded' modern perspective.

Ultimately ""The Slave' succeeds primarily as a slice of 60's pop culture - combining fashion, fetish, and flesh into an amalgam that is visually very satisfying - even if the 'story' is a bit nebulous in its' conclusions.  I really enjoyed it.  The print quality (for regular DVD format) is excellent - Italian lang. w/ English subs - widescreen letterbox - and there are some great 'extras' ( in English!) with 2 informative interviews and interactive cast bios.

Apparently a 'limited edition' of only 3500 copes - grab one qwik B4 it vanishes again!",1411171200,19,3708,4.875993640699523

8659177,4,B00KI5SH02,"I'm not sure I understand the low average rating for this film. I thought it was a stunning work of art. No, it's not your typical exploitation film, it actually goes a lot deeper than that. If you're just watching this for nudity, there is some of that, but The Slave is more psychological than titillating. I would imagine that people who are deeply involved in B&D and S&M would enjoy this film for its realistic, though artful, depiction of a young woman who longs to be subservient, degraded, dominated. This movie has a lot of extravagant sets and costumes and is a wonderful example of late 60s/early 70s Italian filmmaking from the director who later made the exploitation cult classic, Hitch-Hike.",1464220800,,706,4.795081967213115
8659178,1,B00KI5SH02,"Pretentious arthouse nudity about a countess who wafts through the life of leisure all the while secretly wanting to be submissive and dominated.

8659179,1,B00KI5SH02,"Dear Mondo Macabro you have published a wonderful ignored movie in such beautiful look why have you ruined it all with forced subtitles? If you can not yet in 2015 for whatever reason bring out a bluray with optional subtitles is better do not even release the product. It's such a shame to waste the video with not removable text. I've bought Valerie and her week of wonders I don't speak Czech and I have to read the english subtitles but I'm really glad that Criterion have made subtitles optional. Plus the title The Slave is very ugly the original Scacco alla Regina (Check to the Queen) is so beautiful. There is not any deleted scenes but maybe I'm not really good to look for it.

The vote is for Mondo Macabro, the movie is 5/5.",1447459200,,737,4.419117647058823

8659181,2,B00KI5SH02,"I bought this when it first came out and was surprisingly disappointed. There are many films that I like that aren't very explicit, but I bought this particular film for exploitation, and it just didn't deliver. I also just couldn't get involved in the film because I found it to be tedious and uninteresting, even though it has good acting and directing. The story involves a woman who travels to a mansion and becomes a slave there. The scenery, inside and outside the place, is nice, but I didn't think anything interesting happens throughout the film. With the films title and the description on the back claiming it has shocking images, I was expecting something worth mentioning to happen when she becomes this slave; however, she doesn't really do much. One of the highlights of the film is just when she gets painted and poses as a topless statue for some guests; this should give you an idea that there's nothing that she does that is worth mentioning. Various topless scenes are in the film, as well as a little bit of rear nudity, but it contains no explicit sex or full frontal scenes. The film also contains no gore. I liked the soundtrack during all those strange dream type sequences, but this wasn't enough to redeem the film. It's a non-violent calm toned drama that gets talky in parts. I didn't find anything disturbing or shocking in it, and the sexual sequences and nudity are not exploitive. I didn't like the film, but I think some will find it to be a well made and stylish film. There's a scene when a woman rides a large and stationary mechanical horse that goes up and down; that was pretty good and stylish. I also think many will like some of the films soothing, calm toned soundtracks. Some will like the movie because they'll like the style, story, directing, soundtracks, and acting, as well as the overall look of this film that's well made, but others won't be able to get involved in it.

The blu-ray has grain, but it looks really good and allows you to get a good look at the films scenery. The DVD also looks good, but the blu-ray is obviously much better. I personally didn't think the extras are anything special. Since this is supposed to be a limited release, I thought they could've made the blu ray menu screen and chapter stops more interesting with animation; however, it doesn't have any.",1420070400,7,2335,4.612980769230769

8659185,4,B00KI5SH02,"This movie has pretensions of being a cerebral work, so if you are looking for hot girl-on-girl action, intense ponygirl scenes or sadistic whippings, better stick to the internet and the short movie delivery system that must not be named.

The story concerns the ""countess"", Sylvia, who is portrayed as agoraphobic and submissive to an extreme degree, taking employment as a ""companion"" to a famous starlet, Margaret, who makes it clear she is paying for someone to whom she can dominate (in a non-overtly sexual context I might add). Yes there is nudity, well, there are topless scenes, but Margaret hates lesbians and doesn't seek that response from Sylvia.

Sylvia has many bizarre fantasy dream sequences, filmed in low-res and slow-motion for the most part, involving bondage, some rather laughable and entirely unconvincing whipping (which might have been the point, emphasizing the dream-like quality of the pseudo-violent fantasy from the submissive's viewpoint, I dunno) and some pony play. It also involves one of the fattest men I've ever seen on film, wearing some sort of loincloth/leather belt costume. I think this was intended to ensure that there was no chance of enjoying those sequences on a prurient level. Worked for me. I wanted to wash out my eyes with battery acid after one otherwise tame scene.

Sylvia gradually becomes more and more submissive, refusing to stand up for herself in any way, enjoying the security that not having to think for herself or deal with the outside world in any way brings. Margaret goes from petty and childish behavior such as throwing things on the floor just to see Sylvia pick them up, to using Sylvia as a Barbie doll and playing dress-up with her. There is no hint of Lesbian eroticism in these scenes. Margaret is either in heavy denial or simply does not see Sylvia in that light.

A male friend sees Sylvia for what she is, or thinks he does, and would like to strip her of her humanity and make her in reality nothing but a slave, an object, but Margaret, for all her bizarre drive to dominate Sylvia, is always aware that it is all a game and has no wish, indeed has a repugnance toward, everything her friend suggests.

Eventually it all comes apart at the seams in the same way The Story of O does - when Sylvia is confronted with the choice of waking up or of continuing in her fantasy world - but not with Margaret in either case.

Not the softcore you will be expecting. Most Italian movies expect the audience to participate in the process of telling a story rather than to sit back and just go along for the ride, and The Slave is no exception. The little B&D you do see is not very convincing, though that may be the point. Also, this was made in a time before audiences demanded ultra-realism in their films' imagery.

The print is good and the sound great for the most part, at least, on the DVD disc (I don't have a blu-ray player or high-def TV so cannot comment on the experience of that). The audio is Italian with English subtitles.",1413849600,19,3013,4.662900188323917
8659186,4,B00KI5SH02,"This one was originally released way back in 1969 under the title ""Scacco alla regina"" (English translation: ""Check to the Queen""), and was about a pretty younger woman, Silvia (23-year old Hayde Politoff) willingly allowing herself to be enslaved by a bitchy, domineering actress named Margaret (30-year-old Rosanna Schiaffino).  But despite the enormously erotic lesbian-overtones involving a dominant older woman finding herself in possession of a beautiful younger woman, this film chooses not to go in that direction!  It's seriously flawed by the simple fact that the dominant older woman here isn't interested in sex with girls.  I'm guessing that Italy in '69 wasn't yet ready for a film focusing on a purely lesbian sub/dom relationship, despite Silvia's complete willingness to act the part, and to do whatever it takes to please her new mistress.

There's a great scene towards the very end where I was certain we were finally going to witness a highly-erotic girl/girl sexual encounter --- it was all set-up so perfectly --- Margaret tears off most of Silvia's dress and wrestles the pretty girl to the floor --- but after a brief kiss to get things started the older woman suddenly-&-inexplicably demands that Silvia leave the room immediately, and the very next day she holds an AUCTION among her decadent-wealthy-friends to sell Silvia to the highest bidder.

Again, look at that DVD box-cover and tell me this this video should have been about an older lesbian woman enjoying her pretty female slave sexually.  Instead we get a bitchy actress bathing together with the girl, occasionally stripping and even whipping her --- but that's all.  It's erotic, but also quite frustrating for those of us wishing for something more!",1411344000,9,1740,5.148936170212766
