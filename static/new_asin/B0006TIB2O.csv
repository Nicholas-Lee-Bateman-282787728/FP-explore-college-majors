2194414,4,B0006TIB2O,"Another fantastic and obscure gem.  If you love ""Casablanca"" and other  romantic desert adventures, you shouldn't miss this one.  It features Errol Flynn and Ian Hunter as two very sporting British officers stationed in what sounds like 1920's Iraq and then Kay Francis comes between them.  Wonderfully directed by William Dieterle, with some great sets and photography, and to top things off, a  nice little Eric Korngold score.  I had never seen Francis before, but she is good in this, as are both Flynn and Hunter.  ""Dawn"" is a must for Flynn fans, as these type of melodramas were good vehicles for him, outside of his usual costume spectacles.  All in all, a vintage treasure.",1408406400,9,682,4.869565217391305
2194415,5,B0006TIB2O,Errol Flynn and Kay Francis great together. I saw this on TCM so there were no commercials. I wish they would bring more Errol Flynn movies and that there were DVD' of this movie.  Barb,1390694400,3,185,4.285714285714286
2194416,5,B0006TIB2O,"I have been looking for this movie for eight years. Now I have 59 Errol Flynn movies. I was however, a little disappointed that it was taped off the TV. It had parts of commericals in it.",1388361600,6,187,4.081081081081081
8043001,3,B0006TIB2O,"One of the lesser known, but still enjoyable Errol Flynn movies, a quite charming little film, with attractive sets and camera work, not a lot of plot, but what there is, is handled well. The stars are of a calibre that we shall never see again, so like most films of the era, an important historical reference to the times. why I give it only 3 stars, is because parts of the film are quite blurry, which is disappointing for someone like Warner Brothers who should have access to pristine negatives of all the films they made? Guess they just don't put in the care and money to these DVD-R 'Archive' releases, and they are the ones that should be remastered properly! Maybe they should hand them over to someone like Criterion?",1507334400,,729,4.53030303030303

He is the  good guy to always have a round.  In this role he is stretched a little more.  Great sets and wonderful music by Korngold.",1469059200,,277,4.150943396226415

8043005,3,B0006TIB2O,"Another Dawn is a 1937 love triangle melodrama starring Errol Flynn and Kay Francis. It was adapted from a 1919 Somerset Maugham play called Caesars Wife and has a lot of the sentiment from that period.

Errol Flynn (1909-59) plays a senior officer who falls in love with his commanding officers wife. Flynn was not yet a big star when he made this film. His Captain Blood (1935) had been a big hit as was the Light Brigade (1936), but his climb to the A list lay a few years ahead with Robin Hood (1938). His acting is quite good and at this time in his life he is incredibly handsome. But there isn't much action in this film, and Flynn was best in this genre.

Attractive Kay Francis (1905-68) plays the wife of Flynns commanding officer. Francis was the #1 Warners female star in the mid 30s, before Bette Davis took over. She won no awards but her films like Trouble in Paradise (1932), One Way Passage (1932), I Found Stella Parrish (1935) and Confession (1937) were box office hits. But by the end of the decade, Francis was listed as box office poison (along with Mae West, Katherine Hepburn, and Marlene Dietrich) and her career declined.

Handsome Ian Hunter (1900-75) plays the commanding officer. Hunter is probably best remembered for his role as King Richard in the 1938 Adventures of Robin Hood (also with Flynn) and his recurring role on the TV series of the same name.

Short and pudgy Herbert Mundin (1898-1939) provides the comic relief. Hes best known as one of Robin Hoods merry men, the one who has a romance with Maid Marians aide (played by Una OConnor)

The film is directed by William Dieterle, who is b est known for his films with Paul Muni (e.g., Emile Zola, Juarez, Pasteur). IMO  Dieterles best film is The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). Dieterle came from the German expressionist school of filming but we see very little of the German influence in this film.

Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957) composed. Korngold made more than 20 films, was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won once (Robin Hood in 1938). He did most of Errol Flynns swashbucklers.

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were Snow White, Saratoga, One Hundred Men and a Girl, Topper, and Wee Willie Winkie. The Oscars went to The Life of Emile Zola (Picture), The Awful Truth (Director), The Good Earth (Actress) and Captains Courageous (Actor). Other notable releases that year were Dead End, The Prince and the Pauper, the Marx Brothers A Day at the Races, and A Star is Born. Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (Thoroughbreds Dont Cry) and 17 year old Lana Turner appeared in They Wont Forget and became the Sweater girl. Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

Bottom line  an OK film, but really only Flynn fans will want to see it.",1452988800,2,2825,4.609561752988048

8043007,3,B0006TIB2O,"Well acted desert adventure with standard three way love affair in the desert.  Ian Hunter is a British officer who returns home and falls in love with Kay Francis, a woman whose great love has been killed in action and she doesn't love him, still he talks her into marrying him.  On returning his best friend (Errol Flynn) and his new wife fall in love.  All love and admire each other nobly. Good entertaining flick, most Flynn movies are.
--Spoiler Alert!! -- While the film was being made Errol Flynn evolved into a major star on the basis of two of his previous films ""Charge Of The Light Brigade"" and ""Captain Blood"" and was now a hot property.  The original ending to the film had him dying and Hunter and Francis returning to each other to make the censors happy.  With his prominence now in place the ending was rewritten with Hunter dying nobly and Flynn and Francis standing side by side.  No matter the ending the trio turned in a fine performance.  Worth a watch.",1426550400,2,976,4.511363636363637

8043009,3,B0006TIB2O,"Much as I'm a big fan of Errol Flynn and Kay Francis, this isn't a particularly memorable effort for either. Usually so easygoing and self-confident, Flynn seems uncomfortable in the role. Likewise Francis looks - and acts - bored, and displays little of the spark she had in films like Trouble in Paradise and Jewel Robbery just a few years before. But mostly there's simply little chemistry between Flynn and Francis, between Francis and Ian Hunter for that matter. It's tempting to say the best member of the cast is Frieda Inescort, well cast as as the Flynn character's uber-English sister.
Otherwise, this one is most notable for the as usual sparking Korngold score. I'd say this isn't a bad movie so much as a dull one. Three stars.",1420070400,2,740,4.744186046511628
8043010,4,B0006TIB2O,Obscure movie I had never heard of from the pre war colonial genre. Nothing special but Kay Francis lovely as the female center of interest. I love these movies and certainly it was a poignant watch.,1413244800,2,199,4.555555555555555
