5927235,5,B00ELKDD9U,"Weeds is a series that is the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and social commentary. Each episode is better than the last. Everything in weeds holds together. The magic in weeds comes from its ability to make the ridiculously unbelievable to ridiculously believable. It's been a long time since i've seen a TV show air with this level of quality in both script and production values. There is an all star cast from Mary-Louise parker to Liz Perkins and Kevin Nealon, which yields superb acting.

The editing is also top notch. God, I love that introduction, genius. Just remember that soon you'll have this show stuck in your head. I know I do. ....little boxes, little boxes, made of ticky tacky little boxes.... Suburbia will never be the same.",1384387200,,746,4.782945736434108
5927236,5,B00ELKDD9U,Great package!!! You really can't beat it unless it becomes less than the original release! If it included iTunes instead of Ultra Violet it would be perfect.,1384128000,,158,4.888888888888889
5927237,5,B00ELKDD9U,"This was a great purchase for the entire series on Blu-ray. The glowing case is amazing and the packaging of the discs is very well done as a scrapbook of the entire 8 seasons. It's a book full of pictures, art, and episode synopsis. The only con is that the discs themselves are a little hard to remove from their safety sleeves that make up each page. Overall great deal!!!",1383782400,25,375,4.371428571428571
5927238,5,B00ELKDD9U,Can't wait for my copy.  Very smooth concept I love that vivid translucent case! The DVD book must have beautiful pictures.,1381104000,3,123,4.857142857142857
5927239,4,B00ELKDD9U,"If you don't own ""Weeds"" on blu-ray yet, then this will likely be your best and cheapest option (rather than buying the seasons individually).  But if you already own some or all of the seasons, you'll have to decide whether or not its worth it to upgrade to this set.  There are two advantages to owning this set: First, there are four new special features (including a cast roundtable) that are only available on this Complete Collection.  Second, the discs come inside ""glowing"" acrylic packaging that collectors may want to own.

This show is a somewhat polarizing one: some people really love it, others really dislike it.  If you've never seen ""Weeds"", I'd suggest you sample it before purchasing this complete set.  If you have Netflix, the entire show is available there.  In my opinion, the show fluctuates in quality season to season - but at its best it makes for great television.

5927241,4,B00ELKDD9U,"This show is fanatastic. The box this came in was green plastic that was cracked and missing a huge portion. I don't care much about that, but whoever designed the packaging needs a different job. I had to use Kleenex to take the discs out of the sleeves because they don't come out easily or give you access to the middle of the disc. So you have to grab the disc to remove it.

5927252,5,B00ELKDD9U,"Series Review (No Spoilers) - Five Stars

I refrained from trying this series until after the show ended, because I figured it was like Beavis & Butthead - people getting high and laughing at anything and everything. There is a little of that, but for the most part it's a very complex, dark comedy. The basis of the show is the business side of weed-dealing in suburbia, but also takes the cast through literal and figurative, unexpected journeys through the eight seasons. I've binge-watched the series several times since I first tried it.

Packaging Review - One star

The outer-packaging of the Blu-Ray discs is admittedly cool-looking and unique, but as mentioned in other reviews, the individual disc-holders seem cheap and make it difficult to remove the discs.",1501459200,,769,4.9921875
5927253,5,B00ELKDD9U,"Great series.  Be warned the disks are very, very hard to get out.  Have a disk you don't care about to loosen up the pages/folders.

5927258,1,B00ELKDD9U,"I enjoyed Weeds when I watched some of it, so I was eager to watch the whole lot in glorious hi def Blu Ray. But whoever designed the packaging on this should be fired! Seriously, I couldn't even get some of the discs out. And those that did, well they don't do the disc or viewing experience any favours. It's a good price that's for sure, but for less hassles you'd be better exploring other options such as iTunes. Cheers and good luck!",1494201600,,439,4.301204819277109
5927259,3,B00ELKDD9U,"The packaging is a real frustration, I ended up cutting the decorative case up and stored the disks in a sleeve. the quality is top notch on the video.",1491436800,,151,4.241379310344827
5927260,4,B00ELKDD9U,I loved it the only problem I had was the last disc skipped if it wasn't for that I would have given it a 5 star,1490745600,,112,3.3461538461538463

5927262,5,B00ELKDD9U,"I love Weeds, but the Ultra-Violet code went out of date in 2014 (could not redeem). The price is great, but you need to remove the Ultra-Violet tag as it is no longer correct.",1490400000,3,176,4.205882352941177
5927263,1,B00ELKDD9U,"Not a comment on the quality of the show, just want to say that this is the worst packaging I've ever come across. It's almost impossible to remove the disks from the sleeves and if you are successful they are inevitably covered in big fingerprints. Seriously, what Muppet came up with this idea",1490313600,,295,4.584905660377358
5927264,1,B00ELKDD9U,"What the hell had Mary-Louise Parker been thinking when she agreed to star in this awful, awful series?! ... This awfully, awfully pathetic series?! Weeds is an utter disgrace to the performing arts, and its cancellation is way past due.

A perfect example of Coonery and Buffoonery in the modern era, Weeds is horribly racist, and insultingly derogatory. Its effect is nothing more than bitter loathsomeness.

This series is by far one of the most disgusting that I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. And if there is even one drop of justice in the Motion Picture Arts, each one of its Master copies will be cremated to ashes - or at least cellared, that they will never again be utilized for the purpose of reproduction to future generations of television viewers.

Jenji Kohan, are you serious? You actually created this detritus?

Mary-Louise Parker, you're much better than this.

SHOWTIME, shame on every decision-making member of your operating body.

Lest I be misunderstood by any, I should also add that here is a VERY (emphasis on very) thin line between satire and coonery. Weeds exhibits the latter.",1489622400,,1117,4.946524064171123
5927265,4,B00ELKDD9U,"This dark comedy is a great series to binge-watch.  The Blu Ray transfer is excellent and the sound is great.  The weird thing is the packaging.  In some ways it is wonderful.  The complete collection comes in a book-like package with pages listing the content along with episode stills...very nice.  The bad thing (as stated in some reviews) is that it is impossible to take out the discs...the attached sleeves are basically glued around each disk with no way to take the disk out.  What I did find is that if you take your finger on the inside of each sleeve and basically go around both glued sides (about 3/4 of the way down on each side) like you were using a letter opener, you can then easily pull out each disk without damaging them.  Also, that seems to also hold the disks in place when you put them back in.  Not a show stopper, but enough to knock it down 1 star.",1488931200,8,876,4.331288343558282

5927267,1,B00ELKDD9U,"I am so unhappy that I paid for this collection and EVERY SINGLE DISC SKIPS!!! They are not scratched or smudged and they skip, I think that's what makes me so frustrated.

5927279,5,B00ELKDD9U,"Amazing instant cult classic show. Showtime really knows how to do it for the last 10 years. Great comeback acting revival for the lovely Mary-Louise Parker. Lovely box set, came fast, nothing wrong with my box. Sturdy green color for the weed influence on the box. Nice overall set for real fans. I own every season blu ray separately, and they are great as well with most of the same features. This box set is just all the seasons together obviously, in a nice box set, and maybe a couple more bonus features that aren't on the regular blu rays DVD's.. hope this helps. But overall pure A+ for me. I'm very happy. Looks great in my collection.",1483142400,3,645,4.47457627118644

The irreverent adventures of a 30 something, widowed, mother of two (boys), who becomes a suburban pot dealer to help make ends meet.  Mary-Louise Parker is brilliant as the always intoxicating Nancy Botwin. Unlike many shows that last for numerous seasons, Weeds continued the character development of all the characters with gusto.  We watch Nancy evolve, her sons grow into young men, and  her circle of friends/frenemies deal with it all.  This show will have you laughing in the aisles until the last episode (which may leave you crying).

5927306,3,B00ELKDD9U,"I saw Parker in Reds and loved her. I decided to watch Weeds assuming it was a comedy but what a surprise that turned out to be: a tragedy. By Season 3 I realized Parker was playing herself in the series and both films. I did a marathon to season 7 and finally gave up as it was clear the character, Nancy, had learned nothing from her trials, tribulations, and self-destructive tendencies. I learned over the series she had a rep in high school as well as college, was a poor wife, a worse mother, a worse provider (as she kept digging deeper holes for herself and everyone had to rescue her over and over, betrayed every friend as well as her family. She burned every bridge built. It was clear why her father-in-law didn't want his son to marry her for he was able to see who she really way,and he was absolutely correct. Nancy went from a widowed wife, mother trying to survive financially to morally bankrupting all who came into contact with her--her sons being the first casualties. All that being said, what really saves this series is the supporting cast. In particular the brother of Nancy's deceased husband. I found him annoying but always with good intentions which is not the case with the others. This is really an intriguing view into the world of MJ (legal and otherwise) but more than anything it is a harsh look into a totally dysfunctional family destroyed by a worse female who was selfish and sociopath. I kept watching as it did hook me but I found as I watched it I hated the character Nancy and kept hoping for someone to kill her as she kept begging for it with her conduct. Oh, and one final note, Parker is not that great an actress as it is clear from this series and both films, she is merely playing herself.",1468022400,,1739,4.420560747663552

5927308,3,B00ELKDD9U,"Be aware of the poor authoring quality of the first two seasons, the discs in this box are the exact same ones previously released in US separately.

Season 1: The whole season is all crammed into one disc, video compressed with inefficient MPEG2 compression at overall bit rate 16.4 Mbps, lossy DTS-HD HR audio at 6.1 channels. The quality is bad even when compared to most DVD's. I ended up buying the European Sony Pictures released season 1 to complement this box (that has 25.5 Mbps AVC video and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio).

Season 2: Looks better than the first season, but still very noisy video with artifacts (16.6 Mbps AVC video and LPCM 7.1 16bit audio). I have seen recent Blu-ray discs with similar bit rate that looked just fine, but it was 10 years ago this disc was authored, encoding techniques have probably evolved since then.

The rest of the seasons (AVC/DTS-HD MA) range from okay to very good quality. Good show at a good price with a nice box. But it is disappointing that no effort was made on the actual discs/content. They could at least have re-encoded the first two seasons to meet modern standards, I would have happily paid some dollars more for that.",1465516800,4,1180,4.636363636363637

However, with WEEDS I believe she has totally outdone herself and I could never see anyone else playing that role. If you haven't seen this year is yet watch the first 5 episodes Season 1 and you will be addicted.

I didn't buy this item on Amazon because I found a better deal elsewhere where they don't charge state sales tax.

It's a very stupid show.  How does a woman maintain her suburban lifestyle by slangin' 2 ounces of swag weed at a time? & she had to put up her Range Rover for collateral on 2 zips SMH  Then there is the stupid way that they portray the black family that sells her the weed (seriously was this suppose to be funny)  I could only get through about 7 episodes until I'd had enough of this show. The only thing that made me get through 7 episodes was Kevin Nealon's character whom was actually funny.  At least he still has ""IT"".

Well, it looks like the packaging has been altered because of all the complaints. Instead of there being 2 discs in each slot, which would make very hard to get the discs out without either scratching them or cracking them, the packaging company set it up so there are 17 slots for each of the 17 dvd's. They are still a bit tough to remove, but I put on a rubber glove and was able to slide each of the discs out fairly well. Now, instead of having to put each disc back in it's slot, which is still a tight fit, I just put each of the 17 dvd's into 17 separate plastic dvd holders and numbered each of the holders with the season.

5927415,4,B00ELKDD9U,"That Nancy.  I got into this show purely because I'm in love with Mary-Louise Parker (and okay, of course, the title subject), and after a fair-to-middling 1st season (other than Breaking Bad, is there any show that doesn't have a fair-to-middling 1st season?) I found myself steadily surprised at just how funny and creative it was, and even found myself moved--- no, seriously, moved--- by the last scene of the last episode.  For a show that made fun of drug culture (and consequences), sexual orientations, and social/racial stereotypes, it's true what you may have heard: Weeds' biggest risk was that Parker's hot mess (truly) of a mom is not always totally likable (at times she threatens to become a sexy Walter White, and indeed the makers of Bad briefly worried about similarities).  It's not that she's a bad person; it's that her pleasure- and danger-loving weak will inevitably makes bad stuff happen, even and especially to the people she loves.  But unlike BB, Weeds is a broad comedy about redemption, and it pulls off its goals without ever quite detouring to heartwarming.  Plus, Kevin Nealon as the dumbest stoner since Chong makes it more than worth the time.  Happy Mother's Day, everybody",1399593600,,1209,4.96039603960396

5927420,1,B00ELKDD9U,"This rating is for the brain-dead packaging, a defective (scratched) disc and the lousy Amazon return policy.  I guess I was supposed to watch this entire eight season series in a marathon.  Well, that is what you would have to do in order to identify any defect in the very short return/exchange window.  I can understand a one month return window for a movie, no big deal.  But to expect someone to watch and entire series in a month?  Ludicrous.  I can guarantee you this is the last full series I will ever buy.  Think about it... one defective disk (out of 16) and the whole ($120) series is trash.
I'm really not sure if the packaging is a separate issue.  It could very well be the cause of the defective disc.  A quick scan of reviews reveals I'm not the only one who had issues with the vice-grip-of-death packaging.  Removing a disc without breaking it is nothing short of a miracle.

5927425,1,B00ELKDD9U,"I wish this box set could be given 0 stars.  Purchased elsewhere for about 1/2 price.

You MUST grab the disks from both sides and TUG on them to get them out of the sleeves. Not merely tight, disks don't ""slide out"", you have to physically tug them out of the sleeve.  Putting them back in in is the same ordeal in reverse.  In my mind, I could just hear the discs snapping in two when forcing them back into the slots....didn't happen, but there is A LOT of stress put on these discs when either removing or replacing.  Read the other reviews...people watching only the digital copies for fear of damaging the disks when removing.  Crazy!

How about a little truth in advertising? ""Box is crud, you're better off just downloading the episodes"".  I DO NOT like the trend makers are following with box sets these days....charging PREMIUM prices for extremely cheap box sets.  It may cost more, but buyers who wish their set to last any amount of time, would be better off buying the seasons separately.",1394409600,28,1002,4.553072625698324

I have to admit I really like the box set itself the glowing case and the book that the discs come in is neat to it even has pics from episodes like its a real book. But with that being said here's the down side the book is made of cardboard and the slots don't seem to be big enough to get the discs out at least not without damaging them or the book. Honestly I haven't even watched the set to make sure it works because I'm afraid to damage the discs I just watch the digital copy.

My advice is get the ultraviolet digital copies that come with the set and watch those and don't watch the  actual set cause you'll just ruin it.

By season 4 the show had done about as much as it could with the concept, and the characters were turned into parodies of themselves who smirk their way through murder and rape.

This disks slide sideways out of the book pages and the opening is much smaller that the disk, so the only way to get them out is to grab the disk from both sides with fingers (I don't recommend pliers) and pull them out. The disks cannot be easily taken out, you have to apply a lot of force to slide them out and risk cracking. If they don't crack, you have to wipe the disks from your finger marks (I had a wiping cloth next to me while I was watching the show). Similarly, you can't easily put the disks back in.

It's unbelievable that someone could design a booklet like this. This is just dumb! If you don't want to crack or otherwise damage the disks, it could be best to extract the disks once and store them elsewhere. Then what's the point of having a booklet?",1386460800,21,891,4.272189349112426

She uses and treats her brother in law like cheap. She dominates her kids, making them her little puppets. She lies to her kids about very important things, then cries the victim when confronted. She dresses super sleazy for a upper middle aged woman. She can't act. I was surprised she was nominated for any awards. She treated her brother in law with no respect and expected him to always be there and cater to her. I don't understand why any man would be attracted to her. She treats her friends horribly. She uses everyone she comes in contact with. I had really hoped she would change as a person, but that never happened. The brother in law and oldest son were the best actors. I found myself hoping and wishing bad things would happen to her. At the end, a few people distanced themselves from her, which was good and best for them. She was a horrible person. I didn't think there were any comical parts. The acting was horrible, especially the main character. I'm really sad that I wasted all that time watching this show and hating her and her character so intensely. I'm sad that I hoped through every episode, bad things would happen to her.
