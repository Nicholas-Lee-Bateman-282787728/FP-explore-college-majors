7872162,5,6304448686,"This Canadian series is a great way to learn about ballet.  Even if you are a professional you might learn a thing or two, and when he says that dancing Prince Albrecht in Swan Lake is a lot like getting hit by a truck, Barishnikov was probably nodding his head and saying, ""Da.""  Informative with a great sense of humor, they will teach you a real appreciation of ballet as an art form and as a great tradition that every person who places a hand on the barre, lifts a chin, and tries to turn out from the hips becomes a part of.  It's too bad you can't get these on DVD.  They should be reissued so you can make your boy friend watch before you drag him off to see Giselle.  He might actually enjoy Giselle when he understands the painful hard work that goes into it, as well as the nuances in the story.  I'm collecting the whole series before it disappears.",1351036800,,861,4.219512195121951
