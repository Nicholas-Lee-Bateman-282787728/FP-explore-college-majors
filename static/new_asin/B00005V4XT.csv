Just to let you all know it's Canada, not American voice acting. Also their voices are pretty much the new My Little Pony voices show you guys love so much.",1523577600,,280,4.30188679245283

How will she capture the Cloud Card with a fever and Tori watching her every move? Next off,a painting is vandalized at the museum Sakura is visiting.

This was a great DVD! I recommend it to all Cardcaptor lovers!",1053993600,2,701,4.358778625954199
7955984,5,B00005V4XT,"This is a cool DVD! I love it! It comes with 3 episodes.  1. Sakura is sick! She stays home from school. At night Sakura found out there was a card called ""The Cloud"". Sakura sneaks out to capture The Cloud. But she has one problem, how will her brother Tori know where Sakura is? Sakura used ""The Mirrior"" card to make two Sakura's. Confusing right? Anyways she was going to capture the card. Sakura felt like she was going to faint but then Melin one of her friends helped her to capture it. Its captured. Sakura went back home and then she went back to sleep.
2. Sakura and her class go to the art museum. Sakura found out that the picture was a Clow Card. So at night Sakura was going to capture it till she bumped into a kid named Alex. Alex's father painted the picture. Sakura captured the card called ""The Silent"".
3. On this episode it shows where Sakura captured all the cards. It won't show every single card where Sakura captures them. Only a few. They talk about ""The Fly"", ""The Power"", ""The Time"", ""The Twin"", ""The Cloud"", ""The Shot"", ""The Snow"", ""The Watery"", ""The Earthy"", ""The Light"", ""The Dark"" and finnaly a part of The Final Judgement.
You will like this video alot! Well enjoy this video!",1052611200,2,1209,4.397321428571429
7955985,2,B00005V4XT,"In this VHS there are three episodes in randomly put together.
The first episode is when Sakura gets sick with the fever. despite warnings from Kero, Sakura uses the mirror card in order to sneak out of the house the capture the cloud card, but Sakura has trouble just standing! Li (Syaoran) helps Sakura out, with a lot more patience than usual. Mei lin (MeiLing) helps out too. Very cute episode.
The next episode is when Sakura's class visits the art museum. Sakura discovers there is actually the voice card hidden in one of the pictures. Later that night, she returns to the picture, and runs into a kid named Alex. Alex's father painted the picture, and she wants to fix it. Without showing Alex her power's, Sakura must find a way to capute the card, but it is harder then it looks! Every time they get close to the picture, they are warped outside, because the voice card does not like sound. At the end, you see 'Li' or Syaoran. This were it is weird, because before, 'Li' was in the show, now he is just a shadow. This ep. is actually one of sakura's first captures, before the real arrival of 'Li' in ""Saura's New Rival!""
In next ep. is from the second arc, with Eriol, or 'Eli.' Yue and Kero can't transform, and Sakura has two help them, but try keeping to large gaurdian beasts in your room without your brother (or anyone else) finding out.
These episodes are pretty cute, but I do not recommend the dubbed series. It was done horribly, but, if it is your only choice go right ahead. These episode are some of the few that stay close the original ""CardCaptor Sakura."" Otherwise, get the original. It is so much better, and even cutier! The dubbed voices, plot, characters (and character development), and general stuff is is way out of the ""CardCaptor Sakura"" league.",1025049600,9,1782,4.537267080745342
