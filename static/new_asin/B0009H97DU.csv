My 21 month old LOVES these videos. They're very entertaining and she seems to enjoy interacting with it...we sit together and watch and she watches alone, too. I don't think there is any problem with her watching programs like this, it's fine, my husband and I watch TV so it's unrealistic to have NO TV in the home. In any case, the videos are all a big hit with her, she just loves them and I actually like them more than Baby Einstein. Plus they don't have those annoying repetitive intros and 2 menus every time I put one in!!!!!",1194307200,4,576,4.433962264150943
8060644,5,B0009H97DU,"Please Do not listen to the review that is against Brain Baby. I have a 21 month old girl who knows her alphabet and can count to 10. I believe with all my heart that Brainy Baby had a lot of do with it. It is NOT a Babysitter, it is a tool for a child to learn.

8060645,1,B0009H97DU,"Although well meaning, the brainy baby line often makes claims to education through TV that are less than convincing.  Working as a professional, private educator, and having studied the development of creativity in my M.Ed. from Harvard, I find Brainy Baby's claims of their product's educational value dubious at best.  While studies have shown that shows like Sesame Street and Blue's Clues--through symbolic repetition--can have a substantive impact on preschool cognitive development, there is little reason to believe that these same techniques have comparable impacts on toddlers.  If your goal is to enhance creativity in your youngsters, give them three-dimensional toys that fit with their more tactile and auditory stage of development.  Save the TV for your own time.",1177977600,7,779,5.5210084033613445
