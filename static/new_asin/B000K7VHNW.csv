2684606,4,B000K7VHNW,"Penelope Cruz & Salma Hayek team up in a slapstick western about 2 girls whose father's are murdered on the same day by the same man. they set out to take him out and start robbing banks at gun point to help with their mission. in the mean time, they must stop him from stealing millions of dollars in gold & with some help along the way from fellow friends, these girls are more then ready to stop the ruthless man. I have to admit, these two girls have never been sexier! lots of nice cleavage shots! the acting is spot on! some of the lines Penelope delivers would never be funny if it wasn't for her, she just makes them work for some reason! there's alot of flaws in the plot, yes it's predictable for the most, yes there's not a strong plot. it's just one of those feel good films that lets you enjoy it & I did!",1168819200,3,818,4.11875
2684607,4,B000K7VHNW,"Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek are two of the most beautiful women on the screen today, and they serve up a double helping of South of the Border sex and sizzle in BANDIDAS.  The story is definitely B-grade, but once expectations are properly dialed in, it's a hoot watching Cruz and Hayek chew up the scenery as they play mismatched and hot-tempered Mexican women of the 1880s who are out for revenge.

Cruz stars as Maria Alvarez, the daughter of a dirt-poor farmer, while Hayek plays spoiled Sara Sandoval, the daughter of the region's richest man.  When they first meet, neither of them like each other.  But when Maria's father is gunned down and left for dead while their farm is taken from them and Sara's father is murdered in cold blood, they gradually bond for revenge.

Country star Dwight Yoakum stars as the bad guy, Tyler Jackson, whose in charge of getting a railroad ran through the heart of Mexico by whatever means it takes.  Sam Shepard plays Bill Buck, a former bank robber who teaches Maria and Sara to rob banks and forge a friendship.  Steve Zahn stars as Quentin Cooke, a forerunner in forensic detection that gets caught up in Maria and Sara's schemes.  The film was produced and co-written by Luc Besson, who has headed up several action pictures such as THE PROFESSIONAL, THE TRANSPORTER, KISS OF THE DRAGON.

Seeking revenge, Sara and Maria start robbing all the banks Tyler Jackson has taken over.  Each of them bring skills to their efforts.  Maria has a trick horse that she plays tic-tac-toe with and can talk to.  The horse also tells other horses what to do.  She's also a great pistol shot.  Sara, though she can simper over a manicure, is also a great planner and can be driven to see things through on a large scale.

Although this film isn't going to change your life or address any social problems in a meaningful way (although there is a line in the movie that basically says the United States should keep their noses in their own affairs), BANDIDAS is easy on the eyes and fun to watch.  The plot takes predictable turns, but that's made up by the pacing.  You see everything coming, but it happens so quickly that you're already onto the next thing in record time.

The predictable cat-fighting that goes on between the two leads doesn't get tiresome because it never takes itself seriously or overstays its welcome.  Likewise with the kissing scene (although Steve Zahn must have loved the retakes) where they competed for Quentin Cooke's attention.

Everything comes comfortably together within ninety minutes, and the movie is a romp that involves sexy clothing, girls fighting, some real fighting, feats of derring-do that involve riding horses up ladders, swinging across courtyards, and blowing up buildings.  The dialogue is brisk and fun.

BANDIDAS is a great buddy flick, and maybe even one for a light couples night because there's enough comedy and action to satisfy everyone.",1168646400,11,2928,4.790836653386454
2684608,4,B000K7VHNW,"You just have to look at the poster to know what kind of moive this and isn't.  If you are looking for serious entertainmetn, boy are you in the wrong place!  This is eye candy movie making at its best. It is light breesy, and just plain fun. You have seen this all before and including the smarter than humans horse, but who cares!  It brings a smile to face and your butt doesn't get tired watching it.  The action is very good and the bad guy grows on you.  I will admitt what the he--, is Sam Sheppard doing in this movie, but with two lovely leading ladies like these two I bet he was having fun. Look this is one of those quilty pleasure movies you want to share wilth your friends, so share it!",1168646400,,701,4.087591240875913
2684609,4,B000K7VHNW,"BANDIDAS may not set new standards for filmmaking, whether those standards are for westerns, comedies, action flicks, or slapstick, but it is just as awful lot of fun to watch!  The script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is pretty shallow and at times borders on maudlin, but it is also peppered with some little one-liners that allow the stars to show off their comedic talents.

Directors Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg are neophytes and wisely allow the star qualities of Salma Hayek and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz to reign and  have a good time both as opposites (Hayak comes from money and education and Cruz comes from the farm) and as partners is bank robbing - done of course in the Robin Hood manner.  The bad guy is the reliable Dwight Yoakim and the fall guy is the always lively Steve Zahn.  The quasi-good guy who trains the divas to be robbers is portrayed by Sam Shepard.  And that is about all the viewer needs to know to realize the movie is in good hands.

No, the story isn't particularly ' find themselves - dividing their concentration between settling evil vendettas and vying for best kisser role with Steve Zahn.  This is a comedy, folks, and a good lighthearted outing for two of our best actresses.  Worth an evening's viewing!  Grady Harp, January 07",1168560000,,1280,4.674107142857143
2684610,4,B000K7VHNW,"I think most people understand that this is definitely just a ""dumb"" movie to just relax and enjoy.  I bought it expecting a medicore plot and silly action driven by two gorgeous ladies, and that's what the movie is.  It's a fun movie, and definitely not bad, if you go in with the right expectations.  Sure the acting isn't top notch, but Cruz and Hayek obviously look like they enjoyed doing the movie, and I think most people will enjoy watching this ""unlikely"" pair of bandidas",1168560000,2,481,4.569767441860465

2684614,3,B000K7VHNW,"Bandidas is the film where the two most famous latina stars of Hollywood, Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, team up as a dynamite cowgirl duo fighting evil in Mexico, 1888.
There has been a large negative buzz about this film which is a bit unfair. Bandidas is just not to be taken seriously and is just good old entertainment where you have to have your sense of humor switched on. If you are expecting a serious western-drama, you have to look someplace else.

The film, which was releashed in cinemas all over Europe in January and March 2006, wasn't a huge hit. The thing with people was that they were expecting something without so much humour but did get that, which dissapointed them. The humour is indeed a bit too much sometimes, but there are some hilarious moments in the film that are absolutely enjoyable.
The chemistry between Cruz and Hayek is delicious and you can see in the way they are acting that they had a fun time on the set making the film. Next to Cruz and Hayek there is Steve Zahn. Zahn does what he does best: playing a comedic sidekick. He is funny and plays his part well. Dwight Yoakam feels a bit miscast in the film but he does an okay job as the main villian.
There is some drama in the film that feels a bit outnumberd compairing it with the comedic moments which gives the film a kind of messy feeling sometimes. That is too bad, but overall doesn't bother you.

The film has been professionally made and looks good. The special effects, the lush Mexican locations and cameramovements are beautifully done which gives great cinematography. Also the music, composed by Eric Serra is very nice and gives some scenes a nice powerboost and a fun western flavour.

Still the best reason to buy the film are two elements: Cruz and Hayek. They are sexy, funny and make the film worth to take a look at. Some things are a bit over the top, but who cares: it entertains, and it is nice to kill 1 and a half hours of boredom and replace that with nice popcorn fun.
And most importantly: Bandidas leaves you with a smile on your face, and that is what entertainment is all about.",1163462400,45,2102,4.4404145077720205

2684616,4,B000K7VHNW,"This was a lot of fun--it's not a great movie, by any means, but everyone involved seems to know that, and they're more interested in making a fun piece of entertainment than trying to create a work of art. And it works. Cruz and Hayek work extremely well together, the plot holds up fairly well, the supporting actors are all decent, and it's a fun way to pass an hour and a half. No one is taking themselves or their roles too seriously, and the result is very enjoyable. So if you want to enjoy the company of two very friendly ladies who are very good actresses, this is a good film to watch.",1509840000,,596,4.2368421052631575

Salma Hayak and Penelope Cruz, for different reasons, take up the task of robbing banks being taken over by a New York Bank.  Dwight Yoakum plays the bad guy, and in usual bad guy fashion, gets to go over the top with his ruthlessness, and his hair styling.  Steve Zahn plays a CSI expert who shows up and is lured into helping the ladies.  Sam Shepard also on hand to give them lessons.  A fun romp, lots of anti-American corporate comments but then all works out in the end.

I just bought the DVD; I had waited years for this to come out on Blu-ray, but finally checked out the DVD, and the price was very nice, so I bought it.  I needn't have worried about video or audio quality, both are great.  My Oppo Blu-ray player upconverted the video; it looked wonderful on my 60"" plasma (viewed in a totally dark home theater).  The photography was gorgeous, with jaw-dropping scenic vistas at every turn; Cruz and Hayak were also gorgeous, but that was a given.  No complaints with the audio either through my 9.1 channel system; really nice.  Produced and written by Luc Besson (one of my favorites), the story was complete, feel-good and classy, somewhat of a surprise.  Really good chemistry between Cruz and Hayak; I learned from the extra features that they are good friends and had wanted to do a movie together, but when they could not find one, they put Bandidas together themselves--it was clear they had fun doing the movie.  Steven Zahn, their partner in crime, is also one of their mutual friends; he rounded out the threesome.  Not a heavy movie--just fun!

It also happens to be the feature film debut of ""Kon-Tiki"" Norwegian directors Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg. Being their first American film, I found it to be an impressive film that shares both laughs and the importance of teamwork and friendship.

I'll admit the plot may seem slightly predictable, but nevertheless I would recommend this film for those seeking complex scenarios crossed with witty humor.

I didn't choose this film under merely of fulfilling fantasies, but to witness the plot of a farm girl and a privileged girl working together for a similar cause with an interesting moral: No matter what background you came from, you may not be so different from one another.",1378944000,,835,5.087591240875913

2684790,4,B000K7VHNW,"I`ve always been a humongous fan of Penelope Cruz, so when I found this flick at my local library,it was an instant checkout. Set in Mexico, the movie centers on two young women, Maria and Sara, who form an unlikely duo in order to defeat an evil American baron. In a Robin Hood-esque twist, they become bandits, stealing from banks to give to poor Mexicans. Although packed wth humor from both funny situations and Sara and Maria`s rivalry, I can see why this did not become a ""big"" hit at the box office. The script is witty, but it dwindles too much on unnecessary details, and pits the two heroines against Quentin, a wimpy ""criminal investigator"", to vy for his affection. This movie is probably appropiate for about 12+, due to some action/adventure violence throughout, a pretty racy makeout scene involving Quentin and Sara-while she is clad in a revealing prostitute`s outfit- and a hilarious (but still unnecessary) view of Quentin`s bare butt. I still bought the movie because I loved Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek`s roles, but the plot was  stereotypical and way too breezy.",1364688000,,1086,4.838709677419355

2684805,3,B000K7VHNW,"This is the type of glossy, superficial Hollywood production that will be pleasant and diverting for some people but will prove unsatisfying and inadequate for others.  My opinion will have to reside somewhere in the middle.

It's really amazing to me that Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, as the stars, were responsible for a movie that's set in Mexico but where nobody ever speaks Spanish. This seems to me to be an unacceptabe denial of their heritage.  Perhaps a Spanish-language version of this movie was also made.  Even if that is the case, the beautiful Spanish language ought to be found in a movie situated in a Spanish-speaking country.

My central criticism of this film is that it is too lightweight.  The characters are simpletons and the plot is too trivial to even mention.  However, both Hayek and Cruz are truly very pleasing to watch and it is hard to sneer very forcefully at a movie that features them in all their sultry loveliness.

As good as those two actresses are, it must be said that Dwight Yoakam gives the most delightful performance in the film.  He makes a clever and clownish vaudeville villain and the stringy black wig that he wears throughout the movie never ceases to amuse.  This is the best performance that I've seen Yoakam give.  He really is developing well as a comic actor.

The very best feature of this film is the natural scenery that you will catch sight of behind the actors.  It is all quite gorgeous and Mexico has never looked more magnificent.  The makers of this movie are to be praised for their efforts to portray the physical wonders of Mexico in their full quixotic splendor.",1329264000,,1632,4.700704225352113
2684806,4,B000K7VHNW,"Despite what you see on the cover, this is a very funny movie in the same vein as Cat Ballou.  There's comedy and warmth between a farm girl and the European finishing school heiress as they learn to join forces to seek revenge and justice in their native Mexico.  Still, with the sexy trappings and innuendo, it's entertainment for adults.  There aren't any balladeers like Cat Ballou, and some of the music score goes a bit modern at moments, but that's the only reason I hold back a star.",1328918400,,491,4.49438202247191

2684810,4,B000K7VHNW,"Bandidas is unrepentant fun. Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz begin as opposites in a familiar western theme of revenge against the greedy out to murder, steal, and swindle their land. Initially distrustful of each other, fate soon unites the two feminine heroines against the unscrupulous Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam), ultimately prevailing in this swashbuckling action comedy. This film is multiculturalism at its funniest; it's a joint French/Mexican/American production starring the Spanish Cruz, the Mexican Hayek, filmed by two Norwegian directors, shot in Mexico.

Initially released only in Europe in 2006, the movie is over the top all the way.  It features bank robbery basic training, pratfalls galore, banjos, ice skates, and even ""Matrix-y"" type slow-mo action. This is the funniest western since Shanghai Noon, but it didn't have catfights. Veteran comedic comrade Steve Zahn is hilarious as the crime scene expert who joins forces with the bad girl robin hoods. Watching his ""seduction ""scene with Cruz and Hayek, I concluded that he must be the luckiest man in the history of motion pictures! As a robbery/action movie, I thought of comparing Bandidas to Oceans 11 and Mission Impossible, but this is sexier and funnier. Cruz and Hayek make a dynamic duo, and true to form in the end, they ride off into the sunset their legend only to increase.

I would have linked more special features. The principal actresses are interviewed, detailing that they had wanted to work together for years and that the whole western comedy robbery concept was theirs. They stress that this was challenging: more action and comedy than they were previously known for. Its lightweight, sexy, and hilarious; I can't thank them enough!",1302048000,,1728,5.231046931407942

Did I say that the flick was not amusing and enjoyable?

2684814,3,B000K7VHNW,"Just the combination of Penlope Cruz and Salma Hayek is enough to get me to see almost anything, and putting 'em in a western, well, that just makes it all the more delicious.  Theoretically.  This 2006 film, written and produced in part by French trash-auteur Luc Besson, not one of my favorite filmmakers at all, was a complete flop on release - I'm not sure it even got a theatrical run in the USA - and hasn't exactly gotten great marks from critics.  But, y'know, the ladies...and it was cheap, and I was in the mood for more Penlope after the latest Almodvar film, so here goes.

And...it's not really that bad, though it is somewhat dull and watered-down and juvenile and certainly lacking in originality.  Let's start with the rating; I'm not one to usually complain about such things, but PG-13?  No nudity and very little real violence?  In a western starring the two hottest Latinas around?  What, are we supposed to be so enchanted by their silly, bitchy bantering with each other, and the slapdash storyline of the two empowered women taking back their country that we forgive the lack of bone-crunching, blood-drenched body count and the covered-up nature of the two bodacious bosoms?

Well, almost, at least for a moment here and there.  Our story: rich educated Sara (Hayek) teams up with poor farm girl Maria (Cruz) to rob the banks taken over by the evil gringo Jackson (Dwight Yoakam, of course) who is bent on grabbing the whole wealth of Mexico on the pretext that he's the head of some big American bank consortium or some such thing.  That part of the film was just so silly from the get-go that I figured, why care?  What gets the two ladies together is that Jackson has killed Sara's father and wounded Maria's, and there is apparently nobody in all of northern Mexico who can stand up to him and his gang of a couple dozen thugs.

And neither can they, until they're led to ex-bank robber Bill Buck (Sam Shepard, fine as always though it could have been anybody) who teaches them everything there is to know about shooting and escaping and such in a couple of weeks.  And when they run into criminologist Quentin (Steve Zahn), hired by Jackson to solve the bank robberies, they quickly convince him - via blackmail in a scene that offers the closest this film ever has to sex - that the mustache-twirling Jackson (a Snidely Whiplash clone if you know what I mean) is a lying thief and the duo becomes a trio from which no bank is safe!

The chemistry between the two leading ladies is great, it's obvious they're close friends and had fun shooting this, and everybody seems to be having fun, which goes a long way for me with a stupid flick like this.  The photography by Thierry Arbogast, Besson's regular DP, is all sun-drenched late summer, overlit and golden, which usually irritates me but it works ok in this filmed-on-location Mexican setting; the music by Eric Serra is, not surprisingly, an unmemorable Ennio Morricone pastiche and there are many moments when directors Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg are clearly trying to go for a spaghetti feel, though the film always feels too fluffy and toned-down to ever get there.  The action sequences are pretty so-so, with a lot of slow-mo in the final gunfight, though surprisingly not much otherwise.

So, it's not really good or bad - if you're a fan of the two leading ladies, or just in the mood for some harmless dumb fun, you could do a lot worse.  It's certainly better than Salma's previous western WILD WILD WEST.  The audio commentary featuring both actresses just riffing on stuff is plenty of fun, too.",1265328000,,3597,4.6613924050632916
2684815,4,B000K7VHNW,"Bandidas is a highly entertaining, fun ride. It takes place in Mexico, during the Mexican revolution in the 1800s. Two drop-dead gorgeous young women (played by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek), decide to team-up and rob banks. This is quite a twist, from the usual macho western movie formula. The women commit robberies out of vengeance, in order to save land stolen from the Mexican people, by a villainous land baron.

The violence in the film is ubiquitous, as it is in most westerns. However, the violent tone of the movie, is leavened with a jaunty, slap-stick humor. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, play the bank robbing duo more like a squabbling Laverne and Shirley, rather than Butch and Sundance. They have hilarious cat-fights with each other, as they try to learn to work together as a team.

There's lots of incredible stunts throughout the film. Some are even performed by the horses, ridden by the characters. This is one of the few westerns I've seen, in which the steeds are as important to the plot, as the humans are. This factor highlights the overall lighted-hearted ambiance, running throughout the course of the film.

The serious business of justice and revenge is pursued with gusto, by the beautiful, bank-robbing two-some. But along the way, the viewer is treated to lots of belly-laughs. Watching this film, is a great way to get your funny-bone tickled, while rooting for the good guys (in this case gals), to triumph over evil.",1261872000,,1456,4.862903225806452

When I found out that Salma Hayek was in one(a campy one, at that) with Penelope Cruz, I decided to get the movie and watch it. Besides, like most of the movies I've found, it was in a bargain bin. It was great!!!

Maria Alvarez and Sarah Sandoval are two mexican women who seek to avenge their fathers' deaths by Tyler Jackson. Jackson, who's employed by the Bank of New York, is sent to Mexico to buy land and open banks. Thing is, he shoots down any one who opposes him from doing so. The two ladies join together and start robbing the banks owned by the Bank of New York. So, Quentin Cooke, a forensic criminalogist, goes on the lookout for them...only to be converted to their cause in an effort to bring down Jackson.

Directed by Espen Sandberg & Joachim Roenning, the film stars: Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Dwight Yoakam, Sam Shepard, Steve Zahn, and Denis Arndt. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously with a good bit of light humor and, as most of the reviewers here will agree, plenty of sex appeal.

Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Salma Hayek or Penelope Cruz.",1233705600,,1204,4.414414414414415
2684833,3,B000K7VHNW,"""Bandidas"" is set during the Mexican Revolution...

Cruz stars as Mara Alvarez, a gun-happy superstitious peasant who learns that her land has been sold to Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam) by a corrupt Mexican banker Don Diego Sandoval (Ismael 'East' Carlo) until some higher authority intercedes...

Mara always knew what she wants and she always knew she feels, however when she dared to accuse Don Carlos as a corrupt and a thief, as a result of that her father is wounded in his ranch and his house is burned to the ground...

Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek), who has been away at school in Europe for ten years, has left as a girl and came home as a woman...The only problem of Don Diego is now to convince her to stay... But Sandoval is poisoned following a real estate agreement with the avaricious Jackson...

So the two girls--joined by destiny--decide to be trained by Sam Shepard, to shoot well and to learn the rules of robbing banks... So they teamed up to get the people back on their land, and to come up with a plan, something that will benefit the people and destroy these murderers...

But after Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn) an expert from New York City is kidnapped by the two she-monsters, the ruthless Jackson brought in more reinforcements, real killers hunting the two girls like animals... So every bank was seen more guarded now... Sara saw herself desperate, running out of ideas... Inside of herself she knew that she was raised to be a spoiled lady, not a renegade...

Penlope and Salma have great chemistry, and they are totally adorable together... The film has many memorable moments: the church catfight; the horse climbing a ladder; the two beauties in prostitute red cloth; Hayek getting off her chest her bloody corset which has been squeezing her gut her whole life; Salma teaching Penlope how to kiss a man right and how to capture that nuance...",1232841600,,1874,4.75076923076923

I wouldn't want to spoil the delicious anticipation you'll feel especially since it will keep you tuned in when things get slow. I will say that the girls have a scene where, dressed as French show girls, Salma teaches Penelope how to kiss a man so that he'll never forget her. Also Penelope as a crack pistol shot is hot, and Salma as an expert with knives in even hotter. There's some kind of plot and cowboys and such although really this could have taken place in medieval Europe, feudal Japan or Jupiter's third moon (Ganymede smart guy!) and still have kept most of it's appeal. It was made mostly to get the two lovely stars together. And what a constellation they make! (Sorry!)

2684837,3,B000K7VHNW,"It's clich&eacute;-filled, but who cares?  Did you see the box cover?!  Every western has a few of the same scenes dressed up in a different manner depending on the cast.  Afterall, villians don't wear white, and there has never been a Hayak/Cruz in skimpy-clothing-and-Wonderbra movie of which I'm aware.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I was looking for some nudity going into this movie, and was disappointed in the fact that neither of the leading ladies lost any lingerie.  I thought that the cat-fight scene alone would be good for at least some gratuitous frontal nudity.  Considering the sexy box-cover, I feel that my disappointment is justified.  Afterall, it's clearly what they were attempting to use to sell the movie.

Maria (Penelope Cruz) and Sara (Salma Hayek) become improbable bank robbers - with tutelage from an old crook named Buck (Sam Shepard) - when brought together by tragedy.  One rich, Sara, and one poor, Maria, are polar opposites.  Initially they are naturally outwardly opposite of one another, and therefore enemies.  That all changes when each girl suffers through either a fatal or near-fatal family experience - a direct result of an evil railroad construction project planned to go straight through each girl's property; from there on out, they each have the same mission of revenge.

The rest of the movie is just a showcase for Hayak and Cruz, a reason to show them both off in attractive clothing and beautiful Mexican scenery, as they fight the apparently evil Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakum) and his bank/railroad enterprise.  But, really, it's just a reason to watch Hayak and Cruz get in a cat fight while wearing revealing clothing.  It's not a deep film, not an overly interesting plot, and it's not remotely close to winning any awards.  It's just an entertaining, perfect date movie - there's women empowerment for the ladies, and copious cleavage for the guys.",1211760000,2,1907,4.9905063291139244

There is one cat fight scene by the two ladies and one comic relief provided by ever-reliable Steve Zahn. You can say ""Bandidas"" is conventional and predictable and the film knows it. Still you just can't hate this film especially when two leading ladies are clearly having fun. So why shouldn't we?

""Bandida"" are about two Mexican women with opposite personalities Maria (Penlope Cruz) and Sara (Salma Hayek). When one of their father is killed, and the other heavily injured, by villainous Jackson (Dwight Yoakam) hired by a New York bank, the two women join hands to form a bank-robbing team for revenge. But of course, their first rule is, ""Don't kill anybody.""

Co-produced (and co-written) by Luc Besson, ""Bandidas"" is an old-school fun movie which doesn't take itself seriously. With the beautiful cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and the music by Eric Serra, both Besson's regular duo, the film is fun to watch though it could have been wackier or more action-paced than it is. Like many other films written by Besson (""TAXI"" series, for instance), the plot is very thin, allowing for the comical interplay between two main characters Penlope Cruz and Salma Hayek, always sexy and delightful.

Don't those gringos ever learn? Of course, there is a pair of brave Mexicans who stand up and fight against the gringos and ultimately become heroes of the people. The ""twist"" in this film is that our protagonists are two beautiful women (Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz  - Cruz is actually Spanish, but hey, Spaniard, Mexicans, same thing), an educated lady and an unsophisticated farmer's daughter, who turn to robbing banks after Hayek's father is murdered and Cruz's father turned away from his land.

""Bandidas"" is co-written and co-produced by Luc Besson and this is, most certainly, not Besson's best film (pick just about any film that he has written that stars Jean Reno and you will find a better film).  However, that didn't really bother me. Considering the fact that this movie went straight to DVD, I didn't expect very much of it. What this film is is entertaining fluff. This is not a life changing film; I will probably have forgotten everything about it by the end of the week; but for the 90 minutes that I spent watching it, I had a good time.

All of the actors in it are solid, A-list (or, at least, upper B-list) actors, who do good jobs in their respective roles (as well as Cruz and Hayek, the film also stars Steve Zahn, as a Sherlock Holmes-esque detective sent to catch the ""bandidas"", and Dwight Yokham as the head gringo villain). The plot is about as stupid and predictable as your average Western plot, and to make matters worse, we are expected to believe that both Cruz's and Hayek's characters are attracted to Zahn (yeah right).

2684843,3,B000K7VHNW,"Pairing Salma Hayek and Penlope Cruz in a campy, comic buddy western turns out to be a mildly amusing ploy, but I just wish this 2006 film had more true grit and a sharper sense of the characters than the screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen exhibits. As vividly beautiful as the two actresses are, together they are physically and temperamentally too similar to be credible opposites. They are both compelling enough presences onscreen, especially playing such self-sufficient women, but the lack of contrast makes it hard to think they are little more than two halves of the same character. They are guided by first-time filmmakers Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg, which may account for the lack of visual flair that Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino could have brought to the story. Regardless, the pacing is lightning-quick, and the cartoonish touches provide the requisite popcorn entertainment.

Set in turn-of-the-last-century Mexico, two women are leading separate lives - Sara Sandoval is the pampered, worldly daughter of a wealthy landowner, and Maria Alvarez is the dirt-poor farm girl who has relied on her horse sense and keen marksmanship. Their paths cross when seedy, bloodthirsty robber baron Tyler Jackson steals from their respective fathers and kills them both. Naturally, Sara and Maria seek revenge but must settle their own class-conflict squabbling first (via the inevitable cat-fighting scene). With the help of grizzled former bank robber Bill Buck, Sara and Maria become ""Las Bandidas"", Mexico's version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Things get complicated when Jackson hires New York criminologist Quentin Cooke to track down the women, but you can probably guess that Quentin succumbs to their ample charms. The script throws in some interesting economic theory discussions, but mostly flimsy excuses are made to insert some silly scenes like having the women dress as saloon prostitutes out of the Moulin Rouge to seduce Quentin.

Other than the mandatory gunplay, the elaborate stunts include a Tarzan-like use of a swinging chain, the creative use of ice skates during a heist, a slo-mo action scene that feels stolen from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>, and a paean to the famous river-jumping scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butch-Cassidy/dp/B000EXDS5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butch Cassidy</a>.

Set in 1880s Mexico, Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek), a banker's daughter, and Maria Alvarez (Penelope Cruz), a poor farmer's one, have nothing in common but their Mexican heritage and a desire for revenge on the American railroad interests who've sent a thug named Tyler Jackson (played country music superstar Dwight Yoakam) to steal the locals' land, and in the process kill Sara's father and seriously injure Maria's.

You'll have to do much suspension of disbelief and be in a goofy mood for this movie:
On the run from Jackson's men, Sara and Maria enlist the services of veteran bankrobber (Sam Shepard) to teach them all that he knows.  Afterwards and bumbling their way through holdups, the ladies attempt to blackmail a Sherlock Holmes wannabe NYPD detective (an extremely miscast Steve Zahn), who is also the fiance of the railroad owner's daughter; however, being at heart nice sweet gals, Sara and Maria instead resort to a much more effective style of 'friendly persuasion' to enlist the dorky-but-crafty New York cop.

Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), Steve Zahn, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all good.

Bandidas is probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, and though quite silly at times, it will put you in a good mood and provide for an evening's entertainment.",1179792000,,742,4.514925373134329
2684854,5,B000K7VHNW,"I expected a reasonably funny film with it's two very attractive leading ladies, what you get is almost a farce in that the action scenes are unlikely; but no more so silly than in the so called serious action films which Hollywood produces every day.

What you do get is a lot of hilarious interplay between the various characters as they progress from being third grade bank robbers into second grade bank robbers.

A treat for fans of Penelope, Salma and Luc Besson.",1176854400,,469,4.63855421686747
2684855,4,B000K7VHNW,"This movie was so cute and funny.  I adore Selma Hayek anyway, but these two made a great team.  Humor and action along the lines of ""The Mask of Zorro"".  The kissing scene with a naked Steve Zahn was absolutely hilarious.  I highly recommend this film if you're looking for great entertainment and some touching moments mixed with very funny stuff.",1174435200,,349,4.672131147540983
2684856,5,B000K7VHNW,"I gave this movie five stars because if you are considering purchasing it, you obviously have serious issues.  Just kidding.  If you are considering buying this movie, you are doing it for the same reason I did... you find Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz very attractive.  If you are looking for a movie with lots of scenes of Salma and Penelope running around in cute outfits and looking gorgeous, this is the movie for you.  However, if you are looking for a non-chiche movie with a brilliant plot and great acting, this isn't the movie for you.  I assume you are looking at this movie for the former reason, not the latter, which is why I gave it five stars.",1174089600,3,659,4.458333333333333
2684857,5,B000K7VHNW,"This is an excellent light hearted comedy / action film. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek team up as partner ""cowboys"" robbing banks to avenge robbery and murder and there is great interaction between them. The bonus is that they are gorgeous. Steve Zahn becomes their lucky accomplice, which man wouldn't have liked to play his role ?

The editing is slick and the fast pace never falters. There are snippets of appropriate classical music in the score which enhances the already lively sound track. The widescreen format is well used in the open landscapes and the moving camera gives a new dimension to the picture.

I see that the film never had a nationwide studio release and it is certainly not heard of in the UK, what a shame !",1173830400,,733,4.630769230769231
2684858,4,B000K7VHNW,"Bandidas is a movie that was originally supposed to get a nationwide studio release, but that never happened, so now moviegoers will have to buy the DVD of a surprisingly good movie.  The movie tells the story of Sara, a rich spoiled girl, and Maria, a poor farmhand who lives with her father.  A New York banking company arrives in the area trying to acquire land and bank rights  in hopes of building a railroad through Mexico.  In the process, Sara's father is killed and Maria's is wounded.  The two women from completely different backgrounds team up and begin robbing those banks, Sara for revenge and Maria to give the land and money back to the people.  The plot is pretty simple, but this movie is entertaining throughout.  The main reason most people will pick this up is because Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek in a western doesn't sound too shabby, and they're right.  Both women are incredibly gorgeous and the script gives them several chances to show off their ""talents.""  But even more than that, Bandidas is funny with some pretty well-done action scenes that will keep your attention throughout.  Too few westerns are released nowadays, so don't let this one slip by.

  Sharing top billing, Cruz and Hayek play Maria and Sara, the two women from opposite sides of the track who team up to rob banks.  As mentioned, these women are gorgeous, but they seem to be having a genuinely good time and it shows in the final product.  The movie also gives them a chance to show off their comedic chops and do some fun action scenes that movie fans might not have seen before.  Steve Zahn, the lucky man that he is, costars as Quentin, a crime scene analyst (think 19th century CSI) who finds himself on the side of the bandidas while they fight over him.  Zahn is very good in the part, and steals some scenes with his facial expressions alone.  Dwight Yoakam plays Jackson, the lowly bank representative trying to hunt down and capture Maria and Sara.  And in a small part, Sam Shepard takes the part of Bill Buck, a grizzled old bank robber himself who teaches Maria and Sara the ""rules"" of robbing a bank.  The DVD offers a good commentary from stars Hayek and Cruz, a 5-minute featurette with interviews from the duo about the making of the movie, and a theatrical trailer.  So overall, don't be scared away that Bandidas is a straight-to-video release.  It has plenty of action, humor, and two gorgeous leading ladies.  Don't miss Bandidas!",1173744000,4,2453,4.653488372093023
2684859,4,B000K7VHNW,"Starting from ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", and continuing on through ""The Mexican"" and ""Three Amigos"", Hispanic actors have either taken the role of bad guy, or innocent bystander in Western / cowboy movies.  Hispanic actresses were often absent altogether, or were relegated to non-action roles.  Even the Zorro movies employ the Welsh actress, Caterina Zeta-Jones, to play the lead female role.  This tradition might explain why this movie flopped in the US theaters.  Starring the top two Hispanic actresses in Hollywood, this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable, much more so than is reflected by the viewing it received on the big screen.  The movie is about two daughters from different sides of town who end up forming a team to avenge their losses at the hands of the henchman of the Bank of New York.  Along the way, they pick up the help of an American criminal investigator by the name of Quinten Cooke.  Both women can and do kick butt in the Wild West, each in their own way.  One is a dead shot and the other is a skilled knife-thrower.  Both are also great on horseback and in hand-to-hand combat.

This movie is a combination of action, comedy, and Western.  There is some romantic comedy, but no pure romance.  It is great for family viewing, and the only nudity in the movie is shot of Steve Zahn's buttocks.  Maybe shots of the two lead actresses' buttocks might have helped the movie's takes on the big screen.  Overall, it is great viewing for the entire family and the action is fairly tamed compared to what is seen on TV.",1173657600,,1555,4.627737226277373
2684860,3,B000K7VHNW,"Steve Zahn, in a scene stealing role, adds some much needed credibility to this romp. Admit it, Selma Hayek is a goddess, and to match her with Penelope Cruz should be an instant success, but unfortunately the story was not well-written enough to carry the strength of these two screen mavens. I love it for the campiness of it (""We were discussing theology.""), but if you're looking for top dollar, this isn't the best spend, If you have room for fun and just a ride in the wilderness with some wonderful actresses, then this is your pic of the week.",1173312000,,551,4.52
2684861,5,B000K7VHNW,"Salma and Penelope play two women from completely different backgrounds. When they are forced to rob banks together to help the Mexican people fight against some bad guys, the two women must learn to deal with their vast differences and work together. This western is delightful because it has a comic element with some very fresh antics. Dwight Yoakam makes a fantastic bad guy in this movie (I didn't recognize him at first with all that hair and a mustache), and even the horses are talented. This western is amusing, clean enough for family viewing, and has a happy ending.

If you like comic westerns, (like Blazing Saddles), action movies, or movies with beautiful women.  Then you should give then you should give Bandidas a try.

The movie also features, Steve Zahn from (That Thing You Do).

Also, be sure to listen to the audio commentary in some ways.  It's even funnier than the movie.",1170288000,2,482,4.546511627906977
2684865,5,B000K7VHNW,"If you like action movies with comedy, you'll like this.  I liked Salma Hayek's performance in Ugly Betty, so I picked this up at the video store.  It's basically a cowboy movie set in Mexico, with Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz as the partner cowboys robbing banks to save their people.  I thought the action and comedy were really well done.  Salma Hayek is a rich heiress, newly returned from a European education to her banker father's Mexican home.  Penelope Cruz is a Mexican farm girl with an affinity for horses and guns. Some bad guys come into the story and force the farmers to sell their farms for 1 peso, or be shot (or both).  Salma and Penelope's fathers get murdered/injured by the bad guys and the two ladies go on the road for some revenge.  They rob the bad guy's banks and give the money to support the displaced Mexican people.  Salma and Penelope get training in bank robbing, come up with some hilarious schemes to rob armed banks, and even get the crime scene investigator to help them rob banks.  The story is set in a beautiful Mexican (I think it's actually shot entirely in Mexico) landscape where the people are good and honest, and the bad guys are out to swindle them.  Salma and Penelope, needless to say, are beautiful and hilarious.  Their outfits are particularly attractive and they have some great comedic stunts.  There's one part that's probably not suitable for children though - at one point the two ladies dress up in brothel dance outfits and take scandalous photos with a unclothed bound man (for purely blackmail purposes).  There's a cute dog, a smart horse who can even go up ladders, and lots of beautiful shots of scenery, horses and great music.  The movie has a lot of slapstick comedy, two heart-of-gold heroines who bicker with each other, and enough action (gunfights, explosions and horse riding) to keep my husband happy. If you're looking for a comedic action movie with heart in a beautiful historical setting, this is it.",1169942400,26,1979,4.698550724637681
2684866,3,B000K7VHNW,"So just how far down do you wanna go where we can talk it out over a cup of Joe and you can stare deep into my eyes like I was a Supermodel.  Oops, that's the opening to The Refreshments Banditos.  That's not to be confused with the little seen Bandidas.  Of course Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz don't really scream comedy gold.  But oddly this buddy flick works being at the very least entertaining.  Although this asks the question, if the two leads are female, should it instead be called a gal pal flick?  Obviously the name ""chick flick"" is already taken for a different genre.

The film takes place in the turn of the century Mexico where an evil land baron (is there any other kind), played by Dwight Yoakam (Friday Night Lights, the movie not television show), is doing everything he needs to do get a railroad built across the country.  He also did some nefarious deeds to get control of the local banks for us Yankees.  Two of his targets include a farmer and the owner of various properties who both get shot by his hand.  This leads the daughter of the farmer (Cruz) and property owner (Hayek) to rob the same bank in revenge not knowing the other had the same plan.  But under the tutelage of famous bank robber Sam Shepard (The Notebook) they learn to trust each other (don't they always).

With comedy not being their forte, the girls bring in Steve Zahn (Sahara) to play up the laughs as a clumsy but brilliant criminal investigator (is there any other kind) brought in by Yoakam to catch the Bandidas.  Unfortunately Zahn is responcible for the only nude scene in the movie despite the massive amount of cleavage throughout.  And it's that cleavage that helps them take Zahn a hostage not as if any red blooded male wouldn't willing go with Hayek and Cruz.  Hilarity ensues, much of which is predictable and clichd but the movie still is worth the time f you have an hour and a half to spare.",1169942400,2,1909,4.461095100864553
2684867,3,B000K7VHNW,"Considering the two movie stars that headline this project, it is somewhat surprising that 20th Century Fox decided to quietly release Bandidas straight to video in North America. While Salma Hayek is not the box office draw she once was, her co-star Penelope Cruz is red hot right now thanks to an excellent performance in Pedro Almodovar's Volver. Bandidas is essentially a popcorn movie that would be ideal for mainstream, multiplex audiences so what's the deal?

Bandidas trots out the usual clichs: the ornery horse, the bickering heroes (including the obligatory catfight), the despicable villain dressed in black, a mangy yet lovable dog sidekick and plenty of slapstick that is predictably broad and downright silly in nature.

But let's face it, you're not watching Bandidas for thoughtful character development but rather for the lovely leading ladies who have pretty decent chemistry together but are let down by the clich-ridden (even by Luc Besson's standards), pedestrian screenplay. Cruz and Hayek provide the requisite eye candy but much to the dismay of their male fans the only nudity is courtesy of Steve Zahn. One wonders what this film would have been like in the capable hands of someone like Robert Rodriguez who has an innate understanding and knowledge of how genre films work but then again, he's already visited this kind of material with his Mariachi trilogy which were essentially modern westerns. That being said, Bandidas is pleasant enough if not an instantly forgettable time waster.

There is an audio commentary by Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz. It is pretty obvious from the way they talk to each other - the familiarity and casual shorthand - that they have been good friends for years. Hayek proudly says that they shot the entire movie in Mexico and she even points out the various locations. There are occasional lulls on this track but they aren't too long as the two women recount anecdotes about filming and praise certain cast and crew members. Like the movie itself, this is a pleasant enough track but hardly essential listening.

""Burning Up the Set with Salma and Penelope"" is a standard promotional featurette. They talk about their characters and the story with several clips from the movie peppered throughout this extra.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1168992000,4,2313,5.092348284960422
