8286285,5,B0001X06BY,"this was my introduction to one of the coolest 80s cartoons EVER!

It's four music videos combined with the three past Raccoons specials--""The Raccoons' Christmas"", ""The Raccoons on Ice"", and ""The Raccoons and the Lost Star"". That's all I have to say for now about it.

In the meantime, I'll be on the lookout for the other three specials (on LimeWire, which I occasionally use). But for the rest of you Raccoons fans, good luck finding them elsewhere!",1140134400,,452,4.782051282051282
