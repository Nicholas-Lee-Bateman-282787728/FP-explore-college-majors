Punk Revolution NYC: The Velvet Underground, The New York Dolls & The CBGB Set is a detailed, diligent and dynamic 2 DVD box.
Disc One is a riveting document on the arrival of The Velvet Underground and their immense influence on contemporary culture. From their early associations with Andy Warhol and his empire this iconic New York institution made an indelible mark on many musicians that followed. From an unlikely bond between Lou Reed and Welsh wizard John Cale the Velvets early development was enhanced with the addition of Stirling Morrison and Moe Tucker. From this point a truly original quartet was formed and modern music was kick started!
There is an astute analysis from those in the inner circle plus associates and journalists. The resulting assessment dissects the scene, the sounds and the evolving freedom of 60s expression that took Reed and his cohorts down a different route to the seemingly dominant peace and love population identified with west coast America. What becomes apparent is the colossus of creativity that sprung forth and even though the emphasis changed when Cale left and Doug Yule stepped in there was still a great deal to champion.
Disc Two moves on from the Velvet Underground template and assesses what followed in terms of the acts that catapulted from a 70s Big Apple. From this point we are introduced to the likes of the New York Dolls, Television, The Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, The Ramones, Talking Heads, Suicide, Blondie, Patti Smith and a cast of other integers. The footage makes for essential viewing and this experience does offer a cast of characters that were to the fore during the rise of rebel rock in a cross section of outlets such as the renowned CBGBs and Mercer Arts Center.
This a thorough account of an exuberant era that changed the sonic landscape not just in America but globally. The venues, the vehemence, the vitality and the variety make for a tantalising tale. As a viewer please buy in to this bounty because it gives the flavour of a fertile sonic city in its productive prime.",1465948800,,2120,4.899721448467966
8473605,5,B005HSP7AS,A very good film set about the US Punk scene and the CBGBs club where it all started. Great footage and interviews.,1459641600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8473606,5,B005HSP7AS,"This 3-plus hour documentary is the best you can get on this subject. Though it has some footage of the bands and performers, it is around 75 percent interviews with either members of the bands or music journalists; around 20 people in all. The NYC bands here, particularly Velvet Underground, New York Dolls and Ramones, were truly revolutionary, and changed the face of music; influencing bands up to this day. This dvd gives a great history and overview of these bands, as well as Television, Blondie, Suicide, Talking Heads, and Patti Smith.
  I would like to have seen more on the Heartbreakers , Jayne/Wayne County's 2 bands, Dead Boys, and the Cramps, ( the Cramps seem to have been written out of this scene which they were a part of).
  Still, one cannot complain about this totally fantastic, educational and intelligent movie. If you are interested in these bands and the NYC music scene, this is essential viewing!!",1455321600,2,927,4.848101265822785

8473609,5,B005HSP7AS,"Anyone who, like me, began buying albums by CBGBs artists in
the late 1970s as a teenager, or might not have been around at the
time and would like the information provided on the era, as well as
it's roots in the Velvet Underground and glitter rock scene, should
appreciate this DVD.
  One caveat: none of the performance footage is provided un-
interrupted by narration. But I didn't mind as I have vintage
 performances by many of these acts on other DVDs. A gem.",1408406400,5,466,4.523809523809524
8473610,5,B005HSP7AS,"Clearly traces the roots of 1970s NYC punk from the juxtaposition of campy drag shows, the folk/avant garde scenes, and Andy Warhol at the beginning of the decade to the unique and diverse groups that emerged from CBGBs at the end of the decade, such as The Ramones, The Talking Heads, and Blondie.  Also included were bands I'd never heard of, such as Suicide and Television, who didn't make it commercially but who went on to influence many musicians in a wide range of musical genres. I highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in how art/poetry/music can be intertwined to create new social and artistic movements. Also, anyone interested in the roots of New Wave and/or 1980s rock and roll.",1385769600,5,703,4.809917355371901
8473611,5,B005HSP7AS,"This is a very well made in depth look at the NYC music scene of the 70's.  It is very much in the vein of Clinton Heylin's book ""From the Velvets to the Voidoids"" in that it favors the more artistic bands like Television and Patti Smith whereasThe Heartbreakers are only spoken of in regard to Richard Hell and the Dead Boys are seen onscreen as the narrator references a ""second wave"" of bands but their name isn't spoken nor is their music heard.  But if that doesn't turn you off then this is definitely worth seeing.",1385251200,5,521,4.360824742268041
