8328445,5,B001NZ2OGO,I am a huge RJ fan...it's a great perspective piece. The dvd shipped quick and the price was right. Kudos to all!,1331942400,,113,4.181818181818182
8328446,1,B001NZ2OGO,This video is somewhat of huge let down if one is expecting race footages of the man who has changed in some ways the supercross scene and sadly he was not able to stay longer due to a silly injury.. The interviews are all nice and well.. But it would have been a great must have if there were some footages of races.. Why not publish a book instead ? Anyway.. For the die hard fans of RJ..  Most probably a must have.. But for those who are merely interested in RJ's career.. Wait till RJ will publish his biography..,1280620800,,518,4.18
8328447,5,B001NZ2OGO,Over 3 hours of extras on this dvd. I would recommend this if you like to follow old school motocross. It tells his whole life from a kid to the present stage of his life. Bonus interviews also with Bob Hannah and others. The Motocross files dvd's are awesome.,1261958400,,260,4.326530612244898
