7441670,4,B015I1461E,"Glad to have this movie on Blu Ray!

This is awesome to have on Blu Ray finally. That being said, it is missing scenes in this version. A shorter version of the film. The extras are cool. But a little lite for a Scream Factory release. I did a full in depth review for this film on YouTube. Look up ""The Looney Box"" channel. You will find it there!",1464220800,,348,4.043478260869565
7441671,5,B015I1461E,this movie just brought back so many memories...  Love it..,1460678400,,59,4.9
7441672,3,B015I1461E,"I remember those GARBAGE PAIL KIDS stickers and trading collectibles... never knew about this until it
was recommended by AmazonDotCom as being something I'd be interested in. I bought it, and am first to
say it DID NOT win any Academy Awards, but it sure as hell made me squirt milk out my nose while I was
watching it!
This is like---remember HOWARD THE DUCK?---SO0o horrible you'll have to watch it in two-parts. It's 30-
years old, filmed ""in-camera"" and contains what it LOOKS: little-people wearing big-head-masks, the size of
PUMPKINS!",1458345600,5,542,4.967032967032967
7441673,5,B015I1461E,The garbage pail kids is a classic film that deserves too be on blu ray the first time i saw it was on VHS at a friends house so then i went to my local video store and they had it in their previously viewed videos for sale so then i picked it up for 2 bucks but the tape was old so then i got the DVD when it came out on DVD but now i can get it on blu ray in which a lot of people can now see it with their familys because this film isn't well known.,1455840000,,452,3.4411764705882355

8733657,5,B015I1461E,Quality is good. Great movie very cool costumes. Interesting cast interviews.  Not too much as far as special features but the movie is entertaining enough.,1531785600,,156,5.24
8733658,5,B015I1461E,"Silly live action film edition of ""the Garbage Pail Kids"" cartoon characters.  The live action cartoon characters's heads are puppet heads that required off camera manipulation for facial expressions.  $$$ and not enough rehearsal time prevented a fully defined puppet facial animation to each garbage pail kid... But never mind that, since the story scenario skips along as the characters develop. Actually, as the film unspools, facial animation improves as the puppeteers gain traction in learning to make their ""KIDS"" express in facial expressions!  Production values are imaginative and interesting considering the project was filmed in a San Fernando Off Sepulveda Boulevard warehouse - where the sets were constructed. Just sit back and have a few chuckles with these bratty garbage pail kid round-UP.",1508457600,,808,5.5
8733659,5,B015I1461E,"Oh gods this film is as bad as I remember, but that makes it oh so fun. I'm just glad it's not like that Ring movie I watched 5 days ago. I couldn't imagine getting creepy phone calls from this film just for watching it.",1505260800,,220,3.911111111111111

8733663,3,B015I1461E,"A bit pricey for what you get here, but it's a decent collector's edition I guess.  The picture is so so, and there is an array of interviews, though not extensive, and doesn't say that it's been remastered (seems to be the original master used for the DVD from years back).",1479168000,2,274,4.372549019607843
8733664,4,B015I1461E,Good movie....lots of goofy fun!,1474329600,,32,5.6
8733665,3,B015I1461E,"This will be about the special features. They consist of interviews from cast & crew. Though these are light hearted, they don't really give any horror stories of making the picture other than it being real hot on set in the warehouse. Nothing really shocking or any feuds behind the scenes for a bomb like this. Seemed like they had a nice time. Mildly entertaining interviews though.",1470355200,2,385,4.7611940298507465
