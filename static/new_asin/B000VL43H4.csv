8219273,3,B000VL43H4,"First of all this is not a horror movie witch might be indicated from the title, it is drama. It is about a group of young Arabians that get their love lives influenced by playing with an Ouija board. The story is long drawn, following the fortunes and misfortunes of these kids after the Ouija game as the events the board foretold slowly take place and the movie moves painfully slow towards it's tragic end. All in all the movie is good, though some of that might come from the fact I think it is interesting with an Arabic movie, to get a glance into another culture, but the story is not that bad, but the film move extremely slow and I got bad after a while. But if you like Arabic movies or paranormal romance this movie is worth a look.",1232928000,,744,4.246478873239437
