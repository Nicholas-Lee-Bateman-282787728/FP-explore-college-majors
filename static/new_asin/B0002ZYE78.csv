8035539,5,B0002ZYE78,"First off,  I have to say that I bought this because I was bored on a Memorial Day weekend.  Boy, am I glad I did.  While my taste tends to run to teenage-soap-opera parodies and comedies (I'm 44 and my girlfriend wonders about this), this is engrossing--and really funny.  Early on, we learn of Yakamo Mutsu (whose first name sounds like the Italian Giacomo), who is a happy-go-lucky guy who just so happens to be the finest fighter in the land.  (One wonderful scene; when he's given his choice of weapons, he chooses a wooden dumpling skewer.)  I've been through the third DVD of this series, and it interestingly jumps generations; his son Takato is later featured, with many of the amusing idiosyncrasies of his father.  On the surface, the action is quite serious; however, the light touches really give this series some great moments.  Most of all, the blooper track on every DVD is a scream--they really have fun with the over-seriousness of the millieu.  Buy this and its sequels; it's not your father's samurai epic.  I only wish they had included a commentary, because the English voice actors were clearly having a good time.",1117324800,5,1137,4.755102040816326
8035540,5,B0002ZYE78,"The main character in this anime reminds me quite a bit of vash the stampede. His carefree attitude, his deceptive naivety, his appetite. The drawing is done very well and the characters are

introduced very nicely. The first disc gives you a taste and leaves you with wanting more.

I'm not sure what else to really say. The main character uses a fighting style that doesn't utilize the sword to defeat his enemy. And while surrounded and out numbered by armed ninja, samurai, or other sword masters, his style gives him a destinct advantage.

I guess the nicest thing is it has ninja, samurai, and martial arts without the level of violence with samurai x, ninja resurrection, or etc. Its all done very artfully and the most blood I've seen is a little splatter. Which makes it an excellent candidate for my kids. (which they've seen this disc and enjoyed it).

If the other discs are as good as this first offering, I'll be adding this series to my collection.",1116374400,2,963,4.647058823529412
8035541,5,B0002ZYE78,When I picked up this anime I thought it would pass the time didn't expect it to be so great. Storytelling is excellent as they come. If you liked Rurouni Kenshin series then this will Fill the void that series left do to it being over.  As with Kenshin it is more of a story series with action to draw you in.  So far it seams not many has yet to find this great gem. Shura No Toki has turned out  how I wished the Ninja Scroll series would have. It just that Great. The worst thing I can say about this series is that the release dates for the next volume are to far apart.,1110326400,5,575,3.939655172413793
8035542,5,B0002ZYE78,"I saw this anime a few months ago as a fansub straight from japan.  I loved it immediately because it has very fluid animation, likable characters, good music, a great storyline, and much more. Awesome fights are abundand in this show and a lot of famous people from japanese history (and some other animes) are present as well.  One aspect of this show that makes it rather different is how the storyline flows.  The start of the story is as the description says.  However, after the initial story arc is complete, the story skips ahead some years and follows yakumo's son who is a grown man.  After following him through some adventures, it moves forward again.  I only saw about 20 of the episodes and i believe it jumped about 3 or 4 times. I really liked this anime and would definately recommend it to someone who is a fan of action/historical anime.  Enjoy ^^",1099353600,6,866,4.548387096774194
