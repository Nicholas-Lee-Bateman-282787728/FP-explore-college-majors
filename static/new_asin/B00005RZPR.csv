1658459,5,B00005RZPR,"Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team is one of if not the best Gundam series out there, and this final DVD to wrap it up is by far the most action-packed. In Episode 10, Norris Packard goes head-on against the whole 08th MS Team in his heavily armed & formitable looking Gouf Custom. This is my favorite of all the 08th MS episodes purely for the battle sequences and the emotional interaction between Norris and Aina. This gives you the feel for the more undeveloped character of Norris, the stead-fast retainer of the Sakhalin family, and somewhat of a father in Aina's eyes. Combined with the master artwork and along wtih Episodes 11 & 12, Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team Volume 4 is a DVD you must own a experience for yourself.",1006560000,8,738,4.474074074074074
1658460,5,B00005RZPR,"I'm used to watching Gundam Wing, which I saw on Toonami.  I thought it was one of the best series.  I've seen every Gundam Wing episode and I even own the Endless Waltz movie.  I was mad when they stopped showing it but my friend told me about Mobile Suit Gundam:08th MS Team and I thought it wasn't even going to compare.  Well, I'm rarely as wrong as I was when I made that statement!!!!  I liked it much better than Gundam Wing.  In the action department it is lacking compared to Gundam Wing but it has a much better storyline and I love they way they depend much more one their mobile suits unlike Gundam Wing.  It seems much more realistic than Gundam Wing.
  In the begining of the series the main character Sheero is trapped in an abandoned space ship with a woman from the enemy military, Zeon.  The two escape together and through the whole series there is an unmistakable romance.  I liked this series much better than Gundam Wing.  If you don't want to get it because it doesn't have as much fighting, trust me, you'll get more than enough.  The only problem with this series is that it's not long enough, but that means it won't cost as much:)",1006387200,3,1157,4.350467289719626

7953057,5,B00005RZPR,"Taking place in the year Universal Century 0079 (Same time as the original ""Mobile Suit Gundam"") Mobile Suit Gundam: 8th Mobile Suit Team tells the story of Shiro Armada and his team of Mobile Suit Pilots, for those wondering 8th MS is a great thing to watch if you are just now getting into Gundam. Now most Gundam series tell the story of a 15 year old Dragged into the war and how he and his friends win the war, 8th ms team is the opposite, it actually documents what the ""regular"" people were like in the time, they use regular robots that do not have the power to take down an entire fleet, and they fight against other regular robots like ""Zaku II's"". With that said you get to watch the team do various operations, like freeing a town from the control of ZEON, or doing stuff in the desert. One scene I really like is a scene where they are actually preforming maintence on a robot, scenes like this actually imerese the viewer in the feeling that this is what being a soilder is like.
The characters also have human sides, Shiro is trying to prove himself and keep his dysfunctional team intact, Micheal (Spelling) is suffering the woes of a long distance relationship, and there are many other characters with ""human"" problems, the characters also are not imortal, there are times when their MS get destroyed, and they get injured. There is also a love story, which I find rather interesting, because it has that whole ""Two soilders on different sides fall in love."" feel.
Would I suguest it? YES! to everyone. 8th ms team really shows what it would be like to be a grunt in the earth federation army, and also has a nice love story in it.",1084579200,,1649,4.445544554455446
7953058,5,B00005RZPR,"The classic elements are there: innocent love between enemies that overcomes the trials and tribulations of war and defeats an evil force.
Animation is quite good, and frankly, I find the plot and dialogue more plausible than any other Gundam series. Consider, for instance that the 08th MS Team is a group of earth-bound fighters. Technically, these guys wouldn't last against the new-types out in space. But, then again I thought the new-types like Gundam Wing fighters or Kou and Gato in 0083, who fly mobile suits at lightning speeds, were too fantastic. Not so with the 08th team. Shiro is definitely a personable and likeable character; he is mortal and he fights human enemies.
The drama that engulfs brewing evil force in the form of a new weapon, is the love story between Shiro and Aina. Against all odds, the two enemies end up together after a battle and fall in (or confess their) love. As a true testament to this love, the two would willingly sacrifice their lives to destroy the new weapon.",1073606400,2,1006,4.7542857142857144
7953059,5,B00005RZPR,"At the end of the last episode, we find that Aina and Shiro are alive and well...and Aina looks to be pregnant (gee, who saw THAT coming?)
  The first two espiodes is a two-parter and is the final battle between the Federation and the Zeon.  I either didn't see the very last espiode (""Last Resort"")  on Cartoon Network or they didn't show it at all.  On the Cartoon Network version, it isn't clear in Aina and Shiro survived the battle, as Miguel (spelling?) tells us that he never saw the two again.  However, i am very happy for Aina and Shiro.  Love knows no bounds (or sides in a war).  A great ending to a great series!",1035763200,3,625,4.282051282051282
7953060,5,B00005RZPR,"Often when an anime series becomes wildly popular, it spawns several sequels, spin offs, and other such things.  The ""mobile Suit Gundam"" series is one of those series.  It's been around for 20 years and shows no signs of stopping.  But can an anime so amazing transcend through time and still manage to keep the same themes without becoming cliche and also be fresh?  Yes, yes it can.  And ""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"" is proof.
  ""8th MS Team"" is one of the many Gundam titles that Bandai has released as part of it's Gundam invasion.  The 12-episode OVA series came out in 1996 and takes place in the year U.C. 0079 of the Gundam Timeline.  The story chronicles the story of Fedearation pilot, Lt. Shiro Amada and his team of Mobile Suit pilots as they try to survive the remainder of the One-Year War.  But Shiro's fate is altered by the war when he falls in love with a Zeon pilot named Aina Sahalin.  How can love survive in a battlefield filled with hatred?  Watch and see.
  Unlike other Gundam series, that often involve dynamic battles that take place on both Earth and in space, ""08th MS Team"" strictly remains within the imposing environments of South-East Asia.  Also, unlike the wildly popular ""Gundam Wing,"" the Mobile Suits in this series are not shown as celestial gods, but what they were originally intended to be; war machines.  The Gundams in this series are treated more like tanks and airplanes rather than ""the ultimate harbringers of death"" like in many anime series featuring giant robots, a staple theme in the Gundam series.
  The story is well-done and brings a new-light on the Gundam story from 20 years ago.  The events in this story take place at roughly the same time the events in Mobile Suit Gundam take place.  Having the story take place on the neglected Earth battlefield allows for a perspective that does not screw up the Gundam history (*cough cough* Stardust Memory *cough cough*) and at the same time allows for something new.
  The characters are very interesting.  As with most of the Gundam series, watching the characters interact with one another is just as amazing as watching the Mobile Suits battle.  Each character has his or her own dillema and manages to develop themselves as better characters through out the entire series.  This is possibly one of the best cast acts seen in any anime, almost surpassing that of ""Fushigi Yuugi's"" and ""Patlabor's,"" and that is a lot.
  The animation is also extraordinary, there is rarely a dull moment in the action portrayed on screen.  And since the series is only 12 episodes long, it allows for animation that can rival most Hollywood movies.  It also allows for no re-used scenes in any of the action sequences, which anime like ""Dargon Ball Z"" and ""Ronin Warriors"" has become so fond of doing.
  The music is also well-orchestrated and paced in quite well with the rest of the series.  True, although it's not the amazing pieces created by Two Mix for ""Gundam Wing,"" it's still something you would want to hum to when in the car.
  My only gripe with this series is that it leaves a few things up in the air as far as backgrounds go.  Sometimes, I wondered more about the deeper stories the characters have to tell, I'm quite sure they are as interesting as the main story.  Well, it IS a 12-episode OAV so there is not enough time to dive into every one's stories, but it's still a wanted addition that would have probably enhanced the series.
  Also, if someone doesn't know what a Zaku or a Gouf is, then they will be left in the dark as to some of the terminology used in the series.  Luckily, DVD's 2, 3, 4 have bonus clips and MS Encyclopedia's under their extras that will turn a beginner in the Gundam universe into a Mobile Suit Master.
  In the end, ""The 08th MS Team"" is a highly reccomended anime, and a must-have for any fan of Gundam, as well as a must-have for anyone who fancy's themself a Gundam-head.  This series will want you to suit-up...again...and again...and again...

7953061,5,B00005RZPR,"08th MS Team is probably one of the best Gundam OVA and best side story for Mobile Suit Gundam(not talking about Gundam Wing).
Unlike Gundam Wing where the Gundams are almost invincible and the pilots are perfect, this has mass production Gundams which are much weaker and have more of a military look and the pilots are just soldiers of the Earth Federation fighting the Zeons. 08th MS Team includes the best that Gundam has to offer. This DVD is the last one in the 08th MS Team OVA and includes the Final episode named ""Last Resort"" which Cartoon Network did not show. So if you want to know what happened to Shiro and Aina you should buy it.",1024185600,,645,4.428571428571429
7953062,4,B00005RZPR,"Well, I was wrong about my prediction that the lost subplot from episode 8 would be somehow reincorporated into these last episodes. Now I am simply confused as to why something would be shown on television (good ol' Toonami) but be cut from the DVD! On the whole, I suppose  the subplot was not immensely important, but it did bridge a few plot gaps and give some very deep insights into the characters (especially Shiro and Commander Kojima).
But enough about that...
Those lost fifteen minutes of story have been completely compensated for by the addition of an entire 30 minutes of conclusion! The 13th episode, ""Last Resort"" barred from television due to its grisly war-imagery and extended nude sequence. I'm almost sorry to say I found myself laughing at the beginning of the episode, as we see Michel and Kiki making their way down the river in a boat and with Michel giving a voiceover straight out of APOCALYPSE NOW! I suppose they have a similar premise: an insightful search for a man who defied all odds and struck out on his own to find peace and happiness. Of course, this offers a slightly more positive view than A.N., with Shiro lacking the God-complex of Marlon Brando.
This is a heartwarming, tearjerking little story of the true horrors of war as it can only be told...through the children. But not just any children; these are the children of the Flanagan Agency! The human manifestation of all the Nuremberg scientists put into one callous, evil form that-dare I say-puts Commandante Ginias to shame!
And of course I cannot give this volume its due praise without mentioning everyone's favourite Zeke-Weapons: The Gouf Custom and the Dom! Norris is truly a force to be reckoned with!
But the best part about the volume is that it is the end! I know that sounds like I'm glad the series is over. On the contrary, I cannot wait for the movie to be released to DVD (called Miller's Report). I am just saying that anyone can build up a plot and get everyone to shift themselves closer to the edge of the seats, but to actually carry out the climax and the falling action and resolution takes far greater skill. This achieves this goal to such a glorious extent that I can only attach the title of ""gifted"" to this series' staff! MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM is truly a timeless classic.",1011916800,5,2295,4.652709359605911
