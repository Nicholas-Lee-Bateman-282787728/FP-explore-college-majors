6123757,5,B00GXKOZO8,"This is by far one of the better sets in his series, completely changed my game. I love the theory, explanation and detail behind each technique.",1389744000,4,145,4.615384615384615

6123765,5,B00GXKOZO8,Best Guard Passing Series Out There.,1429574400,,36,5.166666666666667
6123766,5,B00GXKOZO8,Awsome detail Ryan. Ryan always has the best dad's.  This is more conceptual rather than techniques.,1429315200,,100,5.25
6123767,5,B00GXKOZO8,Great Price. Quick Shipping. I loved the instructional. Well worth the money. I'd buy from here again.,1425600000,,102,5.0588235294117645
6123768,5,B00GXKOZO8,"I've purchased all of Ryan Hall's dvds, each one has helped me drastically improve my game, both in competing and in teaching. His passing system is much more then a collection of techniques, but is technical breakdown of how the technique works, why it works and will guide you into a deeper understanding of passing so you can make your own game out of this. Imagine if you Ryan Hall was your personal jiu jitsu tutor and developed a study guide on passing just for you. It would look like this dvd series.",1424217600,9,508,4.473118279569892
6123769,5,B00GXKOZO8,"Awesome price and always great instruction from Ryan Hall.  Have ordered from World Martial Arts many times, and will continue to in the future!",1422748800,,144,5.0
6123770,5,B00GXKOZO8,Very well explained instruction.  If you are someone who appreciates details you will like these DVDs.  I highly recommend getting this series.,1419206400,,143,5.454545454545454
6123771,2,B00GXKOZO8,"This guy talks entirely too much. It takes FOREVER to get through half of one technique. there are 3 discs to this product, and it took way too long to get through just disc one. The techniques seem to be good but they are extremely over explained and there is simply entirely too much talking going on. It would be much better as a simplified version on one or two discs",1409356800,2,371,4.23943661971831
6123772,5,B00GXKOZO8,"If you're new to BJJ, get this set. Don't think just pick it up.

Ryan is awesome at explaining and teaching you fundamentally sound BJJ. He's a master of focusing on technique and the right things to do, while helping you understand where your weaknesses may lie.

I've watched several other sets, and currently train 3-4 days/week, watching these DVD's have been really helpful in taking my game to the next level as we do focus on moves/technique but Ryan gives you a ton of explanation and insights into a lot of the basic fundamentals.",1400630400,5,540,4.673684210526316
6123773,5,B00GXKOZO8,I got this DVD set a few weeks ago. I also own the arm triangles and the triangle DVD sets. Ryan Hall is a great teacher and this is a great way to take your game to the next level. Considering how much money it would be to do a private lesson with this guy buying these sets is a bargin.,1391644800,5,288,3.737704918032787

8628450,5,B00GXKOZO8,So f'ing gooooood,1490313600,,17,5.0
8628451,5,B00GXKOZO8,"This is an absolutely fantastic, peerless series on passing the guard. Professor Hall spends nearly six hours going over all of the major, classic passes, combinations and transitions. In addition to the passes and combinations he covers grip fighting from a variety of positions and trouble shooting these positions.

One of the things I like most about all of his instructional series' are not only does he thoroughly cover the ins and outs of a position but he covers the theory of the positions and submissions so that you can apply these methods in novel ways based on your understanding of the position/submission.

This is a must buy. I own all of his instructionals and while they're all worth the money, I would say this particular work comes as close to an essential buy as an instructional can get.",1487030400,2,809,4.81294964028777
8628452,5,B00GXKOZO8,RYAN IS AWESOME,1477872000,,15,4.333333333333333
8628453,2,B00GXKOZO8,not great,1470873600,,9,4.0
8628454,5,B00GXKOZO8,Great guard passing instructional.  Not just a number or random techniques but a system of how to approach passing the guard.,1463184000,2,125,4.9523809523809526
8628455,2,B00GXKOZO8,Why would you make a DVD about Passing guard and not include any material on opening the closed guard? Seems rather foolish considering this was the primary reason I bough this DVD. So if your not looking for any information on how Ryan Hall opens the closed guard and just want info on passing then this is a fine DVD.Otherwise avoid.,1456444800,7,335,4.508196721311475
8628456,5,B00GXKOZO8,"Great instruction like all of Ryan's dvd sets. Very good explanations of the techniques and concepts. Yes, there's a lot of talking, but it's all valuable information. If you haven't seen any of the Ryan hall instructional series before, they tend to be more conceptual, rather than just showing a bunch of techniques. His explanations of ""why"" carry over to mutliple techniques and help you to think critically about jiu jitsu, rather than just memorizing details of a specific move. By far my favorite instructor to learn from on video.",1453593600,3,538,4.988888888888889
8628457,4,B00GXKOZO8,"good product, fast delivery",1451520000,,27,6.0
8628458,5,B00GXKOZO8,"Great details in the videos.  There are a lot of great tips that come out as he demonstrates.  This is a perfect compliment to your regular instructor, unless they spend a ton of time with you on each move.  That's the real value of these DVD's in my view.  Ryan Hall spends a lot of time touching on many details, and most instructors simply do not have the time to dedicate to that level on each move.  Not a replacement of or better than regular classes on the mat, just a perfect adjunct to the class time and open sparring.  Just take one tip from a section on the video and work it in the sparring, and you'll see progress.",1449878400,2,629,4.2
