1640607,3,B00005O5AU,"This review is for the 1999 version with Ice T and Mario Van Peebles. A religious fanatic, played by Peebles, thinks killing and kidnapping is okay. He kidnaps a scientist that could save the Earth from being hit by a meteor. He believes God has willed man to be eradicated so he doesn't want the scientist to prevent it. Fortunately for us Ice T is being released from prison just to take him out. Good B actioner for a slow Sunday. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

1640609,1,B00005O5AU,"Ice-T (Mean Guns, New Jack City) is released from being a convict by female cop Suzy Amis (Firestorm) because religious gospel talking Mario Van Peebles (Baadasssss!, The Hebrew Hammer) has in his capture a scientist, played by Linden Ashby (Mortal Kombat) who can stop a  astroied from wiping the planet out. All that's missing is Ice-T and Coolio in space, that would be cool. Seeing them in space, trying to stop the astroid...that would be cool. No, nothing of the sort in this thriller which just doesnt thrill, it gives off bad acting and kills Coolio (Batman & Robin) off in his cameo. Suzy Amis doesnt even look like's she trying, Ice-T is himself and Peebles doesnt even give off enough juice in his role though he  has some moments. Also starring Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr (The Fifth Element, Friday movies). Suffers from being just too boring.",1128384000,,851,4.782312925170068
1640610,4,B00005O5AU,"Ice-t has done a whole lot of crappy movies but he's a cool dude so whenever he's in a movie the movie gets watchable even if it's a crappy one...

This one is a b-action movie like ice-T has done a whole lot of but this is probably one of the better ones... last ones I saw was POINT DOOM and AIR RAGE and they are ten times worse than this...

About the movie alot of good actors like tiny Lister Jr, Mario van peebles and a not so good actor: don't know her name but its the female cop who has the lead...

I'm not saying this is the best movie ever but it's enjoyable...",1119657600,,574,3.9310344827586206
1640611,4,B00005O5AU,"Okay, so the back of the DVD box is really misleading, since they show several asteroids hitting NYC, which is erroneous because the asteroid is one big chunk and decimates the San Francisco area.  But since packaging isn't worth docking a movie, I'll focus on the film itself.  JUDGMENT DAY while not big budgeted like similar DEEP IMPACT or ARMAGEDDON is nonetheless entertaining on its level.  Rather than focusing on pyrotechnics involved in destroying the asteroid, we get to focus on FBI agent Suzy Amis (once married to the King of the World James Cameron) and convict Ice T (in one of his more tolerable characterizations) trying to find the one man who can stop the asteroid from obliterating manking (Linden Ashby).  But enter religious fanatic Thomas Payne (played rather controlled by Mario van Peebles), who believes the asteroid is God's judgment so he kidnaps the scientist to prevent him from destroying the asteroid.  It seems rather odd that there would be only one man capable of affecting such a global catastrophe, but it's Hollywood, man, so anything goes.  Director (former actor John Terlesky of Deathstalker II) keeps the pace tight and delivers what you probably would expect from this straight to video release.",1108684800,3,1238,5.044117647058823

1640613,1,B00005O5AU,For Ice T and Mario Van Pepples that is. Two of the worst actor to ever grace the screen star in a movie together and whatz worst hollywood is still givin this cats money to make more films what the f--- are they thinkin. If you want to rent a movie with a fine woman(Shireen Crutchfield) rent this movie if you want a good movie rent something else. Mos def!,967593600,3,359,4.142857142857143

1640619,4,B00005O5AU,"I liked this movie.  It had a lot more violence than I expected, which was good.  I don't like unnecessary action but I like it when it fits the story as it does in Judgement Day.  The plot wasn't original or complicated, but it was complete.  There was some character development, which I can give or take in an action/disaster film.  I liked that there was more action than special effects.  The effects themselves were good.  The twist wasn't too hard to figure out and I like that too.  Anymore there are too many movies with too many plot turns & twists that it looses something.  I gave this four stars because it was a good movie for it's genre and I liked the actors, who were good in their roles.",1409702400,,705,4.320610687022901

1640622,2,B00005O5AU,"okay. Just caught this on TV1 tonight. First off, there is some above average script writing for a low budget film, and the gun effects are nice as well. Some of the characters are interesting, but the plot is a bit hokey (gangstas and asteroids?), and Suzy Amis appears to be recovering from a  hang over. Totally uninspired performance, her lines are delivered as if she were rehearsing rather than actually ""acting"". Better casting and better direction needed. The Coolio death scene is about as uninspired as has ever been put on film. I kept yelling at the screen ""Hey, Mister Director, were's the passion!"". In fact, this film's biggest flaw is the flaw most grade B films have: A director who does not force his actors to display a sense of urgency. When Suzy is told the world is going to end, her reaction is similar to being told you forgot your change at the convenience store. ACTING!!!",1322870400,,898,4.647798742138365
1640623,4,B00005O5AU,I find this movie powerful and real. It sends a message of how the love of God can go through all our wrongs. They bring realism to everyday life and this is what is seen and experienced in our cities all day everyday. It's worth  to buy.,1310774400,,238,4.0638297872340425

7948460,1,B00005O5AU,"Other reviewers are spot on!  The story is ***so*** lame that I wanted the asteroid to hit!  The only character of any interest AT ALL is the bad guy (Mario Van Peebles).  I can't really blame the actors, though.  Between the plot line, the script,and the bogus dialogue even the best of actors would be challenged.  I am a huge fan of the genre... and love cheesy versions nearly as much as the Hollywood blockbusters... but this movie is just terrible. Go watch another Sharknado instead.... at least you'll giggle a couple of times.",1508025600,,535,4.648936170212766
7948461,1,B00005O5AU,"Horrible......absolutely horrible.  I am a fan of apoptotic movies , but this one was poorly written, poorly acted and has nothing to recommend itself....and I have  watched nearly every one in this genre. .There seems to be a hidden agenda here having nothing to do with apocalypse.

7948464,2,B00005O5AU,"Mario Van Peebles, an actor I can usually get behind, stars and produces this loser movie which seems to have two specific goals: 1.  Rip off Armageddon.  2.  Allow as many (C)rappers to act.

The actual premise of the movie is a meteor coming down to Earth to put things right -- urban renewal.  Suzy Amis stars as an FBI agent who is responsible for Refreshing Beverage (Tracy Marrow/Ice-T) getting out of prison to track down Thomas Payne (Van Peebles).  Hoping for help from fellow (C)rapper Artis Ivey Jr (Coolio) as Lucifer/Luther, the pair try to get a location on Payne.

Co-Executive Produced by Van Peebles, Marrow and another ""actor"" in this movie, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Brother Clarence.",1469577600,,700,4.831932773109243
