8685424,5,B00OYTCWSQ,"Listening to Rafe and Clelia is a treat, but being able to watch them takes it up another level. Clelia's smile is delightful reminder of the joy that comes from making music--old-time music, in particular--and being able to share in that experience as a listener leaves me happy, too. The Stefaninis play old tunes with new twists but are true to tradition and the Tiki Parlour has done a great job capturing a varied selection from their repertoire. Five stars!",1480896000,,463,4.8

8685427,5,B00OYTCWSQ,"This is an amazing DVD. Love the tunes, love the father-daughter dynamic - they complement each other so perfectly and are clearly enjoying the music together! The beautiful and quirky Tiki Parlour provides a great backdrop. Liner notes very informative.",1418601600,,254,5.375
8685428,5,B00OYTCWSQ,"Wonderful DVD of uplifting, soulful old time tunes being played by superb musicians.  The father and daughter duo are fun to watch as well as listen to.  The production and filming is excellent with close-ups of their playing that is especially interesting to any student of fiddle and/or banjo.  Even the packaging has a delightful old timey look and includes a booklet that is full of amusing anecdotes about the musicians, the songs they play, and even their instruments.  David Bragger of the Old-Time Tiki Parlour is doing a really good thing documenting these great contemporary musicians playing songs that go to the roots of American music.",1417910400,2,648,5.02803738317757

8685430,5,B00OYTCWSQ,This Old-Time Tiki Parlour DVD is a must for anyone who loves old-time fiddle and banjo.  Rafe and Clelia Stefanini are an outstanding father and daughter duo.  I especially liked the way the video gave a close-up look at hands that know how to make the most out of their instrument.,1417132800,,283,4.529411764705882
8685431,5,B00OYTCWSQ,"Wow!  A great DVD, so fun to watch people make heartfelt, soulful music and have so much fun doing it.  Amazing production value and sound, can't wait for more from these folks, their website says the next release is going to be Dan Gellert...yeah buddy!",1416268800,,254,4.622222222222222
8685432,5,B00OYTCWSQ,"I've always dreamed of seeing and hearing the masters of old-time music in such beautiful display. So many classic tunes, bios, liner notes and a perfect visual representation of two masters tearing it up.
As an old-time musician I love being able to hear such a perfect selection of traditional American tunes being played so majestically, yet with such power, by two generations of the old-time elite. Clelia recently won first place at the most prestigious old-time music festival on Earth and Rafe is one of the great modern powers of old-time fiddling and banjo. It makes sense why Bruce Molsky wrote such a touching foreword.",1416182400,,631,4.962264150943396
