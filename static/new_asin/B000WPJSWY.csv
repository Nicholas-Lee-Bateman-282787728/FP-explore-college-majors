2989075,5,B000WPJSWY,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""COME ON, TARZAN"" (11 September 1932) (61 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- . Ken Maynard was an American motion picture stuntman and actor --- Born Kenneth Olin Maynard in Vevay, Indiana, he was an accomplished horseman --- As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show and a circus rider with Ringling Brothers --- During World War I, he served in the United States Army.

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse. Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery in Cypress, California. Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book They Went Thataway --- His brother, Kermit Maynard, was also an actor and stuntman

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6751 Hollywood Blvd -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Under the production staff of:
Alan James - Director / Screenwriter
Sam Bischoff - Producer
Burt Kelly - Producer
William Saal - Producer

Our story line and plot, Opening scenes has Steve Frazier (Niles Welch) and his gang rustling horses --- What happens when the wild horse Tarzan frees Frazier's rustled horses --- Frazier gets the Sheriff (Jack Rockwell) to declare Tarzan an outlaw and have him shot --- This brings Ken Benson (Ken Maynard) into action and he now tries to protect his favorite friend Tarzan from harm --- By far the best Ken Maynard effort from low-budget producer Sam Bischoff, almost wall-to-wall action in this over the top oater --- In this tightly paced Ken Maynard western (one of nine he made in 1932), the cowboy star's amazing riding skills are on impressive display. As a child, Maynard copied all the stunts he saw in circuses, and at age 14, ran away from home to join a wagon show. Maynard finally entered the movies in 1923 after working as a trick rider with the Buffalo Bill and Ringling Brothers Wild West shows --- Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.
