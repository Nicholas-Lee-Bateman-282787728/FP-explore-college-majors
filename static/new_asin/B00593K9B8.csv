4620112,4,B00593K9B8,"This movie was a lot of fun. It's kind of like a cross between hangover and a Guy Ritchie film. The story line is the plot setter. Fiance picks up package for a friend, who is usually a ""MULE"",from the airport . Totally clueless of the contraband content she  proceeds to hand it off  to her boyfriend to deliver for her because she's busy with their wedding plans . The ensuing chaos is of course predictable but the performances by our individual actors are very good. The subplots are full of Karma coming back to bite you in the butt, while the action is sufficient to keep moving the plot forward. The guy who plays the head bad guy is quite good. This is not brain surgery, if you are looking for some deep meaningful drama this aint it, but it hits it on all cylinders for a comedy. Go on and rent it you won't regret it.",1330041600,,828,4.234177215189874
4620113,4,B00593K9B8,A very fun movie about three young urban flatmates who's lives and aspirations are disrupted by their accidental involvement with a smuggler. Nowhere near as vulgar as it's been made out to be and a lot more charming and funny than I expected. Includes a great Bollywood fantasy dance number parody. The majority of the dialog is English so even the subtitle-averse should enjoy it.,1325808000,,382,4.892307692307693
4620114,4,B00593K9B8,"Saw this on Netflix streaming. This movie is original, intelligent, funny and above Bollywood standards. I can honestly say that it truly entertains. But this movie could have been better. First off, a big round of applause for Abhinay Deo. My comments here should not detract from this splendid movie. Its quite above the usual garbage that Bollywood churns out. Some of the music like the ""Saigal Blues"" was an awesome touch.

But this movie could have been a bit better.
1)For example why portray India as this terrible, out-of-the-world place: If you're going to go to a very old quarter of India and shoot your entire movie there, then it gives a very unrealistic picture of Delhi. The same applies to any major city in India. There are old quarters that are 300 or more years old and there are the newer areas. So these 3 fellows live in this dilapidated place and yet follow this entirely American lifestyle? Makes no sense. And also that old 70's scooter? You can get scooters and motorcycles on installments really easy. 2)Representation of people carrying guns is a bit exaggerated. 3)The high contrast colors: I got somewhat of a headache with all the super contrasty colors. What's this for? To accentuate the dirt? A lot of Indian movies seems to do this for whatever reason. 4) Attention to detail: See the part where one goon is beating up a guy in a corner of a room - its pretty clear the guy is not getting punched. Also the switch of the contraband stuff was a bit convoluted. It could have been done better. I mean that part of the story could have been a tad tigher. 5) Sub-titles:several places where the English sub-titles missed out the good stuff.",1325116800,,1672,4.648648648648648
4620115,5,B00593K9B8,"Delhi Belly is an awesome story/film. Indians films are evolving in a spasmodic, unpredictable fashion; some people like Amir Khan are doing an amazing job in trying to get grunge/ slightly soiled, underbelly life out in the front. Especially when this culture meets the 'school going, studious, hard working ' middle class kid with hilarious results. The movie reminded me of my previous life in Mumbai, ( a run down apartment with annoying, noisy neighbors, a complete lack of water, punishing heat,no air conditioning and people with multiple personalities!). And my friends who could put classy Cuff Parade people to shame one minute and be throwing up with illicit moonshine the next.
Such clever films are read on multiple levels.
Most of us will watch, laugh and move on. But some of us can see deeper and understand why our friends, neighbors and uncles behaved (Mr jain) , the way they did back then. Or maybe...well, who knows.
 This is an artsy interpretation of the SH** that happens in life.
Buy the OST. It is worth every cent (or Rupee).
Life is short, maybe it was not supposed to be understood by everyone. Take what you can, ""Bakee log Khisko""

4620116,4,B00593K9B8,"This is a great movie. Its pure entertainment. The multitude of cultural references make it a very interesting watch. However, the movie is 18+, with strong language and some violence and is not your typical Bollywood song and dance number. If you like traditional Hindi movies, this may not be for you.",1320192000,,303,4.846153846153846
4620117,1,B00593K9B8,"Do you call this a movie? Do you really? Those who really liked it (they say ""love it or hate it""), should question themselves why is it so..I guess people who like movies like BORAT, will find this movie extremely entertaining, just because it's simply overpouring with the 'F word' and potty jokes/things. However, that's not my point. Dirty comedies have their special audience and when the movie is classified in that category, it is perfectly fine to show whatever you want (that's what public wants to see). However, there needs to be som substance of some kind. Most importantly, as these movies have their own audience, they equally have their own directors/production houses. You can't have BORAT directed by Spielberg (with due respect to both Sir Spielberg and Sacha Baron Cohen, as I like them both). My point is, Delhi Belly (DB) is under ""aamir khan production"", whose first movie was the masterpiece LAGAAN. Given the reputation of aamir khan's name in bollywood (and given the fact that bollywood is known all over the world), i think it's crucial to consider this before trying to take a (so-called) BOLD move.
DB has nothing original...an age-old, used and re-used plot- Some ""imp stuff"" belonging to some mafia gets delivered in wrong hands by 'innocent' people who have no clue what's in the package, and then the entire chase game to hunt down the same. However, in DB, this all happens with people, who live in slum (but speak nothing but English) and throw ""f-word, a-word"" in every sentence without fail. Packed with extra marital affairs, scenes from toilet, this film will truly satisfy anyone who has special cravings for such things. However, the most imp point is, there is hardly any originality of any kind. All the verbal jokes are stolen from here and there (Like the D K Bose song is originally from a hindi movie ""Kya Kool Hain Hum"", which was brilliant in verbal jokes). There is hardly any incidence where you actually laugh, so I won't even call it as a dirty 'comedy'.
The worst part is this movie is mostly in English, which clearly means this was intended to the people outside India and the 'high-class' Indian metropolitan crowd, but following the movies like ""Dhobi Ghat"" (also produced by Aamir Khan), this is the second crap that Aamir Khan has delivered. In the effort of following the R-rated movies of hollywood, this one goes out of control. The scriptwriter-director don't know where to stop and what is enough. Using the F-word for every single thing is NOT the only thing you need. What you need is a good story and characters to back it up. This movie lacks it totally. Thus, this movie clearly makes a very negative impact on the audience worldwide and also maligns the name ""Aamir Khan"". Next time I will be utterly careful to see any movie produced under 'Aamir Khan Productions"".
Anyway, if you like extremely dirty and mindless (not comedy though) movies, this one is for you. However, don't judge Indian movies based on this crap. This isn't Indian Cinema.",1318118400,,3016,4.801923076923077
4620118,5,B00593K9B8,"I don't know that much about Bollywood films. I have had a chance to see a few really good ones but since I hear they crank out a million films a year and most of them are mediocre, I figure I better wait till something rises above the fray before I spend my time. ""Delhi Belly"" is such a movie. In a way this is like the movie ""Diva."" Not only that the plot lines are similar, but that both show such an exuberance for the film making process that I wanted to stand up and cheer.

Here's the scoop. Three buddies, a reporter, a photo journalist and graphic artist share an apartment. Through a fluke started by the reporter's fiance, the three get caught up in a smuggling scheme and must wiggle their way out before their lives are forfeit. This is an oversimplification but why spoil?

This is a real hoot. You have great characters, explosive bowel movements, bad guys, oral sex (non-explicit), guns, cheezy cars, farcical mayhem and much, much more. They even have kissing which I thought they didn't do in Hindi flicks. This plays more to a western audience in its look, directing, humor and overall sensibilities. The lighting is great. The directing is way cool. The music is Okay. One of the lead females, though not really pretty, has a face you can't take your eyes off. She has more character in one eye than most actresses have in their entire frame. This is only the second outing for director Abhinay Deo, but you'd never know it. He's a natural.

This is what movie's are all about. If you're looking for an out and out riot of a film, this is it.",1317945600,7,1563,4.420138888888889
4620119,4,B00593K9B8,"As you may notice from the previous reviews, this movie seems to be evoking quite extreme reactions from Indian audiences - either love it or hate it.  It's generated some controversy in India because it's atypical for a Hindi movie: it's mostly in English and there's quite a lot of swearing; the humor is of the somewhat vulgar kind (feces play a key role in the plot); the characters have premarital sex; and there's not only a lot of verbal sexual references, but even a visual reference to oral sex.  All of this is unusual in an Indian film, but it would simply be the equivalent of an R-rated film in the US.

Produced by Aamir Khan, the film stars Imran Khan, Vir Das, and Kunal Roy Kapoor as three twenty-something, slacker-ish roommates who find themselves unwittingly caught up in a diamond-smuggling ring while also trying to navigate the chaos of their own lives - girlfriends, jobs, rent they can't pay.  I won't give away too much of the plot details, since the filmmakers themselves wanted viewers to come in with only a sketchy idea of how the movie is going to unfold.

The soundtrack is very good, but one thing to be prepared for: if you're a follower of Hindi cinema, you've probably seen the song promos/music videos for this movie.  Contrary to the usual routine, these song performances are not actually in the movie itself (with the exception of Aamir Khan's cameo, which appears at the end credits).  So if you loved seeing the three lead actors in the videos for ""Switty Tere Pyar Chaida"" or ""Nakkaddwale Disco"", unfortunately you won't see these in the movie.  However, there's still much to be excited about: the dialogue is fast-paced and very, very funny, as long as swearing and some vulgarity doesn't bother you.  The whole movie maintains a very fast pace, clocking in at only an hour and a half.  The three lead actors perform hilariously in their roles - this was the first time I had seen Vir Das and it led me to check out his stand-up comedy on youtube.  Imran Khan is believably scruffy and disheveled throughout, a nice change for a young actor who has played the more typical Hindi-romantic-hero type.  Kunal Roy Kapoor pulls off disgusting/endearing admirably.  I must also mention Vijay Raaz, whom I have loved since seeing him in Monsoon Wedding (as event planner P.K. Dubey).  There needs to be more of Vijay Raaz in Hindi films, so I was glad to see him with a role in this one (though I'd love to see him in a lead role someday soon).

Bottom line: very funny, gritty edge, great soundtrack, not for kids.",1311724800,4,2553,4.629711751662971
4620120,3,B00593K9B8,"Delhi Belly is a movie about three friends who are struggling in their careers and facing some vexing problems in their lives as well.
  Tashi (Imran Khan) is a struggling journalist who us having second thoughts about his impending marriage to his girlfriend (Shehnaaz Treasurywallah), Nitin (Aditya Roy Kapoor ) is the friend who suffers from Delhi Belly and Arun ( Vir Das) is a cartoonist who has been dumped by his girlfriend. These are the friends and who are three friends who are struggling in their careers and facing some vexing problems in their lives as well. They share a dingy apartment in Delhi and have trouble making the rent, their lives are turned upside down when one of the accidently consumes a piece of Tandoori chicken from a street stand and finds himself suffering from the worst case of Delhi Belly. His stool sample is supposed to be anlysed by his doctor but gets incorrectly switiched with a parcel of diamonds. These regular people get on the list of one of the most dreaded gangsters in the city (Vijay Raaz)
What works in the movie is the fact that although this movie is only 96 minutes long, each minute is full of surprises and there is never a dull moment. The director Abhinay Deo (the son of Ramesh and Seema Deo) is delivering on his promise to be one of the directors to watch out for. If you are offended by in your face vulgarity and cringe at excrement, oral sex, f-bombs, and violence, then this film is definitely not for you. Each of these cringe factors have been amplified and that is part of the reason that makes this movie entertaining.  In my opinion, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Vijay Raaz stole the show however each actor contributes. The music is ok, DK Bose or bhosedk as it means, has become the new anthem for the youth in India but it is not a great melody 3 stars. 7/8/2011",1310601600,3,1829,4.519637462235649
4620121,5,B00593K9B8,"DB : BOLD Bollywood movie by Aamir Khan .

DB is a  BOLD , fast paced Action , Comedy and a Daring movie.

Story Line : The journey of three roommates in the suburbs of Delhi when the delivery of a mystery package goes wrong, and they unknowingly become the potential prey of a ruthless gangster.
The whole movie has been shot in New Delhi .

All the characters in the movie has done a great job . The trio acted naturally...The dialogs in the movie are not double meaning dialogs like the older David dhavans movie . Dialogs are straight forward.

There are two reasons why DB might not work in all masses : 90% of the movie is in English , secondly the language used in Movie is A grade ( The movie has A certificate) .

 DB is worth a watch. Not to be watched with your Kid or Elders in house . Only for Mature Audience. Have a Fun laugh ride.

4620122,4,B00593K9B8,"Many in the US have never seen a ""Bollywood"" movie.  Yet India produces many more
movies than the US does, and millions of people watch them.

There are certain standards to be a successful Indian film.  For example, no kissing
further than on the cheek.  No nudity; no sex scenes.  No really foul language.  And,
you've gotta have a musical number or two.

This film transcended usual Bollywood, pushing a little past the usual conventions
(not too far, I might add) and has a great sense of humor.  It just might be a better
portrayal of modern India than a lot of what passes for non-fiction.  One can see
the aspirations of young, well-educated Indians to find an opportunity to find not
only a job but a career; to break into at least the middle class if not higher; and the
struggle between traditional values and the modern world.

Three young roommates are barely scraping by to pay the rent on their apartment
with all their jobs combined.  The lead character among the three is engaged to
be married to a woman from a much wealthier family [but you can tell from the
start, it isn't really going to work, she's not really his type].  Inadvertently (potty
humor and all) a shipment of drugs from supplier to high-level distributor ends
up in their hands, and then without even realizing what they have, it's out of
their hands once again. Then along come thugs, sent to collect the drugs and
most likely, kill them regardless.  What a pickle!

This being a comedy, you know they have to make it through somehow.  This
movie is fun and engaging.  I especially liked the big musical number in the
middle [representing one roommate's dreams of being a big star] which was
sheer fun to watch.  Give it a try!",1391385600,,1713,4.563934426229508

4620127,3,B00593K9B8,"Delhi Belly (Abhinay Deo and Akshat Verma, 2011)

Delhi Belly is a slang term for diarrhea, which plays a major role in the film. If this is something that's going to offend you, you might as well stop here. It's not like the film hasn't been excoriated by hundreds of Bollywood traditionalists for being filled with toilet humor already. On the other hand, if you like sharp, snappy crime comedies and can put the toilet humor in the back of your mind, it's not a bad little movie. And something coming out of Bollywood that runs less than two hours? Can you imagine? (For the anti-Bollywood crowd, the main reason the movie is so short is that it contains only one full musical number, and that over the end credits, with a snippet of a related musical number in a dream sequence halfway through that lasts about thirty seconds.)

The movie revolves around three slacker roommates, Tashi (Janne Tu...Ya Jaane Na's Imran Khan), Arup (The Curse of King Tut's Tomb's Vir Das), and Nitin (Panga Naa Lo's Kunaal Roy Kapur) who are forever trying to come up with ways to pay the rent and keep food in the house. Tashi, who normally works as a freelance journalist, is asked by his girlfriend Sonia (Shenaz Treasury, currently appearing in American soap One Life to Live) to pick up a package for her and deliver it, because she's got too much on her plate at the moment. Nitin, at the same time, is suffering the malady in the title and can't stray too far from the restroom--and since Tashi is already going out, can he drop off a stool sample at the local doctor's office? All seems to be going well until the doctor and the recipient of the other package, a slimy-looking guy nicknamed Cowboy (Monsoon Wedding's Vijay Raaz), open the bags they've been given. The doctor has a cache of smuggled diamonds... and Cowboy's got a pile of excrement. You can guess which of the two is happier. And which of the two is going to try and figure out where his diamonds are, and how far he's willing to go to get them back.

It's amusing, though it's trying to play in a very big sandbox and no one involved with the film seems to have done more research than sitting through Chinatown a couple of times and crossing it with some Beat Takeshi comedy skits. Which doesn't make it any less fun, though it's pretty derivative. But as long as you're in the mood for this sort of thing, it will deliver what you're after. And the Return of Disco Fighter sequence in the closing credits? Worth the price of admission by itself. ***",1366848000,,2512,4.504385964912281

It was full of American-style foul language, including plenty of the f-bomb to go around. It also had plenty of literal potty humor, too, but it was well-placed; the potty humor wasn't sophomoric, it was actually one of the plot points in this comedy of errors as one of our ""heroes"" has a suspected case of food poisoning.

The plot surrounds three twenty-something lads and a girl who all unwittingly get involved in a failed diamond smuggling scheme. The story is full of laughs and is tightly knit; it unfolded as it should without being contrived or forced.

I thought it was a very entertaining comedy, though of course I can see if offending some so be warned.  I think its intended audience for my children's generation rather than my own.
