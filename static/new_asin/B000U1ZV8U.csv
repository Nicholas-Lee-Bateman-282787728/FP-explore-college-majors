Granted they are silly and mindless at times but they are still
very enjoyable.",1343088000,,145,4.615384615384615
2913633,5,B000U1ZV8U,"I bought this set for ""The man who knew too little"", which is one of my favorite movies of all time. Its almost impossible to find now unless you go online. I got this set because it was like half the cost of just buying the one movie alone. It works great, I love that movie.",1323993600,,276,3.9464285714285716
2913634,4,B000U1ZV8U,You can't go wrong with comedy geniuses like Bill Murray and Steve Martin and the rest of the gang in all these terrific comedies.  Haven't laughed so much in years!,1322438400,,165,4.5
2913635,4,B000U1ZV8U,"This was the best deal I found for four movies I like.  The package of movies is a little random as far as actors and all, but it's a great deal.",1316822400,,145,3.6774193548387095
2913636,4,B000U1ZV8U,I bought this movie for the man who knew too little.  It seems like I can't find this movie anywhere.  This is some of bill murray's best work.  You will laugh all night long watching this and it will never leave your dvd player.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is not exactly the best quality dvd set.  It did however arrive on time and as described so I have no complaints with the seller.,1309132800,,394,4.064935064935065
2913637,5,B000U1ZV8U,"I bought this just for the man who knew too little.  I think Bill Murray is hilarious and this is one of my favorite movies that he has done, the only one I like more is What About Bob.  Vegas Vacation is pretty good and the other two are worth a watch.  Overall for me its an awesome value for the four movies.",1287014400,16,311,3.9047619047619047
2913638,4,B000U1ZV8U,"If this were on sale for $9.99, then I'd say it's a good value.  Sure, it's four so-so comedies, but when you're on a plane for several hours it's reasonable entertainment.",1238889600,4,172,4.548387096774194
2913639,2,B000U1ZV8U,"Spies Like Us was good but the other three were eh.  If they really wanted to make a good set, they should have included the original National Lampoon Vacation along with The Jerk instead of the other Steve Martin movie and then Groundhog day instead of that other Bill Murray movie.  But what do I know, this is why they sell these four packs in the first place.

Bottomline: you get what you pay for.",1222646400,2,402,4.333333333333333
2913640,3,B000U1ZV8U,"This is not any of the A List comedy films that Warner Bros. released recently or in the distant past. Instead, what you are getting are four C grade comedies that are just not that great. So far they are not listed in the product description, so here they are:

1. The Man with Two Brains (1983) - 3/5 - Stars Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner. This is one of those comedies that Steve Martin was making pre-Roxanne that somewhat missed the mark by trading funny for silly. Martin plays a brain surgeon who marries a beautiful woman and finds out too late her favorite hobby is tormenting men.

2. Spies Like Us (1985) - 3/5 - Stars Chevy Chase and Dan Akroyd. Chase and Akroyd star as two government employees caught cheating on a civil service exam that end up being recruited as decoy spies to draw out the Soviet defenses in Afghanistan. It's just not very well done considering the talent of the leads.

3. Vegas Vacation (1997) - 2/5 - I really liked the original Vacation and the Christmas Vacation movies, but by now the concept was really tired, and Chevy Chase just seems to be going through the motions.

4. The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) - 3/5 - Stars Bill Murray. Murray plays an American in London who mistakes real international intrigue with an audience participation game that he thinks he is playing. This is the only truly funny film of the four.",1188950400,17,1369,4.485943775100401

2913694,5,B000U1ZV8U,"I really only bought this to get ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"", as I've never heard of the other movies. I loved that there are no ads or previews.

2913732,3,B000U1ZV8U,"The movies themselves are great.  My only issue with this set is all 4 films are fullscreen instead of widescreen.  I should have looked a little more closely before buying, but I'm just writing this review to bring attention to this fact since modern televisions are really all designed for widescreen and the movies themselves were filmed that way.",1417824000,4,350,4.915254237288136

2913736,4,B000U1ZV8U,"I bought this set for ""Spies Like Us"".  The others are just bonus.  They are no frills DVD versions of these 80s films.  Nothing special and movie quality is just average.  Until some of these titles are converted to HD these will have to do.",1415491200,,242,4.311111111111111
2913737,5,B000U1ZV8U,"I purchased this as it was the least expensive way to get ""The Man Who Knew to Little"" starring Bill Murray.  This movie is so funny I can watch it again and again.  The humour is a little on the dry side - so not sticky sweet funny that would get annoying over time.  I crack a smile now remembering some of the funny scenes in it.  It's not always easy to get a good laugh out of me, but this movie does.  I actually had to watch it a few times to appreciate some of the subtle funny stuff in it.

I will also likely re-watch Chevy Chases"" Las Vegas Vacation"" at some point, as the actor who plays his son in it, his character of ""Mr. Pappageorgio"" a corny name he gets put on a fake ID so he can gamble and win in Vegas, is a hoot!  Definately the scene stealer of the entire movie!",1412035200,,785,3.930379746835443

2913783,4,B000U1ZV8U,"Bill Murray in ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"" is the only movie that I thought he was good in because the role was so dumb it played up to his abilities.  Spies like us reminds me of why I joined the Marines.",1371513600,,207,3.813953488372093
2913784,5,B000U1ZV8U,"This is one of the best comedies of all time. If you liked, ""What About Bob,"" then you will LOVE this one. Bill Murray is hilarious. I have no idea why this didn't go down in history as a comedy classic but it is in my top five of best comedies ever. Every time you watch it it gets better and better.

I really bought this for, ""The Man Who Knew Too Little,"" because otherwise the DVD with only that movie is way too expensive, but this is a great collection. I highly recommend it.",1370131200,7,483,4.08421052631579
2913785,5,B000U1ZV8U,We really enjoyed this package of classic films. It was fun to see how grainy the old movies were. I'd definitely recommend this if you grew up watching Chevy Chase.,1369612800,4,165,4.533333333333333
2913786,5,B000U1ZV8U,I grew up with Steve Martin. The man with two brains is so funny from start to finish.  His name alone is enough of a laugh,1369526400,,123,3.730769230769231

Over the years we lost track of this hidden gem (and our VHS player), but we were so happy to find it once again on DVD.  The other movies are great too, but if you haven't seen ""The Man Who Knew Too LIttle"" yet, you are in for a treat.  Definitely NOT for the kiddos, but genuinely hilarious for grown ups.",1467849600,,482,4.139784946236559

The disks are double sided, so there are no labels to help discern which movie is on which disk, but a little  searching will help find the right movie.
