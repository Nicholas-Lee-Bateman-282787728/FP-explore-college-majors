7994709,5,B0000A02WJ,"The Yardbirds are remembered, by some, as the musical group which produced Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page.  However, it was Keith Relf who founded the group and led its direction.  His writing, singing and harmonica playing fostered and encouraged the direction of the group.

The DVD ""The Yardbirds"" is NOT a mere black-and-white documentary of the group's history.  It has many color parts which feature actual, on-camera narration by the groups members, producers, etc., which make it VERY up-to-date and informative.  The music is absoultely wonderful too.

Don't miss the live performance of ""The Train Kept a'Rollin'"" which is about half way through the video.  When you see and hear this you will know that Keith Relf was the energetic leader of the group.  Notice how he ""works"" the audience also.  He WAS the Yardbirds !!!

This is a truly great and historical video of, perhaps, the greatest blues-rock band the world has ever seen.  If you love Clapton, Beck and Page you need to own this video to understand how it all started.

7994710,5,B0000A02WJ,"I bought this because I am in awe of Jeff Beck. This has plenty of recent Beck interviews, as well as J Page. That alone made this worthwhile for me.
In addition, there are fairly complete live performances of some of the Yardbirds' greatest hits. The documentary narrative cuts into some of them, but some are played in their entirety and most important pieces are represented. There are clips of what must be a 12 year old Eric Clapton!
A must have for all students of how rock was born!",1063756800,15,489,4.444444444444445
7994711,3,B0000A02WJ,"Thought/hoped this would be a collection of footage from various TV programs.  It was, but only in part.  It's a documentary, mostly interviews of all the former members (except the late Keith Relf).  Lots of good footage, I suppose, and not as big a RIP as ""Cream -- Farewell Concert"", but disapppointing still.  Could've had the complete performances, sound-stage, lip-synced, whatever, notwithstanding, with the interviews and all as an adjunct or separate channel (it is, afterall, supposed to be a DVD.)",1059696000,17,508,5.234567901234568
7994712,4,B0000A02WJ,"This is a nice career retrospective of one of the greatest British Invasion bands of the 1960's.  The video is stocked with great clips, however, none are shown in their entirety.  You won't see this footage  anywhere else.  I hope this gets a DVD reissue.  Any Yardbirds fans, buy on  sight, you will like this immensely.",954288000,6,322,4.660714285714286
7994713,5,B0000A02WJ,"clapton,beck,and page are all here. it only makes you want more footage as you can tell its been edited from lengthier performances. good narration and insights from various band members.well made. boy i sure enjoy my  copy!  are you envious or what!
