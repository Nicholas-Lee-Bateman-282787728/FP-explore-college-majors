8405338,2,B003TOZ6O4,"The film ""Hunting Game"" is being recycled as ""Big Game"" because the film sucks and they are attempting to squeeze a few extra dollars out of it with the C. Thomas Howell name.

Sully (C. Thomas Howell) gets out of prison and teams up with his two brothers to kidnap Toni (Haley Webb). Due to bungling they end up with a boat load of high school kids and hunting them...not for sport, but because they got away.  Oh yeah, the high school class is about survival of the fittest in an attempt to ""go deep.""

Not worth watching under either title.
