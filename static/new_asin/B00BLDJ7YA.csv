5643641,5,B00BLDJ7YA,I can't believe this movie has garnered such few stars. I felt it was one of the best movies I've ever watched. A beautiful soundtrack. A nuanced blend of fast action mixed with more reflective scenes. Great cinematography. It's a must-watch film for any movie lover.,1388793600,,267,4.826086956521739
5643642,3,B00BLDJ7YA,"A very good looking film, superb acting (from a self-limiting script) but obsure, hard to follow, long and drawn out, boring at times, with stereotypical and flat characters. It's hard to make a mediocre Chinese WW II film about gangsters and Japs in China, but director Jing Wong has succeeded...or failed, as it were.",1384992000,,319,4.925925925925926
5643643,5,B00BLDJ7YA,"This is probably one of the best Mainland-Hong Kong collaborations so far. Most have been absolutely dire, Johnnie To's DRUG WARS being a recent example mainly because of the current inabilitity to merge the best of bot traditions. To my suprise, entertainment impresario Wong Jing has managed to make a film representing the best of both traditions: locations, bid budget, good acting, and a performance by Chopw Yun-fat reminiscent of his other collaborations with the director. It is ironic that Wong Jing has shown the way and not Peter Chan, Tsui Hark and others whose talents have become overwhlelmed by access to the Mainland.",1384300800,,633,5.096153846153846
5643644,3,B00BLDJ7YA,"First things first. The Hong Kong film has nothing to do with an Elia Kazan film of the same title made in 1976. The Last Tycoon (Da Shang Hai) is a Hong Kong crime drama starring two big names Chow Yun-fat and Sammo Hung. Actually, Sammo Hungs role is more like an extended cameo, and director Wong Jings epic-scale drama, set in the early twentieth century Shanghai, follows the life of a triad boss Cheng Daqi (Chow Yun-fat) and his romance with his childhood friend Ye Zhiqiu (Yuan Quan / Feng Wenjuan), who becomes a famous Chinese opera performer. Huang Xiaoming plays the crime lord in his young days.

Ever charismatic Chow Yun-fat looks fine as always, but obviously this is not among his best work. His character lacks depth, and his romance with Ye Zhiqiu needs chemistry. In addition to the too many subplots involving political intrigues, hidden romances and Japanese invasion, the crime drama heavily suffers from its double narrative structure, where the story goes back and forth between two timelines too frequently.

Most Hong Kong film fans know the name of director and co-writer Wong Jing. The prolific filmmakers works in the past include God of Gamblers starring Chow Yun-fat, and City Hunter, starring Jackie Chan. The Last Tycoon is the directors most ambitious work, an attempt to do something different, with gorgeous costumes and production values.

With all due respect to him and the effort he must have done to create this film, The Last Tycoon is a huge disappointment, with a familiar story told with plodding pace. We need something more than the star power and occasional so-so action set-pieces.",1382745600,4,1631,4.923636363636364
5643645,3,B00BLDJ7YA,"Jing Wong's The Last Tycoon is a reasonable entertaining film. There are more than a few engaging sequences, though they are buried enough amongst many forgettable and vaguely familiar moments to make The Last Tycoon feel like the echo of better films from recent past. Despite a jarring editing style which jerks the audience back and forth in time, there are few surprises to be found and little distinctly memorable. With that being said, The Last Tycoon is still a reasonably entertaining film.

  Action star Chow Yun-Fat plays the seasoned older version of the film's main character, Cheng Daqi, and it almost feels as though the editing was a choice made in order to keep the film's largest star equally dispersed amongst the narrative. First played by Huang Xiaoming, Daqi is a young man working for a fruit stand owner in the early 1920s when he is framed for murder and forced to become the right hand to a triad boss, Hong Shouting (Sammo Hung).

He is forced to leave behind childhood sweetheart, Ye Zhiqui (Feng Wenjuan followed by Yuan Quan), only to meet up with her later in life as a powerful gangster. She is married to Mao Zai (Francis Ng) whose involvement in the battle against Japanese occupation doesn't always take her best interest at heart. Daqi takes it upon himself to protect his long lost love, despite her marriage to another man, forcing him to risk all that he has for something he has lost. The film's narrative actually shares a great deal with Casablanca, but this does not help the film's uneven editing.

5643646,3,B00BLDJ7YA,"""Even if your battalion can take Shanghai in one day, they will never ever find you again."" In the 1930's Shanghai was full of ruthless gangsters. Working his way to the top of the criminal underworld Cheng(Yon-Fat) he thinks he is untouchable. When he finds himself stuck in the middle of the invading Japanese army and the secret service he realizes he has more enemies then he thought and is left on his own. I was looking forward to this movie quite a bit. While I am not a huge foreign movie fan I am a big fan of the gangster genre. This movie was a little slow moving but still worth seeing. Being a foreign movie 80% of people will not watch so this won't be a long one but the best way to convince people to see it is to go generic. This movie is a mix of a war movie and The Godfather as directed by Quentin Tarantino. If that won't help you then I don't know what else to say. Overall, little slow but worth watching. I did like it. I say B-.",1379289600,,953,4.101604278074866
5643647,4,B00BLDJ7YA,"The Last Tycoon borrows inspirations from quite a lot of other films, but it pieces them together in a way that works. The end result being a great, thoroughly watchable and enjoyable drama.

In the style of The Godfather Part II (although here the corresponding stories are of the same man, rather than father and son), The Last Tycoon simultaneously tells the story of a young man's rise to power while at the same time telling of his struggles to remain on top.

Fans of Chow Yun Fat will be well pleased as he gives a grand performance as the older Cheng Daqi, a man navigating questionable loyalties trying to do the best for himself and his country during a tumultuous time of Japanese occupation of China. Huang Xiaoming puts in a solid performance as the young Cheng Daqi, a man making sacrifices of principle to get all he's hoped for out of life.

The rest of the cast is terrific, with Francis Ng in particular giving another stellar performance, and it's probably impossible to not love watching Sammo Hung in anything.

Another plus is that fans of Chow's older films will be happy with the action scenes in the film. It's well-directed, and although Chow's not doing any acrobatics like he did 15-20 years ago, the shoot-outs are still hard-hitting and satisfying for action fans. It's certainly not a wall-to-wall action film by any means, but it's paced excellently and at no point feels slow.

Both stories play out extremely well overall, with nice nuances tying them together perfectly, and the climax is fantastic. It's a slick, highly recommended drama that most fans of crime films or Chinese films or even fans of any of the many star actors in it will find something to enjoy in.",1379116800,,1703,4.701342281879195
5643648,5,B00BLDJ7YA,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, despite reading reviews which rated this movie at 6.4 on a scale from 1 to 10, I bought the blu-ray copy of this movie from Yesasia.com before it was released here in the United States, and I must say that the film is beautiful and entertaining from start to finish, Chow Yun Fat played his part well, along with the other main characters. If you enjoy Asian cinema, I will say this movie should be a must have for your collection. I rated this movie a 9 on a scale of 1 through 10.",1377993600,2,527,4.176470588235294
5643649,4,B00BLDJ7YA,"I have been looking forward to this movie since I first read the concept.  This is an attempt to capture some of the old-school Chow Yun Fat.  Directed by Wong Jing, there is high melodrama and several slow motion shootouts.  It was nice to see some of my favorite Hong Kong stars, in Sammo Hung and Francis Ng, sharing the screen with CYF.  Finally, I did like the young actor who portrayed CYF's character as a young man, Xiaoming Huang.  I'll be looking for more from him in the future.  I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone, but your enjoyment value will be higher if you appreciate the CYF of the 80's and have been wanting him to return to that kind of film.",1366329600,,679,4.307086614173229

8570343,4,B00BLDJ7YA,"I found this a very entertaining movie. The lead role as a young man is played by an excellent young actor and the older version of this man is played by Chow Yun-Fat. The script was very well written and the scenes and costuming enjoyable. While the story line is a little predictable, Chow pulls it off with his always superb acting and ""presence"". A lot of action as well as some romance.
