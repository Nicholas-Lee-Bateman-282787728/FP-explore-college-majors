8404964,5,B003T386FG,"This trilogy is essential in modern cinema. It is the absolute negation of Marshall McLuhan who has demonstrated one hundred times that the medium is the message and the message is the massage. Lars von Trier pretends that he wants to remain absolutely neutral in giving to the audience the rough and raw world he is contemplating. These three films are progressively bringing to the surface in sharp focus a German film maker who is absolutely haunted by the crimes he committed directly up to 1991 or indirectly via his parents, relatives, acquaintances and friends like Gunter Grass. He is obnubilated and what he says is that the Americans, and in fact all the allies, western and eastern, have saved that guilt, remorse, regret, nostalgia of a glorious ten or twelve years when killing was an asset and a glorious achievement

Some may say that Germany is back on such trails, tracks, railroads and railways after reunification, after the top jobs having shifted to East Germans, after the financial crisis of 2009, after the European debt crisis of 2012, after the Irish crisis and then the Portuguese, Spanish, Greek crises, and the Italian and French debt problem(s) looming behind, not to speak of the refugee crisis across the Mediterranean Sea. Is Germany to be ber alles again and impose its leadership to the whole Europe? With the lackluster and mediocre leaders some countries are putting on the table we could think it might be an easy task and Lars von Trier would be amazed to have been such a prophet of the return of the werewolves. As if we were on the last page of Stephen Kings Dark Tower series to find out it is the same as the very first page of the very first volume, some eight volumes and four or five thousand pages before.

LARS VON TRIER  ELEMENT OF CRIME  1984

The first thing to say concerns the atmosphere and the style of the film. It is bleak. It is dark. The only color is a few dots of red in a lot of black. We are always or nearly always underground, in tunnels, galleries, with running water, in sewers or equivalent places. It is always the night with just some red lights or fire cutting the darkness. Then when we are inside some buildings they are just like outside, in ruins, dirty, bleak, dark, bad hotels when it is not some kind of indescribable refuge for human rats. It is supposed to be Europe, some reduce it to Germany, after WW2 and it is just a vast wasteland abandoned to its own irreversible decay.

The characters are two lets say ex-cops. One, Osborne, has fallen out of grace though he is the head and thinker of the film, and the other one, Fischer, is an ex-cop who ran away from police work to find some peace in Cairo. One day he accepts to be hypnotized by a doctor to try to find some solution to a case that is haunting him. This explains the blurred and fuzzy images, the lack of details and the concentration on desolation and a few details here and there that are hardly visible and recognizable or identifiable.

The only interest of the film, apart from this dystopian if not suicidal vision of Europe, is that Osborne advocates a special method to deal with serial killers. You have to enter their minds and penetrate their motivations. Why do they do this, why do they do it like that, and thus understand every single detail of the pattern of serial killers because they follow patterns. This is profiling as it was at the time devised by the FBI in Quantico. But the film shows that the cop runs a risk: he will little by little get into the tracks if not the footsteps of the killer in order to stop him by knowing what his next crime will be. He thus becomes the serial killer, and not only in a way, in reality. He has to stop and he did stop just in time.

I am not sure that the fact the prostitute he uses all along has had a child by the killer Harry Grey adds anything to the plot except that Fischer is thus put some more in the position and even place of the killer to make us even doubt whether he is not the killer himself. Thats the five seconds of tragedy, or rather melodrama. Of course we do not really know what is the past, what is the hypnosis or what is a new trip to Europe. Chronology is not important at all.

A film that is difficult to really penetrate because of this somber darkness that wraps everything, every detail in some unbearable horror. We are like repulsed by it more than in anyway attracted to it. Horrified no, terrified no, grossed out for sure.

LARS VON TRIER  EPIDEMIC  1987

Everything gas to be minimal, and minimal is everything. Black and white of course. Minimal camera, film, format, special effects, if any. Everything has to be really happening the way you see it, or nearly that way. Because the end is not exactly that really real and realistic.

A virus destroys the scenario that was on a floppy disk of one of those first text processors from before GUIs and PCs. So Lars and Niels have five days to produce a scenario and they are no longer interested by the one they have just lost, The cop and the whore, which would have been a remake of Element of Crime. So they start a new scenario from scratch in five days or so. I guess the virus got into them like a gremlin into some computer and they decide to get into the description of some epidemic in modern times.

The details are not really interesting. What is important is the treatment of the subject. If you have to only show real images and situations, how can you show a modern plague on the model of Milano under attack from the Black Death in 1348, bricking up in their houses the families that were infected for them to die inside their houses and not contaminate the others. Pure egotistic selfish absurdity anyway. Those viruses were transported by rats that do not know what bricks are and they can always go through if necessary, and they were probably already out. And the virus is like Father Christmas: it can go up and down chimneys.

Then they can go in archive underground with walls totally infected with some saltpeter like ulmcers in the plaster popping up regularly. That looks like some plague too. And then they get some facts that are told about this old plague. And if you cannot really show the new modern plague, at least you can show the scenario writers writing their scenario. And you can get into their minds and listen to what they see in their minds eye, how they see the film, the characters, etc. So there are a few cameos about that fictitious plot that ends in the most absurd way, but youll have to discover it yourself.

To add some modern realistic flavor they have one man telling what his mother told him about the way a whole set of people were parked or packed in some hole full of water and made to die slowly by the Nazis. We can believe that, in fact we can believe any horror about the Nazis. So no problem and we have seen so many images of these horrible events that we can put such pictures on the words. The film is only showing the self-imposed torture of the man telling what his mother had told him just before dying.

And we can also send the two scenario writers on a quick trip to Germany and have some infernal vision of cables, highways, tunnels, and all those means of transportation that would be the best vectors for any epidemic in modern times. Our cars are modern rats in a way. And I will say nothing about buses, trains, planes, and what the Canadians call char--bancs.

And that is what Lars von Trier is doing all the time, shifting us from any period of time and any place to any other period of time and any other place. He even includes a pathology department in some hospital and a dissection to reveal some glandular tissue change, small little pea-looking globules that develop no one knows why and how. Fifteen cases yesterday, mind you. Once again we are in for a sance of grossing out. But the final one is a champion in the genre, in the style, in the ambition to make us sick.

Lars von Trier uses a trick he has already used in Element of Crime and that is hypnosis. If you cannot take the producer of the film who is on a quick visit to Denmark to the plague itself evoked in the 12 page scenario, or rather sketch, you can bring a woman (of course it has to be woman, don't ask me why, but it has to be a woman) who is hypnotized by a man (and it has to be a man here too, don't ask me why but it has to be a man) and she is thus projected into the epidemic film and she describes the epidemic, what she sees, to the point of catching the disease, though it happens to her after it had happened to the first scenario writer, probably Lars if it is not Niels, and she develops, like him on his arm, ulcers on her neck and she gets crazy and she punctures the ulcers with a fork and she kills herself. Hows that as for a demonstration of the power of the plague, of the film seen as a contagious and killing fatal lethal deadly epidemic?

Altogether I am still not convinced as for that film technique that illustrates a famous manifesto cosigned by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, Dogme 95 and the Vow of Chastity. But what I am becoming convinced of is that if you try to only give true real material facts on the screen, you are spreading around the matter necessary to psychoanalyze you, which I hate. So I won't try to see how sick Lars von Trier is. But one thing is sure. That film technique is revealing the tremendous guilt some have in their mind and conscience. All beautiful stories, love stories and adventures, action films and horror films based on nothing but science fiction and special effects, utopia and dystopia, all that produces an audience that is blas, that does not believe in anything any more and that does not even know reality is really horrible, provided you accept to look at it instead of all the fictional depictions of it that only suspend your disbelief fifteen minutes and then let you go on living in the dreamlike reality you imagine you are all the time blind and deaf to any horror, mute of course like a dumb thumb when you should shriek and yell, howl and protest.

Leonard Cohen got it right right: I am blind, don't pass me by. But the audience is blind and it is them, every single member of that audience who passes by the real horror and does not see it because they have been made blind to it by the cinema of the cinema industry in Hollywood, Bollywood and Saint Denis.

But does Lars von Trier make us able again to see the real reality of our real modern world? I am not sure because the body, the flesh, the blood and adrenalin matter we are transporting on our bones and feet, is not more able to see horror than this blind audience Lars von Trier is speaking of, because we do not see with our eyes only, with our body only, because we see first of all with our mind, and minimalist films like this one do not make us think one iota more than Star Trek or Star Wars. And some people would disagree with what I have just said. And I might not disagree with them.

LARS VON TRIER  EUROPA  1991

This film, finally and at last, makes sense, though in 1991 it is a strange way to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. But sense it makes because the splitting of Germany in two was the only way the West, the victors could deal with what was absolutely still alive and kicking, that is to say Nazism and the obligation for most Germans to go on being Nazis because they had been Nazis and now they felt guilty about being defeated Nazis in their minds as much as remorseful about not being victorious Nazis, and maybe never being able to be any day.

The film is so clear about that. There is no doubt, no question asked. Everyone agrees and we are shown what they were able to do. The only hope the Americans, the allies had, was to get some of the big wheels of the regime on their side because they were industrialists for example and they were needed and they could be bought, cleaned up with some false Jewish witnesses and then whitewashed innocent.

But the Nazis in 1945 were everywhere and they were holding everyone who were werewolves at night and human in the day time. A Jew could make you innocent but then you were the target of the underground Nazis because the Nazi party was not Hitler but was the upper class in Germany with the support of 90% of all Germans still in 1945. So you could buy one of them but you had to take him as far as the USA for his security. When you have said that, you have the film on your palm because there is nothing else to say. How did Germany survive? How did they deal with their past and their memory and their guilt? Thats not the question of the film. Thats the pedestal of the German statue and that pedestal is not mud or sand. It is concrete, pure stone, stainless steel.

The film though has another dimension that makes it absolutely effective this time not because it terrifies us, not because it could horrify us, certainly not because it might gross us out. It is effective because it frightens us to the point of making us wet and soil our pants like a little baby in the middle of the dark night. It frightens us because it is still what the Germans are. This guilt, this deeper layer of crime and enjoyment in that crime is still there even in the younger generations because it was kept alive by the Cold War, because it was kept alive by the division of Germany, because it was kept alive by both the western pro-American side and the eastern pro-Soviet side.

Worse even than that is the fact that the reunification was the best way to erase the past, to erase the guilt, to finally be German again, conquering, proud, above all and everyone else. The every symbol of that is not visible yet in 1991 because the East Germans had to climb a lot of steps to take over the political machinery of the Bundes Republik, but it only took something like twelve years or so. Lars von Trier in his frightening vision of what it was in 1945 is projecting it into what it was going to be in 2015. In seventy years the full fledged reunified bossy and domineering Germany was to come back and tell Europe this time what was good for them, the Europeans, maybe, the Germans for sure, and good for the world, the Germans of course, the Europeans maybe and the Americans, if they play it nice for German business.

Yet the film seems to suggest that some sacrifice will have to be made by the Nazi side of history, getting rid of some of their werewolves who could betray, getting rid of their too obvious and visible presence in the full light of day. They had to go underground and they had to dive and settle deep in the minds of people. And that is definitely a genial side of the film. The Nazis are mental and ideological and not an SS militia any more.

The film, from beginning to end, is led by a hypnotizer who tells the main character to go back to 1945 and then to jump to this place and this time, in chronological order. But this character is dead as we learn at the end. So who is that hypnotizer hypnotizing if not us and no one else but us. He is manipulating us into believing he is manipulating the character who is strutting on the screen in a makeshift German uniform whereas he is manipulating us and that is even more frightening than what I have said so far because we are the accomplices of this situation, the accessories of this criminal intention and project, of both the Americans who are trying to take control of the country, but also of the underground Nazis who are trying to save the independence of Germany from sheer humiliation and colonial enslavement.

Lars von Trier makes us feel guilty because we supported the splitting of Germany to keep that basically imperialistic country under control. And in 1991 when Germany reunified we started running away, escaping, fleeing in our minds because we understood that Germany was back and with a vengeance to take. Was he right? Was he wrong? Are we still mentally being chased and hunted by our fright and fear? Maybe yes, maybe no, I don't really know, or don't really want to know, but for sure we cannot ignore the question.

We can then wonder if this film is really representative of the Dogma 95 manifesto and The Vow of Chastity Lars von Trier and consorts signed and advocated for the cinema or at least their cinema, a sectarian minimalist approach of the fundamental means of communication, the central TV and cinema medium for which the message is the massage, the medium is the message that means the basically sacrilegious ritualistic enslavement of the mind to some cool feeling of comfort in front of images and messages that caress us comfortably where it feels nice and matters.

But the color frames now and then are absolutely unrealistic and they emphasize the moments when there is some emotion, some emotional dimension in the situation. That is not minimalist. This is direct intervention of the director on our vision. And the hypnotist is definitely a means to take the control of our minds, of our reflection, of our thinking. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. So far three films, Element of Crime, Epipdemic and Europa, in black and white and the third one with a subtle play on color frames in the vast ocean of black and white pictures.

Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden as if the hypnotist was not a way to play on temporal and geographical alienation, depravation, even traumatization. You can tell me that one-sided manifesto was written in 1995, four years after the third film, but it is then a denial of all they have done so far, and it is when Lars von Trier is finally coming to some convincing discourse that he edicts his pronouncement that tells us all that he has done so far has to be discarded and the audience who was starting to find some interest in all has it all wrong and there the director is a terrorist who tells the audience they can go get lost in some antipodean place somewhere on another planet.
