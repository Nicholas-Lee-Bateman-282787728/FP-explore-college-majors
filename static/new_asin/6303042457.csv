556922,5,6303042457,"I first saw this movie during its theatrical run and found it so haunting that I have had to watch it again and again.  It seems to me that, like many European movies, there is an overriding idea running behind the  incidents of the story.  In this case, the overriding idea is that love has  different forms and levels.

The plot, which is set primarily in the middle years of the 17th century in France (1640-1670), involves the interrelationship between the familiy of Monsieur de St. Colombe, a great, but reclusive virtuoso on the viola da gamba, his two daughters, and Marin Marais, St. Colombe's pupil who becomes a successful player and composer on the viola da gamba.

The great contrast is between St. Colombe's intensely passionate interior life (his ""vie passione"") and  Marais' superficial one.  St. Colombe's intense love for  music and grief  for his dead wife excludes everything else, even his own daughters.  Marais is unable to love anything or anyone deeply enough and uses both Madeleine de St. Colombe and music to suit his own selfish ends.  He is cold rather  than passionate.  Yet, at the end, his goals achieved, he finds the rewards  of being cool so empty that he must return to St. Colombe where he, at last,  begins to explore the depths of feeling which attracted him to music in the  first place.  He eventually breaks through to this depth enough to merit  the approval of his master's ghost.

Given the film's meditative themes of love, grief, loneliness and the damage of ambition and it's rather brooding quality it isn't for everyone.  The subtitles often are  superficial, especially when dealing with matters of 17th century French  politics and religion (translating every mention of the Jansenist circle at  Port-Royal as ""the reformists"" for example).  However, the film  looks and feels right to this Baroque art historian and amateur musician.  As an exploration of the intensity which humans are capable of expressing  it is a masterpiece.",945907200,75,1984,4.930303030303031

557075,3,6303042457,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Tous les matins du monde is the story of two musicians, Marin Marais (played by the noted actor, Grard Depardieu) and his mentor, Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, during the time of King Louis IV in the 17th century. The late director Alain Corneau adapted the novel of the same name, written by Pascal Quignard. Little is known historically of both Marais and Sainte-Colombe, and Quignard's novel is a speculative account of the two mens' relationship.

The film begins with an elderly Marais (now the master player of the viola da gamba, a predecessor of the modern cello) recounting his youth as well as the biography of his mentor, Sainte-Colombe, who became a recluse on his country estate after the death of his wife. Sainte-Colombe did raise his two daughters, Madeline and Toinette, and taught them both how to play the viol, and the trio soon caught the ear of the king by performing local concerts. One of the members of the king's inner circle, Monsieur de Caignet, informs Sainte-Colombe that the king wants him to lead the royal orchestra at the court, but Sainte-Colombe refuses. For refusing the king, Sainte-Colombe and his daughters are banned from performing for the foreseeable future.

Sainte-Colombe, who never got over the death of his wife, withdraws further into his own little world, spending hours in a diminutive hut (set off from his main house), where he further hones his craft on the viol. The central part of the drama begins when a 19 year old Marais (played by Depardieu's son, Guillame), shows up at Saint-Colombe's door, and begs him to take this unpolished son of a shoemaker on, as a pupil. As far as I could tell, Marais plays beautifully for Sainte-Colombe, but Sainte-Colombe, due to his unreasonable quest for perfection, is unimpressed. He perceives Marais as a sell-out, who will do well making music at the royal court, but will never be a bona fide, true ""musician.""

Both daughters, nonetheless, are quite impressed by the young Marais and urge their father to reconsider taking him on as a pupil. Sainte-Colombe finally agrees to have the young man come back but after a short time he sends him packing. Marais ends up having an affair with Madeline, who teaches all her father's smart moves on the viol. And to top it off, Marais (along with Madeline), hides underneath the hut, in an attempt to appropriate more of the master's style. When Sainte-Colombe finds Marais underneath the hut, that's the last straw, and sends him packing for good.

Marais is depicted as having been seduced by court life and coldly dumps Madeline. She becomes despondent and eventually hangs herself. Sainte-Colombe becomes even more despondent over his daughter's suicide, and it takes him months before he realizes that all that brooding has done him no good. This coincides with Marais' change of heart; he realizes the error of his ways--his seduction by King Louis IV's court--which also leads to an his own life-affirming epiphany, and the subsequent decision to call on Sainte-Colombe, leading to a reconciliation between the two 'great' men.

In the end, Saint-Colombe ultimately realizes that the way he treated Marais was beneath him and simply arrogant. For a long while, he was obsessed with his dead wife, who he often saw in visions. He was brought back to reality by the crushing real-life death of his daughter. Similarly, just like in the case of his mentor, the death of someone close, was the catalyst for change. Marais realized that the way in which he treated Madeline, who he dumped for the seductive glare of the royal court, was awful and that he now needed to make amends. Marais could now approach his former mentor with humility and would now find an equally accepting and receptive Sainte-Colombe, ready to recognize his talents, which he was loathe to do, at an earlier juncture in Marais' career.

The film's strongest suit is undoubtedly the rich visuals evoking the period as well as the music, performed by the modern day master of the viol, Jordi Savall. Corneau's screenplay is sometimes slow and wordy and manages to rely on narration a little too often. It's a simplistic tale of redemption, relying on the melodramatic deaths of two female characters, to effect a catharsis in both principals.

Both Depardieus offer up convincing performances but it pains me to think about what happened to the younger Depardieu in real life (injured in a motorcycle accident, he eventually had to have his leg amputated; and later died of pneumonia at around age thirty). There's also the tragedy of director Corneau who died at the young age of 67 from cancer, not to mention the elder Depardieu's more recent troubles with the law.

Had Corneau and Quignard had a few more real-life facts about Sainte-Colombe and Marais to go on, this could have been a slightly more nuanced tale. Instead, we're asked to assent to Sainte-Colombe's label as a 'genius', without any real evidence. The dour narcissist remains fixated on his dead wife for most of the film, and only comes out of his shell when faced with the second tragedy of his daughter's suicide. It's hard to believe that the real-life Marais would have placed his mentor on such a high pedestal. Historically, the quality of his musical output is deemed superior to the so-called master.

Ultimately we must be content with the speculative character portraits proffered here. Tous les matins du monde is an extremely elegant film which features some great baroque music. Nonetheless, the melodramatic, invented tale of a conflict between master teacher and student, is not as believable or moving as the music, the narrative ably showcases.",1411344000,,5688,4.946596858638744

557078,4,6303042457,"The movie starts with Grard Depardieu rehearsing an orchestra to play Maran Marais' ""The Bells of Ste. Genevieve"".  During a break, he says that he's not the best viola da gamba player, his teacher was.  The rest of the movie is a flash-back to when Marais (played by Depardieu's son Guillaume) first met his teacher, Monsieur de Sainte Colombe, and his two daughters.
Back when the local Alliance Franaise presented this movie and I was the presenter, I did some research.  De Sainte Colombe had a son as well, and all three children were excellent viola da gamba players.  The ending presented in the movie is now how things ended according to history.  Still, I really like the music and the story is good.  If you get this, be sure to watch the bonus disk for more on Jordi Savall and the viola da gamba.  Savall was responsible for the film's music.  An interview on the bonus disk mentioned that Guillaume Depardieu actually played the viola da gamba, so his fingerings probably matched the notes that Savall actually played.",1385683200,,1031,4.720670391061453

557135,5,6303042457,"There have been many films that have explored the mystery of the creative process, but what makes All the Mornings of the World unique for me is that I am convinced all great art forms are in essence musical, capturing the varying rhythms and pulsations of being in the world as human beings, as most every great artist in history would confirm.

Having arrived in my twilight years, it becomes more and more apparent to me that at the heart of the music in all great art forms is a purity of love that opens a door onto the beauty and glory of the world (hence the title of the film, for it is the rays of the sun that begin the orchestration of life). And so, to arrive at the purity of any art form would necessitate arriving at the purity of love, and what I have also come to understand late in life is that in every great act of love there is always a great sacrifice and a great sorrow, for the wily ways of egocentric grabbing for power, self-affirmation and self-glorification is the most obvious way we humans choose to live in the world, hardly capable of great sacrifice and thus hardly capable of great love, the origin of the alienation we are all trapped in in some degree.

Perhaps All the Mornings of the World simply answers one question: Are we willing to sacrifice everything and move into great sorrow, the price one must pay to live in and become a great act of love?",1358812800,2,1389,4.338461538461538

557140,5,6303042457,"We tend to forget that before the Romantic period, ushered in by Goethe and consolidated by the likes of Wordsworth and Pushkin, artists were considered more as artisans than as divinely inspired conduits of emotional import. So, strictly speaking, Tous les Matins du Monde jumps the gun a bit by applying a post-Romantic perspective to a pre-Romantic era. But that's a small nit and not anything that should prevent anyone from seeing this deft movie. It's almost as visual as something from Peter Greenaway - and being more subtle it's also more interesting. The greatest moments of emotional impact are visual (though the wonderful music comes very close), as when de Sainte Colombe weeps upon seeing the ghost of his wife and when the mature Marais finally gets to play a duet with the master.

Sometimes the dramatic effect is as simple as counterpoint - as when Marais' absurd wig and flounces contrasts with the rudimentary night-dress of de Sainte Colombe's daughter who years before loved the young Marais but was scorned by him.

This is a movie where most of the action occurs in the faces of the actors. It is langorously paced but never tedious - just like the music that pervades everything. It's a largo, a rich deep-toned lament. And worth seeing many times over.",1300060800,,1279,4.862385321100917

After the film was made another 180 solo compositions by Sainte-Colombe were discovered to add to the 67 suites for two bass violas that were already known and which made up most of the music for the movie.

Not only is the music unbelievably BEAUTIFUL but the movie itself is wonderfully inspiring.  Based on the life of Sainte-Colombe, this is a MUST for every cellist, string musician and classical music lover.  WHY don't they have more movies (and music) like this??  ADD PLUS for those fans of French actor Gerard Depardieu -- as usually he gives (and should have received) an Oscar-warranted Best Supporting Actor performance.",1237852800,3,687,7.142857142857143
557191,5,6303042457,"I didn't realize as I watched the film the first time that it was inspired by actual lives -- Sainte-Colombe and Marin Marais are important figures in the history of music -- nor was it clear to me, until I did some research, how the film connected with important theological controversies of the 17th century. Hearing that Sainte-Colombe was ""a reformer,"" I took that to mean that he was a Calvinist and thus was confused to see him, in a later scene, in what was clearly a Catholic church. (The film makes me want to know more about Jansenism, about which until now all I knew was that it was linked with an extreme and gloomy asceticism. Until now I hadn't thought of it as a stream of Catholicism profoundly influenced of Calvinism.)

It was striking to see how Sainte-Colombe's form of Christianity, as depicted in the film, lacked a paschal dimension. He was a prisoner of his grief and found a degree of comfort only in the occasional apparitions of his wife, while being unable to express love to his two daughters or indeed to express love to anyone. As a result one tragedy gives birth to another -- his daughter's Madeline's entombment in self-loathing and grief leading finally to her suicide, and the bottomless sorrow of Marin Marais, who only too late realizes that his ambitions so overwhelmed him that he abandoned the one person who loved him unreservedly.

I suppose not much of the story is true to the actual lives of those we meet in the film, about which so little is known, but it has its own authenticity, similar to Pushkin's parable about Mozart and Salieri, and the film ""Amadeus.""

Both the music and photography are remarkable. Like so many others who have seen the film, I've now ordered a CD of the film's music, though we already have a number of recordings of Jordi Savall and the other musicians he works with.",1226361600,2,1845,4.6189024390243905
557192,5,6303042457,"The central theme of this movie is what is music for?  To master Sainte Colombo, it is for expression and exploration of the soul, where words cannot go there, music as a meditation and communing with the sorrows and passion.  To the young Marin Marias it is a means to fame, fortune, success, a job in the king's court.

The two viewpoints are interconnected when the young Marin Marias enters the lives of Sainte Colombe and his two daughters.  The family had been in perpetual mourning for the death of Mrs. Sainte Colombe, with the father retiring into a garden hut to commune with his music and ghostly visitations from his dead wife.  The daughters were left to fend for themselves, and the appearance of a young man sparks their interest.  After initially refusing to take him in as a student, he relents to his daughters.  One thing leads to another, and after using both the hospitality of Sainte Colombe, and leaving his elderly daughter broken and ruined, Marin Marais gets what he wants which is a position as musician in the king's court.

But all of the fame, fortune and glamour cannot satisfy him, so he returns to search out his old teacher, to find the great secret meaning of music.  The master asks him what music means, and Marin guesses again and again without finding the answer.  Finally he gives up and has a final lesson (first lesson from Master Sainte Colombe's point of view).  And he has learned that music goes beyond words, and into a realm beyond touching death and man's temporary existence.

The second disc contains a wonderful documentary of Jordi Savall, the viol soloist who plays for the soundtrack of the film.  It is 45 minutes, including interviews, performances, and explanations of how the viol da gamba captures the heartstrings of musically sensitive people.

557195,4,6303042457,"Another reviewer wrote that ""none of the actors is a musician, or even a viol player"". Let us hope, first of all, that this was supposed to read ""let alone a viol player"".

This reviewer went on to say ""thus, the two Depardieux and especially Marielle underwent several months of serious training on the instrument. The results are that the fingerings on the frets of the viols follows precisely the music being played"".

This is frankly rubbish. Guillaume Depardieu (who I believe plays the cello in real life) makes a damn good job of miming. Gerard is not bad. Marielle, however, is appalling to the extent of destroying the carefully built-up atmosphere on several occasions.

Terminology:

Other reviewers (and the subtitles of the Jordi Savall documentary) have made the mistake of referring to the instrument as the ""viola"" (even the ""baroque viola"" in one review). The correct term in English is ""viola da gamba"" or ""gamba"" for short (not ""viola"" - this is the alto/tenor member of the violin family, the tenor/bass being the cello). It can also be referred to as the ""bass viol"" - or just ""viol"" for (there were also such things as, for example, treble and tenor viols, but the bass was the main instrument of the family).

Trust me, I'm a musician (and play four sizes of viol as well as baroque violin and viola, among other things).

Having said this, the film is beautiful and well worth repeated watching.
The music is stupendous.

The Savall documentary is also pretty good - apart from the subtitles.",1184630400,6,1516,4.78544061302682
557196,3,6303042457,"In a town where I once lived there was a French bakery that produced the most glorious confections man has ever seen. Each was a work of art, so lovely and sculpted that lowly mortals would have felt ashamed to break or bite them. The window was more inviting than the magazine covers in Interstate gas stations--one gorgeous spectacle next to another, murmuring ""Come on big boy!"" When we finally plunged in, we experienced one of the biggest disappointments in our lives. The pastries were dull. My wife and I had four of them between us, planning an orgy of delight, but all four were mediocre. Not bad...no, no, not bad. But not very good either. Some were sweet but without flavor, some were neither sweet nor tasty. But none of the four offered much pleasure.

This movie is much the same. I don't care whether Jean-Pierre Marielle effectively fakes playing his instrument. What I do care about is that this film offers glorious music, a spectacular look, wonderful acting, great sets, brilliant filming and editing, and no content. What's the big theme here? Did Marais compromise some special artistic soul by becoming the king's lackey while Sainte Colombe remained true to some higher self? Nope, not at all. Marais is an arrogant jerk, whether he works for the king or the local pig farmer. He uses people for his ends. Sainte Colombe is a selfish self-absorbed man who sacrifices his daughters for his music. I know the world venerates those who create art, excusing Picasso and Thomas Wolfe their boorishness since they left masterpieces behind. I don't buy in here, as a man's relationship to the people he created trumps any relationship to things he created. But Sainte Colombe made no effort to leave anything behind. He spent his time alone, wallowing in self-pity and anger, allowing his children to fend for themselves. Art for art's sake? Come on...if he had locked himself up to watch porn or play video games, most folks would be on the phone with DFS in a heartbeat. But because he's an artist some special rules apply?

557237,3,6303042457,"While other reviewers have offered glowing reports of this film, they have clearly overlooked a fatal flaw: Jean-Pierre Marielle (as Sainte Colombe) is hopeless at miming the actual playing of his instrument. I am a professional musician and I found his inept fiddlings at the fingerboard to be so distracting that it diminished any profound effect the movie may have had.

His movements do not even approximate the actual music being played. One has only to watch the excellent documentary on Disc 2 about Jordi Savall to see what a real master of this instrument actually looks like. I had to constantly suspend disbelief in order to immerse myself back into the story.

Remarkably, Marielle tells us (on Disc 2) that he spent 4 months learning how to pretend to play the viola da gamba! I'm shocked that neither the director or musical supervisor allowed this travesty onto film. Where the audience hears a fast trill, Marielle is moving slowly or not at all. Where the soundtrack has a long sustained note, Marielle moves his fingers in a fast trill !  The only possible excuse is that the film's editor is at fault for not synchronising the correct shots.

The younger Depardieu fares far better - one believes that he is actually playing the instrument. Depardieu senior and the 2 women also appear to have taken the trouble to at least move their fingers in sync with the passages played.

This undermines the entire intention of the film - to portray a master of an instrument and of music.

His pupil,Marin Marais,however,is incredibly gifted, but wants the glamour and prestige of Court Composer. ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD is an excellent retelling of two tremendously talented men, each with a different approach and different aim for their music. Colombe sacrifices virtually everything,alienating his daughters and never pursuing marriage after the death of his most-beloved wife;and Marais,who wants to have it all and still be true to his music. Stuck in the middle of these two polar opposites are Colombe's two daughters,each having their own inner and outward struggles with talent vs life,art vs love,musical perfection vs disloyalty to their Father.

557240,5,6303042457,"The 90's undoubtedly represented a sort of Golden period in the French cinema. And Alain Coirneau's ""Tous les matins du monde"" is certainly no exception, for this movie rises well beyond the standards and blissfully embraces the elusive terrains of glorious and mystical rapture. Seven Cesar Awards confirming it. France. XVII century. The Golden Sicle of French music. Monsieur de Saint Colombe is a viola virtuoso, renowned in for his unique style, and also for his reluctancy to sacrifice the uniqueness of his art by becoming a King's entertainer. Falling into a deep depression after the passing of his beloved wife, who leaves him with two young daughters, Saint Colombe progressively secludes himself in his country house, barely seen even by his own daughters, almost solely allowing the company of his cherished viol. He then composes many of his most celebrated pieces. A desperate way of soothing his ailing spirit after the loss of his love: by creating magic on strings. A certain day, a young and promising musician by the name of Marin Marais will present himself to the Saint Colombe estate begging to the Master to take him as an apprentice. After an endless series of rejections, a reluctant Saint Colombe finally agrees and Marais will enter the Masters' cryptic and marvelous world of almost unbearable torment turned into glorious music. Day by day, Marais will learn techniques and achieve perfection in the art of the viol. In the process he will fall in love with Madeline, the eldest of Saint Colombe's children, as he slowly absorbs (take?) from the Master everything he can. Years will pass and Marais will not elude the enchanting call of the Courts, abandoning Saint Colombe, leaving a broken-hearted Madeline behind -she will eventually become fatally ill- and becoming himself a prominent musical figure in the King's chamber, a position carved for almost every musician in XVII century France. Marais ultimately became what we know of him today, a skillfull musician and fertile composer widely acclaimed in all Europe for his unduoubted virtuosity. But he also became a personal King's entertainer, a musician whose art had to be supervised and approved by the power in exercise, the very one thing the Master warned him of becoming, with all the gold and oropel attached. After many years of glory, a tired and somewhat empty Marais will still return to the Master's estate, long after his passing as well as Madeline's death, and with sad eyes will look time and time again, to the life and love he left behind. A life full of the simplicity and happiness purely given by the pleasure of making glorious music for the sole joy of the spirit.

As I write this I can almost hear in my mind all the sublime pieces that can be enjoyed in memorable scenes of the movie, such as ""Le Pleurs"" by Saint Colombe, or ""Improvisation sur las Folies d'Espagne"" by Marais himself. I would dare to say that music in this picture, performed by a superb ensamble under the musical direction of baroque music scholar, performer and composer Jordi Savall (Concert des Nations) is, simply put, ""the"" main character in this movie.  The movie soundtrack includes spectacular XVII century pieces, some of them unknown, but also authored pieces by J.B. Lully (""Marche pour la ceremonie des Turcs"", Couperin (""Troisime Lecon de Tenebres""), Saint Colombe (""Gavotte du tendre"", ""Concert a deux violes"") and Marais (""Improvisations sur las Folies d'Espagne"", ""La Reveuse"", ""L'Arabesque"", ""Le Badinage"", ""Toumbeau pour Mr de Saint Colombe"", ""Muzettes"" and the stunning and one of my favorites ""Sonnerie de Ste Genevieve du Mont-de-Paris"").

As for the cast, Jean Pierre Marielle plays the tormented Monsieur de Saint Colombe. Young Marin Marais is played by Guillaume Depardieu, a surprisingly gifted and young actor, with a last name far from unknown. His father, the genious Grard Depardieu impersonates old Marin Marais, while Anne Brochet (Cyrano de Bergerac's ""Roxanne"") beautifully plays Madeline de Saint Colombe. This particular 2-DVD edition not only renders an extraordinary sound and picture quality but is also filled with documentaries and featurettes about the making of the movie, and also specifically about Jordi Savall's contribution to the knowledge and appreciation of the endless richness of the baroque music, and particularly for the viola da gamba and its unparalelled sound.

""Tous les matins du monde"" (and its soundtrack as well) will deeply move anyone who has the ability to listen, far beyond words.",1162512000,43,4534,5.1147098515519565
557241,5,6303042457,"'Tous les matins du monde' is more an experience than a movie.  The brainchild of director Alain Corneau, writer Pascal Quignard, and musician Jordi Savall this film integrates the visual with the historicodramatic and the music that created the idea and bathes it in  the most sensuously beautiful cinematography of a period (the 17th century) by Yves Angelo who is given the sets and design and costumes by Bernard V&eacute;zat and Corinne Jorry that create image after image of masterful still life.  The total integration of the work of these masters is the plinth on which the actors offer the memory of two famous composers in French classical music history.

Saint-Colombe (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is a viol player and composer whose wife (Caroline Sihol)  dies young leaving him to raise his two daughters young Madeleine (Violaine Lacroix) and young Toinette (Nad&egrave;ge Teron) whom he teaches his art of viol de gamba performance while sequestering himself and his girls in the countryside.  Into their garden comes the young handsome son of a shoemaker, Marin Marais (Guillaume Depardieu, the son of Gerard Depardieu) who commits to learning the viol and eventually becomes a court musician only to fall in love with Saint-Colombe's elder daughter Madeleine (Anne Brochet) whom he eventually leaves for the glories of the court.  As an adult (G&eacute;rard Depardieu pere) he realizes his error and returns to the Saint-Colombe sanctuary where he learns the true meaning of music as being something beyond words and thus something beyond human.

In the course of this quiet little film and in the dramatic lighting of the production design we hear the music of Couperin, Lully, as well as compositions by Marais and Saint-Colombe.  Jordi Savall supplies the incidental music that binds these works and offers the viol playing together with a talented group of musicians.  The story is small, the dialogue sparse (primarily Depardieu pere narrating his experience as Marais) and for the novice the film could be slow.  But the incandescent beauty both visually and aurally make this film a work of art that has not been equaled since its appearance on the scene in 1991.  It is a treasure.  Highly recommended.

557244,5,6303042457,"Alain Corneau's 1991 All the Mornings of the World (Fr. Tous les matins du monde) is undoubtedly the most beautiful and meaningful film ever made about music and what it means to be a musician.  Working in close collaboration on the scenario with the author of a novel by the same name, Pascal Quignard, Alain Corneau chose among the Baroque repertoire the essential pieces of music for the film, exhuming in the process rare pieces by Monsieur de Sainte Colombe, which he esthetically and philosophically opposed to Marin Marais' own music.  These pieces are masterfully interpreted by the world-renowned bass viol player, Jordi Savall, who provided what I would call ""the icing on the cake.""  The film won no less than seven C&eacute;sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars.

The film relates the real story of Monsieur de Sainte Colombe, with a few fictitious anecdotes added to make it more interesting.  As in the novel, the dialogue is simple, using our contemporary vocabulary, but the turn of the phrases are typical of 17th Century parlance, whose style recalls the writings of the French dramatists of that epoch, like Pierre Corneille or Jean Racine.  The whole story is told from Marin Marais' point of view.  The voice-over by Gerard Depardieu imparts a rhythm to different scenes of the film, and when he recalls the life of the Sainte Colombe family before his arrival in the picture, the words precede the images, which then follow as illustrations.

The music, intimately linked to the story, also provides a rhythm. Almost every scene has to do with music, unless it provides an explanation. During Madeleine's ultimate meeting with Marais, it simply substitutes itself for the words. But at no time in the film are we subjected to any dry, academic discussion of music theory.  We are treated instead to some great musical works: the rather little known music of Sainte Colombe, that of Marin Marais, exquisitely played by Jordi Savall, but also the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully (his rousing ""March for the Turks' Ceremony""), of Francois Couperin, and of Jordi Savall himself.

The two characters, Monsieur de Sainte Colombe and Marin Marais, differ wildly from one another in their physical appearances, personalities, and manners.  de Sainte Colombe first appears dressed in black, to play his viol at the bed side of a newly deceased friend.  de Sainte Colombe is a Jansenist, stern, taciturn, and somewhat old fashioned, and he chooses a life of a recluse upon his wife's death.  As a Jansenist, he abhors the Jesuits, especially those who live in ostentatious luxury at Versailles.  He has problems communicating with other people, including his daughters, his only effective means of expression being his music.  He stays silent most of the time, and when he speaks, he is curt, as if incapable of conversation.  At the time of the story, he is at an age when a man's character, his personality, does not change.  He is also sentimental, staying faithful to the memory of his deceased wife, who appears to him when he plays well.

When Marais first appears, he is dressed in a red jacket.  Marin Marais is young, and although a little timid at first, he soon becomes sure of himself.  He is ""on the go,"" ambitious, and sees a career in music as a way to change his social class.  He is definitely a ""social climber.""  Marais is ruthless in his pursuit of his aims: having drawn the maximum out of Madeleine, her knowledge of the viol and her love, both of which she gave freely, Marais drops her like an old shoe and escapes to the Court.  The audition scene unambiguously determines the characters of the two protagonists: the young virtuoso plays facing the audience, in full light, while the Master is shown in profile, partly in the shadow.

This scene also reveals two opposite reasons for playing the viol.  Marais, having lost his singing voice after entering puberty, is looking to the instrument for a substitute, just as Sainte Colombe, who lost his wife, is looking to his art as a means to reconnect with her.  But the young man, who has been evicted from the Court, also looks at the viol as a form of revenge, which will allow him to satisfy his ambitions.  Far from wanting a revenge on his fate, Sainte Colombe is looking for solace, for the appeasement of the internal wound he carries.

The actual playing of the viol by the two protagonists could not be more different:  Marin Marais' playing is dexterous, and a display of its virtuosity, in search for an audience's approval, while Sainte Colombe's is inspired, passionate and full of sorrows.  Their environments are also at opposite ends.  Sainte Colombe's house is calm, rustic: it's the country, but Marais' residence is in Versailles, at the Court of Louis XIV, with all its brilliance, luxuries and happenings.

Gerard Depardieu's son, Guillaume, just starting in his acting career, interprets Marin Marais as a young man.  He succeeds well at projecting the character of a somewhat shallow but determined young man.  Gerard Depardieu appears in the first six minutes of the film, and later toward the end of the film as the mature Marin Marais.  His acting is conveying the depressed state of mind of Marais in a convincing manner.  But, through his voice-over, he has an imposing presence all along the film's duration, which gives a sense of nostalgia and regret to the story.  But it is Jean-Pierre Marielle's performance which steals the show. He is just outstanding as the austere, taciturn Jansenist.  Marielle has acted in more than one hundred films, and his Monsieur de Sainte Colombe is certainly one of his best performances.  Anne Brochet's acting is delicate, as a simple and sincere young woman, and Carole Richert, as her ""sister,"" is a convincing as an easygoing Toinette.  Violaine Lacroix and Nad&egrave;ge Teron, in their roles as the two daughters in their earlier years, were an inspired choice.  Their personalities and acting well defines the differences in the characters of the two sisters, which are later developed by Brochet and Richert.

The film also pays tribute to 17th Century painting.  Lubin Baugin, a Jansenist friend of Sainte Colombe, famous for his still lifes, paints the pictures ""Still Life with Wafers,"" and ""Still Life on the Chessboard.""  Also, one cannot watch this film without comparing Yves Angelo's gorgeous cinematography to the paintings of Georges de la Tour.  Clearly influenced by Caravaggio, de la Tour's themes were few, as he tried to refine his chiaroscuro technique.  He was a specialist of night paintings, depicting interior scenes lit only by the glare of candles.  Angelo's images are stunning in rendering this effect in the interior scenes.  The light is somber and dark in Sainte Colombe's premises, translating the state of mind of the artist and his humble life, while it is bright and warm at the Court, reflecting the ostentatious life surrounding the King.

Corneau's many close-up shots and extreme close-up shots bring intimacy between the characters and the viewer, producing an intimate contact with the actors' deepest feelings, which could not possibly be rendered by dialogue.  This requires the outstanding acting of the two actor-musicians, especially during their music-playing scenes. Which brings up another type of ""acting,"" that of faking the playing of the instruments, as none of the actors is a musician, or even a viol player.  Thus, the two Depardieux and especially Marielle underwent several months of serious training on the instrument.  The results are that the fingerings on the frets of the viols follows precisely the music being played, and the facial expressions of the actors also mirror what one would expect from real performers.  This is not a trivial achievement, which contributes greatly to make the transformation of the actors into musicians convincing.

The film is an ode to the inner beauty and the meaning of music, and its main theme is the love of music.  All the characters in the film are connected to it; the teacher and composer Sainte Colombe who improved the viol; Marais also teacher and composer; the two daughters who give recitals with their father, and the Kings' representatives. At first, there is a divergence of views between the two protagonists as to the purpose of music and of being a musician.  Marais is after a brilliant career, with all the socio-economical advantages it brings, as opposed to a solitary, ascetic, and uncompromising Sainte Colombe who is searching only to perfect his art to an absolute.  He plays for himself only, and not on a stage, in front of a public, and certainly not at Louis XIV's Court. His love of music is unselfish and total, while Marais sees in the viol a means to an end.  Savall was careful in his choices of the pieces to be played by the two characters in order to illustrate their different approaches to music.  However, Savall chose Le tombeau des regrets, the piece Sainte Colombe composed for his dead wife, for Marais' ""last/first"" lesson from his Master, which they play together in a mutual understanding.  Their antagonism resolves itself in a final confrontation, which turns out to be reconciliation, as Marais finally understand the true meaning of music and that of being a musician.

Another theme is Death.  The first images of Sainte Colombe, showing him playing his viol at the bedside of his dead friend, identify him with funeral music.  In the recalling of Sainte Colombe's life, Marais presents his teacher as a man familiar with death: ""He viewed the world in the bright flame of the torch lit by the bedside of the dying.""  This baroque theme of the juxtaposition of life and death permeates the whole film.  The type of painting by Lubin Baugin (""Still Life on the Chessboard"") was called a ""vanity,"" a popular genre in the Baroque era, especially in Holland, and had a symbolic value connected to the Ecclesiastic quotation ""vanitas vanitatis,"" -- vanity of vanity, all is vanity, which is in keeping with this particular theme.  The message is to meditate on the world's pleasure as death threatens.  The opposition between life and death appears in the duality between the two sisters; one chooses life and the other chooses death.  The wife's death leads Sainte Colombe to close himself from the world and compose ""Le tombeau des regrets.""  And it is Madeleine's death which leads Marais to reaching his full potential as a composer.  Views of the blue pond, scene of death, alternate with views of the shack, scene of free improvisations.  As such, death proves to be a source of life, and art makes it possible to revive the beloved.  As Orpheus with his lyre, Sainte Colombe with his viol is able to recall his dead wife from Hades.  But in order to dispel any notion of the fantastic, before showing the apparitions of the beautiful deceased, the camera always shows Sainte Colombe's ecstatic look.  Finally, Marais, now an accomplished artist, can honor Madeleine's memory by playing ""La reveuse,"" transcending his pain in music and in dreams.",1154995200,38,11057,4.940508382909681
557245,5,6303042457,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since the technology was invented and finally it's here.  I saw this French masterpiece in 1991, back when I was a film journalist for the posh newspapers in the UK and the music and the mood have haunted me ever since.

The music is baroque viola - and a more moving sound you will never hear.  The mood is melancholic as a brilliant musician, Monsieur de Sainte Colombe, shuns society and the Court in 17th century France to mourn the death of his wife whilst his daughter mourns her abandonment by Marin Marais, her young lover who is also an ambitious musician.

The cinematography is stunning, painterly: a daub of red cloak by a dark, storm-lashed lake; a swirl of light and shade in interiors lit only by candlelight.  The pace is slow and meditative.  Jean-PIerre Marielle gives a brilliant, austere performance as Saint Colombe.  Ann Brochet is moving as his love-lorn daughter.  Intriguingly, the object of her desire is played for most of the film by the son of the man obsessed with her in Cyrano de Bergerac the previous year.

That's to say that Guillaume Depardieu - the callow, embarrassingly untalented son of the great Gerard - plays Marin Marais.  Gerard plays him in old age in a wonderful cameo.  (And the previous year a much more athletic Gerard had wooed Brochet in his own right.)

557246,5,6303042457,"This film is a feast for the senses--and the spirit.  The story is a fictionalized version of the apprenticeship of a famous viol player, Marais, in the 1600's.  His teacher, the legendary Sainte Colombe is a man who makes a spiritual discipline of playing music to the exclusion of nearly all else.  Sainte Colombe's talent is supposed to be so great that he can imitate any human sound. Yet he does not care about fame and fortune.  He shuns the frivolity of the French court of Louis XIV and even refuses to go to court when commanded by the King who wishes to hear him play.

Sainte Colombe fires his young disciple Marais despite his considerable talent.  Colombe states in essence that Marais' astounding techinical expertise aside that there is no music in what he plays.  Marais goes on to become court musician but still yearns to learn from the master.

This incredible story was filmed with precision and artistry.  Each scene looks looks like a renaissance painting.  The story is sad and haunting--clearly many of the characters are clinically depressed.  Yet somehow this film conveys an unearthly beauty and dedication to art that is inspiring.

Yet as the film hits the 36-minute mark and Gerard Depardieu's narration still hasn't given way to the plot, you're not so sure. Alain Corneau is not short of ambition and nerve as a director, as his opening seven-minute close-up proves, but since abandoning the thriller genre for the arthouse he's no longer a natural storyteller or a particularly cinematic one for all the quality of the visuals. He's not helped here by not having much of a story to tell - the betrayal of violist Saint-Colombe by his pupil Marin Marais seems to exist largely for a final confrontation over the very nature of music that promises more than it delivers. Unfortunately, Jean-Pierre Marielle's excellent but appropriately one-note performance as the stern musician only able to really express his emotions through music tells us everything we need to know long before we reach that point.

557291,4,6303042457,"Alain Corneau's 1991 film on the life of Marin Marais and his mentor, Christophe de Sainte-Colombe: composers prominent in 17-18th century France under the reign of Louis XIV. This is a good film in which the philosphical emphasis on music makes it perhaps a little slow in some parts.

  The film is about the upbringing and training of Marin Marais (Depardieu) who comes under the tutelage of Christophe de Sainte-Colombe (Jean-Pierre Marielle) to further refine his mastery of music. After a tragedy makes them part their ways, Marais becomes the King's court composer while Sainte-Colombe becomes a recluse on his estate. On a side note, Marin Marais replaced Jean Baptite Lully as the King's composer after Lully had a rather comical but tragic accident. While conducting a piece with the large conductor's staff typical of that period, Lully accidentally crushed his foot and later died of gangrene as a result. His death left the post open for Marais who served the Sun King until his own death.

  The film primarily focuses on the emotional and spiritual inspiration for music and how it's manifested by the composers. As both Colombe and Marais primarily composed their music for viola, the music tends to be somber and melancholic. The film seems to clumsily introduce a love-tragedy subplot to add to the tension but I wasn't impressed by that part. The music is some of the most touching music ever composed for viola and the film is worth watching for that alone.

  A very touching movie that treats music as a very spiritual and introspective journey into a man's soul. I strongly recommend it. For those who like classical music, I also recommend the beautiful soundtrack to this film: it's a gem!",1091491200,14,1714,4.923611111111111
557292,5,6303042457,"All the Mornings of the World, I really didn't get what the title had to do with the movie, but the movie itself is really beautiful.
This is the story of the 17th century composer St. Columbe, who was a master of the viola de gamba (or what I would identify as the viola di gamba), ancient cousin of the cello.  Very little is known of the real St. Columbe, so the movie takes poetic license with the man, based on his music.
Ste Columbe is an interesting study.  He is presented as no-frills type of guy. This plays in stark contrast to the gaudiness of the Courtiers who visit him, and want him to come to play for the King.  Ste. Coloumbe cannot be persuaded to come to court, earthly riches, fame and fortune mean nothing to him.  He is a man who suffered a great tradgedy with the death of his wife, who was in addition to his music,his greatest passion. Without her, he is half a man.  Nothing illustrates this better than his relationship with his unfortunate daughters, who suffer this half life with this thoroughly uninvolved father.
Because St. Columbe is miserable & disappointed in love, his daughters live like nuns, without any of the fun.
Entering this happy scene is the eager young student, played with a total lack of conviction by the pretty but wooden Giulliame
Depardieu.  Ste Columbe reluctantly takes on this student, but it's trouble from the get go, including an affair with the eldest daughter that results in her pregnancy.  The young man is kicked out, but goes on to great fame & fortune by joining the musicians at the Royal Court, ultimatly becomming the head man.
Meanwhile, back at the Ste. Columbe residence, the eldest daughter loses the baby, and starts a descent into madness that begins with anorexia and ends with suicide.  The younger. less sensitive daughter goes on to lead a normal life.
All the while, Ste Columbe indulges in his fantasies involving his dead wife, they meet very regularly. I have wondered why this woman doesn't take her husband to task for his rough treatment of their children, but she is always sweetness & light, nattering on about thier love life & his love for crushed peaches.
It might seem like I don't like this movie, au contraire!  Its a joy to watch. It's a tragic but interesting story, very sad. The performances by all are excellent, with the exception of Depardieu the younger.
The filmmakers use of natural light, including candelight is stunning, and the locations have a great feel of authenticity.  It might not be every ones cup of tea, but if you enjoy foregin films of this genre, it's definitley worth a watch.",1085443200,7,2598,4.640522875816994
557293,5,6303042457,"Whenever I think of the highlight of French filmmaking, I think of this film.  Absolutely gorgeous in every way: camerawork, art and design, audio and soundtrack, acting and direction and story - everything came together to create a truly beautiful piece of work.  One of my all time favorites despite a more than occasionally hollow performance by the younger Depardieu who proves that talent isn't always genetically transfered from father to son.  But despite the disappointment of Alain, the soundtrack and filmmaking are enough to make you forget any flaws.  Find the best television you can - hook up the highest quality VHS player you have - and enjoy.  Hopefully sometime in the near future we will see a Region DVD of this outstanding example of the French film cannon.",1084233600,11,778,4.953846153846154
557294,2,6303042457,"The music is superb in this movie. I give you that. But the movie is simply downright awful. To me this movie is about a man who becomes obsessed with the viola da gamba to escape the pains caused by the death of his wife.  His obsession not surprisingly drives hime to be utterly self-centered and bizarre.  He is a monster who abuses and neglects his whole family to focus only on himself.  He wasn't making music for us or for the world ... he was making music for himself but by luck his music making is also enjoyable to our ears. Otherwise most of us would recommend that he be locked up in an insane asylum.
If one were asked what makes a French film a stereotypical bad French film, one feature pops into my mind:  pretentious philosophical babbling.  And this film delivers a bucket full of it.  Ugh.
Get the soundtrack. Forget about this movie. This is my honest opinion.",1083196800,11,881,4.407407407407407

I may be ridiculed for this observation, but anyone who has read in the subject of Alchemy, may see a parable in this quest, that can be purified by the love of the art itself.  Or denigrated for the sake of the world.  Whether you view it from a mundane level or otherwise, this is a film that enriches the viewer.",1053302400,3,562,4.365384615384615
