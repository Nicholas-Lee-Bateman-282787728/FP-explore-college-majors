8691845,4,B00QL9MFB6,"This is a DVD that plays for about 45 minutes. It covers an historical event that has always been fascinating-Washington's crossing of the Delaware River.. The producers were trying to capture attention with the title of America's first D-Day, which is a bit ambiguous. They are attempting to bring more awareness to the historical sites associated with this event. It is pointed out how many historic places are closing from lack of interest and funds. So much associated with American history is not even covered in school curriculums.

The picture itself spreads off the screen and cannot be adjusted by sizing unless you have a large screen TV. There are no closed captions - always a disappointment with an educational film.
Much of the story is told by reenactments, but there are some very distracting talking heads popping in and out of the episode. There are some scenes with computer generated snowfall, yet the ground shows bright sunlit shadows and no snow landing on uniforms and heads.
With all this into consideration, this is still a good educational film regarding American history.",1438646400,2,1099,5.038461538461538
