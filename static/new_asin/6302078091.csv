420406,3,6302078091,"Richard Burton turns in a very strong performance, as usual, but the low-budget production values in this picture take it down a couple of notches.  There is nothing even approaching original German equipment.  In fact, the uniforms and equipment would have been unacceptable poor in a TV episode of the ""Rat Patrol"" made 15 years later.  The whole point of Afrika Korps desert warfare is that the uniforms and equipment have to be cool looking.
Frankly, this is not a film you'd ever need to see twice, much less own on DVD.",1085097600,6,525,4.684782608695652
420407,4,6302078091,"Richard Burton stars in this excellent war drama, directed by Robert Wise. James Mason reprises his role as Rommel, from ""The Desert Fox.""
I have to admit, I watched this in the hopes that I might gain some additional insight into the desert fighting in Iraq.
And I did. Even though this is a 50-year old movie, the desert scenes...the horrible reality of a ""war in a desert""...gives this film another subtext for the viewer, and makes it all the more gripping.
Yes, there are the standard war-movie subplots, but for the most part, there's a lot of uncommonly good elements to this movie. The Aussie aspect, the procedural details to the raids and attacks. It's constantly involving...

420409,2,6302078091,"This is just an average black & white war yarn concerning the defense of the fortress of Tobruk by a limited number of soldiers against the  mechanized force of Rommel.
If the writers of the script would have concentrated wholly on this enterprise, they most likely would have created an exciting, intriguing as well as thoroughly engrossing film. Instead they threw a monkey-wrench into the works by way of adding a completely uncomplementing and utterly useless sub-plot having to do with the drunken cowardice of Captain McRobert's (Richard Burton) former school teacher (Robert Newton), who is now one of McRobert's soldiers.
As a result, we find ourselves taken away from the battle at hand too many times, and forced to watch and listen to this irrelevant hogwash. Much too much film time is wasted here.

Also, although Twentieth Century Fox's transfers to DVD are virtually flawless in most cases, this is not one of them. The picture is a bit grainy, and the soundtrack is rather on the tinty side.",1022371200,29,1007,4.91764705882353

420421,2,6302078091,"Review of The Desert Rats
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

Oh, Richard Burton looks good in a uniform, his face a little sweaty and his cap tilted on his brow, conflicted about giving an order to his troops. He looks so very good. Thats pretty much the only reason why I sat through The Desert Rats, and probably why he made eight wartime movies after this one.

The Desert Rats isn't a spectacular war movie. It isn't bloody, it isn't particularly exciting, and it doesnt really have any plot outside the battlefield. Mostly, its about the strategy Richard Burton, his superiors, and his troops employ in order to stay alive in the middle of the desert before reinforcements can help them. James Mason plays a German bad guy, but hes only given a few scenes, so if its a James Mason performance you're after, skip this one. And if you're not really interested in strategy, you can also skip this one. Unless, that is, you want to look at Richard Burton in a uniform.",1500595200,,965,4.508571428571429

420430,4,6302078091,"Mason's key part in the film is short, involving an exchange with a defiant Burton.  The lesson given is that blitzkrieg doesn't work against a dug in defender that engages in guerilla operations.

420499,4,6302078091,"The Desert Rats, 1953 film

This takes place in 1941 Libya. Australian soldiers protected Tobruk against the German Army, which bypassed them on the way to Cairo and the Suez Canal. They were to hold their defense position for two months. The British General explains his plan: stop the infantry, allow the tanks to advance alone before they were attacked. Artillery shells explode. Machine guns and mortars repel attacking Germans. A lone enemy tank advances until it is stopped by a shell. Any decision by a line officer has consequences. They want volunteers on the front lines to stage attack raids at night. On July 9, 1941 they attacked an ammunition dump using captured enemy trucks. Grenades neutralize enemy machine gun nests. The explosive charges are set off to destroy the enemys supplies.

But some are caught. A doctor treats the Lt. Colonels wounds. The Field Marshall says his forces are nearing Alexandria and will arrive at Cairo. The Colonel says Tobruk prevents their advance. Airplanes machine gun enemy trucks; two prisoners escape. They must travel by night to return to Tobruk. Tobruk was attacked again and again by the Germans. The best and most experienced must hold a defense position. But they are running out of ammunition and soldiers. What will this company do? The enemy shells their positions. Later the sound of bagpipes identify the relief columns approach. They held out for 242 days, much longer than two months.

Did some of the battle scenes seem more authentic than similar scenes in American movies? A desert rat must spend much time underground in the hot desert to survive. This is a good story. Personal conflicts are used for added drama. To best appreciate this movie read a history of the war in North Africa. In January 1943 the American Army invaded in the west and advanced. The German Army retreated. The Allies invaded Sicily and advanced north. Rommel could win against superior forces because he concentrated them against a diffused enemy. He had a better source of information from his spies but was limited by a lack of supplies. The appointment of Montgomery changed that.",1454371200,,2130,4.96078431372549

Wise who also directed THE SAND PEBBLES, RUN SILENT RUN DEEP, UNTIL THEY SAIL, THE HAUNTING, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and THE HINDENBURG among others. Robert Wise developed a directorial style unique to each film. A consummate craftsman, Wise used whatever means necessary to present the story, its themes and characters, and always seemed to captivate and hold the attention of the viewer doing so. THE DESERT RATS is no exception to this. This is a first rate production and it is solid storytelling. Inexperienced Australian troops under the command of Captain 'Tammy' Mac Roberts, played stoically by Richard Burton, must defend Tobruk that stands between the Suez Canal and German Field Marshal Rommels Afrika Korps. James Mason reprised his role as Field Marshal Rommel in a more determined fashion that strengthened the production. The script took liberties with some specific events and circumstances and even some language idioms of the Australian troops, but delivered the overall story effectively. The small group of Australian troops had to hold against superior numbers until relieved and they bring the fight to the enemy to do just that. The legendary Lucien Ballard (THE WILD BUNCH, TRUE GRIT, HOUR OF THE GUN, NEVADA SMITH) was the cinematographer on this film. The cast of the THE DESERT RATS includes Robert Newton, Chips Rafferty, Torin Thatcher, Nicolas Coster and Bud Tingwell.

420673,5,6302078091,"Honestly, if you're going to get 'The Desert Rats', you may as well get 'The Desert Fox', or, vice versa. But really, even though 'The Desert Rats' was made after 'The Desert Fox', the latter makes a more practical sequel for a couple of reasons.....

For one, 'The Desert Fox' pretty much takes us from the North African campaign, then on to Rommel's life, till it's end. Secondly, 'The Desert Rats' is in somewhat rougher condition (print-wise), whereas 'The Desert Fox' is better, giving the appearance of a more recent production.
Also, if you think of 'The Desert Rats' as a sort of brief introduction to Field Marshall Erwin Rommel (his character is seen only briefly in this movie), then you may find the study of his personality more fascinating in 'The Desert Fox, after viewing 'The Desert Rats'. Even better, in both cases he is portrayed by James Mason. Interestingly, in both movies, Michael Rennie does some narration.

""The Desert Rats"" is more exciting, but 'The Desert Fox' gives us a very close look at Rommel, the man, whom you will soon see really was a good guy, in fact (unexpectedly) I was quite surprised to see one of the famous attempts on Hitler's life, very accurately portrayed, in 'The Desert Fox'! Rommel was one of the key figures who eventually wanted to rid Germany of Hitler.

The story was one of the valor of all comprising that battle group, which eventually made its way down to the most frightened coward of the entire brave force; who, in the end gave his life to save his brothers in arms so they could live a little while longer.

The story is one of Strategy and Heroism, as great as that of the Spartans at Thermopillae. The Allied General was as smart as his German Counter Part, rightly figuring out Rommel's plans and tactics to effectively thwart or reduce the affects of Rommels attacks. The movie titles should be reversed. The Desert Fox should have been the Desert Rat, because this group of Aussies, Brits, etc. lived and fought out of foxholes holding  off Rommel and his Afrika Corps for the better part of a year until reinforcements finally came.

420710,4,6302078091,"WWII spanned a fair number of years and theatres. The Pacific, Italy, Europe and, in this case North Africa. Each of these theatres was dotted by specific chapters that have made up the entirety of the war. This is one of those chapters.

Here's the scoop. The Brits are hemmed in by the Nazis in Tobruk, a sea port. They are asked by their superiors to hold on for three months until reserves can arrive. Three months stretches into seven and things are looking grim. They know Rommel is mounting an offensive. A Brit officer, played by the great Richard Burton, is put in charge of the Australian ANZAC troops and needs to thwart the Nazi offensive then, finally, hold a nearby hill until said reserves arrive. A daunting task to be sure.

This is a cool flick. As in most historically based films my guess is the broad strokes are true to the origin and the cracks are filled in with good writing to amplify the drama. That is done well here. Burton is a well trained officer put in charge of, what he considers, a bunch of rag tag Aussie brawlers. There is some animosity on both sides but, through the thick of it, each gains an enormous amount of respect for the other. A good job is done giving the viewer a sense of existing and fighting in the desert. Robert Wise's directing is efficient. He doesn't linger on the quieter scenes and doesn't overblow the action scenes. It's paced well and just steady overall. On the downside some of the sets looked like....sets. They didn't feel real. And the Germans had conversations amongst themselves, in German, without sub-titles. What's THAT about?! And these weren't two sentence conversations. They went on a ways. How was the audience supposed to know what they were talking about?

The encounter between Burton and James Mason (as Rommel) is exquisitely performed. The last stand, on a hilltop overlooking the road from where the British reinforcements are to come, conveys the real tension of men facing up to what they all realize to be 'their last day on this earth', as the Germans mount yet another attack. The ""skirl o' the pipes"" (the Scottish bagpipes) brings the film to a fitting close.

420717,5,6302078091,"Desert Rats

This is a fictionalized story of the defense of Torbruk by a green band of Aussies under the command of a British commander, Tommy (played by Richard Burton).

The Aussies are green alright, and they're grousing about their Brit commander and though they try to do the right thing, they're often chastised by Tom.  Tom is of the mind that disobedience to orders or to follow your heart, rather than being cold and calculating can mean death to the battalion.

Regardless, he softens a bit, especially with one of the men who used to be his school teacher back in the day, a man who admittedly is a coward, and who tries to guide Tom through this rough time.

James Mason reprises his role as Rommel, the supreme German commander.  Mason does not get a lot of ""air time"" in this film, but when he does he does it so well.  Unlike ""Desert Fox"", his commanding presence, and near perfect German is admiring.

The realistic war scenes, the bombs exploding, the death and sacrifice are as realistic as Robert Wise can make it.

This film reminds me of the old TV series, Rat Patrol.

Will an out-gunned and out-numbered force of green soldiers be able to out-match the superior German forces?  If they don't, the Germans will capture the Suez and thus take control of a major shipping and supply line to the Allies, and control the oil coming out of the Arabian Peninsula.  Not a good thing.

In watching these war pictures, one gets the feeling that we got lucky winning World War II.  If  it were not for Hitler's bungling, men like Rommel would have had the skill to take control of wide territories.

But we had Richard Burton!

420720,3,6302078091,"I wasn't quite as impressed with this film as the rest of the reviewers here. The Desert Rats was a rather quickly slapped together sequel to The Desert Fox, which I enjoyed much more. For anyone expecting to see much of James Mason as Rommel, don't hold your breath. At most, Mason's work added up to maybe 6-7 minutes of footage, about 90% of which takes place during a single scene. Parts of his appearances in the film could have just been outtakes from the Desert Fox, as they seemed rather disjointed and seemingly unrelated to the rest of the movie. His sole scene in English was not that impressive, and his German accent seemed to fall apart at the end of every sentence. Mason is one of my favorite actors, but this was definitely not one of his better performances.

Richard Burton puts in his usual, outstanding performance. He is in nearly every scene in the movie, it seemed, so the film would have gone downhill quickly without him propping it up. There were no other major stars in the film, so I'm guessing that it was no accident that he was so heavily relied upon.

As World War II movies go, this one was fairly fast-moving, with little time for character development outside of Burton's role. The Australian Army seems to be characterized as an extremely undisciplined, disorganized and stubborn lot, who couldn't have lasted five minutes in the war without Burton. How true that is to the original story, I have no idea. It certainly wasn't very flattering to the Australians though.

Unlike quite a number of other WWII films, this one seemed to forego any attempt to explain what the war was about, what the men were personally fighting for or who the enemy was. There is only a single scene of interaction with the Germans that involves any (English) dialog, so there really isn't much perspective insofar as the war itself goes.

If you want to see a great tour-de-force performance by Richard Burton, then by all means, go rent or buy the movie. If you are looking for an epic World War II movie, this probably wouldn't be my first choice.",1244332800,3,2066,4.62125340599455

He tries to persuade Roberts that his perception of his new troops is wrong .The movie focuses on the fighting -short ,sharp and intense -and the strains which the constant danger places the men under .It is a tough ,realistic movie about the Tobruk campaign which was to prove such a turning point in the history of the war .It conveys the intensity of the challenge facing the heavily ougunned Allied forces against numerically overwhelming odds .

Newton is superb as the philosphising drunk -alternately weepy,bellicose and bawling. It is a gift role and he milks it for all it is worth .There is a commanding  turn from Mason and Chips Rafferty and Charles Tingwell are impressive as Aussie soldiers .Robert Wise directs with authority and there is an award winning screenplay from Richard Murphy together with some sharp monochrome photography by Lucien Ballard

Burton is assigned to mold a group of green Australian recruits shipped into the besieged garrison of Tobruk during the 1941 offensive push of Fieldmarshal Rommel through North Africa.  The stern Burton is tough yet efficient but certainly not loved by the fun loving Aussies, who balk at his regimented ways.

Rommel played by the talented James Mason, who despite his Britsh roots utters most of his lines in authentic sounding German.  His German accent when speaking English holds up very well.  Rommel is compelled to conquer Tobruk in his plan to conquer Egypt and control the Suez Canal.  The troops deployed there however using underground shelters built into the flat desert landscape doggedly withstand the nerve wracking and continual artillery shelling.

They hold out for eight months styming Rommel's attempt to overrun their defenses.  Although ""The Desert Rats"" was released eight years after the war in 1953, the film serves as a tribute to the brave men that served there.",1134777600,15,1102,5.11731843575419

Facing overwhelming odds, the defenders of Tobruk, led by MacRoberts, have resorted to a series of hit-and-run raids ot frustrate the Germans while the rest of the British army regroups near Cairo.  Promised relief by the British forces, the besieged at Tobruk manage to hold out for nearly nine months against constant shelling and tank attacks.  Finally, at the point of nearly pulling out, the Australian garrison is finally relieved by the British.

Generally, I thought this was a slightly above average film.  James Mason's character of Rommel is hardly included in the movie at all; Burton's character of MacRoberts is the centerpiece of the film.  As for the battle scenes, they are somewhat subpar as opposed to other movies I've seen.  The action just isn't that great, and the actual combat lacks in authenticity and intensity.  Still, I did enjoy this movie.  Not knowing much about this specific theatre of combat, I did learn some things that I didn't know before.  Also, I thought Richard Burton did a credible job in his role as MacRoberts.  I think Mason's portrayal of Rommel was handled poorly, and I wish he could have been in more parts of the movie.  I think people will enjoy this movie.  It describes a lesser-known theatre of the war, and showcases how a small group of determined soldiers held out against a much larger enemy force.",1124928000,7,1974,4.7558823529411764
420731,4,6302078091,"The Desert Rats is an awsome film and should be watched by any War movie buff. Richard Burton is great as the tough MacRoberts and James Mason again plays Rommel to perfection. Even better there is a scene where Burton lectures Rommel on the importance on the defense of Tobruk. I was actually surprised at the quality of the battle scenes, the sound, the picture quality, and all the co-statrs were even convincing. The only annoying part of the movie is the feelings between the Aussies and MacRoberts but oh well its not that bad. This movie blew me away and I hope it does the same for you.",1112400000,3,594,4.458715596330276
