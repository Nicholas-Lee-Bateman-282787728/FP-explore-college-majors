204817,1,3812900319,"I LOVE Korean ""period"" TV and film.

But this was the worst and it really really really stunk. This tv series has no plot, no continuity, ugly actors, silly premises, and so many stock characters---only a few with a backstory---that it felt like i was in the checkout line at ""Trite Characters R Us.""
.
I see howeve that many others loved this show. So see it if you want to, certainly.
.
However, I recommend: FAITH THE GREAT DOCTOR, ARANG AND THE MAGISTRATE, MOON EMBRACING SUN, WARRIOR BAEK DONG SOO. There are others that are vital with plot, twists, character development (arc), Story and Story and Story.",1425513600,,610,4.648148148148148

Also, there were differences between DramaFever subtitles and this product's subtitles. Again, no biggie. Otherwise, loved the product.",1408406400,4,270,5.159090909090909
204820,5,3812900319,"I started watching this series on Dramafever, but about halfway through I decided that I needed to own it.  It has all the things that you love in Korean dramas.  Mystical beings, innocent girls, a really evil guy that you want to die die die throughout the series and two stunningly gorgeous male gumihos (nine-tailed foxes).

There's so much evil plotting going on by the bad guy it's amazing.  He's a man with a long term plan of evilness.  His evil plotting affects so many people in different ways.  People's lives and fortunes are destroyed by him.  He or his minions will kill or try to kill anyone that gets in his way.  I hated this guy so much throughout the series.  It was awesome!

Then there's the innocent girls.  The evil guy goes after them after destroying their families because he just loves to deflower virgins.  It's an ongoing theme with him.  Will they get true love in the end?  Will they get revenge in the end?  At the center of it all are the gumihos.  A father and eventually his son span the entire series.  One knowing all along what he is and the other not knowing until he's 20 that he's a nine tailed fox and what comes with being one.

There's a lot going on in this series besides the main plot, but these are weaved into the main story seamlessly.  All of the storylines are good.  The filmography is excellent.  The costuming is great.  The fx was well done and not obvious.  Overall, I loved this series and it will be one that I will watch numerous times.",1407283200,8,1495,4.395604395604396
204821,4,3812900319,"I was not expecting much from this show and only chose it because I like the male lead Lee Seung Gi. Well it is not an excellent show  with a lot of melodrama but it is also fast paced with lots of things going on all around, a good story with a good message that is not really that much hammered into the viewers' heads, an adorable male lead and a female lead just as cute. A cartoonish villain you'll love to hate and all in all a jolly good time for 24 episodes.",1399161600,,466,3.9574468085106385

204824,3,3812900319,"Sohwa is sold to a courtesan house after her father was framed as a traitor by her father's acquaintance, Jo Kwangung. Her brother and her close servant are sold into slavery. They plan an escape and Sohwa only survives because she's rescued by a 1,000 year old nine-tailed fox named, Wolyong.

Wolyong falls in love with her and decides he wants to be human. The Gu Family Book is the key for the line of nine-tailed foxes to become human. However, there are a few difficult and strict rules to follow. If Wolyong fails, he becomes a demon for 1,000 years. Eleven days before he becomes human, he shows his true form in order to save his love. But Sohwa is horrified and thinks of him as a monster. She betrays him and Jo Kwangung sends his men to kill him.

After his death, Sohwa finds out she is pregnant. She gives birth to her baby boy and leaves him with a monk, who will find a home for him where he can grow up as a human. Feeling guilt, anger, and regret for what she did, she tries to kill Jo Kwangung, only to be struck down by one of his men.

About 20 years later, the next story begins with their son, Kangchi. He has a good life surrounded by loved ones, until Jo Kwangung shows up and destroys their lives. Shortly after, he finds out from a monk that he is half demon. Kangchi is at a loss at what to do, until the tomboyish, Youl, helps him find his way. He ends up falling in love with her and wants to become human. But is history doomed to repeat itself?

This drama was okay in the beginning, but it got better as the show progressed. The story is interesting and is filled with action, romance, and magic. There are even surprises and twists in the story.

There are some things that I didn't care for though. Some of the special effects are not that great and look a bit outdated. Though there are really good actors in the show, some of their acting in certain scenes was a little bad. The extras and very minor characters acting was completely horrendous. The crying, yelling, shocked looks, ect... from them was so fake, it brought down the show a bit. I know they're not professionals, and are a very minor part of the story, (They are shown more frequently in this drama though.) but I've never seen such terrible acting. It was distracting. But if you can look past these things, then the show can be pretty entertaining. (Especially with k-pop stars in it.)

I had mixed feelings on the ending. There were things I hated about it and things I liked. But there was some sad, some unexpected, and some funny things in the end. I recommend giving this show a try. (24 episodes)",1389139200,3,2606,4.3408624229979464

7802257,5,3812900319,"I've had some slow packages lately, so I was pleasantly surprised by how fast the DVDs arrived. They were at least in the earlier half of the estimated arrival time, possibly a day sooner. Considering the small number in stock, I made sure to test all the DVDs first before reviewing. One disc had some shaky moments, but I can't be sure if that was from my player acting up or not. The discs' general quality was good, and I was very pleased with the clarity of sound and visuals.

One thing to note: These discs appear to come from a Chinese distributor, so the default language is Chinese, not the original Korean. Every time I put a disc in the player, I had to change the settings to Korean language with English subtitles. The subtitles themselves are not perfect. They contain several typos that are mildly distracting. However, the same issues showed up in the Drama Fever subtitles from when I first watched the show on Hulu. If there are perfect subtitles out there, I haven't seen them, so I wouldn't hold it against the DVDs' provider.

A brief summary of the plot: Kangchi, fostered by a generous merchant and raised as the son of the merchant's steward, finds his whole world collapsing when the scheming Lord Jo frames the merchant and seizes the estate of Century House. Forced to flee with the help of Youl, the daughter of a martial arts teacher and warrior with impressive fighting skills of her own, Kangchi tries to protect his loved ones from Century House from Lord Jo's cruelty. Things get even worse when he discovers he is half gumiho--also known as a nine-tailed fox--and half human. Youl helps him come to terms with what he is and seek the defeat of Lord Jo, as they navigate their feelings for each other and the many obstacles their relationship faces. All the while, there are whispers of a legendary Book of Nine, which may hold the key for transforming a gumiho into a man.

As for what I think of the content of the show...This is without a doubt my favorite Korean drama. It has a bit of everything. Action, romance, political intrigue, magic, humor, loyal friendship, tragedy, triumph, and history. The appearance of a real historical figure in Korean history--Admiral Li Sunshin whose ironclad ships helped end the 1590s Japanese invasion of Korea--is amazing in combination with a plot so steeped in myth and magic, and it's done quite believably. The gumiho are amazing. They don't have actual tails, but the forest guardian powers they have in this show a visual treat that also lead to some very tender moments. Viewers unused to the pacing of Korean dramas may wonder why the show starts out with a couple who are not the subjects of the main plot, but I find the contrast set up between the initial couple and the main one adds depth to both the story and the characters. The main couple also make some of the most mature choices I have ever seen in a Korean drama couple. There are traces of the more typical on-again/off-again romance with multiple break-ups caused by secrets and a general unwillingness to communicate that dominate the genre, but more often the conflict comes from outside events, which lets the characters trust each other more. All in all, more than worth the few flaws I found in the discs.",1490745600,,3258,4.662608695652174
