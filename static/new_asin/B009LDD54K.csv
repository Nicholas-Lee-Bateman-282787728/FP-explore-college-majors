5347057,2,B009LDD54K,"Season three of ""Boardwalk Empire"" boasts a fantastic cast and gorgeous production values. Unfortunately, the major storyline is a predictable tale of turf war between two gangsters - the sort of plot we've all seen 1,000 times before. So, in my (admittedly dissenting) opinion, the prodigious talent of the actors and designers is wasted on scripts that seem sophisticated on the surface, but are actually just lurid and unoriginal.

Perhaps the biggest waste of talent is the casting of Steve Buscemi as the chief gangster, Nucky Thompson - a thoroughly boring character whose defining trait is being really impatient with his subordinates (one wonders why anyone remains loyal to him!) Now, I really love Buscemi in movies like Fargo and Ghost World, where he gives wonderfully strange and funny performances. But why should I want to see him cast as a standard ""heavy"" in this series? He simply doesn't work in this context.

On a positive note, several of the other characters are far more interesting than Nucky. I particularly like Jack Huston as Richard Harrow, a sympathetically portrayed veteran, and Michael Shannon as George Mueller, who in this season works a demeaning job as an electric iron salesman. The sequences featuring these characters tend to have a lot more humor, heart and interest than the clichd gangster material.

But alas, for every good character in the show, there is a corresponding boring one. For example, I have little love for Gretchen Mol's bizarre madam character, who spends the entire season complaining that she doesn't have enough upkeep money for her brothel. Another weak point is Nucky's wife, played by Kelly Macdonald, who features in a storyline about starting a women's health clinic that shows promise but goes absolutely nowhere. The main villain of the season, meanwhile, is very entertaining but not terribly convincing; how would such a clearly unhinged guy ever rise to a position of real power in the underworld?

The quality of the show see-saws tremendously depending on which of these characters is heavily featured in an episode. But, viewing it as a whole, I found this season to be rather weak. Too many of the episodes are talky and dull, and when the ""action"" arrives, it usually takes the form of some tacky sex scene or predictable explosion of violence. In the end, the show feels more like a bad pulp novel than a truly intelligent drama. Frankly, I'd rather watch The Godfather instead...or The Sopranos, or Fargo, or maybe an old James Cagney movie. This show doesn't really bring anything new to the gangster genre.",1359676800,16,2588,5.011627906976744
5347058,5,B009LDD54K,"Even my wife,who usually eschews violence,was cemented to her seat while watching this on pay tv here in Australia.
How could anyone not like this operatic,Jacobean take on  the early prohibition years?
However ,we hope it is not the last of Nucky,Arthur,Chalky,our errant Federal agent now in the pay of Al,the depicable and self righteous hypocrite Margaret,and the rest of the damaged,revenging insane,greedy plotting gangsters,corrupt politicians and molls.
Boardwalk Empire deserves to go on its way through the prohibition years. Dare we hope the 'untouchables' and Hoover will arrive eventually with their machine guns too?
The sources are so rich and the quality of the writing and production are so good that the series could go on and on to at least series six or seven like 'Breaking Bad'.
How good of HBO to give usanother timely parable. Things haven't changed since their other fictional series 'Rome'.Life is still about survival and all the rest is the thin veneer of civilisation  and education which keeps us from complete anarchy.",1358380800,31,1049,5.201183431952662

5347060,4,B009LDD54K,"I decided to adapt the tag line for this season of Boardwalk Empire as the title of my review because I felt it was so appropriate for what was right and wrong with season 3 of Boardwalk Empire.  The show is at its best (and it is a riveting best) when it focuses on what the show is supposed to be about...gangsters and corrupt politicians jockeying for power, money, turf, and prestige in Prohibition-era America.  The show falters --significantly-- when it tries to be other things, namely...

<spoilers>

An exploration about how hard it was to get proper prenatal care for women in that era.  I know that the struggle to get proper education about birth control and how to manage a pregnancy may have been happening in the Prohibition era, and I salute the women and men who led the fight to get that education out there.  But it TOTALLY did not belong as a significant story in Boardwalk Empire.  I found myself fast-forwarding my Tivo whenever Margaret's character was visiting the hospital or giving classes.  It was totally disconnected from what the other characters were all doing in the series.

I'm actually starting to dislike Margaret's character overall and I found myself sort of wishing Nucky had killed her or discarded her when he found out she had been playing around with Owen Sleater.  I liked her fine in season one and some in season 2.  But she's getting a bit tiresome with her holier than thou attitude.  Besides, did the character seriously think she was going to be trading up by going with Sleater?  The man was a former terrorist, a gangster, and someone capable of strangling someone with piano wire.  Oh, and while he was canoodling with Margaret, he was also bedding one of the Thompson household maids ... which is something Margaret knew about.  Given that the show made a point of emphasizing how ""shrewd"" and self-taught she was, she comes across as a bit of an idiot.

I hope in season 4, Margaret either reconciles with Nucky and comes back to him and perhaps even becomes an active participant (consigliere of sorts) or the character gets written out...one way or another.

There are some other flaws with season 3 besides the ""Margaret Problem.""  I liked the actor who played Gyp Rosetti and I thought he was a pretty good villain. But they overplayed his uncontrollable violence.  I find it hard to believe a criminal who had so little control over his impulses to violence would rise very high as a gangster.  I could see him as a hitman or enforcer, but never as a boss.

I also have to gig Boardwalk Empire for leaving a couple of things rather unexplained (at least at the close of season 3):

1.  Nelson Van Alden's character and his ""nanny"" somehow seems to have gotten an upgrade where suddenly she's his wife.  It would have been nice if there had been a bit of back story to that.  I actually rather like the character of the wife, and I hope we see more of VanAlden as well as the Dion O'Bannion character who might become his boss.

2.  Another thing that I would have liked explained was why Capone came riding to the rescue of Nucky Thompson (which was done in a fantastic way).  Eli supposedly made a ""deal"" with Capone to do this, but couldn't they have given a line of dialogue explaining why Capone would have come all the way from Chicago to do this?

Now as for the good parts:

1.  I thought they did a good job tying Chalky White's character and criminal operation into the main story arcs.

2.  Arnold Rothstein and Masseria both come across serious potential opponents/sparring partners/partners for Nucky Thompson.  I hope we see more of Masseria next season in particular.

3.  The last three episodes were great when the series pretty much focused on the power struggle between Nucky and Rosetti.

4.  Gillian Darmody's character continues to develop as an unbelievably twisted and evil but also pathetic character.  I was truly taken by surprise by the ultimate fate of the young man who had a passing resemblance to her murdered son she had taken as a lover.

5.  I thought the rehabilitation of Eli Thompson as a major partner of Nucky was done well and was believable.  And the episode that focused mostly on the home life of the principal characters had some good scenes with Nucky and his brother.

It'll be interesting to see what season 4 brings us.  I really hope the Margaret character is either brought more into the storyline (like Chalky) or she's gone ... one way or another.  We'll see.  I just hope they keep the story focused on what's made Boardwalk Empire so compelling these past three years...murder, corruption, bootlegging, etc and not soap opera elements and women's health issues.",1355011200,20,4675,4.667074663402693
5347061,4,B009LDD54K,"This season of Boardwalk - in which Jimmy's warning comes back to haunt him - recounts a very bad year for Nucky while also developing the organized crime mythology of the time.

After Margaret's stunt at the end of Season 2, the Thompson's marriage goes on the rocks, with both eventually guilty of extramarital affairs, Nucky indulging first and most blatantly and Margaret's situation undoubtedly complicated by her daughter's polio diagnosis adding another hurdle to her easily leaving Nucky.  That is soon the least of Nucky's problems, however, with deranged Gyp Rosetti - played with scenery chewing relish by Bobby Cannavale - making a play for AC and sending Nucky into a battle for not only his power, but his life.

The series begins the process of developing historical figures like Meyer Lansky, Al Capone (Stephen Graham in a performance that has some fans making noises about wanting him to headline a series about Capone's Eliot Ness years after Boardwalk is over) and Charles Luciano (not so lucky yet) into the legendary figures that many people have at least a passing knowledge of.  It also does equally well with it's fictional characters, notably Michael Kenneth Williams' winning Chalky White and Gretchen Mol's increasingly disturbing Gillian Darmody.  Van Alden takes a bit of a backburner, but finds himself in the most deliciously ironic situation of the entire cast when he is around.  The heart of the series, however, is undoubtedly Jack Huston's magnificent Richard Harrow, who's the closest thing the story has to a hero in a world where everyone's morally ambiguous.  Mourning the loss of his dear friends the Darmodys, Richard couldn't care two cents for the gangland wars going down, but is rather focused on saving his friends' son, Tommy, from the influence of his psycho Grandma.  With the purest motive of any character in the story, it's Richard who we're rooting for all the way.  It says something about the twisted world of Boardwalk that the thing we most desperately want to see this season is a sniper getting custody of a little boy from his last remaining blood relative.

We also get a look at social issues such as the treatment of minorities as seen through the glass ceiling Chalky faces, what life was like for women before legal birth control (let alone abortions), and even - in some surprisingly heartbreaking scenes involving Capone and his little boy - the lack of resources for parents of special needs children.  The 20's might look fun on paper, but they probably still weren't a great time to live in for alot of people.

Finally, of course, there's Nucky himself, who this season finds himself at his most brutal but also doing some real self-assesment when he sees who stands by him at his lowest ebb.

Those who have been following Boardwalk Empire will find no reason to stop now.",1354492800,106,2846,4.904166666666667

5347070,5,B009LDD54K,"The five seasons of HBO's Broadwalk Empire, can be divided into three chapters: seaons 1 and 2 introduce the characters, firmly set them in the history of Prohibition, and concludes with the Jimmy Darmody storyline, season 3 stands alone, with the tale of Nucky Thompson's battle with Gyp Rosetti, and 4 and 5 are a long denouement, set against the closing years of Prohibition, the introduction and growth of the heroin trade, and the final rise of the historical Luciano-Lansky alliance.  To my mind, Season Three, Nucky Thomson's War with Gyp Rosetti, is the standout, the strongest and most dramatically satisfying of the three main 'chapters.'

5347244,5,B009LDD54K,"This season is by far the bloodiest as well as the fastest paced of the series.  I have to say it is my favorite as the story tightens like a ratchet to a mesmerizing ending that left me wanting more.

Nucky has plenty of his own problems with the season starts and they only get worse as his world of corrupt gangsters and politicians turn on him as well as one another.  The stand-out goon of this season is Gyp Rosetti who is one of the most menacing characters I have ever watched.  You don't want to offend this guy.  Believe me.  A deeply disturbed psychosis.

We also get plenty of Richard Harrow(one of my favorites), Nelson Van Alden(George Muller) and Nucky's new girlfriend Billy turns out to be the most charming female character of the series.

Seasons one and two are great but looks like mere preludes to this bomb shell.  You will not be disappointed.",1425859200,,867,4.471337579617835

Costumes, sets, and props well-researched and all replicas are beautifully produced.  For the nit-pickers, the only historical anomaly in the entire series is the appearance of Cutts Compensators on the M1921 Thompson submachine guns.  That, in itself, is the tiniest of quibbles.

The overall historical context of the story, in relation to US and world history, is just incredible!",1425772800,,497,5.4868421052631575

My Italian neighbor had it out with him several years ago when he was sunning himself in his back yard and didn't like the noise coming from her back yard (kids I think) and he sort of told them to ""shut up"".  When the mother heard about that she gave Steve an EARFUL...I wish I was there to record it.  I don't have to paint much of a picture for you to understand the type I mean (the mother).  Lots of curse words...My daughter could have babysat for him...very convenient location...He takes the ""F"" train into Manhattan and wears a black baseball cap when he wants to travel incognito.

5347594,5,B009LDD54K,"The third season of HBO's BOARDWALK EMPIRE picks up about eighteen months after the end of season two, with its shocking twist in the finale; it is now the summer of 1923 and Prohibition is firmly entrenched as the law of the land.  For Nucky Thompson and the gang in Atlantic City, it's means ever more opportunities to get even richer with their bootlegging empire, but with success, there comes a price, and before season three is done, every single major character pays in some way for the life they have chosen to lead.

The underworld created by the outlawing of liquor unleashes a truly predatory capitalism, where the strong devour the less strong (nobody is weak, because the weak don't last long enough to matter); for Nucky, the strong comes in the person of Gyp Rosetti, a prickly thug from New York who finds the Achilles Heel in Nucky's operation: the one lone gas station on the highway between Atlantic City and the Big Apple.  This sets off a gang war that rages through the bulk of the season before it reaches a bloody resolution in the finale; and not before Nucky finds himself in most desperate straits.  But as has been proven before, those who underestimate Nucky Thompson are fortunate if they live to regret it.

More than the previous seasons, this one is packed with subplots that stray to Al Capone's Chicago, Arnold Rothstein's New York, and Warren Harding's Washington D.C.  And swept along in these teeming second stories are such familiar faces as Mickey Doyle, Nelson Van Alden, Charlie Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Esther Randolph, Jess Smith, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, Chalky White, Owen Slater, Gillian Darmody, Capone and Rothstein, and two new faces: Gaston Means, a fixer and bagman for the corrupt Justice Department and Andrew Mellon, the Secretary of the Treasury.  If any one character stands out, it is disfigured veteran Richard Harrow, a cold blooded assassin, who nevertheless, commits the one truly unselfish act among all these amoral characters when he tries to do right by Tommy Darmody, his one true friend's orphan son.  Harrow's blood soaked rampage in a bordello is one of the series most compelling scenes so far.

Then there is Nucky's on the rocks marriage to Margaret Schroeder (she donated his big highway windfall to a hospital at the end of season two); the writers have her character all over the place in season three.  Is she the guilt ridden wife of a gangster, or a foolish adulteress, not to mention a crusader for women's access to reproductive education and birth control.  This storyline is all over the place and my patience with it was sorely tried by the end of the season.  I thought it was clear that Margaret knew what she getting into when she married Nucky in the first place, and if it was a marriage of convenience, then she should have gotten her priorities straight, especially concerning her two children, one of which has been crippled by polio.  I also didn't care for Nucky's romance with a would be Broadway star, their scenes together being the least interesting of the entire series, much less this season.

At the center of all of this is Steve Buscemi as Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson, still the smartest man in the room.  I think Buscemi has some of his best moments in the later episodes, when his gangster rivals have him on the ropes and on the run and out gunned, forcing him to use his wits.  Buscemi also has some great moments with Shia Whigham, as Eli Thompson, former sheriff and now ex-con, who is forced to start over at the bottom in his brother's operation. Kelly McDonald's Margaret didn't have happy moment in the first two seasons and she does no better in the third.  Jack Huston is a revelation as Harrow, since he has to do much of his acting with only half a face and a rasp of a voice.

But the big acting job of season three falls to Bobby Cannavale as Gyp Rosetti, if not exactly the Big Bad of the season, certainly the Big Worst of the lot.  Cannavale goes over the top in this part,sneering and snarling his dialog while committing mayhem on many an unwary bystander and playing Gyp like he just stepped out of an old Warner Brothers gangster epic from the 30's and 40's; to ice the cake on his depravity, the writers give Gyp a particular sexual peculiarity-one that is sure to turn some people off.  Far more sinister to me were Ivo Nandi as Joe ""the Boss"" Masseria and Michael Stuhlburg's Arnold Rothstein, men who don't shout because they don't have to, because everyone always listens when they talk. Stephen Root makes a welcome contribution as Means, a forerunner of a now familiar Washington insider-the man who gets called on to get things done.  It's a treat for Root's many fans and James Cromwell's Andrew Mellon gets to give a very succinct comment on Prohibition and the mentality the brought it about.

I would like to have seen more of Michael Shannon's Van Alden, the former Treasury agent who has somehow gotten himself hooked up with the Chicago mob; they do give Van Alden a great meltdown that would make General Zod retreat.  It could be said that calling Gretchen Mol's Gillian a scheming whore would be a complement, she's that good as a hard to like character; except for the daughter of an embittered veteran whom Harrow romances, there are few sympathetic women in the show.  Nick Robinson shines in a brief role as a brash teenage liquor thief who runs afoul of Nucky.

The writers and directors, especially Terence Winter and Tim Van Patten, really make the 1920's come to life, with a shout out to the set and costume designers, this show is a treat to watch on Blu-Ray.

In many ways BOARDWALK EMPIRE reminds me of those old Harold Robbins novels that were big bestsellers way way back in the day; I can remember reading a few old dog eared paperbacks when I was a teenager.  They were mostly period pieces filled with sex and melodrama.  BOARDWALK EMPIRE also makes a great companion to THE SOPRANOS and BREAKING BAD, in that these shows tell us where organized crime in America came from and what it became.

Season three ends in the summer of 1923, which means there is still a lot of territory in that explosive decade to explore.  Because of the Depression and World War II that followed, the third decade of the 20th Century was looked back on fondly with much sentimental nostalgia as the century wore on, but this show makes it clear that the ""Roaring 20's"" was a time of epic venality, corruption and hypocrisy; underneath all that prosperity and good times was a deep undercurrent of cynicism and disillusion. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Nucky and all the rest of the gang.",1405987200,,6647,4.666095890410959

5347622,2,B009LDD54K,"I waited almost 2 years to watch season 3 since they killed off James Darmady in season 2's Finale.  I don't understand why they killed off the most interesting character and best actor in the entire series.  I must say I didn't miss much.
I found myself struggling to make it through some of these episodes but felt obliged to because i had spent the money on buying the season.
This season lacked the character development and overall story development that held such an amazing presence in the first two seasons.  I don't understand their continued focus on Margaret Schroeder/thompsons downright annoying and boring character.  She really takes a lot away from the exciting fast paced mood of the first two seasons when they spend as much time as they do with her....
The first two seasons represent one of the best TV series i have seen, this third one isn't really worth watching...I could have used spark notes and bought the 4th season instead.

I really don't understand why there are still so many good reviews for this season.  From a true but honest fan of this show, I cannot give my props to this season but I hope the following seasons capture the original excitement of Boardwalk Empire.",1404086400,,1203,4.704761904761905
5347623,1,B009LDD54K,My rating of Boardwalk Empire Season 3 is based solely on the technical problems with the Blu-Ray DVD.

5347783,5,B009LDD54K,"I am assuming that readers of this review are familiar with the series so I won't bother to recap here. With each episode I find myself more riveted by bootleg, political boss ""Nucky"" Thompson, et al. Thompson is superbly played by Steve Buscemi).

Season three of Boardwalk Empire opens on the last day of 1922.  ""Nucky"" throws an extraordinarily party to welcome in 1923. His shindig is a huge success. The guests are delighted with the Egyptian theme and expensive gifts. Singer, performer, comedian, dancer, actor and songwriter, Eddie Cantor, (portrayed by Stephen DeRosa), brings Billie Kent, (Meg Steedle), with him to provide musical entertainment. Ms. Kent is a recurring character in the third season of Boardwalk Empire. She is a young Broadway actress, a bit of a floozy - and ""Nucky's"" new mistress. Newly empowered, and enriched, the undisputed king of the Atlantic City rackets can certainly afford the expense of such lavishness. Why a mistress when he has the always stunning, intelligent Margaret, (Kelly Macdonald), as a wife? His relationship with Margaret is very tense especially after she signs his highway jackpot over to the church. Anyway, back to the party... as always, the costumes are stunning, and the music is fun. The acting, direction, writing is all top notch, and the plot is the best so far.

Nucky has cut a lucrative distribution deal with New York gambler Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg). Unfortunately he has a new competitor. Giuseppe Colombano Rosetti, nicknamed ""Gyp"", is a main character and the primary antagonist in this third season. Gyp is a violent and unpredictable Sicilian gangster, sensitive to slights...no matter how slight...no matter if the ""slight"" is all in his psychotic head. And when ""Gyp"" blows his top, someone usually dies, quite violently. Just before midnight Nucky assembles his bootlegging contacts in the kitchen. He tells them that because of the attention on the Harding administration he is going to be supplying Arnold Rothstein exclusively. Rosetti is outraged and storms out, after going berserk and delivering a tirade of abuse on Nucky and his associates.

Former FBI agent Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon), has fled to Chicago after committing murder He has a new job as a door-to-door salesman However, fate has other plans for him. J. Edgar Hoover would be apocalyptic at Van Alden's behavior. How did he ever pass screening??? This guy is a real psycho also...but I guess one would have to be to think and do what these characters do.

I miss Jimmy Darmody, (Michael Pitt), but my favorite character is war maimed, sharpshooter, Richard Harrow, (Jack Huston). He is back with a greater role to play. Richard is Jim Darmody's old war buddy and became his driver after the war. I imagine, given his shooting skills, he also guarded Darmody' back. After Darmody's unfortunate and untimely demise Richard continues to raise Jimmy's orphaned son, Tommy Darmody, as though he were his own child.

With the exception of Darmody, all the regulars return and continue with their adventures, or misadventures. Nucky's brother Elias ""Eli"" Thompson, (Shea Whigham); a young Al Capone, (Stephen Graham ); Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano, (Vincent Piazza); Albert ""Chalky White, (Michael Kenneth Williams); Edward ""Eddie"" Kessler, (Anthony Laciura); Commodore Louis Kaestner, (Dabney Coleman); Owen Sleater, (Charlie Cox); Johnny Torrio, (Greg Antonacci); etc.

Frequently the female characters appear to be stronger, smarter/craftier and more subtle in the ways of manipulation than their male counterparts. They don't use guns...they use their minds. All are back this season: Margaret Thompson, (Kelly Macdonald), formerly Schroeder, n&eacute;e Rohan, was a young Irish widow, a mother of two, and now ""Nucky's wife; Gillian Darmody, (Gretchen Mol), is Jimmy's mother, an old friend of Nucky's and the beautiful ""Madam"" of a classy house of ill repute; Gillian is  very saavy about power and can play the ""power game"" with the ""big boys;"" Angela Darmody, (Aleksa Palladino), is Jimmy's wife and the mother of his young son.

A major part of the series includes the story of a twenties gang called ""The Combined"" or ""Big Seven Group."" ""Boardwalk"" incorporates these historical figures in Season Three. The biggies on the east coast are part of it and it is multicultural, as crime is. Seven different gangs: Sicilian, Italian, Jewish, and Irish come together to bring people booze during Prohibition. They also bring a little bit of smack or ""something in the sack."" This group is the precursor to the National Crime Syndicate of the 1930s. The Big Seven includes Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano's, (Vincent Piazza), and Meyer Lanskys, (Anatol Yusef), operations as well as Enoch ""Nucky"" Johnson and Abner ""Longy"" Zwillmans outfits from New Jersey, Moe Dalitz's from Cleveland, Waxey Gordon's Harry ""Nig"" Rosen's of Philadelphia, Danny Walsh is the representative for Providence, Rhode Island. Johnny Torrio, (Greg Antonacci) is a kind of consigliere. A very young Al Capone, (Stephen Graham), is too busy dealing with the North Side Gang. However, Capone does attend the Atlantic City Conference of 1929. And Giuseppe Masseria, ( Anthony Quinn ), is best known as ""Joe the Boss."" He is also known as ""the man who can dodge bullets"" because he survives a multi-gun execution attempt on Bowery.

I highly recommend this gripping series, especially as it is now available on DVD. You can watch the entire series in a few sittings.

5347788,2,B009LDD54K,"Gave this as a Christmas present to someone. I didn't watch, so this review doesn't reflect content, but the manner in which it was obtained (in short: with difficulty). Had trouble with UPS; they required a signature. This was during the weeks around Christmas in which I was involved with family and not around to sign for it. I finally got the notifications the day before it would be sent back and had to drive out to the warehouse for pickup. Upon opening it, there was damage to the slipcover and the shrinkwrap was torn, as it was mailed in a box too big with no kind of packing material to cushion.
The recipient later told me that one of the discs was defective, a problem they had never encountered with a Blu Ray before. No matter the machine, the third or fourth disc skipped so much they called it unwatchable. They asked for a replacement, but as we were separated by distance and under a time limit in order to get recompensated, they had to send it in instead of me.
I later learned that they could only get a cash refund in order to then re-buy a new copy, and by then the price had jumped by $10.
Minus one star each for these three factors. Terrible service.",1390521600,,1177,4.3545454545454545

5347810,5,B009LDD54K,"I am really enjoying this series, now almost completing the 3rd season. A good show draws you in such that when an episode ends it is a bit of a surprise. Using this yardstick, I did not notice a decline in season 3, as many reviewers indicate.
Then again, I do not need a story to be fast-paced to keep me interested.",1390262400,,318,4.145161290322581

We finished watching the third season (I usually purchase for us for Christmas) and I immediately went online to see when Season Four would be available!

It is a great series and well worth the money.  I don't even wait for a discounted DVD.  I purchase it at full price because I want to see it as soon as it's available.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!",1390262400,,526,4.316326530612245
5347812,3,B009LDD54K,"i could pick this season apart but i'll spare the details and just mention that the show really changed directions at the very end of season 2 and continued with this new theme through season 3. it's almost like you can feel the screen writers wondering how to wow the audience and grab ratings. lot of blood, lot of death, lot of brutal. sadly, there just isn't a realistic feel to it anymore. not that it's by any means a bad show, it's just that characters like nucky thompson, who were loosely based on nucky johnson, now have completely entered the realm of 100% fictional TV.",1390262400,2,581,4.490566037735849

5347815,4,B009LDD54K,"Did they not have gas cans in the 1920s? It seems that with the amount of money being thrown around among the various gangsters that some gas cans might have been in order maybe around, say, Tabor Heights? The wad of cash they threw at the law enforcement thereabouts would have been more than enough to cover 1 truck and 1 guy devoted entirely to the purpose of refueling the fleet mid-trip.

This would not be such an issue, to me, if this ""fuel trouble"" did not end up igniting the war that ensued between Nucky and Rossetti. There are just too many strange gaps in this 3rd season. Season 1, 2, and 4 are much more complete.

The Rossetti character needed more depth and more background to justify his important role in the third season.",1390089600,,741,4.4411764705882355

5347819,4,B009LDD54K,I like the politics behind it but my goodness the violence and the nude. In this season there are episodes with scenes of nudity that didn't even make sense or related to the plot. After a while it gets boaring b/c there is only one guy who can run things but we all know he wouldn't stay on top that long. But it can be entertaining and makes me grateful I'm alive now vs the 1920's.,1389657600,,384,4.065789473684211

5348032,5,B009LDD54K,"""Boardwalk Empire: Season Three""
(HBO, 2013)
. . .

This year, I've found myself disappointed by several high-profile cable dramas -- notably, ""Dexter,"" ""Nurse Jackie"" and to a lesser extent ""Breaking Bad,"" which was still strong going into the home stretch, but a little bit wobbly in the first half of the final season.

Not so with ""Boardwalk Empire.""  Fueled by Steve Buscemi's seething performance as uber-antihero Nucky Thompson, the series is probably the most consistently high-quality show on cable TV, circa 2013. The level of writing, acting and production matches the taut, flawless, compelling drama of ""Deadwood,"" and ""The Wire"" -- exhalted company where the show's producers never hit lulls and refuse to coast or pad things out. The program is always compelling, the writing is concise and well-structured, and everything you see on screen looks great. The only weak spot comes with the over-the-top portrayal of Bobby Cannavale's gangster character, ""Gyp"" Rosetti, but even with the oooh-he's-into-kinky-sex tedium, Rosetti is a truly terrifying, menacing antagonist, and Cannavale puts in one of his best career performances with this meaty role. Overall, ""Boardwalk Empire"" isn't just a winner, it's a stunner. Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)",1380758400,,1290,5.467336683417085

5348080,3,B009LDD54K,"I loved the first two seasons of Boardwalk Empire.  Absolutely loved every episode.

I found Season 3 to be extremely slow and boring.  For example, a very large percentage of time was spent on Margaret starting a women's health clinic.  Really?  Boardwalk Empire?

I felt like I was sleepwalking through the whole season.  Something would happen, then everything would drift along for a while at a snail's pace, then we'd spend some time in one of Margaret's women's health care classes, then everything would drift along for a while.  All in s-l-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n.  There were a couple episodes where we watched Nucky listening to the phone ring (over and over and over again) because his latest mistress wasn't answering.  That's annoying in real life -- don't need more of it on tv!

There were odd storylines that didn't really go anywhere, e.g., Teddy and the greenhouse fire and the ""gypsy man.""

Some of the gangster/bootlegging stuff was pretty good (Gyp Rosetti was definitely a raging maniac), but a lot of it was predictable...and slow.

I found myself looking forward to the Agent Van Alden/George Mueller sequences and the Richard Harrow sequences.  They were the most fun in Season 3.

I hope Season 4 picks up the pace.",1380585600,3,1233,4.888888888888889

5348187,5,B009LDD54K,"I liked the nice, tight way all the disparate story lines and characters are intertwined.  The acting is excellent all around.  I continue to be amazed at the superlative production values. For example, the sets and the costumes, almost like it was filmed in the 1920s.  The cars all look a bit too clean and shiny for the time and place, but I'm certain their modern owners wound never stand for any distressing of such a valuable and irreplaceable relic.  I was disappointed that Eddie was left wounded on a table with an uncertain prognosis and nothing more was said about his fate. Does he recover and return in Season 4?  He deserves more recognition than he's gotten until now.  In spite of being a rather mousy and long-suffering background character, he is actually a very brave man. Something I never did quite figure out is why Nucky shot the smart Aleck kid he holes up with in the basement of the booze stash house.  Was it  simply because the kid was an obnoxious punk who was too smart for his own good?  With so many principal characters either dead or out of the picture, how will Nucky go about reclaiming his position as the power broker of Atlantic City?  Can't wait for Season 4.",1379721600,,1199,4.534883720930233

This season I just noticed that it was it little more brutal and violence. Especially with the character Gyp he was crazy and mad.

5348276,1,B009LDD54K,"Some series lose their way; the 3rd season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE has successfully done that. The HBO series has some powerful names involved; Whalberg, VanPatten and Scorsese, but their names only lent money to the production and not quality. The props, costumes and filming are superb but the storyline is a disaster. You can almost tell where one of the producers said, ""We need to add some black actors"" and a scene using the contracted black actors is added. Characters from prior seasons appear out of nowhere and disappear as suddenly. If you haven't seen the first two seasons (even with the added 14 minute intro)you have no idea who they are and their place in the production. The part of the season that I found so absolutely insulting was the generous use of perverted sex scenes that were nothing more than the writers either living out their sexual fantasies or ""sharing"" with us their actual sexual practices. The scene where a small boy is exposed to adults engaged in sexual intercourse was absolutely unnecessary and added NOTHING to the storyline, which as I said, is wanting, fragmented and loses even the most dedicated fan. Hollywood writers assume viewers are ignorant and cannot see the obvious politically correct slants to their characters. All the blacks are ""righteous"" and ""justified"" in their anger at being held down by the whites--that highly exaggerated line has become very old.  The personal relationships are mostly based on adultery, betrayal and manipulation; we aren't even given a few decent love stories or decent human characters. The Hollywood writers contempt for Christianity is slipped (snuck) in with smug hidden little innuendos like the iron salesman who was a devoted Christian turning into a nut case.

The storyline started out in season 1 with bootlegging, political corruption, gangsters etc.--and ended up with nothing more than gross perversions and absolutely no ""heroes"" (the good kind) for the viewer to identify with--sad at best.

Great costumes--great props; horrible storyline. Season 3 proves money does NOT create quality productions.",1377907200,6,2096,5.176991150442478
5348277,3,B009LDD54K,"I looked forward to watching this so much that I blew through the entire season within a few days, only to find myself seriously disappointed with the quality of script-writing by the end: there were more than a few earmarks of work by some hacks who pen those masterpieces of turn-your-brain-off pablum - ""action/adventure"" films - washing over the season like waves from the Atlantic.

WARNING! ""SPOILERS"" OCCUR FROM HERE ON...

While there were a ""boatload"" (seems appropriate) of plot problems this season - these I found the most ludicrous:

- while I understand the writers wanting Margaret to see Slater's corpse for dramatic reasons, does it make any sense that, with the heightened security and  paranoia following the bombing, a crate would be BROUGHT INTO NUCKY'S PENTHOUSE AND OPENED - as if there couldn't possibly be anything dangerous in it?

- the scene where Harrow rescues Tommy from the brothel was preposterous in the sense that he could enter a roomful of armed (Rosetti's crew had just been abandoned by Masseria's in the middle of a ""war"" - think they'd be standing around without guns?) men all around him and take them out before they got him - that would be ridiculous even for a man with both eyes! It was also pretty convenient that the guy holding Tommy hostage wasn't literally doing so, offering Harrow a clear shot.

- forget the logistical issue of Tonino managing to contact and meet up with Gyp and some of the remaining crew in the middle of nowhere; he's able to give a (viscerally-pleasing painful/slow, at least) dispatch to him - with no resistance from the others.  Afterwards, we find that Nucky and Eli have followed ALONE (that's very trusting - or foolish) to a nearby spot, and are willing to accept Tonino's word that a man trying to kill them is dead - without any proof being offered.

- then there's Van Alden, whose co-workers must have decided to write off his blow-up to office ""horseplay"", as there's apparently no need for him and his family to relocate - even within Chicago.  The murdered agent's complaint about his aside, that's quite a high-quality iron - stays hot and steam-filled for a very, very long time...

I could go on and on, but I don't want to waste any more of my time on Season 3 - it did a fair job of that already.",1377907200,4,2290,4.6600496277915635

Steve Buscemi is absolutely one of the best actors around. The operatic quality of this production is simply enthralling and captivating.

I care more about the characters, this season!  The person who plays the mother of Jimmy was excellent, and I really liked what they did with her.  We, actually, gasped out loud, a few times.  I LOVE the character of the ex-government employee who used to confiscate alcohol, and what they have done with him!  Just LOVE that!  We really look forward to seeing the 4th season.  I hope there is one, because there is definitely all kinds of room for these characters to grow.  I want to find out what happens to them!  This season was super high quality and very entertaining.  I liked it a lot more than the second season, which kind of lost my attention.  My attention is way back!",1377475200,,831,4.352941176470588

If you are considering shelling out nearly $40 (Amazon's price; $80 retail) for Season 3 of HBO's gangster drama, then you already are a fan and already know ""Boardwalk Empire"" is some of the finest story-telling on television.

And, Season 3 will not disappoint you.

It opens 16 months after the end of Season 2 with a bang -- a senseless killing by bootlegger Giuseppe Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), who is Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson's (Steve Buscemi) new rival. Rosetti has a plan to cut Atlantic City, and Nucky, out as a supplier of booze to Prohibition-era New York City. And it ends with a bang as full-scale war breaks out between Atlantic City, New York and Chicago gangsters.

The body count is high in Season 3 as the scriptwriters send real-life gangsters Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein and Joe Masseria to war.

No drama set in the Roaring Twenties would be complete without a flapper, and Season 3 offers the beautiful Billie Kent (Meg Steedle) who steals Nucky's heart as his marriage to Margaret (Kelly Macdonald) becomes a sham. Even as the marriage falters, Season 3 continues to use the Nucky and Margaret characters to tell a differing slice of the Irish experience in America.

Season 3 offers the expected outstanding performances from Buscemi and Macdonald. To that, add Cannavale's unforgettable psychopath, Rosetti. Also, in Season 3, Gretchen Moll and Jack Huston get to expand the storylines for their characters Gillian Darmody and Richard Harrow, respectively.

Bonus features include actor and director, including Martin Scorsese's, commentaries of the season; newsreels of the historical gangsters; and Creator/Executive Producer Terence Winter's recap of Season 2.

5348307,1,B009LDD54K,"I saw it advertised in our local paper for $34.99 and I paid  $44.86 to Amazon for it.  I am a member of PRIME, free shipping, and if there was a price correction in the past on a preorder, I was always treated very well.  NOT SO on this.  I AM NOT HAPPY!!!  Packaging and delivery were great as usual but AMAZON, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FOR THIS.  ALSO FOR NCIS SEASON 10 --  SAME THING  -- found it in the local paper for almost $10.00 cheaper than what I paid AMAZON on a preordered item and my account has not been credited for any difference as has usually been the case.

I AM DISAPPOINTED AND AM RETHINKING CONTINUING WITH AMAZON. I HAVE BEEN A FAITHFUL CUSTOMER FOR YEARS!!!!!!",1376956800,3,689,4.198473282442748
5348308,5,B009LDD54K,A great period piece about a time that I first heard about at my father's knee.  A fine cast of very fine actors well cast.  Steve Buscemi is the star and the reason I watch.  He has the ability to make you root for him even though he is an evil bastard.  When I first went to Atlantic City in the 70s it was still controlled by gangsters and I think I saw Nucky's spirit at the Sands.  This show is a history lesson made appealing.,1376956800,2,432,3.9767441860465116
5348309,5,B009LDD54K,Boardwalk Empire is becoming one of the truly Great TV shows it continues to keep you guessing and raising the bar.  Season 3 was very important after the events of the Season 2 finale fans were skeptical about how they would proceed but it didn't disappoint it exceeded expectations.  For me this is my new Sopranos the show I look forward to every Sunday it's like an event.,1376006400,2,376,4.514705882352941
5348310,5,B009LDD54K,"A lot of people were worried that Jimmy's absence would hurt the show. It didn't. While the first few episodes were a bit slow, it pays off at the end, and it's another great season. The climax of this season has the gangster feel that I would say has been missing from Boardwalk Empire a little bit in previous years. I can't wait for season four!",1375056000,,348,4.287878787878788
5348311,5,B009LDD54K,"I pre-ordered this dvd. I really enjoyed seasons 1 & 2, so I can't wait to see season 3. Steve Beschemi does a great jobon this series. It's not as good as Breaking Bad or Dexter, but it's still .good",1373587200,,200,4.025

5348313,5,B009LDD54K,"I began watching this series after season one. I bought the first two seasons and will soon own the third season. This is five times better than the Sopranos! The life like costumes, the music, the scenery are so original as to be there as the series develops. The characters are all so fabulous and the history so close to what really happened during prohibition that it is difficult to separate the late 1920s in your mind. If the producers and actors choose to let this run the course through mid 1933 there could be many more years of this outstanding series to be seen. If I recall, at the end of the third season the time was just starting out in 1925, and Rothstein, a real life mobster has just been busted by the government as Steve Buscemi's character evades the trap set for him by his enemies. I simply cannot wait for the premier of season four in September!
