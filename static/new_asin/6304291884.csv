7867289,3,6304291884,"""Day of the Warrior"" is conceptually ""The Dallas Connection II"", though here Andy took back the directorial reins from his son Drew. This is classic Sidaris, and if you have seen any one of his movies, you know exactly what to expect: a ridiculous ""plot"" full of holes, pretty women, pyrotechnics, and acting bad enough that it would make Ed Wood blush. Having said that, this one is more enjoyable for lovers of cheesy movies than other later Sidaris films, mostly due to two things: Cobra (Julie K. Smith, easily the prettiest Sidaris actress since Hope Marie Carlton left the stable, and Elvis Fu.

This one has no discernible plot, so after a while I honestly stopped trying to figure out what was going on. Little makes sense here, but that's going to be OK with most viewers who are familiar with the Sidaris oeuvre. The movie opens with an insanely preposterous conference about how there is a compromised computer security code; this has backstory from ""The Dallas Connection"" but it's no great loss if you didn't see that first. All of the secret agents are in deep cover doing assignments all over the world, but central to the plot (as usual) is good versus evil, and here evil is a bad professional wrestler in face paint (if you care, which you won't, this is explained) who smuggles artifacts, art, gold, and pretty much everything else though he still has an Oedipus complex (see the face paint discussion).

Since I'm apparently incapable of fully comprehending the finely crafted storyline nuances, I will just say that there are numerous subplots that go nowhere: there's the formulaic Sidaris pair of idiotic assassins (they have graduate degrees from Harvard) that bungle everything they touch, there's a hot blonde involved with diamond smuggling, there's a tiny subplot about murdering an owl (!), but best of all there's Gerald Okamura as Elvis Fu, the world's worst Asian Elvis impersonator singing his heart out in Vegas and on a riverboat. Elvis Fu is a jarring element here, but you will not be able to contain your laughter: it made the movie for me.

There's a whole subplot about the bad guy (""The Warrior"") illegally duplicating videos for worldwide distribution (Can they please not copy this one?), and other tangents about why it's smart to wear black leather pants in the Dallas heat, not to mention the stealthy bulldozer assassins, which have the least plausible way ever of knocking off their intended targets. Ultimately there is a lot of innuendo, predictable double-crosses, and the worst tag team match in wrestling history.

""Day of the Warrior"" is the least lucid of the twelve Sidaris movies I have seen, but it's also one of the most over the top and enjoyably ridiculous. If you like Andy Sidaris and have a sense of humor you'll be most pleased.",1470096000,,2793,4.836820083682008
7867290,5,6304291884,"Well, I didn't actually watch the movie, but my hubby, son, and a friend of ours went camping in our RV.  We drove all day, so I was tired and went to bed. The Camper was one similar to a pop-up, no bedroom door, just a curtain, and the TV was right on the other side.  The guys put this movie on, and every time I was just about asleep - they would break into fits of laughter.  I was not a Happy Camper - lol.  They woke me up at least 10 times.",1459728000,,447,3.723404255319149
7867291,3,6304291884,"A entertaining T & A action flick by Andy Sidaris with plenty sex , nudity  , and explosive action to shake a stick at. No the acting is not great but it  will hold your attention through the whole hour and half believe me.  Julia Strain and Shae Marks show off their useful assets in this flick. Check this movie out if you love sex and action.",1418428800,,345,4.119402985074627
7867292,4,6304291884,"Day Of The Warrior is another Andy Sidaris BBB movie, and I enjoyed it. It has it's campy moments, it's funny moments, and it's sexy moments. And there's lots of shooting and explosions. Plus, it has Julie Strain in it so you know it's got to be good!",1301961600,,251,4.25

7867294,4,6304291884,"Yes! This movie contains absolutely no plot, okay, okay... It does... But we see these kinda movies for the wonderful, sexy babes, not the plot, hehheh. Shae Marks looks incredibly yummy on this flick, But I wish they  would have gave her more than 2 nude scenes! BOO the Director! I would like  to end this review by saying... Shae Marks has some luscious looking  breasts & some yummy, mouth-watering buns!",947808000,6,408,4.71830985915493
