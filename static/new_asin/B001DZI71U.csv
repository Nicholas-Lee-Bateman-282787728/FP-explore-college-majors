3543733,5,B001DZI71U,This dvd was great. My husband and his parents speak German to our kids and they understand what they are saying but always answer in English. We own other DVD's to help our kids with German but this is the 1st that got my daughter to speak German -not just understand it.,1304899200,,272,4.25
3543734,5,B001DZI71U,"I am not sure what it is about this DVD but compared to the ""My Baby Can Read DVDs"" this one seems to hold her attention best.  She is now 18 months old so I am not sure if she is catching on to the Spanish yet, but when they say papi on the DVD she says papa...it's cute!",1304553600,6,272,3.610169491525424
3543735,5,B001DZI71U,"I bought this DVD for my toddler almost 6 months ago. He loves to put it on, repeat the words after the DVD, copy any movement the children in the video clips do. He seems to retain what he hears too as he uses the words later.

 My copy has quiet music that doesn't overwhelm the spoken German.  The classical music in the background I think adds a pleasant layer to the DVD I haven't seen in other baby/toddler German DVDs.

Even my LO's grandparents like for me to send this DVD over when visiting. It's not flashy. It is much slower than other DVDs like Little Pim and there's no storyline like Muzzy, but if you enjoy slower-paced children's shows like Mister Rogers Neighborhood you'll probably enjoy this DVD.

I wish Bilingual Baby would release a second volume.",1298851200,15,770,4.510791366906475
3543736,5,B001DZI71U,"We absolutely love this video. It keeps our 15 month old's attention and is very easy to understand.  The pace and slow moving, simple video reminds me of a Baby Einstein video.  The DVD covers a lot of common words, colorful pictures and videos.  Would definitely recommend.",1288137600,16,275,4.808510638297872
3543737,3,B001DZI71U,"This video is very very simple and basic. Sometimes your not certain to what they are talking about. It does show in the lower right hand corner in english words what it is. However my biggest complaint is the background music is louder then the person pronouncing the word. You have to really turn up the volume to hear them and have no other noise in the room.

It didn't keep my childrens attention at all.",1276646400,8,409,4.381578947368421
3543738,5,B001DZI71U,"I don't own the actual DVD but I will soon. We get a 9 minute video of this on our freezone and my 7 month old absolutely loves it! We bought your baby can read and we can't even get past the first word without loosing his attention, but he will sit and watch this whole video without a peep. My son will already be bilingual as I am, and my side of the family speaks english and my husbands side is completely spanish. To me it is important for our son to speak many languages, and what better time to start than now while his brain is a sponge.",1276041600,5,546,3.9727272727272727
3543739,5,B001DZI71U,"My daughter and I go through this DVD multiple times per week. She is six months old, and it holds her attention.",1359072000,,113,4.181818181818182
3543740,3,B001DZI71U,I think the show could be a bit more interesting or engaging. But I like the repetition of new vocabulary and the use of new words in small simple sentences. Very good for small children who want to learn Spanish,1357603200,,212,4.325
3543741,4,B001DZI71U,bought my nephew this DVD (he's 22 months) and my sister says that he is already counting in Spanish and knows his colors in Spanish. no one else speaks spanish in the house so he is picking it up just from the DVD,1357344000,2,214,4.0
3543742,5,B001DZI71U,"My daughter really loves it, watch it again and again. The DVD is every useful to catch her attention. The words is usually used in kids'life and is easy to remember.",1355616000,,166,4.387096774193548
3543743,4,B001DZI71U,"it good for babies they are held by the voice and like the pictures, good idea have since bought other products from this co. and have found they to be high quaility and will buy more in the future.",1353888000,,198,4.102564102564102
3543744,5,B001DZI71U,"I love this but most importantly is the fact that my daughter absolutely loves this DVD...it's nothing fancy, but if she loves it I do too!!!",1353715200,,141,4.461538461538462
3543745,4,B001DZI71U,"I brought this DVD for my 1 year old because he hasn't said his first words yet. Our first language is Spanish. At first he didn't payed attention to it but after a few days he loved it. Now he gets very excited and dances when he hears the introduction music and looks like he is hypnotized when he is watching it. I don't know what is with this DVD that absolutely captures his attention. We have been using it for one month and he still doesn't say any word. He does do ""No"" with his head when they do it in the DVD. Lets see what happens...",1352246400,,544,4.046296296296297
3543746,5,B001DZI71U,"This DVD is fantastic. The ideas are presented clearly. I've purchased many language learning DVD's for children over the years and this is by far the best way for a young child (age 1 and up) to start to learn a new language. I just wish the creators would do an intermediate level DVD as well, they have done such a good job with the beginner level. Highly recommended.",1351900800,,371,4.391304347826087
3543747,4,B001DZI71U,Ok for what it is . My kid just got bored. But we speak Spanish in our home I was just trying to get her to learn how to roll her r's better and other pronunciations.,1345334400,,166,3.638888888888889
3543748,2,B001DZI71U,"This DVD was just very dull. I got it for my son when he was a little over 1 1/2 years old and he never watched more than a few minutes of it at a time. Naturally babies don't focus for long, but he will sit and watch several minutes of Dora and other shows like that which are designed to hold a child's attention.

Honestly I also found the DVD quite boring and never watched the entire thing either. I also tried to play it for my 4 year old nephew and he hated it.",1345334400,,468,3.875
3543749,5,B001DZI71U,"the baby named logan masters was extraordianary, probably the best baby actor i have ever seen. The way he absorbed the material was outstanding. Its like nothing i have ever seen before. He deserves endless amounts of applauses and hugs and kisses.  s",1344470400,,252,4.8604651162790695
3543750,5,B001DZI71U,"This product is awesome, I am very happy with it. It has a wide range of
vocabulary words & visual images to help your child associate the correct item
with the correct Spanish words. Also compiles sentences so child gets use to
listening to it.",1335052800,,245,4.466666666666667
3543751,4,B001DZI71U,"I was skeptical about this DVD at first, because it seemed rather low-budget, the background classical music is a bit too loud, and the scenes/clothing are dated. However, this has become a favorite DVD of my 19-month-old boy. I first introduced it to him when he was about 9 months old. Now he actually requests this DVD and will be quite mesmerized by it. This says a lot because he generally hates watching TV/videos and won't sit for very long. I know he is retaining information from it, because he has started counting to ten in German along with the DVD. The topics and scenes move in a fairly random sequence, but the pacing is slow enough and the pronunciation is very clear. I wish the price point was a bit cheaper, but I would still buy this DVD again (I may have to because our original is now very scratched from frequent use). For reference, I also use Little Pim, and my son likes them equally.",1332979200,,910,4.455089820359281
3543752,5,B001DZI71U,"This DVD is SPECTACULAR!! I love it!  And 18 months old baby loves it too.  Very been studying Spanish since 3 months along with other Educational tools - Baby I can read, Abc's, colors, counting, shapes and general book reading. Both in Eng/Spanish.  I just love this DVD, cause it goes over a lot of what we've been learning, plus more things that I was wanting to learn.  It goes over colors, counting, manners, hello/bye, many objects.  The backround music is pleasant - classical type, production, excellent done, clear precise great pace, very easy to understand  narration,  not only does she speak the words, but then you see the spelling on the screen, and she makes sentences, and shows it on the screen as well - in small print English! It's great!! And 45 mins is perfect for children 1-5 as it says.  There was no disappointments at all with this DVD.  A book would have been nice, to go over what was mentioned in the DVD, but I'm still ok on what I've got.  We have plenty of books already, but it would have been nice if one was included.  The DVD did not cover body parts at all, but it covered plenty, so I hope they will make a series that cover that plus other key words as well - and I will look at their web site to see if they do!  Thanks for the DVD!  Oh also, I was going to order the Brainy Baby Spanish DVD - but it's put out by the same company, and after reading the reviews, ( I could be wrong), but it looks like most of the same words are covered in as this DVD,  and  I wouldn't want to make a purchase to get basically the same thing twice.  So, I'll see if I can find something else from this company.",1324166400,6,1636,4.19551282051282
3543753,5,B001DZI71U,My 20 month old loves this dvd. She has learned all the colors and a few additional words as well as counting to 10 within a matter of a couple weeks after watching this. I just wish there was a second dvd ;),1323043200,,208,3.86046511627907
3543754,5,B001DZI71U,My baby loves this dvd.  He is one now and has been in love with this dvd since about 5 months.  It holds his attention.  It is simple.  When the dog and kitten appear he points and grunts at the screen.  A good buy.,1322784000,,216,3.8181818181818183
3543755,3,B001DZI71U,"This video is not my favorite, but it's better than others I've seen. My 3 year old seemed to enjoy it pretty well. I like that it has real pictures, real people, and not just drawings. The background music is kind of overpowering which I don't like. It's not very entertaining for kids though, I can see how they might get bored watching it because there are no games, action, dancing, etc. It's just pictures or videos of something with a description. I however, am learning some. :) I have a few other Spanish video's for my child and they are my ultimate favorite because of the interaction, dancing, songs that my kids love and sing along with, and the puppets they use. That is what I was hoping for with this video, but did not get. Still a pretty good video though.",1321574400,4,773,4.4125874125874125
3543756,1,B001DZI71U,"I've been putting this on occasionally for my 3 year old for several months but he is still just not interested. It's quite simple so it might be good for those much younger but for any child that has been exposed to colorful cartoons (even simple PBS shows, like my son) this will be boring to look at. It's so low budget I can't even stand to watch it myself. And where are the articles? They may not be necessary in English but they certainly are in any language that includes them.",1311292800,4,485,4.282608695652174
3543757,5,B001DZI71U,I have never ritten a review but after my 7 year old watched this dvd for 2 weeks it left me with no choice. My sos did not know a word of spanish before this dvd. Now 2 weeks later he knows so much i am amazed. I let my son watch the DVD once a day for the pass 2 weeks and now he is ready for a more advance lever. my 2 year old also amases me because he watches the DVD as well and now he is counting to 5 in spanish. great DVD.,1307404800,5,431,3.4536082474226806
3543758,1,B001DZI71U,"I ordered this DVD ""Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby German"". However, the company DIRECT USA sent me the wrong thing ""Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby English"". I don't need the DVD to teach my kids English. I contacted the company about this issue through Amazon but never got any response. I wasted $12 dollars. This is the worst online purchasing experience I ever have.  Please never buy things from DIRECT USA.",1306886400,2,404,4.855072463768116

8295554,2,B001DZI71U,Doesn't hold my son's attention. Too slow and outdated/weird.,1410134400,,61,5.888888888888889
8295555,1,B001DZI71U,I like the idea of the dvd but when I actually played it the background music was so loud that you can not properly hear the person speaking. I think that even no music would be better that this. Little disappointed.,1400284800,,216,4.2926829268292686
8295556,4,B001DZI71U,"Great way to learn a little beyond basic Spanish. It's very engaging, my 17 month old loves this Spanish dvd",1400025600,,108,4.45
8295557,5,B001DZI71U,"Mom and Dad find this video boring, but the one year old and three year old are enthralled.  That's what counts.  The three year old even drops German words in for English ones and he doesn't even realize it!",1375747200,,208,4.3076923076923075
8295558,5,B001DZI71U,"I love this DVD. My kids watch it when we are in the car. My twins that are almost 2 can speak more German than English (they only can say 10 words or so in English and we are a English speaking house), they can count to 10 in German. My 4 year old repeats everything they say on the DVD. This is one of the best German DVDs I have bought. I wish they made more.",1370304000,,362,3.7142857142857144
8295559,5,B001DZI71U,"I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter. She loves it very much. Everyday she looks forward to Spanish time and she would ask me to play the dvd over couple of times.

This DVD covers colors, numbers, name of objects, salutations and daily use words ( drink, eat, sleep, play etc)and using those words in sentences.

I like:
1. They are slow giving few seconds between words.
2. English meaning is given in small font for few seconds.
3. Words are repeated.
4. There is a sequence where  only Spanish words are shown.

After 3 months she can count in Spanish, knows few words. My 4 year old picked up the words in couple of weeks, he watches the video once a week now to retain the words he learned.",1366243200,3,705,4.318181818181818
