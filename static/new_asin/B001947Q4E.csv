3422537,5,B001947Q4E,"Wow Wow Wubbzy is another great example of why Nickelodeon is a parent's best friend on the television.  When I was growing up we would watch PBS and catch the antics of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers.  Today we have entire channels from Nickelodeon like Nick, Nick Jr. and Noggin.  These channels give us age appropriate programming that is enticing and engaging.  I especially like the early childhood shows on Noggin and Nick Jr as they are rarely controversial and teach good lessons for my kids.

My kids have several favorite shows.  My oldest loves SpongeBob, How its Made and Tom and Jerry.  My middle child loves The Backyardigans, Lazy Town and Little Bill.  My youngest loves Dora the Explorer, Blues Clues and Super Why.  All of them enjoy Wow Wow Wubbzy.

What makes this cartoon especially engaging across ages from 3 to 7 (in my house) is the fact that the characters cross a wide range of interests.  You have the ""inventor / Widget"", ""bookworm / Walden"" and of course the always playful and inquisitive Wubbzy.  Wubbzy is definitely the main character and he reminds me a bit of Curious George to be honest.

The DVD is a great transfer of 8 titles plus a few nice extras like print outs and music video.  It is great to finally have the option to get this great show on DVD.

Pros:
1. Great lesson teaching cartoons.
2. Short and to the point.  No loss of attention for the youngsters.
3. Engaging and funny.  Never a dull moment.
4. Nice music and score.
5. Well voiced.  The characters really come alive with the voice over's.

Cons:
1. Animation is a bit too simple and computerized for my taster.  My kids don't seem to mind so perhaps this is just an inherent prejudice on my part to modern cartoons.
2. Although the Kickety-Kick Ball gags are fun for the adult in the room they get a bit old after the 6th or 7th viewing on the same day.  (I am kidding here.  Anything gets tiresome the 4th or 5th time the kids want to watch it).

This is a great program, a great DVD and would be a great addition in most personal collections for families with children.  I recommend without any reservations.",1222732800,,2116,4.4934383202099735
3422538,4,B001947Q4E,This is a great video.  Several episodes in one DVD.  My 4 yr old loves the wubbzy show.  Great values in the stories.,1222732800,,118,4.043478260869565
3422539,5,B001947Q4E,"I got the opportunity to review this courtesy of the Amazon. Vine program.  Upon receiving it, when I opened the package with my children, they exclaimed:

 Erik (age 7) ""Wow! Wubbzy rocks. I have been watching this on Noggin.""

 Kyle (age 5) ""I love Wubbzy.""

 As I began to watch the episodes, Wubbzy grew on me as well.  Wubbzy is a loveable character that gets into everyday problems that he attempts to resolve in a creative, non-violent way.  Let me list the episodes:

A tale of tales
Special Delivery
Widget's Wild Ride
Attack of the 50 Foot Fleegle
Come Spy with me
Wubbzy Tells a Whopper

And, two bonus episodes:

Mr. Fizzy Pop
Puddle Muddle

Also, their are bonus features:

Bonus Music Video
Ring Toss Game
Fun Printables
Previews

Out of all of the episodes, the title episode ""A tale of Tails"" is our favorite.  Wubbzy is made fun of because of his tail, and he attempts to change it in a variety of funny ways (making it into a branch, changing it different ways in a machine) before he realizes that he needs to accept his tail as is because he can't get rid of it.  Eventually, he has so much fun with his tail, and can do so many different things with it, that he is accepted by other playmates in Wuzzleburg.
I enjoyed this DVD with my children.  It is definately for the pre-school/young learner set.  I would highly recommend.",1222732800,3,1348,4.473251028806584
3422540,5,B001947Q4E,"When we saw that Wow!  Wow!  Wubbzy was coming out on DVD both of my children (ages 5 and 2) begged me to get it and we have not been disappointed.  Wubbzy is a fun and quirky creature who always looks to find the positive along with her two best friend Widget, who can build anything and Walden, a book-smart little guy.

This 92 minute DVD release features a total of 8 episodes (each is about ten minutes long).  I won't give a full description of each episodes as so many other reviews have done so but each episode is like an up-to-date aesop fable, complete with a positive moral about accepting differences, listening to directions, trust, patience and so much more.

The shows are quirky and fun and kids (at least mine) adore Wubbzy and her friends.  They have ripped the DVD out of my hands and have already watched it quite a few times and are asking when the next DVD is coming out.  Enjoy but beware that the theme song will stick in your head -guaranteed.",1222646400,,969,4.374301675977653
3422541,5,B001947Q4E,"We are so glad that they finally came out with a DVD for purchase.  We have waited a long time and really enjoy watching all the episodes on this DVD over and over.  My 3 y/o son loves the cute characters and I love the lessons that Wubbzy teaches about how to be a good friend that respects others, obeys rules, and is happy with who he is and what he has.  It is not easy to find shows that are appropriate and that the kids love this much.",1222646400,,442,3.943820224719101
3422542,5,B001947Q4E,"Our daughter enojoys Wow Wow Wubbzy and I will say the show is cute. I love it when the characters say Koohy.. While one should not just plop your kid down in front of the TV for hours at time, a few episodes at a time will not hurt.

Wubbzy and friends (Widget and Walden) go on many adventures with Wubbzy being the character that learns manny lessons along the way. The Widget character is very good with tools and creatse many gadgets that help Wubbzy overcome the issue at hand. Walden is a book smart character and provides the level-headed solutions. I would not consider this a real educational show but it does provide educational lessons in each episode. Wubbzy tends to lie at first to cover the mistakes and does finally come clean. Some of the lessons learned on this DVD are it is OK to be different and never play with someone else stuff unless you ask first.

I will not go into a break down of each because it has already done and there is a good chance that you may have seen most of these episodes while watching them with your kid(s).

I rate it 5 stars for fun and enjoyment with some educational value.

I recommend this DVD to parents with kids in the 3 to 8 years range.",1222473600,,1194,4.293333333333333
3422543,5,B001947Q4E,"Oh, how we love the Wubbster.

My 5 year old and 2 year old just love this show. We enjoy the music, the catchy songs and lyrics (just you try not to sing these around the clock!) and the easily understood lessons that come with each episode.

The characters are happy, different, and surprising in their characteristics. A girl that is the handyman, a boy that is the nerd, and a joyful, playful 'kid' that is Wubbzy.

Highly recommended from all members of my family.",1222300800,,469,4.4941176470588236
3422544,5,B001947Q4E,"Hooray!! I, and my children (3 1/2 years and 20 months), are thrilled that they have put out a Wubbzy DVD. They just love this show, the characters, their adventures and the songs at the end of each episode. This DVD is sure to make its way into their video rotation. And it's good entertainment for them, that I too don't mind watching as well.",1222041600,,345,4.323076923076923
3422545,5,B001947Q4E,My grandson saw a few reruns of this cartoon and loved it . I was able to find this DVD and he loves it.,1373414400,,104,3.375
3422546,5,B001947Q4E,"I have to say that I used to really like cartoons. I can't tell you how many nights I'd laugh, till I almost cried with my parents when the Road Runner did it again to Wile E. Coyote. I loved Elmer Fudd's speech, Donald Duck's too. This is no cartoon I could love.

But my four-year-old nephew loved it to death. I don't know, have times changed? I wouldn't have liked this at four, I know I wouldn't have. So I've got a dilemma, how oh how do I rate this? I didn't like it at all, not one little bit and I still like cartoons, still watch DVDs of Bugs, Daffy and the Looney Toons gang. So what to do, what to do?

I don't know, this just didn't seem creative to me. Still, what do I know, because as I said, my nephew loved it. So I guess I have to do an average here, one star from me, five from him and that makes three.

No, I guess my nephew wins, because as I'm writing this, he's watching with the little girl who lives across the street and they're both enjoying the heck out of it. Go figure, so five stars, the kids love it and I guess that's what counts.",1369267200,,1065,3.967289719626168

3422556,5,B001947Q4E,"My daughter is a very big fan of ""Wow Wow Wubbzy"", so much that when I do turn the TV on, if Wubbzy isn't on she will get very angry.

I don't feel the need to list off all the episodes included, as many other reviewers have done so. Needless to say, Wubbzy is an ideal show for younger audiences. The colors are captivating and it's simple enough that a two year old can comprehend it.

It's a lighthearted series that covers many issues that teaches small children the DO's and DON'Ts of everyday life.",1244678400,,504,4.294736842105263
3422557,4,B001947Q4E,"I bought this DVD for my 26 month old son.  He loves it.  It flows very well from the beginnning to the end.  The only drawback is that it doesn't have the autostart feature, which makes it tough to watch in the car.",1243641600,,216,3.9767441860465116

I bought this DVD for my 15 month old son after reading several other positive reviews on Amazon and seeing how much he liked the other Wubbzy DVD.  My son loves the music and I like the stories and the fact you can change the language to either French or English for him.  They are really good lessons for when he's older and can understand them.  For now, he just loves watching the characters and listening to the music. I would definitely recommend this DVD to my friends.",1238803200,,606,4.2894736842105265

Keeps him entertained and he enjoys watching it.  The loves to hear the tunes in Wow Wow Wubbzy to the point that he gets up and dances.  So at least i know my son is not being a couch potato but he is also being active at the same time.
I too like to watch it with him, it's a very cute show that tells you about morals and to do good things in life.

3422570,3,B001947Q4E,"Wubbzy lives in a delightful world of color, and uniquely shaped characters set him a part from the wave of CGI animation. He can easily appeal to all age groups. A sensible, non preachy message is mixed within the commotion of story lines!
Action often comes from the crazy Rabbit, Widget. As mechanical engineer Widget is constantly creating. His creations 3,000 all have their kinks, which Buddies Wubbzy, and scientific Pal Walden try to get on the right path.  Leading to multiple kooky adventures.
Pros:
Lots of extras:
*DVD ROM Toss Game, Printable Features like coloring and party invites, Stickers to stick inside open DVD Case, Coupons  off Chuckie Cheese Restaurant, and other kid and parent approved places, and services.
*Eight fun filled episodes.
* Silly, yet educational music video, encouraging children to respect other's personal belongings. Another suggests kids should be themselves, with one of the episodes going further into depth with this topic.
*Navigate easily with menus.
* Few movie previews
 Cons:
*Theme music and show intro repeats, with each episode....
* As with many cartoons there comes  repetitiveness. One of two exist here, an orange character has resemblance to Wubzy. His/her walks/ runs/ enters in the heat of suspense. ""Kooky"", is all the creature will say.
Widget's inventions are a huge aspect of the show's hysteria! Both a plus, and minus, depending how you look at it!",1230163200,,1417,5.147826086956521

3422572,3,B001947Q4E,"Our almost-2-year-old daughter is absolutely fascinated with Wubbzy. In fact, we use the DVR to tape new shows on a regular basis. Having the DVD is nice, but not a deal-breaker for us, because the shows are all the same shows we've seen repeatedly on Noggin. The only really good thing about the DVD is that we can take it on car trips (we break out the DVD player as a last-resort when said daughter is on the verge of a meltdown).

If you don't have the opportunity to watch Wubbzy on a regular basis, then it's a great DVD to have. Otherwise, there really is very little point to owning it. I'm hoping that we can get others soon that might have a few new episodes!",1227830400,,669,4.267716535433071

We've seen this episode before, and my daughter just stands in front of the tv.  It's an adorable show geared specifically for preschoolers.

It is very fun and educational at the same time. Wubbzy frequently displays a wonderful 'don't give up' attitude even when things don't go as expected. Wubbzy's colorful world is full of oddball shapes and characters, keeping kids entertained and having fun. Because of that, I would highly recommend this title to any parent looking for quality, fun programming for their preschooler.",1226966400,,680,4.675

With the help of pals Widget and Walden, he tackles everyday kid problems so he can pursue such interests as chasing flutterflies, eating ice cream and playing his favorite game, kickety kickball. Widget is a mechanical whiz and inventor who owns her own fix-it shop, and Walden a bespectacled fellow,loves music and art and is a quirky scientist.

3422579,4,B001947Q4E,"I was given the opportunity to watch and review Wubbzy's first release on DVD. Having a one year old I thought I'd give this a try. So glad I did.

In times in which kids watch cartoons like Sponge Bob and the like (filled with absurd situations, jokes that sometimes may not be directed for kids and characters drawn in odd ways) Nickelodeon offers a fresh TV show: Funny and colorful characters, catchy tunes, cool flash animation and educational on values rather than colors, numbers, etc for preschoolers. And I guess the latter is what I liked the most, every episode has a situation that Wubbzy and friends have to resolve: ""A tale of tails"" talks about the importance of accepting yourself the way you are and look; Another episode has Wubbzy telling a lie (the episode ends with a catchy song ""Lie, blame it on the other guy"") and in the end he understands that when someone lies the truth will eventually come up; then there's this episode in which Wubbzy opens a package that does not belong to him (with another funny song ""look, look, look, don't touch!"") and I guess you get the idea.

My kid loved this and danced to the songs while pointing and laughing with the characters from the show, as a father, this is the kind of TV show I'd like him to watch (though eventually he will choose what he likes and what he doesn't)

The episodes run a little over an hour. The DVD comes with a 3D cover and does not include subtitles at all (though it is closed captioned), language tracks included are English and French. Some of the extras include the isolated song videos as well as two bonus episodes.",1225670400,,1609,4.5034246575342465

3422581,4,B001947Q4E,"Adults and older kids shouldn't try to watch these cartoons.  The characters deliberately speak slowly and repetitively to get the really young kids up to speed.

3422583,5,B001947Q4E,These Wow wow Wubbzy shows appeal to my 5 and 2 year old making it a great compromise. No annoying music to hear in background so mom likes it too. Cooper and Lilly give it a two thumbs up .,1224892800,,190,3.775

I do not see much educational value in this. There are far better videos for teaching numbers and letters that can be just as amusing. Still, for once in a while and variety, this is a good DVD to have for young kids. Over 5 I think they will not be interested.",1224720000,,498,3.98
3422585,5,B001947Q4E,"I was impressed with this cartoon series. First off, the theme song is catchy and fun, and each episode is laced with fun background music behind the cute and easy to understand dialogue. The graphics are clean and colorful and overall has a simplcity that I find refreshing. Each episode runs back to back, easily keeping a child's attention. I would say that this is perfect for kindergarten age children and younger.

An especially nice feature was the cool packaging, which included a colorful 3D holograph scene and helpful details about the episodes and extra features.

I found myself sucked into the adventures of Wubsy and Widget. My favorite episode was ""Attack of the 50-Foot Fleegle"" where Wubsy got a new pet and didn't follow the care instructions, giving his new pet candy, with crazy results. With each episode, there is a lesson that the kids can take with them. I was impressed, and would recommend it to a friend. Very cute.",1224115200,2,943,4.814814814814815

While I wouldn't consider this as scholarly educational as some other children's shows (Blues Clues for instance) it does still manage to not only keep you singing and dancing along but teaches valuable life lessons in a fun and upbeat way that has my little girl glued to every word.

Wubbzy isn't her all time favorite as sometimes it's a bit much for her (she prefers quieter shows such as Little Bear & Clifford) but the show is definitely in her top 5 and always brings a smile to my face as well.

Also the packaging on this disk is great, a 3D style front which ended up glued to a magnet and on our fridge was a nice bonus.",1224028800,2,891,4.229411764705882

3422588,4,B001947Q4E,"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy is an animated preschool show on Nick Jr.  This DVD contains several episodes from the first season, which include Wubbzy's best pals, Widget and Walden.  Although my three children are a bit too old for this kind of program, my wife runs a daycare business out of our home and is always looking for something to keep the youngest children entertained.  When playing this DVD for the first time, all of the daycare children were immediately immersed in the wild, wacky world of Wubbzy.  The music had them rocking in place, and one little girl actually stood up and started twirling and dancing around the room.  My wife was extremely pleased with how ""locked in"" the kids were to the show, and she immediately sat down to enjoy the brief period of relaxation this video allowed from her normally hectic afternoon.

One has to wonder what a Wubbzy is.  He lives in a tree and he has a bendy tail (and he likes it that way!), but that is about all the description I can gather about this character.  Some of the kids think he is a cat, while others think he is a bear.  One little boy even thinks he is a sponge, like Sponge Bob Square Pants, and another said he looks like cheese with a tail.  Heh-heh, I just love children's imaginations.  I don't believe the DVD ever explains exactly what a Wubbzy is.  Then again, I guess it doesn't really matter; especially to little kids.  =o)

This DVD contains 8 episodes, which is noted on the back cover as being 6 episodes with 2 bonus episodes.  The included episodes are as follows:

-  A Tale of Tails
- Special Delivery
- Widget's Wild Ride
- Attack of the 50-Foot Fleegle
- Come Spy with Me
- Wubbzy Tells a Whopper
- Mt. Fizzy Pop (Bonus Episode)
- Puddle Muddle (Bonus Episode)

Other bonus features include music videos, and some fun activities you can perform on your computer, such as a ring toss game and some printable coloring pages and party invitations.  When you launch the ""Click to Play"" HTML file on the DVD (from your computer), it basically takes you to a Nick Jr. website, where you and your children can participate in some interactive games and activities.  This is pretty standard fare for most small child targeted DVDs.  It is interesting enough to check out once or twice, but it loses its luster fairly quickly.

After playing this DVD a few times, over the past three weeks or so, my wife and I have found that it has lost the attention of the children.  They still like the music, but the shows themselves just don't hold their attention anymore.  One could assume that anyone would get sick of watching the same program more than once or twice, but this just isn't true with other DVDs, like Sponge Bob Square Pants, and Blue's Clues.  I think ""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! - A Tale of Tails"" is a very entertaining and somewhat educational DVD, but don't expect hours and hours of play time from it.  Kids will watch just about any cartoon adventure show once or twice, but Wubbzy just doesn't seem to have enough flair and excitement to warrant repeated viewing.  I would recommend having your children watch Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, on Nick Jr., to see if it grabs their attention before buying the DVD.  As the price of the DVD seems to remain fairly low, I do recommend it for parents and childcare providers, as a low cost form of entertainment for children under the age of 5 or 6.  It is cute, funny, and contains some really catchy tunes that get stuck in your mind and tend to drive you near insanity.  We will be putting our copy on the shelf for a few weeks or months, but will pull it out again once the kids have had a chance to miss it enough to want to sit and watch it again.

For those that wish to check out the bonus games and other activities included on this DVD (and much more), you can find them on the following Nick Jr. website:

3422589,4,B001947Q4E,"My young son loves this show, so was eager to share this with him. He enjoyed watching the collection of cartoons over and over again, but could not elaborate much about why he liked it. But it's a nice little show and it isn't as annoying or overly offensive as some of today's somewhat cynical kid's cartoons. The best thing about it is that we can let the kids watch this on DVD and not see the questionable clusters of ads and promos that Nick Jr. slips in with their preschool shows. We like many of their shows, but avoid watching broadcast version because we can't trust them to restrain from buckshot advertising.

Wow! Wow! Wubbzy looks to me to be created in what is known as ""flash animation,"" a computer-based process that moves shapes and characters digitally rather than with cel animation. It looks like late 50's/early 60 animation, much in the style of ""Tom Terrific,"" but with a more flowing feel and a kind of early video game style thrown in. Since one of the people behind the show is former Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert, it makes me wonder if, had HB stayed its own entity, if we would have seen Flintstones and Yogi cartoons done this way.

Grey Delisle, the voice of Wubbzy, is one of those highly skilled but rarely acknowledged voice artists that have more a role in our lives than we think. You've probably heard her and not realized it, since she does so many commercials and cartoons. My kids first heard her voice as toddlers when she was the voice of a little Teddy Bear in a Jump Start educational computer CD-ROM. She reminds me of Bernice Hansen, who was the specialist in child voices in the 1940's, particularly as Sniffles in various Warner cartoons.

My personal favorite part of the cartoons are the delightfully bubblegum pop tunes between the stories. You can also select a series of them to play as videos. I'd buy a CD of these songs in a heartbeat, since I'm an Archies fan from 'way back.",1224028800,2,1941,4.57183908045977
3422590,4,B001947Q4E,"My son had seen this show on NICK Jr. and was excited when he saw a DVD copy had arrived at our house.  I asked him what he remembered about it and he said he liked characters voices and thought the show was pretty funny.  After we watched a few episodes together, I can see the appeal.  Wow Wow Wubzy is a nice combination of humour and light moral lessons, the voice acting is above average and the animation pops out but is a little too clean in its edges and CG useage.  The 8 episodes on this DVD are a good representation of what the show offers, my son said he learned that you have to be very responsible to have a pet when we were done.  The extra music videos, ring toss game, and printable activities (coloring pages etc.)are welcome special features.  My son likes having this in his DVD collection and will share it with his sister when she is the right age.  Probably best for 3-6 year olds.",1224028800,,905,4.226744186046512

With day-glo colors and simple animation stylings, Wubbzy and his pals, Widget, Walden and others, will appeal primarily to kids in the pre-K to Kindergarten levels.  However, first and second graders might get a kick out of Wubbzy as well.

There are eight episodes (six original and two bonus) on this DVD.  Each episode puts Wubbzy and his friends in different situations that teaches children positive values such as taking responsibility for your actions and not telling lies.  My personal favorites are ""A Tale Of Tails"" and ""Come Spy With Me.""  There are music videos in each episode as well.  All are upbeat, positive and fun for little ones.

The DVD extras are excellent.  From printable coloring pages and invitations to a fun ring toss game (all accessible from your computer), this DVD goes above and beyond with it's educational and entertainment value.  There's even an option that allows you to just watch the music videos.

For non-stop fun for the kiddies and excellent values for the adults, ""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! A Tail of Tales"" has it all.  Highly recommended to families with young children and toddlers.",1223856000,2,1249,4.890476190476191
3422592,4,B001947Q4E,"It's nice to find a kids animated show that has short enough episodes to keep even a toddlers attention span, fun and inventive stories, often with a moral, and also some subliminal education. As a parent I often despair at what I consider stupid animation aimed more at young adults than children. Wubbzy has the mix about right, and with the pedigree of Nick Jr behind it, you know that your child won't be watching anything questionable. There are 6 episodes, plus 2 bonus ones for a combined run time of 92 mins, which is pretty good value. There are some interactive features too, some printable stuff for your pc, a music video and a game. For those kids learning French there is also a French language track. Overall 4 stars. My 4 year old loves it, whereas my 5 year old (soon to be six) probably needs something more involved.

3422593,5,B001947Q4E,"I've seen ""Wow Wow Wubbzy"" on Noggin and thought it was a pretty cute show, especially compared to some other shows that are featured on Noggin and Nick Jr. The world of ""Wow Wow Wubbzy"" is cute and colorful as are the characters. Also there's something about this show that kids love. Everytime that I put this DVD in for my 5 year old neice and 2 year old nephew to watch, they just sat and engrossed in it. It's like it hypnotised them or something. It made me laugh.

From an adult's point of view, I found ""Wow Wow Wubbzy"" to be entertaining and certainly tolerable to watch more than once. My neice's favorite episode on the DVD is ""Special Delivery"", while my personal favorite is ""Attack of the 50-Foot Fleegle"". One confusing part of the show for me, is that Wubbzy is being voiced by a woman (some will recognise the voice as that of Emily Elizabeth's in ""Clifford"") but Wubbzy is supposed to be male.

I definitely would recommend this DVD to anyone who has children in their lives. I think it's a great buy as well since it has 8 episodes on it plus a really fun game and printables.",1223337600,,1095,4.362745098039215
3422594,3,B001947Q4E,"Getting Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! A Tale of Tails was a bit of a gamble, but my 4-year old likes it so that is what counts.  It certainly appeals to its target demographic.  My 8-year old thinks it is okay, but it is by no means a favorite.

This disk has the first eight episodes of Nick Jr.'s Wubbzy and a few extras.  If there is a preschooler in your home, I don't see how you can go wrong with this $10 purchase.  It really appeals to the 3-7 demographic, with simple stories that have good message, simple yet flashy graphics, and a catchy theme song that will stick in your head for days (you are SO right Amanda).  The 3 main characters interact in a very basic manner and without other main characters to complicate things.  I suppose this appeals to the younger set and the voice acting is good.  The animation is almost comic book/vintage video game- like, very angular and 2D, yet it helps to create the disctinctive Wubbzy world.

All that said, my 4-year old daughter still likes SpongeBob better.  This indicates to me that a kid's show does not have to pander to a certain age group to be successful and well done.  Shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SpongeBob-SquarePants/dp/B0000C2IQB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thomas-Friends/dp/B001BEK856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thomas & Friends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chowder/dp/B001DSNFQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chowder</a>&nbsp;have a broader appeal across a larger age group and stand the test of time.  I can't see Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! doing that, but it is ""safe.""  I don't think anyone would object to having their little one watch this program.

If you want ""safe"" and ""formulaic"" for your children, and want them to watch programming with a positive social message, then you could do worse than this DVD.  Personally, I like a bit more of an edge, a bit more intelligence.  And so do my kids.

3.5 stars for ""kooky,"" wholesome (if somewhat bland) fun.",1223337600,,2122,5.6645569620253164
3422595,4,B001947Q4E,"As far as the show itself - it is very cute, pretty educational, and entertaining to the kids.  It is ""kooky"" enough to present traditional lessons in a non-conventional way, so kids can get the message with silly songs and kooky premises instead of preaching.

My reason for docking this a star is around actually owning the DVD.  My kids have gone back to Dora, Blue's Clues, Cars, Nemo, (recently) Spongebob, and others OVER and OVER.  I can't explain why some things click.  Wubbzy is on TV a lot and while they will watch it and like it, it hasn't reached ""repeat status"", so I'm not sure the DVD will get much use.

Then again, maybe this will ""click"" with your kid and you'll have positive messages being reinforced - which is a lot better than some of the other stuff out there.  And for $10, I guess there's not that much of a risk!  The game and printables on the DVD do add some value, so maybe I'll go to 4.5 stars!

The songs are funny and addictive - so be warned...",1223337600,,980,4.311475409836065
3422596,5,B001947Q4E,"I debuted this DVD for my two daughters, aged 2 and 4, yesterday and they've been singing about Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! ever since.  They'd seen this little guy on Nick Jr. so they already knew him but now they love him.

The DVD is nicely packaged with a couple of inserts and a really neat cover that as you move it makes Wubbzy's tail move.  The quality of the DVD sound is very good and the picture is terrific.  It upconverts to 720p very well and looks very close to hi-def.  The colors in the video are muted pastels and everything is shaped like a rounded box.  The drawing style is very reminiscient of Matt Groening's ""Life is Hell"" mixed with anime.  The characters are all very cute both in appearance and voice and very diverse (tall, short, wide, skinny, different colors, etc).  The music is good and original with lots of allusion towards disco here and there in various situations.  There's definitely plenty of nuance in here for the parents that goes unnoticed by the little ones that will give a chuckle.

The DVD has 8 shorts with Wubbzy going on various adventures where he and the kids learn a lesson or two without the lesson being shoved down their throats.  There's everything from diversity to patience to honesty taught to and by Wubbzy and his friends.  In between some of the shorts are cute little music videos with some really catchy music and lessons of their own.  It's nice to have a break from the cloying sweetness and over the top pandering from the likes of Dora, Barney, et. al.

Most important of all though: my kids loved Wubbzy and his friends.  I hope yours will too.",1222992000,,1605,4.505190311418685
3422597,4,B001947Q4E,"This review is not based on my opinion, but rather, on my children's. I am not a fan, (however, a reviewer double dared you not to sing the song...don't take the bet, she's right)....I honestly do not see the appeal of this show. My kids (5 and 3) on-the-other-hand LOVE it, and since this is the target audience, I rate this 4 stars. My reasons for not awarding it 5 stars are based on comparisons to other current shows they enjoy that have better lessons, and, more important for me is how quickly images are flashed on the screen. As you may or may not know, there are correlations between ADD and fast changing scenes. That is a major concern for me, and it seems many of the shows switch images faster just to keep a childs attention. These are not as bad as others, but not the best out there. If you are not familiar with this series you can easily preview it on television on Noggin or Nickjr.com (I highly recommend previewing it).

I am not going to repeat the descriptions that everyone else has stated. Suffice it to say your children will more than likely enjoy this DVD. I have found no problems playing it on my computer or DVD players.",1222992000,,1152,4.383177570093458
3422598,3,B001947Q4E,"First of all let me say that my son is 3.5 years old so this review is based on watching his response to the Wubbzy DVD.  He had never seen Wubbzy prior to seeing the DVD.  While he enjoyed watching the DVD in its entirety, he was not laughing out loud (like he does while watching cartoons like Curious George or Sitting Ducks).  Wubbzy also does not offer much educational value compared to cartons like Caillou or Super Why (on PBS).

*** Positive Points Include: ***

- Fun and manages to capture kid's attention
- Has bonus DVD features such as extra episodes, a music video, and a game.

*** Negative Points Include: ***

- Not educational or particularly funny
- Not something that parents can really watch with kids (like the old Bug's Bunny or Tom and Jerry cartoons).
- The characters sometimes use created words like ""flutter fly"" which, at least in my opinion, can confuse young kids about proper words and terminology.

If your kids are Wubbzy fans already then they will not be dissapointed with this DVD.  That being said, the Wubbzy cartoon is not particularly educational or engaging.  The main theme seems to be that it is ok to be ""cookey"" and different but that wears off pretty quickly.  It is fun and my Son does enjoy watching it, but not with the same excitement that he watches some other cartoons.",1222992000,,1323,4.563559322033898
3422599,4,B001947Q4E,"In fairness, I offer the following so people know where I am coming from when it comes to childrens programming; hopefully this will help you to know whether my opinion matters to you, or if you're just reading the rant of another Amazon nutjob.  :-)

I am NOT one of those parents that sees childrens programming & thinks it is great just because my girls can learn while watching. I am glad that my daughters learn in an entertaining way, enjoying education is of exceptional value, but a lot of the ""educational"" shows now offered tend to annoy me to no end; granted, I am an adult (more in age than in action, my wife might assert), but I don't like teaching that offers information in a patronizing manner.  Many times, tutelage is discreetly presented with a dumbing-down of the information being introduced, reflecting condescension rather than providing the impetus needed to stretch young minds, far more intelligent and acute than we ever realize.

That being said, this show is, in my humble opinion, one that is less annoying; it's not offering a blatant lower-the-bar type of instruction than many other kids shows seem to peddle.
  Important in you decision? Perhaps not; I am a little out there in my teaching methods with my girls. I allow fun shows with no ""educational"" value (at least according to the US Dept of Education) and use even those to help them see examples of good/bad, right/wrong, true/untrue, because it is good that kids can learn when they have their TV time and they shouldn't have to be bored when they earn that special treat; and I can't abide a show that teaches with a method that comes across ridiculously rudimentary. Give the kids some credit.  Many would excel, given the opportunity.

This show presents excellent social & personal messages for youngsters growing up in this crazy time; self-confidence (understanding that all are different & differences make us special), good manners (when did please & thank you get dropped from daily conversation), honesty, dealing with problems with a positive attitude, curiosity or interest in the unknown, a willingness to learn or try something new, patience, respect for others, & the power of trust & friendship, to name a few.

It is done in an entertaining way, with fun characters, easily understood explanations of personal values, & with an overriding theme that team-work reaches a goal and is better than facing troubles alone.

There are other more ""educational"" programs for sure, but this is one of the few that fully entertains, silly & fun, as it teaches, without being downright annoying to the parents that watch with their kids (and I don't mean that selfishly, when one watches children's programming, it is nice to have things mixed-up occasionally).
  Disney does this with their movies, providing adult oriented humor in a child's movie.  It is an excellent way to win parent & child instead of relying simply on the child's opinion.  Go after the people with the money.

At any rate, I thought about a 5, this is a very viable tool for a young person's growing intellect which is being assaulted from all sides.  In the end, I decided to offer a rating between 4 & 5.

Enjoy!!!",1222905600,2,3189,4.832720588235294
3422600,5,B001947Q4E,"My daughter is four years old, and it is sometimes difficult to find things that she likes to watch, and I can tolerate.  I find that shows that are shorter tend to be better, because they have more content.  Consider, for example, the difference between a standard episode of Dora the Explorer compared with a movie version of the same show.  The episodes have a lot more content, and the movies have lots of slow, boring filler.

That's why shows like this one, which are about ten minutes each, are a good choice.  It is short enough to watch at least one complete episode, even with a short attention span, and doesn't drag on like a 30 minute show would.

The show itself has lots of fun, active animation in bright, clear colors.  On DVD, the little guy (whatever he is -- my daughter thinks he is a yellow squirrel!) pops right off the screen.  The sound is clear, and the music entertaining, though simple.

The collection of episodes seems like a good variety, and together they add up to about 90 minutes.  So, while it is movie length, there isn't that feeling that you need to sit for 90 minutes and watch the entire thing in one sitting.  Which is a very good thing for the adults in the room.  For the length, the price is right, too.

Recommended (if you have a little one to enjoy it with).

  My two children ages 2 and 5 love Wubbzy because he is a fun character. What I love about Wubbzy is how each of the stories have a moral tale or lesson to them. The animation is reminiscent of the old days of video games and is bright and inviting.

Wubbzy is the ultimate optimist. Always curious and willing to listen to advice when the time is right, makes for a wonderful role model.

  This collection of shows on a single DVD is actually the same as shows you can see on TV. However, there are 2 episodes that currently are not on TV. These are Mt Fizzy Pop and Puddle Muddle.

Wubbzy! Wubbzy! Wow! Wow!""

I dare you to listen to the Wubbzy theme song and not sing along.
No, I DOUBLE dare ya!!

Although this loveable cartoon is for a much younger age group (preschool), older kids will also get a kick out the funny characters and Pac-Man style simple animation.

The main character is a squarish yellow creature with a long tail that can bend into any shape, including a spring, which he uses from time to time for rapid locomotion.  His friends are an overly-enthusiastic female rabbit inventor named Widget, and a bespectacled and very intelligent purple creature named Walden.  Each has a catch phrase of their own, which kids will soon be repeating ad nauseam.

This DVD contains 8 episodes from Season One, and is the first DVD released from the series.

A Tale of Tails
Special Delivery
Widget's Wild Ride
Attack Of The 50-foot Fleegle
Come Spy with Me
Wubbzy Tells a Whopper
Mt. Fizzy Pop
Puddle Muddle

Each episode has a positive message for kids, such as being comfortable with who you are; not touching things that don't belong to you; telling the truth; the importance of reading instructions; the joys of having friends, and much more.

It may drive parents crazy, but kids will love it.  So the next time your child utters the phrase ""That's koooky"", rest assured that he/she heard it on this show, and not from your psychiatrist or mother-in-law.

""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!
Wubbzy! Wubbzy! Wow! Wow!""

Darn!  Now I'll be singing it for days

Warning: Addictive.  Do not watch while driving or operating heavy machinery

Caution: There are already over sixty episodes, so be prepared for multiple DVD purchases.

Helpful hint: Christmas is coming.  Recommended for any preschoolers on your list.
