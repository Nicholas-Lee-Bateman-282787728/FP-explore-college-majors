8519340,3,B007L77M3I,"I have the older version of this collection from 2009 and most of the films are watchable, but are bad quality. To note, these are great movies. The quality of these movies aren't like they were filmed from a TV, but probably from the original film's negative, but weren't remastered.

Movies included are:
God's Gun  (Jack Palance & Lee Van Cleef)
The Hanged Man  (Steve Forest)
One-Eyed Jacks  (Marlon Brando & Karl Malden)
Paradise Canyon  (John Wayne)
Under California Stars  (Roy Rogers)
Angel and the Badman  (John Wayne)
Vengeance Valley  (Burt Lancaster)
The Old Coral  (Gene Autry)
The Proud and the Damned (Chuck Connors)
Twice a Judas  (Klaus Kinski)",1333670400,,661,4.981651376146789
