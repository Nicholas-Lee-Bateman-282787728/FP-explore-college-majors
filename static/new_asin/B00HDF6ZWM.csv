6154896,4,B00HDF6ZWM,"Doc McStuffins is one of those children's shows with such a clear-cut, logical premise that it makes one wonder why no one thought of it years ago. Kids love to play with their toys, kids love to pretend to take care of them, kids love to act like authority figures, yet they want to be reassured about fears, social issues, the unknown, facing pain and so on.

This series deals with so many of these things with such seamless skill, only a few of the messages seem less than subtle. Charm and warmth don't seem synthetic -- Doc has a loving, supportive family and wants to be a doctor like her mother. It's as if Marcella of the Raggedy Ann books was more of a mover and shaker, but in a nice way.

(Trivia note for Brady Bunch fans: the voice of Stuffy is Robbie Rist, who played the infamous, shark-jumping Cousin Oliver.)

8631626,5,B00HDF6ZWM,"I bought this for my granddaughter when she was barely 3. She had specifically asked for it for Christmas. It comes with a stretcher, several doctor items including a stethoscope, a syringe for giving shots, thermometer, etc. She especially likes the syringe because she gets to give ""pinches."" She has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and has to take shots of Enbrel weekly at home and have blood drawn every 3 months. The nurse always says ""big pinch"" before poking hence the little one gives pinches. Not the happiest moments for a 3 year old. She is now almost 6 years old. She still plays with it. She recently told me it was so little now that she was older. It is well constructed, nothing has broken, and she is still happy with it. I would buy it again, and I would recommend it to anyone with a toddler on up. I don't think any of the pieces are choking hazards.",1499817600,,869,4.471698113207547
