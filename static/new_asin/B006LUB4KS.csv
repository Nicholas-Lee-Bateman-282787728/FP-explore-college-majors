However, in my defense I think was overly excited about the Rurouni Kenshin live action movie coming out in August and somehow I thought that this Blu Ray would hold me over until then-BUT NO! This was a 45 some odd minute nightmare, and I do realize that this is separate from the original series and it should stand on its own merit- but when its so bad that you have no merit to stand on, that's a problem. Yes, this film is visually stunning-the animation is beautiful especially on Blu Ray, but that does not make up for it. It's way too fast paced, characters are MIA, and I know I'm not the only one traumatized by seeing Shishio's ""Crispy"" behind in bed with Yumi-I think I was done after that. I am upset, I am Rurouni Kenshin:""Reflections"" upset.

Bottom Line: I do not Recommend.",1341446400,4,900,4.454545454545454
