4708958,5,B005IF7AZK,"I watched this with my kids, who range in ages from 2-10 and we all enjoyed it very much! Its like a turtle version of Disneys finding Nemo! with a little bit of a twist that makes it relateable for older kids but still relateable for the younger ones too, it was PERFECT in my opinion. It shows sammy the turtle from hatching out of his egg and the obsticles he has to over come to get from his egg to the water, and all the other ocean creatures he comes in contact with while trying to find his mate, shelly who he has loved sinced he was a hatchling. Well my family and I all highly recommend this movie and hope that you enjoy sammys adventure as much as we did.",1326585600,3,667,4.0606060606060606
4708959,5,B005IF7AZK,My kids love these movies. We first watched it on Netflix and then I found the second movie at Value Village. They are simple movies but enjoyable enough for me to watch with them sometimes. The movie explores what happens when garbage is in the ocean as well as other topics that are important to teach little ones.,1509494400,,316,4.4655172413793105

It tackles some good environmental issues in a subtitle way, which is good and may stick with kids as they grow up. It's just a nice, fun adventure movie for kids.

Relationships and environmental care. The oil spill was something we were able to talk about and research further. He learned a lot about recycling and how to keep our environment clean so that the next generation can enjoy the beauty our earth has to offer. We talk about friendships and even though people leave you stay friends and can reunite. This isn't one of those annoying kids movie either I enjoy watching it with my kids and talking to them about different parts of the movie.  The music in it is great too I really enjoy all the songs and we sing them regularly. If you are thinking of purchasing this movie for you and your family you should do it.

4709049,5,B005IF7AZK,"My kids LOVE this movie and frankly it's done well enough that I actually don't mind repetitive viewings.

There are people saying this is a no go of a film for sensitive kids. My 5 yo is VERY sensitive, but all we needed to do was pause the movie and talk about it a little and then it was fine. There is peril in the ocean for many critters and I think this movie handles it well for the younger set. We opted for this over Nemo because I knew my kids would have nightmares about the big grinning shark (sharks in Turtle Tale were a little scary but not as bad as Nemo or Reef).

To the people saying that this film is trying to indoctrinate kids about evil humans and Green Peace...remember that this movie is told in flashback from the viewpoint of a 50 year old turtle. He isn't throwing propaganda, he's simply remembering the details of his experience through the decades when many of us humans used to think nothing of dumping all manner of stuff in the ocean and other groups of us were fairly militant about protecting our natural resources. It's Sammy turtle's life experience and history through his eyes. And it's not a bad thing to show our kids the mistakes we've made with our planet and help them see te benefit of trying to keep it clean.",1441324800,3,1256,4.340425531914893

4709080,1,B005IF7AZK,"They manage to write in nearly every environmental issue possible into this children's movie.  Oil spills, destructive trawling, plastic dumping, deforestation, whaling, etc.  I threw it away after watching it one time with my 3 year old.  This is ridiculous.  The one singular plot to this story is little Sammy looking for his mate.  That's it.  The rest of the ""story"" is about how mankind is ""killing"" mother nature.  All except for the hippies and the green peace folks who are the only ""decent"" humans in the movie.  The turtle even rides out most of the movie with a peace symbol on his back.  All I need is some basic entertainment for my child.  I am perfectly capable of teaching my own child how to respect mother nature and don't need or appreciate what could be best described first as a propaganda film, second as a child's movie.",1433635200,5,844,4.641891891891892

She's 2.5, so anything that can hold her attention for more than 27 seconds is worth 5 stars in my book.  I bet we've seen this movie 157 times in the last month alone LOL. It's a super cute story about a little turtle's journey through ocean life, there's no vulgar ""hidden adult humor"" that I need to worry about negativity influencing my toddler, and it's interesting enough that I enjoy watching it with her and am not bored to tears.  We originally started watching it on Netflix Instant Streaming but I decided to search for it on Amazon so we'd have a DVD copy in case Netflix suddenly stops streaming it. I'm not surprised to see that it has such great reviews on Amazon.",1428710400,,750,4.427536231884058

4709158,3,B005IF7AZK,"Anyone with sensitive young children, this is a major no-go.  I saw the long list of positive reviews saying this was a great movie for very young children, so I rented it to watch with my 3 and 5 year olds.  The opening scene with the sea gull had both of them in instant tears.  By the time it got  to the descending view of whirling sharks two scenes later my 5-year-old was screaming and I had to shut the movie off.  From start to finish, it is almost non-step peril.  One scare after another, and way too much for any sensitive, easily frightened young child to handle.  Never mind that the pivotal scene at the end of the movie is when Sammy goes to find Shelly in a veritable love boat with turtle couples canoodling around every corner.  The danger and the subject matter are a wee bit over the heads of the age group everyone seems to think this is appropriate for.  As an adult I found it entertaining, and older grade school children would too, but I found it way inappropriate for my two under 5.",1411603200,12,1009,4.296296296296297

In the very first scene a an older giant turtle is lumbering across the road close into the beach and almost gets run over. This alone was enough to send my son into orbit, nevermind the ensuing five minutes of torment when the emerging babies hatch from their eggs and find themselves wrestling out of the beak of a seagull.

The 3D in this movie is really some of the best that I have ever seen. It's almost too good. I turned it on out of curiosity to watch a few minutes and ended up watching the entire film with my girlfriend.

The movie itself is ok.. Maybe a 2/5 star movie that seems like it was directed by the entire PETA organization. The movie is rife with eco friendly messages, and lessons on being accountable for what the human race does to the planet. It's not bad, but it's definitely a focus of the film.

If you want an amazing 3D movie to showcase then you can stream this through 3D enabled devices (I did it through my LG 60PH6700 TV) and I'd highly recommend giving it a shot. With that said, I wouldn't pay to see or own this movie.

While I can only suppose the reason this genre is so popular stems from the fact that we live in a world that's 75% water and, well, there's plenty of fish in the sea.

Bad puns aside, A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures (also known as Sammy's Adventures: The Secret Passage) is a 2010 Belgian animated film produced in English.  It comes in at a runtime of 88-minutes and is unrated though really there's nothing here that would prevent it from getting the G-rating that Finding Nemo enjoys.

You'll note I mentioned that it was produced in English- this is important because films originally recorded in a foreign language that come across the pond only to get slapped with an English dub track are more often than not exercises in disaster with mismatched mouth flaps, painfully stiff conversation flow and absolutely no comedic timing.  Take comfort in knowing Studio Canal avoids any such snafus here.

The story here centers on the exploits of a sea turtle (Sammy) who embarks upon a journey that will take him around the world and back to the beach where he was born.  The film opens with narration by William Hurt as old turtle-Sammy on the very beach he was hatched several decades earlier.  While crowded and populated now, his flashback to his own hatching reveals a much more clean and serene beach and thus sets off both a theme of things to come and a journey which could well have been called ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" had Lemony Snickett not beaten these guys to the punch.

Make no mistake, the backstory of a single turtle's journey from hatching to finding a mate to returning to the beach of hatching to see his grandkids off to a life at sea is certainly decent but prepare for a near constant succession of setbacks and crises, most of which are a direct result of humanity's influence over nature.

Before sliding below the waves, Sammy makes a lifetime friendship with Leatherback Ray (Anthony Anderson).  From there it's our first taste of humanity's negative touch in the form of an oil spill.  Netting, illegal whaling, pollution, the film quickly runs the gamut of negativity but all hope isn't lost once Sammy encounters the hippie Snow (Melanie Griffith), her cat, Fluffy (Tim Curry), and slightly older female green turtle Vera (Kathy Griffin).

While the script is never razor-sharp or overly clever, it's passable enough for adults, who will likely find enjoyment in watching the slow changes of society throughout the span of the film (Sammy is supposed to have been born in 1959).  Kids however will likely delight in the clean, colorful visuals and fleshed out characters to be offended by the oft heavy handed themes of environmentalism present here.

In all, A Turtle's Tale certainly succeeds in providing an hour & a half of family-friendly entertainment (be forewarned the domestic release contains nothing in the way of special features- not even a commercial in the beginning).  The lack of cleverness will certainly keep it from infringing upon Pixar's territory but solid visuals and a bit educational value should hold the interest of the younger ones.  The soundtrack is also noteworthy for its attempt to chronicle the given eras of the film with contemporary musical entries.

It may be true that A Turtle's Tale fails to tread on Pixar or DreamWorks' supremacy of the medium, it should also be noted that it was considered successful enough to warrant a sequel.  A Turtle's Tale 2: Sammy's Escape from Paradise comes to DVD and Blu this July.",1366761600,,3914,4.8149253731343284

First of all, it was good quality - animation, characters, plot, etc.  Secondly, they didn't portray humans as evil, destructive, anti-nature monsters.  Even the oil, lumber, and fishing companies weren't made villainous.  They did show some negative effects of irresponsible human intervention or accidents, but they also showed the great good of the human race at the same time.  We felt that the percentage of destruction was actually an honest representation of reality.  I've never seen an environmental movie done so fairly.  The only eye-roll was the idea that globs of oil would sink in the water and settle on the plants and animals below.  Maybe I'm missing something, but oil floats!  In addition, although there were many tense, ""scary"" scenes, I feel that even those were done gently enough.  No dramatic death-of-beloved-character scenes, which I'm aware shows the smaller percentage of incidents, thus maybe a skewing of reality, but for my sensitive 4-year-old, their gentleness was GREATLY appreciated, portraying the dangers of sea-life while not sending her into sobs and nightmares.

4709324,2,B005IF7AZK,"A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures is, well, a cute film.  Sammy hatches out of his egg and has a difficult time getting to the ocean.  Once there, he doesn't seem to like the water very much, preferring to ride on some flotsam.  He makes a friend, Ray, and they both float around, with Sammy eating plants and Ray eating jellyfish (he's a leatherback, but this is never mentioned).  Continuing adventures center around sharks, oil spills, trawl nets, pollution, environmentalists, whaling, friendship, and romance.

You never really get to understand that sea turtles are air breathers (that's why they drown when caught in nets), that they'll eat plastic or tar balls, that even large sea turtles can be found missing flippers due to sharks, that sea turtles don't mate for life, and that they don't visit both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and they certainly cannot survive anywhere close to Antarctica.  And papa turtle NEVER watches over the hatchlings.  Mama doesn't either.  Of course, when sea turtles can talk to whales and cats and seabirds, but not people, you should recognize that it is a fantasy.

On the positive side, the reefs are fantastic. Beautiful.  So if you want a cutesy tale for the young ones, okay.  But if you want something with a bit more pizzaz, I'd suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turtle-The-Incredible-Journey/dp/B005CRDG8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turtle: The Incredible Journey</a>&nbsp;for a turtle film, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00005JM02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>&nbsp;for a really cute film with undersea adventures (and adventures in a dental office!).",1338940800,,1737,6.048979591836734
4709325,5,B005IF7AZK,This movie is great for the whole family. Probably not as good as Finding Nemo but still none the less a great movie. I would recommend this movie as it has great characters and a good story.,1338854400,,191,4.1891891891891895
4709326,4,B005IF7AZK,"This was a pleasant surprise, as I had not heard much about it, and my three kids ages 5 - 7 1/2 really liked it. It centers on a young turtle's adventures in the ocean, from the moment he emerges from his egg tiny and scared, to his return to the same beach many years later as an adult. He finds and loses (and finds again) love, friendship, and adventure. There are some environmental messages thrown in, when he encounters damaging pollution, but it never gets too preachy, and he encounters helpful, caring humans too. The animation and writing are cute, although not on the same level as the megahits Pixar and Dreamworks put out. It's also safe for young kids - nothing overly scary or inappropriate, although it doesn't skew too young - my almost 8-year old going on 15 liked it too.",1337558400,7,791,4.5
4709327,5,B005IF7AZK,Your Kids will love this  charming tale Of friendship and Love. Get it Share it enjoyed it your self or get 2 or 3 for gifts.  Hours of fun they will want to see it again & again,1337212800,,178,3.6578947368421053
4709328,5,B005IF7AZK,"This movie has a very lovely story. As a turtle goes on a journey to find his mate. Along the way, he meets some special friends and humans too. It doesn't teach kids to be hippie and love green, as one person commented here. But anyway, at this point in our lives, we need to remind our children of the delicate state our planet is in. It's a tale about finding love and making friends along the way with great graphics and cool songs that I'm trying to find and download.",1336867200,,473,4.208791208791209
4709329,5,B005IF7AZK,"First of all, I saw a review saying that the makers were trying to con people into thinking this was a Nemo series... That is ridiculous. I knew it had nothing to do with Nemo, however its very adorable! I actually liked it better than Nemo. I highly recommend this movie, and cannot wait to see it again. My 16 month old daughter pointed at the tv the whole time the movie was on at all of the different sea creatures. The movie also discretely touches on conservation issues, which is a plus. All in all, definitely a really sweet movie!",1336262400,,539,4.346534653465347
4709330,1,B005IF7AZK,"Haven't watched the movie yet.
It's my fault, but, feeling scammed for multiple reasons. ...
1 - The art is done entirely to look like Nemo's turtles.  I thought it was a related story.  It's NOT.  It's by a French company called Vivendi.
2 - Not checking the packaging when I purchased this version for the Digital Copy.  It is not iTunes compatible, not even Apple compatible.  This version is Windows only, and you have to sign up for an account with Best Buy CinemaNow.  It's that specific.
It has been forever since I've seen a DVD that WAS NOT iTunes compatible.
3 - Last, on top of that, they instruct you to disable your firewall and pop-up blockers.  Not a safe move with all the hacking going on nowadays.  No thank you.
Call me cynical, but I think this company was looking for busy moms, who would do just what I did.  See a movie that looks like a Disney made for home DVD, get it home and have it opened before realizing it's not what they thought.
If I hadn't opened it I would return it, because I'm so unhappy with their marketing technique.  I hope my kids at least enjoy the movie.  Enjoy the cash, Vivendi.",1336003200,8,1126,4.339712918660287
4709331,5,B005IF7AZK,This movie doesn't get enough credit. So glad we gave it a chance. It's right there with disney/pixar or dream works. The graphics are beautiful and the music is wonderful as well. My 3 year old loves it. The cover of this movie just doesn't do it justice. I wish they'd make more animal movies like this and stay away from those weird animated movies.,1334275200,15,352,4.430769230769231
4709332,4,B005IF7AZK,"Yes, it has an environmental message (obligatory in children's films these days), but it's kept somewhat (somewhat, compared, for instance, with ""Happy Feet"") low key.  The animation is colorful and pleasant (saw the 2D version - passable adult diversion after viewing it multiple times: watch the 2D version and try to find the obvious ""3D moments""), the story very simple.  My grandson loves it and it makes him happy to watch it while he plays.  What else could be better?  And, and I hope I'm not alone in being pleased with this, while ""mate"" and ""mating"" are referred to, there is none of the obnoxious sexual innuendo that some studios seem to think belong in movies, even those for the very young (yeah, that was my real complaint with ""Happy Feet"").",1329004800,13,758,4.763358778625954
4709333,5,B005IF7AZK,"This is my 4 year old granddaughters favorite movie, and I confess I love watching it as well.  The artwork is lovely and soothing, the characters are endearing. The soundtrack is delightful.  Teaches compassion and friendship, and yes, to a previous reviewers dismay, actual environmental issues.  It does so in a basic way that even a child can understand, such as warning sea creatures to ""don't eat the plastic"" or seeing the effects of dumping garbage in the ocean (hardly controversial!)  Great movie for entire family.",1328832000,23,525,5.069767441860465
4709334,5,B005IF7AZK,This is the cutest little turtle movie I recommend it to all ages. My 3 year old asks to watch it over and over and I don't mind because I like it too.,1327536000,2,151,3.606060606060606
4709335,1,B005IF7AZK,"It seems to be intended for children but children don't need to watch this junk.  It is basically teaching children to be hippie environmentalist and to hate oil and love green. It has a bad view of marriage.  Basically they exaggerated everything.  All the bad things were done by humans who would hunt whales, throw trash in the ocean, and spill oil and the good done was all by environmentalists, literally hippies, and ""green "" people.  I am not against preserving the ocean and things and not for dumping trash in the ocean or for oil spills.  This movie has a huge green hippie liberal agenda.  A boat crashes in the movie and oil spills and the dialogue between the turtles teaches that oil is bad period,  and not that the boat was an accident.  Then the latter half of the movie they are hunting a whale and the environmentalists are trying to stop them and the boat is called the ""green warrior"".  There is also the civil rights fist throughout the movie and peace signs.  This is for everyones info.",1327190400,16,1010,4.530386740331492

The music is catchy and really good. I wish the soundtrack were available but I haven't been able to locate one. The tale of Sammy's journey is fun and interesting to watch and the environmental message is poignant and important for little ones to learn... that we all bear responsibility to care for our oceans and the creatures who dwell in them. Excellent lesson and a great way to teach it.",1326672000,3,556,4.626262626262626
4709337,5,B005IF7AZK,"The story follows an actual sea turtle's life.  Of course there are liberties taken, such as the turtle's best friend and love interest.  But overall the story is based on true life events of a tracked sea turtle.  There are some big names in this movie including: Melanie Griffith, Kathy Griffin, and Tim Curry.  (I heart Tim Curry, by the way.)  Our main character, Sammy, goes through a lot in the fifty years from when he was born, including dealing with both man made and natural obstacles- but through it all he keeps his head up and his thoughts on his lady turtle friend from birth, Shelly.  There are strong tones of environmentalism in  this film, so be ready for some questions in regard to this.",1326585600,17,707,4.563492063492063
