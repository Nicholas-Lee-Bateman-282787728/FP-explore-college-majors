8618002,5,B00FQLK2II,"John Pilger, journalist and documentary maker, Australian, is loved and reviled in equal measure in his country of origin. This 2013 documentary will go some of the way to explain why. Utopia is a township, a place where little has changed in the thirty years of supposed acknowledgement of indigenous rights and Government reconciliation of these to improve the lot of its indigenous people. In fact the John Howard so called intervention policies has worsened the life of many in remote communities such as Utopia. In Utopia there is little of what most settlements take for granted, running water, sewage systems, public transport, a range of shops and services like supermarkets and banks. What there are is depressingly familiar. Run down housing stock, parasites living of poverty (like those charging exorbitant prices for basics). There is the imposition of rules on a different culture without understanding the consequences of doing so. It is a weep with shame to be Australian documentary. Although there have been those in the media decrying Johh Pilger and this film, they have not backed up their criticism of what he has presented with substantive fact. That is for the indigenous people of Australia, through a succession of Governments both left and right, little has changed and is unlikely to change soon. The pessimism of this is partly diluted by the resilience of the indigenous people interviewed and who still see there is hope for justice.",1451606400,,1464,5.104166666666667

The movie depicts the historical and ongoing discrimination against the original peoples of Australia. Pilger exposes the rampant racism prevalent in Australian culture. I highly recommend this movie.",1435536000,,359,5.0
8618004,5,B00FQLK2II,"This is a ""Must See"" documentary, if you can get it in the NTSC format.  I have had to reorder three times, and still only received a PAL copy, which did not play on my DVD player (but it played on my computer).  As a documentary, the name John Pilger should suffice to identify its quality and impact.  It shows a face of Australia not normally seen in MSM, something that was long in coming.",1425513600,,393,4.213333333333333
8618005,5,B00FQLK2II,"Australia has always had a sunny image and a positive,extrovert quality of benevolence,however something has been missing in its presentation of itself in its history and even politics. It has sent forth its sons and daughters to England and USA like Clive James,Germaine Greer,Robert Hughes and John Pilger. Pilger has been a polemical journalist and documenter of great conviction. Like Greer he has denounced Australia's treatment of its indigenous countrymen,sweeping its problems under the carpet to promote a 'city of white'(Canberra),built on colonial attitudes. There was no mention of Aborigines,the first Australians. Pilger has been here before 28 years before, seeing no changes,and even in 1966 in Jay Creek when he covered the `stolen generation' linked to fascist eugenics, 'breeding out the black',many to become domestic servants in middleclass homes,a form of slavery.

Pilger's tone is one of controlled anger,yet he tries to argue the case with calm reasonableness. He makes a searing indictment of the `apartheid' and `genocide' the early colonial settlers and future generations came to practice,the utopian fantasy of white Australia and the dystopia on which it is built. He visits Botany Bay,once home to the Aborigines,now a hotel that charges $30,000 a week to stay there. He visits spa hotels that once served as concentration camps, pausing en route to harangue sheepish-looking politicians and asking random revellers if they understand why their predecessors don't celebrate Australia Day. They blame the Aborigines for the conditions they live in as if they want to live like that,their drunkenness,their self-neglect. They are denied basic rights,classed as uncivilized,their humanity denigrated (cf.'the history wars'of the 1990s).The underlying problems are their need for good housing, education, healthcare,and employment..They are denied the basic facilities white Australians take for granted. Some live in asbestos-riddled houses,tin shacks.

White Australia has emerged as one of the richest nations on the planet thanks to its mineral resources, the indigenous people are worse off than many of those living in developing countries. The incidence of trachoma among indigenous Australians is among the highest in the world. A landgrab of Northern Australian land was practised on the pretext of accusations of paedophile rings in Mutitjulu(all unproven by reports saying there's no evidence). The 2007 ""intervention"" in the Northern Territory organised by the John Howard government was a bizarre act of taxpayer-funded official hysteria. This led to federal takeover and army occupation to `save children'.This was backed up by government chicanery,the `Lateline'TV propaganda,cover-ups,lies, stopping the benefits of those who refused,denied basic amenities,demonised,and native title legislation was ignored. All Aborigines were blackened as molesters. A lot of the children removed to residential schools were sexually abused by whites. Some of the richest mining land has been situated under Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal territories.

The film concentrates on Aboriginal communities: Utopia,in central Australia;Ampilatwatja in the Northern Territory;and the Mutitjulu community at the eastern end of Uluru(Ayers Rock).Utopia is the home of the 1st Australians,a very poor ,dry, dusty,most disadvantaged place. In Ampilatwatja,there is no basic sanitation,shelter or transport. There is chronic diabetes,coronary disease and trachoma. The children suffer deafness due to dehydration and cockroaches. These are inhuman 3rd world conditions in one of the world's richest countries. 50,000 Aborigines need more help from the government. Most Aborigines die by age 45. The mining industry has campaigned against taxes on their profits. Their taxes have been reduced to near nothing,losing $60million, enough to reduce the terrible lack of rights and poverty of the Aborigines. Whenever Aborigines' expectations have been raised,that trust has been betrayed by treachery. In west Australia x8 more Aborigines have been imprisoned than blacks in apartheid South Africa. A 14th prison was built in a policy of `packing and stacking'We see videos of Aboriginals in custody who ended up dead. Pilger interviews Arthur and Leila Murray(now deceased)who campaigned for son Eddy for 30 years,who was killed in custody. Pilger tells it like it is,presenting shocking facts,and images of incarceration, disease,malnutrition and neglect. Racism persists beneath Australian society,despite apologies given in 2008 by PM Rudd,and now given doublespeak under questioning.

There is a basic difference between white Judeo-Christian belief systems of `progress' ,where ideas of 'heaven' mean you can do to the land what you like, plunder, pillage,rape,destroy;and indigenous beliefs focused on, for example, the ceremonial activities deemed to be essential for the maintenance of the world precisely as it was at the moment of creation. Instead, we are all currently contemplating the consequences of climate change and industrial processes that threaten the life supports of this planet. The traditional societies of the aboriginal people's has been destroyed violently by europeans who do see or understand that indigenous people's remind us all of different ways of orientating human beings in social, spiritual and ecological space. The path we have taken is not the only path. The Aboriginals remind us that we must all change the way we inhabit this planet. It is this unpalatable truth that has caused so much antipathy towards a people who's country, way of life and way of thinking has been stolen from them! Pilger does a sterling job to present the unbroken history of Aboriginal presence and resistance as well as state maltreatment,from imprisonment through the Stolen Generations to the current situation. Pilger usefully employs Aboriginal speakers like Randall,Nold,Tjanara Goreng Goreng,Patricia Morton-Thomas,Arthur Murray,Rosalie Kunoth-Monks and journalist Amy McQuire,determined to bring justice back to their land.",1406246400,5,6071,5.825646794150731
