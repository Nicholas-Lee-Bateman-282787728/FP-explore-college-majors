683865,5,6303574289,"How could I not give this release 5 stars?!  TNG had great acting, special effects (for its time ;) and storylines.  Over its seven year run, it became more than the sum of its parts.  It wasn't just about phasers, warp-drives and bumpy foreheads, it was about telling a great story.  Sure, there were the mandatory shoot 'em up episodes, but who wasn't moved by 'The Inner Light', or was left in a contemplative state well after 'Measure Of A Man', or just plain laughed out loud during 'Q-Pid'?  But enough of my ranting.  The First Season wasn't terribly great, but it's a more than worth beginning.
Though one thing I'd like to see on the upcoming season releases, is commentary tracks.  I would love to hear Frakes on the episodes he directed, ditto for Stewart and Burton.  Also, it'll be nice to have some outtakes, c'mon we all there are countless bootleg tapes in circulation of the stars flubbing their lines and such.
When all seven seasons are released, I may never leave the house.",1011225600,2,994,4.607954545454546

683867,5,6303574289,"Paramount seem to have listened, planned and are going about releasing quality DVD box sets with extras. One season is planned for release every 2 months
The great news is that the picture has been remastered and the sound remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. 4 new documentaries have been created for this release lasting for an hour. Presentationally the box sets form a neat library of 7 packs when placed alongside each other. A booklet is also included per box.
Season 1 of The Next Generation has only a few outstanding stories. The rest (looking like they are from the eighties) tend to spend too much time on supporting characters such as Wesley Crusher. Fortunately Patrick Stewart does such a superb job of leading the cast, the weaker stories can be forgiven for the most part.
An excellent release with the entire 7 seasons on the way. Fingers crossed for Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise releases soon!",1011139200,24,923,4.811320754716981
683868,5,6303574289,"""The Best Of Both Worlds"" is the true inspiration of the Borg.  Never-ending and teriffic action, the special effects (which you'll mostly see on part 2) and the plot gets you off your seat!  You truly can't miss this one!",1003363200,2,222,4.525
683869,5,6303574289,"Unfortunately I only became a Next Generation fan around the time the series was about to go off of the air.  So I can't even imagine the suspense that the truly faithful had when this episode aired with a whole summer remaining before the answer would be revealed.  I was edgy just to see the next episode even though I only had to wait a day.
What I can say is that this episode is one of the best written and produced television events i've ever seen.  The sets, as always, were awesome.  The Borg ship is ominous and eerie.  The action and surprise is palpable.  And the plot is just outstanding.  I don't wanna give ANY of it away but just suffice it to say that an almost perfect quandry is presented to the crew of the Enterprise.
The Borg has to be the most ominous concept perhaps ever created for television.  Picture this... a big metal cube that flies through space without any apparent leader.  And wherever it goes it's sole purpose is to anihilate the planets and vessels it encounters.  Or it seeks to assimilate the inhabitants into its' 'collective'.  Once assimilated the beings lose all sense of self and become motivated only by the desire to serve the collective.  It's kinda like Night of the Living Dead in space.  You can't outrun em and if you kill em more just keep comin'.  Frightening.
I used to have many discussions about what the Borg was meant to represent.  I always believed that the Borg was meant to represent Communism but I was intrigued by the many different interpretations that I was exposed to.
In short, you don't have to be a Next Generation fan to appreciate this single episode.  It stands on its' own merit.  When you watch Next Generation in general it's hard to imagine how anyone ever even liked the original series with James T. Kirk.  This episode is just beyond fantastic.
Next Generation has to be one of my five favorite television series ever and this is the crown jewel of Next Generation.",989193600,4,1947,4.530085959885387
683870,5,6303574289,"Now how to explain the greatness of this episode without ruining the suspense for those who haven't seen it.  Let's say this much - the borg are  in it, which makes it good there.  Now if you've seen episodes of Voyager  or First Contact, these borg don't seem as rough looking or dangerous, but  it's the same guys.  This episode is filled with suspense and you'll love  the ending.  You'll want to see part 2 for sure and I'm not saying that  just because it's only natural to watch a part 2.",966556800,7,494,4.282608695652174

684102,3,6303574289,"I was feeling nostalgic and rewatched the first season, and was struck was how staggeringly-cheesy this first season really was. Considering I was much younger when I first watched so many of these I guess I missed this, but wow, they really had some work to do to find their stride with this series initially, as this series really gets a majorly goofy start.

""Encounter at Farpoint"" was amusing and a decent introduction of the characters, with the Dr. McCoy cameo being a favorite element of mine. But beyond that, it's a mixed bag with so many of these episodes. ""The Last Outpost"" felt truest to Trek spirit to me, at least in comparison to the original series. There's a new enemy, there's action, and there's the predictable omniscient being on the planet that just wanted to test the characters, etc. Goofy fun.

But then you get to episodes like ""Home Soil"" (the little blinking light in a jar) and the boredom is staggering. ""When the Bough Breaks"" was unintentionally creepy, and ""11001001"" shows how horrendously non-PC Commander Riker was (with his ""humorous"" remark about Georgi teaching Data how to paint: ""A blind man teaching an android"". Yeah, good one, Riker...)  Additionally, I never realized how obliquely sexually creepy the subplot with the holodeck character was in that episode. Must have missed it when younger, but watching it now and it's almost cringe-worthy listening to Picard and Riker talk about the hologram woman.

Some episodes are just plain goofy AND boring, such as ""Too Short a Season"" and ""We'll always Have Paris"", to the point that they almost feel like filler episodes.  One standout episode would be ""Conspiracy"" which, on a new watching, I'm amazed this made it to televisions, with a guy's neck throbbing grotesquely shortly before Picard blasts a phaser at his head, causing it to explode, eventually revealing an alien inhabiting his hollow body cavity. Man, how did that get past the ratings folks? Of course, when those alien bugs go crawling stop-motion style I was instantly thinking Pee Wee's Playhouse. Someone call Large Marge!

The final episode, ""The Neutral Zone"", would have been interesting without the cliche 80's characters showing up to ruin it, but at least they set the stage for future interaction with the Romulans. You know, the series has not aged well, and the cheesiness is strong with this first season, but it's still an enjoyable bit of nostalgia.",1485302400,,2424,4.958128078817734

I never knew how rude Picard could be!  I understand he has to make his authority known as the captain to a completely new crew, but holy cow, I certainly was not expecting such behavior from him in the beginning of the season!

This season is important to watch because many important characters and races that reappear in later seasons are introduced here.  If you have seen episodes from later seasons, you will immediately be able to tell how much they grow from Season 1.  If you haven't, then you are in for a treat!

I look forward to watching the remaining seasons in order to relive the wonder of Star Trek from my childhood, and to see any episodes in the middle I might have missed!",1481241600,,838,4.374193548387097

No two parts story's (outside of the pilot) producers were not that great. Actors where still feeling out the parts they were given. Second season was a bit better, Yar was gone, no more crying every time she was confronted with a problem. Denise Crosby was given a better role as her daughter in later seasons. Alas it took until the third season to get cooking. Later years brought ""A Fistful of Datas"" in 1992, plus more Q episodes. Ever show takes time to find its footing. Thank goodness it had time to become a 5 star show by season 7. Then they killed the show by producing crap movies. The last two sucked. They never used Q in any movie. Just think, taking the Q story from Voyager concerning the Q civil war and the Q who wanted to kill himself. Then make it into one movie.

Never same plot.. surprising on what happened.  Which he is hard to do for me. I usually drive people nuts when I do watch TV with them because most are so easy for me to see what is about to happen in the story line.
I would tell them in order to show them why I didn't like to watch the show much ..
Predictable it is not. Except for some challange will happen and how they deal with it which isn't predictable. It shows individual.  Family friends and society struggles .

685223,5,6303574289,"This era of television still contained morals, fables, and values that are all but lost to the depravity of the present.  We must ask ourselves what happened?  What was the turning point in our government where demoralization replaced family, humanity, and intellect?  I say government, because all things corporate and political utter from the same mouth.  There has been a deliberate hijacking of our thoughts.  Peace of mind has been replaced with an overwhelming sense of ""fight or flight"" compulsion.  This is the era of un-reality shows like Teen Mom, the Kardashians, Lil' Wayne, and others... This pit of despair us sensible people find ourselves in these days is a result of someone changing the programming quite literally.  It began gradual, but it's snowballing ever faster into oblivion.  Shows like Star Trek and Quantum Leap would never make it one season these days.  69 vaccines filled with everything from mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, and aborted fetus cells are pumped into our children, attacking their capacity for Empathy.  If  the shots don't kill them with SIDS, or childhood cancer, it leaves them catatonic, battling with some form of Autism, or cut off from their humanity.  The time of Reagan is sadly but a memory the regime has almost erased.  I support this show, commend it for it's substance, and although it wasn't without it's subconscious suggestions, it was far less barbaric than watching Real Housewives display the ugly side of human nature as vulgar as they do.",1473984000,,1506,5.09795918367347

685318,5,6303574289,"STNG had an amazing run full of good episodes. The first two seasons are a little ahhh stiff as the cast needed time to gel. If your new to STNG keep watching. Highlights from this season are Where No One Has Gone Before, Datalore, 11001001, Too Short A Season, Heart of Glory, The Arsenal of Freedom, The Neutral Zone and Conspiracy. Conspiracy for me, had one of the most WTH moments with special effects as a kid watching it. Q turns out to be a fun character but that two hour intro is rough to watch years later. The characters change quite a bit as they gain footing and the chemistry starts to happen. If your a first time fan and find it hard to get invested jump to season 2. Season 3 is where everything comes together and the characters really start taking on a life of their own. TOS was a good series but we got so few episodes to really layout the universe. STNG came along and laid down an amazing universe and gave us a ton of good episodes. DS9 did a good job moving the story forward and is easy to get into. Voyager as well so if you get hooked there is a TON of content in store for you. Enterprise never got to warp speed and so far it looks like the new show might end up the same way. Still STNG has 10 seasons and when you finish 10 have a go at season 1 again to see just how far the characters evolved.",1473033600,,1328,4.072519083969466

685354,3,6303574289,"I want to first say that this is one of my favorite shows. But the first season is my least favorite season. ""Skin of Evil"", ""The Arsenal of Freedom"", and a couple of other shows were my favorites. Unfortunately there was little to write home about after them. I was a child when this show originally aired and liked it then but compared to what came after I came to realize that the first couple of seasons were very pedestrian.

The newer casings are leaps and bounds ahead of  the original cases. Those first ones were big and bulky and the interior spindles would often break because they were hard plastic. the newer interiors appear to be better constructed and more durable. I also like that the episodes are on the interior of the DVD case listed in chronological order along with the Star Dates.

I'm the 2336th person to review this DVD set and I give it only a Three Star rating due to poor lighting, bad set construction and even some poor set direction. In one episode I noticed a light in the corner of the turbo lift. In another I noticed some small trash on the carpet! the stories were pretty pedestrian as well.

All in all this was a good start but the best was yet to come. I recommend this for the backstory needed to understand the show.

685412,3,6303574289,"Look, I love TNG.  It is my Trek of choice.  I can say as a bright, angry teenager it helped shape me into a useful adult and showed me the path to my geeky people.  I will even admit I got here because I saw a 3rd season episode with Tasha Yar and knew I had to follow this story with this character knowing full well she was going to die horribly walking in the door.

And as much as I love the fact that this is an amazing cast and this shows the beginning of a truly life-altering story - this season sucks.  There is no way ""Code of Honor"" or ""Skin of Evil"" are insulting to the watcher's intelligence should not be watched without being plied with alcohol (though the funeral is solid work. on the later).  The former will have you thinking, ""They *seriously* gave the guy who had the lead in 'Roots' this script?!""  The later?  Google ""Women in Refridgerators,"" and you will have a clue to the contents and how well they were handled.  And you'll likely facepalm a lot at Wesley, despite him being played by one of the high dukes of geeky things these days.  I mean, they wasted the *HELL* out of the cast here in a big, big way by recycling a whole mess of '70's crap and hoping we all would not notice.  We did.  You will.

Oh, there's warm spots.  Despite the porn line delivery, obvious pandering, and the way-too-sooness of ""The Naked Now,"" it sets up some truly amazing character moments down the line.  ""Conspiracy"" is nice and scary, as is ""Datalore.""  ""Where No One has Gone Before,"" feels like proper Trek finally showed up to the party.  Q is...Q is an experience and in multiple episodes.  I mentioned the funeral in ""Skin,"" being a solid and touching monologue, but it's a point that bears repeating.  ""Arsenal of Freedom"" aged more gracefully than most, with a storyline about drones which seems more timely now than then.  Any time they hand the scene over the Patrick Stewart it looks like a real show.  Frakes and Spiner are way savvier than the dialogue makes their characters look this season.  They work with what they have to bring some humanity to what could have been stock puppet characters.  Everyone else gets solid ""blink and you might miss them"" bits here and there which, again, set up a much bigger picture later.  Oh, and Majel Barrett-Roddenberry and Carl Struycken steal the screen away from the regular cast when they appear (in an awesome way!) in ""Haven.""

The key to enjoying this season is in 1) realizing this gets better - a LOT better and, perhaps more importantly 2) watching for those little moments.  A glance or an off-hand line this season is the stuff that *makes* fanfiction and repeated viewing possible.",1472428800,,2660,4.501043841336117

685947,1,6303574289,"After watching the original star trek show and star trek voyager I decided to watch this Star Trek next, only to find out how horrible it was.  It would appear that this show doesn't know if it should be taken seriously or not because the first season has many episodes that follow absurd plotlines which take the crew to; planets inhabited by 90% naked people or in another ""stunning episode"" to save a giant space jellyfish and its mate.  In fact there is not a single ""good"" episode in this season and after watching the entire series I can tell you there are probably 20 good episodes at the most (one seasons worth).  the acting is barley adequate and most of the characters are unlikeable.  It is apparent that different writers came to write out episodes because the captain (and other crewmen) will quite literally take a 180 degree turn in behavior and beliefs every other episode.  The captain violates ""The Prime Directive"" soooo many times but he belittles, degrades, and humiliates other people when they do it.  there are a lot of inconsistencies in the show like this which can become frustrating.  the only good Star Trek TV shows are the Original and Voyager.",1468800000,,1176,4.7073170731707314

I would recommend this series to anyone wanting to get into the star trek.

The effects still hold up and, in my opinion, look better than some of the later versions cg. The story is where it's at though. Watching the crew develop and work through and solve the problems and issues they come across is fascinating. There's a character everyone can relate to here and before you know it you'll be enveloped in the show wanting to see what their next adventure has in store.

Picard is a weak captain, unsure at best of his command decisions.  Worf is pretty much a snarling token, a waste of an interesting character.  Tasha Yar gets to act insane and karate chop anyone that blinks, yet remains as 'head' of security.  I suppose Picard was too scared to send her wild self on the way.  Data seems to take over every other episode, which gets old hat after so long.  Councellor Troi and the doctor...Ooofah.  Couldnt they get some hotness up on the bridge like T'pol from STEnterprise brought?

I am quite surprised to see that this version of the Star Trek series's is not yet remastered like TOS.  Even though it is technically broadcast in HD, some of the special fx work on the early seasons was pretty awful.  On a large format screen, this particular series is still being broadcast in some strange dimensions that garners black borders.  Feaux HD at best.  Lastly, Wesley Crusher.

687445,2,6303574289,"Almost twenty years after ""Star Trek"" was cancelled, it returned to television screens in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" This series was set many decades after the original, on a brand-new starship.

And if it weren't for the nerd-stalgia that viewers had for the old Star Trek, it's quite possible that the series would never have had a second season. Quite honestly, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 1"" is a pretty terrible season -- many of the stories are pedestrian and badly dated, like ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" episodes that weren't considered good enough and were left to gather dust. Even worse is the choking smugness and smothering sense of superiority, which makes sure to insult the audience at every available opportunity.

The year is 2364, and the Enterprise-D is being launched under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). But as the ship proceeds towards Farpoint Station to pick up the rest of their crew, they are waylaid by a seemingly-omnipotent alien creature who calls himself Q (John DeLancie). Q decides to put the human race on trial for past savagery, so the crew of the Enterprise must solve the rather obvious mystery of Farpoint Station to prove themselves.

Most of the following adventures are not much better, as the Enterprise deals with a ""drunk"" virus (a story recycled from the original series), a planet where stomping the flowers is punished by death, an interdimensional traveller, body-snatching energy beings, the unintentionally comical Ferengi (who only care about profit), a matriarchal society, a de-aging admiral, being hijacked by cyborgs, a tiny crystal life-form that has been killing terraformers, a killer tar-monster, and the discovery of cryogenically-frozen humans from the 1980s (boooo! BOOOOOOOOO! Hate them for when they were born!). Oh, and Q returns in order to tempt Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) with the same near-omnipotent power he has.

To be fair, there are some episodes that stood out, such as ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" where the crew is trapped on a remote planet where a weapons-demonstration system that is trying to blow up the ship. Or ""Conspiracy,"" a genuinely gripping story about a mysterious threat infiltrating Starfleet. But sadly, they are treading water in a sea of mediocrity.

""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" would later become a truly brilliant series, with excellent writing and some of the best sci-fi episodes ever written. But the beginning... well, to be frank, it sucked. It has the feeling of creative stagnation and tepidity, which was probably the reason that there was such high turnover for the writers at this point -- most of the season is made up of episodes that range from bland (""Justice,"" ""Coming of Age,"" ""When the Bough Breaks"") to ridiculous (""The Last Outpost"") to downright offensive (""Code of Honor,"" ""Angel One"").

One of the most irritating problems is the smug sense of superiority that suffuses many of the episodes. Series creator Gene Roddenberry was determined to have these characters be more ""evolved"" than the primitive, violent apelike people of the twentieth century... or in other words, the audience. So he never missed an opportunity to let the audience know how much contempt he had for them, or to have the characters smugly reassure themselves of how absolutely wonderful they were.

In fact, the season finale was about little else than Picard sneering at three ordinary people from the past, merely for not being as wonderful as they were. Another episode has Picard quoting, without a shred of irony or sarcasm, the ""What a piece of work is a man!"" speech from ""Hamlet."" Evidently nobody told him that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously.

And because the characters are so stiflingly perfect, they're not particularly likable here. The most likable ones are the android Data (played by Brent Spiner), blind helmsman Geordi (LeVar Burton) and the gruff Klingon Worf (Michael Dorn). However, the charismatic Patrick Stewart is utterly wasted as a grouchy, surrender-happy captain, Jonathan Frakes is stuck as the rather smarmy first officer, and the other characters range from underdeveloped to utterly useless (Marina Sirtis' Counselor Troi, who does little but sit around like a potted plant with cleavage, and occasionally get teary-eyed).

And of course, there is Wil Wheaton's Wesley Crusher. While Wheaton has since proven himself to be a pretty cool guy, his character here is utterly insufferable -- a Gary Stu in a baggy sweater, who constantly outthinks and outperforms the trained crew of a starship. He is Roddenberry's ideal ""evolved"" humans... meaning he's pretentious and smug.

But there are some flickers of hope in this sea of wallpaper paste -- a few episodes with intelligent or innovative ideas, with potentially devastating results if the crew doesn't handle the problem post-haste. In particular, it sows the seeds of an arc (sadly, never seen to fruition) about body-snatching aliens that were attempting to take over the Federation, and the episode builds up to a delightfully nightmarish climax.

The first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" shows little of the greatness the story would later attain, between the smugness and the mediocre stories -- but there's just enough there to keep it from being unredeemable. Just don't let the badness of this series keep you from checking out future seasons.",1449619200,7,5411,5.151480637813211
687506,5,6303574289,"I watched this show when it first aired on CBS on a TV with an antenna, and I faithfully and painstakingly recorded every episode on VHS--carefully skipping all commercials. Those tapes were with me through college, and then my wife recorded over them. We're still married, though I can't imagine why. If I'd recorded over her NKOTB PPV, it would have been all over. But I digress...

This BD release is extraordinary. It never looked even remotely this good on TV, nor on DVD. I watched the entire series via Netflix DVD and it was ho-hum, widescreen and nice but not surprisingly like this. Oh, no! The HD version is unbelievable! I did not ever know that the wall panels on the Enterprise were metallic--like aluminum or stainless--they even show reflections! The old versions of the show made those panels look like grey plastic. I had no idea the show looked so great. It really gives me a whole new appreciation for the amount of work put into the sets, costumes, and effects.

Speaking of effects, I can't tell if they were all redone digitally but planets and space scenes all look spectacular--like anything you might see in a modern show today. It is far better than the TOS HD effects which looked cheesy most of the time--better, but still cheesy in that great TOS way.

Having watched this by borrowing a friend's set, I am going to buy it for myself.

As for the quality of the episodes, I have read a lot of reviews and watched the Shatner documentary where producers have said that the first two seasons are almost unwatchable, they're so bad. I completely DISagree and feel those bad feelings were directed at Roddenberry, not at the final product. Roddenberry was hard to get along with, but these first two seasons reflect much more creativity than the later ones, which were designed for RATINGS rather than to present someone's future VISION of humanity. That was Roddenberry, and that's why TOS was cancelled originally--vision doesn't sell ads. I'll grant that changes had to take place for the show to earn income, but I liked Roddenberry's stories and vision and some things introduced in S1/2 were given up later.

Inevitably, to get the ratings, a big bad villain and huge space battle had to take place. OF COURSE. Americans sure do love their war and destruction and death, don't we? But I liked S1 and S2. If you're an old Trekkie (p.s. there's no such thing as a Trekker--those are posers) you'll see what I mean. Don't skip these two seasons. They're well worth watching--and owning.",1449619200,,2515,4.732876712328767

688177,5,6303574289,"I totally love the entire Star Trek franchise and have watched every episode and pilot. Star Trek: The Next Generation was eagerly anticipated by those viewers who had loved Star Trek. Twenty one years after Star Trek debuted in 1966, Star Trek: The Next Generation  made its television debut in May 1987. Gone were the cheesy sets and hokey special effects of the original. Gone was the rampant sexism. The New Generation was serious instead of campy. Though I had loved the original, I found myself loving the  adventures of the Next Generation just as well.

The first season is a little uneven, as the characters each work to find  their stride. The first season also introduces the viewer to Q, the seemingly omnipotent and quixotic being, who would become Captain Jean-Luc Picard's periodic cross to bear. John De Lancie is fantastic in the role of Q and Patrick Stewart is perfectly cast as the erudite and masterful Jean-Luc Picard. The rest of the cast  is uniformly excellent.

688219,4,6303574289,"I have to admit that I've always been a dyed in the wool Original Series Star Trek (TOS) fan. Because of that I was reluctant to embrace the Next Generation series. And for many years after its release, I didn't watch it. I had to get over the fact that it was a marketing ploy to milk the cash cow that Star Trek had become over the years after it's cancellation. That being said, I finally watched the entire series. I liked it. Not in the same way as the original (childhood memories were more dear), but as a separate extension of the Star Trek universe. The effects are good and although it took this first season for the actors and actresses to ""find their characters"", and feel comfortable playing those roles, it was worth hanging in until the entire series was complete. If you look at the first few episodes of the original Star Trek series, you'll find Leonard Nimoy shouting his lines in the pilot (1st pilot) and even smiling. Any actor has to become comfortable in the shoes he or she is wearing in order to define their emerging character. The writing on Next Gen is good in comparison to other television programs of this same era, and if you like a good sci fi, as I do, you'll definitely like this ride on the refurbished Enterprise.",1442275200,,1251,4.443478260869565

688728,5,6303574289,"Kicking off a new show is hard. Kicking off a new show with a history and following like Star Trek is even harder. Yet, Star Trek TNG succeeds on all points. Yes, the first season is a little rough as many first seasons, can be however, there are lovable character building episodes and the restore that was done to these HD versions makes it feel like a show produced today but with the added bonus of ""80's hot"" girls and guys. On this rewatch Denise Crosby's departure felt more out of place and unexpected than before, maybe even hit a little harder, because of the redemption she's earned over the years. Wil Wheaton's Westley is much more likable since we know his fate. Great first season, can't wait to get rolling on number 2!

As a side note, in my title I say this is perhaps the greatest TV show, and the reason I write that is the volume of quality episodes per season is astounding. We just don't see this level of quality 20-25 weeks a year from other shows.

World,
Please bring Star Trek back to TV!

688806,5,6303574289,"Ep 2 season 1- is what is like to be bipolar... Crazy fun. Like being the Joker except more fun, instead of homicidal- this episode details that feeling.

Now, despite the original Star Trek, The Next Generation is one of the best Star Treks of all time, for i can watch these episodes over and over... The essentials of Star Trek, actual science is used, they just visualize it's potential... Most of all, make us feel proud again, to be human, united, or good side, demonstrated over and over.

Today's generation isn't interested in science, do you gotta get the geniuses of today to change that- like hologram stuff...i mean all that is like the video game they got at home, that is old... What would the new generation be interested in period? There must be a scientific spin on that...

That is the problem today, they have everything... Guess that's why hunger games is popular... For it shows them a world they don't know, not having everything- but rebellion against rules, regulation, free to be me stuff... All self centered...i miss the good old days.",1438992000,,1063,4.704301075268817

I think they tried to not venture off to far from TOS, so we get the holodeck in which they can do episodes where it looks like they travel to an 'earth like planet'.
The characters are not as well defined as they will be, but it is enough to get you hooked.

The new looks are spectacular, however. The picture quality is amazing, and they remade the space sequences entirely in CG, as the model photography simply wasn't good enough for HD. Between that and the fantastic film remastering, TNG essentially went through post-production a second time.

This is the definitive version of TNG, and it's available for streaming in Prime but not Netflix. There's really no better way to experience this season, even if the episodes range from lackluster to straight-up terrible.",1435449600,,706,5.184210526315789

689697,5,6303574289,What can I say. This is Star Trek in the truest sense. Uphold the tradition of hope for the future and resolving difficulties for the sake of peace and caring about and helping others no matter where they are from or who or what they are. This made the old series timeless and the Next Generation follows in that same timeless tradition. The acting is first class. Not B movie actors. Real actors who know their craft.

689926,5,6303574289,"If you've never seen the original Star Trek you can get into Next Generation without too much worry. It starts off simple, but captures the same spirit that spawned it's creation. The crew grows on you as they grow upon each other like a family. After a fashion you forget the whole concept is pretty much a like a navy submarine mixed with a cruise liner.",1431475200,,356,4.409090909090909
689927,5,6303574289,"I can't imagine not growing up with this series. It approaches all the major issues of our society by using the device of ""exploring space"". It is a series that teaches tolerance, patience and open mindedness. It tackled issues of discrimination, genetic engineering, incarceration, self preservation, religious freedom, family dynamics, intermarriage, technology, etc; in a way that is thought provoking without being preachy. Each episode has some new lesson to be learned. The cast is very cohesive. The writing is top notch. It is set in a futuristic, earth based society that has achieved long  distance space travel and formed alliances with other species of humanoid, intelligent beings. The aim of the show is ""Space, the final frontier.....It's continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no ONE has gone before."". A family friendly show with timeless lessons to be learned by all.

On a personal note, I grew up with the original Star Trek and this one. They were both regular events in my household. I think humans use stories to inform their lives and actions. I find that I absorbed a lot from this particular series. The way the ship members would come together to seek eachothers' council, dealing with some very profound issues. Balanced and reasoned discussion informed by emotion but not ruled by it....Great fables for a new age.",1431475200,4,1418,5.055555555555555

690088,4,6303574289,"Acting started bad by everyone but Picard (Stewart), but got a little better pretty quickly.  Writing is very good.  Very outdated, but current for its time.  Still easily watchable for older people who don't not remember everything not modern.  I assume errors would be too distracting for younger people to watch, much in the way I couldn't watch the original ""Star Trek"" for the same reason (I was born 1971).  No modern equivilent has thoroughly investigated all concepts the way this program did; a lot of morals back then aren't present now, and although some modern programs approach some issues, they often come up with erroneous conclusions (usually by way of propagandized modifications or lost in a sea of crap).  Some modern morals are immoral.  Absolutely currently moral questions raised by this show could not be made now because current heavy censorship and politics would bar their creation.  Worth watching for everybody just because of that, but young people would have to pre-acclamate to deal with all the science and interaction errors.",1430352000,,1058,5.1104651162790695

690446,5,6303574289,"Incredibly well done. I remember catching the later seasons of this show on TV as a child, as the first season was on the year I was born. I grew up with Star Trek, as my father grew up with the original series and made sure to introduce me to the show at a very young age. It was a huge part of my childhood, as I was experiencing both TOS and TNG for the first time simultaneously, while being lucky enough to see The undiscovered country in theaters. It was a lot to keep track of at that age but it was amazing. I've seen these episodes many times, on TV, as part of TV marathons, generally on new years alongside three stooges marathons, both of which I used to tape religiously, many times on vcr, both commercial tapes and my own, complete with dated commercials. On dvd. Every time star trek came out on a new medium I'd watch through the entire thing. With all of that being said, I've never seen it like this. The remastered version is incredible. It's almost like getting all new episodes. Other times I've re-watched them, it's felt like re watching them. The re mastered version really feels like I'm watching these episodes for the first time all over again. Absolutely worth it in every way",1428278400,,1205,4.383928571428571

690602,5,6303574289,"If you are reading the reviews of Star Trek The Next Generation I'm going to assume you already like the show so I won't sell you on the merits of the series.

What I will comment on is the quality of watching it on Amazon Prime on my FireStick.

ST:TNG was originally broadcast in standard definition because the 90's were lame and all our TV's were awful. We didn't know it then, but seriously the picture stunk.

Through Amazon Prime you get TNG in a crisp clear way you've never seen before. IT's not full HD because the original filming wasn't done in HD. But just taking the original master video and showing it in a pure digital format on a modern large screen HDTV makes a huge world of difference. Many of the special effects and graphical elements of the series have been enhanced as well for this distribution and they look great, adding a new level of authenticity to the series.

I'm not talking about George Lucas style warfare on the original prints. They don't digitally replace Picard with Kirk or add unnecessary creatures to the backgrounds. And the Klingons still ALWAYS SHOOT FIRST!!! What they do is enhance some of the blurry or otherwise imperfect special effects from the original broadcast. Like in Encounter At Farpoint the alien being was just a light blob when it first aired. All the detail that was supposed to be present but couldn't due to budget and technology restrictions from 1987 are added back. So the enhanced special effects scenes now flow better with the rest of the episodes, which look awesome.

If you like TNG, rewatch it on Amazon Video. It's like seeing it for the first time.",1427932800,2,1625,4.628472222222222

690693,4,6303574289,"I loved this series as well, but for slightly different reasons. The original series (TOS) is great because hey, its original. The Next Generation (TNG for us Trekkers) is original in its characters while retaining the futuristic look and concepts we love. For me, the characters took some getting used to...as it did for the other Star Trek shows (and yes, I like them all). In the end, I found that it is the endearing qualities of these characters as well as the vision for the future that draws me in. May we continue to envision a future where we strive for the stars and set aside selfish and petty differences.

Oddly, I found the updated look of TNG to be of lesser quality than TOS. In a scene containing a multitude of colors, the dark colors (especially black) have grainy lighter colored pixels on them. The space scenes which are mostly black don't seem to have this issue. These artifacts can make it very distracting at times away from the story. Apart from that, it is in 1080p so kudos for the effort.",1427414400,,1018,4.532608695652174

It's worth having since you learn the early history of the characters. Another consideration is that CBS, the Star Trek franchise holder, sees the success of streaming through Amazon Fire & other devices & is not likely to renew their rental licenses. When that happens, owning DVD or Blu-Ray may be an even more attractive option. I defer to other reviewers about the quality of the DVD and Blu-Ray discs.  I've observed no digital artifacts with the sets that I own.",1426464000,,611,4.8

As TNG matured over the years it became a highly polished, sophisticated, fine-tuned, and extremely well written and acted series, the likes of which, we may not see again for awhile.  Television shows are linear in construct since they only operate in ""one universe or dimension"".

691607,5,6303574289,"Star Trek: The Next Generation had a lot to live up to considering the program it followed had been off the air for many years.  Any falter, any slip, any sign of weakness and the legion of Trekkie fans should be all over then like fuzz on tribbles.

Patrick Stewart, a classically trained British actor and man of the stage certainly seemed an odd choice for the role of Enterprise's next skipper.  However, his personality and charm would be his way into the fans hearts.  Jonathan Frakes, as his XO, was more the playboy that Kirk had been.  LT Warf (Michael Dorn) the token Klingon (now a friend-ish) and ever evolving forehead played the ship's obvious choice as pat of the security team.  Denice Crosby plays Tasha Yar, Security Officer (and token blonde hottie).  Brent Spiner has the role of Data, the artificial lifeform incapable of understanding humor or speaking a contaction, ""Don'tcha know?"".  Then we've Thunderthighs, Marina Sirtis as Troy and Gates Macfadden as the sultery redheaded doctor, Beverly Crusher.

These were huge shoes to fill.  Could they do it?  History tells us not only did they manage, but they kucked butt and took names.  Personally, I don't know if it was because of the line up or if it was because the time was right.",1423958400,,1257,4.741935483870968

The enterprise is now updated with new technology such as hologram deck, the ship can separate itself in two parts, uniform badge communicators, new styled phaser  weapons and control panel designs. Also in the series, the crew encounter a new and more formidable foe , Q who has the power to manipulate time and space by snapping his fingers.

Scattered amongst the first season episodes are a few gems but for the most part they are very uneven. The same illogical, inconsistent, and silly actions taken by the crew that I noticed back in 1987 still made me cringe today as I re-watched the episodes after not seeing them for a very long time.  Still very enjoyable for a Trek fan like myself and worth it just to see all the detail that was lost in the original not so glorious low resolution original video format.",1423008000,,572,4.447619047619048
691611,5,6303574289,I love it. I hope the rest of the season looks and sounds this good.,1422921600,,68,3.6
691648,5,6303574289,"The truth is that there is very little, if anything at all, that can be written about STTNG that has not already been repeatedly covered by reviewers and fans. I can't pretend to offer any greater insights than those already offered, but wish only to pitch in a few comments that arise from my own experience of watching all seven seasons of the show in Blu-Ray format.

Let's cut to the chase on technical quality. This is, like the earlier release of the original Star Trek series on Blu-Ray a few years earlier, simply a spectacular example of meticulous and painstaking recreations of the original video masters. Both shows ""sparkle"" with a crispness, clarity, and depth of color that seemed impossible to imagine. In the case of the original series, it is like watching the show for the first time all over again, with a level of detail and clarity that could have never before seemed possible. In the case of STTNG, I can remember watching the show on TV when it was first released, and thinking how impressive the effects and the set designs were (of course, ILM was doing the effects, and so they were up to the highest possible quality levels), but the show always seemed to have a subtle shade of what I might call ""80's beige"" that seemed to settle over the episodes. No more. This re-scan and re-edit of the original studio masters bring this show up to levels that make it appear as it was filmed just yesterday in native high definition format. Detail is crisp to point of astonishing levels. Clarity is superb. Noise levels are almost non-existent (with the exception of one episode, ""Time Squared,"" which, although was a favorite episode of mine, must have had the original masters lost somehow). The show just looks beautiful and lush, with gorgeous color set against a high definition screen. Honestly, its amazing what they did with this remastering effort.

Beyond this, it is pointless for me to further tangle with all the Star Trek questions: Kirk or Picard? NCC-1701, or NCC-1701D? Spock or Data? Overacting or underacting? Drama or thoughtfulness? Pushing the envelope or playing it safe? It's not really too important to me, those questions, because, in truth, these are two very different shows. They share the same heritage, but that's about where it ends. Many people cringed when Kirk and Picard had to share the same screen in ""Generations,"" but that's probably just an example of how different these shows are. They have different approaches, different characterizations, and, in some ways, differing goals. They are both hugely entertaining and thought provoking in their own right (I grew up as a child watching the originals, and then as a young man with TNG came on), and although it is surprising to think that now TNG is a quarter of a century old (ST-TOS is now more than half a century old), that distance can help us see both shows in the historical context in which they were made, and we can enjoy each for what they are.

But in returning to the remastering process that was undertaken for each show, these must surely rank as some of the most impressive works done in TV history. These shows now sparkle in ways they never could before, and as I said in my review of TOS, it's like an entirely new experience that even those who MADE the show themselves could not experience due to the limitations of the reproduction technology of the day. Thankfully, these shows were filmed on 35mm and made use of some of TV's great video technicians, and this is what has allowed the rescans to pull out such incredible levels of detail that were never before visible.

I may write a few more reviews on some of the separate seasons of STTNG, but for Season One, the one thing that sticks out in my mind is how much they ""got it right"" so soon. Imagine coming onboard this project with the legendary status of the original show. What a risk to take, both for the actors and for the production staff. And yet, with very few missteps, STTNG got off to a flying start, and, dare I say it (I'm contradicting what I said earlier about not getting tangled up in disagreements about the shows) introduced the greatest ""villain"" (if that is what he is) in the show's history, something I could have never believed possible after seeing Ricardo Montalban in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" whom I always felt was Star Trek's greatest villain. The character ""Q"" brought so much to the table so quickly that it allowed the cast to establish themselves and set the tone for a new ""Star Trek"" that would see it carried for seven seasons, and it could have been more, if the cast had not been so completely worn out from the whole thing.

So, what can I say other than, now that the entire STTNG show (all seven seasons) is now available in the remastered Blu-Ray format, run don't walk, to pick them up, and see the show completely anew. And if you haven't seen the Blu-Ray of the original series, I would say exactly the same thing, because it is an amazing adventure to see it in this format. Seven stars. No, eight.",1422489600,2,5041,4.627932960893855

692086,5,6303574289,"This review will be more about the Blu-Ray conversion itself than the content of the show.

What they have accomplished here is mind-boggling.  My wife and I are both huge fans of TNG.  She watched them on TV as they were aired, I watched them on VHS after seeing First Contact in the theater.  She bought the complete DVD series in the green and clear box set before we met, and we watched them together when we were dating.  My point here is, we are both well acquainted with the show and have seen it in nasty, terrible resolution, and slightly better DVD resolution, multiple times.

I make this point so verbosely because it will put the following sentence in perspective:  My wife and I were both absolutely blown away by the quality of the video and audio on these discs.  From Farpoint to the Neutral Zone, it is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears, and an amazing achievement for the team that performed the restoration.  This is by far the definitive version of TNG, and I am grateful that such care and attention was paid to this remastering.

Too often we see horrible, blurry upconversions thrown into a blue case and sold for a premium.  This is not one of those.  This is how it should be done.

Yet this season does have some classic episodes, it is the weakest of the series run.  I also much prefer the collared uniforms in subsequent seasons.

This edition is also not the HD remastered version of the series, that is available on Bluray.",1418428800,,399,4.5

Having had some of the vhs tapes, as well as the complete dvd sets, and, having been a life long fan of the show, I know that the colors on the dvd and heck, even from the broadcasts, are faded and lifeless. Sadly, that lesser quality is simply because the show was never properly remastered for the dvds. The studio took the existing vhs/laserdisc transfers and slapped them on to dvds, that's it, so if you want vhs/laserdisc quality, then sure, keep your original dvds, if, however, you want the show to look like it should have, and most likely did on the day of shooting, buy the blu rays, you won't be disappointed. The blu rays, as so many have already pointed out, are AMAZING! The show has NEVER looked better!!! GET ALL SEVEN SEASONS!!!!

So, when The Next Generation started I found myself hoping I would be just as pleased with the characters and stories. Well, I am happy to say I was.

692602,3,6303574289,"STNG Season 1 :
Oh my!  I forgot just how bad much of Season 1 was!
In general the 1st season acting and scripts were soooo bad.  I heard Rodenberry intervened in the middle of this seasons scripting and helped give them better direction.
  Riker walks around like a tin solder.  Troy is princess bimbo.  Wesley, with his silly s.e. grin ...ug.  Mr. Woofa Klingon with 30 inch waist and shoulder pads.
  The good acting skills of those playing: Picard, Data, LaForge, and Dr. Crusher helped bail the season out.  And gotta love (and hate) Q!
  Past the first half of the season, episodes do get better.  Yet some were still awful like Skin of Evil. So glad they killed Tasha Yar off in it (even if it was by her choice).
None the less, when this show was new I was hooked a faithful hungry for SciFi fan.
  The better Episodes:  5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25.

.Some of the best writers from the original Star Trek show were involved in producing this episode, which makes for a basically strong plot.  The character of the planet's leader and his culture are somewhat over-exaggerated, but I think the show still holds up pretty well over time.

Once they figured out that men wearing dresses looks stupid regardless of the century, they were well on the way to a great series. As much as I have grown to enjoy Q, their first encounter made the entire Q episode, look ridiculous. It is as though the writers had no clue as to how the scenes should play out so they just added anything that came to mind while smoking crack.

Still and all, after several episodes you can tell they began to put some thought into tying scenes together versus just throwing a lot of misplaced and disconnected issues into an episode.",1412121600,,668,4.475409836065574

Thank you Gene for bringing us one of the most classic sci-fi shows in the world. Rest In Peace in the stars. Oh btw Star Trek has been predicting Tech since the 60s.

693204,4,6303574289,"There were a lot of technical and character based errors made during this first season of Star Trek: Next Generation Season 1.  But as a whole it was a good start to an iconic series that outlasted the original by triple it's life.  This series brings to life a whole new cast and takes the phrase, ""To Boldy Go Where No One Has Gone Before,"" to a right and proper level.

The ensemble cast had so many faces that during the course of the first season one actor dropped out and with the beginning of the second season a second went behind the camera to be replaced with an actor from the original series.

Star Trek: The Next Generation was such a great piece of work and it allowed many talented people to really get their feet into the business where they were under recognized before.

Patrick Stewart once said, ""I did not realize what taking on this role meant til someone asked me, ""How does it feel to be the next American icon.""  I was there at the very first convention thrown after this season's shooting cycle concluded.  He was so fun and charming that I had no difficulty accepting him as the Captain of Enterprise D and as the great actor that I have come to know and love.

Many others Jonathan Frakas proved his talent behind the camera surpassed the evolution of his onscreen character when he took the reigns directing several future episodes.

In fact almost every member of the cast directed at some time during the series run which makes this series unique in the way it addressed talent.  They were allowed to contribute and grow throughout their time aboard the ship, in front of the cameras and behind them as well.

Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 1 though full of mistakes and flaws is absolutely worth watching to watch the rebirth of an iconic TV series that lead to many great movies like its predecessor.",1410480000,3,1840,4.5120481927710845

And adding effects where everything was fine already? True fans want to see this the way they saw it back in the day! Casual fans, go right ahead, purists: stay away from this AT ALL COSTS!

I also have to say this iteration of it had a rocky start, and not just because the characters were wooden and the actors didn't seem to know what to do with their parts.  Another problem, perhaps unrelated, was with the scheduling.  I never knew when or what channel it would be on.  But, it was Star Trek and I determined to give my best effort.  As the season progresses the issues smooth out and the actors find their stride.  By the end of the first season I was very glad I put forth the effort and stuck with it.  I have to say I loved Q from the first moment he appeared.

693574,4,6303574289,"When Star Trek TNG first appeared on television, I was excited. I looked forward to seeing the continuation of the show I had loved so much. When I actually saw the first few episodes, though, I was disappointed. It was not what I expected and, I must admit, I was a snob who preferred the original. I watched a few episodes but came away with the conclusion that the series was nothing but an excuse to play with Q or the holodeck.

For some reason, I let a friend talk me into watching the entire first season on DVD. I put it off as long as I could but eventually sat down and watched. Im glad I did. I cant say that TNG is either better or worse than the original. It is merely a different member of the same family. It has some of the same themes and concepts but it takes on an identity of its own as well. I am glad to have watched it and look forward to season 2.

Episode synopses follow:

1. Encounter at Farpoint -  This, of course, was the opening point for the entire series. It is a 2 hour pilot and introduces the main crew members and the famous Five Year Mission. It also introduces a recurring antagonist, Q and one of the most overused devices of the series: the holodeck. The crew is on their way to the mysterious Farpoint Station when it is intercepted by the superbeing, Q. He doesnt like humanity very much. He puts selected members of the crew on trial and sets them up to fail on the mission to which they had been assigned. Qs assumption is that the crew will face any challenge with savagery. The reality is quite different. DeForrest Kelly makes a cameo appearance as Adm. Bones McCoy. It was nice to see hes still cantankerous at age 139.
2. The Naked Now  While investigating the strange loss of the crew of a research ship, the conclusion is reached that they were all suffering from some sort of irrational behavior but there is no hint of the cause of the mass psychosis. Then the away team starts to come down with the same symptoms. This of course takes place in the neighborhood of a star which is about to explode so time is of the essence.
3. Code of Honor  The Federation is in desperate need of a vaccine which they cannot manufacture but which is made by a rather backward and technologically unsophisticated planet and the Enterprise is sent to negotiate a deal. The problem arises with very different cultures and expectations. The planets ruler is powerful but their standards, but poor. Wealth is controlled by the women. This prompts him to come up with a scheme that involves kidnapping Lt. Yor in the hope that she will fight his wife to the death. All would do well to remember the proverb about a woman scorned.
4. The Last Oupost  The Enterprise finds itself chasing a Ferengi raider that stole a piece of hardware from the Federation. All that is know of them is through supposition and rumor. They are seemingly brought to bay in the precincts of an unexplored planet but then it seems that the Enterprise is the victim of superior Ferengi technology. All is not as it seems, however, and there is something else going on. Though I have seen references to the Ferengi and briefly glimpsed them when channel surfing, this is the first time I have paid attention. They are portrayed in an extremely clownish manner.
5. Where No One Has Gone Before  An efficiency expert is sent to check on the Enterprises engines but there is something not quite right about him. The XO is concerned and soon the other become concerned as well. The expert seems to be able to do nothing more that express contempt and spout techno-babble is roughly equal measure. During an experiment, things go wrong and the Enterprise finds itself a loooooooong way from home. Then things get weird. The solution to the problem does not lie in classical physics but Wesley Crusher seems to have an intuitive grasp of the situation.
6. Lonely Among Us  The Enterprise is tasked to take two delegations from a planet to a diplomatic meeting. The two delegations are from two separate species and they loathe each other making for a tense voyage. En route, the Enterprise encounters a strange energy cloud and shipboard systems start to malfunction. That makes for an even more tense voyage when the cloud is not a suspect for sabotage but the two delegations are.
7. Justice  The crew of the Enterprise is in desperate need of some shore leave and it seems the ship may have stumbled upon the perfect planet to accommodate that need. Only beautiful people, which seem to consist exclusively of beautiful blondes, inhabit the place and free love is the law. Its a sailors dream. There are very few laws but the penalty for any transgression is death. Unfortunately for Wesley Crusher, one of the laws prohibits the damage of new plants and that leads to problems when he crushes a few trying to catch a ball. Things get a bit more complicated when the local version of a deity decides to become involved in a matter of justice.
8. The Battle  The Federation sends the Enterprise to a mysterious meeting requested by the Ferengi. After being made to wait for several days, the Ferengi present Capt. Picard with a derelict Federation starship Capt. Pircards former command! They claim they found it. They should remember to beware of Ferengi bearing gifts. The gift is actually an attempt to destroy an old enemy.
9. Hide and Q  The Enterprise is on its way to engage in a rescue mission after an industrial accident on a planet when the ship is stopped by Q. Apparently their last encounter intrigued the Q Continuum and they seek more information about humans. The bridge crew is abducted, sans Captain, and set up to play a game of life or death. Since Q is involved, it cannot be a fair game but Qs goal concerns recruiting not slaughter. He wants the Enterprises XO to become a part of the Q. Q-like powers lead to sever temptation.
10. Haven  The Crew puts in at the planet Haven for some R&R and find that their arrival has been expected. Counselor Trois mother is there along with the groom that has been arranged for her daughter. Both the prospective bride and groom seem a bit uncomfortable with the arrangements but that goes right over the heads of the parents. (Speaking as a pastor, this was very accurately done!) The situation is complicated by the impending arrival of a plague ship.
11. The Big Goodbye -  The Enterprise is sent on a diplomatic mission to restore contact with some touchy insects with a protocol fetish. The problem comes in that en route, the Captain pays a visit to the holodeck to try out a 1940s detective thriller where he plays the detective. The holodeck has just undergone an upgrade, though and there is a problem. They are stuck in the simulation and the bugs are getting testy about being stood up.
12. Datalore  The Enterprise investigate the planet where LCDR Data was found to find the planet is now completely dead. During the course of their explorations, the find the lab where Data was put together. They also find another version of Data. When that version is activated, it is very similar to Data but has some significant differences as well. He also begins to try and suborn Data and has a nefarious motive.
13. Angel One  The Enterprise encounters a derelict with no survivors aboard. The absence of  survival pods suggests that some of the crew got away. The Enterprises heads for the nearest planet capable of sustaining the survivors in the hope of effecting a rescue. The planets leadership are suspicious of the Enterprise. It turns out that the survivors are there and are wanted criminals. The women who run the planet want them gone. Meanwhile, up on the ship, people start coming down with a mysterious illness.
14. 11001001  The Enterprise has put into a space station to get its computer upgraded. The work is being handled by an alien species that practically thinks in binary. They are very good at what they do but something seems fishy.
15. Too Short a Season  Terrorists have seized a Federation diplomatic party and are willing to negotiate only with one particular, crusty old Federation admiral. The Enterprise is sent to deliver the admiral but hes a strange duck. For years he had been confined to a wheelchair but, as the Enterprise draws closer to its destination, the admiral is getting younger and younger. Theres another mystery in progress as well. There are no terrorists!
16. When the Bough Breaks  The Enterprise encounters a mythical planet similar to the Atlantis legend. Every there was perfect and peaceful and then they hid themselves from the rest of the universe. Now they have a problem. They no longer bear children. A trade is proposed in which the Enterprise gives them some of their children in return for vast knowledge. When the trade is refused, the children are taken by force.
17. Home Soil  The Enterprise is sent to investigate a terraforming station. Their communication has become confusing. When they arrive, the station personnel tell them that all is well but it is obvious to Counselor Troi that something is being hidden. When one of the station crew is killed in a strange accident suspicions heighten. An attempt of LCDR Datas life send them soaring. The culprit is not anyone that could have been conceived.
18. Coming of Age  Wesley Crusher is detailed to take part in a competitive examination for entrance into the Starfleet Academy. As he is dropped off, a mysterious admiral with assistant is picked up. The Admiral and his assistant wreak chaos aboard the ship. A secretive investigation is afoot.
19. Heart of Glory -  The Enterprise is sent to the Neutral Zone to investigate rumors of a battle. They find a derelict and the survivors are unexpected. The survivors are Klingons traveling on a tramp freighter of another species who claimed they were attacked by Ferengi in the Romulan neutral zone. Something doesnt add up. Matters are complicated because this is the first opportunity Worf has had to be in the company of other Kinglons. They want him to abandon the Enterprise and join them is setting the  galaxy  on fire.
20. Arsenal of Freedom  The Enterprise is sent to investigate the disappearance of another Federation ship which was, in turn, sent to investigate the disappearance of intelligent life from a planet of arms merchants. The away team sent to investigate quickly finds itself under attack. The Enterprise comes under attack as well.
21. Symbiosis  The Enterprise is investigating a star having some unusual magnetic activity when they discover a spacecraft in the system in trouble. Systems are failing and the orbit is decaying. The Enterprise tries to help but the ship seems to be crewed by morons who don't know anything. In desperation, the Enterprises mounts a rescue to save the crew but their cargo gets beamed aboard instead. They manage to save only four people whose only concern is to fight amongst themselves over the cargo. Two of the survivors from one of the planets carry a plague. The cargo is supposed to be the treatment. The other two survivors from a neighboring planet don't want to part with the cargo unless they are paid. The two planets have an unusual relationship and it is not a healthy one.
22. Skin of Evil  While trying to rescue the crew of a shuttle which crashed on an uninhabited world, the rescue team is blocked by a strange creature. The creature thrives on pain and conflict . It has severe psychological problems. It is pure evil. It is the cause of the death of an original cast member.
23. Well Always Have Paris  On their way to shore leave, the Enterprise encounters time ripples, where events seem to repeat themselves. They also receive a distress signal from a temporal physicist who disappeared mysteriously 15 years before. An experiment has gone bad and it is up to the crew of the Enterprise to patch things up before the fabric of space time is destroyed. Matters are especially tense because the wife of the physicist is an old flame of one of the crew members.
24. Conspiracy  While en route to a mission, Capt. Picard gets a secret communication asking him to meet other Starfleet captains for a secret conference. They reveal strange changes in Starfleet and hypothesize the existence of a conspiracy. Capt. Picard is dubious about it all until one of the ships that was at the rendezvous is mysteriously destroyed. The Enterprise heads to earth to try and solve the mystery.
25. The Neutral Zone  While waiting for the captain to return from a conference, the Enterprise stumbles upon an ancient derelict from earth. It contains the bodies of three people cryonically suspended. When the captain returns, the crew learns that they are being dispatched to the Romulan Neutral Zone to investigate trouble there. The crew is going to have its hands full with the Romulans and the revived corpsicles just make matters more complicated. The episode ends with contact having been made with a Romula ship but only the vaguest idea of what happens next. Its a season ending cliffhanger.",1404950400,,13002,4.689473684210526

693715,5,6303574289,"I watch Amazon Prime Videos every day while riding 5 miles on my stationary bike.  It makes the time pass faster and makes the ride less boring.  Prime video is a great service for that!

I've watched three seasons of the original Star Trek and now I'm into Star Trek TNG.  One thing I've noticed is that the audio is much better than the original Star Trek, which is expected since the original was done so much earlier.  I hear really good lows and crisp highs in TNG audio and the video is great.

Going back through the Star Trek series in chronological order gives the series much more continuity than when we had to wait a week to see what happened next!.

I'm not sure if HD has any meaning in Amazon online videos viewed on a computer, though.  I understand that 1080I and 1080P are only fed to certain devices.  My desktop computer where I watch these has a  high end AMD 8320 CPU, 8 gigs ram, and a Radeon HD7870  2gb video card.  My cable internet runs consistent 15.4mbps download speeds.

693717,5,6303574289,"I'm a huge TNG fan. The first episode aired when I turned 13 and I stayed with it through re-runs, Time-Life VHS club, and DVD. ""Why buy the Blu-ray?"" If you're a freak fan, like me, you know why you have to. Because this is THE SHOW!

I got this in the mail, opened the packaging, and put it in. There were tears, my friends. It literally felt like I was watching it again for the first time. I can only liken it to Geordi being granted sight for the first time when Riker was endowed with the power of the Q (Episode 10 ""Hide and Q). He was like, ""Tasha, you're so beautiful."" Yes, my friends. When you watch that episode, you'll be like, ""Geordi, (sob) I know how you feel!"" The cheese factor is 75% reduced. No. Joke.

What, no HD TV you say? I don't have one either. I have a huge honkin' 36"" SD TV with a Blu-ray player attached (yes it is possible). It might not be ""HD"" per se, but you don't need an HD TV to benefit from the enhancement.

Maybe you're thinking, ""Yeah, but I bet they changed everything and made it all weird with new stuff, like the original Star Wars trilogy."" YOU'RE WRONG! They didn't change a darn thing. They just made it beautifully clear, in all its beautiful HD clearness. All of the ship scenes were shot on 35mm film, so what you see IS the original footage (yes, the non-HD versions are ripping you off). A lot of the CG effects, however, were not up to HD snuff, so they respectfully added very similar things like planets, and explosions. I had pause for caution here as well.

There is one caution: It's presented in HD 4:3 ratio (I know, what the hell does that mean?) Well, you know what Widescreen is, right? Those black bars on top and below? Well, it's got those, but it also has 2 vertical bars on the right and left sides. This makes it look like the picture is encased in a black frame all around. This was done because the ORIGINAL footage was filmed for standard definition, broadcast television, which is a 4:3 ratio.

What does that mean, man? You're talking in riddles. Well, they ACTUALLY staged the sets, props, etc as if they were only filming for normal TV back in the 80s, the kind we all used to grow up with. So to include a full widescreen HD presentation would mean that you would see lights, c-stands, random crew members (other reasons are fully explained on the Blu-ray extras).

Yeah, it made me sad not to see my full screen filled, but it also made me angry that our original Star Trek episodes were hacked and resized to fit those standards. So, if you DO have an HD TV, you probably have the option to zoom the picture to fill the screen. For SD TV owners, well, believe me, I've gotten used to it, and it really doesn't diminish the experience for me.",1403827200,,2722,4.296296296296297

I paid twice as much for the original seasons, and at half price for these, they are about three times the content and quality. The ""Okoudas"" where involved in this project, and they stuck with the series ""originality"", painstaking, by their own confession, so I am guessing this was not only the studio's attempt to please the fans, but the ""Okoudas"" attempt to show the love of the series. Right now this has to be the most valued Star Trek product out there, labor, love, accuracy and beauty, all considered; just remarkable.

the product is fine.  it streams quite well and i enjoy it very much being on prime.  however comma the non-die-hard fans might want to view only the episodes recommended by friends.",1402531200,,561,4.653061224489796

Then I saw that Son's of Anarchy which is one of the worst shows I've seen in my life after season one, is rated higher than Star Trek the next generation.  How is that possible?  Anyone giving this show less than 3 stars shouldn't be rating this show at all.  I think people understand what kind of show this is by the description, the title, the name.  I understand that some people actually would rate this show a one or a two if they were forced to watch it but that is completely unfair.  I don't think anyone is going to read through the reviews and watch something because it has 4 or 5 stars when it isn't there cup of tea.  This is a sci-fi show and while there is lots of darker sci-fi and some do rightly criticize Next Generation for being a little on the flowery side, this show getting one and two stars is a joke.

The episodes are curious and interesting but can errantly influence human understanding of theology and science if not careful. Nearly all episodes address theological matters at some level. For example,  The Skin of Evil or Home Soil episodes. In the Skin of Evil episode the notion that evil is a veneer that can be cast off and trapped is quite counter to the Judeo-Christian spiritual notion of Evil. In Home Soil, the micro-crystaline lifeforms live on the surface of water and view humans as simply ""ugly bags of mostly water"".

It looks so good in fact, that its like seeing a brand new show, but one that you already love -  if that makes any sense. This is especially applicable to seasons 1 and 2 of STNG, where the original transfers were very dark and gloomy looking. I'm thinking that either they didn't know how to properly light the set back in 1987, or more likely they didn't have the technology back then to capture the quality of the original film elements on digital tape. The new transfers looks bright and hopeful, which far better suits the spirit of the show, and qualitatively helps it mach better with the following seasons. Enjoy!",1400284800,,904,4.413173652694611

But 48 years later it shows its age because so much happened in the next 20 years that we couldn't have anticipated. Star Trek: TNG takes advantage of the great leap of technology between 1966 and 1987 and creates more plausible sets and technology. I also think the more energetic pace, Picard's no-nonsense approach, and the strong human dynamics carve out a credible team and mission. It also helps that Paramount soon was putting $2M into each episode, and it shows--in the scripts, the sets, the actors and acting, the direction, you-name-it.

Star Trek TNG made countless advancements in the development of technology and sci-fi filmmaking, largely due to a new but remarkable company names Industrial Light and Magic.  Patrick Stewart is introduced as Captain Jean-Luc Picard who plays the intrepid leader of the USS Enterprise.  Picard, who is a intellectual, is a marked change from the pragmatic and charismatic James Tiberius Kirk.  At first I thought this may have been a mistake but Picard proves himself as no slouch when it comes to standing strong against injustice.  It was also strange to see the Klingon empire united with the Federation but this too was relieved when the alliance had even better foes in the Romulans and Cardassians.

694197,4,6303574289,"TNG is fantastic, that's not news to anyone. The port to HD is also quite pretty, i assume many of the special effects scenes have been remastered (and quite well). It's not widescreen, which is something i was a little disappointed in, but all in all, it's a surreal experience to see the beads of sweat on Picard's forehead in 1080p.",1396828800,,335,4.508196721311475
694198,5,6303574289,Excellent as always. Season one sets the tone for the second generation of the franchise and establishes the continuation of the story line.,1396828800,,140,5.130434782608695

694200,5,6303574289,Love it! Even more than the older version of ST (sorry Mr. Shatner). Watching these television reruns are almost like seeing them for the first time since it has been years since they were watched but this time is way better - NO COMMERCIALS! :D.,1396396800,,246,4.488888888888889

694244,3,6303574289,"Was fun to see the very beginning of the series, however they followed the tradition of marginal acting, over acting, and campy effects.  Having become accustomed to the very professional later efforts it was an eye opening reminder that everything grows and develops with experience including the viewer. All the characters and the enterprise features were introduced well but you can see that they were just figuring out their parts.

694285,4,6303574289,"While the HD quality is very good, the content lacks from the later seasons. They did spend money on the effects and sets, however.
I am glad they developed Worf more later on. In this season he seems clumsy and ill used. Picard is still finding his way as well. And I totally understand why Denise left...not much to do and was over shadowed by Worf, as awkward as he was...
I wonder when the later seasons will also be HD???",1395705600,,426,4.271604938271605
694286,5,6303574289,"A lot of shows are slow to start, characters, production value, stories, and 1st season certainly had some issues. But what Star Trek does best is finding a cast that you fall in love with. These people are no exception. I enjoyed watching these actors find the characters they are now known for and watching them create a legend. Don't get me wrong there are some excellent episodes as well, obviously, this season jump started a series that became the greatest re boot in Sci Fi history.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!",1395273600,,516,4.797752808988764
694287,5,6303574289,"When this first hit the air ways I did not want to like it.  It took a little while to warm up the all new series and the characters...but not too long.

It wasn't until recently that I watched all of TNG season 1 in order.

I have to be honest: Season 1 is not as good as the remaining seasons.

Sometimes, it's so bad that I have to wonder how it got picked up for another season.  But, I'm glad that it did, because this turned into one of the finest shows I've ever watched!

Any true fan of TNG needs to watch Season 1, since it does set the whole story in motion and lay the foundation for what is to come.

I recommend watching it and bearing in mind that, during this season, they were navigating the creative space between the original series and a bold new vision that it came to embody.",1394841600,,703,4.132352941176471

694353,4,6303574289,"Despite being relatively low tech compared to modern science fiction shows, I found TNG to be vastly more interesting than the few series I have actually viewed in recent years.

694354,5,6303574289,"In my opinion, Star Trek TNG is the best sci-fi series ever.  Of course the show is space based and exploration of the galaxy was the premise of the show, but it is soo much more than that.  It's about humans, their interactions and humanity itself.  The show has always given me a sense of hope for humanity.  That is just my opinion. Thanks.",1394668800,,343,4.3125

Picard, Riker, Data, Jordy, Worf the main characters defined careers of the actors. The series may have ok special effect in places (Hey it was the 80's) but the series dealt with real issues that make you think about what you would have done it if you were placed in the same situation.

Highly recommended for anyone who like space/SciFi shows. (Really the question is why haven't you watched this show?)",1394582400,,516,4.722222222222222
694357,5,6303574289,Love it. You can't just watch one. Captian Picard kills it! Also love the 80/90 costumes. And Data is the best,1394582400,,110,4.285714285714286

I watched a few of the first season episodes lately after having not seen any STNG for years.  The acting is moderately stiff and the dialog formulaic, and the series started off having some trouble getting over its self-perceived coolness: I mean, what, they spent 4-5 minutes of loving, lingering camera work on the saucer section separation that first time.  But later on the cast becomes a team, and they develop great stories around Q and the Borg among others, and Stewart becomes Jean-Luc Picard, the flesh and blood soul of a great star ship.",1393027200,,640,4.8

They are all about the same a lot of dialogue with a little bit of action in the last 15 minutes.  Typical for Star Trek the acting is goofy, and sometimes unemotional.

I watch this show on a 55 inch TV and the black bars on the side don't bother me one bit. The amount of detail on the upgrade is awesome. You can def see it when they show anything scene in space, the ships and even the planet view. Can't wait to see how ds9 and voyager will look like.

ST:NG is a different story. The studio knew they had a money-maker and supported it with great writing, nice sets and lots of talent. The advent of computer graphics and improved video helped this show tremendously.

If it had been just this season and then canceled, I'd give it more like 2 or 3 stars.  The plots, acting, AND teleplay/dialogue leave something to be desired.  The seeds of greatness were planted but they weren't in full flower yet.

But this is not about the quality of the episodes; it's about the quality of this presentation.

This re-mastered BD is as much better than the DVD as the DVD was over the VHS.  Even crappy episodes look sharp and snappy, and the few that were pretty good SHINE.

695377,5,6303574289,"Looking back, sometimes you wonder how you missed the often stark evolutionary jumps characters and sets were forced to undergo as seasons went on. Cases in point are Worf and the early homages to the original ST series.

First, Worf. In the early seasons of TNG, Worf is sometimes referenced as being large and menacing, or huge, when in fact he appears no bigger than cmdr. Riker. His head is overly large, making his body seem that much smaller, which doesn't help. On top of that, at the outset, he is also portrayed as animalistic, with his strange growls which seem very odd when coming from somebody wearing a StarFleet uniform, on top of his occasional fighting stances, which may very well be Klingon in origin, but just don't  fit a ranking officer who you might presume would be broken of such behaviors. Just strange.

Secondly, as time went on, the fx guys really transitioned away from the awful solid color backdrops and the various theme worlds (Roman world, gangster world, etc.) but incorporated Q as their tenuous thread to those old, terrible things. He himself being a rehash of the various demigod level figures that were faced in the original series.

 As seasons went on, these persistent bugs were stamped out, and the series achieved new heights in fx and seriousness overall. No camp, limited deus ex machina, and characters you actually cared what happened to- even the android.

Star Trek remains unique in its depiction of a unified human race free from poverty, hunger and warfare. A civilization which has outgrown it's pettiness and clannishness and superstitions and evolved to a point where they were prepared to join the galactic community; not just modern day people in tight uniforms, phasers on their belts, still hating one another because of skin color, or fighting wars over religion.",1379548800,,1826,4.912337662337662

When this Next Generation was advertised we did not know what to think.  There was concern in some sectors that the next generation would not live up to the original and its spirit.  We made sure our calendars where clear and watched the opening and were stunned.  It lived up to the first and did justify the work everyone had put into it.  The presentation gave you both the delightful aspect of ""Boldly Going Where No One Had Gone Before"".  There are many changes one of which was to change command to red shirts dealing with the ""oh no, they gave me a red shirt I am going to die"" joke that is still going around.  There was one error in the casting which was otherwise done brilliantly particularly in the casting of Brent Spinner to play the Android Data.  The one error was in casting Denise Crosby as Lt. Tasha Yar the head of security.  Her style of acting combined with her in with other actors and actresses all of whom showed brilliantly and showed maturity in the acting offset her performance leaving her performance looking lackluster by than alone. The way they handled her death, with the exception of the epilogue was just as bland as her performance had been to date.  It is said that they could not pull her up to their level.  That being said I think they handled her removal poorly.  This show is a good show with many good stories and on the most part good performance.  If have never watched it plan for a treat.  If you have seen it before watch again and see things you missed.

695661,4,6303574289,"i have been looking forward to watching Star Trek the next generation since I got my Amazon prime membership. I ""made"" myself watch Star Trek The Original Series all the way through as a devoted Star Trek fan should, and I kept thinking how one-dimensional the characters seemed compared to what I remembered about The Generation. This doesn't even factor in the obvious difference in visual quality between a show in the mid-to-late 60s and one that Debuted 20 years later and on Prime is in high definition.

I really expected a ""you can't go home again"" experience since I am not the 14-year-old kid anymore who saw the show debuted. But, Capt. Picard and company were perhaps even better than I remembered. He has such amazing command presence, And he is surrounded by such a strong crew that it is a joy to watch each episode. Like Capt. Kirk only in the respect that both are stiff, Kirk's stiffness is that Of a martinet who wants to be taken seriously. Picard's is that of a leader who has spent a lifetime being ""in the room"" when serious decisions are being made and without the routines of home and family to dull his sharp edges.

Teenage Wesley does a great job of helping the largely teenage viewership relate to such an austere figure, but this could also be the show's weakness. He too often tends to come out of nowhere to save the ship in a way to grownups cannot. Because he ""works"" as a character in that setting, it seems the writers tend to overuse him. But this is not enough to make a disappointment of the show.",1375401600,,1536,4.50179211469534

695664,5,6303574289,Haven't seen the series sense i was a kid. Watching all the seasons - boy does it bring back memories,1375056000,,101,4.1
695665,4,6303574289,"Bottom Line: While seriously flawed, this is a very enjoyable series and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed any of the Star Trek television shows.

If you are of a certain age, you probably saw Star Trek (The Original Series) on late night TV after the 10 O'clock / 11 O'clock news or maybe in the time between when school ended and before the local evening news. In my case, I found the stories riveting, the idea of a Star Fleet fascinating, and the goals of the Federation tantalizingly close to whatever a grade school or middle school student thought modern democracy should or could be.

So when, Star Trek: The Next Generation came out in 1987, it was meet with a lot of excitement and anticipation.  If you felt that way, then it is probably worth it to watch Star Trek: The Next Generation again either via streaming or DVD. In 1990, I moved overseas and didn't see the rest of the television series. Therefore, when I realized I could watch it via internet streaming (Netflix/Amazon Prime), I sat down and spent a month revisiting the Star Trek universe.

While I actually like Star Trek Voyager and Star Trek Deep Space Nine much better, this is a very solid series. I must admit that there were episodes that I found unwatchable and others that I found just really bad. However, overall, this is a solid story and, much to my surprise, many of the characters continue on in either Deep Space Nine or Voyager. There is even one scene in one episode where CAPT Picard is preparing for his annual counseling session with ENS Janeway - could it be the same Janeway from Voyager?

In many ways, the universe of Star Trek is one that could have been created by the kids in high school who took physics and math classes not for college prep but for fun. Many of the characters have issues with their parents, all the better to relate to the teenage angst that many of the viewers might be experiencing.

While Star Trek was reportedly intended to be a combination of a western and CAPT Cooke's voyage of discovery, there is a certain egalitarian and individual centric ethos that is advocated as part of the series. One of Gene Rodenberry's issues was that science would provide for basic human needs at little or no cost freeing mankind from some of its baser motivations. While a bit unrealistic, it does allow the series to portray humanity as we would like it to be as opposed to how it really is.

Many of the stories deal with what it means to be human. For my money, Voyager does a better job on those topics, but the ones in The Next Generation aren't bad.

Other stories are a continuation of the original series, but the different characters make the plots seem fresh.
The addition of a Klingon officer allows for the exploration of conflicting loyalties and difficulties in performing ones duty to family, Star Fleet, and culture simultaneously.

CAPT Picard is a bit more controlling and less of a swashbuckling rake than CAPT Kirk was. CDR Ricard, in part, fills that role. Diana Troi as the ships counselor brings an interesting aspect into the stresses of extended deployments. Whoopi Goldberg is really impressive in this series (I had no idea she was such a good actor).

Overall a good series, but I would rank it below both Voyager and Deep Space Nine. However, if you are a real fan, you will want to watch this series just to see all the Star Trek franchise.",1375056000,,3392,4.564144736842105

It was fun to go back to the beginning with all the characters, especially to see how young they looked! Also, it was interesting to see two people join the crew who had a history with a couple of current crew members. ""The Naked Now"" was an especially entertaining segment in which much of the crew became infected with a disease that put them in an amorous mood -- including Data!

My only quibble is that there isn't any written material with the set except for a list of episodes on the inside of the front cover.

695880,2,6303574289,"I've been watching Star Trek The Next Generation in order, I am 5 episodes into Season 3 and I have to say each season just gets better than the last.  If I had not remembered how much I enjoyed some of the Next Generation episodes on TV when they originally aired, I would have quit watching after Season 1.  Season 1 was definitely weak, but the characters are really coming into their own in Season 3.  I also enjoyed Season 2 a bit (especially after how poor Season 1 was) and now I am looking forward to watching the whole series.

So my recommendation is slog through Season 1 with the knowledge that it all gets better after that season.",1372896000,,644,4.341666666666667
695881,5,6303574289,This is a gift that I can hardly wait to give someone. I believe they will truly be surprised. Thanks!,1372896000,,102,4.15
695882,5,6303574289,I love this!  I never saw season 1 before...it was great!  I learned a lot about the early characters.  Thank you!,1372636800,,114,4.333333333333333
695883,5,6303574289,"I watched the whole series as a kid when they came out. I'm even more impressed now.  Great cast, well written (though it gets even better by the 3rd season), and still good effects even compared to current CGI technology.",1372636800,,222,4.55
695884,3,6303574289,"As a big fan of TNG, I've been watching it again and can see more easily the struggle to establish characters and direction that the show underwent in its first season.  It definitely picks up steam and improves with each season to become the more fleshed out show that we remember with such fondness, full of thought provoking plots involving characters who've become endearing and respected.  Don't let the first season prevent you from continuing the mission!",1372636800,,462,4.987012987012987
695885,1,6303574289,This re-issue of TNG would make sense if it was remastered from the new HD masters with all new CGI special effects. That would at least would produce DVD's of much better quality that the poor original DVD's. I own all the original DVD sets and I'm buying the Blue Ray sets. Re-issuing the old DVD's with nothing but new packaging is unforgivable sellout of the fans.,1372464000,11,368,4.507462686567164
695886,5,6303574289,Great show but shows up as a square box in center of display.  This is distracting but probably caused because the feed is sent as a HD when the program predates HD.,1372377600,,165,4.15625
695887,4,6303574289,Star Trek the next generation season 1 was a great show! Brought back child hood memories! It was a good but and the product was in great condition,1372291200,,147,4.285714285714286
695888,5,6303574289,"The picture quality is incredible!! The shows are even better than I remember. Voices and sound effects are very clear, and picture quality helps you notice details that weren't possible before. Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be made available in HD!",1372204800,,261,4.822222222222222
695960,5,6303574289,I like that this is not a fold out cover that will eventually rip apart with use as my kids get into it. Episodes are listed on the inside of the case not on the individual disk though. Not to big of a deal.,1372032000,4,207,3.727272727272727
695961,4,6303574289,The item came completely intact and the series is awesome. I can't wait to get the other seasons of this series.,1372032000,2,112,4.380952380952381
695962,5,6303574289,"I was excited when ST:TNG started, and watched it religiously.  I actually like it better than the original series.  This series spawned ST:Deep Space Nine, which was also an excellent show.  I only wish the Star Trek ""reboot"" movies had storylines of the quality that ST:TNG had.  If you're a Star Trek or science fiction fan, I think you'll love this series.",1371945600,,360,4.758064516129032

695965,4,6303574289,"I'm a big Star Trek fan, but didn't enjoy the early seasons of the Next Generation when they first came out.  Perhaps my expectations are lower now, but it is fun watching the episodes again.",1371945600,,191,4.457142857142857
695966,5,6303574289,Love Star Trek always have always will. Especially Next Generation. The caracters are great and are fun to watch.  .....good,1371945600,,124,5.2
695967,5,6303574289,"I love ST:Next Generation more than any other Star Trek. The characters are just more personable. Next Generation, like the original, is way ahead of it's time.",1371859200,,160,4.962962962962963
695968,5,6303574289,Looks much much better in HD...I hope they release Voyager and DS9 in HD as well. Any Star Trek fan will enjoy.,1371686400,,111,4.090909090909091
695969,4,6303574289,I have always felt that TNG is the best Ster Trek series in terms of quality writing. This episode features a classic example of Captain Picard defending humanity against a judgemental alien (who is later developed into the character Q). It's a little confusing because the characters and their relationships have not been fleshed out yet but overall it's a superb introduction to the disposition of the series.,1371686400,,411,5.0588235294117645
696010,5,6303574289,"This is a great show, and I love it. I have all the original Star Trek. Series and movies. Cause. I love SPOCK he is my favorite...Him and McCoy.",1371686400,,145,4.0344827586206895
696011,5,6303574289,"This is as Much a family classic around our house as the original. Getting to know the new characters, personalities, and captain is very family friendly. A little kissing but no bad language or nudity.",1371686400,,202,4.8
696012,5,6303574289,"If you like sci fi.  This show can suck you in.  They are truly a family, and while season 1 is not the best, the basis for the show is set.  We see characters develop and see the show morphing and feeling its way.  There are elements present in season 1 that are abandon later or at least modified.  It is enjoyable to watch this show so many years later and see how it begins to show age just a bit.  I love the rosy outlook they always have on this show.  Things usually end well and people are positive.",1371340800,,507,4.01
696013,5,6303574289,"As always, Amazon gives me a great choice of movies and shows to choose from, and always smooth, never a bad experience",1371340800,,119,4.454545454545454
696014,5,6303574289,I already loved Star Trek TNG but once i saw that they released it in HD i was so excited! I recommend watching every episode again or for the first time!,1371168000,,154,4.0
696015,4,6303574289,"A most TNG fans will admit, the first season is kind of a mixed bag in terms of script quality. However, the remastered HD editions look terrific (WAY better than Netflix's, which are clearly sourced from the old DVDs). If you're a fan, and you're not looking at getting the Blu-Rays, you really can't go wrong.",1371168000,,311,4.571428571428571
696016,5,6303574289,"Delivery was very quick, and I was very pleased.

696017,4,6303574289,"This was and is a great series! The Star Trek franchise has thrived do to shows like this!
Data(android) and the Borg are highlights of this series. Data wanting to be/feel human and the menacing Borg were great enemies!

696131,4,6303574289,"For me, this was a review of the original Next Generation series I watched religiously throughout its premier showing. Whether you missed it the first go-around or even during its re-runs, or whether you saw it decades ago, I recommend seeing any of the Star Trek adventures. You never know when might have a new insight from viewing these wonderful episodes. While the earlier episodes aren't as technically advanced as later episodes, the lessons and messages are still valid. No matter what, the entertainment level is always first class.",1370908800,,541,5.089887640449438

696133,2,6303574289,"As a lifelong Trek fan I had always avoided The Next Generation. I had NEVER seen the show until recently. I fell in love with it when I watched the first Trek DVD Generations, This season is fantastic, well written and acted. For me there is nothing boring at all about the show. Shop around for the best price you can find as it is pretty expensive everywhere (I paid 20.00 brand new). I only gave this 2 stars because of the packaging. The DVD case holds 7 DVDS and once you open it is almost impossible to close. A strange design and horrible to protect your investment. Maybe it is just my copy but be warned your case may not work properly either.",1370822400,10,653,4.274193548387097
696134,5,6303574289,Hard to believe this series started in the mid 80's. This series alone kept Star Trek alive and relevant. Kudos.,1370736000,,112,4.65

696136,5,6303574289,I remember when this season aired and I really was surprised when season 2 was announced because season 1 was really so bad I only liked about 6 to 8 of the episodes. the video quality is superb on amazon instant video.,1370736000,,219,4.238095238095238
696137,5,6303574289,"I already love ST TNG, that review would be moot. My review is of the quality of the re-mastering. The work done to enhance and restore, bring this series up to dvd quality, not Blu-ray spec, but close. Well worth the money. The musical score comes in a bit obtrusive at times, but is tolerable.
Warning, this Blu-ray will not function in older model players.",1370649600,,359,4.538461538461538
696138,5,6303574289,"I grew up on TNG.  I remembered the fuzzy picture.  I didn't mind back then, because all tv had fuzzy pictures - you just got used to it.  But to see it now in HD is absolutely amazing.",1370476800,,185,3.8157894736842106
696139,5,6303574289,this show was the second one in the series.  it started in the late 80s and used its focus on the characters and contact with alien species to teach us a lesson in the end.  the cast was good and that carried out the ideas well.,1370476800,,228,3.9347826086956523
696228,3,6303574289,I know it will get better but it seems such a let down from the preceding  Star Ship Enterprise. The actors need to be more believable.,1370476800,,135,4.1923076923076925

696231,5,6303574289,"I love Sci-Fi and stretching the imagination, which I think this series does very well. But I think the overall strength of this series is the characters. Of all the different Star Trek series, I always felt a real connection with the different characters in the Next Generation series.",1370390400,,286,4.857142857142857
696232,5,6303574289,I love to be able to have TNG on my Kindle @ a moments notice. If you start the next one before the last one ends it makes things simple to continue the season next time.,1370390400,,170,3.75

696235,5,6303574289,"Love the fact it jumped ahead 50 to 100 years or so. Good to get passed the original series and venture off to new things. But miss some of the battles with the klingons and other aliens, but Star Trek Enterprise ventured into that for us. Great series. Love Star Trek.",1369958400,,269,4.294117647058823

696237,5,6303574289,The First season of Star Trek the next generation was the best of all the seasons . it Created it's own  identity and was one of the best  Star Trek series ever.,1369872000,,161,4.0

696329,4,6303574289,for those that want the complete collection it is worth getting.  There were some great episodes in season 1... there were some painful ones to watch as well.  For those that love the extras and bonus features then its a pretty good buy and addition to your TNG collection.,1369785600,,273,4.551020408163265
696330,5,6303574289,I loved this series. My father and I watched it every week when I was a teen. Good bonding time.,1369785600,,96,3.85
696331,5,6303574289,I watched this all when I was younger and liked them. I am now going back and watching them with my Child and they are even better then I remember. They updated effects help too.,1369699200,,178,4.114285714285714
696332,5,6303574289,"I am not a ""trekkie.""  I was never a big fan of the original series and still can't stand William Shatner.  Furthermore, I still find many, if not most, of the  Next Generation's plots to be clunky and predictable.  And yet the sheer magnetism and acting abilities of Patrick Stewart created a character in Picard that holds this all together not unlike how a master puppeteer can make a bad puppet show seem enchanting.  I have seen each episode at least three times (yes, that does sound verging on the ""trekkie"") and still find watching Patrick Stewart's Picard fascinating as I continue to discover levels to his character.  Forget the kiddie sci-fi such as Star Wars, leave the comic book heroes unwatched, and instead watch thoughtful sci-fi meant to be enjoyed by thinking adults and brought to life by talented and creative artists.",1369699200,,840,4.839160839160839

696334,5,6303574289,It has been my favorite tv show since i was a teenager. I am so glad to see it again!,1369612800,,85,3.3
696335,5,6303574289,I love Star Trek so there really is nothing left to say; only that I am glad it started out low enough for me to buy it because for what it always sells for is really RIDICULOUS!!!!,1369526400,,181,3.918918918918919
696336,5,6303574289,I really enjoy these episodes.  I like shows that are interesting and not bloody or vulgar.  I'm glad they are available.,1369526400,,121,4.714285714285714
696337,5,6303574289,This is one of my most favorite shows from the past and was very happy I could watch it from season 1,1369526400,,101,3.6363636363636362

696404,5,6303574289,It was so enjoyable to go back to the very beginning of my favorite Star Trek series. Just to see the character grow and evolve was amazing.,1369440000,,140,4.222222222222222
696405,3,6303574289,"We were spoiled by Enterprise and Deep Space Nine, so when we finished them and returned to the older Next Generation, it seemed stilted in comparison.  We watched a couple of Season One, jumped to a couple of Season Two, and are not looking at Season Three, which seems better.",1369267200,,278,4.56
696406,5,6303574289,"The undiscovered episodes I found at least three that I have not seen before. The ability to watch  the development of Characters, in a ordered time zone is wonderful",1368921600,,166,4.724137931034483
696407,5,6303574289,"Captain Picard and Company are definitely my favorite iteration of Star Trek series and it is all about the casting and characters on the show.  They are all wonderful in their own right, but putting them all together is what makes the show really amazing.  The journeys that this crew takes are much more fun than the Original Series  (IMO) and I think it shows because they were on the air for so much longer!  Do yourself a favor --- sit back, start on episode 1 and try to NOT finish the entire season in a day or two!",1368921600,,522,4.242424242424242
696408,4,6303574289,"I am a Star Trek fan and I enjoyed rewatching watching these programs. I recommend them to anyone who likes this type of show because it is clean. Seldom hear a swear word and the series is safe enough for even young people to watch. Very little violence and always seems to have a way to get out of sticky situations without resorting to destroying and killing, but trying to bring peace and well being for all concerned.",1368921600,,422,4.423076923076923
696409,5,6303574289,The grandson loved it. Great series and eye-catching new packaging! Looking forward to purchasing the remaining sets in the series.,1368662400,,131,5.6
696410,5,6303574289,"The visual and audio quality are spectacular.  Details I'd never seen before in standard definition suddenly jump out at you, dumb things like the color of the trim on their uniform trousers (who knew it was there?) sweat-stains as they work under the stage lights and enhanced special effects make the show seem that much more real and relatable, as odd as that might sound.

If you're a fan, or you liked the show but haven't seen it in years, give it a try.",1368489600,,460,4.464285714285714
696411,5,6303574289,I just thought the packaging with the character's profile was cool! Love introducing this show to my kids! It's great!,1368489600,,118,4.95
696412,5,6303574289,"If  you love Star Trek TNG, you will watch reruns, love them, and won't bother reading reviews.  A non-Star Trek TNG fan wouldn't even search for season 1 much less read the reviews. But Amazon requested a review, so here tis: TNG is awesome. It was perfectly cast, superbly written, and often amazingly directed.",1368489600,,313,4.777777777777778

696466,5,6303574289,"I watched TNG when it premiered back in the day and I loved it back then.  After so many years and so many sub-standard transfers over the years, to see a beautiful remastered version like this leaves me virtually speechless.  The sound is very crisp(I was very lucky to receive one of the ""fixed"" blu rays) The picture is so clear that you'd swear this is a brand new show!  The special effects are much better than I remember and the shots of the Enterprise in deep space hold up very well all these years later.  I've started watching the show from the first episode and having forgot so much of what happened, it's just awesome to be able to watch it all over again and have it be even better than the first time.",1368403200,,717,4.288888888888889
696467,4,6303574289,"ST:TNG came along at a time there was very little sci-fi on TV and it was a thrill to me for the Trek franchise to be expanding. Now that it's being remastered in HD, its already high production values are further enhanced.",1368230400,,223,4.333333333333333

696469,4,6303574289,For whatever reason the sound track on episode 1 season 1 does not include sound effects which is quite strange but Next Generation is by far the best Star Trek made to date. Season 1 introduces you to the characters but is kind of all over the place as far as story line goes (which is the only reason this season did not receive 5 stars from me). As the season progresses you can tell that the writers begin to catch their stride and figure out exactly where they want this series to go. Do not judge Next Gen solely on this season! please please if you don't enjoy it skip straight to season Three when the action picks up and the actors are more familiar with their characters!! over all a great show and season 1 kicks it off quite well!,1367798400,,742,4.232394366197183

696570,5,6303574289,"I love every Star Trek series that has come on TV but I have never been able (till now) to catch all their episodes. Each series has it's own merits but the main thing with each one, and it is true of any drama, are the characters themselves and I think that is why the original Star Trek is still enduring today because of the wonderful interaction between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy, their friendship, their teamwork, and their loyalty to each other and the cause for which they serve. I love the new updated version of the original series, but enough about them. There are some who consider the original the best and I won't argue the point, but they won't watch the later series or don't like them near as much, but I think they are missing out as the newer shows are all excellent and Star Trek The Next Generation has its own qualities to be sure. Captain Picard is perhaps a more stern Captain than Kirk, but that's just my opinion I could be wrong, he can have more tender moments and some of his own weaknesses are revealed as the season moved on. Then there is Worf, a Klingon who's addition to the crew is explained in a later episode when two ""outlaw"" Klingon's are rescued from a dying ship and Worf's own loyalties are tested between his own inherent Klingon urges and that of Starfleet and the crew he has sworn to be a part of. Of course the special effects are much better than the original and new theme music but there are still moments when the original theme is heard. There are so many great characters in this series, such as Number One, the often stern but equally friendly second in command. Then there is the beautiful Mirina Sirtis (spelling?) as the woman who can sense when someone is lying or when there is danger when there is no apparent danger. Handy, huh? There is Dr. Beverly Crusher  and her son who is played by (then teen heartthrob) Wil Wheaton of ""Stand By Me"" and other movies, a ""15 going on 30"" boy genius who helped the crew get through some really tight situations. I believe that the lady who portray's Dr. Crusher is also the same one who does the 'computer' voice throughout this series and others as well as the movie versions. All in all I find this show very entertaining and now that I have streaming to my 42"" Vizio it is all the more fun to watch on Amazon Prime. Both the picture and sound quality are very good in spite of the need for rebuffering every once in a while I give it five stars. Amazon Prime is a great alternative to my satellite programming and it's plethora of ""reality"" shows that have gotten so boring, well except maybe Duck Dynasty (ha-ha) but that is another review.",1367020800,,2639,4.396728016359918

696771,4,6303574289,"First off if you already own the original ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" on the original first release DVDs than this release is not for you.

This DVD set includes precisely the same content (including bonus material) as the previous full-season TNG DVD releases. Meaning there is nothing new to this release.

This set includes all of the first season episodes of the show, and it get's a 4 star review because I simply do not like the new packaging as much as I liked the original first DVD release.
This release is simply to put the show back in the market as the original packaging is no longer being produced.

The price issue is not a big issue, if you have not bought the original DVD's than you are getting 26 episodes for about $1.80 per episode.  That is a good deal being most digital episodes sale for $1.99 or $2.99 for HD.

Being a lot of the original packaging for each season is still being sold here on Amazon you could get each season of TNG with the original packaging for around $40 dollars still.  Some sale even less if you look into other buyers.  The issue becomes when you need to purchase the other seasons. The price goes up for the each original dvd release season.  There is also the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series""  That is listed at $287 dollars.  Now each of the new release packaging for ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" is going to sale for $47 dollars.  If you add each season up of the new packaging you end up paying $305 dollars.  So the decision is going to simply come down to WHAT packaging do you like the best? (Prices have gone WAY down since this review, making this a sweeter deal!)

Do you like the new release look for ""The Next Generation"" DVD packaging?  Or do you like the older style?  If you go with the Older style packaging you will end up paying a little more for the show on DVD as some old box sets will sell for higher than $50, but if you go with the BOX set you end up paying $18 dollars less for the WHOLE show (as of now).  This new style simply allows you to buy each season individually so you don't have to DROP close to three hundred dollars right away.

You could always go the other route and buy the Blu-Ray's and spend a tone more for the show.  However, that route gets you the new special features and updated graphics, sounds and picture. It will also cost you close to $450 dollars for all seven seasons.

Picture:  What you are getting is the very first release of ""The Next Generation"".  While I am disappointed that this was not a cheaper way for them to put out the new enhanced editions on DVD to make it a little cheaper for others without a blu-ray player to pick up the show.  I am sure the reason was because they couldn't fit the new episodes on a DVD being it can only hold 8 gigs of data compared to 50 gigs of data on a blu-ray. This would have drove up the cost of the DVD's being they would have had to put more disk in this box set in order to give the whole enhanced show in DVD format.  This box set only has 7 disk.  The picture is fine and no real issues have come up on play back.

Sound:  Not much same as the original packaging. There is stereo 2.0 or Dolby digital 5.1. No issues on play back.

Overall impressions:  Not a bad release of the original show.  This is not triple dipping, like so many have wanted to point out.  If you do not own the show or if you do not own a blu-ray and you want to experience ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" this package is not a bad way to go.  Again with the availability of the original packaging and the whole show in a complete box set it comes down to what do you like better.  Do you go with the new packaging and save a little money?  Go with the old packaging and spend more for the original packaging, or just drop the whole $287 and buy the whole show at once.

For all the one star reviews on this because of price, don't buy it.  No one is forcing you to buy the show, but people that do not own the show and may want to start watching the show need to know what this package really is.  If you already own the show, why would you buy it again in this package?  No one is holding a gun to your head and saying you must buy this release, all they are doing is putting the show back on the market so people might not have to buy the original packing at a more expensive price or have a hard time finding the show on DVD.
It should not cost $25 dollars, that would be for a slim pack with just the episodes and no special features. This release includes all the original special features and again is simply a re-release of the original DVD set with new art work.

Also for people who say ""I will wait for a few years so it will come down to my middle class budget"", my only response is ""Really""?  Forty Seven Dollars is not that much for 26 episodes.  Were talking close to 20 hours of entertainment plus special features.  An average movie cost $20 dollars to buy, and with the movie you only get at most 2 hours.  Forty seven dollars is not hard to save for a few weeks on a budget.  I know people got responsibilities, but $47 dollars for that amount of entertainment is not asking for much.  The other thing about this release is it supports the studios that made the show.  If you buy the old release's that money goes to the retailer (Which is a good thing as well), but if you go with then new packaging and it sells well along with the Blu-Ray we might see a new ""Star Trek"" coming our way on TV again.",1364428800,39,5475,4.157644824311491
696772,5,6303574289,TNG is the definitive Start Trek series. Much better story lines and more substantial character development.  Any villain better than Q?,1364256000,,136,5.476190476190476
696773,3,6303574289,"...that pretty much sums up the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation from 1987-88.

The first episode -- ""Encounter at Farpoint"" -- WOULD have been a good introduction to the show and the characters but Roddenberry was compelled by producers to make it a double episode and so awkwardly inserted a terrible story involving Q into the proceedings. Q is a somewhat zany character with god-like powers, reminiscent of Trelane from the Original Series. Don't get wrong, Q is fine for later episodes, but he was totally out of place in this premier outing. It's not ten minutes into the story and Picard is zapped off to some goofy alien court for a trial. Beyond that, thankfully, Dorthy Fontana's story about the Farpoint station was fine as an introduction to the series and the characters.

The second installment wasn't too promising either, a bad remake of the excellent Original Series episode ""The Naked Time.""

Thankfully, the series began to show promise with subsequent episodes, like ""Where No One has Gone Before,"" ""11001001,"" ""Heart of Glory,"" and ""Conspiracy.""

696837,4,6303574289,"I probably can't say much more than other (more nerdy and retentive) reviewers have already stated.  So, I'll just give you my thoughts as I see them.

The fact that CBS/Paramount spent the time to remaster these 35mm film reels is worth 5 stars by itself.  I watched the originals when they first aired in the 80s and 90s, and have seen them in syndication on ""digital cable"".  The blu-ray versions easily outdo them all in terms of color quality and detail / resolution.  In certain scenes you can see a level of detail that you'd only expect from modern processes.  There are times where you really think it's amazing that they actually captured that much detail.

My criticisms are a few:

There is inconsistency in the picture quality from shot-to-shot.  Sometimes the picture is absolutely stunning, and other times not so great.... within the same episode.  Perhaps this is a result of different lighting or exposure techniques that were used at the time of filming, that weren't able to be salvaged properly during the transfer.  I don't know.  But, it's still something I've noticed.

Some scenes have a lot of ""snow"" in them... digital noise, if you will, particularly on the bridge.  At times, it borders on absurd, and makes me wonder if they intentionally added noise to the picture in order to make up for the bad resolution in the transfer process.  (If that is what they in fact did, I'd like to let them know that for future transfers, you can use VLC and achieve a much more pleasing visual effect of gaussian noise that gives the illusion of more detail, but without the absurd amount of snow in the picture.)

If they didn't actually add noise to the picture, then I wonder how the transfer process could differ so drastically from shot to shot, so that it would cause such an obvious degree of visible snow in the picture in some scenes, and little on others.

My criticisms are why I give it 4 stars, even though I want to give it 5.  Because it really is pretty amazing even given that.  I just hope in the future they tone down the noise.  Even if this is really the raw result of transfer, it really could be filtered better so that it produced a more visually pleasing experience that would make more people happy.",1363737600,,2240,4.580402010050252

Like any series it takes a bit for the characters and story lines to find their grooves, but it pays off well in the long run. Later seasons will definitely get 4 and 5 stars.  Patrick Stewart's (Pikard) acting carries many scenes and probably the first season.  Johnathan Frakes (Riker) starts to shine in the series as well.

After reading the news on Star Trek's website, I was extremely excited to see that the new repackaged DVD's looked cooler, and would be cheeper than the current DVD's..... well, they are NOT cheeper in price, only easier for CBS to crank out more so they can get a better return on their product.  Now with the shows coming out on Blu Ray, and CBS cranking out as much expensive merch on their own website, and the ST conventions a dream due to prices, I'm tired of dishing out my money to this franchise that I've been loyal to since before I was even in elementary school.  I couldn't even tell you how much I've spent on ST stuff over my lifetime, but with lack of appreciation at the top, I'm not doing my part to help line their pockets anymore.

I'll stick with my boxes of VHS tapes of eps recorded off of TV as I loyally watched the episodes and deleted the commericials.  At the very least, I'm only buying ANY Star Trek DVD sets from fans who no longer want them, but NOT from a retailer where the money goes directly to CBS.

Have fun buying this, and keeping the price of ST stuff expensive forever.",1363392000,14,1616,4.203883495145631

The show it self was great, and the remaining episodes didn't appear to have the problem.  I read this was a problem with the very first release of the blu ray set and was corrected by the producer in a few weeks.  The producers repaired the errors on the later release set.

696888,5,6303574289,"Simply put, the BD edition of Star Trek TNG Season 1 is amazing.  I grew up watching Star Trek TNG, and while I've caught reruns from time to time, I finally made the decision to get the BD edition (I hadn't purchased the DVD edition, so I cannot speak to their quality.)

One of the features in the set is about the BD transfer process; TNG was shot on film, and for the BD transfer, the production company went back to the original source material and transferred it.  Film is able to capture more detail than what was broadcast in 480i (the ""standard"" definition we saw it broadcast with) so by using the original source material, no upconversion was necessary--it simply was recapturing the detail that was ALREADY THERE.  It was a painstaking process, and is absolutely worth it.  Aside from some obvious stylistic nods, this looks like it could have been made yesterday with the best technology available.

There are several nice features exclusive to the BD release, as well as (I think) all of the features from the 2002ish DVD release.

I won't discuss the actual episodes, as I'm sure they've all been covered thus far.

If you're a fan of Star Trek TNG, do yourself a favor and get this set.  The attention to detail is superb, the presentation in high definition is amazing, and it's a robust first season (even if it has a few campy moments.)

If you have streaming video capabilities, I know at one point you could catch episodes on Amazon Prime.  If you're on the fence, this is a great way to see the quality of the transfer before you buy.",1362614400,,1556,4.541218637992832

I just watched the first episode -- encounter at farpoint  -- and it was a very unique experience. Why -- because the special effects sounds were missing. There was no engine sounds, no alerts sounds, no phasers sounds only the voice and music tracks came through. It was worth it... believe it or not those special effects sounds sometimes overwhelms the show. Seeing the ship moving in space in silence the way it really would, not hearing explosions where such sounds would not transiition actually made the mediocrity of the first episode much more engaging -- but unfortunately that means that some things that should have been there was missing -- when Picard yells to turn the red alert noise off -- we never heard the sound so it was out of place.

The Prime service price is really good -- there is huge savings if you order products via amazon in the way of shipping charges and you get to watch at no extra cost loads of shows such as Star Trek (all shows). Some shows are clearly the ""cut for tv"" like Star Gate SG-1 was, but others are just as it was meant to be by the producers Like Star Trek TNG minus the sfx audio track.

I am amazed at the quality of the HD picture and the 7.1 sound quality of these disks.  There are some issues, but the good far outweighs the bad, in my opinion.  It is not widescreen and this is due to the way the show was originally filmed and the technology of that time.  This is the only ""flaw"" I have found with this release.

If you've ever watched the DVD set of this series, you'll know how bad it looked in standard definition. This is one of my favorite shows and I haven't watched it in the 6 years that I've owned an HDTV. The picture was that bad.

Ever since I popped in the first disc of the season one blu-ray, I've watched nothing else. The visuals and special effects are no less than eye popping. It's really like seeing it for the first time. Make sure you watch the special on the first disc about what they had to go through to transfer this series to high def. It truly is a remarkable achievement.

Of course, when you've had to jump through so many hoops to piece this together, there are bound to be imperfections. Many of the low light scenes are grainy and there are some parts that look fuzzy, but compare these to the DVD and it's still a huge improvement. The special effects are the best part of this set. They are beautifully rendered and look cinematic in their detail.

I fear that the sales on season 1 and 2, the weakest seasons, won't be strong enough to continue with this expensive process. I believe that the work is nearly complete on season 3, which I'm really looking forward to.",1359331200,,1449,4.415730337078652

I don't think at this point I have to tell anybody how deep my love for Star Trek The Next Generation goes.  It was favorite TV show growing up, and remains my favorite TV show of all time to this day.  When Paramount and CBS Films announced that TNG would be coming to Blu-ray I was understandably excited that the TV series that played such an important part of my childhood would be remastered not only for lifetime fans to enjoy but also future generations.

TNG was shot on film, but all the editing and special effects were done on video.  That process locked the video resolution at 480P which back in the 80s and 90s was the industry standard.  Fast forward to 2012 and what looked passable on broadcast TV and later of DVD all the sudden looks unwatchable by current standards.  To bring TNG into the 21st century Paramount and CBS Films went back to the original film elements and remastered everything from the regular footage, the special effects, and the audio tracks.  It was a monumental task involving going through tens of thousands of reels of film bring these twenty-five year old episodes back to life. Simply put, the Star Trek Then Next Generation has never, ever looked or sounded better.

The show may look and sound better than it ever has before, but that doesn't solve all of TNG's earlier problems.  TNG suffers from a bit of an identity crisis, it had a revolving door of writers, and was often far to campy.  Performances range from wooden to laughable and aren't helped by the writing at all.  Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner offer up the most Season One highlights, but even they are not immune to some serious early series missteps.  Encounter at Farpoint, the series premiere is not a strong entry for the series and the rest of the first season had more downs than ups.

Season One highlights include: Where No One Has Gone Before, Datalore, 11001001, Coming of Age, Heart of Glory, and Conspiracy

Season One low points include (but are not limited to): The Naked Now, Code of Honor (aka ""The Brothers in Space"" episode), Justice, and Angel One

Fans familiar with TNG will right off the bat notice the improved the improved video quality.  The special effects like all the live action footage have been re-scanned from the original negatives.  ""Revelation"" is the first word to come to mind when talking about how TNG looks now versus how it looked before.  Colors are vibrant; the red in the Starfleet uniforms now looks how it was always intended.  Uniform colors aren't the only improvements; corridors, the sound stages, and ships are all improved.  There's a nice (if inconsistent) level of grain that gives TNG a film like appearance that was always missing from the TV/DVD video.  The improvement in clarity is also staggering to the point where it can at times show the limits of an 80s TV series.

TNG's audio has been remastered in 7.1 DTS-HD MA while the original Dolby Surround track is also supplied.  Viewers might not initially hear the improvements to the audio, but that certainly doesn't mean the improvements aren't there.  Everything from the hum of the warp drive to the opening of the turbolift doors will immerse the audience in the sounds of the Enterprise.  Phasers and photon torpedos rip through the soundstage but never in an overly gimmicky way.  Jerry Goldsmith's Star Trek theme sounds as eloquent as ever and is indistinguishable from its use in the Star Trek feature films.

Season One of TNG has a number of great new special features.  One of my favorite features is a simple one that was omitted from the DVD release, episode promos.  Before each episode you're able to watch the episode promo, they're great for comparison purposes providing a great look at how bad original broadcasts looked versus how they look now in HD.  The 90 minute long 'The Origin of Star Trek: The Next Generation' is split into three thirty minute segments: Inception, Launch, and The Continuing Mission.  'The Origin' documentary is in depth, informative, and even the life long fans will learn something new about TNG.  Other special features include a gag reel and four short archival featurettes.

There are some good episodes scattered throughout the season but most of it is merely passable.  Where Season One really excels is with the remastered video/audio and the new complement of special features which actually live up to their name.  For obvious reasons I won't recommend Season One of TNG to non-Trek fans but if you find yourself sitting down to watch reruns on TV or already own the DVD sets I can't recommend the upgrade to Blu-ray any more highly.",1356134400,5,5660,5.09002169197397

697223,3,6303574289,"I've always liked Star Trek TNG.  I've watched every episode dozens of times.  Long after the show was in re-runs, I would hunt around for TV stations that still showed TNG.  As one station would drop the show I'd find another that started carrying it.  So, I've seen the shows in their entirety and I've seen the shows cut down in lengh so that TV stations could fit more commercials in.  I've seen various combinations of scenes cut out for the purposes of TV comercials.

I KNOW when scenes or parts of scenes are cut out .  For instance in the episode ""11001001"" In this episode a race called the Binars come to upgrade the ships computer.  They distract commander Riker with a hologram in the holodeck called Minuet.  To regain control of the ship one of the things Riker and Piccard must discover is that Minuet is a password. That part has been cut out.  To someone like me, who's seen every detail in every episode this cut is blazingly obvious.  There are other cuts all over the place in other episodes.

I found this very disappointing.  I don't see where it says that you won't receive the full episodes as they originally aired on television but in fact get cut episodes.  I thought I was buying the full episodes.  I don't see where it says you get the full episode either.  However it certainly is implied.",1354320000,,1321,4.487394957983193

697274,5,6303574289,"I'm not going to give an exhaustive guide featuring a synopsis of every episode in this set. Instead, I'll be focusing on the audio and visual presentation, and the overall quality of this first season.

For those of you who might not know, Star Trek Next Generation (STNG) ran for seven seasons, spawning 176 (mainly) 45-minute episodes, and five movies featuring the crew. This first season made its debut with a 92-minute episode, Encounter at Far Point, which introduced the new crew, and gave audiences a glimpse of a new entity named Q (John de Lancie).

Before I talk about the merits of the show, there's an important piece of information that you need to be aware of if you are considering a purchase. The initial pressings contained several audio issues on three of the discs. Paramount offers free replacements without the need to send in the defective copies. In order to avoid having to do that, look carefully at the set before you buy it. Corrected copies have a yellow bar code on the back and the red Star Trek symbol on the spine.

Let's talk about the show.

I believe STNG to be the strongest of the five live action series set in the Star Trek universe, and it's not close. The original Star Trek has a certain nostalgic value and it was the first of it's kind. Voyager is enjoyable, and ranks second in my list. Enterprise is watchable, but without the same level of interest. Deep Space Nine is a show that I could never get into, despite multiple efforts.

STNG holds the top spot in my rankings because it has the best acting, the most convincing relationships, the strongest characterization, and a large number of well-written stories. However, my memory of the show proved to be imperfect. I know what STNG eventually becomes, but this first season is quite weak for the most part. I can imagine many fans of the original series giving up on this crew before STNG developed into the wonderful series it became.

What's wrong with it? The acting in the early episodes is nowhere near as good as in later seasons. People rarely refer to each other by their first name, and it's odd to hear Troi refer to Riker as Bill rather than Will. Data uses contractions when he is not supposed to be capable of that, but such oddities become less frequent as the season progresses. Denise Crosby is totally wrong for the tone of the show and stands around grinning in early episodes. Riker spends most of his time striking a pose, rather than acting in a believable manner.

The first good episode is the fifth one in the season, Where No One Has Gone Before. It was directed by Rob Bowman, who had a hand in 13 episodes during the show's first four seasons. Bowman was also involved as producer and/or director in 92 episodes of The X Files, so I am not surprised that he was responsible for the first standout episode.

Other good entries in this inaugural season include The Battle (Bowman), Hide and Q, Datalore (Bowman again), 11001001, When the Bough Breaks, Home Soil, We'll Always Have Paris, Conspiracy, and The Neutral Zone.

Despite the faults I have mentioned, Season 1 is a must-own for fans of the series. It gives important background information about the characters, such as Picard's attitude toward children, and we see the crew gradually becoming used to each other. I mean that both in terms of the scenario on the ship, and the type of chemistry that the actors developed.

Most of you are reading this because you want to know whether the Blu-ray is worth the upgrade. My answer is a resounding yes. The show is presented in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and it looks spectacular in 1080p. If you thought that Star Trek looked good, this will blow you away. As with the original series, Paramount has given STNG the DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio treatment, and the audio matches the excellence of the visuals.

With more than three hours of special features, STNG shines on Blu-ray. I never expected to see shows this old looking so good. You probably won't even notice the two seconds of footage that could only be presented in standard definition.

Okay, we all know what Star Trek is about, so I'm not going to go over the plot.  I will say that the stories are very interesting, well thought out, well written, and well acted. I really like how Star Trek touches on the 'Human Emotion and ""Human Element"".

I want to talk about the blu ray transfer, and it's outstanding.  The image is crystal clear and sharp as a razor.  I was honestly speechless watching it. I grew up with ST:TNG, and it was like I was watching it all over again. The colors are very sharp, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I'm always amazed on how colorful and vibrant the images are.

When I was reading other reviews, there were a lot of complaints on the sound.  UPDATE:  It seems that the further you go into the episodes, at times, the worse it gets. One of the episodes sounds like it was recored in a bathroom, a lot of echo and muffled.  Even though it's not perfect, I'm still glad I have it.

***UPDATE 10/6: If you have the early set, you'll have problem with sound on some of the episodes.  CBS/Paramount is having a disc exchange. Just send them an e-mail to: phe.stng@bydeluxe.com.  They'll ask for the code on the back of the disc on the inner right. It may be hard to see, but it's there. It took them about a week to send me the replacements blu rays. ***

Usually, I don't care about extras when it comes to DVD, but this has a lot of them, and they're fantastic.

If you have a multi-channel receiver capable of 5.1 or 7.1 output, it will take you like 10 secs to realize that the sound is wrong once you begin watching The Pilot episode! What did they use to check the sound - an iPad? And the replacement program that was announced is still not running (allegedly they've been finding more and more faults, now with the video as well), it was pushed into September rather than August. In addition, it does not cover all the territories. People who do not reside in North America are being redirected to the international site where they are being told to wait indefinitely since so far the only instructions were how to deal with the UK buyers.

697498,4,6303574289,"I want to start by saying I was one of the lucky few that went and saw Star Trek TNG in the theater when they screen 2 episodes for the release of this new box set on Blu Ray. Not only did they look and sound great on screen, but we also got to see some AMAZING behind the scenes stuff on the restoration of this fantastic show. It was these features that made me go out and buy this set. Normally, I am an Original Series fan first, but with goodies like these, I had to get it. That said, they should have raffled off a copy at the screening, but what are you gonna do. I learned they will be doing these screenings for each additional season's release, so go out and treat yourself if you get the chance.

First thing is first. Paramount blew it by releasing this set with not just one, but three defective discs. I believe they are discs 1, 3 & 6. How do you let this happen? At least they quickly got a hotline out there to have them replaced, so be aware of this if you get a set that is not an updated corrected release. This over-site is why the set gets 4 stars and not 5. They deserve a little hit for being that careless.

I'm not going into a huge spec discussion as I do not currently have the home theater to comment like that. I just moved and bought an HD TV, so my review will be based on seeing this as bare bones as possible. But it's coming from a fan and I know what you like. So, you'll have to dig around to find a more spec heavy review.

THE PICTURE: The picture looks amazing. The colors and contrast are fantastic. They went back to the original negatives and re-edited the ENTIRE season, so we will never see this show look better. I want to answer the big question everyone has. I often hear, ""If they are going back to the original negative and it was shot on film and they are recreating all the FX from scratch, then why aren't we getting a widescreen release of this show?"" Well, after seeing the BTS featurettes, I learned this...they can't. I thought to myself, that's BS. You shot it on film, that means you can go widescreen. Well, yes and no. What happened was, back int the day of ""square TV"" they were framing each shot to fit that environment, so when you go into the ""widescreen"" portion of the film, you see all kinds of stuff like light stands and crew members. Since you were never supposed to see the full frame of the film, they knew those elements would be cropped out, so sadly, we can't have a true widescreen release of this series.

That aside, the FX, unlike the Original Series complete redo, retains all the model shots done by ILM...just the atmospheres (planets, stars, etc) have been recreated. The Enterprise looks insanely good and their uniforms are vibrant. It's interesting to see that lighting from the first season. It has very heavy shadows, which they would eventually trade in for even lighting.

AUDIO: I can only say it sounds great on a quality HDTV with no extra speakers. The theater mix sounded good, if that helps.

EXTRAS: Totally worth it alone. Not only do you get great featurettes on the BTS of the restoration, but Paramount actually did it right an carried over all the ""Mission Files"" from the DVD release, or it at least looks like it's all there. So rejoice that we haven't been totally screwed on having to buy these again.

That's it. Hope you like them. Engage!",1345852800,6,3349,4.3147853736089035

697562,5,6303574289,"At first, I was hesitant about purchasing the Blu-Ray release of TNG, due to the fact that I worked hard to collect the entire DVD collection over a period of several years. While the video quality of the DVD's was subpar, they weren't any better when they aired on TV, so I was satisfied with that. Fast forward to this year, when I learned about the re-release. I decided to give the first season a chance, at the pre-order discount price. If I liked it enough, I would consider buying the seasons again and dumping the DVD's. Boy, am I glad I did. The quality of the video is amazing, and it makes the original tv broadcasts look absolutely terrible by comparison. Since it's restored from the original film, it looks like a true Blu-Ray. The visual effects that couldn't be restored were recreated in a very subtle fashion so that it looked original. The first season was not my favorite by any means, but I am enjoying these episodes immensely, merely because of the quality. The seasons aren't packaged as nicely as the DVD's, but the more I thought about it, those individual seasons took up a lot of space on my shelf and removing a disc was a annoying task. The new packaging is much smaller and more effective.

Since I can stream the other episodes from Netflix in the meantime, I'm going to sell my DVD collection and wait with excitement for the remaining seasons!",1345248000,7,1377,4.55241935483871

First, this episode deals with the question ""what is life?"" and invites the viewer to take on an open mind. It turns out that one of the explanations for the mystery that the crew encounter in the opening of the episode is in fact a new type of life form. Second, we get to see how humans deal with the emotional aspects of discovery, failure, and the unknown. The terra-forming crew members each exhibit a different trait such as obsession over the project, disbelief in the new life form, and sadness at their failure. Captain Picard, as usual, exhibits very decisive, pragmatic, and appropriate leadership throughout. There are some moments where solutions are found a bit too easily, or it seemed that the writers just had a ""writer's moment"" of conveniently placing a bit of information into the dialogue, but overall, this did not detract from the episode's main theme.

697566,2,6303574289,"This episode has a very captivating mystery where the crew is dealing with what seem as technical difficulties, but are really caused by some unknown entity. That sounds good. In fact, there are some good moments in the story where some sound logic and investigation practices are discussed. But then you got the cheesy moments of Data acting like Sherlock Holmes, complete with pipe and magnifying glass. I know there may be those out there saying that may be very much Data, but personally, I think it doesn't fit very well here. Not to mention the delegates on board and their silly antics trying to kill each other (two species that hate each other). I understand that it illustrates that the crew has big problems to solve and that stupid annoying distractions can get in the way, but seriously, there might have been better writing on that front. The worst cheesy factor is the way the episode feels hastily wrapped up. It's like the episode got this real problem going, where Picard beams himself and the entity within him into the energy cloud, but how do they resolve this? Oh, Picard's energy is still out there somewhere, and the transporter stored his physical self, and let's just hope Picard's energy self remembered to go to the transporter circuitry, and, yeah, it works. What?? Come on. That was cheesy.

By the way, I understand this was early on in the series, and I understand that Star Trek can be cheesy at times. But my review is based mainly on the fact that the premise of this particular episode got developed into a real problem that was resolved in a very cheesy manner. Just my opinion.",1344643200,,1615,4.686619718309859
697567,4,6303574289,"This episode reveals a bit about the Klingons and their beliefs and culture. Worf is challenged to join two Klingons that are on board the Enterprise into commandeering the ship. Worf makes a few interesting remarks regarding what a true warrior is, and reveals a little of his personal background. However, the episode itself is paced a little too slowly. Not that TNG episodes need to be replete with action, but for instance, the first scene on board the wrecked freighter just seems slow and pointless. There's a bit of time exploring how Geordi views through his vision device, but it doesn't serve the plot at all. Later on the episode's pacing starts to suffer again. Once the action starts, it's ok. There is one good stunt though in the final scene in main engineering.

Overall, good reveals about Worf, and good exploration of the concept of being stuck between cultures. However, the episode's pacing is too slow at times, with some elements that seem pointless to the plot.",1344643200,,986,4.834319526627219
697568,4,6303574289,"In 1987 Paramount undertook one of the bravest gambits in their history. They revived their most famous franchise, Star Trek, as a new, ongoing television series. Unable to afford to bring back the original actors, they created a new ship and a new crew, boldly going where no-one had gone before roughly a century after the events of the original series. Everyone expected the new series to flop badly, but instead it was an instant smash hit. 27 million people watched the pilot and the show would go on to last for seven seasons and 178 episodes (a hundred episodes more than the original series). It spawned no less than three spin-offs (the superb Deep Space Nine and the somewhat-less-accomplished Voyager and Enterprise) and led to a resurrection in small-screen SF shows of all stripes.

It would be fair to say that the series did not start off at its most promising, however. The show spends most of its 25-episode first season finding its feet. Fierce behind-the-scenes battles between Gene Roddenberry and his writers resulted in some muddled scripts, whilst Roddenberry's own vision of an egalitarian, equal future are let down by some dubious sexism (it's not until quite late in the season that the female characters get some interesting storylines and cool moments) and racial stereotyping (the episode Code of Honour is particularly wince-inducing in this regard), severe enough to draw criticism from the show's own star.

What saves the first season from early disintegration is Patrick Stewart's thoughtful and intelligent performance as Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Stewart hits the ground running and never gives anything less than 100% to the role and to the scripts, regardless of how hammy the dialogue or how embarrassing the storyline. His co-stars are more variable but generally improve as the season goes along, with arguably only Denise Crosby not hitting the same level of quality as the rest of the cast by the end of the season. Brent Spiner, in particular, embraces his role as the android Data with enthusiasm and aplomb.

It can also be said that, generally, the season improves as it goes along. Early episodes include the aforementioned stereotype-filled Code of Honour and the excruciatingly awful Justice (Jogging Aryans try to kill Wesley Crusher for crushing a flowerbed but relent when even their own Space Alien God thing realises this is lame). Elsewhere, the likes of Where No-One Has Gone Before and The Last Outpost hint at potentially interesting ideas, only to be weakened by sloppy execution. The failure of the Ferengi to impress as villains and the difficulty of using the super-powered Q (a fine performance by John de Lancie) too frequently both leave the show without a convincing set of antagonists, although the rise of the Romulans as a threat towards the end of the season does alleviate this issue. Later on we have more solid episodes like 11001001 (which sets up an intriguing alien race, only for them never to appear again), The Arsenal of Freedom (a brainless but nonetheless effective action episode) and Skin of Evil (which, despite one of the worst alien costumes in the show's history and some poor voice work, does offer up some solid dialogue and the biggest shock in the entire show's run), whilst even weaker episodes show some promise. Angel One has an unappealing premise (the crew visit a planet where women are the 'dominant' gender) but there are some surprising flashes of competence (particularly the notion of the women of the planet being larger and stronger than the men, who are all played by actors of limited height) before it falls apart into embarrassing sexism. Symbiosis sets up a genuinely unsettling and complex moral mess for Picard to deal with, but sabotages it with an awful, ""Drugs are bad, m'kay,"" message.

A special word must be reserved for Conspiracy, probably the most unexpectedly violent episode in the entire history of Star Trek and certainly the goriest, featuring people's heads exploding after being hit by phaser blasts and monstrous creatures (though awfully-realised) eating their way out of corpses. For those planning to revisit the series with younger children, caution is advised with regard to this episode.

Ultimately, the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is horrendously uneven. Even the worst episodes usually have flashes of competence, but there is a notable lack of really strong, totally satisfying episodes (Datalore and Heart of Glory probably come the closets, but even they have problems). That said, there is a certain amount of enjoyment and interest to be gained by seeing the cast improving episode-by-episode, and certainly by seeing the impressive remastering job that has been performed on the series.

To bring Star Trek: The Next Generation to high definition, a team of editors had to fully re-edit and reassemble every single episode from scratch. This involved retrieving the original film canisters (all 25,000 of them) from storage and re-inserting every optical effect in the series. It was a huge job, apparently taking some six months and costing more than $9 million for the first season alone (hence the somewhat high price for the Blu-Ray set). However, their work has paid off. The show now looks like it was filmed yesterday, with the re-editing of the show using modern equipment having the most satisfying side-effective of eliminating all bluescreen artifacts from the series. Matte lines around spaceships are now a thing of the past and the slight discolourations as characters passed in front of viewscreens or windows are now gone. The series looks vivid and impressive, fifty times better than it ever has before. Each episode is also accompanied by its trailer which remains in standard-definition, allowing viewers to see how effective the re-mastering has been.

This first season release is also accompanied by a number of new documentaries, featuring new retrospectives from the cast and crew on its creation as well as the new editing team on the remastering job. These documentaries are a welcome addition, featuring some interesting perspective and trivia about the series. All of the special features from the 2002 DVD release have also been included, albeit still in standard definition.

In terms of quality of the episodes themselves (***), the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation can be said to be 'watchably disappointing'. However, the fantastic remastering job and the extra content rise the overall quality of this set (****) to something far more worthwhile and interesting. The series is available on Blu-Ray now (UK, USA).",1344643200,14,6625,5.116451016635859

And to learn about the process to convert the old reels.

Crosby as Sela later on would be better.

Well, it's Season One. Having watched it many times over the years, I can say that certain episodes (Symbiosis, for instance) do not hold one's attention very well. On the other hand, other episodes (Justice, if you can believe it) really benefit from the HD upgrade, making them more appealing as a whole.

If you are somehow a new fan to the series, I still think you should buy this, with the proviso that things get markedly better even with Season Two, and certainly are totally cooking by Season Three. Season One is still a vital piece of TNG, introducing scads of characters and backstories. And there are still some superb episodes to be found (Encounter at Farpoint, Where No One Has Gone Before, Conspiracy, among others), and plenty of average shows, too.

Video

But these reviews aren't for new fans, are they? The question is - is it worth spending $60 or more to buy something you already own? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes!

To start with, overall detail has seen a huge boost, on a comparable or better level with the TOS Blu-Ray set. During facial close-ups, small hairs, pores, beads of sweat, and makeup details are easily visible. Costumes take on a new level of 80s cheesiness, with every crenelation, pleat, sequin, jewel, and bead being crisply defined. Buttons and displays leap off the screen. There is a stable sheen of film grain in most shots, which should make you happy, because it means that we're getting most or all of the detail present on the original negative. Color is another area that is light years ahead of the DVD. The DVD had a mushy, muted color scheme. Here, uniforms are bright, lipstick is ruby red, and spacescapes take on a whole new life.

The two areas of the biggest upgrade are any shots with visual effects in general, and space shots in particular. The way that the show was put together in the 80s, video compositing, led to a huge loss of detail, and the introduction of all sorts of jagged edges and blur. Pieces of 35mm film were essentially run through a VCR and cobbled together at that video resolution (480i). Here, all of the original individual film elements, including live action, visual effects, and model shots, have been rescanned separately and re-composited with modern technology. The result is astounding. Visual effects no longer lead to a degradation of the image. Space shots that were swimming with jagged edges and moire now look as good as current movies and television. The detail on the models is superb - as good as the TOS movies. The happy result is discovering how good many of the effects were, especially on an episode like Farpoint that had the budget to back it up.

Now, some purists will dislike the fact that certain planets have been replaced with CG versions. I think it was a good move, because the planet images in question were really the only ""bad"" effects on the original, and they would have stuck out like a sore thumb on the Blu-Ray. As with the TOS remastered effects, these planets hew close to the original color schemes and whatever details were in the original. I do wish that the originals were available with an angle switch, but it's really not a huge deal. We're getting the original models and visual effects, just played out over a few new planets here and there. It's not obtrusive and the results always look good.

There are a few episodes (Heart of Glory, Lonely Among Us) that featured many dark scenes, and these don't look great. They still, however, are a big upgrade from the DVD. As a rule, the brighter the episode and the more location shots are featured in it, the more spectacular the show looks. Farpoint and Justice, to my mind, are the real lookers of the set. The average episode presentation is at least as good as any modern HD television show, which is a real treat. And, thank goodness, the episodes are presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratio. Yes, they could have expanded the show out to a 16:9 frame, but the original camera work was composed, framed and matted for 4:3, which means that the extra widescreen space would be filled with lights, boom mics, and hairy union worker @$#-cracks. Do you really want to see those things? Not me.

Audio

Audio is presented in a new 7.1 channel DTS-HD mix. It sounds fine on my 5.1 channel set-up. I am not an audiophile by any means. What I want is an engaging presentation with some low frequency (bass) and surround sounds, but that doesn't drown out the dialogue. This fits the bill as far as I'm concerned. There are some reports of audio sync issues on a few episodes. I didn't notice it myself, but happily, CBS/Paramount is running a free disc replacement program for any users who desire it. Pretty cool if you ask me. Your mileage may vary.

Special Features and Packaging

The ""Making Of"" and Restoration documentaries would be worth paying ten or fifteen bucks for in a standalone release. That says a lot, I think, about the overall value proposition represented by this set. Both are presented in 1080p widescreen with subtitles. The Making Of doc clocks in at 90 minutes broken into three parts, while the restoration doc runs over twenty minutes on its own. Both are comprehensive and offer looks at things that even the hardest core fans (a class of which I consider myself a member) will not have come across before. The hair and makeup tests were a riot, and I loved seeing some of Andrew Probert's original concept sketches - such as a bi-level bridge with a conference table behind the captain's chair. Also very refreshing is some of the candor present in cast and crew interviews, with many reminiscing not just on the high points, but also the low points of getting Season One off the ground. The restoration doc goes into a very nice level of detail concerning how the original film elements were located and recomposited, what was done to alter certain shots (such as the planets) and why, and it provides copious before and after shots of the two editions.

What really shines through in these special features is the love that the creators and the restoration team had for the material. The whole production just oozes detail-oriented care, and really makes you, the viewer, who has just laid down some serious scratch for the set, feel good about what you've purchased. The icing on the cake is the inclusion of all the original DVD featurettes. So basically, you can sell your old DVDs on Amazon, donate them to an old folks' home, or use them as swank coasters.

The packaging is very similar to the TOS sets. The discs are in a blue plastic case with plastic ""pages"" holding discs. Irritatingly, the same flaw exists from the TOS sets - the discs do not list episodes on them, and the package insert only lists them on the inside, covered by discs in the case. I flipped mine around so that the episode list shows on the outside.

The package graphics are attractive. Picard, Riker and Data are inset on a Federation logo (no love for the ladies yet, alas), with some red graphics in the background. Presumably, the color scheme will match the DVD progression of colors, which will be nice for those of us who were used to them.

Conclusion

I think this is a must-buy for any fan with an HDTV, personally. The experience is markedly better than DVD, and light years beyond the original airing in the 80s and 90s. It looks better now than it ever has, and it looks comparable to a modern television show. The space shots especially look as good as most big budget movies. When you see the opening title sequence of Farpoint and the first in-episode shot of the Enterprise, you will be sold, I promise you.

The extra features are at a very high level of production and content quality, and lead to what I consider to be a strong value proposition. For the price you're likely to find this at online, you're getting an extremely strong audio-visual experience, with enough new material to really feel like a complete package, even for die-hard fans.

So, and you'll forgive me, if the question is ""to buy or not to by,"" the answer is: make it so!",1344211200,271,8072,4.636109167249825
697622,5,6303574289,"First off, let me say that Paramount loves to milk the Star Trek fans for every penny they can.  The Star Trek original series (STOS) has been release and re-released more times that I can count from VHS, Laserdisc, 2-episode DVD's, multi-episode DVD's, and now finally Blu-Ray.  I never purchased any previous release until the Blu-Ray, and I'm glad I waited.

The same goes for Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG).  I've rented the episodes whenever I wanted to watch them, but never purchased them, since I always wanted a remastered version.  Once again, I'm glad I waited.  Forget all the previous releases, this is the one you want.  Although quality control slipped when they shipped out defective discs, at least the studio stepped up to the plate and immediately offered replacement discs.  No excuses like, ""You're listening it to it wrong"" like some major companies like to do (You're holding it wrong, anybody).

Too bad I didn't follow my own advice for Star Wars, since I own about 6 different copies of that.  I guess I'll have 7 copies when the 3D versions get released.

I see the price jumped back up, but the initial $59.99 pre-order was a great deal.  If the sets stay constant, that'll be a $419.93 investment, but it'll be the last set you'll have to buy.  Well, unless Star Trek: The Next Generation 3D comes out in 4K format.  Ha Ha!

697623,4,6303574289,"After accepting TNG's first season as being classic TV (4:3) the blu-ray version continues to amaze with the depth of detail and coloration that the DVD release failed to achieve. My only complaint (addressed by the manufacturer apparently offering replacement disks)is that the sound in some episodes is so badly out of phase it cannot be played as anything other than monaural. Little items, such as small pieces untouched footage, might be annoying to some but I didn't expect every frame to be redone in crystal clear HD.

 Hence, four stars rather than five.

 This first set is good enough to introduce a new generation of viewers to the TNG universe and keep their attention. I hope that the full seven seasons are released in Blu-Ray and provided that the initial soundtrack issues are addressed, I see this as nothing other than a ""must have"" for anyone who likes intelligent Sci-Fi.",1343952000,2,892,4.887417218543046

The work they've done is flawless with just the right amount of SFX enhancements that do not destroy or distract from the original production.  You can tell everybody involved with this set treated the transformation with meticulous care and attention to detail and have not repeated the mistakes made in previous re-mastered series.

Keep in mind that this set is being remastered using the original stock film footage, requiring them to recreate the original edit piece by piece since the original episodes were mastered on video tape.

697628,5,6303574289,"I have been a long time Star Trek: The Next Generation fan so when it was announced that CBS was going to redo the entire TNG series on Bluray I was very excited. For years, I had to put up with lackluster video quality on my TNG DVDs, especially in the earlier seasons. The later seasons on DVD looked a lot better than say Season 1 but still I always just made the excuse that the show was made in 1987 and that was that.

Well oh my goodness this release on Bluray goes beyond my expectations.

Video Quality
If you own the TNG DVDs or have watched them on cable you will immediately realize that the jump up in video quality is SUBSTANTIAL! It is literally a night and day difference. The colors no longer look washed out or faded. Skin tones are natural. The level of detail in some shots is so impressive it almost looks like it was shot recently. Amazingly enough, some of the details that were unable to be seen in the DVDs can now be seen quite easily, such as computer readouts or text on doors, hallways, etc. The special effects were also re-composited and in some cases CG was used if they were unable to find the original film. For example, the Chrystalline entity was completely redone with CG and it looks VERY GOOD!! All episodes from Season 1 have been updated in HD except for 2 secs of ""We'll always have Paris,"" because they couldn't find the original film. The 2 secs in upcoverted SD is noticeable if you're looking for it. The menu for the episode actually notifies you of this missing footage (a nice touch). Overall, the video upgrade is so good that it makes worth upgrading your TNG DVDs on that point alone!

Also, the show is in 4:3 not 16:9. If you wanna complain that the show should be done in 16:9 then you obviously don't understand that its just not possible (at least not without spending a fortune). Please google the reasons why, I'm not gonna go into them here.

Audio Quality
The entire audio track for each episode has been remixed and it sounds a lot better. It won't blow you away or anything since TNG is not a particularly booming soundtrack but the sounds definitely sound more clear. I think the 7.1 was a little overkill for this release because from what I've read the show was not recorded with anything more than stereo in mind so the surrounds on a 7.1 system do not really get used all that much. I guess CBS wanted to bring TNG into the 21st century so to speak so they made 7.1. Overall, Its a great sounding set for a show that was recorded in 1987.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The original release of this bluray on July 24 set had an audio error on several episodes (audio channels had been mixed incorrectly). CBS has since released that they are offering replacement discs for the affected consumers free of charge. Please google this information just in case you get some of the affected discs.

Special Features
There are some excellent new special features on this set and the original DVD special features are also included. The two new documentaries explain how the remastering process works (very interesting) and there is also a documentary on how the show got started and how the cast came together (also very interesting). The new documentaries are approximately 2 hrs total.

Packaging
I personally think the choice of packaging was a good move by CBS. I honestly do not like big honking boxsets that take up way too much space on my shelf. This bluray set keeps in simple with 6 discs in an expanded blu ray case with a slip cover overtop. My only gripe is that the episode list is behind disc one so you have to remove disc one to see the episode list. I wish they would have included a booklet or something for the episode list.

To be blunt this remastering project for TNG is AMAZING. The quality difference for the video is mind blowing. Sure, season 1 of TNG is the weakest season of the show but there are still some good episodes. However, the quality difference in the audio and video is reason alone to rebuy this set.

Please everyone, support these bluray sets so all Star Trek shows can go through this remastering process. I also really want DS9 on BluRay :)",1343606400,10,4133,4.4635761589403975

697705,3,6303574289,"The video on this first season set is truly well done.  It is as sharp as you could imagine.  Luckily they stuck to the original 4:3 aspect ratio rather than trying to stretch or crop the picture.

However, the 7.1-channel DTS-HD audio is flawed on seven episodes.  On Encounter at Farpoint, the left and center channels are correct, but the right channel contains a mix of the intended right channel *PLUS* the center channel.  Other websites are now reporting the same thing.

The audio that you'll hear is with the dialog mixed far right.  So while an actor will talk from the center of the screen, the voice will come from the right side of the room.  ""Space, the final frontier..."" comes from somewhere between the center and right speakers (more towards the right).

How QA could miss this is beyond me since it is very very obvious.  Doesn't someone actually watch the episodes before releasing them?

Anyway, until CBS desides to issue replacement discs, this is a flawed set.  Stay away unless you plan to watch the discs in their original stereo (or mono, depending upon the episode) soundtrack.",1343433600,9,1105,4.757894736842105

697707,4,6303574289,"When I heard that Paramount was indeed remastering STNG to HD, I thought I'd wet my whistle and first watch the episodes as they had been seen when broadcast.  I never got around to owning the DVD set, as I could rent or stream them over Netflix.  My overall impression is that seeing the episodes in a new medium (that was only experimental when they first were produced) does bring new life to them.

I own the other Star Trek blu-rays: the movies and TOS.  Overall, I think Paramount has done a good job with their remastering of the first season.  I don't know why Paramount insists with remixing the whole Star Trek franchise with 7.1: especially since they don't seem to have done many enhancements to the old audio tracks, it's not like there's a whole lot of surround effects to begin with.  I don't find the dialogue panning on other speakers too distracting: the tonality all seems consistent. What I think is most lacking for lossless surround is very sparing use of LFE.  These are minor quips since it will always be questionable over whether to remain pure to the source material, or try to enhance and overemphasize.  The music and sound effects sound pretty good in DTS HD: the tonality of the spoken dialogue can sound muffled.  I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the original production values: when they were producing the TV series, it was with the budget and equipment for analog TV.  They probably could never have imagined that the show would eventually be remastered for a ""cinema"" quality medium.

There's also the aspect of how well the original source material has held up with age, and if there has to be a restoration.  Comparing TNG to TOS, it's clear that Paramount did have to do more for TOS.  They had a series of digital restorers go in and paint out speckles and color correct every film element.  They also completely redid special effects entirely with CG.  It is fortunate for Paramount and fans alike that at least all the original elements of TNG were filmed on 35mm.  With the number of episodes in TNG, it would be quite a bit more costly if the remaster required completely new CGI effects and a total restoration of every film element.  The previous SD masters all used the original special effects edits (in which film elements were composited and edited in SD video).  Because of the extra number of episodes with TNG, I'm not too disappointed that Paramount can't go in and do a film restoration.  The picture quality in this set varies with the quality of the stock film used, but there can be quite a higher level of detail.

Overall, the video holds up well in HD: especially the newly composited VFX.  Paramount must have archived the FX shots well: I think they were also shot on better quality film.  The special features on disc one does go over the digital editing techniques they used to recomposite the special effects.  There were also some rudimentary CGI characters like the crystalline entity that had to be re-envisioned for HD.  The clarity of the VFX shots really shine. The set shots with the crew can vary quite a bit, however.  You can now see some fine details and colors are richer, but it doesn't look like a brand new HD production.  The overall color range is limited: shadow detail in particular seems crushed.  There's also speckles and varying amounts of grain.  Video purists will be glad that there's not noticeable edge enhancement, and there hasn't been a DNR filter applied to scrub out the speckles/grain.  Considering the age and quality of stock TV film, I suspect that any other improvement (IE doing full restorations on all the set shots) would be cost prohibitive with the number of episodes present.  I also suspect that the upcoming seasons of NG will have improved visual quality (when the production became established, and they started using better film stock).  Blu-Ray dot com's review of TNG teaser set seems to indicate that's true (They rated Encounter at Far Point to be lower quality, and I suspect that later seasons of TNG will look better due to better grade film/production costs).

So in summary, this new BD set from Paramount will be the definitive set for TNG...probably for all time since some future 4k home media wouldn't be of much value for a TV series originally produced for standard definition broadcast.  Paramount has done a good job of taking the old 35mm elements and remastering them to HD.  The series holds up well in HD, and is a definite ""buy"" for any ST fan.  I rate it a 4 out of 5 because of the limitations of the original source material hampering the picture quality from consistently looking like it was shot ""just yesterday"" for HD.

*edit* now that I'm noticing there are quite a few rumors floating around here, I feel like I should follow-up.  CBS/Paramount has not issued a statement yet about whether they will re-issue changes.  There are a few episodes where the dialogue is still mixed with the stereo channels (and not strictly on the center channel).  I don't find these episodes to be that ""faulty"" because the dialogue often is perceptually ""center"" (it's hardly ever imaged immediately right or left).  I also have full range tower mains that are tonally matched with my center speaker (so the dynamics are pretty seamless). If it's too distracting for your preferences/ speaker configuration/ you can switch these episodes to stereo (don't believe the rumors of some missing 2 channel mixes: I've confirmed that my copy has 2 channel mixes).

CBS/Paramount may issue new surround mixes if there's enough complaints for the episodes that are more stereo centric.  Time will tell about whether CBS/Paramount will remaster these episodes (the main consensus is 7 episodes). My review stands at 4 out of 5 stars for this set: the quality of the video and audio is the best this series has ever been presented in, and qualities won't change if there is an update in imaging with the 7 episodes.  I don't find the stereo imaging to be too distracting, but YMMV.  If CBS does re-issue, or offer a replacement program, my above review will still stand.

******edit 2*****
As of today, 7/30/2012 CBS has issued an official statement in which they are offering a free replacement program to address the surround track of the 7 episodes.  Kudos for CBS to offer a replacement quickly and without requiring upgrading to some future set.  I'll send away for the discs so I can compare.  I suspect my initial impression of the audio will be the same: the sound effects having some good dynamics with the dialogue being slightly muted.

697708,4,6303574289,"Ten years ago, Star Trek: The Next Generation warped its way to DVD.  At the time, the thought of having complete seasons of the Next Generation were something that was unprecedented.  It was also to spurn interest in Star Trek: Nemesis, the tenth film featuring its cast.  In fact, I believe The Next Generation's complete season sets may have given birth to numerous other shows getting complete seasons of their episodes.  But ten years later, and not a moment too soon, Paramount and CBS Blu-Ray have issued the complete Season 1 set.  Despite the fact the season's episodic content has aged really badly since it premiered between September 1987 and June 1988, the newly enhanced picture gives the season new life.  The visuals are just stunning (just look at ""The Naked Now,"" and you'll see how well the experts at CBS Digital have done), and the new special features.  Speaking of the first one, called ""Energized: Taking Star Trek: The Next Generation to the Next Level), can the online Trek community just shut up and deal with the fact that the ratio for the remastering is in 4:3, instead of 16:9?  They explain that if they did it in 16:9 (now the norm for all TV shows and films released on home video), they would have had to include the rafters and other picture equipment.  I do love the other special feature, called ""Stardate Revisited: The Origin of the Next Generation.""  It is in three parts, and what happened before the production of the series (even interviewing the much hated Rick Berman, and Stephen Macht - who was Roddenberry's and Associate Producer D.C. Fontana's choice for the role of Picard) and what happened after it premiered.  I love this set, unfortunately on some of the episodes, the audio quality isn't the greatest in 7.1 Digital.  Some of the dialogue (it's mostly in the Captain's Logs by Stewart, believe it or not) appears filtered, but if you put it in the original audio, it's not too bad.  I enjoy this set, and if CBS-Paramount wishes to issue a brand-new set with the corrected audio at no additional cost to the consumer, then I'm all ready for it.  But if they don't, it's okay too.

No other audio is affected in these episodes, and the audio presentation is otherwise pristine and fantastic.  Personally, I find this to be pretty minor, it did not detract from my enjoyment of these episodes at all.  I have not experienced the reported audio sync issue on any episode or special feature present on the set--I suspect this may actually be an issue with some users' blu-ray players and setup.  Blu-ray players can exhibit audio sync issues when under heavy load, if you have your blu-ray player set to simply pass video and audio without any additional processing and allow your audio system to decode the audio, you probably won't run into this issue.  For reference, I'm using a PS3 and Sony STR-DH810 receiver.

The result is you see elegant, fine details from the hairpiece on Troi's head to a new, more stunning looking Crystalline Entity. Careful compositing was done to reproduce effects like transporter beams and phaser shots so it matches the look of the low-res images, but is more brilliant and eye-catching than ever while still remaining VERY strict to canon.

This entire series was overseen by Michael Okuda, who had diagrams for how to construct the effects for every scene, and armed with his recollection, expertise, detailed information, the original films, and of course the old video, they've re-created Star Trek: The Next Generation as if it had been freshly taped yesterday.

They were unable to use widescreen format, for doing so would crop the old picture information, or require them to create expanded scene and model/matte images which simply were not there beyond the 4:3 ratio that was on film. So yes, although it is Blu-Ray, it is in the old TV aspect ratio. To do anything else would be to compromise the color purity and scene composition, so in wanting to stick with canon (and keep the release schedule down to something less than a decade), they went with this.

If you've never seen this series, this is a TERRIFIC starting place. If you've not collected it yet, this is the most shelf-efficient format of all the collections. The entire first season fits in a wide (not double size) Blu-Ray disc case, with slip cover. I highly recommend it, as it's very relevant and entertaining even these decades later.",1343174400,10,1825,4.877419354838709
697758,5,6303574289,"This is a Review for the Season 1 Next Generation Blu-ray.

When I first heard about this project, I assumed they would just be upscaling the SD video version of the series, as many elements (transporters, phasers, etc) were created on video in the editing process. So, I moved on and didn't think much of it. Then, I saw what they were ACTUALLY doing, taking the original film negatives and recutting the episodes frame for frame from scratch and recreating elements done on video with higher resolution effects. Kind of like what George Lucas did with the special editions of the Star Wars Blu-ray, only slavishly recreating everything AS IT WAS in higher quality instead of making arbitrary changes. Once I saw a few pictures and the promo video, I decided to preorder it. Even though I can watch this on Amazon Prime or Netflix, I know they won't be there forever and the quality is amazing. I'd been intending to buy the DVD set, but never got around to it (thank you Netflix Instant for staying my hand)I got the set yesterday and started watching the first episode. I only got about 15 minutes in before I had to go work on something else, but the results are stunning. The textures just POP out of the screen. Things that I never would have noticed before jumped out at me. A little bit of fluff on the carpet in the bridge. You can see that the gray grid on the wall is made up of suede squares (you can see the brush marks from someone's hand!).

Pros
The picture and audio is ridiculously good.
The Special Features are really informative - especially great is the featurette on rebuilding the series for HD.
I can't even tell you how blown away I am by everything.

Cons
I want a bigger TV and a 7.1 Surround Sound System. So, no cons really :)",1343174400,9,1756,4.464174454828661
697759,5,6303574289,"One reason I've always preferred ST: The Original Series to The Next Generation is the original series looks bright and colorful and vibrant (even in standard definition), and Next Generation always looked dull and flat and washed-out.  (I remember a friend commenting in 1987 as we watched the new series, ""The exteriors of the Enterprise look so fake now -- one-dimensional."")

No more.  This new Blu-ray is a joy to behold, and puts you right into the center of the action.  Special effects now seem ""real.""  The colors are just that: COLORS.  Even ho-hum episodes (and there are more than a few of those in this first season) are engaging and exciting because the picture and sound are so good.

Before watching any episodes, check out the new featurettes -- they're superb.  One is an inside look at how the high-definition re-do was accomplished, and it's fascinating to watch.  You'll have an appreciation of just how much work went into producing this set after seeing it.

Another is an exhaustive three-part documentary with new interviews with the entire cast and many of the original production crew (including David Gerrold, DC Fontana and Rick Berman).  One impressive thing about this documentary is that it doesn't shy away from the behind-the-scenes angst that was going on during season one, and paints a rather feet-of-clay portrait of Gene Roddenberry.

I was a bit reluctant to buy this since I'd already invested in all 7 seasons on DVD -- but am sure glad I did.  Stunning!",1343174400,7,1496,4.888888888888889

This is an update for all who purchased (blu-ray) Season 1 - as this is the only information that needs to exist now that the audio problems are addressed and there is no longer a need for a breakdown of every detail.
I doubt any other review will make it this simple.

If you were concerned about your purchase and requested replacement discs by contacting CBS / Paramount (in care of Deluxe Media Management from Valencia, CA), they began sending out the replacement discs this week.

However, you should be made aware of another disc problem and CBS responded without telling anyone that they added another to the replacement program as many (including my own daily calls and e-mails) have continued to request that CBS / Paramount pay attention to additional problems.

What you'll receive: disc 1, disc 3, disc 4 and disc 5.

If you do not receive all four discs or haven't contacted CBS / Paramount yet, the contact number is 877-DELUXE6 (877-335-8936) between 8am to 6pm Pacific, Monday-Friday.

It is unknown how long this disc replacement program will be in place.

You should also know that retailers kept the product on the shelf to sell it anyways, regardless of the complaints of the audio issues.

DO NOT BUY THIS SEASON SET UNLESS IT HAS YELLOW UPC CODES / SCAN BARS ON THE BACK.
White printing indicates the original issue with the problems.
Buying used copies with white UPC Codes?
I wouldn't unless you see proof of replacement discs - delta shields have been printed on the newer replaced discs.
On new packaging, look for the ""delta shield"" printed on the outer slip cover and the binding of the case.

What's a delta shield?
Think of those communicator badges worn by the Next Generation crewmember.
A delta shield is the design of the badges.",1343088000,29,1780,4.7564935064935066

The show just pops off the screen...It's like watching the episodes for the first time all over again! This set is definitely worth the money, and I haven't even watched all the episodes yet.

During the course of the past 25 years I have owned different iterations of home video releases; from VHS tapes to laserdiscs to the DVD sets released several years ago. This blu ray set blew them all out of the water hands down. There is simply no comparison between the DVDs and this new blu ray set. Paramount and CBS deserve high praise for the time, effort and money that they have evidently invested into remastering the show. I saw details in visual effects, costumes and sets that were simply not visible before. The on screen menus are much better designed than the previous DVDs, the bonus materials are interesting and the sound quality has been improved. For anyone who enjoyed TNG purchasing this set is a no-brainer. If the quality established by the Season 1 set is any indication of things to come, I eagerly await seeing all of TNG's run again.",1343088000,17,997,4.606741573033708
697830,5,6303574289,"OK so many of you may have noticed that the Blu-Ray hasn't been released as of this writing. Fortunately for me a certain local retailer is really bad at sticking to release dates. So on to the review

First of all let me get this out of the way like a typical Star Trek series the first Season was painful to watch. With bad acting and no particular direction at the beginning. That said I want to address this Blu Ray. I was thankful that the the show was preserved in it's original full screen (4:3) format. This is very important as this was the only way to preserve the show. The whole show was shot with the intention of being full screen. Which means the only way to get this into a 16:9 format would be to zoom in on the picture and cut off the top and bottom. I'm very thankful that they didn't do this. If you don't like the Full Screen use the zoom button on your remote. The next thing about the restoration is that this show was originally mastered to analog tape. Meaning they filmed it and then converted it to standard definition analog tape and added the effects there. So the only way to create a good HD version of this show was to literally remaster the show just like they would have originally. The nice thing about this is they didn't feel the need to do what Lucas did to Star Wars. The goal was to keep everything as original as possible but in HD. They didn't add random monsters or new scenes. I go into this because this was a best case scenario of an HD restoration and it shows. The video looks beautiful it's crisp with all the details preserved. The film noise is still present and didn't fall victim to DNR. Occasionally you can see a white spec here or there but nothing overly distracting.

Basically I'm thrilled that they did this and rushed out to get it to see how it came out. If you own the DVDS sell them and get this I can't recommend this more. I hope Deep Space Nine and Voyager get's the same treatment eventually.",1342915200,24,1960,4.266129032258065
697831,5,6303574289,"This is really important.  Please allow me to say this.  A lot of people would love for this to be fixed...

As I'm sure is true for many of you, I have seen every episode of Star Trek: TNG at least twice.  So, all I WANT to see here is reviews of the QUALITY of the new Blu-Rays (and the new Bonus Features).  But with over 200 reviews for the old DVD releases all mixed together with the new BLU-RAY reviews, they are very hard to find!!  I have complained to Amazon about this before, and so have a lot of other people.

A growing number of people have become beyond frustrated about this.  ESPECIALLY because Amazon has Totally Blocked Me (and others) from doing more than one review for the same product in different colors and sizes that we Actually OWN!  Here is what happened to me...

Amazon has scolded me twice already for posting the same review under identical products of different sizes or colors.  The second time, they said that if I do it again, they would revoke my reviewing privileges.  This is exceptionally annoying and frustrating since Amazon has been LINKING movie reviews under TOTALLY DIFFERENT FORMATS of DVDs and BLU-RAYs.

Here is another example, even worse than this one:  The exact same 1,291 Reviews are under The Wizard of Oz original single DVD, and the restorations, and the Blu-Ray, And the Emerald Edition, And the 70th Anniversary Set, AND the 2 Disc, AND the 3 Disc, AND the 4 Disc sets!!! ... So ALL the reviews about the Quality of the Restorations and the Bonus Features become totally worthless because you don't know which version the customers have reviewed!  And really... WHY does The Wizard of Oz need the same 1,200+ reviews for every single release?  Do they really think no one has ever Seen this movie?  I'm pretty sure that most people are looking for reviews about the bonus features and quality of the restoration, but it's almost impossible or extremely time consuming to find anything out with over 1,000 reviews all mixed together!!

Somebody needs to start a petition to get Amazon to unlink all movie reviews, TV reviews, and other product reviews, and allow the rest of us to post identical reviews under identical products that would actually be helpful, when we know what we are doing!!

When I phoned them about this, they said they would let the appropriate dept. know, but nothing ever happened. I have seen many complaints about it, but no matter how many people have said that they have told Amazon about this, Amazon does nothing to improve anything in their mixed reviews.

On top of this, Amazon has a terrible search system.  Almost nothing works right when searching for things.  If it weren't for the huge number of well-written customer reviews that usually work right under most products, and the great prices on Amazon, I wouldn't use it at all!!",1342915200,10,2826,4.678137651821863
697832,4,6303574289,"It will be exciting seeing these in all the HD glory they were filmed in. I still don't think it is clear to some people that 4:3 was the way they were filmed. There was nothing cropped from the original film that was not shown on TV. To make the series widescreen they would have to crop a significant amount from the top and bottom.  The price may seem high, but compare it to Doctor Who's 13 episode seasons to the 26 episodes here -- not that bad.",1342656000,7,451,4.125
697833,4,6303574289,"A lot of reviewers are disappointed that CBS Digital didn't convert these to 16x9.  I love 16x9 presentations. But if a show just isn't in that format, there's not much that can be done. From interviews I've read in the pre-release press about TNG Blu Ray, it seems that they simply didn't shoot the ""show"" or ""story"" in the 16x9 sides: They have ladders, lights, production stuff in the far sides of the shot. To fix this they have 2 choices: Zoom in on the 4;3 square, which would negate the conversion to HD to begin with, or literally CGI every ep to remove all the stuff we're not supposed to see.  Option 1's resolution would look awful, Option 2 would be cost prohibitive.

""The Wizard of Oz"" is still (mostly) presented in 4x3, known back in the pre widescreen days as ""Academy Ratio.""  HD TNG is in good company, then.

Simplest solution is to do the zoom yourself if you must. Most HDTV have zoom, so no stretchy-football heads, though there may be some foreheads cut off at the top.",1342569600,20,993,4.464088397790055
697912,4,6303574289,"In addition to his awesome chin dimple, I remembered that Riker/Jonathan Frakes showed his hairy chest, but I couldn't find the episode.  Thank goodness for google!  This episode was more fun than I remembered.  The episode deals with gender issues and takes place on a planet where women outpower men.  Riker's chest hair exposure is purposeful: it's meant to contrast to the small, smooth-chested male character indigenous to that society.  The loose shirt he wears doesn't even have an Isoceles triangle cut, it moves to one side so that you see one of Riker's nipples.  Instead of just seeing chest hair, a character rubs through Riker's chest hair for extra emphasis.  Move over, ""look but don't touch!""  The Wikipedia page about this episode shows Frakes' hairy chest, so I really think this is what makes the episode so memorable.  Supposedly, when William Shatner learned that an interracial kiss with Uhura was going to make history, he made sure he got to break that barrier.  I wonder if Patrick Stewart said, ""I can't have Frakes outdo me!  I want to show off my hairy chest too!""  So there's twice the chin dimple and chest hair action when you see J.L. Picard showing his stuff.  I wonder if this episode was influenced by the First Generation episode ""Patterns of Force"" in which both Kirk and Spock appear shirtless.  In that older episode, Shatner's smooth chest contrasts with Nimoy's hairy chest.  In this newer episode, it's double the chest hair hotness.",1342569600,,1475,4.891129032258065

However, I'm not sure I agree philosophically with the conclusion. I think the notion that ""power corrupts"" bears some truth but is ultimately a tired cliche that they employ a little too simply in this episode. What is considered power is completely relative. Picard instructs Riker that he should not use his power, that he should continue to use only the abilities he had before. However, if the engines of the Enterprise were improved such that it could reach Warp 12, would Picard refuse to use the advanced speed on the principle that it was too powerful? I also don't believe Riker behaved in character... his reactions to being asked not to use his power aren't consistent with how he normally acts. I also don't really think that having the rest of the crew reject his ""gifts"" leads to a conclusion that he should abandon his powers. I think, like everything in life, he should have used it as a learning experience, that to have such powers doesn't mean the people around you are willing to have their lives changed even if you think you are helping them. My problem with the way this story resolved is that there actually never were any negative repercussions from any of the times he used his powers, making giving them up a pretty silly decision.

Of course, for story purposes Riker couldn't keep his powers. I think a far better resolution would have been for him to have given in and resurrected the girl that died. And then to go on reviving the life of everyone they encounter who dies, only to realize that he has to alter reality more and more to do so, and that it has unintended consequences for other people he is not aware of. After finding out how his well-intentioned actions cause unintended harm he had not been aware of, he would swear off ever using such powers again, spoiling the plans of Q.

698066,5,6303574289,"Dear ""Diappointed by Blu-Ray TNG""

Paramount ARE releasing TNG in its original screen aspect ratio - there is no more picture to see left and right, what you are seeing is the entire 35mm frame as it was originally photographed.

You said - ""I understand that directors of the show at the time were short-sighted and often neglected the left and right side of the frame that falls outside of the 4:3 box, but the truth is that the film still contains this information."" That's incorrect, the film contains no more information than what you will see on the BluRay. Programs at that time were filmed with the 4:3 aspect ratio in mind and so they were able to use the entire 35mm frame.

The only way to see this in 16:9 would be to crop the picture top and bottom and the show just wasn't framed that way. It would also be a horrible compromise. I hope you appreciate that Paramount have taken the best option, you can always zoom the image yourself if you don't like the black bars left and right.",1338681600,21,996,4.4021739130434785

698069,5,6303574289,"I would think that in most cases, thats not to say all. The portions of film outside of the 4:3 ratio probably spill outside of the set pieces and, would also show production crew, alternate camera's, and other production equipment that would be very difficult and expensive to filter or rotoscope out of the picture. Then what would you replace it with, and how would you do it w/o zooming and cropping (hence distorting and stretching) the picture.

Personally I'm glad that the CBS chose to keep the original aspect ratio. This is what was intended by the directors of the time. Also I think we all should thank our lucky stars that we have CBS and the Okuda's protecting this wonderderful franchise of shows, not only for us, but for future generations as well.",1338249600,8,765,4.666666666666667

698071,1,6303574289,"Dear Paramount Studios Executives,

I am EXTREMELY disappointed in your flawed decision to release the highly anticipated TV show ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" on Blu-Ray format with the inferior screen dimensions of 4:3 Full Frame (1.33:1). There was a clear opportunity to restore the series to the proper and modern TV dimensions of 16:9 Widescreen (1.78:1), but instead you chose the cheap way out by forcing consumers to continue to be stuck with worthless square pictures.

I understand that directors of the show at the time were short-sighted and often neglected the left and right side of the frame that falls outside of the 4:3 box, but the truth is that the film still contains this information. As fans of the show we are being denied the full picture by your insistence to continue to gives us a cut up square. I understand the argument that 4:3 was the standard in the 80s - 90s when the show was broadcast, but that does not change the fact the 4:3 is inherently flawed and unacceptable. Even when I had a 4:3 TV in the 90s I ONLY bought films on VHS & DVD if the aspect was in widescreen. The truth is that the inferior 4:3 version of this show is already available on DVD. Why bother with a shinier 4:3 version at all, especially with such a steep price tag?

This is an utter failure by your company to seize on an opportunity to restore one of your studio's premier properties. 4:3 is ugly and faulty and denies the viewer the whole picture. It would have cost you little to scan the whole image on the film and clean up the few stray objects that were visible in the 16:9 picture. Instead you chose to give consumers the same faulty picture they have had for years. This is utterly useless and a waste of everyone's time.

I was all set to happily shell out $130 a season for a total of $910 to your company, but I will NEVER pay one dime for 4:3 versions on Blu-Ray. By choosing to leave the show in 4:3 you have lost a potential loyal customer who would have enthusiastically paid full price for a quality product. My only hope is that others stay away from these 4:3 monstrosities and that your company realizes that the only acceptable way to release TV shows on Blu-Ray is with the dimensions of 16:9 Widescreen (1.78:1).

If you decide to release the show at a later date in 16:9 I will happily purchase it. Otherwise you have lost a big sale. Perhaps when you release all 7 seasons in a box set you will reconsider you decision. I can only hope this is the case.",1338249600,24,2492,4.420479302832244
698072,5,6303574289,"I definitely look forward to receiving it.  Expensive but worth every penny because the quality shown in the preview sampler was outstanding.  I guess the only drawback is that we'll now have to wait so long for them to remaster all the seasons, even though we know there is an unprecedented amount of work involved. But here's to hoping that things goes well for them on the remastering front. And I certainly hope Star Trek Voyager (my all-time favorite series) and all other series (Deep Space 9) gets the exact same treatment...",1338076800,3,532,4.771739130434782
698073,5,6303574289,"I have been waiting for a high-definition version of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' (and its successors) since I first upgraded my home system to include a high-definition TV and Blu-ray.  I decided against purchasing the DVD boxed sets of TNG years ago because I could never catch them on sale; their initial purchase price was well over $100 per season set, just like the actual list price for the Blu-ray.  Luckily Amazon is awesome and I got my Blu-ray set for $59.99.  My only real gripe with was the shipping experience; I only paid for the 3-5 day shipping (which is technically less than $3.00), but I could have chosen free shipping and received it faster.  Everything else I've ever ordered through Amazon I've chosen free shipping and had the product within two to three business days.  This order actually took the full five business days.  I know the rating system is supposed to grade Amazon as well as the product itself, but considering how minor this gripe is it would be unfair to knock anything off the rating.  My only suggestion would be, if you're used to ordering using the free 5-8 business day shipping, don't bother paying for shipping unless you're going to choose overnight or two-day.  The 3-5 business day shipping wasn't any faster in my experience.

As for the product itself, I am so far beyond impressed.  I will first address the audio issues that have appeared in other reviews; there is a replacement program out there (it was advertised on this page here on Amazon but isn't any longer; I assume this means that all existing inventory has been replaced).  If have already ordered my replacement discs which will be available beginning August 10th.  The process is painless and did not impact my view of the product.  It is still a superior version of ST:TNG.  The picture is incredible; yes there have been some gripes about the picture not being in widescreen (16:9) as it's in it's original 4:3 format.  This is the way television was shot back then, and while they have upgraded the existing picture to true high definition it would degrade the quality to convert it to widescreen format.  The video is so cleaned up, so pure and so amazing it truly looks like it was filmed today.  Obviously with dated costumes, hair styles, language, etc you can tell it's old but the visual transformation is truly spectacular.

The extras on the set are pretty incredible. Brand new interviews with the Next Generation cast and crew were filmed and will be featured on every season set.  There are 90 minutes of new interviews and documentary footage exclusive to the Season One Blu-rays.  You get some cast interviews, interviews with Mike and Denise Okuda (if you're a trekkie you know who they are, long-ago filmed and updated interviews with those responsible for the creation of TNG, including Paramount, Rick Berman, Gene Roddenberry and his son, and a few people who worked on the technical restoration of TNG to Blu-ray.  Those 95 minutes are divided up into two parts.  The first is ""Energized: Taking the Next Generation to the Next Level (HD),"" which appears on Disc 1 and ""Stardate Revisited: The Origin of Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" which appears on Disc 6.  You also get all of the DVD Featurettes which appeared on the original DVD releases (I'm assuming this will be true with each season release), and as a special bonus each disc has the original Television Episodic Promos.  They're a little dated and some of them make you laugh, but they're fun to watch.  Watching them makes you realize how much television has changed over the last quarter-century.

The very beginning of Disc 1 has a tantalizing preview of the Second Season Blu-ray set.  I'm assuming since they're already showing the preview that it's complete and waiting in the wings.  There's a rumored extended version of the brilliant episode ""Measure of a Man,"" in which Data's humanity is legally challenged.  Apparently the lost footage (a whole twelve minutes!!!) has been located and restored and put back in the episode, so perhaps that will be the beginning of some of the series' most important episodes getting the 'extended' treatment.

Back to Season One ... there really isn't anything new I can say about the episodic content itself.  Every Star Trek fan knows the first season of TNG was the weakest and had the least consistency.  Many episodes originally aired out of order, which causes some storyline inconsistency.  Many characters suffer storyline development - most notably Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Lt. Yar (Denise Crosby), both of whom were gone when Season Two premiered.  Luckily McFadden was back full time when Season Three premiered and Crosby returned for several notable episodes.  Despite the many weak moments in Season One, it still has several strong moments as well.  Some of my favorite Season One moments include ""The Naked Now,"" ""Hide and Q,"" ""Datalore,"" ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" ""Heart of Glory,"" ""Haven,"" ""Conspiracy"" and ""The Neutral Zone.""

The packaging itself is compact compared to its DVD predecessor.  Expanded Blu-ray cases comprised of six discs and a slim cardboard cover of the cover art itself are what's offered.  I like this as it takes up less shelf-space, but a booklet inside the Blu-ray case with episodic listings (you have to remove the first disc to see the episode listing) and some never-before seen photos would have rounded out an already amazing set.

This is absolutely worth the purchase.  You won't be disappointed!

**** My review is dated May 27th because I reviewed the news release for the content prior to the actual product release ... a mistake I will not repeat.  What you see here is actual review of the actual product post-release.",1338076800,2,5737,4.883264462809917

698138,4,6303574289,"I had bought the Sampler pack in advance, and know what to expect in terms of Blu-Ray quality - assuming every piece of footage exists, expect solid sound quality and VERY sharp visuals.  If anything, expect some graininess due to quality of source material, but it's the only nitpick anyone could begin to find.

Color gamut is a VAST improvement over the original DVD set, due to the original film elements being digitally remastered and re-edited from scratch.

Such film re-editing is a lengthy and expensive process, hence the higher price to these releases.  TNG was bleeding edge in 1987 and to edit the f/x on film at the time would have been too costly; hence it was edited together on videotape.  Videotape's limited resolution and narrow color gamut led to a soft look, colors being muted, and reds often appearing more heliotrope (a reddish purple) due to hue shift.  Unfortunately, to do a high-def release, this means every scene had to be re-edited from scratch.  25,000 film canisters have been unearthed and remastered (source - TrekCore) And the results WILL blow you away.  (TrekCore also offers many screencaps and the results are PHENOMENAL).

Some CGI is used, but it's hard to spot and is true to the original f/x.

I will edit this review if what I expect ends up being different and where applicable, but I am focusing more on the stories.

In 1987, it was deemed ""Star Trek"" had to come back to television.  But how to do it?  Set it 100 years in the future and bring in a new cast of actors, add a ready room, keep the captain safe from danger, be allies with the Klingons, give backstories to the characters to exploit, and encounter new worlds.

The show was well-cast, but the writing for the characters was less than stellar.  Many episodes feel trite, corny, or unimaginative (e.g. ""The Naked Now"").  Others have great ideas but are ruined by exceedingly poor execution and over-emphasis on shallow elements (e.g. ""Justice"")  Others have great ideas but are let down by lazy production and dumbing down the adults just to make Wesley look smart (""Datalore"").  And others show where the show could go (""Conspiracy"", ""11001001"".)

The fledgling first season contains the following episodes:

""Encounter at Farpoint"" - double-length episode and pilot.  Q is introduced and threatens humanity. It's a mix of the good and the bad.  Worth watching at least once.  3.5 of 5 stars, mostly because of Q's dialogue early on.

""The Naked Now"" - TOS created ""The Naked Time"" to show how an intoxicating substance brought out character motivations.  The TNG rehash just makes everyone, shall we say, ""frisky and eager to reach out and touch someone"".  1 of 5 stars.

""Code of Honor"" - in true TOS style, Kir... I mean Picard needs to fetch some vaccine for another ailing planet.  The planet they visit, Ligos, has a leader that wants Yar as his primary wife.  The Ligosians live by a strict code of personal honor, even if connive to bend their own rules.  The Data/Geordi scenes in this story are entertaining and the Yar fight scene is good, but the rest of it is one big cliche.  1 of 5 stars.

""The Last Outpost"" - an unknown force freezes the Enterprise's systems, along with the systems of an enemy vessel (the Ferengi species is introduced).  Another TOS-wannabe story and the Ferengi do not get a strong start.  2 of 5 stars

""Where No One Has Gone Before"" - never mind the temporary ""Scotty-wannabe"" of the week, despite lackluster direction and Data using contractions everywhere, this one is fairly decent.  Even Mullet-Man that Picard has to wake up out of a self-induced hallucination is passable.  3 of 5.

""Lonely Among Us"" - a mysterious entity invades the ship and crew while the Enterprise transports two opposing delegations to mediate.  Another TOS-style story, but has some moments of sharp dialogue and works - if you can overlook plot contrivances and oversights.  3 of 5.

""Justice"" - Going to shore leave on a seemingly perfect planet, the crew is unaware of their legal system (break a law and die).  Wesley accidentally trips into a flower garden and is sentenced to death for landing on a bed of pansies.  This episode has much it could have done to be a real standout but ends up being a real piece of tacky, cliched embarrassment.  The Data/Picard and Data/Geordi scenes are compelling, but the rest of the episode seems to prefer ignoring the ""prime directive"" plot in favor of showing people oil themselves up as being the example of this ""perfect planet"".  1 of 5 stars and that's only because of Data and my generosity.

""The Battle"" - Picard's previous vessel is returned by the Ferengi and a trap within is set by the Ferengi commander as form of revenge.  This is actually a good story that also gives the Ferengi some justice.  The problem is, how come it takes everyone so long to find the device manipulating Picard?  Still, it's a tightly-written and engaging adventure.  3.5 of 5.

""Hide and Q"" - Q returns and cajoles Riker with being given the power of the Q.  The ending is trite, but is a fairly sturdy runaround, despite the attempt at the ""penalty box"" scene failing.  3 of 5

""Haven"" - Troi's mother arrives and Troi is surprised over the announcement of arranged marriage.  1 of 5.

""The Big Goodbye"" - Picard makes use of the holodeck and it malfunctions while his program (a 1940s detective scenario) is running.  This is another solid entry, for season 1's standards.  3 of 5.

""Datalore"" - the crew arrive at Data's home planet and discover another android...  Wesley gets smart because all the adults are dumbed down (only Wesley suspects and he sits there while Lore (as Data) uses contractions!).  Worse, Data as Data uses contractions (where's the director to do a re-take??).  The crystalline entity, as with Lore, is an interesting creation (of which the CGI for the Blu-Ray release (source - TrekCore) looks FANTASTIC) and both make return appearances later in the series' run.  Despite its shortcomings (and there are many), this gets 4 of 5.

""Angel One"" - another eye-candy episode with no substance and cliche gender role reassignments.  Riker gets busy.  And big 80s hair.  That sums it up.  Sadly.  1 of 5.

""11001001"" - the Enterprise is getting its holodeck fixed and the technicians are covertly planning on stealing the ship.  The holodeck is reprogrammed to be more alluring and, go figure, Riker takes the bait in the form of slinky Minuet.  Only one line dares wreck the episode (Minuet states Picard being around is a fortunate happenstance.  Note how the Binars always work in pairs, so why trap only one person (Riker)?  Still, apart from the corny ""let's all smile"" scene at the start, this one deserves 5 of 5.  It's a must-see.

""Too Short a Season"" - an old grudge between old enemies exists and the Enterprise must transport a mediator, and the mediator seems to be aging in reverse...  It's half a cliche, and feels like a half-apology for TOS' ""A Private Little War"" given some of the same ideas are discussed, but it's very watchable.  3 of 5 stars.

""When the Bough Breaks"" - an advanced civilization steals Enterprise families' children.  Early in TNG, they wanted families on the ship and to make this a family-friendly show.  ""Bough"" fits the bill and is intelligently written, even if it doesn't fit the TNG mold.  Some great sci-fi concepts (e.g. a race that uses technology but no longer knows how to repair it because the computers are self-sustaining, radiation poisoning, etc) are used...  it's a gem, often overlooked.  4.5 of 5.

""Home Soil"" - terraforming gets a good episode, but half the actors come across uninspired and wooden when their dialogue suggests eagerness and jubilance.  Bad casting of some of the roles (save for Walter Gotell, who puts in a solid performance) waters down what should be another season 1 highlight.  4 of 5.

""Coming of Age"" - Wesley takes a starfleet entrance exam while an admiral investigates a possible issue amongst the ship's senior staff.  This is another good episode, with nothing letting it down.  4 of 5.

""Heart of Glory"" -  The Enterprise rescues some Klingons, who might have a past... okay, I liked the Geordi VISOR scene, but its placement in a rescue mission where time is of the essence (unstable engines that might go BOOM at any minute) seems idiotic.  Still, at this point season 1 is finally putting out a stream of solid stories with a feel vastly different than the juvenile claptrap presented earlier on.  3.75 of 5.

""The Arsenal of Freedom"" - the Enterprise encounters a weapons manufacturing system and is an unwitting test.  As are the away team members that beam down.  While cliche at times, this is another strong episode. 4 of 5.

""Symbiosis"" - two societies on neighboring planets have a great economic deal going - one works for the items needed to trade for needed medications.  Unfortunately, what's going on is drug addiction, with the sellers leeching off the work of their victims.  It's heavy-handed at times, but enjoyable nonetheless.  4 of 5.

""Skin of Evil"" - an evil entity takes Troi's shuttle hostage and kills one of the away team to demonstrate its power.  The premise is good, but the execution (pun not intended) his horrendous, and how does the dead crewmember decide to make a recording (with Windows XP wallpaper in the background) for all of her crewmembers that she thinks may never transfer to other ships (but seemed posthumously right in her belief!)  Despite some nice horror bits, it ends up being underwhelming.  3 of 5.

""We'll Always Have Paris"" - Picard meets an old fling and a scientist's dimensional experiments are going awry.  2 of 5.

""Conspiracy"" - following up from a previous episode, an alien species is invading.  Picard goes to Earth at the behest of a friend.  This is a rock-solid episode, even if the ending is a trifle cliche.  It needed a follow-up, which we never got.  5 of 5 stars.

""The Neutral Zone"" - While Picard is elsewhere and with Riker in command, Data finds a cryogenic ship containing some humans from the late 20th century/early 21st.  Riker wants to let them all die whereas Data wants to revive them to study for historical purposes.  But an old enemy appears at the end, about why their outposts have been gutted...  This one is oddly entertaining, even if it was deemed dumb in 1988.  The ""fish out of water"" trope never hurts, and the choice of personalities to use is interesting.  As is the scene where Troi points out to the woman her family tree and ""Who"" makes it (six times, in fact...)  Some of Picard's dialogue is questionable, but is made up with his succinct delivery of humanity in the 24th century: ""to improve yourself. To enrich yourself. Enjoy it!""  3.5 of 5 stars.

This set, yes - season 1, is definitely worth the money, even if the costs had to go up due to the amount of work applied.  The people doing the editing and to make the episodes' editing identical to the original releases need to be commended.  I'll happily pay for their efforts.

698170,4,6303574289,"Most of the episodes in the first season are interesting to watch from the perspective as how far the show and characters had evolved over seven seasons.  It took almost the entire first season for the characters to find themselves and for the writers to iron out all the kinks to create what we normally perceive as their personalities.  This includes the character Data as well.  In the first few episodes Data varied from having too much emotion to acting like a computer on the ship.  It took awhile to find that right balance.  This episode gave a lot of background into the creation of Data while also helping to define his character.  Plus giving the actor Brent Spiner an opportunity to portray ""the evil data""

This episode also includes one of the rare major TNG bloopers that could probably only appear in the first season.  Much was made of the fact that Data could not use contractions while his brother Lore could.  Lore could say ""Couldn't or Didn't"" while Data could only say ""Could not or Did not"".  Yet at the end of the episode, while there was still some confusion as to whether Data was really himself or Lore pretending to be Data, the captain asked him if he was alright.  In which Data replied (with Lore's twitch) ""I'm fine"".  Now if you were the captain, wouldn't you have immediately suspected something?  Not only did Data have Lore's unexplained twitch, but he used a contraction!  But Captain Picard just told Data to ""get rid of the twitch"" and strolled out the door with no further questions asked.  BIG BLOOPER!

Otherwise, one of the better episodes from the first season.",1332892800,,1606,4.661921708185053

TNG is one of the greatest works of television, but this copy on Amazon Prime needs to be fixed.  I guess I shouldn't complain since all the free Star Trek is just a nice bonus on top of my two-day shipping, but if you are going to do something, do it right!

Because honestly - and as a Star Trek fan, this kind of hurts to say - the first two seasons of ""TNG"" aren't especially good. In fact I've always found the first season rather hard to watch. The bulk of the scripts here are very weak, and the camerawork, the sets, and the costumes have dated badly. Added to those problems is the fact that the acting here - even by Stewart - is a bit dodgy. My gut feeling is that the actors just hadn't drawn a bead on their characters yet.

698339,5,6303574289,"The decision to re-create the much loved Star Trek series with a new cast, and set far in the future from the original show, was indeed a courageous one. Even the original cast had some resistance to the idea. The powers behind TNG worked hard to tie their new endeavor to the original show. Dr. McCoy makes a cameo in the pilot, and an early episode, ""The Naked Now"", put the TNG crew at risk of the same circumstances that almost destroyed the Enterprise in ""The Naked Time"".

However, it turned out that the casting had been inspired. The energy and boldness of Kirk was largely embodied in the First Officer, Riker. The Captain, Picard, was presented as an older and more settled officer. When I saw the previews and was introduced in them to an android named ""Data"", I rolled my eyes. Brent Spiner was brilliant in the role and immediately won not only me, but all fans over. Then there was the presence of the precocious child prodigy ... another eye roll. Yet Wesley Crusher worked on screen, and once again the character building and casting of the producers and writers was proved out. The three female leads are beautiful women, and were strong characters. The inclusion of a Klingon, Worf, was a decision that paid off in great stories and viewer enjoyment for 11 years plus a few movies. Early on, the Enterprise went through a musical chairs set of Chief Engineers. Finally Geordy LaForge, a blind officer with a special visor to allow a form of sight, was set in the spot and stayed there to the end of the Next Gen movies. Levar Burton was superb, as were all his castmates.

There was a bit of awkwardness for part of this season, but the cast quickly found their footing and made this series into ""Real Star Trek"". In fact, they drew many new fans who weren't all that familiar with the original series of the 60s, and many liked Picard's version of a starship caption more than Kirk's (not me, I watched the first Star Trek shown in 1966 and am faithful ;-) ).

This DVD set is well done. The episodes look great, and the extras are interesting. Let's face it, you already know whether you like this series or not. Episodes have been pretty much continually broadcast in either first run or rerun since the night it premiered. If you like Next Gen,  you'll like this DVD set.

It contains all the episodes plus some extras on the last disk such as development, episode ideas, cast comments, and many other things.

The complete first series dvd box is compact and tight easily fitting in any DVD case with similiar products. I did
have a slight problem with the layout of the first season box. Its a dual foldout box, strangely designed and not
that sturdy. It holds the dvd's in with the basic plastic center plug (its not a sleave box) and they are tight and secure. The design of the dual foldout box makes simply picking a episode dvd annoying. Instead of just opening the
box and picking your dvd, you have to unfold it all the way first then pick it, then fold it back. Bad design.

But overall who cares about the box. The episodes are great, the show is great, and the quality of the episodes were great.

As a last note, when you want to buy the seasons or complete seasons of Star Trek TNG, make sure to do your homework with pricing. Many times the individual seasons are cheaper than the complete set, and sometimes they are not.

698347,1,6303574289,"I was originally going to do a general review of the whole series.  This series was amazing.  I loved it.  But then I realized something.  The first two seasons suck!  Especially the first season.  It was like they tapped into the worst parts of the original series.  When I say I loved the show, I mean the bulk of it, season three through seven.  Those were awesome.  But this season?  I cannot believe they were able to continue the series after this piece of garbage. The first episode, Encounter at Farpoint, is probably the worst pilot episode of any televison show I've ever seen.  And I mean worse than the pilot episode of Voyager or TOS.  There was just nothing in that episode that I didn't hate with a fiery passion.  I couldn't stand any of the characters, I thought the bad guys were campy at best, and I thought the plot was as bad as any of the worst episodes of TOS.  I don't know how this pilot was picked up by CBS and turned into a long-running series.  I am, however, glad they did.

Let's go into some of the characters.  I couldn't stand Picard.  He was such a jerk in the first two seasons.  It's not until season three that he starts to develop into the kind but strict character that he was famous for.  He's not kind but strict here.  He's just an overbearing jackass.  Refusing to listen to Wesley's warnings about Lore in the episode Datalore, telling Riker he should not have tried to save a young girl's life in Hide and Q, and generally treating his crew with contempt for this season and the season following it.  I didn't really like Riker either.  But with Picard, I went from hating him at the beginning of the series to him becoming my favorite character and probably my favorite Starfleet captain.  I never really liked Riker at all.  I went from hating him to thinking he was okay, kind of like Anya in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Riker has a stick up his butt for most of the series.  He's just way too arrogant and cocky.  It would have been okay if he's started out like that and gradually become more mature at the end of the series.  But he doesn't.  The only time I liked him at all was in the film, First Contact.  He's at his worst in this season.  Data is really the only character I liked from the beginning.  He's kind of the anti-Spock.  Wheras Spock, who is half-human and half-vulcan, tries to lean away from his huan side, Data endeavors to become more human.  Worf...eh...I thought he was okay.  Some people love him, some hate him.  I choose a sort of middle ground when it comes to Worf.  I liked his character, his backgroud, and the situations and plot twists his character encounters.  But throughout the whole series, I cringed whenever he gave an acting performance.  Michael Dorn just could not make this character interesting.  In this season, we are given some background information on Worf, in the episode Heart of Glory.  Other than that, Worf is not touched on much.  Although he does give some very over-the-top performances here, like in Encounter at Farpoint and Hide and Q (what a horrible name for a horrible episode).  Geordi is another character that I liked, but I just couldn't stand him in this season.  He gets better with time, but he really over-acted in this season.  Beverly Crusher is the only character, other than Data, that I liked throughout the entire series.  Her character was good, her performance was good, and she was a great semi-love-interest for Picard.  The only thing I didn't like about her was the fact that she mothered Wesley, one of the only two characters I hated with a flaming passion.  I couldn't stand him.  He was so whiny and annoying.  I know Wesley is a subject of hatred for many Trek fans, and I can't say anything about him that hasn't been said thousands of times already.  I also hated Deanna Troi.  She existed to to one thing.  Fill out her skin-tight uniforms.  And to cry and whine whenever she has a painful vision.  They kind of cut down on that as the series went on.  But in this season, she is just unbearable.

The plotlines in this seasons were unbelievably retarded.  Episodes like Encounter at Farpoint, Code of Honor, Justice, Angel One, and the Neutral Zone were just so silly, cheesy, and in some cases racist.  When I say that, I'm referring to the two different types of cultures encountered in Code of Honor and Justice.  When it comes to episodes like Hide and Q, it was like they plugged into the stupidest parts of the original series, like when Kirk teamed up with Abraham Lincoln.  This season was just horrible, due to it's boring and annoying characters, and it's ridiculous plots.",1261180800,13,4625,4.5242130750605325
698436,4,6303574289,"Much has been said about this season, so I'll keep my review fairly short. I didn't start watching this show right away when it was first on TV, so I'm not sure how long it took for audiences to get used to the characters. Viewed from the perspective of having seen later seasons, all the pieces are there and the characters seem like old friends. In spite of all the little things one could say, I think there are only really two somewhat large drawbacks to the first season. The first is that many of the off-ship scenes seem very cheesy. The sets are very fake looking and some of the action portrayed on other planets seems tacky. The second issue is that almost every one of the episodes seem to loose steam at the end. Many of them start out with interesting premises and it seems like a lot of effort went into the buildup but then they sort of get resolved quickly at the end, often in an anticlimactic or confusing manner. It's almost as if all the effort was put into the first 80 percent of the episode and the end was just tacked on as an afterthought.

Aside from these issues, the first season is definitely watchable and worth checking out, especially if you are like me and have seen many episodes from the later seasons but not the first.",1256256000,4,1255,4.363247863247863

Secondly, the acting in this season is atrocious(save Brent Spiner), they all seemed so one-dimensional, and over-reacted to situations that didn't need it.

Thirdly, the uniforms, they just look...bland, plain, boring, but also they do not fit(not literally) you know what I mean, and Riker...you need a beard!

Last but not least, the special effects in this season are horrible, they look so cheaply done, the planets look AWFUL!

Well, enough putting this season down, but it deserves it, this series would really take shape from season 3 on, but season 2 showed alot of promise, I would say, if you want to get into The Next Generation, just skip this season and go right to season 2, although not as good as season 3 on, still solid, has some great episodes, Riker has a beard in it, let's face it, he needs the beard, he looks like a kid without it, and on the second season, the writers and actors start to get their act(no pun intended)together, although no Dr. Crusher, who would later return in season 3, and stay aboard (yay!), although I didn't mind Pulowski, but Dr. Crusher is much better.

Yawn.

Gene Roddenberry's idealistic vision of the future may be admirable, but does it make good entertainment? Based on my viewing of this first season, hardly. Roddenberry and his crew clearly want us to be moved by less-than-subtle appeals to abandon the transgressions of our own time, and unite in creating the world of the Federation. But what could have been a postmodern metanarrative of human evolution comes across more often as saccharine and trite, an after school special dressed in sci-fi garb. Cringe-inducing dialogue about the dangers of doing drugs (""Symbiosis"") and the evils of capitalism (""The Neutral Zone"") don't help. And while the lead performances, especially from the classically trained Patrick Stewart, are quite solid, there are some truly abysmal moments from less talented guest actors.

To be fair, the show gets better in subsequent seasons. But in this era of highly charged realist programs like Battlestar Galactica, this first season of Star Trek:TNG is as feckless as a soap opera in space.",1244073600,5,1154,5.227027027027027

  -- Commander Riker to LaForge and Data, ""1001001""

If you're already familiar with Star Trek: The Next Generation, then you may be surprised to see how short the first season falls from what you've come to expect.  While most of the hit television series of today start strong and struggle to maintain their momentum across seasons, TNG undergoes a slow and often awkward maturation process in which it takes many seasons for the show to reach its apex.  The production values are uneven, the characterization and writing often feel forced and unnatural, and even aspects of the general premise seem shaky at times.  However, if you're new to the series or are able to divorce yourself from any preconceived expectations of what a TNG episode should look like, then Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 1 has a lot to offer.

I would be hesitant to judge this season by its first episodes.  In fact, I consider the first three (""Encounter at Farpoint,"" ""The Naked Now,"" and ""Code of Honor"") to be utterly unwatchable.  However, by the middle of the season, the show begins to hit a stride.  The writers and actors begin to understand the characters better, production elements become stronger, we start to get into some pretty interesting science fiction premises, and, believe it or not, even Wesley becomes somewhat likable.  TNG begins to achieve what it originally promised -- a continuation of the legacy established by Shatner, Nimoy, and the gang twenty years earlier.  Some of the stronger episodes from this latter half of the season include ""1001001,"" ""Too Short A Season,"" ""Home Soil,"" ""Coming of Age,"" ""Symbiosis,"" ""We'll Always Have Paris,"" and ""The Neutral Zone.""

However (and best yet), there are several glimpses of something better in this season.  Several times, the show steps dangerously close to becoming something greater than its predecessor.  IN ""1001001,"" for example, we're afforded an opportunity to see the crew on leave, and characterization begins to come through in a rich, genuine, and loving way that surpasses anything I've ever felt for the crew of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Original-Series/dp/B000VDDDY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Original Series</a>.  Better yet, small hints of inter-episode continuity surface from time to time, whether it be repeated references to the holodeck upgrade (before, during, and after its occurance), Romulan hostility near the neutral zone, or (most predominantly featured by the season's ending) hints of a conspiracy within Starfleet.  Several of these continuity references appear out of order within the season (perhaps due to rushed production schedules), and I do take issue with the fact that there was no attempt to restructure the order of episodes to account for this on the DVDs, but I still respect such an ambitious attempt to show that individual episodes and adventures no longer occur within a vacuum.  They are all intertwined in one planned continuity.

Regarding the technical details of the DVDs, while the audio tracks have been upgraded (Dolby Digital 5.1, I believe) to deliver some superior sound quality, little or nothing has been done to improve the picture.  The earliest episodes, in particular, suffer from very inconsistent quality.  Ghost matting is often present around ships and effects, there's some graininess, and most episodes throughout the season look very dark.  None of this has been corrected.  A&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remastered-Blu-Ray-version-of-the-Original-Series/dp/B001TH16DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remastered Blu-Ray version of the Original Series</a>&nbsp;has recently been made available and, in the wake of the upcoming Star Trek movie, I would expect to see a similar treatment given to Next Gen.  If you have or are planning on getting a Blu-Ray player, this may not be the time to buy the TNG Seasons.  And, of course, if you're happy with Standard DVD, you might wait to see if the price on these seasons drops to rock bottom once the remastered Blu-Ray editions are made available.

In closing, while this is certainly not TNG at its finest, it absolutely brings its own strengths to the table.  It also features a few important moments in TNG continuity, from the first two appearances of Q (""Encounter at Farpoint,"" ""Hide and Q""), to the first appearance of Lore (""Datalore"") and Luwaxana Troi (""Haven""), the death of Tasha Yar (""Skin of Evil""), and finally the first contact with the Romulans in decades (""The Neutral Zone"").  For these reasons, TNG Season One is worth a viewing so long as you're willing to adjust your expectations.  The only question is whether you're ready to start the adventure now or wait for the Blu-Ray remastered edition.",1237593600,6,4903,5.371241830065359

698527,3,6303574289,"For any fan of the original series. the first season appears to be a bad disappointment.  Picard is austere, analytical and not all that sensual, and stiff when compared to the flawed and impetuous Kirk.  The stories also appear rather derivative, right down to the plots.  When I first saw the pilot, it was enough to put me off for 2 full years:  I thought that it would not work and dismissed it.  (I was also in graduate school, which eliminated the possibility of regular leisure.)

It was not until the 3rd season that I gave it another try, when the characters were established and the far more mature character  of the show was evident - less military, more culturally sensitive and diplomatic, with the addition of full families on board.  Indeed, it was only when I came across it by chance, while starting a career and in need of a break, that I saw the incredible quality that had emerged.  All the characters, beyond the absolutely first rate Patrick Stewart, had evolved and cohered into a believable team.  That being said, while my wife and daughter are watching this season again, for the most part I feel no desire to sit with them, but can listen from my perch at the computer (i.e. right now).

So I think that season 1 is only of interest as a precursor to what ultimately matured into a better series than the original.  It is for that I recommend this warmly.",1233964800,,1382,4.528225806451613

698659,2,6303574289,"Watching many of these episodes, it is amazing (and fortunate) that the show lasted beyond one season.  While only a few of the episodes fall into the flat-out terrible category, most of them are extremely ho-hum and only a minority would rank as even average in comparison to the standard set in later seasons.  The show comes up short in nearly every category - bad acting, lame stories, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, corny music, excessive preachiness and comically bad special effects.  In many of the episodes, any actual appeal comes simply from laughing at the hilarious B-movie (or C-movie!) cheesiness of it all.

TNG was not an arc-based show at this point, and most viewers not obsessed with completeness can safely skip ahead to later seasons.  There are several episodes that I would characterize as worth watching - ""Justice"" (because it is so hilariously awful), ""Conspiracy"" (the best of the season), ""Datalore"", ""Heart of Glory"", ""The Arsenal of Freedom"", ""Encounter at Farpoint"" (primarily for the second half, though the first 45 minutes provide plenty of unintentional laughs) - and a handful of others that are decent.

The show would improve quite a bit in the (much-maligned) second season and really hit its stride in season 3.  Unless you are a completist or really big on nostalgia, the premiere season can be skipped.",1211068800,4,1357,5.085585585585585
698660,3,6303574289,"I was surprised to see that as of this writing, 161 people have given STNG's inaugural season either four or five stars. I respectfully suggest that some people are grading on a curve, allowing their overall affection for a great show to blind them to the first season's many failings. At best, I think Season 1 staked along the edge of pretty good, and I don't think it can be taken as Trek-bashing to point out that fact.

Like all new shows, STNG had a lot of teething troubles, as well as problems escaping the shadow of the original series. Some of its flaws:

1. Ill-defined characters. Deanna Troi has nothing to do except fret about her terrible haircut and occasionally state the obvious via painfully dumb dialogue. Data is written as if he has never been around humans before and is baffled by virtually every non-literal expression they use, a device which quickly becomes annoying. Riker comes off as pretentious and silly. Worf seems to be partially feral. And Wesley...don't get me started on frickin' Wesley.

2.  No, on second thought, let me start. This character was a failure from second one, almost unbelievably annoying. He dragged every scene he was in into a kind of cringing, sugary, cutsey land of sickly-sweetness, and there were times when he made me long for the ultimate destruction of all life on the ship. The writers seemed to have no clue whatsoever of how a real 15 year old kid acts, and made him a kind of sexless, overachieving Beaver Cleaver I kept wishing would stumble into an airlock.

3.  Did I mention the dialogue? Although the writers occasionally show flashes of the brilliance that marked later seasons (such as when Admiral McCoy tells Data, appropos the Enterprise, ""You treat her like a lady, and she'll always take you home"") it's frequently terrible and sometimes embarrassing, not to mention self-righteous. Bad dialogue makes for bad acting, and many good actors gave ham-fisted, scene-chewing performances as a result.

4.  Most of the devices used to differentiate new Trek from old turned out to be clunkers which were swiftly shunted to the background, such as the ability of the ship to separate in battle, the presence of families on board, or the introduction of the Ferengi as the series' staple villains, which flopped so completely they were soon changed to comic-relief role.

5.  The planetary sets, which later became extraordinarily realistic, were horribly fake.

6.  The stories. Many are lame, and some are terrible. It also annoyed me that when they ripped off a classic Trek episode, they always acted as if what they were encountering had never happened before.

Of course, all of these problems were eventually resolved, and by mid-season the show was showing signs of real maturity. ""Hearts of Glory"", ""The Arsenal of Freedom"" and ""Conspiracy"" are all pretty good examples of STNG starting to slough off its difficulties and stand up straight, and ""Too Short A Season"" was nearly brilliant, but I really don't think STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION assumed five star status until its third season.",1210550400,6,3071,4.905405405405405
698661,4,6303574289,"This is where Star Trek really begins for me.  I know. I know.  I'm not the most die hard fan, but I got into this series enough to get the novels, comics and DVD's.  I also realize this has been reviewed a million times, and maybe my retrospective review really won't capture the full breadth of this seasons airing in the late 1980's, but I'll try to do it justice.  Some people might disagree with my perceptions considering my point of view is based on having seen all the other seasons.

In comparison to what is now considered Classic Trek, I can assume that many people had some misgivings or were worried about the prospect of a new series under the Star Trek name.  I know I did when The Next Generation ended and Deep Space Nine was created.  However, The Next Generation launches us hundreds of years into the future from where Classic Trek started us off.  Maybe I got into this one a lot more because the technological differences available to the creators are so vastly different.  I'm not saying the original Star Trek didn't have any merit, it sure did in the era it was made, but being a child born in the early 1980's I've been spoiled with an ever increasing world of technology, so the design on The Next Generation is a huge difference for me.  However, the technological increase between the shows should be an expectation of viewers!

Being a first season this isn't a hundred percent perfect, but it is very good regardless.  You can see a rather noticeable difference between the pilot episode and the others, even in terms of writing and characters in some senses.  It's funny because the pilot absolutely screams 1980's, but after that things take a shift.  For example, the most noticeable is Deanna Troi, because in the pilot she's wearing a skirt and has big poofy hair, then for the rest of the season that abruptly changes.  She has on a more normalized kind of uniform and has her hair done tight behind her.  This isn't a complaint; this is just showing how they shifted her character, frankly the change made her seem much more professional and more a part of a Starship rooted in military concepts and training.

However, the writing has taken a bit of a shift from what I've read about the earlier Star Trek series.  The Enterprise 1701-D is primarily an exploration vessel to seek out new life and new areas of the universe... ""to go where no one has gone before"" et cetera, et cetera.  It brings us through all kinds of radiant adventures and very well thought out stories.  A lot of episodes mirror social problems or stigma's 20th century Earth is sort of facing at the time, but a lot of times the episodes are just very good adventures.  One other part that I really enjoyed is because the way a lot of the episodes are written they have more than just a single problem to solve or only one thing going on.  Instead you gain insight into the realistic fact that this is a Starship with a compliment of over a thousand people.  Everyone will have problems of their own to solve and sometimes run into the main characters.  It really pulls the viewers in because you usually have an external problem where the ship faces some unknown in the universe, but there's also an internal problem on the ship that people also have to solve.  This doesn't happen in every episode, but I noticed it is a very common element to the way The Next Generation is written.  Frankly, I like the style because it adds a bit more mystery to the whole series.

I think the bridge crew they chose to have represent the Enterprise is absolutely perfect.  I don't think they could have chosen a better Captain Picard than Patrick Stewart, I always think he's an excellent actor.  My other favorite character is played by Brent Spiner as Lieutenant-Commander Data who gives us a very convincing performance as an android.  Those are probably my two favorites; however, I also like Dr. Crusher, Commander Riker and Lieutenant Yar's character a lot too.  I don't think they had Commander Worf or Commander La Forge in there enough to really get to know those characters, but I get the sense they'll be building on them a bit more.  Counselor Troi also played a critical role throughout the season as well.  Wesley Crusher made a few appearances as well, and I'll admit at first I thought he seemed almost too annoying, but as the season went on I got used to him.

There were some parts of the show I wasn't big on, like the death of one of the bridge crew, because I thought the way they died was just poorly done.  Though it showed that no one was technically safe in this show and I do like that kind of unknown element.  Regardless I just think it could've been by something more interesting, though I realize the point of that episode was to show people can die for no real reason, like in real life.  That doesn't change my thoughts that it should've been by something at least ""cooler"" or more intimidating.  The other part that I think was happening to fast was that there are episodes where they try to give Commander Riker his own ship to captain and they try to bring Captain Picard into the higher echelons of Starfleet.  I thought this was annoying at times because it felt like it was happening much too soon.  For instance, Commander Riker first reported to the Enterprise in the pilot episode and already they want to make him a Captain partway through this series?  I'm sorry, I'm just getting to know these characters I don't want them to disappear all of a sudden so I can get to know a knew one!  That never happens, but the threat of it was sort of annoying at times.  I can understand this coming up a few seasons in, but in the first season it seemed a bit soon to me.

I think that's enough about the episodes, I'm not going to go in depth about them, because most people have seen The Next Generation and many have done more in depth reviews on this show, so I will content myself with a fairly broad overview.  In terms of a DVD release, I really like this box set.  The show is actually quite long and spans six and a half disc.  Most shows only span six discs in content.  You get about four hours of show per disc (really 45 minutes each), so four episodes each except the first one because the pilot was two hours on television.  The seventh disc has the final two episodes and then bonus material for the remainder half of the disc.  I like the box because I prefer the gatefold structure for some reason, but I will say this box is quite nice and fairly well designed in my opinion.  One misgiving is that sometimes it's kind of hard to slide the gatefold part out of its case, other than that it's pretty well done.

698663,4,6303574289,"I recently ordered all 7 seasons of TNG and started at the beginning. Im not a trekkie, but was an avid fan of this series from the start, and have also seen it many times in reruns over the years. However, hadnt seen any startrek in at least 5 years and had built up a craving for it.

There's something very comfortable and sentimental about watching TNG. It might be part nostalgia, but whatever the reason its a nice feeling to come home from work and watch an episode or two of this show.

The first season (like many first seasons) isn't perfect, and there are some pretty bad episodes, but also some really strong ones as well, and even the weaker episodes are still entertaining in their own way.

Definitely recommended.",1206662400,2,729,4.507575757575758

It was a little stiled but being a star trek fan, I got a lot out of being able to watch the characters develop as well as the entire acting crew begin to gel into the show. Many of these first few episodes harked back to the original Star Trek, which is a smart move on the writer's part. This show dared to follow the wonderful original, and succeeded immensely.

698755,4,6303574289,"I first must state that I am a huge Star Trek fan, having discovered the original series in reruns in the mid 1980's. Having spent millions of dollars, er, maybe hundreds of dollars on Star Trek merchandise and memorabilia over the years, I feel confident in being a little critical of some of the lesser efforts, including Season One of Star Trek: The Next Generation (not to mention the worst casting mistake of all time: Kate Mulgrew, which made Voyager unwatchable for me).

When watching this show brand new in 1987, it was spectacular. Just to have any TV version of Star Trek available was great. I remember my accounting professor claiming the new show was 3000 (yes, 3000) times better than the original series. At the time, he was right.

Having recently screened the Season One DVD set again, and with the hindsight of 20 years since its original airing, it is a little hard to believe the show was renewed for a second season. There are many things to criticize about the first season.

For those of you bent on writing one- and two-star reviews comprised of one or two substance-free sentences, I direct you to the review written by Todd Bovair of Wynantskill, NY. His 2-star review is one of the best and most helpful I've read on Amazon. He hits many of the points which make Season One less than a 5-star season.

At the risk of submitting myself to The Wrath of the Trekker, I will add one more point to Mr. Bovair's review that makes Season One less than 5 stars: Gene Roddenberry. Have you noticed how The Great Bird's overbearing viewpoint intrudes on so many story lines? There's no doubt he had an admirable vision, but there is a point where the vision becomes tiresome. From what I've observed, seen, and read, his signature would have been much more boldly written on this season had others not pulled the reins in just a bit now and then.

But I can't speak too harshly. I still think The Next Generation is a fantastic series overall. Taken as a whole, it is easily a 5-star show for me. However, until the creators got their footing in the second season, it is a great effort, but less than the best.

By all means, go buy a copy of this set, especially at the price of just over 50 dollars as of this writing. They were over 100 dollars per season on initial release, so at 50 dollars it's a bargain.",1186531200,3,2329,4.481132075471698
698756,5,6303574289,"It's hard to believe that ST:TNG premiered on television 20 years ago! It's unbelievable how time flies. TNG relaunched and reinvigorated the Trek franchise spawning 3 other new Trek series as well as 4 feature films. ST:TNG is definitely an American legacy.

Of course, I have started my collection with the first season. Some of the better episodes came in subsequent seasons, but I like to watch the series in chronological order. It's very pleasing to watch the characters grow and their relationships with each other become more complex.

Yes, the first season is VERY corny. There are some episodes and/or scenes where I just roll my eyes at the dialogue and situations. But, the cast and crew were just beginning their discoveries of their characters and places in the Trek universe. Once these factors developed, the show improved tremendously.

The extras on the 7th disc are fantastic and a wonderful nostalgia piece. I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when the pilot episode premiered. It was a big deal amoung my friends and family (my dad was a classic Trek fan before I was even born so I grew up watching reruns with him).

This set, as well as the remianing six seasons, are definitely worth the money. I love revisiting these shows. It's almost like visiting family that you don't get to see too often.",1184198400,,1336,4.770562770562771

I have to admit I hated Wesley Crusher, because I saw him as a ""know it all"", plus his futuristic cosby sweaters and later his rainbow pleated uniform screamed ""dork!"" Watching it now, I don't hate him at all! In fact, I have an endearing sense of ""he is adorable"" coming through. I can respect what it took to be an actor that young, coming off of Stand By Me into a mostly adult cast. The crewmember I ended up hating now, as an adult, was Tasha Yar. She is supposed to be chief of security, yet she is impulsive, and overly emotional! The woman cries all the time, I just wanted worf to back hand her off the bridge. I was so relieved when the ""tar monster"" snuffed her out. The beginning episodes were a bit rough. The planets were similar to Classic star trek, purple green and fake rocks everywhere, but it worked. The story lines were also hard to get into, although anything with ""Q"" in it I love! Of course I still detest Jeordi's Banana Clip, and Deanna Trois Phallic hair, but I still adore this season nevertheless, every show has to find its footing and by the end of it they did.",1183075200,2,1246,4.235294117647059
698758,5,6303574289,"Watching this DVD does bring back happy nostalgiac memories for me;towards the end of September in 1987 my folks allowed me to stay up until 11:00PM (which seemed like eternity then)to watch the premire of Star Trek:The Next Generation. At the time I was fascinated:the huge ship,these new characters,Q-it was such an grand adventure. Seeing ""Encounter At Farpoint"" 20 years later my opinion has improved;it's such a different story from anything done in TOS.It's almost like a feature film. A lot of people will tend to critisize this season for not quite being as secure characterizations. That is present here to a certain degree:in episodes such as ""Code Of Honor"" and ""The Last Outpost"" Captain Picard tends to make a big deal of being French. Another interesting notion about this season is Worf's smugness and strange lack of purpose;until the unfortunate death of Tasha Yar Worf seemed to be an overly aggresive token Klingon. None of that matters to me though because I think the first season of TNG is one of the best and most unique this show ever did. Actually some of the look of this season I prefer the look of this season,especially early on. The lighter colors of the crew quarters lighting and the jumpsuit uniforms (that would extend through the second season),as well as a lot of character exploration. This first season should be re evaluated by fans who once looked at this corney and incomplete at first.

In not too much time, Shelby confirms that the Borg indeed have destroyed the colony and are in the area.

The only troublesome part is Shelby.  She is so ambitious, that she actually says to Cmdr. Riker that he is in her way for a promotion (I mean, this assuming that the Borg doesn't blow them to bits or assimilates them.  I would be far more worried about the Borg than a stupid promotion, especially when battle may be imminent.)  Despite that flaw, which is solved nicely in part 2, the episode is one of (if not the) top 10 TNG episodes.

The specials are also very informative. Getting the actors to comment on the first season years later was great.

It being the first season the actors indeed still have to find their way, in the show, in their character and with each-other. It's great so see how it all began, though. Picard seems a bit more agressive than he was/is later in the show. Deanna's hair is always a treat ;-) And also nice to see that miniskirts are not yet completely banned; the first glimpse we had from the Ferengi (with Armin Shimmerman, who later on plays Quark in DS9); Q, always a lot of fun.

698821,4,6303574289,"Star Trek: The Next Generation would become one of the greatest TV shows of all time over the course of its seven-year run. You'd be hard-pressed to find much of that greatness in the first season, which is alternately cheesy and self-serious. Compared to what the show would turn into by the end, however, the first season's freshness and energy is delightful, and some of the episodes are actually pretty good on their own terms.

For those somehow not familiar with the premise, Star Trek follows a group of human space explorers as they fly from planet to planet, interacting and often clashing with the myriad species that inhabit the galaxy. Humanity has reached a point of near-utopia, when the only threats to harmony generally come from outside the Earth-centered Federation. Following this template (which later Treks would deviate from), The Next Generation is a very optimistic show. Almost every episode ends happily at this point in the series, with Captain Picard and crew offering liberal doses of human goodness to cultures that are saddled in one way or another with problems analogous to our own. Later episodes would take darker, more imaginative turns, but for now The Next Generation is still bright, sunny, and mildly predictable.

The problem with the first season is that it sticks far too closely to the original show. Gene Roddenberry's original vision was to reproduce original Star Trek episodes almost verbatim but with the benefit of 20 years of special effects improvements. Early episodes which stick to this vision, like The Naked Now, are some of the series' worst. Once the show develops its own identity toward the midpoint of the first season, things get much better. It starts moving toward its latter-day identity as a show where minds, not weapons, offer the solutions - in other words, a more interesting series.

Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard is a far more level-headed, risk-averse commander than the original show's Captain Kirk, which sometimes makes for less exciting solutions. At this point, clean-shaven first officer Riker doesn't provide a foil, so what we get are two stiff careerists at the head of the show (later seasons distinguish the commanders). Most of the other characters are ciphers, except for Brent Spiner's android character Data, who is awfully demonstrative for an emotionless robot. Most of the flaws here are just typical first season shakes, which will settle down later.

Highlight episodes include the two-hour pilot, Encounter at Farpoint. Though the characters are undefined and the performances are often sketchy, it serves up one of the finer puzzles of the series. Hide and Q is a cool answer to the original series' Where No Man Has Gone Before, with Riker being tempted by godlike power - plus you get to see the annoying Wesley Crusher bayoneted. Home Soil offers an interesting speculative plot. Skin of Evil has a plot stroke that was extremely audacious at the time and still seems slightly shocking today - the sudden, inglorious death of a main character.

All told, this is one of the unnecessary seasons of The Next Generation. Since most of the plots are just one-off affairs that are never referenced again, you can jump into the show at any point (I recommend the third season). If you want the whole series, the first season is not the worst. Recommended on the strength of the series, but not so much of itself.",1151452800,9,3408,4.982425307557118

698823,4,6303574289,"Star Trek the Next Generation was one of the greatest shows in television history.  But it certainly didn't start off that way....at least in my opinion.  The pilot episode, ""Encounter at Farpoint"" was written by Gene Roddenbury, the creater of both Star Trek series.  That should be a plus...right?

Sadly Roddenbury's left-wing leanings show up more than his brilliant writing skills.  He uses the eposide as a soap box to rant against humanity and anything that is traditionally acceptable.  A marine uniform is referred to as ""a rediculous costume"".  Besides the questionable politics, the episode is just silly.

Fortunately I didn't judge the whole series on that pilot episode and I gave it another chance.  The episodes steadily improved through the first season and Star Trek NG bacame a deeply focused show with strong characters. The story lines were great and showed a lot of deep thinking and imagination.  I enjoy reviewing the individual episodes, but there are too many in the entire first season to discuss.  I will say one of my favorites is ""We'll Always Have Paris"".  I didn't buy the first season first because I thought it was the weakest.  But after you collect the rest of the series......if you can afford it, it is worth the investment.  But I say buy the other seasons first.",1146700800,8,1302,4.885844748858448
698907,2,6303574289,"...The first season made it seem like this series was going to be a bad joke. I remember excitedly waiting for the pilot episode to air (I was in 9th  grade), then after viewing it thinking ""What the $&!* was that garbage?!"".
  What really happened is it took about a season and a half for the actors, the crew, and the WRITERS to find their stride. Growing pains were clearly evident in the first two seasons. Seasons 3 and 4 were absolutely INCREDIBLE, featuring outstanding scripts, perfect performances, and everything that made this series a TV legend. Seasons 5-7 were excellent as well. Taken on a whole, Next Generation is one of the best TV series of all time, and FAR eclipsed its predecessor, Star Trek (which itself was outstanding for its time). However, the first season was atrocious. I know a lot of hardcore Trekkies will be peeved that I dare to say such a sacreligious thing, but here are some of the reasons that this season was a debacle:
1) The writing and acting- The scripts in this season were terrible. Of course, the writers were trying to 'find' the characters, which takes time. However, if you compare they way the characters act in later seasons to the way they act in the first season, its almost as if they are different characters! Picard is nationalistic (France), prone to outbursts, and displays none of the quiet, conflicted self-assurance that would make the character famous. Geordi is almost completely one-dimensional, and Riker is prone to extreme overreactions at odd times (Jonathan Frakes would later get a handle on this). Troi is annoying to say the least, and Data's dialogue is more aimed at establishing his character than working within the stories. Wesley is portrayed so sickenly wide-eyed and innocent (with the whole life journey just starting out schtick) that it ruined the character for most Star Trek fans (and Westley is still the most hated Star Trek character of all time). In addition, many of the worst episodes of the entire series are found right here in season 1. Very juvenile and underdeveloped storylines, utterly terrible dialogue, and the infamous 'planet of the joggers' and 'Yar's pointless death' episodes makes for a pretty bad season. Who would have guessed this series would rapidly improve to perfection?
2) The Ferengi- Need I say more? THESE are the big new villians to rival the Klingons and the Romulans?! Thankfully, the mistake was recognized fairly quickly, and the Ferengi were relegated to their rightful place as comic relief.
3) The costumes and the bridge- OK, this might just be a personal grudge of mine, but I HATED the jumpsuits of the first two seasons. Men do not look good wearing jumpsuits, they just look stupid. Why it took two whole seasons for the wardrobe department to figure this out is beyond me. Once the separate shirts started being used, the uniforms looked GREAT, but the jumpsuits were god-awful looking. And what's with the chaise-lounge bridge chairs? If they reclined any further, they would be beds! A pretty stupid idea, thankfully the bridge was redesigned later.
4) The lighting- Has anyone else noticed how badly lit the first season was? Picard's chrome-dome shines, Geordi's skin shines, the bridge lighting looks extremely harsh, and the soundstage 'outdoor' sets are obviously lit with artificial lighting. These problems would be corrected in season 2, with the series eventually being a model for how to light a set PERFECTLY.

  All in all, Next Generation is a FANTASTIC series, one of my all-time favorites. However, season 1 is far and away the worst season, bordering on embarrassing. Season 2 fared better, and every season after was at the very least EXCELLENT. For completists, this season may be a must-buy, but for casual Star Trek fans, avoid the first season and start with season two.",1146009600,54,3825,4.913312693498452

Picard, the bald, child-hating, strict captain. First Officer William T. Riker, ever the ladies man. Data, that lovable android. Geordi La Forge, the blind engineer (or in this season, Chief Helm Officer). Deanna Troi, the Betazoid counselor. Worf, the warrior Klingon. Wesley Crusher, the know-it-all. And, lastly, Beverly Crusher, the pretty and smart doctor.

Encounter at Farpoint - The plot was a little weak for a pilot episode. **

The Naked Now - A very funny episode. One of the best of the set. ***1/2

Code of Honor - A rather boring episode with an odd plot. *

The Last Outpost - This episode introduces the Ferengi to the Star Trek universe. However, the episode itself isn't that great. *1/2

Where No One Has Gone Before - A great Wesley episode. My second favorite in the set. ****

Lonely Among Us - You know...I can't even remember this episode. ?

Justice - A rather good episode. It had some good points about humans. ***

The Battle - A great Picard episode. ***

Hide and Q - One Q episode a season is good enough. I don't need two. **

Haven - A good Deanna Troi. If you watch this episode and watch Voyager, you will find some discrepencies about Talaxians and VOY. Talaxians don't look like Neelix from VOY, as shown in TNG. ***

The Big Goodbye - The first Dixon Hill episode. Great! ****

Datalore - An EXCELLENT Data episode. ****

Angel One - Another good episode with good points. ***

11001001 - Bleh. *

Too Short A Season - I don't remember it well, but I know that I liked it. ***

When the Bough Breaks - An episode about...children. It was okay. **1/2

Home Soil - A little odd. **1/2

Coming of Age - A great Wesley episode. The ending made me a bit angry, though. ***1/2

Heart of Glory - A decent Worf episode. **

The Arsenal of Freedom - A pretty good Geordi episode. ***

Symbiosis - Bleh... **

Skin of Evil - BEST EPISODE ON THE SET! You will love it. It is rather sad. *************

Season one adheres closely to Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration, as well as exploring the many facets of the human condition within a science fiction context.

At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this time with more characters, more action and more special effects. All of the main characters in the TNG series are in episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  Commander William T. Riker,  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher.  Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing, playing an important function in many episodes. The use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired. Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and the mysterious Q,  `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy' (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG: Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out. Although we can debate about which is the better series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so' just makes our day.",1139616000,9,5723,4.859631147540983
698915,4,6303574289,"The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...

$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)

Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.

Don't get me wrong, the entire series IS fun and seasons 1 and 2 have their appreciable values as well; season 1 boasting a wealth of good ideas that just had an awkward production feel to them:

Encounter at Farpoint:  Excessively cheesy, even then, but most pilot stories don't have rewatchable value.

The Naked Now:  Oh good.  Remake a TOS series; but remove any chance at mature character development and add in standard 80s sleaze.

Code of Honor:  A bit stereotyped in ways, with Picard being a real ""donkey"", but in ways it's still fun.  The Yar/Yarina fight at the end is reasonably exciting, however.

The Last Outpost:  Introduces the Ferengi.  Hardly a replacement for the Klingons or Romulans...  Nothing to see here.

Where No One has Gone Before:  Is somewhat hokey, complete with Mr Argyle-Scotty-Wannabe, but is actually pretty darn good!  Easily recommended.

Lonely Among Us:  Better than I'd expected; though corny at moments.

Justice:  The core idea is nice, but making it some sort of 80s-typical nudie smutfest drags it down by 50 notches.  Rubbish.

The Battle:  AWESOME story.  Still season 1, but this one is worthy.

Hide and Q:  A few cornball moments, but this one is still very very good.  Q stories are always winners for me.

Haven:  If you like Deanna, you'll love this one.

The Big Goodbye:  Nice holodeck intro story.  A bit late in setting up future holodeck continuity (Wesley leaves the holodeck in ""Encounter at Farpoint"" all sopping wet...  shouldn't have!), but isn't a bad story and reasonably well made.

Datalore:  Suffers from season 1 problems, and the crew are presented as a bunch of brainless dolts whenever Wesley is around, but Lore is a lovely creation and the good points easily outweigh the bad.

Angel One:  The plot is silly and retrograde, but the eyecandy (on both sides) is lovely.

11001001:  A couple minor points aside, this one is probably THE best of season 1 thanks to novel creations (the Binars, Minuete) and a solid production.

Too Short a Season:  DC Fontana still knows her stuff; this has always been a fave of mine what with the evils of selling weapons and settling old scores...  It needed season 3's production style to be perfect, but it's a great watch all the same.

When the Bough breaks: It's dated badly; I want to like it as the premise is rather nice - especially as the Enterprise crew prefer to solve the problem than fiddle-diddle with its symptoms, that the Aldarans want to do.

Home Soil:  Great ecology-centric story.  Keep an eye out for a recurring Bond actor too...

Coming of Age:  Corny, but passable.

Heart of Glory:  Nice insight into Geordi's vision and I like the use of the Klingons here...  Sets up some Klingon continuity forgotten later on too. :)

The Arsenal of Freedom:  Should be total corn, but I love it.  Good to see the Enterprise split again too.  Another nice story about selling weapons.

Symbiosis:  Obligatory anti-drug story.  A little too preachy and pedantic for my liking, but it is well acted.

Skin of Evil:  One of the better characters bows out.  :(  Yar didn't seem as 2D as the rest.  No wonder the producers wanted her out.

We'll Always have Paris:  Nice attempt at using time as a core plot issue, but it doesn't seem to work.

Conspiracy:  The ending is a copout, and it also deliberately leaves a loophole to followup on (but doesn't), but it is another season 1 highlight.

The Neutral Zone:  Cheezy to the max, dude, but the Romulans coming back is a great development.  BTW:  Keep an eye out for when Troi looks at a close-up of a computer screen.  You'll see the actors names who played ""Doctor Who"" (the long-running BBC sci-fi show).  :)

It's awkwardly made, but the ideas more than make up for the wonky production.  I think it's worthy.",1138406400,5,4361,4.70439414114514

698995,5,6303574289,"Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...

Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...

The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Encounter at Farpoint"" in which the newly built USS Enterprise-D, commanded by Capt. Jean Luc Picard, is tasked with its first mission - to explore the area in and around Farpoint Station. But while carrying out their mission, the crew and passengers encounter a powerful life form known only as ""Q"". The being accuses the human race of high crimes against the galaxy, and he threatens to destroy all of humanity. Now, Capt. Picard and his crew must think fast, or else risk total annihilation... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Battle"" in which a mind-control device placed of a former ship of Capt. Picard forces him to re-live a battle from his past (with the USS Enterprise as the target!), and ""Coming of Age"" in which Wesley takes the Starfleet Academy entrance exam while Capt. Picard turns down a promotion in order to stay with the Enterprise...

698996,3,6303574289,"The first ST in almost 20 years, fans had high hopes for this series, which were later realized but definitely not in this season.

Stardate 41153.7 ""Encounter at Farpoint, Parts I and II"" The worst pilot ever made in ST history.  I could barely sit through it...what was with all the guys wearing skirts? It does introduce TNG fans to Q, who would become Capt. Picard's later nemesis and the most popular recurring character of the show. 1 star

Stardate 41209.2 ""The Naked Now"" Copied from TOS episode ""The Naked Time"", TNG's was considerably worse than TOS's.  Seemed to concentrat mostly on sex. 2 stars

Stardate 41235.25 ""Code of Honor"" Lt. Cmdr Tahs Yar is kidnapped and must fight to go back to the Enterprise.  3 stars

Stardate 41386.4 ""The Last Outpost"" Enterprise meets the Ferengi for the first time, which is enough to make this episode bad.  In the early days of TNG, the Ferengi were more like monkeys, not the smooth businessmen that we came to know in DS9.  So seeing the Ferengi jump around like barbarians isn't a pleasant evening.  On the plus side, Enterprise runs into its first of several extinct species. 2 stars

Stardate 41263.1 ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" The Enterprise is sent a billion light-years into space to meet another exploratory race. 3 stars

Stardate 41249.3 ""Lonely Among Us"" Aliens take over Worf, Dr. Crusher and Capt. Picard.  Must not have been a great episode, because I barely remember it. 1 star

Stardate 41255.6 ""Justice"" Wesley is sentenced to death because of a planet's overly strict laws.  Wesley was the worst charcter ever created and should have been killed in this episode just so we could be rid of him.  1 star

Stardate 41723.9 'The Battle"" Capt. Picard encouters his old command, the Stargazer, and becomes caught up in his old memories thanks to a Ferengi mind device.  The first episode that deal with characterization. 3 stars

Stardate 41590.5 ""Hide and Q"" The worst Q episode made.  Riker is invited to join the Q Continuum.  2 stars, just because it's Q.

Stardate 41294.5 ""Haven"" Lwaxana Troi (Counselor Troi's mother) comes onboard for the first time.  She is the most annoying recurring character, but what would we do without her? That bell did get annoying though... 3 stars

Stardate 41997.7 ""The Big Goodbye"" Introduces Capt. Picard's favorite holoprogram of L.A. detective Dix HIlls.  Crew becomes trapped in holodeck (it breaks almost as oftern as the transporter does). 3 stars

Stardate 41242.4 ""Datalore"" Introduces Data's evil ""brother andrioid"" Lore, who impersonates Data and tries to destroy the ship. 3 stars

Stardate 41636.9 ""Angel One"" Crew boes to matriarchal society and becomes stranded there. 2 stars

Stardate 41365.9 ""11001001"" Repair crew made up of aliens called ""Binars"" take over the Enterprise. 3 stars

Stardate 41309.5 ""Too Short a Season"" Famous diplomat comes aboard the Enterprise and de-ages rapidly. 2 stars

Stardate 41509.1 ""When the Bough Breaks"" Wesley and other Enterprise children are kidnapped by dying race.  For Wesley. 2 stars.

Stardate 41463.9 ""Home Soil"" Enterprise crew finds a bizarre life form that lives in the soil of a planet that is being used for terraforming. 3 stars

Stardate 41461.2 ""Coming of Age"" Wesley takes the Starfleet Academy Entrance Exam and Capt. Picard comes under scrutiny by Starfleet Command, which was rather interesing. 2 stars

Stardate 41503.7 ""Heart of Glory"" A group of fugitive Klingons takes over the Enterprise.  Explores Worf's loyalty issues and the rich Klingon culture.  First time the Klingon roar is heard for when a warrior dies...always a favorite. 3 stars

Stardate 41798.2 ""The Arsenal of Freedom"" While exploring the disappearance of the USS Drake, the Enterprise disovers a planet where weapons have taken over.  First time Capt. Picard comes on an away mission. 2 stars

Stardate Unknown ""Symbiosis"" Two neighboring planets, one with a drug monopoly over the other.  OK. 2 stars

Stardate 41601.3 ""Skin of Evil"" Evil mud being refuses to allow Enterprise crew to rescue the stranded Counselor Troi.  REsults in the rather pointless death of Tasha Yar, which will lead to some excellent episodes later on. 3 stars

Stardate 41697.9 ""We'll Always Have Paris"" Capt. Picard is reunited with one his former love interests. 2 stars

Stardate 41775.5 ""Conspiracy"" PIcard begins to suspect that there is a conspiracy in Starfleet Command, which is soon revealed to have been caused by alien parasites. 2 stars

Stardate 41986.0 ""The Neutral Zone"" The first TNG episode featuring Romulans. War is imminent and the crew also has to deal with revived 20th century humans, which leads to interesting questions about cyrogenic freezing. 3 stars

A pretty shaky start, but it will get better.",1121904000,5,4750,5.032051282051282
698997,3,6303574289,"September 28, 1987 heralded the long-awaited premiere of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Set 80 years after the adventures of the original 1701, the breathtaking sight of the Galaxy-class Enterprise-D in the opening shot ushered in a series that would reach heights not seen before or since in the series.

However, the first season of the series was erratic in quality and the episodes tended to go from 'ok' to 'terrible' with only a few great episodes in the mix. The cast was trying to find a 'groove' for their characters and as a result came off as stiff and over-dramatic. Poor characterization ran rampant. Poor Marina Sirtis (Counselor Troi) got saddled with a terrible hairdo and even worse dialogue, and Jonathan Frakes' Riker looked both inexperienced and dull. Wil Wheaton's Wesley Crusher quickly became one of the most hated characters in Star Trek. Patrick Stewart's Picard and Brent Spiner's Data pretty much carried the season. As everyone knows, both Denise Crosby and Gates McFadden chose to leave at the end of the year.

Despite the above, poor special effects and sets that frequently looked like they were straight out of a B-movie, there are some good episodes here, like 'Lonely Among Us', 'Where No One Has Gone Before' (and VOYAGER thought it had problems?), 'Datalore', which featured Spiner in a dual role as Data's evil twin android Lore, 'Heart of Glory' which introduced much of what the Klingon culture is based on in the coming series, and 'Conspiracy', quite possibly the grossest episode of the TNG in the series, in which a conspiracy to infiltrate Star Fleet by a group of parasites puts the ENTERPRISE in danger.

So, advice to fellow Trek fans who have not yet purchased this dvd - start with one of the three best seasons of the show, 3, 4 or 6, then get this one, or if you're a completist. If you don't want to shell out the bucks, there are also the VHS tapes.",1121644800,,1905,4.7492447129909365
698998,4,6303574289,STNG was the best Star Trek show.  I did not care that much for the first season though but it was still fun to watch.  I bought this because I am kind of getting interested in getting all the seasons for this show.  Captain Picard seems to try to be funny in this season and sometimes succeds.  Worf sure does look a whole lot weirder and different.  The doctor on this season is no good because in my opinion Beverly was a better doctor.  This contains twenty-five episodes and if you look at this price it could scare you a little bit.  Very exspensive but it's worth it.  Buy it if you like STNG.

The extras are generous, but a bit disorienting; interviews with the cast members seem to have been assembled from all over the map, some conducted during the filming of the episodes presented here and some having the ""looking back"" quality of interviews done several years later.  This ""patchwork"" quality doesn't ruin the documentary materials, but certainly detracts from an overall comfortable flow.  Picture quality over the course of the episodes ranges from good to excellent, and the sound is generally clear and spacious.

699076,3,6303574289,"For those considering a purchase of the Star Trek TNG: Season 1 set, I offer the following episode reviews (with grades):
ENCOUNTER AT FARPOINT: As a pilot, this episode does what it's supposed to: introduce us to the series and characters. The actors are initially stiff and robotic in their roles except-ironically-Data the android. Storywise, the episode is weak, but there is a fun cameo by an aged Dr. McCoy. Grade: B-
THE NAKED NOW: The crew is infected with an alien virus which causes them to lose their inhibitions. This contrivance allows us to learn more about their characters' personalities and past lives. Grade: B
CODE OF HONOR: Tasha Yar is kidnapped by the chief of a visiting delegation and the crew must win her back through contests of honor. Dull performances abound-the characters show little emotion in the face of dire circumstances. Grade: D
THE LAST OUTPOST: The crew's first encounter the Ferengi, who are effectively dislikable and disgusting. However, the climactic battle falls flat. Grade: C
WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE: The first engaging episode of the season. A warp drive accident sends the Enterprise to the far side of the galaxy and the crew has to figure out how to get back. Grade: B+
LONELY AMONG US: The crew must deal with feuding alien races that are guests on the ship while a mysterious energy force takes control of various officers. These two unrelated storylines seem crammed together, neither one satisfying. Grade: C
JUSTICE: The worst episode of the season. The crew visit a planet where Wesley is sentenced to death for a trivial offense. Picard inexplicably agonizes over having to defy the society's ridiculous rules. Take Wesley and go already! Grade: F
THE BATTLE: A Ferengi captain offers Picard his old ship as a gift, but it turns out to be a revenge plot to discredit Picard. Some interesting glimpses into Picard's former life, but ultimately an uninvolving episode. Grade: B-
HIDE AND Q: Nemesis Q returns and gives Riker god-like power to see what he will do with it. Riker is reluctant to use these abilities and once again the melodramatic Q fails in his ploy to trip up the ""unworthy"" humans. Grade: C-
HAVEN: Troi's Betazoid mother Lxawana arrives aboard the Enterprise with plans to immediately carry out Troi's arranged marriage. Lxawana's eccentric behavior is intended to be the source of much comedy but it mostly comes across as dumb. Grade: C
THE BIG GOODBYE: Picard uses the holodeck's imaging capability to insert himself and others into a 1940's-era detective story. What could have been a lame premise gains poignance as the holodeck characters come to question their own reality. Grade: B+
DATALORE: The Enterprise returns to the planet where Data was ""discovered"" years before. There they find Data's identical counterpart, Lore, who turns out to be an evil twin. This disappointing episode gives short shrift to Data's origins. Grade: C+
ANGEL ONE: The Enterprise goes in search of crewmembers from a long-lost ship believed to have sought refuge on Angel One, a planet governed by women. The story is basically a commentary on social change and gender politics, but has some humorous moments. Grade: B-
11001001: While in spacedock for a routine computer upgrade, the Enterprise is hijacked by a race of aliens with only Picard and Riker aboard. An above average episode with good character development, particularly Riker. Grade: B+
TOO SHORT A SEASON: The Enterprise is called upon to chauffer an aged admiral to a hostile planet to conduct negotiations. The story focuses on unfamiliar and unsympathetic characters and virtually ignores the regular characters. Grade: C-
WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS: An advanced but barren race kidnaps some of the Enterprise's children and the crew must figure out how to retrieve them. A dull episode with more ""aliens"" that don't seem alien. Grade: C-
HOME SOIL: While visiting a terraforming station on a desolate planet, the crew discovers a previously unknown life form--a grouchy blinking light. There is much scientific jargon tossed about, but it can't disguise a flimsy story. Grade: C-
COMING OF AGE: Wesley takes the entrance exams for Starfleet Academy while Picard undergoes an administrative interrogation. There is enough character development to make this episode better than most. Grade: B-
HEART OF GLORY: Arguably the best episode of the first season. The Enterprise rescues fugitive Klingons from a battle-ravaged ship who try to convert Worf to their cause. An intriguing look at the warrior nature of Klingons. Grade: A-
ARSENAL OF FREEDOM: The Enterprise away team beams down to a planet of arms merchants to determine why there are no life signs and are attacked by a machine that wiped out its creators. Ho hum. Grade: C
SYMBIOSIS: After saving the crew of an imperiled freighter, Picard and Co. discover two societies who have an unhealthy dependence on each other. An obvious anti-drug message is the moral of a disjointed story. Grade: C-
SKIN OF EVIL: While rescuing Troi from a crashed shuttle, the Enterprise crew encounter an oily black snowman of pure evil. This creature kills a main character, whose death is quick and undramatic. Despite losing their colleague, hardly a tear is shed among the crew, even during the final eulogy scene. Grade: B-
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS: Answering a distress call at a remote outpost, Picard runs into an old flame. The plot involves some techno-malarkey about a rip in the time continuum, but this is secondary to the soapy, unrequited love story. Grade: B-
CONSPIRACY: Picard discovers a conspiracy at the highest levels of Starfleet Command. The story starts strong, but the ending is rushed and disappointing. Low-budget special effects diminish the impact. Grade: B+
THE NEUTRAL ZONE: The Enterprise crew rescue people from the 20th century frozen on a derelict capsule while investigating the destruction of several federation outposts. The episode has litle action, but features the return of the Romulans. Grade: B+",1083196800,34,6007,5.062563067608476
699077,5,6303574289,"I am so incredibly pleased that Paramount is beginning to release the entire Star Trek saga on DVD.  This is my personal favorite series.  Of all the captains, Picard takes the cake.  This season begins the entire story of the Next Generation and set into motion some major parts of the show.  The impossible romantic attraction between Picard and Dr. Crusher, the introduction of Q, and at the very end there is a subtle hint at the BORG!  This season, though not as good as the ones to follow, creates a good foundation for the seasons to come.  A terrific addition to ANY Star Trek fan's collection.
My favorite episodes:
Encounter at Farpoint, The Naked Now, Where No One Has Gone Before, The Battle, Hide and Q, The Big Goodbye, Datalore, 11001001, Coming of Age, Arsenal of Freedom, Skin of Evil, Conspiracy, and The Neutral Zone.",1081814400,2,836,4.691780821917808
699078,5,6303574289,"Star Trek The Next Generation-Season 1 is the season that started it all for TNG fans. It's jam packed with 25 episodes that tell entertaing stories and is what inroduced us to the 24 century.
Patrick Stewart was great as Captian Picard. I can't think of anybody else that could have pulled off what he did. I think he's just as good as Kirk and Stewart carried the dramatics so much better than Shatner.
This is the season in which Deanna Troi wears the cheerleader uniform and has the big 80's hair. It's always nice to see someone's beginnings. She wasn't all that hot then, but I love what they have turned her into.
Brent Spiner plays Data so well. He was suppose to be TNG equivalent to Spock. He does a good job as the android who wants to be human. That isn't always an easy role to play, because the character is baby like and raw. I love Data's beginnings.
Michael Dorn has a good job as Worf. He was always my favorite character in the show because of all the agression he always showed. His character is a little minor in this season because of Tasha Yar.
I wasn't that big of a fan of Yar, and I'm glad they took her off. It let them do so much more with Worf.
I loved Geordi La Forge. Levar Burton did such a good job with him. It's the best character he ever played. Geordi's one of the coolest nerds I've ever seen.
I love this show and I'm glad to say I own this season. It shows the shows humble beginnigs. I don't think anybody thought this show would become one of the highest syndicated and grossing shows like it did. It's a must for Trekkies and anybody who liked Star Trek The Next Generation.",1068422400,9,1617,4.253246753246753

Sure, the acting was not as great as it was throughout the rest of the series, but season one was much more action oriented. Episodes like WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE, HIDE&Q, DATALORE,ARSENAL OF FREEDOM and CONSPIRACY are some of the best episodes of the series. If you want to enjoy a few hours of a great television show with a positive message, I strongly suggest ST:TNG season one.",1066435200,,445,4.439024390243903
699080,4,6303574289,"Content:
Although some people feel that season 1 was the worst season for TNG, I thought that it had some great stories. Some of my favorite TNG episodes are from season 1. Althought the cast is not yet at their best, it is still good acting and some of what is actually future character development I think is mistaken as a bad portrayal of the character. Season 1 has a lot of good stories and some truely great stories as well. As for the DVD representation, I was not disappointed at all. The menu system looks good and is easy to operate. The picture quality was good. I have read some reviews that say the picture was too dark, but I would have to disagree with these reviews. And I personally like the fact that it was not done in widescreen since it was originally broadcast for television, not widescreen. I was most impressed with the sound quality which is excellent.
Packaging:
Season 1 is packaged in a box with a brushed metal look to it which I think is quite sharp. When you open the box you will find that the inside front cover lists all the discs and what episodes they contain. This outside box contains a fold out book of sorts which holds all the discs plus a booklet introducing the main characters as well as listing the season 1 episodes. Although the disc container book seems a bit awkward, it does look nice and it all has the added advantage of looking impressive sitting on the bookshelf. Especially if you have all seven seasons!
Conclusion:
In conclusion, I have found this set to be most impressive and would recommend it to any star trek fan, or even those who consider themselves casual viewers. Except for 3 or 4 of the episodes, the stories are good to great, and the acting is good. The reason that I only gave this 4 stars is more because I know that there are better seasons coming up. If there had been only one or two seasons, I would have given the series 5 stars. It was a great season and I know that I will find myself watching these episodes countless times.",1046736000,2,2005,4.39247311827957
699081,4,6303574289,"Having watched Babylon 5 over and over, and studied the character development, nuances and documentaries on that series, most other science fiction stories and television series seem to pale in comparison ... including Star Trek: The Next Generation. I like the idea of a storyline that is developed from start to finish before it is put onto the small screen. I find that the isolated, individual episodes of ST:TNG are not as compelling. The odd story arcs come along, and they may be interesting, like the conflicts between Q and Picard, but they start at Point ""A"" and end at Point ""A,"" they do not go onto another compelling sources of conflict or develop further. However, I have to stand back from Babylon 5 and keep an open mind that ST:TNG is a legitimate television and science fiction storyline as well. I enjoyed ST:TNG when it was on television, and it does pretty well as a DVD set with a couple of notable exceptions. First, why didn't Paramount give this series the widescreen treatment? Second, while the DVDs have the Dolby 5.1 Surround capability, they do not fully exploit the richness of that acoustic level. Maybe Paramount didn't want to spend a lot of money to update ST:TNG for the DVD format, but considering the price of each set, these features should have been there. As for the extras, they are interesting, especially Gene Roddenberry's insights, but there is hardly any new/original material. These qualms aside, and despite my favourtism for Babylon 5, I feel that ST:TNG is still a worthy science fiction series and it should be part of your DVD collection.",1045353600,9,1591,4.831501831501831

The actors in ST:TNG are superb and convincing. Every character is cast perfectly. My personal favorite is Brent Spiner's performance as Lt. Commander Data, an artificial life form. If only everyone had access to a Data!
The DVD quality is mostly excellent. There are a few isolated instances where the skin tones don't seem quite right, but it is tolerable and brief. The sound is excellent.
After watching this series on TV for years, it is nice to watch the shows with no commercials or annoying ""screen garbage.""

699083,4,6303574289,"This first season of TNG has many ups and downs, but has some classic episodes and delivers for the Trek fan. It begins with the two-hour ""Encounter at Farpoint,"" where the crew of the new Enterprise-D meet Q, an omnipotent being with powers like no one has ever seen. Q puts the human race on trial, and Captain Picard challenges Q to a test. Needless to say, Picard passes with flying colors, and the crew moves on.
While the first ten or so episodes are a bit lukewarm and strongly lacking in special effects, they are different from the rest of the season. Sometimes (""Haven"") it's better, but mostly (""The Battle,"" ""The Naked Now,"" ""Justice"") it's just not that good. Everything picks up, though, with episodes like ""The Big Goodbye,"" ""Datalore,"" ""Coming of Age,"" ""Symbiosis,"" ""Hide and Q,"" ""Conspiracy,"" and ""The Neutral Zone.""

I'll admit that I agree with what some other reviewers have said in that the shows were not up to the quality of season three on, but always remember that no show does well in its first season and that they were still trying to build an audience.  Despite this, they came up with some great stories that I count among my favorite episodes of the series.  This includes, ""11001001"", ""The Big Goodbye"", ""We'll Always Have Paris"", ""Angel One"", ""The Arsenal Of Freedom"", ""Skin Of Evil"", and ""Conspiracy.""

The story didn't rush like Voyager, didn't drag along like the original, and wasn't filled-in by violence like in Enterprise. It moved along at an enjoyable pace and every episode gave a deep question to contemplate.

The only thing missing are the 30 second episode trailers of all the episodes.
  Now about the content. All the 26 episodes of the first season are provided. Contrary to popular vote, I think that the first season of TNG stands on its own.

Of course the first season wasn't the best(the final seasons were) but it usually never is.  The greatest member of the crew is Capt.

It made the whole story of the serious a legend to come. It gave all the characters a behind story of who they are. A lot of trekies think it is the virgin of the serious, I agree but I think the start of every saga is the best. One of the best missions that I've enjoyed the most was ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" because it gave a very interesting theory on what is beyond space. And also episodes like ""Justice, Skin of Evil, The Neutrol Zone and the first episode Encounter at Farpoint"", which was the longest episode. I think Yatasha Yar did very well in the serious, but it was to bad she had to leave so soon. Of course Jean Luke Pichard is the best character in my opinion because he is the Captain of the ship and has a lot of talent and also William Riker the first officier of the ship was good too. But actor wise I think they are all talented equally. I also liked season 2 next to this season. I've always liked the beggining part to the serious the most.

699152,3,6303574289,"The first season was a mixed bag; there were many memorable episodes and just as many that recalled the worst cliches that were predominate in the original series. The first episode written by Trek veteran D. C. Fontana was Encounter at Farpoint. It's not the best Trek episode but Fontana (working from a story by Roddenberry)turns straw into gold. The real kick from the story came from the decision to expand the episode to a two hour premiere--hence the introduction of Q. Based on Trelane (from Original Trek) to some extent, Q became the definition of what set The NextGen apart from ST.

David Gerrold's involvement in ST:TNG can't be understated; Gerrold basically wrote the ""Bible"" for the series and deserved to be recognized as co-creator of ST: TNG. He got a out of court settlement for his troubles. Nevertheless, the characters aren't as bold or interesting as the first season of the original series. By the time of the third season Rick Berman and others had more of a hand in the creative elements of the show. The writing improved when the series took an open door policy to unsolicited scripts (due to co-executive producer Michael Piller).

The strong episodes still stand up very well. Yes, this is missing the ""story arcs"" seen later with this series, DS9, Babylon 5 and Farscape. Keep in mind that the idea of doing story arcs was, at best, in its infancy during 1987-8. The weakest episodes are carry a co-written credit by Roddenberry while the strongest tend to feature a solo writer. D. C. Fontana contributes a number of strong episodes.

One of the most compelling and most disappointing is the episode Justice. Based on a story idea (uncredited) by John D. F. Black (the first story editor on the original series), it becomes more pedestrian without Black's direct involvement. He pitched the idea, was hired by producer Robert Justman and then saw his original story idea (which he had intended for a feature film)brutalized and completed by other writers. While the finished episode has a number of compelling moments, it lacks much of the fire of its potential.

The DVD looks pretty good but the picture is occasionally fuzzy at times. The picture here is darker than later NG seasons. The transfer isn't quite up to snuff compared to the later seasons. The DVD I purchased was flawed and skipped a lot. The collectible booklet wasn't much. While the packaging is better than many boxsets (The Godfather boxset was pretty poorly put together considering how important the first two films are to film), the skimpy booklet doesn't offer much more than a paragraph or two on the season and very little in the way of pictures. Although the packaging was a noble effort to make NextGen look spiffy, it's not quite as good as I had hoped.

The bonus features that are included with the boxed sets adds to the interest I have in the show. Some people may not enjoy behind the scenes featurettes because it could detract the excitement of the story, but it's the opposite for me -- it adds to the enjoyment.
Because the collection is distributed on DVD it will display great picture quality as I'm sure the producers intended to be.

The extra features on the seventh disk are nice. Even though Gene Roddenbery is gone, there's archived interviews of him talking about the original plans for the show. The interviews with the cast and crew are interesting, they each brought a little bit of information about the show that you might not have known at the time, like the use of a plastic egg to make an alien.

To the naysayers, let me say you're right; the first season was very campy, just like the original series. And yes, the show got better as it went on. But that's half the fun of the first year! To see Troi in that little mini-skirt pouring her heart into trite dialog; Data, a human actor trying to figure out how to play an android trying to figure out how to be human; Patrick Stewart trying to figure out exactly why he took the role of Picard.

  I really didn't get into TNG until it was shown in re-runs,as it even surpassed the original series in longeviety. The first season was the shakedown. The cast still finding their characters,as well as a handful of okay to bad episodes(The Big Goodbye,11001001,Heart Of Glory were the classic episodes of the season).
  In all an interesting look at the beginning of a new and now legndary chapter in the Star Trek saga.",1026864000,,648,4.560344827586207
699245,4,6303574289,"The first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was by no means its best - the show was still finding its measure, and the constant turmoil within the writing staff didn't help either! Anyway, I'm not here to give you all a history lesson, I'm here to review both the season and the DVD release!
Season 1 certainly had it's high points, with some very entertaining episodes - ""Datalore"", ""11001001"" and ""The Big Goodbye"" are the real highlights for me. I suppose the best, though, didn't really start until Season 3, and this season certainly has it's downers - the lacklustre ""Home Soil"", for instance. All up, though, a good, solid start to a brilliant series.
I'm in Australia, and the Region 4 packaging is very different to the US/Canada release - you might find it interesting. To start with, rather than a cardboard case, the R4 version comes in a plastic capsule case - very durable, it seems, and it looks great too! The original logo has been used, which I personally prefer, but the real downfall is that the 7 DVD's come in a bulky and quite flimsy digipack case. 7 CDs in a digipack = imminent doom. I doubt it'll last very long! Still, the packaging is neat, professional, and looks quite good. I'm happy enough.
I agree that the sound, with the exception of dialog, is excellent!! I'm now very inclined to get surround sound set up in my house, to get the complete experience. The picture looks great on TV, but pop a disc into your computer and you'll notice just how grainy alot of the episodes are. The interface is very well done, though, and it's a nice touch that the episodes appear in airing order.
The set only gets 4 stars from me - why? Just little things like the picture, the ridiculous digipack packaging, and the fact that the shows themselves only got better from here on in! It's fantastic to be able to experience this incredible show all over again on DVD. I have no doubt that Season 2 onwards will get 5 stars from me. =)",1026432000,2,1960,4.492997198879552
699323,5,6303574289,"The first season of The Next Generation wasn't by far the best of the seven.  It was however, a great beginning to the series.  It is very interesting watching these episodes in order again, season by season as they're released.  To once again be watching the whole tapestry develop again is a true treasure.
Denise Crosby's decision to leave the show because she felt she wasn't getting enough lines was truely regrettable, I'm sure by all the fans and I'm sure by herself considering her less than stellar career afterwords.  The one true great thing in her leaving was that it left plenty of room for the development of Worf who as we all know turned into an absolutely great character to include his four seasons on Deep Space Nine.
Anyone who is a true trekker or otherwise can appreciate The Great Bird of the Galaxy's influence on the first season.  From the uniforms (uck!!! guy's in minidresses) to the general feel of the shows.
As stated above, not the best of the seven, but you've got to start somewhere, and while it took TNG some time to get some running legs, as we all know, once they were running, there was no looking back.
Even if you felt you didn't like the first season I suggest picking this up if not for the collector's status, for nostalgia's sake and having the complete TNG history at your disposal.",1026172800,,1328,4.563025210084033

The special feature also gives an insight to the side of Star Trek never before seen on TV. Even the box is great, although since its made of cardboard it may fall apart in the future. The fact that it's on DVD makes it even better audio-wise and visual-wise. A must have for any Star Trek fan.",1025136000,,433,4.105882352941176
699325,4,6303574289,"Here's an indepth review and tips for watching this set. Enjoy!
Audio: A-
  Review-  The episodes sound FANTASTIC in this set.  The music and the special effects sound absolutely first rate.  The dialog, is slightly less dramatic but was still fairly crisp and clear.
  Tip-  One minor flaw...there is a slight problem with dynamic range when these discs were remastered for 5.1 DD.  The dialog and the music/sound effects have different sound levels. To solve this problem, consider setting the dynamic range on your receiver to standard instead of maximum.  This solves the problem, but it is still annoying to have to reset your receiver every time you watch these Dvds.
Video: B-
  Review-  I was less than impressed with the video quality of SOME of the episodes.  For some reason, there is a lot of grain on the print for what looks like several of the first 10 or so episodes.  This is understandable, however, due to the video quality of the day.
  But, what REALLY BOTHERS ME is that the picture is cropped in pan & scan video!!!  If your Dvd player has a zoom out feature, reduce the image size by half and you'll see exactly what I mean.  My guess, is that approximately 20% of the picture is cropped in the normal viewing mode!  Here's a tip Paramount, reduce the image size and show the whole [...] image.  If you would have done this, what we would have gotten would have been halfway in between a pan & scan and a letterboxed image.  Why Paramount, why?

  Tip-  To make up for the sometimes poor image quality and the cropping effect, my advice is to watch the film in a 1/2 (or 3/4 if possible) sized zoomed image.  You'll get a MUCH BETTER viewing experience by doing this.  Be warned, however, that you will loose a substantial viewing area.  For bigger TV's like 36"" and above... no problem, but if you have a smaller 27"" set and have the player set to 1/2 zoom it will now have the viewing image of a 20"" set. Now, this becomes a trade off between size and seeing everything on the disc. Grrr.
Extras: C+

  Well, it was nice that Paramount gave us something.  We have about 45 minutes or so of special features on the disc with overviews of the first season.  Not bad, but not great.  What did annoy me was that there were no episode trailers (This would have only added 13 minutes to the last disc). You can go to the star trek website and view any trailer there, but the website uses a quicktime viewer with a [...sorry] little window and horrible resolution 300x200 ish for all the clips.  One again, Paramount, you need to do better on this stuff. And, oh Yeah, what about bloopers?  We know they are around.
Box Set Presentation: A- to B+
  Although it is probably going to be difficult to keep this thing in good shape if you take it out of the box often (the insert is folded-over laminated cardboard) this package still looks mighty fine on the shelf. I do, however, have one issue to mention.  I think that this set is a little bulkier than it had to be.  Each disc is dual layered..but single sided.  If they would have double sided the discs they would have been able to cut the depth of this boxed set down by half the size. Isn't this suppose to be a huge benefit of DVD over VHS, in that it can take up WAY LESS shelf space? If DS9 and Voyager is done the same way, you'll still need a couple of shelves to store your entire star trek collection on.  A lot Better than ST:TOS on DVD, but it still could be significantly better.

Overall Review:  A Good set, not a great set.  But, what can you do...since this is your only option.  However, why not write Paramount and ask them to have an offer to fix these problems.  How about a blooper and trailer DVD that you can send away for if you send in the proof of purchase UPC's from all 7 seasons of TNG to Paramount.  Hey, what about writing Paramount and adding your input?  (Overall Opinion: B)",1024099200,4,3880,4.373071528751753
699326,5,6303574289,"If you are wondering if you should spend the money for this the answer is YES! I am only on the 3rd CD of the collection but it is TOTALLY different from watching it on TV. The audio is excellent if you have the 5.1 setup and the video is sharp and clear. Every episode is like watching a different DVD movie in 5.1 and NO COMMERCIALS! If you don't want to watch the opening theme each episode just click ""skip"" on your DVD remote and it takes you right to the episode. I sometimes forget and expect a commercial. I plan to get all of them as I finish a season.",1024099200,,561,4.017857142857143
699327,5,6303574289,"If you're reading these reviews, that means there's a good chance you are at least a semi-diehard fan of this second take on the Star Trek franchise. I grew up with the characters of TNG, they were a constant in my life. Whatever else happened, I could always count on them being there at 7:00 every Friday to whisk me away to places I could only dream of. Let's face it, Star Trek is not the kind of show that is universally appreciated. Some people just can't seem to get past the goofy outfits (case in question: 'Angel One'), or the lack of funds necessary to create aliens who have something other than a new forehead ridge to distinguish them (although as all us Trekkies know, this is because most humanoid races in the galaxy were seeded by an ancient Master Race...which is cool). The real charm of Star Trek lies in all the little things...
 The cool story ideas:  The T'Kon empire, an ancient civilization with Trillions of individuals leaves behind one last outpost, guarded by a being known as 'The Portal'. As if that isn't cool. That's from The Last Outpost by the way (1st episode on 2nd disc)
 Neat special effects shots: The Enterprise approaches the orbiting space station and glides through one of the huge space dock doors. From 11001001 (3rd episode, 4th disc). Also, the clusters of nebulae and other galactic phenomenon in a part of the galaxy which no one will ever see again (probably) when the Traveler speeds the ship up to insanity death omega Warp during Where No One Has Gone Before (2nd epsiode, 2nd disc). And who can forget the image of the USS Stargazer (Picard's old ship), its four nacelles prominent, sailing toward them in The Battle (1st episode, 3rd disc).
 Picard Moments: These are the times when Patrick Stewart dominates the screen, oozing stage presence, convincing us of the depth of his character and hinting at times past. This is amplified in later seasons, yet is still present during episodes such as We'll Always Have Paris (last episode, 6th disc) and Skin of Evil (3rd episode, 6th disc).
 Starship Fights: Whenever Starships duke it out, it's automatically a wicked epsiode. No wicked starship fights in 1st season unfortunately.
 Interesting ethical debates: The underlying foundation of many episodes. What would you do in the position of the Aldeans, who desperately need a new generation to survive? - When The Bough Breaks. If you had the power of a God, would you so easily give it up? - Hide And Q.
It's all of these elements and more which give Star Trek its charm and appeal. I've been watching this show since I was a kid, I need it to survive. Which is why a DVD boxed set containing an entire frickin' season makes me want to wet myself. I admit, I'm the kind of person who can find good aspects in just about anything, but Season One of TNG is a good buy for anyone looking for relief from 'Friends' and 'Fear Factor'. It certainly contains a couple episodes I can't stand (Encounter At Farpoint, is it just me, or is there some serious overacting going on...and Code of Honor, just because it's always on TV. Is there any reason they keep showing stupid Code of Honor?). Everyone has their pet peeve episodes however, and with 25 episodes, there's 99% cool, 1% stupid. I like dem odds, and you should too. The packaging is pretty swank as well, it's like you're opening a treasure box every time you want to grab a disc.
Summary: If you're like me, and the sound of the opening theme song somehow triggers endorphin release in your brain, you will want this. You will want it so bad you will wet yourself. That is all.",1023494400,3,3588,4.5984375

699330,4,6303574289,"Why would I rate this with only 4 stars when I am about to tell you how good it is? Why I know that better coming!
When I first popped this into the DVD player I had a little trepidation, I knew this wasn't the best season, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I watched the new crew start to build relationships almost immediately and establish their characters, something lacking in the later Star Treks, and in particular with the latest series, Enterprise. Listening to intelligent repartee and watching people become friends as they become friends with you, is a treat and adds to the experience
The audio is excellent, TNG sounds great in Dolby Digital although I still laugh a bit as the Enterprise creates a bit of noise as it moves through vacuum. The remastering for DVD is very good, the clarity and resolution of the video makes watching the show a real treat, better than new.
What is so good about this? It is as if you could become friends all over again with some of your closest friends - the cast and crew of the Enterprise.

On a high-def television the ship looks even better than ever.  5.1 surround sound adds greatly to the mood.  Don't expect a dazzling surround sound movie experience, but it adds many sounds to the environment, like hums and ship beeps.  This makes a more realistic experience by far.  Also space scenes have nice ship flyby effects.  Overall most people don't believe it, but the price is great!  (don't buy it somewhere for [money] though, it can be found most places around [money])  For over 23 hours alone you would pay upwards of [money] on normal DVD's.  So it's quite the bargain.

I was absolutely satisfied with the first season DVD's.  I saw episodes I had never seen before (missed them somehow.)  I even enjoyed that extra BS they put on the DVD's like interviews and stuff.

The behind-the-scenes information is well done and worth the purchase, and the menus are well-organized.  The preview (Episode Log) screen for each of the seven discs is excellent, with each disc providing four scenes from each episode set to the backdrop of the main theme for the series.  One of the benefits of the package is that production order and air date order are taken into consideration, and this shows with regard to the order in which each title is furnished in the menus (e.g., 121, 120, 122, 123).
The first season has often been termed 'sterile' by some; this probably has some merit given that any new series doesn't necessarily have chemistry from the outset.  However, some of the episodes are in the opinion of this writer among the best in the series--among these, ""Code of Honor,"" ""Where No One Has Gone Before,"" ""Justice,"" ""The Big Goodbye,"" ""Datalore,"" ""11001001,"" ""Home Soil,"" ""Coming of Age,"" ""Heart of Glory,"" ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" the Stefano-written ""Skin of Evil,"" ""Conspiracy,"" and ""The Neutral Zone""--the latter episode perhaps introducing us (albeit cryptically) to the Borg.
The segment on ""Memorable Missions"" was particularly poignant, especially the portion where Natasha Yar (Denise Crosby) reflects on her work on ST:TNG.  The interviews with the Production (and other) Staff were also very interesting and informative; I found the excerpt with Michael Okuda intriguing and eye-opening.

My first impressions other then fun to watch Star Trek were that they missed in a few basic user friendly things that is indicative of a company making a product for the first time - but it didn't impact the joy of watching the show.
Quibbles: interface is odd: the menu interface looks like star trek (nice), but with no info.  The episode numbers are off (first number is 721?), each title has its own color so you cant tell where you are when selecting an episode, and 'return' on the menu doesn't return it goes to the higher menu.  And you must eject the DVD to see the what's on the disc... the container doesn't have that *trivial* info.
Container: nice look, but to big for DVD storage units, i.e. I cant store it, and 7 seasons takes up a lot of space.  If I can't store them, why get them - and this is just The Next Generation.
Verdict - I will get rid of this boxed set and get the series when they re-release the series in containers that fits in DVD storage units - and hopefully in a double wide DVD container with just 4 discs... now were talking.",1019433600,,1156,4.193693693693693

699436,5,6303574289,"This box set is the best set of movies I own on vhs/dvd period.  I have absolutely gotten my moneys worth out of it already and i have only watched it once!!  26 episodes  that's awesome.  I'm not even a really huge trek fan but something always drew me to stng.  It must be the characters.  I think Paramount did a wonderful job in packaging this set.  The sound and picture quality are good.  The menu's are simple and easy to navigate.  My only complaint on the menu's is that after each movie you have to kick back out to the main menu, then select the next episode, then push play.  While that option is fine I just wish there was a play all episodes option on each dvd.  Near perfection will have to do!
  The character development is execeptional.  Specifically in Capt. Picard, the first couple episodes he is very, very hard and unpersonable especially on poor wesley crusher but by the end of the season you really respect him, for he has proven to be the strongest character on the show.  You can also see the evolution of Data in this first season.  Data to me is the comic relief of this show even though he can't comprehend humor!  As for the other characters you don't see a lot of change to them in this first season.
Now as far as specific episodes go i feel it's unjust to rate.  Some are better than others....to me.  But you might think otherwise.  If you are this far into my review you've most likely seen the episodes already and have your fav's. You are probaly deabting on if you should buy it or not. It is a bunch of money, but it's worth every penny that much I can guarantee you!!!",1019001600,2,1610,4.285714285714286

699438,5,6303574289,"THE GOODS:  I adore this show.  There are some very fine episodes in this season, surprise surprise!  Critics of season one are too harsh!  They are NOT true fans of the show.  Patrick Stewart was wonderful and so very entertaining (and funny!).  He IS the show.  Q is absolutely brilliant and how can any real fan of TNG be without two of the few episodes ever made that include him?!!  For shame.  And the mighty Lore is introduced -- Data's beloved brother!  Riker is great, Data's a bit too human for my taste, Troi is pretty annoying the first year, Geordi's just weird, Tasha Yar seems uncomfortable and fidgety every show like she's going through ""issues"" in her off-camera life, Dr. Crusher is a robot and her hair color is to-gag-for, and Worf hasn't got his character down just yet and is noticibly bad.  Finally, young Wesley Crusher, while hated by many for some obscure reason, I think he's okay -- leave the poor guy alone!!  He's a bit nerdy and awkward and all, but that allows the other fine actors to glow extra-bright in his presence!  And Picard's villainous attitude towards the lad in the early going is Grade A hilarity.  But these are our TNG heroes and so love this season simply for seeing them at their youngest! Very interesting!  Again, some great episodes were made, which surprises me greatly considering it was 1987 (ages ago!).  Very impressive.  Cudos to Paramount.
PICTURE QUALITY:  Flawed in many places, visible artifacts in a number of places (white spots appear and disappear), especially in the earlier shows, and grainy, pixelated pictures in some scenes, as if the remastering was forgotten for these parts -- Why Paramount, why?  Otherwise, image is crisp and sharper than I ever remember from TV...it's like watching a whole different show and adds a movie-feel to it that never existed before.  Great!  I am disappointed with the flaws, though, as there are too many to ignore (the white spotting is most annoying).
SOUND QUALITY:  While the sound is overall spectacular and creates a powerful, ""movie feel"" more than the enhanced picture does, there are flaws in some places!  Ticks and crackles, some quite loud at times, make you cringe in your seat.  Seems their sound remastering process created some problems in some areas which, for reasons that elude me, they decided to ignore and leave as-is.  Is it too expensive to fix or what?  This was very disappointing.
CONCLUSION:  While image and sound flaws are very apparent, especially in early episodes of this first season, they are NOT rampant enough to drive you to smashing your dvd player to bits and pieces in disgust.  I guess we must live with it.  TO THE STUDIO EXECS:  Folks, if you're gonna fix things up, like picture and sound, can't you atleast make sure that the enhancing process doesn't come at the cost of creating problems that weren't there when you started?!  That's negligence.  TO THE FANS:  The shows are still great and this dvd set is NOT TO BE MISSED FOR ANY REASON by anyone who considered themselves true fans.  (The picture and sound are not perfect but the stories and characters are still there, and they rule!!)",1018656000,,3145,4.77365491651206

699440,5,6303574289,"Ok, I know Season one of Star Trek: The Next Generation is not the greatest season of the series.  But, when you are a huge fan like me, and you have been waiting what seems like an eternity for TNG to come out on DVD, this set is very awesome.  I think there is a great transfer on the DVD even though widescreen would of been awesome, but that just wasn't a possibility.  It's just very refreshing to watch the show from the beginning.  I honestly have not watched any season one episodes in a great while.  I love seeing Picards fidgeting around children, Wesley Crushers boyish looks and adult brain, Worf more up tight then anyone else, and Data very much trying to be human but not being that successful.  Most of all, and this is only in my opinion, I love seeing Riker without a beard because with or without the beard, he is DAMN SEXY!!!!!!  I am an ardent lover and fan of Riker and Jonathan frakes, so seeing him with out a beard and in spandex is such a great reward at the end of the day.  I'M sure I am not the only one with this opinion, but how I have missed the non-bearded days.  Ok, back to the review.  It's just really nice to watch the episodes, where the beginnings were born.  The 7th disc extra features are really awesome also.  There four behind the scenes features.  There are interviews I had never seen before and memorable mission memories.  This set is a must have is you are a true hard core Star Trek:TNG fan.  If you like the show but are not a huge fan like myself, you might want to wait until the 3rd season comes out because that's when things really heat up.  I think as Star Trek fans, it is our responsibility and honor to make the DVD sets a success because they are honestly put together very well.  Let's make this a success so in a few years, all of Star Trek will be on DVD.  Also, if you edgy waiting for the new  movie in fall of 2003, likely December 20, these sets will tide you over until the movies comes out.  Live long and prosper Star Trek fans.

They could use some touch up but how well can you improve cardboard backgrounds and pastel colors (mostly early episode sets).  The sound quality is amazing.  The DVD is in Dolby Digital 5.1 which I think is great.  I was actually surprised at how well the 5.1 actually sounded, it's as good as any new movie recently released.  Hearing the Enterprise whiz past you in the opening credits is great, the sound shifted from front to rear speakers flawlessly.  The only thing I would like to have seen is an option to play all the episodes on each disk back to back instead of being brought back to the DVD menu after each episode.

I can honestly say that I have absolutely no complaints about the video. Its true that sometimes the sound is not very clear, but is insignificant enough to where I rarely notice it. What I am completely in love with is that it is in Dolby Digital 5.1! That just blows my mind, I spent the money on a great system, and I didn't expect for a min that STTNG would be in digital surround.

Some others have said that the video quality is poor, but I found it to be at least as good as what I remember from the original broadcasts; I think the source material may be somewhat inferior in some cases. The packaging is a bit awkward - be careful you don't drop all the discs on the floor trying to get them out of the box. The extras and documentaries are all engaging and informative, even containing some tidbits that will be new to diehard trekkies (such as the fact that Crosby and Sirtis were originally intended for each other's roles). The DVD menus are designed with the familiar and beloved LCARS motif that any trekkie would demand, complete with sound effects. And the episodes are in ""chronological"" order, i.e. the order in which one should watch them, rather than numerical order (the order in which they were filmed), which isn't always the same. All in all, it's done right. If these sets sell well enough, perhaps it will encourage Paramount to release Deep Space Nine on DVD as well. We can hope!",1018310400,4,1178,4.587677725118484
699504,5,6303574289,"Season One was a great season when compared to the preceeding shows of the genre. It's stories were imaginative and straddled the line from the original series to the ""next generation"". It was akin to introducing a new food to a child; People knew what Star Trek was based on Kirk and company only, and to thrust such a radically different universe on them as Season 3 (or higher) was would have turned them off to this new ""flavor"". The video defects mentioned are NOT due to it's translation onto home media. Rather, they were quite present during the original run; ST:TNG was one of the first shows to be filmed on digital tape, and was sensitive to the equipment used in editing. It's most noticable in the first episode during Picard's close-ups. It doesn't last long, and doesn't detract from the Farpoint storyline. This is a must-own DVD collection that has been too long waiting in the wings. Bravo Paramount!",1018224000,2,918,4.708074534161491
699505,4,6303574289,"Yes, the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was not exactly the high point of the series.  The show would not find its space legs for another two years.  In the meantime, the first season offered a handful of standout episodes.
""11001001"" gave us the first real highlight of the series, and was the one of their entertaining ""Holodeck"" episodes before holodeck malfunctions became the cliched ""crisis de jour"" on Star Trek.
""Datalore"" was exciting action episode with a juicy dual role for Brent Spiner as Commander Data and his brother Lore.  It was also a prologue to a superior fourth season episode (and the utterly attrocious sixth-season cliffhanger.
""Heart of Glory"" gives us our first look at Klingons other than our own Lt. Worf and gives us a good preview as to why the Klingon episodes would make for some of the best episodes over the next seven years
""Conspiracy"" was Star Trek's take on ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""  Uncharacteristically dark (and gory), expecially for season one, this was a high point for the first year.
""The Neutral Zone"" brings season one to a slight ominous close with the re-introduction of the Romulans to the Star Trek universe.  This episode also set the stage for the Borg storyline that began the next year.
(I am giving this set four stars but I have one reservation.  That is the price.  I think these sets are too expensive for what they offer, but that is typical of Paramount releases.)",1018137600,,1451,4.756972111553785

I had hoped to see the epsiodes in HIGH Quality, as opposed to the various purchased VHS tapes of TNG, namely the Pilot Episode.  The box-set package is eye-candy inside and out.  You get the DVDs as well as the bonus Episode Guide CDROM.  This was a great addition to the set, esp. for the price.
My greivences: The video quality is very poor.  Images are very pixalated as you would see in a very poor quality ASF or DivX file.  Also, a minor detail -- The episodes aren't in numerical order on the discs.  Maybe this was done for maximum utilization of disc space.  Some episodes may have taken up more memory than others.
I have some Star Trek: TOS DVDs.  They have better quality than TNG, and they were recorded in the 1960's.
Overall, this box-set is STILL well worth the purchase.  I would still have purchased the set, even if I had seen the video quality beforehand.

  I sincerely hope that the subsequent seasons are using better quality film, or I and many others are going to feel pretty stupid shelling out another hundred bucks.

699510,5,6303574289,"Well here we are at the start of a long awaited journey the release of ""Star Trek"" on DVD. Season 1 of ""The Next Generation"" . Now, I don't intend to review the episodes in the series in details, fans will know that during season 1 the cast and crew where very much finding their feet and that the ethos was very much that of Gene Roddenberry. The crew of NCC 1701 D where more serious than they where in later seasons although poor Marina Sirtishad to endure a season dressed like a cosmic cheerleader.
For the most part the episodes where firmly rooted in Science Fiction although some exploration of morals is evident with episodes such as ""Code of Honor"", ""Angel One"" or ""The Arsenal of freedom"". Although the season takes a dip in the middle with episodes like ""Home Soil"" and ""Coming of Age"" there are plenty of fine episodes such as ""Heart of Glory"" (that introduces the new Klingons in more detail) and ""11001001"" (whose title must have caused Radio Times typesetters problems). Certainly the series peaks towards the end with ""Conspiracy"" and ""The Neutral Zone"" and indeed shows that it is not afraid to do away with conventional TV rules by killing off a major character before the end of the season. Season 1 of Star Trek sets lays the groundwork of what is to come in later seasons, introducing the characters, technology and ethos of the series. I should point out that ""Encounter at Farpoint"" is the complete double episode season opener and not the two part version.
Season 1 of ""The Next Generation"" has an awkward history in terms of picture. If I understand things correctly it was shot on film and then transferred to video for editing. At some point it was transferred to 1 inch video tape for storage and this is the only original format that the series exists in. Now 1 inch video tapes of the 1980's where not as good a quality as we are used to now by any means and so the video that we are left with is not the standard we are used to. Flesh tones in particular are not well represented and the dynamic range is not as great as modern video.
One of the most difficult sequences in ""The Next Generation"" is the trail scene of ""Encounter at Farpoint"", on video this has always been a murky affair and it wasn't much better on Laserdisk. The dynamic range of this DVD transfer is much better in this scene, there is much more detail in the shadows. Colour noise too was a problem before but this seems to have disappeared for this transfer. However colour representation is still a bit of a problem (due to the source material) with skin tomes and general colours having a washed out look. Detail in the picture is superb, you'll be able to spot stars twinkling in the blackness of space like never before. I'll have to take a long hard look and see just how much detail I can spot later, is the crewman walking past the rear window of the enterprise during the title sequence in series one ?
Paramount have treated ""The Next Generation"" to a full DD 5.1 remix. This is an extremely enveloping experience with the thrum of the enterprise filling the soundstage. I'm convinced a shiver ran up my spine when I first heard the sound of the transporter in 5.1, beautiful ! Dialog is crystal clear and well represented while the music soundtrack is rich and dynamic.",1017705600,6,3283,4.510067114093959
699511,4,6303574289,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" which lived long and prospered in syndication, continued the ""Star Trek"" franchise's explorations of morality, mortality and interspecies conflict. It also brought us the chilling prophecy that 1980s hair will survive well into the 24th century. Paramount Home Video continues its ambitious ""Star Trek"" DVD series with the classy seven-disc ""Star Trek: The Next Generation -- The Complete First Season.""
The 25 episodes are presented full-screen and in surprisingly vibrant 5.1 Dolby Surround sound. The set's 20 hours of programming include four new featurettes with cast, executives and production staffers. These promo docus appear to use mostly older footage but still give viewers an insider's view of the myriad challenges of launching a sequel to an iconic TV show. Hardcore fans will find the extras skimpy and the stories familiar, but they are sufficient for most casual viewers. The DVD set's packaging is first-class, with bold but minimalist design on a box that's meant for long-term storage.
The set wastes no time in showing off its digital polish: The title sequence featuring Industrial Light + Magic's painstaking work on the starship Enterprise dazzles, while the composite theme music leaps from the speakers. Overall, the DVD picture appears solid and consistent. Interior shots on the Enterprise's deck gleam, but scenes away from the polished main set sometimes look flat. There are no obvious visual artifacts.
The 5.1 audio won't send viewers scrambling for the stereo button, as too many remixed TV projects do. Center speaker dialogue is clear and tight. Surround speaker sounds soar beyond the usual zippy spaceship directionals, producing a thoughtful blend of music cues, the steady starship hum, phaser blasts and other dynamic highlights. The surround beats many feature film mixes for DVD Dolby Digital.
Highlights include ""The Last Outpost"" (first appearance of the all-ears Ferengi aliens); ""11001001"" (a ""2001"" Hal theme); and ""Conspiracy"" (a messy ""Alien"" encounter). Other shows tackle ageism, sexism and the lot of artificial intelligence (long before ""A.I."").

In a Collectors box with 7 Disks Star Trek TNG has finally beamed down.
The first season has it's up's and downs. However it is a landmark in SciFi television. Never in my life have I been this addicted to a television series.
I have to admit that there are some hoaky episodes with fake looking skies and sets. But overall I believe that they did a great job in getting us hooked to it.
The episode ""Where no one has gone before"" is my favorite on the first season box set. Closely followed by ""Datalore"" and ""Skin of evil""
But maybe the biggest seller for me is that it is commercial free.
Sitting through a Star Trek TNG marathon on TNN with all that advertisement between the segments is dreadful and a waste of time.

While not the greatest Season of TNG, I like it because it has a very unique flavor compared to the seasons that follow.  Looking at it carefully it has a lot to offer.  Here are some episode highlights:
""Encounter at Farpoint"" - Q at his greatest power.  McCoy cameo.  Indroduces the Enterprise D and its new technology.
""The Naked Now"" - While many call it a rip-off, I say it is a great homage to an original series episode.  Its great to see one of the old plots continued.  There isn't much acknowlegement of the classic series these days.
""The Last Outpost"" - A great intoduction for the Ferengi - back when they were mysterious villians and not just comic relief.
""Where No One Has Gone Before"" - More exploration than perhaps any episode of TNG, except that much of it turns out to be in the crew's minds.  Introduction of ""the Traveler"" whom I don't care for very much.
""Lonely Among Us"" - good mystery plot, but is a bit farfetched
""Justice"" - Lots of scantily clad women in a sex charged environment, need I say more.
""The Battle"" - The Stargazer and Daimon Bok introduced.
""Hide and Q"" - Best episode if you like watching Q torture the crew.
""Haven"" - Lwaxana Troi introduced.  Good sequences involving Troi, Mr. Homn, Data, and lots of ""petty bickering"".
""The Big Goodbye"" - One of the most fun holodeck episodes set in Picard's Dixon Hill program.
""Datalore"" - Data's backstory and a great new villian, Lore.
""11001001"" - Binars steal the enterprise from Spacedock.
""Home soil"" - A fantastic discovery episode.  Terrformers threaten to destroy a lifeform.
""Coming of Age"" - Wesely's Academy entrance exam.  Introduces Remmick.  Picard offered promotion to head Starfleet Academy.
""Heart of Glory"" - First episode to look deeper into Klingon culture.
""The Arsenal of Freedom"" - Offers a great challenge for the crew when they tackle increasingly more powerful automated attack drones.
""Symbiosis"" - Two actors from ""Wrath of Khan"" - can you identify them?  Denise Crosby waves goodbye.
""Skin of Evil"" - Unique villian.  Yar's death.
""We'll Always Have Paris"" - 24th century Paris seen.  Time-phenomenon poses interesting problems.
""Conspiracy"" - One of the scariest episodes of TNG involving an alien conspiracy.
""The Nuetral Zone"" - Romulans return in a big way. 20th century humans deal with the 24th century.  Watch for Marc Alaimo [Gul Dukat] as the Romulan Commander.",1017273600,3,2485,4.811764705882353
699582,4,6303574289,"Being a young Trekkie when the series first debuted I wan not yet jaded enough to have any expectations. Therefore I loved it from the beginning. I raced home to watch it and didn't miss an episode for the first two seasons. Older fans embraced the show as well, but the opening telefilm, Encounter at Farpoint Station, didn't draw enough a lot of new fans. It wasn't until later seasons, particularly the Borg, did large numbers of new fans join the ranks. Watching the first season again, I will admit that it wasn't as good as I remembered, but it is only in comparison to the seasons that followed.
  Like any first season the show had its ups and downs. The thing that propelled the series was the incredible cast. They seemed to gel together instantly. All the characters were likeable and each brought something distinct to the table. There energy and enthusiasm for the project drew audiences in. Granted I did have on problem with the casting. Why did Captain Jean Luc Picard, a Frenchman, have an English accent and drink the very British tea Earl Grey? Why didn't they just make him British. Maybe the name was too cool to change. Regardless of that little inconsistency, Patrick Stewart is the perfect captain.
  The stories themselves also showed a lot of promise. Gone was the captain trying to score with every babe on every planet. Red shirts were no longer a sign of impending doom and their was a lot more talking. It is nice to see people/aliens at least attempting to talk out their difference, or figure out ways to resolve their differences with out simply blowing each other out of the sky.
  Now please feel free to argue amongst yourself about which is better and which captain can kick whose butt. But I enjoy the more peaceful view of our future. Well, at least till the Borg showed up, but that is when things got interesting.",1017273600,,1854,4.620060790273556

COMPARE the picture quality with other DVD's you own (or even with the Original Series).... the picture quality of my STNG episodes looks like overly compressed .JPG images.... after taking so much care to ENHANCE the Original Series... why are we now sacrificing quality for quantity ?
Was it necessary to use THAT much compression to get 4 episodes on a DVD or is there another reason ?

This set is well packaged, though not so well it seems as the European version which comes in a faux-prop case. However packaging aside, what do you get in this set? You get seven sparkling DVDs with one of your favorite TV shows on them, you get extra featurettes, you get better than broadcast picture and sound. You get no commercials!!
The DVD menu is presented as an LCARS alike interface, so all Trekkie gadet [people] will get a kick out of it. The sound effects are nice. I haven't found the easter eggs yet, though I am sure that there must be some there somewhere. The overall product quality is high, although I had to return my set for replacement as disc one refused point blank to play ""The Naked Now"" because of disc reading errors.
I have all the TNG episodes on VHS somewhere, and yet this DVD set is a *must*. The picture and sound quality give the episodes a real boost over the quality on my tapes. Comparing the DVDs to the purchased VHS versions, I can see that there is an immediate qualitative leap upward in the DVDs. But that's not all, this boost in picture and sound actually makes these older episodes more watchable.
Is this set worth the [$] YES!! I purchase a heck of a lot of the epoisodes on VHS in the United Kingdom. At an average price of [$] for a pair of episodes, season one cost a grand total of [$], and that is for video tape, which a) wears out, b) gets mangled by your VCR if it goes on the fritz, c) has lower picture and sound quality, and d) does not include the bonus features.
In conclusion, this set is well worth the money, it enhances the episodes by showing them as they were made, it has great quality, and some extras. Buy it!",1017273600,4,1990,4.253298153034301
699585,5,6303574289,"The long awaited arrival of ST:TNG on DVD has arrived.  This is much more than just ""watching the episodes.""  ST:TNG became an instant favorite for a lot of people.  While it does cost ..., it is well worth it.  This is the Collector's edition.  What good would buying Seasons 3-7 be without having the first two seasons?  You wouldn't have a complete set, and it would be worth less money in the long run.
Take Mark McGuire for instance.. he shattered the alltime home run record in 1998.  People rush out and buy Mark McGuire collectable stuff.  Anywhere from signed pictures, to T-Shirts.  Three years later, Barry Bonds breaks his home run record.  The people still have Mark McGuire collectable stuff that is already hard to find.
It's sort of like that.  You can't be a collector without the entire set.

699586,5,6303574289,"I'm very excited to have begun my ""Next Generation"" collection with the Season One box set. Though I'm not much of a fan of the first two seasons - not after having loved season three, where things really got going - I am delighted to finally be able to watch the original episodes any time I want and of a quality that far surpasses VHS and even broadcast television to a degree.
With seven discs in all and at least four episodes per disc, the packaging is slick and very, very cool. An episode index graces the inside front cover, and the seventh disc includes some nice supplemental materials, the juiciest of which is a documentary on how ""The Next Generation"" was conceived and brought to the small screen called ""The Beginning"".
Each episode is presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, and you have the option to listen in 5.1 Surround or the original 2 channel stereo. Each has a scene index, called Chapter Logs here, containing at least eight chapter stops to aid in navigation of an episode. And speaking of navigation, the menus are easily recognizable Okudagrams and very easy to navigate through.
Paramount has delivered a slick, polished and very, very sweet package with Season One and if all goes well, this is a sign of something very special to Trekkers everywhere. Well, Trekkers with DVD players and a several hours to kill. I'll be looking forward to the next slew of ""Next Generation"" season box sets in the months to come.

The picture quality is perfect, and the DD 5.1 sound is a lot better than the original 2 channel stereo version that was broadcast.  My tapes of the series from when it was originaly aired are starting to deteriorate, so it's nice to be able to get a better version to replace them.

Paramount has done their fans right with these sets and remastered each and every episode in 5.1 Surround.  Imagine the amount of work here.  178, IIRC, episodes all remastered in 5.1  Wonderful!  Even the more expensive X-Files sets aren't in 5.1.  So you're actually getting a bargain here.

Finally Paramount has learned their lesson from the absolute RIP-OFF method they used for the original series on DVD, no more overprised 2 episodes per disc that made it practically impossible to get the entire series.  This is a wonderful DVD set, and is exactly the way the series SHOULD be offered.
Unlike some of the others here, I'd have to disagree about the first season.  I personally found the 1st season excellent, and the reason?  Because it was the classic Star-Trek / Hardcore Sci-Fi style episodes that I always enjoyed, not the later soap-opera style episodes which came to dominate the latter series and infected Deep Space Nine and Voyager like a bad plague.  Basically as soon as Gene Roddenbury died, and ...Rick Berman took over, things went downhill fast.",1016755200,2,882,4.86
699667,4,6303574289,"I give the episodes of this season 3 stars, but the extras drive the score up to 4 stars, because they highlight the special place that this show and this season holds in Star Trek ""history.""  The first season contains all the typical defects of any TV show in its infancy - characters and relationships are unfocused and undeveloped, actors are uncomfortable in their new roles, and writers come up with as many failured concepts as truly appropriate ideas.
Gene Roddenberry still maintained control over Star Trek during this season, and you can witness this in the themes and stories presented, and how the cast is balanced.  Roddenberry wanted more of an ensemble cast, without the overpowering stars who in the first series could drive the show in directions he didn't like.  For this reason, you will see Patrick Stewart playing the captain while Jonathan Frakes leads all the away missions, a division of screen time designed to prevent Stewart from gaining too much power in the show.  In many ways, this is a definite improvement for the series and all the others that followed it, for while I dearly love the Kirk/Spock/McCoy trio, later casts were much more interesting overall.
Many of the episodes were recycled from the failed ""Star Trek 2"" series, which would have brought the original cast back ot television.  Thus, this season has the most ""Kirk-like"" shows of any in STNG, which made for a strange fit with Patrick Stewart and company.  Themes often have that typical Roddenberry ""Utopian Earth"" flavor to them, in which our crew is confronted with vague socio-ethical confrontations that push the limits of the Prime Directive and our current American cultural standards.  Short on action, humor, or even personality but big on ideas, the shows make our characters seem more like Greek philosophers than real people on a space ship (very much like the first Star Trek movie).  The Ferengi appear and immediately disappear as the new enemy, then the Romulans do the same.  No Klingons, no Borg, no real enemies or purpose of any kind, not yet.  Like seeing Riker without a beard, everything feels out of place.
You might want to wait for the ""middle years"" if you want the best STNG episodes available.  Later seasons have higher quality overall than this early year did, and the more familiar ""modern Star Trek"" flavor began to appear in the 2nd season, when Roddenberry stepped down and Rick Berman eventually took charge.  Still, to most Trekkers I know, none of that matters.",1016755200,3,2498,4.893364928909953
699668,4,6303574289,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" became a great television series, but it certainly was not that at the start.  The first season was a concerted effort to use the original series as a launch pad and it was not until their first encounter with the Borg that we can really say the series kicked into high gear.  Consequently, the chief joy of watching the first season again is to see how the bits and pieces start to fall into place.  Since I have already reviewed all of the STNG episodes individually, I want to comment on the first season overall in regards to this DVD collection.

In retrospect it is clear the creators of STNG did an excellent job in shuffling around the key traits of the crew on the original series and providing some new twists centered around the notion that as soon as you looked at Jean-Luc Picard it was clear he was no James T. Kirk (""TV Guide"" originally disparaged the series as ""baldly going where one show has gone before""--later they declared Patrick Stewart the best actor on television for that decade).  Picard gets to be the father-figure, Riker gets to be the stud, the ship's doctor is now a woman, the Vulcan on the bridge is replaced with a Klingon, and Spock's emotional detachment is transferred to an android, but with the twist that Data wants to have emotions.  So there is a sense of familiarity without creating outright repetition.

The creators always felt the biggest mistake in the pilot was Troi's telepathic message to Riker and the use of the word Imzadi.  While Peter David's STNG novel alone of that title justifies its inclusion in the Star Trek universe, this ""error"" actually speaks to a larger strength of the series, namely the backstories of the characters.  Riker and Troi have a shared past but so do Picard and Crusher, both of which will be fruitfully explored in the future.  Many of the best episodes of the original series had to do with the background of the characters (""Amok Time"" and ""Journey to Babel"" immediately spring to mind), because ultimately it is the characters rather than the story lines that make a television series great and this will prove to be the same for STNG (e.g., ""Datalore"").  Mostly it was a matter of adjustment and finding the right roles for the characters.  Consequently, in due time La Forge becomes the engineer, Worf the security chief, and Wesley the navigator.  Tasha Yar suffers a meaningless death in ""Skin of Evil,"" mainly because the producers have no idea of what to do with her character (Tasha is magnificently redeemed in ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" in Season 3, which only goes to prove my points about both the show's evolution and the importance of characters over plot).

Clearly the biggest flaw of the first season was the regurgitation of episodes and elements from the original series.  ""The Naked Now,"" the first episode after the two-part pilot, was a variation on ""The Naked Time"" and even allowed the crew to talk about Kirk's Enterprise.  An episode where the characters are forced to reveal their true selves is certainly worthwhile, but not when it functions as exposition in the first regular episode (a similar complaint can be made against Riker's gift giving in ""Hide and Q"").  But it becomes hard to fully enjoy an episode like ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" when it is clearly a twist on ""Shore Leave.""

Finally, we get to add the holodeck to the Star Trek creative license list headed by the warp drive and transporter system.  All of these technologies are scientific impossibilities but facilitate story telling (otherwise a five year mission ends up as traveling halfway to some star system).  Little did we know that ""The Big Good-Bye"" would be the first of what would prove to be way too many ""something is wrong with the holodeck and we are in danger"" episodes.  Still, the holodeck proves ideal for providing change of pace episodes (e.g., ""11001001"") and one of the strengths of STNG was its use of humor (e.g., ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" where Riker talks about being given command of a new ship, the Lollipop, which, he adds, ""is a good ship"").  I also think having families aboard the Enterprise is highly improbable to say the least.  Yes, the saucer can detach and supposedly put the civilians out of harm's way, but not only do they rarely do that during the entire run of STNG, the Borg, Romulans or whoever the Enterprise faces in a fight probably would not have any compunctions about blasting the saucer into cosmic dust.  But, again, the point is that the idea facilitates storytelling.

Clearly the first season on STNG is a time of discovery, which is not unusual in the evolution of a television (go back and look at the first season of ""M*A*S*H"" and count how many times you cringe at some of what they did).  Fortunately, because they were in syndication the series was able to improve substantially.  But I do not recall ever see an episode from the first season end up on anybody's list of Top 10 ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episodes.  Yes, ""Encounter at Farpoint"" introduces Q, but the payoff is just not as good as the setup; still, there are much better Q episodes to come.  ""Conspiracy"" is almost laughable in terms of secret alien threat, but in ""The Best of Both Worlds"" the show would take many of these same elements and create the best episode(s) ever.  The first season is just, as Captain Picard would say, a chance to see what is out there.",1016496000,118,5414,4.704449152542373

Firstly, there were similarity's. Data was similar to Spock and Riker could be considered similar to Captain Kirk. But the similarity's ended there. Everything else was fresh and original.

Picard was fresh-he was very diplomatic and understanding and a good negotiator. He was a good captain but preferred to stay on the ship and send Away Team's down to dangerous planets.

Worf was a Klingon which made for interesting stories. Worf may have been a StarFleet officer but he never forgot his Klingon heritage.

Data was similar to Spock but Data wanted to be human and he provided several laughs throughout the entire series.

Dr. Crusher was the ships doctor and I don't think anyone could say she was similar to Bones from the original series.

The stories were great throughout the series. It would be hard to rate individual episodes but the pilot episode and the last two-parter episodes were just awesome.
