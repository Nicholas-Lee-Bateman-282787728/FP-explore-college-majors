Mr. McGann does a great job conveying information and demonstrating concepts. I have watched it and worked through the songs several times over the two years I have had the video and I still enjoy it and get something out of it.",1289606400,3,402,4.418918918918919
8208851,2,B000TFSR6U,"Although Mr. McGann explains things clearly, I think he tried to tackle too much in this one and the entire effort suffers. There is a section on Bluegrass, Celtic, and Swing, but each is too short to do much justice to or teach much about each topic.  After viewing it, this one felt too much like an overview and not really much use as an instructional video.  It felt like each section was just getting interesting and I was about to learn something and then it was on to the next section!  I was expecting more content and depth than this on a DVD.

If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have purchased this.",1277942400,6,609,4.224137931034483
