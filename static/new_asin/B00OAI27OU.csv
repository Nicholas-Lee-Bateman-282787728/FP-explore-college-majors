8683002,1,B00OAI27OU,"The only reason I bought this disc is because it said it contained ""Lullaby In Swing"" by The Mellowaires and Lud Gluskin Orchestra, which is one of only two Soundies featuring ""The Mellowaires"", who were background and featured singers during the first four months of Capitol Records existence,  as the first title.

Unfortunately, that Soundie does not appear on this disc. Instead, without a title card, its Carol Adams conducting ""The Glamourettes"" as they perform ""Swing It, Mr. Schubert"" (1944).

There is no main menu, no chapter breaks, and more than one Soundie is missing its title card.

Very disappointing.",1503100800,,617,5.14
