8546714,5,B00A4MXTDE,"I have searched for this movie on DVD for years.  It popped up by surprise on Amazon during a  routine search. I ordered it in a rush.  I watched it and enjoyed it as I had anticipated.  The resolution was as it was originally produced.  But it was great!!!

For all the others jealously reading this review, the publisher producing this dvd was Autoworld Productions, item no. APO 153.  It was published as it was originally shown in American Theaters.  The DVD was copywrited in 2010.  I have since found it in French in the European format, but it seems to be one-of-a-kind in English.

Tony, Piper, and company, you guys did good!

Think I'll go watch it again.  jlporter111@gmail.com",1419465600,,688,4.641666666666667
