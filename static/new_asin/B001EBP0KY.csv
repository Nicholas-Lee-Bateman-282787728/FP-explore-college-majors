8297538,5,B001EBP0KY,"I've got all four seasons of the series, nothing the Disney Channel is now running compares with it. The picture quality, if you can play it, is very good although the storyline in 3rd season (the first with 26 episodes) is a bit more implausible.

A new bunch of kids on ORCA are introduced to Neri (and later Mera) and help her throughout the season. Early on the ship that Neri's people came to Earth in is discovered by her friends, it's never explained how the thing came to be buried- once inside a teen boy is discovered in suspended animation. His name is Kal and he becomes a part of their adventures, even on ORCA (no one not in on the secret ever seems to realize he's not human or even a crew member).

UBRI is back and races to gain control of parts of a device that Neri's people sent to Earth that has the power, when assembled, to heal both their worlds. UBRI's Dr. Hellegren and his superiors (seen only in shadows on TV screens) want this thing to control the elements- activating it despite Neri & Mera's protests they almost destroy the world. Kal, who had been duped into helping UBRI (it was never explained why Neri & Mera were always rude to him) grabs the activated device, Neri & her sister save the world by using the thing as only they were meant to.

Kal's the weakest link in this season but still I think you'll be getting some good TV- buy it for your collection.

One last note; I've seen two different copies of this DVD and episode 2 ""Amnesia"" on both of them goes silent near the end, it's just for a few seconds and cuts off whatever it was that Jason & Brett were saying to each other. Stil worth buying even if all copies have the bug, it doesn't really hurt even that one episode.",1361750400,3,1720,4.299382716049383
8297539,5,B001EBP0KY,"I've been a fan of this series since I first saw it on the Disney channel in the '90s.  Obviously in the 21 century it might seem a bit dated, but it's a good family show.  The characters are either likable or not, depending on whether their supposed to be faces or heels, and you get presented with the beauty of the ocean. Excellent storyline and enjoyable people.",1359590400,4,366,4.367647058823529
