8235285,4,B000ZDQI9Y,"That is, the wedge a police state drives between the citizens and personal freedoms. In this case, the freedoms are artistic, but the artists just lead where other amateur researchers, home schoolers, teachers in any school, and lots of others will want to go.

The story starts with a personal tragedy. Hope Kurtz, Steve's wife of many years, dies suddenly, in her sleep. Distraught, he calls 911. Some panicky first responder sees petri dishes and lab gear, and reports this art installation in-the-making as a bioterror lab. While tearing the grieving widower's home apart, the FBI discovers among his papers an invitation to a museum show opening  - with Arabic writing printed on it. Never mind that the well-respected museum sent out thousands of these invitations, that's enough to link him to post-9/11 terrorists.

Of course, there was no case. The Kurtzes were artists preparing a statement on GMO foods. They worked closely with a biology professor at a nearby university, making sure they handled even their very harmless bacteria with proper lab protocol. Never mind, once the feds decided there was a case, they'd make one out of nothing, if necessary. As the terrorism charges evaporated, they somehow concocted a ""mail fraud"" case out of the artists' mail orders for cultures and equipment, good for 20 years in prison. This included samples Serratia marcescens - though sometimes a risk to immunocompromised, I used it as a high school sophomore in route biology classes.

The film ends at an odd moment - before the final verdicts were in. That suspense probably serves a purpose, though, in leaving the viewers with something nagging and worrisome at the back of their minds. Worry seems well placed in this case - if the U.S. vs. Kurtz case resulted in convictions, however inane, that would have been legal precedent for further future clampdowns on legitimate study and expression.

The film lacks explicit drama - recreations of the events interleaved with the principals telling the story in first person. The meaning and point of the film are dramatic enough. I strongly recommend this to anyone concerned about the erosion of freedom and the federally-sanctioned bullying that brings it about.

8235286,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"This very well done docu drama about the still unresolved and wrongly based prosecution of artist Stephen Kurtz for bio-terrorism is powerful because it is without hype and hyperbole and outrage.  Kurtz and Peter Coyote who plays him in the dramatization of events and others involved tell the story of what happened in simple uncluttered narrative that gives the viewer plenty of room to think about and connect to the viewers own sensibility about the events.  The laws and procedures under which Kurtz has been wrongfully persecuted and charged continue in effect.

The docudrama contains some thought provoking commentary on how we allow these things to happen..how ready we are surrender our freedoms when we are afraid.

Kurtz was working on an arts project to both teach and comment on the ubiquitous and undisclosed presence of genetically modified food.  The material he had at home in connection with this project, petrie dishes and lab equiment as well as harmless bio cultures of various kinds, brought him under scrutiny of police officials who responded to his 911 call on finding his wife of 27 years had died in her sleep of heart failure.

I had never heard of this documentary before and see this very artful well done film has only 8 amazon reviews.  It is a must see..a great pick for reshowing on college campuses, at community theaters local libraries and other places where there is an opportunity for discussion after viewing.",1316304000,,1450,4.966942148760331
8235287,3,B000ZDQI9Y,"The oscillating format of re-enactments and the traditional documentary approach made this film engaging. However, if not for Tilda Swinton, this would have felt more like a student protest film than a true investigation into the bizarre events involving Steve Kurtz. Swinton's performance and even her commentary seems to have more balanced maturity than the other faces on the screen, including Kurtz himself. Swinton's co-stars simply do not have the naturalness that she has and so she saves the film at the expense of over-shadowing it with her prime talent. Having said that, this is an important documentary that deserves to stay in print for at least another few decades. Steve Kurtz is now a touchstone in history, even if that is not his intentions and if he doesn't want be one. It's strange indeed to think that today's Open Source Bio groups experiment freely with bio-organisms that Kurtz nearly went to prison for. Kurtz may not be the founder of BioArt, but he was almost the movements first martyr.",1237248000,2,1015,4.976470588235294
8235288,2,B000ZDQI9Y,"No doubt a good review of what can happen in our paranoid times.  BUT, it takes a great deal of patience to stay with this film.  Also the switching back and forth from the film lead and the actual man involved in this story can be confusing.
I am afraid after a half hour I found myself numbed by the prologue and turned the film off.",1218931200,3,335,4.0606060606060606
8235289,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"At a time when the country stands at a crossroads, the more information
we have, the better.  When I watched this movie, I took notes with the hopes
of doing a piece about it as a freelance writer.  Editors thought the story had been sufficiently told.  Ironically, I pitched it the week that CIA tapes mysteriously disappeared.  One of the quotes from the movie is
""Freedom is knowledge.""  If we don't educate ourselves about
what is happening in our country, we are doomed. Luckily, we have courageous documentary film makers that are willing to put themselves on the line to
make sure that the rest of us know what is going on.",1204243200,5,630,4.589285714285714

I've seen this docudrama twice now. It offers a penetrating yet quite understated commentary on the emergence of what author Bertram Gross once described as ""friendly fascism"" - not the jackboots, uniforms and screeching rhetoric, but our 'friendly protection' from terrorism, and at the same time our 'protection' from lingering anxieties concerning genetically modified foods. You wouldn't think all this would come together in a single FBI case, currently pending. But it has. In Buffalo, New York.

One of the poignant features of this film is the determinedly honest picture it paints of the warm but intermittently irritable relation between Steve Kurtz, the central surviving character in this tragedy, and his wife of many years (played by Tilda Swinton), the day before she suddenly died. So is the portrayal of the acute fears of a student of 'Middle Eastern' origin, as he decides whether or not to sign a petition of support for Kurtz, one of his most respected university instructors.

Ask not for whom the bell tolls... This film needs knowing.",1204070400,15,1205,5.80225988700565
8235291,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"I watched this film on IFC, and immediately ordered a copy. I plan on showing this movie in all ART classes and CRIMINAL JUSTICE classes at my university. This documentary tears the roof off our 'friendly loving' government and shows the reality of the situation. We're all 100% guilty until proven innocent. Even then, being proven innocent means nothing, just that they'll try to get you on a different more BS charge!

8235292,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"Strange Culture is, without a doubt, THE most important film about the horrendous, idiotic, policies of the current administration.  The film chronicles the nightmare that is possible when an artist critiques our culture with thought and pointed commentary. On the other hand...essentially, this is a film about what FREEDOM means...FOR ALL OF US...not just artists...buy it...it will remind you of what can happen when politicians and their errant political power go ""unchecked.""",1203724800,3,480,5.666666666666667
8235293,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"This film was excellent. It raises some very complex issues that are so pressing to contemporary society. In many ways this movie is extremely unnerving. Words such as democracy and freedom are tossed around so easily these days...often in the name of distorted political posturing. However, those words also carry with them very high ideals. After watching this film, how might you think about your rights and freedoms today? Don't take my word for it. See it for yourself and you decide what is most compelling about this film.",1203638400,7,529,4.955056179775281
8235294,5,B000ZDQI9Y,"This documentary does a great job conveying a truly bizarre and outrageous (and still ongoing) situation that shows how easily people can be persecuted in the hysteria and stubbornness surrounding the war on terror. It does an equally good job of telling the story of the personal tragedy of these inspiring artists and activists; and showcasing the creative, hard-hitting work of the CAE. The story and its chilling political implications have really stuck with me; I've recommended it to many people.",1203638400,12,502,5.209876543209877
