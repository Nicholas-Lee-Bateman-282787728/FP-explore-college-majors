2678150,5,B000JMKKMW,"Some of the most underrated comedians working today are Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn, Maria Bamford and the find of my century, Zach Galifinakis. Yay CoC!",1173312000,9,153,5.16
2678151,5,B000JMKKMW,"This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews online all the time saying ""anyone will like this"", but seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed. That's a big deal.

This DVD follows these four comedians on their two week tour. Their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city.

Also throughout the episodes, it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in America during her ""time of need"", interpersonal relationships, and anything else they could think of.

This DVD makes me laugh to tears every time. Literally.",1171584000,17,591,4.8316831683168315
2678152,5,B000JMKKMW,"Before I watched this film I was not sure who Patton Oswalt was.  I watch a lot alternative comedy like Mr. Show, David Cross, and I love comedians like Bill Hicks and George Carlin. Patton, Brian, Zach and many others are carrying the torch.  This video is without a doubt the very best comedy DVD I have ever seen.  I liked this video so much I wouldn't let Netfilx have it back.  When I saw the video it could not be purchased anywhere, so I ""lost"" it.  I play this video in the background at parties in my, and it is fun to see how many people take time out to listen to comedians like these guys with no context.  I always hear the inevitable, ""who is this?""  These comedians are the best on the planet it's great more people can see this DVD now.

I liked it beary much.",1171497600,15,776,4.126666666666667
2678153,5,B000JMKKMW,"I saw this at the 2005 South-by-Southwest Film festival, and that night I wanted to buy it on dvd because it is so freaking HILARIOUS! I love Zach Galifinakis so much and this movies shows how truly funny he is! Awesome film!",1165881600,8,225,4.380952380952381
2678164,5,B000JMKKMW,"Patton Oswalt alone would probably make this worth the price to purchase...and if that's not enough for you I have 2 words: Zack Galifianakis. Need 2 more? Brian Posehn.
Even if there's a name in there that doesn't blow your skirt up (I confess I'm not the biggest Maria Bamford fan), there are plenty other reasons to check out Live At The Troubadour, to wit : David Cross, Sarah Silverman, Andy Kindler, Doug, Benson, Jasper Redd, Jon Benjamin, and Eugene Mirman (the best comedian you've probably never heard of), amongst others....
Without giving away the ending, suffice it to say the final, unannounced comedian they bring out as the ""closer"" is worth the price ALONE!!!",1361750400,2,676,4.886956521739131
2678165,5,B000JMKKMW,Each of these artists has lots of potential to go an and do something big. My teenage daughter and I had an Ah HA AHAHHAHAHAH moment with a particular skit that sounded like my wife and I arguing. SOOO funny. Well worth it.,1354665600,,223,4.209302325581396
2678166,5,B000JMKKMW,I enjoyed the documentary from a sociological viewpoint.  I wore a safety mask and sanitized the surrounding area after the credits.,1341964800,,132,5.285714285714286
2678167,4,B000JMKKMW,"Before I saw the video of the show at the Troubadour in LA I saw the documentary on the tour itself and I liked that even more, but it was the best documentary about comedy that I have seen.

This show had some not-as-funny moments, but was still great due to the presence of three tremendously talented comedians. (And I'm not including Patton Oswalt in that trio even though he is one of the best around.) The three are - Maria Bamford, Brian Posehn and Eugene Merman. At the time of the filming of this video maybe Merman wasn't well known - now, thanks to this, satellite radio and some more exposure elsewhere, he is nowhere near a secret. But he is brilliant - skewed ideas presented in a no-bs manner. Something that is difficult to pull off, but he does. He is even better today - that bit of nervousness he seems to show in this video doesn't seem to be as present.

Brian Posehn can stand there and he will make you laugh. (Maybe with a bit of a frightened element in the titters of those watching. But he knows that the appearance of a 6-7 metal-horror geek often produces trepidation and he takes that audience funk and runs with it. He banks on his polarizing appearance and makes a positive and funny impression.) Towering self-deprecation with some comedians seems a sign of mental imbalance (or the feigning of it), but with Brian it comes off as a game(life)-saver. And you can laugh just for that ability alone.

However Maria Bamford was the star of this video for me - she will go out on the edge without a hint of concern. Or if there is a concern it is merely the pretense of a smidgen of concern. It seems that she knows she has entombed far crazier and darker thoughts and the fact that she is holding back on those demons keeps her from injecting prozac directly into her carotid right on stage. Her opening discussion with her pet pug Blossom had me laughing to the point of tears. Brilliance. There are other women out there telling great jokes, but Maria isn't just the best female comedian on the planet right now, she is the best period.

There were other good performances - David Cross, Jon Benjamin and Zach Galafinakis are almost always good. At times things seemed to drag just a tad, but for a two-hours-plus comedy stage show the energy kept going at a pretty decent pace. An eager crowd helped - some shows are doomed just by the locale, but the Troubadour usually doesn't have a problem providing giggles.

Speaking as to the presentation and production it was straight forward and somewhat static, but it is a stage show - David Cross and Jon Benjamin 'stretched' the stage with their hilarious and inventive bit on friendship, but outside of that, it was a standard stand-up review.

Recommended for all those who like their comedy raw - and I don't mean necessarily profane, but not prettied up by TV laugh tracks and movie camera tricks.",1333238400,,2880,4.528846153846154
2678168,5,B000JMKKMW,"I read a couple of review before writing this and the one that infuriated me was titled ""Innocence Lost"" by R. Schultz.  What this reviewer doesn't understand is that actors and comedians on television are not the same person as their characters on television and they shouldn't have to embody their characters in reality.  Having said that, I hope you ignore his review because it's fails at even attempting to be objective.

On to the actual review... I was really drawn to this DVD because I have seen and heard stand up material from nearly every comedian on this DVD and would definitely characterize myself as a fan of each one.  The video is shot in a documentary style with snippets of live comedy sewn in.  It is brilliant.  These comedian are not the popular variety.  They're simply a group of friends who decided to go on a comedy tour together and this video is a window into that time period in their life.  Some of the most hilarious moments are watching them interact as friends (like bearalyzed, you'll find out if when you watch it). I particularly liked this video because it humanizes these comedians.  I found it to be very poignant and moving at times.  It's more a documentary than a stand up comedy video.  I would highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of Oswalt, Posehn, Bamford or Galifianakis.  Having said that, I know that this brand of comedy isn't for everyone, but then again you could say that about almost anything. Check it out and judge for yourself.",1322352000,,1496,4.64638783269962
2678169,5,B000JMKKMW,"It seems to me that people are expecting something different when they buy this than what they get.  I am not sure what they are expecting, but these are funny people with what most would say a very unique take on how things are and how to relay that to others.  I appreciate this, apparently more than some.",1296432000,,308,4.293103448275862
2678170,5,B000JMKKMW,"This was just about perfect for me. I love all the comics in the program.

People should be watching this instead of Dane Cook or whatever.",1294185600,,139,4.346153846153846
2678171,5,B000JMKKMW,"This is my favorite Comedians of Comedy dvd I own. I also have Live at the El Rey, but this one is far more enjoyable. This dvd has a real comedy club special feel to it, whereas Live at the El Rey is a documentary type deal. Don't misunderstand, I enjoyed the documentary very much as well, but this dvd is by far the superior item! Totally worth the cost! XD",1291680000,,360,4.084507042253521
2678172,4,B000JMKKMW,"I originally watched the only season of Comedians of Comedy on Comedy Central and fell in love with Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn, Zach Galifianakis, and Maria Bamford immediately.  It was the awkwardness of it all that won me over, and in a way, cultural anthropology at its finest.  How can we make a situation as awkward as possible?  The end result was hilarious, and soon after finishing the season, I wanted to watch Live at the Troubador.

The content is fantastic.  In between the layers of self-deprecation and inevitably awkward moments, you have this strange sincerity from each of the comedians.  These people do their craft well, and there isn't a moment where you feel left out from any of the skits.  I think people tend to either love or hate this kind of comedy, but for me personally, any person I've watched this with has loved it.  I think some people might hate it due to the amount of vulgarity, but this is what comedy is about.  It's taking the moments in life that are private or should be private and making it hilarious.  Comedy isn't about normalcy.

The only thing that greatly disappointed me was the high turnover of performers.  I wanted quality not quantity.",1285372800,,1189,4.690821256038648
2678173,2,B000JMKKMW,"Most of the comedian were just crap except for a very small few. A lot of crude or corny humor. Patton Oswalt was the most hilarious but he was just pulling jokes from his previous acts. Overall, I regret wasting my time and money on this.",1274745600,,239,4.217391304347826
2678184,4,B000JMKKMW,"This DVD seems to get mixed reviews on here, and I think the biggest problem occurs when viewers don't know what they're getting into.  If you are unfamiliar with the comedic style of Brian Posehn and Patton Oswalt, if you are only familiar with their TV characters (Brian Posehn from ""Just Shoot Me"" and Patton Oswalt from ""King of Queens""), I imagine you will be disappointed.  If you have never heard of Zach Galifinakis, you might be a little shocked.  A quick search on Youtube for snippets of their respective standup routines should clear up any questions you might have about who they are.

If you are a fan of Brian Posehn, Patton Oswalt, and Maria Bamford, I think you'll be impressed with this DVD.  Zach only plays a minor role and at his exit you wonder if it's sincere or if it is just part of his game (as Zach is known for staging uprisings during his standup show).  Brian Posehn is far and away the highlight of the program, and the only real disappointment is that the program didn't last longer.",1252972800,3,1015,4.51912568306011
2678185,5,B000JMKKMW,"Having seen the excellent ""Comedians of Comedy"" TV series I was expecting simply more of the same but this disc gives a surprisingly different angle to the antics of four very underrated stand-up comedians on tour.

What's not shown in most blurbs is that for a measly $10, a DVD-14 disc is included -

Side A - (DVD-9) - The Comedians of Comedy (Documentary/Reality Film)
  + Deleted scenes.
  + Making of.
  + Various bits from other rising Indie comedians.

Side B - (DVD-5) - ""Live at the El Rey"" (Comedy concert)

Comedy is very subjective, but for anyone with any interest at all in intelligent, alternative, dry or quirky humor, then this DVD will not disappoint.

It's difficult to choose a favorite comedian, since they're all capable of pulling big laughs but I personally found Maria Bamford to be a fascinating and truly unique comic and possibly the best character impersonator I've ever witnessed.  It truly surprises me that we haven't seen more of her on TV and film but that can also be said of the others too.

Highly recommended.",1247616000,4,1048,4.723756906077348
2678186,3,B000JMKKMW,"Very uneven and ultimately unsatisfying.  Several of the comedians featured here were astonishingly unfunny.  Several were very very good but we only see a couple minutes of them and then they're gone.  Some on the other hand were very funny, and yet they overstay their welcome and become tiresome.  A few here are brilliant.  But watching this DVD is a frustrating experience.  By the end, I wished I had simply bought separate DVDs of some of the better performers like Patton, Maria Bamford, or Andy Kindler.  Except that I can't find separate DVDs.  Why is that?  Why does someone like Maria Bamford not have her own DVD?!

Three stars on the strength of the better performers presented here, although we don't see enough of them.",1230940800,6,735,4.808
2678187,3,B000JMKKMW,"This DVD features great comedians and some very funny moments, but it really suffers from too many performers and not enough time for each. Each comic comes on stage, tells 2 or 3 jokes and then introduces the next comic. It's an interesting concept, and I applaud Patton and the guys for trying something new and different, but unfortunately it doesn't translate to DVD very well, IMO. The DVD plays like 2 hours of emceeing with no main act. I would rather have a 2 or 3 or 4 disc set that has more of each performance or (even better) just pick the best 4 or 5 comedians and give them each a 20 or 30 minute set. Also, I know that it says there are 15 comedians on the back, but I kinda think that having 4 popular comedians on the cover is a little misleading. It gives the impression that you actually get to see more than a couple of minutes of them performing! The new comics were great, I'm glad they're on the DVD, but I'd like to see more of them too! Interesting concept, funny stuff, I just hope they come up with a better presentation next time.",1217289600,12,1058,4.242574257425742
2678188,5,B000JMKKMW,"The talent and material presented in this epic-long performance is just outstanding.  People who don't like this are morons and their opinions are wrong.  Take it from me, I know truth - even when talking about opinions.  Your welcome.",1202774400,7,235,4.9743589743589745
2678189,5,B000JMKKMW,"I loved the tv show and the previous dvd they released, and this was not a let down. Very funny, has a good portion of my fav comedians who are kinda ""alternative"" comics. Even if you like a few of these comics buy this, cause you will end up liking them all, a few of the lesser known comics (to me atleast) were as funny if not funnier than any of the main comedians.",1201132800,4,369,4.0
2678190,5,B000JMKKMW,"I'm so glad I read the review by R. Schultz.  It was such a pick-me-up. I giggled 'til I almost peed. I'm really not sure how to process the opinion of anyone who is lamenting the pop culture passing of Skippy from ""Family Ties"".  I'm sorry that Marc Price has disappointed you, Mr. Schultz.  I, too, miss the hi-larious way he used to fawn all over Mallory...  Oh, Skippy, will you ever win?

As far as Patton Oswalt goes, I think he's done a great thing with this tour.  He showcases comedians that are smart, edgy and not-so-mainstream.  Brian Posehn and Maria Bamford are very funny.  And Zach Galifinakis is plain nuts.  Reminds me of Andy Kaufman when he wasn't on ""Taxi"".  As for comparing Patton Oswalt's stand-up to his appearancees on ""King of Queens"", I've always maintained that he was slumming when he was on that show to pay the bills and be able to do things like we see on this DVD.  He played the lovable, misunderstood, third-fiddle doughboy on TV, and did a fairly decent job of it.  But it doesn't come even close to the razor-sharp wit he displays in his stand-up act.

I've only been to one frat party, and once was enough.  But anyone who thinks of Zach Galifinakis as a sloppy frat boy would yearn for the yesteryear clean-cut humor of that wacky Skippy.  Mr. Schultz, there's this show called ""Saved by the Bell"" you might want to check out...",1193875200,11,1368,4.481781376518219
2678191,5,B000JMKKMW,"THis is just great entertainment, the kind you cant get on tv, unless you have premium cable or something, what am I a bush crony government contractor?, I don't get paid 19 million for a washer (look it up)",1191542400,2,207,4.333333333333333
2678192,5,B000JMKKMW,"What is great about The Comedians of Comedy is that it is not your typical comedian DVD. We have become so lazy as a society that even sitting on our sofa and watching TV can't be enjoyed unless our shows are explained in detail and wrapped up in a simple little package. The Comedians of Comedy is an example of what comedy is. Its more than some guy standing in front of a mic explaining the difference between white people and black people. Its timing, its irony, its looking at life and saying WTF?

But beyond that, this DVD shows a different side to comedy that we don't normally see and that is the comedians point of view. Patton Oswalt created this tour which is a bunch of comedy shows in ""Indie rock"" establishments to promote the idea that a comedian's career can be followed like a bands career. That is what this DVD is showing. So for those who need things spelled out for them (like R. Shultz) The Comedians of Comedy is SO FAR from frat humor its comedic that one would say this DVD contains the sense of humor of a frat guy. If anything, all the comedians on this DVD hate frat guys! They are simply doing what they love and really couldn't care less what other people think about their humor. Ok Im done with my preaching.",1173484800,38,1241,4.349137931034483
2678193,1,B000JMKKMW,"Avoid this DVD unless you enjoy hanging around frat parties after everyone has gotten sloppy drunk.

It's not that the comedians featured on this DVD are actually drunk. The men just naturally seem to have sloughed into some degenerated mental state. As we watch snippets of their acts and their lives on tour, we can only ask - ""What sewer blew up?"" Because that's what gets spattered on the screen here - clumps of vulgarity and pointless droppings.

 Maria Bamford, the only woman in this troupe of clowns, is the exception. She does seem to have an actual act prepared. Her imitations and characterizations of people on the fringes show talent. But what little we get to see of her here isn't enough to rescue this DVD from the trash pile. She should extricate herself from this company and strike out with a DVD of her own.

On second thought though, there might be some reason to view this mess after all. It does have the lurid fascination of a car-crash, because it's a painful view of a career imploding. It shows why Patton Oswalt is unlikely to have any prominence five years after ""The King of Queens,"" (where he plays the intellectual and innocent Spence), goes off the air.

So many TV sitcoms have featured innocents who come to be the heart of their shows. ""Taxi"" had Reverend Jim; ""The Honeymooners"" had Ed; ""Family Ties"" had Skippy; and ""Seinfeld"" had, in his way - Kramer. Sometimes when their signature roles in these sitcoms end, these individuals strike out, radically trying to avoid being stereotyped as the characters that made them popular. And it's not that any real comedy fan would want to pin people eternally to those roles. But neither does any fan want to see comic actors so willfully become just undeveloped negatives of their sit-com depictions. The comics end up betraying all the good qualities that they brought to life in those characters.

That's what Patton Oswalt does on this DVD as he recasts himself as the anti-Spence. And it foreshadows the sorry decline of a career. Marc Price, who played Skippy on ""Family Ties,"" ended up pedaling such a lame stand-up act that he went into eclipse and was even eliminated in early rounds of ""Last Comic Standing."" And we know what happened to Michael Richards in his desperate attempts to wring some humor out of his stand-up repudiation of anything Kramer-like. We witness the similar plummeting of Patton Oswalt here.

So if you want to see a couple of would-be comedians self-destruct, this is the film for you. But if you want to see actual comedy, it might be better to check out some of the Montreal Comedy DVDs. They enforce a little bit of structure and a few standards in Montreal, without limiting any of the comics' possibility of delivering edgy, observant acts.",1173312000,5,2759,4.747390396659708

I'm also a big fan of some of the comedians who contribute, such as Davis Cross and Sarah Silverman. Unfortunately, Patton got drunk early on in this special, and I think his lack of focus proved contagious for the other comedians. There are certainly some good jokes to be had, but they're precious few for a show that runs well over two hours in length.

I guess I was disappointed because a typical stand up special only runs 45-10 minutes, and it's typically a nonstop bout of hilarity- it has a very high ratio of laughs per minute. With this show, it just seemed to drag with poor pacing, plenty of downtime, quite a bit of confusion, and what seemed to be a lack of enthusiasm from the comedians involved. David Cross even joked at length about how inconvenient it was to come out to LA simply to entertain the request of a friend (Patton)... but a lot of truth is said in jest, of course. The show also suffers from some repeated material that has been used in other specials. Nonetheless, this was a valiant effort by Patton, and at the very least, you can see some backstage interactions among the comedians as they drink beer and eat cookies shaped like the Star of David.",1364688000,2,1263,4.491304347826087
