5711585,5,B00565B134,"I came accross this film after I first ""discovered"" the Auschwitz Album. I ordered several editions of the Album and studied it as well as I could. I think I had layout of Auschwitz II imprinted in my mind, and the sequence of events of that single day of Hungarian Jews deportation, reflected in 188 photos of the album.

Then I stumbled upon this film. I think Uwe Boll found absolutely presise tone to make it. This deliberately dull tone makes a deafening effect of presence. As if you found yourself all of sudden there at that time on that day. For real.

I think this is the best film about the Nazi Jew-killing ""facility"" of Auschwitz II / Birkenau I saw.",1389830400,10,663,4.426229508196721
5711586,2,B00565B134,"Maybe you are a history teacher looking for something about the Holocaust, some good video, informative and educational, to show in your class. You may think about ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Shoah,"" ""Holocaust"" (starring Meryl Streep) - the list would be long.

But you should stay away from Uwe Boll's ""Auschwitz"" because you will be only disappointed. (And do not confuse this with a BBC documentary ""Auschwitz - The Nazis And The Final Solution."") Boll's ""documentary"" may be well-intentioned, but lacks the skill and budget to achieve what it sets out to do.

Boll's ""Auschwitz"" begins with a commentary from the producer/writer/director Uwe Boll himself (who also appears later as an SS gas-chamber guard) about his motive for making this film. Then young German teenagers are interviewed about the Holocaust. They do not know much about it, according to the film, though I don't know if they really represent the German students in general.

The introductory section is followed by the main section of the film, a dramatized part which attempts to describe what it was like being in Auschwitz. I am not an expert of modern history, so I think I should not write about accuracies or inaccuracies of the film. All I can say is that Boll certainly has a unique viewpoint on the dehumanizing processing at the concentration camp, as shown in a scene of two German officers discussing the killings in a matter-of-fact way. However, the director's attempt to realize ""a day in the life"" at the concentration camp is too brief and heavy-handed, weakened by other lengthy and poorly-edited scenes with graphic and gratuitous violence.

The film concludes with an interview section with a different group of students, who seem to know much better than the first group. Being a teacher myself, I find watching their interviews pretty interesting, but not enough to make a good documentary. What is wrong with ""Auschwitz"" is simple. For all the earnest message of the director trying to raise awareness, the low-budget film that suffers technical inadequacies adds little to what we already know.",1363910400,5,2100,5.078260869565217
8579845,2,B00565B134,"Uwe Boll is known mostly for his ridiculous B-movies, some of which had horribly racist skits and jokes that made fun of Jews in concentration camps. While there isn't anything inherently wrong with doing that kind of edgy comedy, it must be understood that this film is a strategic virtue signal to the film industry and his fans. He uses all the same sets, props, and actors from other movies (namely, the funny Blubberella) to depict the daily toil of German soldiers and camp residents, including gassing and shooting their kids. The low-cost production seems like a cheap PR stunt to show the world he actually cares about the Holocaust. That's primarily a German guilt thing, as all modern Germans (even the recent immigrants) are scrutinized and shamed by the world for their role in history. So much to the point that their public education system is designed to instill a profound sense of guilt into their children and future generations. This is further evidence by the interviews with teenagers peppered throughout the 'movie'.

Few things make me cringe more than listening to high school kids answer questions about history. I don't get much relief knowing that German students are as dumb as Americans their age. Some had no clue how to answer basic questions about WW2, some didn't seem to care, but worst were the ones who thought they knew the answers (and where either wrong or only half-right). It didn't help that some of the questions were loaded. The Holodomor in the former Soviet Union is touched upon briefly, as are other examples of genocide and ethnic cleansing around the world. But all of the students shared same belief: Germany was worse than them all! It is at this segment that Boll and his interviewers really miss an opportunity. Why is the Holocaust treated with divine reverence when compared to other genocidal acts? Why were Jews seen as unwanted invaders? How did they impact German culture in ways that the Nazis refused to tolerate? It was definitely more than just having a different religion, looking different, or working as bankers (which one confident student seems to think had it's roots in the middle ages; Christians simply refused to be bankers so Jews had to take those jobs). No, there is a cultural aspect overlooked. One aspect is the practice of usury and it's place in Jewish/Hebrew culture going back thousands of years. It is partly how they financially survive as a minority living in other (majority) cultures. Charging interest was a brilliant way for some wealthy Jews to do business with non-Jews, especially in a time when Jewish doctors, jewelers, merchants, etc, were not fully trusted. Germanic Christianity was traditionally against the practice, but I digress.

Following the cringe-parade of students struggling to answer his questions, we are left with the grand finale. Boll gets on his soapbox and lectures us about animal rights, cruelty, modern genocide, and of course, his self-righteousness posturing about atheism and unspoken resentment about God doing nothing to prevent suffering. At least we know he believes in recycling, because that is what 90% of the 'movie' sections are; recycled material from his other low budget movies.

Think of it as a low low budget 'Schindler's List' minus Schindler, interspersed with late-night talk show-style 'ask the public about history' interviews. It's a convoluted mess.",1529971200,,3395,5.058928571428571

8579849,3,B00565B134,"This was OK. I don't think it accurately covers the magnitude of the situation. The gas chambers were not sparsely filled nor were the trains. There have been some excellent films made on the subject that I believe mirror closer to the actual events. The interviews of the kids in the beginning was infuriating. History is not well taught today, the film did an excellent job of showing this.",1506988800,3,392,4.695652173913044

8579851,5,B00565B134,"This is a fine movie. As Uwe Boll, says in the beginning of the film, he is not trying to show more nobility, sacrifice, and heroism. He is showing the venality, the grind of the daily moil in the system. How dehumanized the killers were by their work, and like the old saw goes you can get used to anything. It must always be remembered that the large majority of Germans, as with many gentiles saw Jews as less than human, non Christians, and that pogroms were common over the centuries.  The SS was just another albeit most deadly force of technocrats who were wholly amoral, and convinced others that they were doing God's work. What is more disturbing, is the ignorance shown by  today's world about cause and effect in history. Kudos  Mr. Boll for doing exactly what he said in his preface. Seems odd that the Jewish people, support this work. This let's one know it be value. Fascinating and well worth seeing.",1453420800,7,917,4.545454545454546

8579853,5,B00565B134,"I am glad this film was produced because it is important not to forget this horrific time.  I visited both
Auschwitz and Dachau. The film must have been made before my visits to these concentration camps
as  they were  pretty much sanitized by then. The film was gruesome enough, but the true story had to
be beyond what was depicted in the movie. Nothing like Schindler's List where  many prisoners were
saved. Interesting that so much seemingly authentic footage of all the carnage was preserved enough
to be able to include it in the film.. I recommend seeing this movie to every American as a reminder of
how fortunate we all are not to have had to endure the atrocities we viewed while sitting in a theater or
in the comfort and safety of our own homes.  God bless America!",1437955200,10,778,4.5285714285714285
8579854,4,B00565B134,"This can be looked at in three different ways. One being a Uwe Boll film, one being an exploration into a moment of history, or an exploitation in violence. I had been wanting to see this film for many years. This is the first time it's officially, had a release in America. Martini Entertainment, a Division of Olive Films, has brought this to DVD for fans of Boll, or fans of history through visual exploration. This is a different approach to the history lesson of the Holocaust. Any movie lover will know that Boll is a controversial director that never hides his violent imagery in films. Boll has never watered down his films, and most of his films are exploitative in the disturbing reality, just for the nature of being disturbing.

There are no heroes. No good guys. No savior. This is nothing but slaughter, and the cattle is human. The setting is during the holocaust. Something I feel as Boll states introducing this film, that Hollywood, and film makers, always tend to wrap the horrible subject of the Holocaust around a savior, or aspect of someone saving, or stepping into help. Yes these heroes and saviors happened, but in most regards, and most moments of the holocaust, there was no hero's, or saviors, millions died. This is an unflinching brutality. And this is an eye opening experience. The darkest reality of evil is to forget the truth of what happened, and to not teach the real reality of the Holocaust and WW2. Now I don't mean that this is historically sound, what I mean is, it's a film that shows the brutality, and the simple matter of fact way, of cattle being led to slaughter, as if no big deal, accept the cattle was human beings. This film showcases that. There is no grand story, no brilliant acting, no award worthy cinema shots, it's just Nazi's, Jews, and murder.

This is a mixed film, part Documentary, part real footage of the concentration camps, and part fictional drama. This starts out with Boll explaining why he did this. Then you witness some teenagers being interviewed about the Holocaust. This reality is an eye opening experience in showcasing just how unlearned many of the population is about WW2, and the Holocaust. The graphic content that becomes this film is a back burner, because listening to these kids is more shocking in how they explain, or talk about the Holocaust. One might simply say these kids are stupid, but it's not their fault, it's the grownups, and the school system, and the government that is stupid, and inhuman in not teaching, and explaining, and making sure the holocaust is never forgotten. Then you move onto a dramatized, moments of the Jews in the Trains, then undressing, and led into the shower where you witness the gassing. You also get moments of shootings, and Nazis going about their work leading the people to the slaughter. Its a simple film, part documentary, and part dramatized mayhem, but it is a film that can stir emotions within the watcher, and if it doesnt, then you might want therapy.
