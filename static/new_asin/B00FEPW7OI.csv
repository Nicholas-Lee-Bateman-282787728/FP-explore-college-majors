5982715,3,B00FEPW7OI,"This DVD was in the ""DVD Concert"" category online.  However, it is a documentary of the five women.  I ordered this for my special needs son who enjoys music.  Naturally, I was disappointed that there was no music.  There are four movies included in the DVD, but little music.",1410739200,6,276,4.571428571428571

8614955,1,B00FEPW7OI,"This DVD was a pure disappointment- boring and totally against what you expect from it. Very chaotic and full of comments of other people, instead of just concentrating on the stars and showing actually more from their lives and concerts/songs. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! It was a huge disappointment and an absolute waste of money!",1482969600,,340,4.982456140350878

8614962,4,B00FEPW7OI,"I bought this because of Reba, but it also features Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, Faith Hill and Miranda Lambert. The main feature is a 70 minute documentary on the background of each singer. There are four bonus films included as well on a single sided disc. With each film running 92-95 minutes each and the documentary running 70 minutes, the video quality on this disc is lower than expected with 443 minutes. If Echo Bridge would've only included two films in addition to the documentary, the compression would've been less and the video would've been crisper. I am not complaining as I expected this, especially at the low price listed. If you're a fan of any or all of these women, this documentary will give you a little more incite into their lives and careers. Recommended for any country music fan.",1431734400,4,811,4.75886524822695
