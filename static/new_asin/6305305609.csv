7888056,4,6305305609,"""Singin In My Soul"" features ninety minutes of uplifting gospel and praise music, testimonies, inspiration stories, and comedy. I especially enjoyed the bright color contrasts that enhanced the filming that clearly captured the radian joy expressed in the wide smiles and twinkling eyes reflected in the countenances of the Homecoming Friends, as well as the obvious enjoyment of the musicians.

I found it hard to pick favorites among the eighteen familiar songs featured. This a fast moving, nostalgic, concert giving a glimpse into the past while offering the promise of an exciting future for more gospel singing and Homecoming Concerts.

Thoroughly enjoyable, highly entertaining, and amazingly inspirational.",1310083200,,714,5.663551401869159
7888057,5,6305305609,"One of the very best I have seen of the Gaither series.  Testimonies from  Howard Goodman, Roger Bennett, and Jeanne Johnson, after she sang ""If  that isn't love"", will move you from laughter to tears in the space of  few songs. Bill Gaither's performance of ""I believe, help Thou my  unbelief"" is the most powerful I have seen in a long time. I found  that I wake up in the mornings, or even while taking a tea-break, and find  that there is singing in my soul, after watching this masterpiece.  Highly  recommended.",969321600,2,517,4.532608695652174
