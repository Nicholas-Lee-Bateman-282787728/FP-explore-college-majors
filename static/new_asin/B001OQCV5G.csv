3732317,1,B001OQCV5G,"If you want to see two people have the least amount of chemistry on screen - please watch this! I didn't expect anything, but decided to watch it because of all the hype that surrounded it. Hahaha, what a hilarious mistake! Can I be on team no one? I don't get it. Honestly, the best part of the movie is when it's over, because then you don't have to see Kristen Stewart awkwardly wiggle around with her mouth agape anymore. COOL!",1522368000,,431,4.333333333333333

It was just such a pleasure to read - I cared much more about whether she becomes a vampire than about whom she chooses (Team Edward vs Team Jacob). I read the whole series in less than a week. Wanna great series for a long vacation etc?
 get this. It's not Shakespeare, but the author can tell a good tale. I did read the series before I saw the movies. I liked the movies fairly well but don't see the movies first!! It would totally ruin it.",1508889600,,493,4.030612244897959

3732607,5,B001OQCV5G,"There are some difference between the book and this movie, but it brings the story to life vividly.

It begins with Bella's Birthday Party.  An accident caused Bella to have a major cut on her arm.  Though all, but Jasper, resisted;  the blood instantly turned the Cullens, from a Sweat Family, to Ravenous Vampires.

That was enough to convince Edward he needed to leave Bella.  Edward revered humans.  He's clearly More than Human, and believes himself Less than Human.  He deliberately breaks Bella's heart, hoping she'd get over him and live a normal life.  Obviously that doesn't work!

Bella spends most of the movie lost.  She believes the lie, believes she's unworthy of Edward.  With him gone she was stuck never moving forward.  She couldn't live without her memories of him, without knowing he was somewhere in the world.  At the same time thinking about him was too painful to endure.  Throughout all that, at some level, she clearly knew Edward had never stopped loving her.

Throughout most of the movie Bella pursued more and more dangerous activities.  Risking her life repeatedly.  Though she wasn't consciously trying to kill herself, yet, she hadn't any reason to live.  Even falling for Jacob wasn't enough to heel Bella.  On many levels she clearly wanted to die, to end the pain.

Next is Bella and Edward's reunion under the clock tower.  The dialogue is different than the book, but the emotion is the same.  For over 6 Months, both had been completely dead inside.  Once back in each others arms, both were alive again.

The ending has the Volturi threatening them if Bella doesn't become a Vampire.  The Wolves threatening to kill them if she does become a Vampire.  Edward still thinking she's better off as a Human.  And neither Bella nor Edward really cared about any of that.  All that mattered was they together.

3733057,1,B001OQCV5G,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

3733061,2,B001OQCV5G,In my opinion this is the worse movie in the Twilight collection. The movie is a little drawn out and can be slow. Not near as exciting as the book itself. Bella spends most of her time doing things that are reckless with the hopes of seeing Edward. After many attempts she almost dies...enter Edward. I will still keep the movie because I am in love with anything Twilight but I probably want be watching it very often.,1463443200,,420,4.397435897435898

She doesn't always say the book was better. Sometimes she likes the movie better. In this case, she thought they complemented each other. The movie follows the book closely. It has to condense some for time allowed, that why so many movies are cut up in two parts these days. The YA genre is full of paranormal romance. This story was a refreshing spin off the usual formula of teen angst with supernatural/futuristic elements. I have to say, that I watched it too and while I wasn't as engrossed in it as my girlfriend was, it was easy to follow, well-written, and had a strong leading player. I recommend this movie whether you have read the book or not.",1458000000,3,791,4.387755102040816
