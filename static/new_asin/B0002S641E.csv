8031191,3,B0002S641E,"The performance is OK but the sound, image and overall presentation is lackluster. Not really recommended but you might enjoy it. Probably made a number of years with poor (by today's standards) technology.",1419638400,,206,5.2727272727272725
8031192,5,B0002S641E,"Without having see this I gave the DVD's to several friends for Christmas.  I was delighted when I was able to view it, I was delighted to see what a wonderful presentation it is.  Music and art at Christmas, and from the Met Museum.  What could be a better combination?",1396483200,2,270,4.36
8031193,5,B0002S641E,"Excellent choice of carols from the ancient and unfamiliar to the most hackneyed, all in superb sound and excellent video. Conducting is exemplary. Subtitles are provided and will be necessary for most of the audience. Solo work is mostly from the superb Aled Jones with a memorable Boar's Head Carol from Gerald Finley. Highly recommended without hesitaation.",1345334400,4,360,5.333333333333333
8031194,5,B0002S641E,"A truly wonderful and beautiful performance of favorite Christmas carols. The video source is older, but still clear and colorful. And the singing is glorious.",1261785600,2,159,5.4
8031195,2,B0002S641E,"I consider Willcock's Carols For Christmas CD one of the finest ever recorded, and I even own the companion book from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So, why not a DVD of a performance tied into the same material?

Alas, the video is not even high quality for the standards of the time. Some of the songs don't even have the video and audio synchronized. So, stick to CD recordings of David Willcocks plus anyone, but I can't recommend the DVD here.",1229385600,7,449,4.475609756097561
