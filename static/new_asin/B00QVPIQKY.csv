6889055,4,B00QVPIQKY,"Full Moon Features continues to push out their classic catalog on Blu-ray with the release of Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth. Charles Band takes the reins again on this energetic and enjoyable follow-up to his original 1984 cult film. Just don't expect the same hard-boiled noir feel as the first or youll be disappointed.

Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth sees our heroic trooper (Tim Thomerson) returning again to save a Los Angeles commodities broker from zombies. Things get complicated when his wife (Megan Ward) from the future is sent back to help him. His wife in the present, Lena (Helen Hunt), is none too happy to see her. Jack is now stuck balancing two women and trying to destroy a sinister plot involving Trancers.

Its amazing that Band could bring together most of the cast from the first Trancers to reprise their roles. A lot can happen in seven years and Helen Hunt was about to blow up big-time on TV and the big screen. On top of that, he added impressive newcomers Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, and Bond girl Martine Beswick to the mix.

Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth is rated R for adult situations, violence and gore, profanity, smoking and drinking, and frightening and intense scenes. If released today, the movie would be PG-13 at the most. Theres some blood-splattering when the Trancers are shot, but nothing more since they then disintegrate in a flash of light. Adult situations are made up of some kissing and talk.

Full Moon Features always does their best to give fans what they want when it comes to bonus material and their Blu-ray release of Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth is no different. Special features include audio commentary by Tim Thomerson, Megan Ward, and Charles Band. We also get the original VideoZone featurette for the movie, a rare blooper reel, and a rare photo gallery.

Sci-Fi actioner Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth makes the most of a low budget through its setting in the past and minimal need for special effects. The look of the title beasties is accomplished through practical make-up and the only need for VFX comes when the monsters evaporate in a haze of laser lighting. Writers Jackson Barr and Charles Band build an engaging story through the use of a bizarre love triangle, humor, drama, and adventure. Although this sequel doesnt hold quite the same charm as the original, it stands on its own and successfully continues the saga of Jack Deth.",1424822400,4,2461,4.767605633802817
6889056,4,B00QVPIQKY,"** I received a free review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Last year, I had the pleasure of reviewing one of Full Moons science fiction classics on Blu-ray, TRANCERS.  This was a real treat because I had never seen the movie prior to reviewing it, and I got to enjoy all of its glory in HD.  Now, Full Moon has opened the vault once again and released the sequel, TRANCERS 2: THE RETURN OF JACK DETH.  And while I honestly didn't enjoy it as much as its predecessor, it is still a great film and a lot of fun.

I really like the whole TRANCERS concept, especially how the series handles time travel.  So many movies fail because they try to address the paradoxical aspects of time travel, only to muck it up by creating more paradoxes.  TRACERS doesnt really bother messing with it, instead focusing on the here-and-now of the film.  This works well, too, because the viewer then doesnt have to exert a lot of mental energy trying to sort things out.

TRANCERS 2: THE RETURN OF JACK DETH is shot fairly well and looks pretty good from a production standpoint, but it doesnt have the darker, gritty feel like the first one.  This might stem from the fact the sequel was made roughly seven years after the first, and Band probably had a more modest budget.  More money equals a cleaner looking film.  This isn't a negative, but more of an observation.

The acting is just as solid, with Tim Thomerson reprising his role as the titular hero and Helen Hunt portraying his now-wife.  They are joined this time by Megan Ward, who plays Deths wife from the future, and Alyson Croft, who portrays the ancestor of McNulty.  The primary cast does a great jobhowever the extras all leave something to be desired.  This is to be expected, however, given the low budget of the movie.  Screen vets and horror icons Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton also have nice cameos, which helps to round out the cast.

My sole complaint about the film is that some of the dialogue seems forced.  Im not sure why this struck me so much, but it is the only thing that keeps this from being a great film.  Dont get me wrongits still very good.  But it could have been better.

Still, TRANCERS 2: THE RETURN OF JACK DETH is a big win for me, and fans of Full Moon will want to snatch this up on Blu-ray ASAP.  In addition to HD quality sound and picture, youll get brand new special features (that were not available on the DVD), including:

-Audio commentary by Tim Thomerson, Megan Ward, and Charles Band
-Original VideoZone making-of featurette
-Rare blooper reel
-Rare photo gallery
-5.1 surround sound

This is available now, so make a note!",1421798400,3,2639,4.493697478991597

6889058,5,B00QVPIQKY,"Scrap the Old Fullscreen dvd release of TRANCERS II
the wait is over the sequel to the low budget sci-fi classic is on blu-ray now for the first time ever in WIDESCREEN
and the new High Definition transfer does look beautiful in 1:78:1 Widescreen, not much Grain at all
massive improvement from the fullscreen format
plus a new 5.1 surround sound mix has been added, this new 5.1 sound is a big improvement from the stereo mix
the Team at Full moon Direct did an amazing Job with the blu-ray transfer & the sound quality
very clean & crisp picture quality, the sound quality is boosted up to i couldn't believe it, i was amazed.

plus new special features & the old extras from the DVD release have been added to this blu-ray release
all new Audio commentary with Tim thomerson, Megan ward & Charles band as they give recollections making TRANCERS II
i noticed with the new commentary from the first TRANCERS blu-ray
Charles band had difficulty remembering scenes he filmed
Tim thomerson had to keep reminding him about scenes he had filmed
well sadly this new commentary for TRANCERS II is no Different
it seems like Charles band wasn't even interested to watch the film & give recollections
or maybe he was a little interested i guess
but he kept saying he didn't remember filming this scene or that scene cause it was a long time ago
and he had moved on
again Tim thomerson had to remind him about most scenes from the film
from a fans point of view i found disapointing
Megan ward had a great time watching the film and recalling alot of scenes.
after watching it with the commentary i wasn't impressed but that's my opinion.
i think a new retrospective making of featurette with Megan ward, tim thomerson, Charles band
would have been more beneficial
but for some reason it wasn't done only a new Audio commentary for the film has been recorded
well Actress's Helen Hunt & Alyson croft are not interviewed, they're not in the new commentary either
i think Alyson croft was busy doing a TV series when the commentary was recorded
otherwise she may have been on the commentary
i don't know why Helen Hunt didn't join in the commentary maybe she did not want to or wasn't available

but the original video zone making of featurette which is behind the scenes on the set footage of the film during 1990 is on this blu-ray only goes for 15mins but still interesting to watch
and a rare Photo Gallery has been added
plus the old trailer for the film has been given a new HD widescreen transfer aswell
the blooper reel from the DVD release is here

scrap the old dvd release, time for an upgrade get this new blu-ray release it's ALL REGIONS to
so U.K. & AUS buyers can buy the blu-ray aswell
5 stars i gave it based a new 1:78:1 widescreen transfer, worth the cash for sure.
now TRANCERS III & IV need to be reissued on blu-ray with new special features
maybe that will happen sometime in 2015",1419206400,14,2892,4.504761904761905

6889062,5,B00QVPIQKY,"One of my favorite movies growing up. Psyched to see it outside of the box set but I am hoping a re-master follows this release. Some 5.1, a feature length commentary (with Charles Band of course) and a complete Videozone would be awesome. The picture and sound quality of this DVD puts any VHS copy to shame.

8693116,5,B00QVPIQKY,"Good story line, is congruent with first Trancers film. Tim Thomerson, although not a household name, is a good actor and does a good  job of making his character likable and realistic. I enjoyed the first Trancers film enough to purchase Trancers II and was not disappointed. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan you may enjoy this film because it has a good storyline and is well acted for a B movie.",1472688000,,398,4.378378378378378

8693118,5,B00QVPIQKY,"the trancers series was a video hit back in the 80's. It also had a limited theatrical release I believe.  Helen Hunt who would go on to win a an oscar is a young actor in this series. And she does a great job here. There's a lot of humor in these films too.  this one is as fun as the first one and now i'ts on blu ray. The blu ray looks much better than my old laser disc version. I had all five on that format!  Only 3 of the six are out on blu ray though.  Trancers features a man who travels back in time to inhabit his ancient ancestor.  He does this to battle his evil fores who are also from the future and addicted to the evil drug trance.  Much like todays meth heads who become rotting monsters , these trancers are dangerous and vile.  So lets hope they put out the rest of the series  on blu ray too.",1461974400,,813,3.8848484848484848
