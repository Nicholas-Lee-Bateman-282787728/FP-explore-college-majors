2817537,4,B000PE0GXC,"One lazy Sunday I drifted into watching this mini-series. My first impression was that it was a silly, romanticized Hollywood treatment of a classic historical account (admittedly, one that I hadn't personally read at the time).

And, yes, seeing Brian Dennehy cast as Kublai Khan made it especially hard to buy into the treatment! But the sets, costumes and storyline were all quite extraordinary. A lot of effort obviously went into the production , which was made in China with a substantial budget.

But many things just didn't sit right with me: the magnificence of Kublai Kahn's court, his cities, the military technology, and a romance between Marco and a Chinese princess? And then the Kahn charges Marco with delivering the princess to the other side of the planet???

I watched it to the end...and then ran to Amazon to find a book to get the facts. The book I found was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Edited-by-Peter-Harris-Everyman-s-Library-Cloth/dp/0307269132/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Travels of Marco Polo: Edited by Peter Harris (Everyman's Library (Cloth))</a>.

Amazing news...this ""sensationalized"" mini-series barely scratches the surface of the astounding things Marco Polo reports in his 700 year old tale of travel!

His adventures, many of which are dramatized in this DVD, seemed absolutely unbelievable...until I found most of them proven true in the book... including the story about delivering the princess.

And the romance? Well, I suspect that Marco left quite a few personal facts out of his life in China. So kudos to the scriptwriters who wrote a little love between the lines of his historic journey.

Bottom line - a great film for couples or anyone with an interest in history.

If you just watch the film, marvel that there's more truth in this account than there is fiction! And if you want to know the truth, treat yourself to the book.",1243123200,40,1952,5.440397350993377
2817538,1,B000PE0GXC,"""realistic"" ? ""true story"" ? oh come oooooon......Marco Polo's journey, together with his father and brother(and not alone) was a business venture, he didn't set out to convert the Khan(a man his father knew since he'd been there before..), neither did it have anything to do with priests or monks on a journey to convert the ""idolators"" ...this film his about as accurate as Gary Cooper's in the 1930's....history is so marvellous yet americans seem to believe it is far too complicated for anyone of us to comprehend, so they simplify it into clich's(many of them purveyed by movies in the first place)ask a pretty boy to prance through asia and let an irishman play Kublai Khan....on second thought : I prefer the Gary Cooper film, at least tht one wasn't pretentious in his supposed ""truthfullness""....",1229817600,8,806,4.9338235294117645
2817539,2,B000PE0GXC,"Two reviews come to mind for this one: 1) ""Low budget, low energy, big yawn""; and, 2) ""Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan.""  They tried, others have tried, no one's done justice to M. Polo since M. Polo first told his story.  This one throws in some sex and B.D. Wong gets a martial arts airing. Two stars, one for each review.",1206403200,3,321,4.245901639344262
2817540,4,B000PE0GXC,"Understanding that this person, Marco Polo, may never have seen China as he said he did, I fully enjoyed this story. It was very believable as well as interesting.",1206316800,4,163,4.655172413793103
2817541,4,B000PE0GXC,"The movie was a  well made re telling  of the story of Marco Polo. However such a story would take hours to tell on screen as much was left out ,however all in all i would recomend this movie .",1204588800,8,193,3.8
2817542,4,B000PE0GXC,"I enjoyed the picture a lot. Great views, handsome and talented actors. Still I prefer the style where strong scenes are suggested, leaving some of the action to the imagination.",1203984000,3,178,4.966666666666667
2817543,5,B000PE0GXC,This mini series is very close to the one in the early 80's that was the best ever made. I would definitely recommend this to lovers of history.,1187740800,18,144,4.178571428571429

2817546,4,B000PE0GXC,Researchers found that Marco Polo is a terrible liar. He never come to China and all the story is a fabricated lies. The Most famous book The travels of marco polo is written by his cellmate. That's fun.,1426204800,,203,4.368421052631579
2817547,4,B000PE0GXC,"I thought this would be like the series, its ok, kind of slow and drags on, the seller is great, great price just not a great movie",1425513600,,131,3.888888888888889
2817548,4,B000PE0GXC,good movie,1425254400,,10,4.5
2817549,4,B000PE0GXC,"This has the look of an after school special with acting to match; however, I have to confess to being drawn into the story. To think that it's TRUE that a Venetian went to CHINA in the 1300s and explored all that unknown, unmapped territory. It must have been an incredible adventure to see so many weird and wonderful things. It definitely inspires the traveler in me. I enjoyed the story.

One comment though- why Brian Dennehy as Khan? Actually, he holds his own, but it doesn't work visually. It's a very strange choice.",1423699200,,525,4.585106382978723

2817554,3,B000PE0GXC,"This was somewhat entertaining, but the acting didn't seem to be up there with the visuals.  Speaking for both my wife and myself, I think ""Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan"" ??? just about says it all.",1394668800,,197,4.472222222222222

2817557,5,B000PE0GXC,"The movie showed how hard times were at that time in history .
The explorers were a special kind of people and felt deeply about
themselves, their relationships and other aspects in their lives.

The movie came in great shape and in a prompt manner.
The price was great.
I would recommend this site to anyone. Especially History buffs.",1365379200,,335,4.677966101694915
2817558,2,B000PE0GXC,"Some of you may remember the old Howard Hughes movie The Congueror. The punchline of that movie is that Hughes chose John Wayne to play Genghis Khan. Of course that was at a time when American film makers routinely picked white actors to play Asians or Native Americans (Peter Lorre playing Mr. Moto and David Carridine playing a Shaolin Buddhist monk) We haven't seen many caucasians cast in Asian roles in the last few years. Marco Polo is about the only exception I can think of. The producers chose beefy ex-rugby player and former Marine BRIAN DENNEHY as Mongolian-Chinese emperor Kubla Khan. Every time Dennehy appeared on screen I thought of John Wayne playing Kubla's grandfather. While Dennehy seems like a bit of a ham fisted choice, he was far more interesting than leading actor Ian Samerholder who managed to breath little life into his role. The backdrops for this movie are beautiful, but the videography (it clearly looks like it was shot on video) was workmanlike but un-inspiring. Marco Polo is a very small interpretation of an epic journey.",1339804800,,1060,4.894444444444445
2817559,5,B000PE0GXC,Great movie with lots of adventure. The movie is over three hours long and keeps you entertained during the entire movie.  Also it provides you a little history lesson.,1338163200,,168,4.793103448275862
2817560,5,B000PE0GXC,"The movie was a great find! The price was excellent.  It came still in the original packaging, unopened.  It is an adventurous and historically accurate movie. Great family film, but one scene is a bit unappropriate.",1325289600,,216,4.972222222222222
2817561,5,B000PE0GXC,We missed the second half of Marco Polo on TV so I was excited when I found it at Amazon. We don't have many DVD's but this is a part of history so we've watched it twice so far. So much to learn of a mysterious culture. I would recomend it to any history buff.,1300752000,,261,3.7636363636363637
2817562,3,B000PE0GXC,"I enjoyed the colorful pageantry of this mini-series. Keeping in mind this is Hollywood and not a documentary, this romanticized version of Marco Polo's travels was most entertaining. Ian Somerhalder is well cast as the ever inquisitive adventurer as are the other members of the international cast. With one exception, Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan? Though a fine actor in his own right, Mr. Dennehy has no business portraying the Mongol ruler. Not to mention the scores of Asians offended by such casting. However, the sets were most glamorous making this production a worthwhile adventure.",1286668800,7,591,5.231578947368421
2817563,3,B000PE0GXC,"There are several reviews that discuss the historical accuracy of this film, but my review of Hallmark's made for TV movie, Marco Polo is based mostly on its entertainment value.

The sets and costumes were very nice, but the story was very slow paced and became tedious to watch.  Some of the fighting scenes were good and it was interesting to see B.D. Wong (""Pedro"") performing martial arts.

Historically, Kublai Khan wished to meet with Marco Polo because he had never seen a European before.  The casting of Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan was a poor decision.  It's offensive enough seeing a Caucasian actor in an Asian role, but on top of that, his acting was painfully bad.

I suppose seeing this movie might get some people interested in reading Marco Polo's book and learning more about that part of history.  Probably more interesting than watching this made for TV movie.",1262908800,6,881,4.7947019867549665
