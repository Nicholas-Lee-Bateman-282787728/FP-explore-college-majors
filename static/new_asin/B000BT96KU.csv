Lots of action, good moral values, and interesting plots. Kids back during this era went to the movies to watch these icon heroes. They probably dreamed that someday they could meet at least one of them in person. Johnny Mac Brown, Hop a Long Cassidy, and Buck Jones are some of these B western actors.

8092156,4,B000BT96KU,"""Flaming Frontiers"" is a 15 chapter Universal serial, the third with Johnny Mack Brown, released in 1938.  It was directed by Ray Taylor and Alan James, with story and screenplay by Wyndham Gittens, George Plympton, Basil Dickey and Paul Perez, ""suggested by 'The Tie that Binds' by Peter B. Kyne,"" according to the credits.

The plot involves an attempt by Bart Eaton (James Blaine) to take over a gold mine owned by Tom Grant (Ralph Bowman, later known as John Archer) by the rather doubtful plan of marrying Tom's sister, Mary (Eleanor Hansen) and then having Tom murdered.  Eaton has been intercepting Tom's mail, so Mary has no idea that her brother struck it rich.  If Bart Eaton's methods weren't obvious enough, he is hampered by the arrival of Tom's friend, the famous scout Tex Houston (Johnny Mack Brown) who helps Mary stay out of Eaton's grasp.

Johnny Mack Brown's serials contain plenty of action, and if they also include many Indian attacks from Universal's silent film collection, this one has some unusual plot twists, including a tribe of friendly Indians, with Tex aided by the Chief's son, Thunder Cloud (Chief Thundercloud).  And Bart Eaton, after some success in his villainy during the first few chapters, finds himself at odds with his associate, saloon owner Ace Daggett (Charles Middleton) who also wants to take over Tom Grant's gold mine.  There are henchmen aplenty, including Charles Stevens, Ed Cassidy, Roy Barcroft, William Royle, Charles King and Slim Whittaker, and their allegiance is divided between the two bosses.  It's enough to sustain interest, when watched with a day or so between the chapters.

Amazon lists two DVD editions, from VCI and Alpha, plus VCI's old edition on VHS.  All three are from reissue prints with replacement ""next week"" titles and the main opening title over a still-frame background with copyright by Serials Incorporated.  This serial was the one that introduced Universal's well-known back-slanting, scrolling chapter Forewords, and the same technique was used for the opening credits.

VCI's DVD edition, # 8442 is on two discs.  Sharpness, gray scale and framing are first rate, likely from a 35mm print, and the sound is clear and reasonably free of noise and distortion.  The ""next week"" titles are not the originals, but at least they contain the title of the next chapter, the only place these were shown.  While VCI's DVD is the best of the available editions, its total running time is about four minutes shorter than the other two, out of a total length of nearly five hours.  Most of the missing material is in short pieces, likely due to splices and not especially significant.  In a couple chapters, at the start of the ""Foreword,"" the text has already scrolled to near the top of the screen.  But there's a fairly serious omission, a full minute is gone at the end of Chapter Eleven, including the cliffhanger, where a wagon goes over a cliff, and this same event is absent in the ""resolution"" at the start of the next chapter.  Of less importance, the opening titles are not all true to the originals.  They were ""restored"" from the Chapter Ten titles, with MPPDA certificate number 4163, which isn't a big issue except for the first three chapters, where pictures of the primary cast members were included with their credits.  These have been patched in, but instead of a ""Supporting Cast"" list we get ""The Players"" from the later chapters, lacking seven names including Roy Barcroft.  And since it has been a subject of impassioned discussion in other reviews, I need to mention that VCI's logo occasionally appears, though barely visible; I didn't notice this on initial viewing.  I finally saw one in the lower-left corner, 16:37 into Chapter Fourteen, looking like a little lens flare.

""Extras"" are a ""Cliffhanger Poster Gallery"" with eight pictures; ""Biographies"" of Johnny Mack Brown, Ralph Bowman and Ray Taylor; and trailers, for ""The Oregon Trail,"" ""Winners of the West"" and ""Tim Tyler's Luck,"" plus one running only 40 seconds for ""Riders of Death Valley.""

The other two editions appear to be from similar sources, if not necessarily the same print.

Alpha's DVD, # 4951D is on a single disc, the image none too sharp, the sound weak, distorted and muffled, though both improve somewhat in the later chapters.  The ""next week"" titles have been replaced by a generic ""Don't Miss Our Next Exciting Episode"" lacking the chapter titles.  But Chapter Eleven has the cliffhanger missing from VCI's DVD, and while also afflicted with the Serials Incorporated still-frame main title, in addition to Alpha's logo in the corner, the credits are from the chapters to which they are attached, with the ""Supporting Players"" shown for the first three chapters following the ""mug shots"" of the main cast, and with the original edit of the title music, slightly different between the first and second chapters.  Still, the main virtue of this release is its low cost.

VCI's old VHS edition, # 1745 is nearly identical to Alpha's in content, but at least on the copy I have the sharpness and gray scale are fairly good, and it is almost possible to read the small MPPDA certificate numbers.  VHS quality may vary with individual copies, and the second tape of my set has more trouble with highlights washing out than seen in the earlier chapters.  But the sound is better than Alpha's, and there is no logo in the corner during the credits.

This is a good serial, and despite my complaints about VCI's DVD I think it is worth Amazon's 4-star ""I Like It"" rating.  Alpha's edition is only about a third the cost of VCI's, and while a little closer to the original serial, the image and sound quality are no better than that cost difference would suggest.  But like most serials, the plot is redundant; leave some time between chapters.",1356307200,2,5816,4.887983706720978
8092157,5,B000BT96KU,"Just finished watching this 15-chapter five hour serial and boy did it pass quickly! That's because it's action-packed and filled with interesting characters. Johnny Mack Brown made several of these UNIVERSAL serials in the 1930's and they're all very good and you should try to get as many as possible as they're mostly offered from VCI ENTERTAINMENT (OREGON TRAIL, RUSTLERS OF RED DOG) and look just perfect. FLAMING FRONTIERS has great definition, background depth (you can see the river shimmer and flow in the background as badguy Charlie King ponders the next outlaw move) and a general overall sharpness and clarity that is really quite outstanding for a 1930's serial!...No plot synopsis here for a 15-chapter serial. All you need to know is that the VCI version is THE ONE to get. Great serial, great product.",1337558400,,818,5.022058823529412
8092158,1,B000BT96KU,"With respect to Mr. Lovins, his review about the VCI release is excellent. But the DVD on this page is the Alpha Video release and NOT the VCI release. This Alpha Video release is heavily compressed to less than two GBs and worse, the opening and closing credits are freeze-framed, the company superimposed their logo in the corner. In other words, if you are a purist, don't buy this DVD. Quality isn't very good and it's been seriously altered. The same serial is available from VCI (also being sold on Amazon.com) and you'd do better buying the better quality.",1326672000,7,563,4.696969696969697

Great job by VCI Entertainment for releasing ""Flaming Frontiers"" (1938), the digital transfere with a clean, clear and crisp print...looking forward to more high quality releases from the vintage serial era of the '30s, '40s & '50s...order your copy now from Amazon or VCI Entertainment where there are plenty of copies available on DVD and VHS, stay tuned once again for top notch action mixed with deadly adventure from the ""King of Serials"" VCI...just the way we like 'em
