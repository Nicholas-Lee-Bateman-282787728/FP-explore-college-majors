8466623,5,B001E96KD2,I took this class in person many years back and I swear by the method. If you follow thru that is! If you simply watch and do not follow thru then it is pointless!,1503619200,,163,3.823529411764706
8466624,4,B001E96KD2,Vivian Brault's Tearless Discipline method is great!  The trick is implementing the techniques that she teaches.  I would definitely recommend the DVDs... they got me through some tough times with my son.,1331683200,,204,5.34375
8466625,1,B001E96KD2,"This product will give you some good parenting skills.  The information is not bad.  The reason we scored it so low is that there are cheaper products that do a much better job.  I highly recommend ""Parenting with Love and Logic"" or to a lesser extent, ""Positive Discipline"".  Don't waste your money on ""Tearless"" - you'll be spending more than you have to on a product that doesn't do as good a job.",1226275200,,400,4.438356164383562
