2630034,5,B000H6SY14,"Sorry, but I don't understand some of the previous comparisons with the ""Original"" show. This IS the show I saw a few times on the stupid Fox channel. Unfortunately Fox canceled this amazing series before it had aired all episodes, and I had been clued in after the fourth had been shown and disappeared. The stupid Fox network then showed reruns at dinnertime!!! I guess they saw puppets and assumed it was a kids' show. Perhaps ""stupid"" is too mild a term. It is NOT a kids' show, but a fantastic adult comedy which features ""Fabricated Americans"" interacting with ""Humans"" in a matter-of-fact way that is hilarous.

If you like comedy, and either grew up with the likes of ""Sesame Street"" or watched it with your own kids, don't miss this! I bought the DVD as soon as it was announced, and have thoroughly enjoyed it.",1169683200,3,820,4.616438356164384
2630035,3,B000H6SY14,"This Greg the Bunny was okay and got a few laughs, but it wasn't nearly as good as the series.  We were a little disappointed because we watched the series first.  If we'd watched them in the other order, it probably would've rated better with us.  Also, if you are unfamiliar with the movies that are parodied, it's not very funny.  You have to know the references.",1168473600,2,366,4.417910447761194
2630036,5,B000H6SY14,"I have the Fox series as well, and this DVD is so much better. I really like unedited humor though, hence my added enjoyment. The best parts are the commentaries and interviews. I bought 5 of these to give out as Christmas presents. IFC has a winner with this, it is only too bad more people don't know about it.

I definitely recommend it and all other Greg The Bunny stuff.",1167782400,2,375,4.28169014084507
2630037,5,B000H6SY14,"Greg the Bunny might as well be nicknamed ""Energizer"" - he just keeps going and going.  The Greg the Bunny show started on cable access, graduated to pay cable with a short interstitial show on IFC, then moved to network on Fox (the other DVD available on Amazon), and finally back to IFC with more shorts.  This DVD is a compilation of some of the best of the pre- and post-Fox film parodies.  If you like your puppets twisted with a pinch of pathos, this is a must-get.  Just don't let your kids watch it.",1162339200,7,507,4.3052631578947365
2630038,2,B000H6SY14,"I'm sorry to report this is just a pale shadow of the original TV show (which was amazing). This one apparently had next to no budget, and none of the fabulous human actors (Seth Green, Eugene Levy etc) which made Greg The Bunny so funny and textured. Instead it feels like they just sat down and improvised the whole thing.",1161820800,4,324,4.416666666666667
2630039,5,B000H6SY14,"Greg the Bunny returns in this two disc collection of his parody series on IFC> If you are a fan of the FOX series or just Greg in general, then you will want this collection. It has many many funny moments, but it definitely ISN'T for the young. It is nothing like the FOX series when it comes to content. Not only does it have drug use and nudity, it has a heaping helping of cusing. Overall, if you are a fan of the FOX series, this is a have to have only if you aren't offended by adult material. My favorite sketch is the Pulp Fiction parody. They are great!",1157932800,21,563,4.081081081081081
2630050,5,B000H6SY14,"Saw the series and had to get the parodies too... dark and funny. Very, VERY wrong in so many ways... I laughed myself stupid...",1370390400,,128,4.375
2630051,1,B000H6SY14,"LOVE Greg the Bunny (the show)
I don't feel the same way about this travesty though.
Inferior writing and poor voice talent.
The cheap production is hardly gallant.

How about a haiku review

Has a few high points
and Greg the Bunny is there
but you should skip it",1242691200,2,288,4.76
2630052,5,B000H6SY14,"I felt emense sadness when the original fox tv show Greg the Bunny was cancelled!  Then it came to my attention that there was more to be seen.  This volume of film parodies is inovative and hilarious at the same time!  I also purchased the other volume of film parodies and highly enjoyed it as well.  If you need a good laugh and enjoy puppetry give these a watch, you won't regret it, blah!",1238198400,,393,4.27027027027027
2630053,3,B000H6SY14,"This is exactly what I expected it to be; Funny as hell in places, but too inconsistent to warrant a higher score.",1191369600,,114,4.2272727272727275
2630054,4,B000H6SY14,"But this is not for children! Take this advice to heart this is not anything like the Fox series with the exception of some characters.

Now on the actual review:

It is a great compilation of some of the greatest film parodies my favorites being Martian Serum Seven From Mars (Ed Wood),The Godpappy (The Godfather),Ya Know For Kids! (Fargo), Daddyhood (Eraserhead), and Dead Puppet Storage (Pulp Fiction).

Despite what many people think and as one reviewer put it just a pale shadow of the ""original tv show"". Actually IFC first came up with GTB  and sold it to Fox then Fox tanked it and IFC brought it back...This actually has  episodes of the Original show from IFC like the 13th step Blah and so forth.

All in all great DVD great show...the only reason I gave it a 4 was because they should've really put the 30 min. special where they brought the show back...the vegas comeback as I call it.",1189296000,3,899,4.552795031055901
2630055,5,B000H6SY14,"I quickly became a fan of the Greg The Bunny show, and was disappointed by the quick canelation of it. When I read one of the earlier reviews of this DVD, I decided to check it out. Best decision that I could have made. If you like the TV series, and wished that they could have taken it farther, then you will love this bizarre collection of episodes. You will not be sorry.",1186963200,,375,4.1506849315068495
2630056,4,B000H6SY14,"This is a nice collection, but it's a shame that it's only a 'best of' and not the entire series.  It would be nice to have had the public access shows from the early days on here as a bonus, as well.",1185235200,,200,3.761904761904762
2630057,3,B000H6SY14,"Overall, not a bad collection of shorts. Doesn't quite pick up where 'Greg the Bunny' left off, but considering that each segment is designed as a parody, it's understandable.

It's good to see the Puppish dream hasn't withered way entirely.",1183075200,,241,5.025
2630058,5,B000H6SY14,"Best comedy on television, EVER!  Do yourself a favor and buy it.",1178323200,,65,4.416666666666667
2630059,2,B000H6SY14,"Since when did network constraints actually foster MORE creativity? I'm an enormous fan of the original Greg the Bunny series, and found this new set of pseudo-parodies sophomoric and inconsistent by comparison. Too bad... the thinking behind this new collection seems to have been, ""It just gets funnier every time the F-bomb is dropped by a puppet, right?"" Sorry. There are a few unexpected glimpses of comic brilliance, but honestly this is not what I had hoped for as a follow up to such an amazing, clever, and original show.",1178064000,4,530,4.9

 ... there you can see executive-micromanage-sitcom-wannabe-bs ... IMHO

When they moved to IFC, they were left on their own (creatively) ... so ... much better, ... funny stuff.

Bring back Greg the Bunny (... and of course Warren) !!!",1472860800,,272,4.869565217391305

8137164,2,B000H6SY14,"Not as funny as the series; and I love Greg the Bunny. I really hate this DVD. OK maybe I am being too tough on the DVD. The problem is the DVD menu will not allow you to play all at one time so that each episode will automatically play after each other. Every DVD and Bluray I own except the two Greg the Bunny DVD's have either play the shows separately or chose ""Auto Play All""; and all shows will play one right after the other with no interruptions and no other input needed until all the episodes have finished. Other than this one critical design flaw I enjoyed the dvd's.",1454284800,,579,4.178571428571429

8137167,3,B000H6SY14,"Not the quality I expected after watching Warren the Ape and other productions by Seth Green and company.  To be fair though, the parodies were of movies that I hadn't seen so that may have had something to do with it.",1409443200,,218,4.317073170731708
