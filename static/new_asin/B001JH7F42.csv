3657885,5,B001JH7F42,"This subtitled film shows rarely seen panoramas of war-torn Lebanon alternating with beautiful landscape scenes following the end the Israeli-Hezbollah war of 2006.  As expected, the Arab viewpoint predominates, with minimal attention given to the antecedents of the conflict.  Hence, many of the title headings and most of the content are blatantly anti-Israel. Yet, some degree of even-handedness does manage to creep through.  Added to the political aspect is a pretty touching human interest story along with appealing lead characters which contribute to the viewing experience.  Recommended.",1246838400,3,596,5.816091954022989
3657886,5,B001JH7F42,"This is a movie that had to be done. Under the Bombs is unique. It can not be described as fiction because the background for the central plot is the cruel reality of another senseless war. It is not a documentary because two professional actors give a human face to the detached  portrayal of war that we so frequently see in the news. Both Nada Abou Farhat as well as George Khabbaz provide an authentic performance of the two central characters in the movie. The story revolves around Zeina, a mother searching for her missing sister and son, and Toni, a taxi driver trying to make ends meet in the simultaneously war ravaged and beautiful country of Lebanon. The realism is complete. The burials, the cries, the anger, the explosions, the ruined houses, and the destroyed bridges are all real. The filming was done under unique duress and dangerous circumstances. There is no cosmetic effort to moderate the ugliness of the senseless destruction of civilian property and lives or attempts to exaggerate or otherwise distort the events occurring in real time. The only thing that one can not feel watching this film is the stench of death. What should not be expected from this movie are the glorification of war, the gore, and the sensationalism of combat that is almost invariably the norm prevailing in Hollywood. This movie does not lecture the audience. It does not trivialize pain or take sides with any political point-of-view. It shows war for what it is: a total defeat of the human spirit. Sadly, the plot of this movie  is a mirror of what has been happening in too many parts in the world. Financial and economic devastation of the Western economies, millions of dead or displaced civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan,  Lebanon, Israel, the USA (remember 9/11) and a myriad of less known places are a testament to humanity's inability to overcome its greed and addiction to war. A movie like this should be shown in every school around the world. Maybe the  truthful scenes shown in 'Under the Bombs"" could counterbalance the culture of death propagated by the militaristic and ultra-nationalistic establishments of so many countries in this little planet. I clearly remember diplomats and politicians  in the awful summer of 2006 demanding a delay in the cease-fire so that a military ""solution"" could be reached. I hope (against all probability) that they will watch this movie. In one scene Zeina cries out: ""haidi mish harbi"", this is not my war. Maybe Zeina is wrong. The Israeli-Lebanese war of 2006, like all wars, is everybody's war.",1244937600,24,2587,4.910755148741419
3657887,5,B001JH7F42,"In the summer of 2006 Israel bombed southern Lebanon for 33 straight days, after which a cease fire was declared. 1189 people died and perhaps a million were made refugees. This film was shot on location after the cease-fire, and uses only two professional actors. Tony is a Christian taxi driver who takes Zeina, a Shiite who had been residing in Dubai, to find her son and sister. They search refugee centers, schools and convents, and end their improbable journey in a monastery where only the inanities of war could explain the bizarre conclusion. The film effectively takes you to the center of the war zone--bull dozers excavating mass graves, thumping helicopters deploying UN troops, bombed out roads and bridges, and the rubble and ruin of people's lives. ""Yes, the hatred keeps growing,"" says one young Lebanese mother, as she stands in front of a shell of a building that used to be her apartment. In Arabic with English subtitles.",1242345600,4,942,4.89375
3657888,5,B001JH7F42,"What a great movie!  This is a unique cinematic creation in that it is shot on the site in Lebanon immediately following the cease fire at the end of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.  There are no props, it's all real stuff.  There are only two professional actors in the movie, the rest are real folks, real ruins of war, real bombings and real suffering...

The film follows a story of a Shiite Muslim woman, Zeina, who lives abroad.  She and her unfaithful husband are estranged and while working out their marital problems they sent their only child to live back in southern Lebanon with Zeina's sister.  Then the war started and the south was heavily bombed during the conflict.  Some actual footage of the bombing is shown as caught with amateur camera.  Pretty devastating.  So Zeina returns from abroad via Turkey to Beirut and tried to find way to the south.  No one is willing to take her to the war zone despite the cease fire, except for a Christian taxi driver Toni.  They travel together taking detours around bombed bridges and blown up roads looking for Zeina's son.  They find her sister's house leveled to the ground and learn that she'd been killed in the collapse of the building.  They have some hope that the boy escaped unharmed and so they keep on driving and searching.

In the process of their searching, they come to confront their own past, their own demons and their own insecurities.  Amid all the depression and devastation they come to realize that they love southern Lebanon, the place of their upbringing and yearn and resolve to re-build it.  This is very symbolic as true re-building of Lebanon can truly be accomplished only as both the Christians and Muslims work hand in hand regardless of their religion.  The pain and suffering can indeed be overcome.  The climax is just beautiful and I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.",1236211200,8,1875,4.734567901234568
3657889,5,B001JH7F42,"A mother's search for her son in the immediate aftermath of Israel's 2006 bombing of Lebanon provides a vehicle for the viewer to see the destruction and hear from the victims firsthand. For some reason I had expected a somewhat detached semi-documentary, but instead this film drags you into the horrors of a senseless war in the desperate efforts to locate the missing son and sister. It is compelling, haunting, and especially relevant now that Israel is doing the exact same thing in Gaza.
Doubtlessly speaking for many of those caught in the crossfires, the lead actor laments, ""This is not MY war,"" as she seeks to understand the tragedy all around her.",1230681600,11,659,4.84070796460177

3657900,3,B001JH7F42,"Poor acting, poor dialogue, boring. Great scenery, somewhat thought provoking.

The acting is really poor. the subject matter, and story are telegraphed. From the first 30 mins, you can tell what the rest of the movie is going to be about. The story is very cliche. Not original and not subtle at all.

This is a movie that's basically trying to say; ""The 2006 war with Israel killed many innocent civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure. Innocent people just want to live their lives and be happy and not to be pawns in a game between foreign powers. People love their land/culture and want to live & die in their own land."" this is the greater message. I do like the message. I just didn't like the delivery.

The story starts to go down the drain from the very beginning when the main character, shows up in a bright clubbing dress showing lots of cleavage, wanting a taxi driver to take her to South Lebanon to look for her son!!!! Very implausible. Throughout the movie, her acting, and her relationship with the taxi driver with the background of her missing son and killed sister is somewhat disturbing and unbelievable for a conservative society in Middle East. The sexual innuendos are just too much to take and so inappropriate for that setting.

After the first 20 to 30 minutes, I couldn't wait for the movie to run through its un-original course and be over with. Very cheesy and unimaginative.",1432598400,,1415,4.716599190283401

The plot centers on a mother looking for her child, who was staying with an aunt when the war started. Remarkably, the film incorporates images from real events, with concise direction and editing. Despite the harrowing images of senseless destruction and human loss, the movie is compulsively watchable, with a plot that keeps you guessing until the end.

3657909,4,B001JH7F42,"First things first, I am a huge fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies (so much so that I recently finally entered a subscription to the one movie a month). I am still catching up on older Film Movement releases and not long ago fell upon this one in the foreign movie section of my local library.

""Under the Bombs"" (2007 release from Lebanon; 98 min.) brings the story of Zeina, a Lebanese Muslim woman who has just returned to Lebanon to pick up her 6 yr. old son, whom she sent there to spend the summer with Zeina's sister. As it happens, the story takes place just at the tail end of the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict in the summer of 2006. Zeina needs a cab to get to South Lebanon, and she finds Tony, a Lebanese Christian who offers his services. To give more away from the plot would ruin your viewing experience.  Please note that the movie was shot ""on the fly"" as events were happening in real time in South Lebanon.

At heart, this is a road movie, pure and simple. In fact for some reason this reminded me of Apocalypse Now, in which Captain Willard's journey on the river Nung becomes stranger and ultimately surreal as the movie progresses and the utter madness of war becomes obvious to anyone. Same is true here. The performances of Nada Aby Farat (as Zeina) and Georges Khabbaz (as Tony) are nothing short of outstanding. They are the only professional actors appearng in the movie. Beware, there are several harrowing scenes that are not for the faint of heart, in particular at the very beginning and the very end of the movie. In all, a brave and worthy movie, as much so for the movie itself as for the circumstances within which the movie was made.",1339891200,,1692,4.46925566343042

3657911,5,B001JH7F42,"A look from the other side

Network TV likes to show war at a distance--smoke billowing from a distant hillside, a devastated apartment block, burned out vehicles - but rarely deals with the loss of the people on the ground. ""Under the Bombs"" is an exercise in changing the dynamic, showing what life is like for one Lebanese family during the war of 2006. The story is simple - a distraught mother is looking for her lost child, and is aided by a taxi driver who will help her for cash.  Inevitably, the characters learn to sympathize with each other as they navigate the desolate, war-blasted landscape following clues, dodging militias and beseeching foreign aid workers.

Telling much more than this would spoil the plot. But ""Under the Bombs"" shows situations and characters that are believable and that tug the heartstrings. Tony is a man's man, by turns brooding angel and horndog. Zeina is a mother focused on finding her son, but also beset by the guilt of her divorce. Together, they drive along the thin edge of hope and hopelessness, attempting to find small victories in a sea of death, despair and confusion. His is not a political movie, except that it shows that Muslim Lebanese as sympathetic and human. A well-crafted and deeply affecting film.",1318896000,,1262,4.806451612903226
3657912,5,B001JH7F42,"This is a very interesting movie that was shot on location in Lebanon around the time of the action depicted in the film. The views of the destruction and desperation alone are unique enough to make the movie worthwhile. This is a war story and ultimately a story of the frustration that people engulfed in the Israeli-Arab struggle can feel. The main character is a women with various personal issues who was out of the country at the time of the action but who had left her son with members of her family only to have him disappear in the chaos. In the movie she returns to look for her son and is helped by an unscrupulous but in many ways, well-meaning taxi driver. As they roam the south looking for her son we meet various victims of the violence and see many scenes of desperation and frustration. As a movie in general, I would say this one is OK, but the setting makes the whole thing much better. This is sort of a real-life view of what we often hear about on the news, but rarely see or experience for ourselves. I don't know if it will be remembered as a classic, but it will probably long be considered an important film because of the setting.",1310688000,,1158,4.341013824884793

One sees the physical and family carnage brought home, what it means to be suddenly sundered from Home, loved ones, and often instantly orphaned -- through no fault of your own.

My husband is Lebanese, from Saida/Sidon, which is mentioned in the movie.  He still has family living in Beirut and elsewhere in the country, so we knew of what took place during the bombings, kept track of the family and what was happening during this time on TV and the net.  BUT, to see what the film maker was able to get on film was amazing, though I'm sure hard for my husband to watch.

3657917,4,B001JH7F42,"Sous Les Bombes (Under The Bombs) 2007, Arabic, is not about terrorism. Neither is it about religion, or extremism.

It is a story about a mother and a son separated by unfortunate bombings of a conflicted region in Lebanon.

It starts with Zeina rushing to Lebanon where she finds fear, apprehension, military, international media, destruction, distraught families. And then she finds Tony: a brave Christian cab driver. Both start on a dangerous journey to the disputed region, with their own motives (alert: Tony's motives do not see light until the very end).

What followed was beyond my predictions, and was subtle yet gripping. I forgot that I was watching a movie and not a well crafted documentary (I still believe some of the characters were actual victims of the war... I cannot fathom stage actors bringing the creepy calm that you see on their faces in some of the frames).

Tony, who starts with a greed to squeeze most of Zeina's money owing to her desperation, unravels his true self just when she needs it the most (I will keep the details for you to enjoy).

The frames are stitched together with eerie monologues, empathetic dialogues, poor yet helping hands, a failing state, and a dry yet gorgeous scenery of rural Lebanon.

In the end, sacrificing in their own ways, they do get within hand's reach of Karim, Zeina's lost son.

But are they able to get to him? And what happens to their life thereafter? Does Zeina leave her uninterested business-man husband for a stranger she just met, because he provided more for her in 3 days than her partner of 20 years?

Watch it now to know more. I guarantee a wash out of all your strong prejudices against the Arabic people. You will find that common people nowhere want to bear wars, and the losses that fall out. You will realize that underneath that stereotyped Middle-Eastern face of Tony lies a young and soft heart who enjoys music, food, dreams and a struggle to get to them.

I rate it 4.7/5.0.

3657919,5,B001JH7F42,"Like Haskell Wexler filming ""Medium Cool"" during events on the streets of Chicago in 1968, French-Lebanese director Philippe Aractingi takes his cameras into war-torn South Lebanon, following two fictional characters in a very real world of bombed-out devastation. The result is a shocking and compelling docudrama, where nonprofessional supporting actors play themselves in the tenuous aftermath of 33 straight days of bombing and shelling. Never amateurish or clumsy, the film assumes the structure of a road movie, in which a taxi driver agrees to drive a distraught mother from Beirut to the village where her son has been living with her sister.

Leveled buildings line the roads, and shattered bridges prevent their progress. Suspense builds as a bond between the two characters grows, made especially poignant by the fact that one is Christian and the other Muslim. This film held me all the way to its galvanizing end. The performances of Nada Abou Farhat, as the woman, and Georges Khabbaz as the taxi driver are wonderful.
