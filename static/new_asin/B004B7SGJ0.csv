4313947,5,B004B7SGJ0,"When one of my Sunday school fifth graders brought this in to class I was a little skeptical that it would be worth watching.  I let them watch it and was tremendously surprised at how creative and entertaining it turned out to be.  I laughed so hard that I knew I had to buy a copy so my husband and teenager could watch it too.  It was just as funny the second time.  Seriously, this movie is hilarious and the dialog is so clever!  I hope they do more of these soon!",1334016000,,469,4.054347826086956
4313948,5,B004B7SGJ0,"I ordered the wrong item, this mistake was 100% my fault.  After contacting the company through e-mail I received an e-mail and telephone response.  Kind, courteous and helpful is an understatement.
Would absolutely recommend doing business with them",1313971200,,250,5.552631578947368
4313949,5,B004B7SGJ0,"My five-year-old son and I visited BrickFair yesterday, and he saw this video being screened in a corner. I didn't pay much attention to it as I was looking elsewhere. When I grabbed him to get up and leave, I noticed that it was a Bible story.

WHAT?!?

I viewed it for a second or two, and then didn't hesitate to buy both their DVDs. He has been watching them non-stop since we got home yesterday afternoon. He's at least seen them enough (I think he's on his eighth viewing of Jericho right now) that it's playing in the background as he plays with his own LEGO bricks. I took this into church this morning and showed our Director of Christian Education after services. She loved it -- I may have to order another copy and donate it to the church!

Thank you so much for kindling a spirit of wonder in Bible stories in such an imaginative way. (And for the record, his favorite part is when they ""arm the troops"".)",1312675200,,918,4.325581395348837
4313950,5,B004B7SGJ0,My kids (8yr and 6yr) both loved this video.  It is fun and has great humor too. Christian version of Lego DVD.  I recommend this DVD for all the kids who love Lego and for the family who are looking for good and clean story for kids.  They did great job making this DVD!  We will be looking for another Lego bible stories.,1308528000,,323,4.079365079365079
4313951,5,B004B7SGJ0,"This is a great ministry!!  Very impressive product and wonderful customer service experience.  They ship fast too!  We purchased this for our son's lego themed birthday party and we are so excited for the party day to arrive to share it with friends. We even purchased the other title they offer because we were so impressed.  This is a must have for any lego fan, also a great tool to share about God's love.  We will be recommending these movies to everyone we know as well as sharing them with our children's church kids and Awana club.  THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  Can't wait to see more titles. Keep up the good work you are doing!!!",1296691200,11,645,4.461538461538462
4313952,5,B004B7SGJ0,"WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW! What an amazing gem I found one day while trying to find videos on Jericho for my 2nd grade students. I happened upon the trailer for this video on Godtube and wondered if it was a real movie. As I searched, I saw that it was and couldn't wait to purchase it for my students. I wish you could have seen their faces and how they ran to hug me when I revealed it today! PRICELESS! It was like Christmas morning! We only had time to see a little today and they are SMITTEN! I am SMITTEN! THIS IS AMAZING, SO COOL! Two students were absent today so we are just too excited to watch it from the beginning tomorrow for them! This has instantly become a permanent fixture in my classroom curriculum and the children can't wait to tell their parents about it too! My school is part of a large church, so I will undoubtedly be sharing it with the youth and children's ministers as well! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!",1296086400,22,920,4.232954545454546
4313953,5,B004B7SGJ0,"If you like Lego's. If you like animation. If you like Bible stories.  You need to see this!  We still watch in amazement on the work that went into this super film.  We are selling it in our camp store and kids love it, parents love it and college students love it.  A fun film for everyone.  Our favorite activity is to watch scenes frame by frame and marvel at all of those pictures taken.  Buy your copy today.",1294704000,8,414,4.177215189873418

4313956,5,B004B7SGJ0,Great movie for Christian youth. Clean humor and a really fun for adults to watch too! I pray they make some more! Bible series please Legos!! My boys  and nieces love this movie! Fun for ages 3- 10. I have lots of kids I watch and they love this movie!,1438732800,,253,4.06

4313961,5,B004B7SGJ0,"What a great video.  My children love the Lego Movie but I wanted a video with Christian values, this is excellent alternative.  It captures the attention of my children and we enjoy the humor and story line.  Watching the ""extras"" was very neat.  It showed how they made the movie, talked about God, made me want to go buy the other two videos this family put out.  Purchase and support them, worth every penny.  I hope for more!!!",1426118400,,432,4.4743589743589745
4313962,5,B004B7SGJ0,The whole family enjoyed it! It had some humor in it too.,1424131200,,57,3.8333333333333335

4313964,2,B004B7SGJ0,"I find it very concerning that none of the reviews I found on this movie mentioned the erroneous parts that are clearly not biblical.  I was very excited to find a movie with Lego figures that would continue to show my son what the Bible says and also that movies don't have to include filth to be good.

Parts which are not biblical:
* Movie: The spies who were sent to Jericho were named.
Bible: The spies are not named.

* Movie: The spy, whom the movie calls Steve, says he has been a big fan of Joshua's ever since Joshua ""parted the Red Sea, beat the Golden Goat, and ordered manna from Heaven"".
Bible:  Moses parted the Red Sea, Moses destroyed the golden `calf' which Aaron instructed the Israelites to make, and no one `ordered' manna, but rather God heard the complaints and told Moses that they were to eat quail in the evening and manna in the morning.

* Movie: Suggests one of the spies likes Rahab and after the defeat of Jericho it is suggested that the spy and Rahab get married when Joshua tells the spy ""she is a good woman"" and for him to ""take good care of her"".
Bible: The Bible simply states Rahab and her father's family lived in Israel after the defeat of Jericho.

The fact that there were computers, water dispensers, cameras, and a news media were all things that I felt fell into the creative license of movie making.  These are no different then the whole movie being made with Legos.",1420156800,6,1414,4.394636015325671
4313965,5,B004B7SGJ0,It was a gift,1417996800,,13,2.5
4313966,4,B004B7SGJ0,"Stumbled upon this looking for Bible stories to share with the kids on video. What a fun way to tell the story of Jericho. My kids, 6 year old twins, both really enjoy it and it holds their attention well. We have only had it a couple weeks and they ask for it every couple of days.",1416614400,,282,3.9649122807017543
4313967,5,B004B7SGJ0,This was a fun movie. I bought it for my church kids and they all laughed and were able to answer all my questions (which I focused on the Bible facts of course).,1413504000,,162,3.9393939393939394
4313968,5,B004B7SGJ0,It is amazing to see what some young people did in stop-motion animation.  It is well written with good humor.,1399766400,3,110,4.5
4313969,5,B004B7SGJ0,It was funny because of the news channel and the lego guy that had the camera and they had walkie talkies it was hilarious.,1390435200,,123,4.166666666666667
4313970,4,B004B7SGJ0,"I purchased this for my 5yo nephew for Christmas since he is just getting into Legos. He missed the cut off for kindergarten, but is already reading and doing other things above his age. He has always had a great attention span. He seemed a bit confused by the way the movie started. There wasn't any background information to set the scene. He didn't understand what was going on with Rahab and why. I had to stop the CD several times to explain what was happening. He definitely liked the part where the Israelites marched around Jericho 7 times. At the end he said he thought the movie was ""long"" which surprised me since he does have a great attention span. I guess it was because he didn't fully understand the story. I think after he watches the DVD several times with mom and dad to help explain it, he will understand the story and like it much better. The only part that I thought was confusing was adding the reporters into the biblical scene to report on what was happening. It was an unnecessary and confusing anachronism that was in no way seamlessly blended into the story. I'm sure it was used as a way to try to explain things a bit more, but a biblical narrator may have worked better. I am still very glad that I purchased this DVD and would definitely purchase another one from this company in the future to add to my nephew's collection.",1388448000,,1357,4.432
4313971,5,B004B7SGJ0,Our whole family enjoyed this movie. It is very well done and inspired my boys to try making their own movies with Legos. It's nice to see Bible stories come to life with Lego bricks too because its something most kids do with their free time. Reminded me of warching Veggie Tales where historical truth is mixed with humor and creative license. I will definitely buy other movies from this company.,1377993600,,399,4.633802816901408
4313972,5,B004B7SGJ0,I thought this was pretty well done - brings the story alive and is great if they love legos. yea.,1376179200,,98,3.95
4313973,5,B004B7SGJ0,My 8 year old son loves this movie!  He goes to a private Christian school and we took it for all of the children in his homeroom to see. Even his teacher loved it!!,1369353600,,165,3.8529411764705883
4313974,5,B004B7SGJ0,"This is a great version of the Bible story about how the walls of Jericho came down by supernatural provision. We loved it, and it is a great thing to share with the neighbor children and others.  It is faith strengthening, and most of all we know this story is true- which makes it extra special!  Thanks to the man who made this!",1368576000,,331,4.238095238095238
4313975,5,B004B7SGJ0,"If you have a lego lover in your house and love telling the stories of the Bible this is for you.
Yes it was a small production but remember God does BIG thing with small people.
There was humor, creativity and most of all it was biblically correct.",1365638400,9,249,4.208333333333333
4313976,5,B004B7SGJ0,My son loved this.  And I love the message.  Thanks to whomever thought this idea up.  It made a great Easter basket gift.,1357948800,,122,4.217391304347826
4313977,4,B004B7SGJ0,Purchased this for my 9 year old.  He loved the story and animation and he and his little brother have watched it many times since.  They like to replay different scenes with their lego figures.  I hope they come out with more bible stories like this one.,1357862400,,255,4.382978723404255
4313978,5,B004B7SGJ0,"This was very cleverly done.  After watching it, the boys built their own Jericho Lego set.  And they have also gotten interested in stop motion cinema, and are currently working on a project of their own.  It is so great to see how even Legos can used to praise The Lord :D",1356652800,,274,4.230769230769231
4313979,5,B004B7SGJ0,This is such an amazing and creative DVD.  Hats off to the family who came up with this. We hope they'll do more.  My young son loves this rendition of the Biblical story of Jericho but so do Mom and Dad!!!!,1351555200,,207,4.024390243902439
4313980,4,B004B7SGJ0,"My kids love anything Lego right now so when I saw this, I had to get it. It is very entertaining. The kids who made it did asn excellent job. There are special features of how they made the movie that is very inspirational to children. My kids are working on their own stories with Legos.",1349568000,,289,4.178571428571429
4313981,4,B004B7SGJ0,"I bought this for my grandson and he enjoyed it, but not sure I could get his attention for another showing. However when I loaned it to a neighbor's 8 year old lego enthusiast, he was ecstatic!",1338422400,,194,4.27027027027027
4313982,5,B004B7SGJ0,My grandsons loved this depiction of the Bible story of the walls of Jericho falling down.  The story is true to the Bible with a few little funny things that make it a cartoon.  They have watched it several times now and it seems to really hit home what really happened.  Highly recommend!,1338249600,,290,4.433962264150943
4313983,1,B004B7SGJ0,"Just because this was created by some Christians, doesn't mean it's good.  It should be noted that this is, despite the attempt to market/portray it as such, NOT a LEGO product. Perhaps it doesn't violate the letter of copyright law (i'm not a lawyer)...it certainly violates the spirit of taking a valuable property like Lego, that has built up a great reputation for quality and production, and leverage that into your own monetary scheme. While they do state in the fine print on the back of the box that this is in no way connected to actual Legos, it's slightly disingenuous given that they are clearly trying to position it as a ""Christian"" Lego film. The little eyes that see it won't realize the difference. I believe it would be more along the lines of fair use, had they just created this as a spoof/parody, and put it online for free (it is only 28 minutes long), but charging people for it, seems...dishonest to me.",1336348800,11,927,4.618181818181818

8421601,5,B004B7SGJ0,"This is another great LEGO movie.  It is fun for all ages.  It is good for kids and families because it portrays a great biblical story of a battle, without showing blood and gore.  Love it!",1505520000,3,190,4.222222222222222
8421602,5,B004B7SGJ0,"Very well done! The children, especially the younger ones, want to watch it over and over and over. Great humor mixed in without taking too much ""Literary License"". A well done adaptation of a powerful Bible story. There are not many options when it comes to Christian videos with Lego figures.",1496275200,,294,4.784313725490196
8421603,5,B004B7SGJ0,"My 3, 5, and 7 year old LOVE this movie!  I wish there were more!  It's pretty biblically correct as well as entertaining.",1491177600,,122,4.260869565217392
8421604,1,B004B7SGJ0,"Son wasn't interested in the movie at all. After Christmas he tried to watch it once and lost interest. I was very excited about getting it for him, but he didn't enjoy it. Passed onto Goodwill.",1489190400,,194,4.416666666666667
