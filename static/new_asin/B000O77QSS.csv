8183514,5,B000O77QSS,"This dvd has a very clear picture, shows all the highlights of Bellagio, from the entrance to rooms and shops, also includes views of other landmarks on Las Vegas strip, but without mayor details, there's a lady narrating the visit and short interaction with hotel personnel, I wish there were many more episodes on Vegas hotels in this series.",1451347200,,344,4.8474576271186445

8183517,1,B000O77QSS,This dvd was definitely not quality.  I think it was an amateur recording.  Very disppointing.  We order a set of three and it was a complete waste of money.,1243296000,,157,4.344827586206897
