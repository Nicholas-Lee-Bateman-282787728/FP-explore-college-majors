625806,5,6303272207,"There are not enough stars to give this movie what it deserves. If you think you know Lucy and Desi, think again. You don't know them till you watch this personal, private side of their lives. This movie has great  behind-the-scenes footage, real Arnaz family home movies, and interviews  with Lucy and Desi, their friends, and their relatives. Their kids do a  beautiful job of telling us about their wonderful parents. If you're  emotional like me, then you better keep a box of tissues handy. At the end,  when they show Lucy and Desi playing with their grandkids in the pool, and  Lucy reaches out and tousles Desi's hair,you can feel the chemistry between  them. They loved eachother till their dying days. This is the most  touching, personal, candid account of Lucy and Desi's onscreen and  offscreen life on film. It can't get any better than this. A true must-see  for any Lucy-Desi fan. Lucy, Desi, I miss you!",957657600,,920,4.729559748427673

Thank you ""little Lucy and Desi"" for sharing such intimate moments of your parents who were and still are...60 years later....STARS in our hearts.  They made us laugh, love, and be happy and joyful.  What a gift they BOTH left us.  Desi did not get his due, but the man was a genius way before his time.  This is a lovely tribute to them both.

625981,4,6303272207,"I enjoyed this very much and just wish the sound was better. I had to rewind a couple of times to make sure I heard something correctly.

I loved the home movies the most, having read other biographies and seeing the one at the end, in the pool, made me smile and tear up. I think although they were happier apart most of the time, their love never died.

Desi wrote his own biography and he does go into his faults, jokes that with alcoholics anonymous, weight watcher groups, cigarette stoppers, and one day he thought they'd be sex anonymous, he was in good company. (was kind of correct with the latter one)He never could do anything in moderation and although he made no bones about it, wished he could have been more the man Lucy wanted later in life. He did always love her in his own way. His last conversation was with her on the phone.

They did bring a lot of laughs and joy to many and this DVD shows another side of a multifaceted couple.",1420934400,2,951,4.301675977653631

Lucie Arnaz did a great job putting the interviews together & offering up her family's home movies. She interviews Lucy's oldest friends from Jamestown, and friends the couple made when they were in Hollywood. You get to see amazing moments from their early years all the way up to the 1980s & got to see all the love they still shared 20 years after their divorce. It's a beautiful treasure of a DVD.

This was a great behind-the-scenes look at her life, and Desi's life and times as well. A classic pair totally in love that captured our hearts. The movie seems to be recorded on low volume, but it's nothing that can't be fixed by turning up the sound bar. I love Lucy!",1396396800,,425,4.3924050632911396

626024,5,6303272207,"I have been a Lucy and Desi fan since I first discovered it.  This movie brought me to tears because I knew they always loved each other no matter what!  I don't care what anyone says.  I was in Hollywood in 1985 & 1986.  I rode by their house and her car was in the driveway.  I was going to knock on the door but since an officer was driving toward me I kept going.  The second year I lost my nerve.  I still feel guilt to this day.  I let the opportunity of a lifetime go by! I can just imagine her opening the door and me passing out! I know her doorbell rang many times a day and she was always a lady and opened the door.  I think she was pretty lonely.
 All her tapes are fantastic.  Go look buy!  On Amazon of course.  Where else would you go for a good deal??
Desi was incessantly multi talented and hard working and Lucy was extremely funny and so talented.  They were two people in love who were raised differently but loved each other for always.  Desi was so handsome and I still have a crush when I see him on my DVDs or TV.
I also want to commend Lucie and Desi Jr. for talking candidly and keeping it together while talking about their famous parents.  I have every book and DVD and I watch them every morning from the East coast from 5-9 every morning.
 God Bless Lucie and Desi Jr.",1393804800,4,1299,4.031372549019608
626025,5,6303272207,"A beautiful love story.  He was a very passionate person she was reserved. He worked hard and played hard, she worked hard and played bridge. He was Cuban and raised in wealth, she was American and raised working class. They both found their way into showbiz and they were surviving  but then they found each other and history was made-only nobody really knows that part. Nobody gave Desi credit for a lot of things he started in the movie industry except Lucy ;and Desi in turn gave all the credit of their success to Lucy. They loved each other and they admired each other to the end.",1393200000,3,586,4.4672897196261685

It is so extravagant and beautiful, and this video is a good showcase for you to see its splendors. It's not like being there in real life of course, but what video could possibly do that? It was fun to see those sights again after seeing them the first time 5 years ago.

626075,5,6303272207,"Love the home movies and the one thing that comes through is that Desi and Lucie Jr, were traumatized by their parents' break-up and were always trying to get them to reconcile. Once again, the home movies make this worth it, and it reminds us non-hollywood, everyday people that although couples may love each other, it doesn't mean they can make a relationship work. From this it is clear that Lucy and Desi loved each other until the end. Sort of sad,",1377734400,6,454,4.548780487804878

I bought the VHS version (which I absolutely wore out from more viewings than I can count) immediately after watching it when it originally aired on TV some years ago. A treasured glimpse into the personal lives of two very special people who, for a time at least, held the world in the palms of their hands due to the immense popularity of their TV show, I Love Lucy (Which was just one of 15 shows they came to produce in the 1950's.)

Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie is a wonderful treat. As I say, in the title of this review, it's A MUST HAVE for fans everywhere. Enjoy!",1352419200,2,679,4.183206106870229

(Differed greatly from the made-for-t.v.movie). It contains Lucy and Desi Arnaz's home movies of their first home together and their genuine affection and respect for each other even after the divorce. Also has interviews with people who grew up with them. EVERY ""I Love Lucy"" fan should see this. It humanizes these people. No longer just characters on t.v.

This has great home footage of the two, in color, great behind the scenes footage and gives a great look into their marriage although I felt there were still unanswered questions... Its great to watch their children talk about their famous parents. I must confess I got emotional, it was moving. There is also bonus footage of the two on various gameshows of the day and other interviews with family and friends. This is for those of you who enjoyed watching these two on I Love Lucy! BUY IT! The last home movie played was heartwarming... the two of them playing with their first grandchild!",1335830400,3,706,4.8429752066115705
626164,5,6303272207,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful, well-done film about Lucy and Desi.  It just breaks your heart to see these two people, who were meant for each other, being driven apart by the success of a show they did just so they could be together.  As Lucie Arnaz points out, we got the show but they lost each other.

Toward the end of this wonderful video, a family member asks, ""What were you afraid of, Lucille?""  It tears her apart to blurt out that question, and when I heard it, I knew it was the truth - what frightened her so much?

The story of this marriage I consider one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century, right up there with Scott and Zelda and Maria and Onassis.  Don't miss this one!",1324771200,4,703,4.2481203007518795

626168,5,6303272207,"LUCY AND DESI: A HOME MOVIE is an intimate documentary on American tv's (still) most famous couple, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that was produced by their daughter Lucie Arnaz and her husband Laurence Luckinbill.  This is a two-hour documentary (originally aired on NBC-TV in the mid 1990's) on their lives, careers, and bittersweet love story.  Many of the duo's relatives, friends and associates are interviewed (some of them famous, such as Ann Miller, Van Johnson, Bob Hope, Gale Gordon, and Jackie Cooper) but the undeniable highlight is clips from Lucy and Desi's personal home movie collections over the decades, including ones as early as the early 1940's and in color no less!! This dvd is essential for any I LOVE LUCY fan and won a well-deserved Emmy.  Lucie Arnaz discusses her parents thoroughout the film (her younger brother, Desi Arnaz Jr., somewhat less so) and at times the film seems harder on her mother than her father (Lucie recalls several rather unflattering memories of Lucy but what is negative about Desi is not coming from her lips).  As she notes, nobody (well, hardly anybody) has a ""Father Knows Best"" sugar-coated existance.  I enjoyed the documentary and there are many touching moments (again most of this the candid film footage, including the closing moments of Lucy and Desi reunited in the swimming pool with Lucie's firstborn baby in the 1980's).  One thing I would have liked would have been for the dvd's ""bonus features"" to have included additional footage from the home movies, instead we get interview comments that didn't make it into the final edit of the show still every Lucy fan/collector should own a copy of this dvd to go along with their series' season sets and movies.",1316908800,2,1722,4.9206896551724135

They brought smiles and laughter to millions of people all over the world. If only they could have been able to make it work out between them. I will always believe that these two people truly loved one another, but human frailty tore them apart. I Love Lucy will go on to delight us for generations to come. There will ""never"" be another beautiful, funny and wholesome series like it!",1313971200,3,588,4.258928571428571
626219,4,6303272207,"The LUCY AND DESI: A HOME MOVIE is a wonderful documentary, directed by daughter Lucie Arnaz, and shows color home movies of the famous television couple as newlyweds, during the ""I Love Lucy"" run, and even as seniors citizens long after their divorce. It also shows other family members and has interviews with family and friends, and includes clips from both their respective movie careers.

One serious flaw in this production is the sound quality on some of the interviews. I'm not talking about sound bites taken from old interviews or television appearances by Ball or Arnaz, which cannot be helped, the sound issues present are on some of the then current interviews with friends and family members. Some voices are muffled to the point that it's very hard to understand what the person is saying. It's like someone forgot to take the cap off the microphone or something.

I'm almost deducted two-stars because of this. It's not on all the interviewees, just on some, so it's not terrible throughout, but someone really dropped the ball on this one. It's a shame because it really seems like a labor of love for Lucie Arnaz to uncover and share some of the most private home movies with the fans, not to mention the interviews that both Ball and Arnaz did on shows like on Johnny Carson and other talk shows so you get their side of the story as well.

Luckily there are captions, so you can turn them on to understand what is being said. Still, it's a glaring error and I'm surprised that it wasn't caught in time before being shipped out on DVD.

It's funny because the extras on the DVD do not suffer from this problem, so it must have been an issue when they tapped the interviews themselves.

Anyway, the special features on the DVD are plentiful:

******  DVD EXTRAS  ******

INTERVIEW WITH LUCIE & DESI, JR. ARNAZ - 31:09-minutes - Unedited interview with Desi, Jr. & Lucie about growing up in Hollywood, etc. Desi, Jr. tends to ramble but it does give one insight into what it was like growing up with the famous TV couple.

OUT TAKES - 20:33 - These are out-takes and bloopers from the making of this documentary and not of ""I Love Lucy."" There are also other stories presented here as well that didn't make the final cut.

LUCY & DESI COMMERCIALS - 12:51-minutes
Various commercials for Westinghouse that feature Ball and Arnaz as ""Lucy"" and ""Ricky,"" along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley as ""Ethel"" and ""Fred"" and Keith Thibodeaux as ""Little Ricky."" These must have been done for the Christmas season and I enjoyed watching these. The picture and sound is pristine.

HERE'S LUCY PROMO - 02:03-minutes
Promo for the DVD sets.

WHAT'S MY LINE 1955 - 09:16-minutes
Old TV show with Lucy & Desi as the ""mystery guests"" were the panel try and guess who it is.

I'VE GOT A SECRET 1956 - 23:49-minutes
Celebrity panel including Lucy and they try and guess what the secret is. Desi makes an appearance, too. This is funny because the contestants get some prize money and a carton of cigarettes, LOL. Oh how times have changed!

Anyway, aside from the sound issue, the DVD is well worth it for Lucy fans. I just wished they fixed the sound!",1301875200,7,3155,4.629032258064516

626221,5,6303272207,"This DVD is a nostalgic peek inside the lives of these incredibly talented people, and is a must have for the fan.  It illustrates how poignant their lives were, and the price they paid for making American television history. This could make one cry, and really is a home movie with narration, interviews, and bonuses.

I give the content of this DVD 5 stars, however, I give the sound 3 stars.  The sound is contrasty on some of the interviews only, but I'm not sure that it is the fault of the production or the lack of vocal projection of the interviewee.  Words came through enough to get the gist of what was being communicated, but some words of the sentences were muffled, and I found myself backtracking in spots, turning the volume up to hear what was said.  This could be related to the Samsung blu-ray player I used, so don't let this stop you from getting this wonderful DVD.  I've noticed some of my blu-ray discs do the same thing.  I didn't have this problem with the sound on the I Love Lucy complete series, of which I just finished a five week marathon before watching this DVD.

The images are fantastic, and the 5 bonus Westinghouse promotions they hosted are a phenomenal trip into that era.  The two bonus game show appearances they made are not just cuts, but the full episodes of What's My Line, and I've Got A Secret.  Why these weren't included on the complete series DVDs, I'll never know.  Just get this DVD if you Love Lucy.",1292025600,3,1453,4.465909090909091

for the sound, which I thought could have been better.  I would have loved to have seen a little more of Vivian Vance, since I thought she and Lucy were very close during and after the show.  My main disappointment was in the bloopers!  There is an Outakes section, but it is of Lucie and Desi, Jr making the documentary, not of the I Love Lucy Show, which is what I thought the bloopers would be from, since that is what the description leads you to believe.",1288656000,7,572,4.317757009345795

A great DVD to own.",1274832000,,341,3.56
626225,4,6303272207,"The most interesting thing on this DVD, to me, is in the bonus features.  There is a game show called 'I've got a secret' that Lucy is on.  The show has a guest who has a secret and must answers questions from the celebrity panel.  The guest whispers in the ear of the host the secret, to which they display on the screen(or something along the lines of): 'witnessed the assassination of President Lincoln.'  This show was in the mid 1950's and this man is in his late 90's.  He was 5 years old when he witnessed the assassination.  After the panel had guessed who he is, the old man said that as a kid he was concerned about the guy who fell from the balcony.  Obviously he did not know about the President being shot as John Wilkes Booth jumped from the balcony to escape!

Oh yeah, the rest of the dvd, that has Lucy and Desi on it: Very good, very interesting.  A lot of pictures and home videos and more than I thought it would be when I bought it.  A lot of interviews from family members, including thier 2 kids who made this documentary, and celebrities(Lucy's brother, neice & cousins are on here).  There are a ton of bonus features:  Lucy & Desi commercials for kitchen appliances that are not on the I Love Lucy or Lucy-Desi comedy hour DVDs), appearances on game shows, photo gallery, etc.  The only real dissapointment for me was the often muddled sound of, well, EVERYTHING since its all so old.  But I did not expect the documentary, made in the mid 1990's, to sound that way.  Unfortunately it does.  It sounds like someone ran a VHS copy off and put it on the DVD with no effort to improve the sound.  However, this DVD is worth buying.  I was just expecting better sound since it is on a DVD.",1249344000,8,1711,4.310344827586207
626226,5,6303272207,"LUCY AND DESI: A HOME MOVIE first aired on CBS-TV on Valentine's Day, 1993. As stated at the outset of this Emmy-winning documentary, it was an answer from family and friends of the famous couple to a 1991 TV movie expos&eacute; entitled:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LUCY-DESI-BEFORE-THE-LAUGHTER/dp/6302676460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LUCY & DESI: BEFORE THE LAUGHTER</a>.  (VHS only)

Factually correct, this tribute glosses over only a couple of points:
Desi's womanizing is dismissed as part of Cuban culture, besides, he couldn't help himself-- those girls threw themselves at him (yah sure).
Lucy's relationship with Vivian Vance is described as loving and sisterly. Maybe so in later years, but during the run of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-LOVE-LUCY/dp/B000TGJ8B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I LOVE LUCY</a>&nbsp;Vance highly resented that she was forced to look dowdy and decades older than the show's star, when in fact there was only a two year difference in their ages.

The program is hosted by daughter Lucie and features commentary from Desi Jr., Gale Gordon (still vital in his late-80s), Van Johnson, Ann Miller, scripters Bob Weiskopf, Bob Schiller, Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, Jackie Cooper and author/editor James Bacon. Contributing family members include Lucy's brother Fred and her cousin Cleo Morgan.

Highlighted are many clips of beautifully-preserved full color home movies, plus scenes from pictures that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz appeared in, both individually and as a team. They're younger in their privately-shot films than they are during the TV show years, and so obviously in love. These marvelous glimpses (courtesy of the Arnaz kids), plus the personal recollections make a for fine Valentine card to America's all-time favorite TV couple.

Their lives are presented to us with absolute love and affection by Lucie Arnaz's direction, her commentary, as well as commentary by Desi Arnaz, Jr, Fred Ball, family and friends both personal and professional.  This is the ultimate Lucy and Desi story from those in the know.  I've worn out my VHS copy when I need a refresher.  Glad it is on DVD in pristine quality.  The ""blooper"" bonus is worth the price alone.  I hadn't laughed so hard in a long time.  Other bonuses included are several end-of-show commercials for Westinghouse products by the cast of the later Lucy-Desi Hour specials (those that would fit in after final announcements, etc in the bonus features of ""I Love Lucy, Seasons 7-8-9"").  What I call an ""extra taste"" is the ""Here's Lucy"" promo, which I thought before I pressed play was a commercial used to promote the show on CBS.  Lo and behold, it was a long promo indicating that MPI will put out all six seasons of ""Here's Lucy"" in the future, plus the Lucille Ball Specials from 1974-80 that followed this series, and haven't been seen since original broadcast on CBS.  I was flabbergasted, especially when I didn't see the second special with Dean Martin called ""Lucy Goes To Vegas"".  The promo also shows beautiful picture and sound for all snipets of the episodes represented.  Cannot wait until these come out.  Will ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Life With Lucy"" soon follow?

There have been many, many documentaries created that seem as though you're reading a gossip column or  tabloid magazine in the grocery store. The other documentaries made about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz have been, compared to this DVD, frankly--disappointing.

626294,5,6303272207,"Granted, I am partial to writing a good review for this documentary as I do indeed love Lucy, but I gave it 5 stars for another reason altogether:  As a student of film and fan of documentaries regardless of subject, I have to report that ""Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie"" succeeds as fine filmmaking due to its frank treatment of the subject matter -  romance and dissolution of a marriage in Hollywood - as well as its emotional (but not overly sentimental) portraits of both Lucy and Desi.  In addition, the film's engrossing, captivating use of Ball-Arnaz home movies and audio recordings is unprecedented.

This review is written based off of the original video (from 1992) of the film and not related to the DVD itself in regards to quality or production, so please take that into note when ordering... but do order it if you, like me, love Lucy - as it is probably the best and most honest portrait of she and Desi you'll ever see - or are a fan of biographies, Hollywood history, or great documentaries.",1228953600,49,1007,4.54696132596685

""Lucy and Desi"" is a fine, objective look at a troubled, but supremely talented and well-loved pair.  While most other tapes I watched had the same pictures and clips, this one was full of things I had never seen or heard before.  There are many, many interviews, and to anyone who has seriously studied Ball and Arnaz's lives, many names will be familiar.  The tidbits they provide are alternately funny and heartbreaking.  That brings me to the one reservation I have regarding this production.  For anyone who thinks Lucy and Desi were just like their alter egos, the Ricardos, and would like to hang on to that myth, don't watch this film.  Though it is a loving look, it doesn't shirk from revealing the dark areas of their personalities as well.  Personally, I think this objective approach is important and should be commended, but when I first began to study Lucy, I was greatly shocked by the pain and unhappiness in her life, and it temporarily altered my unbridled enjoyment of ""I Love Lucy"".  Just a warning.  Still, any Lucy lover who is prepared for a few hard truths should thoroughly enjoy this fascinating, well-made treat.",1025395200,8,1371,4.771186440677966

There are many beautifully preserved home movies from the forties and fifties of which Lucy and Desi took of each other, taking turns and with friends. They are fascinating records of both lively parties and pensive moments. Their various show-business friends are in many - in one, everyone's doing the ""La Conga"" in which Desi introduced to the States in 1938. Because this legendary couple is so universally beloved, it's a ""good kind of sad"" to see Lucy and Desi when they were young, beautiful and so obviously in love. I have the utmost admiration for them both; they aspired to make it to the top and they made it - the honest, old - fashioned way thru hard work, talent and perseverance! Lucy was astonishingly brave for a woman in her day and in all actually a very strong individual: Lucy was once asked what she felt about women's lib in the 70's. Her reply? ""Oh, I'm afraid that doesn't interest me in the least. I've been so liberated it hurts!"" There are amusing tidbits about Lucy and Desi as she's lovingly remembered by Madelyn Pugh-Davis and Bob Carroll, Jr. (writers for I Love Lucy) - Lucie and Desi Arnaz, Jr. - Marcella Rabwin (a family friend) - Fred Ball (Lucy's brother) - Gale Gordon - Carole Cook - plus a delightful insight by her cousin, Cleo.",998956800,,1398,4.573705179282869

While this video shows great home movies and interviews with family friends, it also tells the bad side of the ""Ricardos"" - a lot of things that many of us would really rather not know.  For example, there is a scene where daughter Lucie speaks of seeing her mother ""leaning over Desi with her long red finger nails poised at him, saying 'I wish you were dead'.""  There is also vast description of Desi's affairs and alcoholism.  Sadly, everyone interviewed concludes that Lucy and Desi never got over loving each other, which led to them both being exiled and bitter in their final years.

I love the movies of their wedding, and the song ""Forever Darling"".  I also love the scene at the end with Lucy and Desi in the pool with their first grandson.  That was the last home movie of them together.  You could tell that they still loved and cared for one another immensely.  I love when Lucy messes up Desi's hair!  That is so cute.

626332,5,6303272207,"This documentary which digs deep into the private lives of legendary comic husband-and-wife team Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz is certainly remarkable. The information has been thoroughly researched, home movies are shown dating back to the early forties and late fifties, and even love letters written by the two to each other are shown. Also interwoven are comprehensive looks at their professional careers. Also included are interviews with relatives, children (the documentary is hosted by daughter Lucie Arnaz), and Hollywood friends and associates.
However, there is a great deal of bittersweet drama in their stories, especially during the beginning of the lives of both. Ball's father died when she was three, she did not get on with her stepfather, and her family endured legal hardships for several years when her grandfather was sued for accidentally allowing minors to shoot a gun. Arnaz's family fled Cuba and watched their house burn down during the Cuban Revolution of 1933. Ball and Arnaz meet in Hollywood and wed, but there is always an underlying suggestion of philandering on Arnaz's part.
In the early fifties, when the ""I Love Lucy"" show began, and Ball had her two children, both Ball and Arnaz became consumed by work. Arnaz would spend time with the children, but also drink. Ball is portrayed as a constant workaholic. It is during this part of the show that there is a lot of uneasy candor on the part of Ms. Arnaz and interviewees about Ball's difficulty being a mother, and Ball comes off sounding very unsentimental and hard. Even more difficult to swallow is the candor involving the eventual breakup of the two told by Ms. Arnaz and her brother, Desi Jr.
The documentary ends on a very bittersweet note, with several interviewees recounting that both thought it terrible that things worked out as they did, but there is a little complacency for the viewer, because the last home movie shown in the film is Ball and Arnaz in a pool in the early eighties, playing with their first grandchild, Simon. However, eerily dramatic scoring, some literally frightening stories and photographs, and the difficult unravelling of the story may make some ""Lucy"" fans uneasy. Be warned.",972518400,6,2201,5.016393442622951

It focuses of the lives of  two people that made America laugh - all the while struggling in their  personal lives.  I don't think you will find a better program about this  incredible couple.  New generations to come will no doubt watch ""I  Love Lucy"" reruns and laugh!  This is the story of the people behind  those great laughs.",960249600,13,819,4.311258278145695

I was hoping to find the  movie, Lucy & Desi: Before the Laughter (1991) with Frances Fisher and Rance Howard.  Even though I understand there is some inaccuracies with some of the facts.  I just enjoy seeing actors portraying real life characters and then gauging how well they did.

7843683,5,6303272207,"This summer, I took a spur-of-the-moment trip to Jamestown, NY, Lucys hometown. It was a rather interesting trip as theres a lot of Lucy (and Desi) stuff going on there. I would go as far as to say that Lucy is keeping that town alive. Jamestown boasts the Desilu Studios museum, the Lucy and Desi Museum, Lucys birth house and the house she grew up in, the Lucy statues (scary Lucy and upgraded Lucy), several large murals on the sides of some of the downtown buildings, an annual comedy festival (Joan Rivers performed there in 2011 for Lucys 100th Birthday Celebration) and the most poignant of all  Lucys grave and family plot at the Lake View Cemetery. You enter the cemetery and follow the hearts to the Ball and Hunt (her mothers family) family plot. She was cremated and originally interred in California but her children had Lucy and her mother, Dee Dee, moved back to the family plot in Jamestown, where her brother, Fred, who passed away in 2007, is also buried.

Anyway, seeing what I saw there really drove home Lucys impact on the world. Not just in the entertainment field but on the WORLD. She is still making it possible for her beloved Jamestown to employ and entertain people, which, in turn, helps the hotels, restaurants, young comedians, and on and on. She is alive in that town, even today, and making a difference in peoples lives.

When I left Jamestown, especially after going through the two museums, I wanted to learn more about the woman I grew up with as well as about Vivian Vance (but thats another review!) and I saw this documentary that was produced by her children, who seem to have grown into pretty normal people, not quite what you might expect from celebrity children of a legend like Lucy. This was an eye-opening viewing experience. And surprisingly, at the end of it, it was Desi Arnaz who impressed me the most. He was a genius, as far as Im concerned. Until I saw this, all I really knew about Desi was his philandering and his innovations as far as the three-camera system of filming situational comedy was concerned. Desi was a lot more complex than I had imagined. I have come to understand that the philandering was partially due to cultural beliefs ingrained in him from his experiences in his own immediate family (not that this makes it at all okay in any way but, at the very least, it is an explanation). But, especially in the interview, Lucie and Desi Jr. give in the extra features of the disc, Desi Sr. emerges as a loving father, a genius producer and businessman as well as a lover of nature. He was a lot deeper than I had expected him to be. The other surprise was that Lucy was a bit harder than Desi in a lot of ways. Desi was still a philanderer and they even bring up prostitutes at one point, but he was a lot of other things, too. One thing that surprised me was when the children discussed how Desi, when home from work, was able to settle in and do things with them in ways Lucy wasn't able to as she was always in a work frame of mind. And how much he appreciated things like a sunset or nature. Desi was also very patriotic and served in WWII.

The entire documentary is composed of interviews from various family members, the kids, neighbors, other entertainers, etc. and through home movies, personal photos and historical locations.

Vivian Vance is briefly mentioned and appears here and there and the impression that you get is that they were simpatico, but the reality is that they sometimes had a rocky relationship, though they respected (even loved) each other for the rest of their lives.

While Lucy and Desi divorced when their children were still young, it is apparent that there was a lot of love between them that somehow seems to have lasted the rest of their lives (theres some beautiful footage of the two playing with their grandson in a pool in their later lives) despite their marriages to other people.

I am simultaneously reading the Vivian Vance biography and Meet the Mertzes, which I will review separately.

I think this is a must-see for any Lucy fan.
