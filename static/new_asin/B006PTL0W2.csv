8502907,5,B006PTL0W2,I wasn't aware of these Japanese SciFi classics from the 60s until I found them on Amazon. They are a lot of fun to watch. I highly recommend getting the Alpha Video version because they are the best available copies.,1452988800,,217,4.45

8502910,5,B006PTL0W2,"Starman is made of the strongest steel.  In each of the 4 ""Movies"", ( Invaders from Space) not included in this set, but included in the 2 volume set, he is always set to earth by the men of the  Emerald planet in the Moffet galaxy to stop atomic war that would eventually send radiation into the galixy.  Seems that producers of these shorts that were put together for american movies still had hiroshima and nagasaki on their minds.  I can watch all 4 of these movies every night for months on end.  They are so ridiculous,  that I really love them. Starman blowes Superman away, because he has the Globemeter. Also, many cute Japanese girls!",1394064000,,644,4.508620689655173
8502911,5,B006PTL0W2,"Starman is genius in it's  low budget,naive, Japanese craziness!!!!! It boggles  the mind.
Armed with the Globemeter and under orders from the Galaxy council, Starman saves  us all.
GENIUS cheesy fun!!!!!!!!!!",1354665600,5,209,5.67741935483871
