8760195,3,B01F5SX1F2,"Intriguing at first but goes downhill after gas poisoning, becomes routine mindless, gratuitously violent in the image of 'Hollywood'. Shame, it was going well until that. The final beach and eatery scenes were back on track but too little too late.  3 / 5",1504569600,,256,4.818181818181818
8760196,4,B01F5SX1F2,"Sea Fog is an excellent film, with a morally complex story-line that builds in suspense.  I wouldn't call it a horror film at all, but it is dark, and there is a collapse of human, ethical bearing that is troubling.  The film is surprisingly well done.  Wonderful cinematography and great acting.  There are some explicit sex scenes and enough violence to make you want to keep your kids from watching, or otherwise sensitive viewers, but it is not gratuitous.  The ending was odd and seemed forced, but it was realistic enough to make one realize that a Cinderella ending would have been ridiculous.  Highly recommended, but not quite five stars.",1488844800,,647,4.836363636363636

8760199,4,B01F5SX1F2,"It's a well made Korean movie with very realistic acting. The one thing I did not understand was how the captain got so crazy so quickly. But in the end, everyone got what he deserved.",1476489600,,184,4.285714285714286

8760201,5,B01F5SX1F2,"I've waited since 2014 for this movie and wasn't disappointed.  Park Yuchun, one of the stars shines in his first movie, and it's clear why he won 9 Best New Actor awards for this role.  The movie was intense to watch at times because of the violence and suspense, but the actors were all top notch and believable.",1471305600,2,314,4.396551724137931
