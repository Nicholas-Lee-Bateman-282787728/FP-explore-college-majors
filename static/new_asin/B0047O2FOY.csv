8418268,3,B0047O2FOY,"Laughton was great as the heavy, who was obviously mentally ill. The early view of Cary Grant was interesting. The story itself was weak, the submarine was obviously silly. The actors did the best they could.",1399507200,2,208,4.805555555555555
8418269,4,B0047O2FOY,It was fun to see Cary Grant and Gary Cooper as young men. The interior of the sub looked like something from an early 30 musical. It should be noted sub at this time were referred to as Pig Boats. The enterior of this sub spotless white and spacious. Whoever designed the set had never been in the tight greasy sub of that period in time.,1387238400,2,339,4.151515151515151
8418270,2,B0047O2FOY,Big names but still not a very good movie. Try other Charles Laughton movies and skip this one.  Gary Cooper is stiff and does a very poor acting job.  There are far better movies available with these great actors.,1377993600,,214,4.461538461538462
8418271,5,B0047O2FOY,Very interesting vintage film with Tallulah Bankhead in one of her rare appearances away from the stage and Charles Laughton's first American film chewin up the submarine scenery.  Gary Cooper in one of his first talkies is the surprise love interest as the husband believes it is Cary Grant who is his rival.  The submarine climax is excellentfor its time (1932) and Tallulah with her deep voice is tops.  Altogether a rare and intriguing love quadrangle.  Jonathan,1324339200,12,466,5.012987012987013
8418272,3,B0047O2FOY,"Universal is being misleading putting a photo of Cary Grant on the cover of this DVD; he is in the movie but THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP was one of his first films and he only has a few scenes at the beginning.  I can see them boasting his appearance for sales sake but why not also at least have the two other legends in the movie on the coveras well, the film's real stars: Gary Cooper, as iconic a movie star as Grant, and the legendary cult stage star Tallulah Bankhead in one of her relatively few motion pictures.

Tallulah stars as the neglected wife of submarine Commander Charles Laughton. Laughton, a chubby chatterbox is loved by their social acquaintances but they despise Bankhead, whom they believe is a serial adulteress thanks to her remoteness and Laughton's allusions. The real truth is Laughton is mentally unbalanced and physically abusive, believing Tallulah is sleeping with every man who says hello to her although she has never been unfaithful. Her platonic friendship with Lt. Cary Grant sends Laughton over the edge and he ruins Cary's career and beats Tallulah, who in her despair runs into the streets and spends the night out traumatized. She runs into kind stranger Gary Cooper who protects her, flirts with her, and ultimately makes love to her, Tallulah finally giving in and becoming the adulteress Laughton believes her to be. Of course, the eternally suspicious Laughton eventually finds out and plots to do away with them even if it means other deaths as well.

This melodrama suffers from mediocre writing and direction although the scenes within the submarine are effectively claustrophobic and tense. Of the cast it's a surprise that Tallulah comes off the best given her ""unusuccessful"" film career; looking like jaded Garbo with poor posture and drooping breasts, she's quite good in a crisp voice that strongly sounds like Judith Anderson, not the husky older Tallulah of legend. Laughton is very effective as her mad husband although in his first scene comes across too effeminate for the character. Cary Grant does very well in his smallish role. The big shock for me is the performance of Gary Cooper, one of my favorite stars but here he performs extremely stiffly, often reading his lines without a trace of inflection or credibility and quite often inappropriately pausing in the middle of his dialogue as if he was thinking of what was the remainder of the line! A better director would have demanded better takes for a number of scenes, not just for Cooper but some of Laughton's as well. It's still an interesting film but surely a minor one but fans of the four great stars will want to at least see it once.",1305936000,7,2655,4.792576419213974
