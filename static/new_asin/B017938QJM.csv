on some of his songs. This film was well acted and made me appreciate Rich Mullins so much more than
I already did.",1531440000,,225,4.022222222222222
8738390,4,B017938QJM,A bit slow and movie showed how flawed he was- drinking etc. would not show to kids. Did not really show his prayer life enough or his attempts to conform to the Lord. He called out hypocrits in the church. I'm glad I watched it but left me wondering about his faith.,1528675200,,267,4.153846153846154
8738391,5,B017938QJM,"Whether you're familiar with Rich Mullins or not you should watch this movie. Rich is an example of how God can use an ordinary flawed man for His glory.

The movie is well made and well acted. It helps to know a bit of the story before watching since with any movie about a persons life theres a great deal of detail left out.

It's a good reminder to all of us to not let our failures drive us from God. Rather, through our failures we recognize our need for Gods forgiveness, mercy, and grace and should therefore cause us to run toward Him.",1511913600,,544,4.221153846153846
