289756,4,6300270068,"Maybe good ole Uncle Simon can leave me one in his will.  ""Uncle Simon"" is one of the most underrated Twilight Zone episodes of all time!  I consider this 25 minute beauty a true classic.  The acting  portrayed here by the main characters is stellar.  You just can't find a  better example of true hatred expressed in this fashion.  The insults that  fly amoung Uncle Simon and his beloved niece Barbara is definitely a lost  art.  Who talks like this anymore without cursing every other word?  This  is one of the best written episodes of the series.
The other three  episodes are average with ""The 7th is Made Up of Phantoms""  probably the best of the lot.  Once again ""Uncle Simon"" is the  real catch here.  If your a true fan of the Twilight Zone, you certainly  won't throw this disc on the floor for not being hot enough!",955324800,12,827,4.436241610738255

289877,3,6300270068,"Volume 40 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series is not one of the best volumes around I feel but it is not bad at the same time. The stories on here as decent but not among the more popular episodes. Still if you are a fan of the show you will love this volume if for no other reason there are some outstanding actors who appear in this DVD.

First up is ""Cavender Is Coming"". It stars Jesse White, best known to many as the ""Lonely Maytag Repairmen"" from the Maytag commercials but a great actor in his own right, and Carol Burnett. This story was actually written by Rod Serling as a possible pilot for a TV series that didn't sell. In the story Carol Burnett is a girl who is kind of a klutz, kind of awkward and has problems keeping a job. Unbeknownst to her she has a guardian angel, Jesse White, who is on the way to help her so he can earn his wings. See he is kind of a klutz too and if he doesn't want to get in trouble with his own boss he needs to be successful in this assignment. The ""Zone"" in the past had tried its hand at comedy with meh results at best. This would be one of the episodes. It is not bad. Both Burnett and White give very good performances that saves the show but the story itself is predictable and not that interesting. Plus for the more serious fan of the show this episode will seem an awful lot like an earlier episode ""Mr. Bemis"" about a down on his luck guy who has a guardian angel show up to make his life better with results short of mayham. Pretty much the same kind of plot here.

""Passage on the Lady Anne"" is next on the disc and it is from the fourth season when the episodes were an hour in length. Probably the best episode on this volume it stars Joyce Van Patten and Lee Phillips as a married couple whose marriage is having problems. Van Patten decides a nice romantic ocean cruise might help bring them together again and books passage for the two of them on the Lady Anne. Phillips isn't keen on the thought but goes along with it. When they check on board they find they are by far the youngest couple on board. The rest of the passengers are not only elderly but made up of a collection of ""Who's Who"" of British actors including among others Wilfred Hyde-White, Gladys Cooper, Cecil Kellaway and Alan Napier just to name a few. What the elderly passengers know that the young couple don't is this is a special voyage that the young couple shouldn't be on. They also see the tension between the young couple and help to make things better for them. A good ending to the story and very well acted considering the talent of actors they have to work with here. Very good episode.

Volume 40 ends with ""The Brain Center at Whipple's"" starring Richard Deacon. He plays an company executive who is looking to modernize his company by replacing its people with computers. The story leads to an argument between Whipple and a former supervisor about replacing men with machines. It is a little predicable except for the ending which will delight anyone who hasn't seen this episode before.

The serious fan will need to add this to his collection. The casual fan may well like this too. Either way it is a good volume to include in your video collection.",1426636800,,3198,4.298507462686567
289878,4,6300270068,Great Movie!,1423699200,,12,5.5
289879,5,6300270068,nice cd,1422662400,,7,3.0
289880,5,6300270068,"""Where is Everybody"" endearingly introduces the running theme, the very spirit, of what defines the Twilight Zone. A man alone (Earl Holliman) finds himself totally isolated in an unfamiliar town, yet with very familiar surroundings found in any ""Hometown America"" setting. But, who is he, where is he and why is he there?

""Eye Of The Beholder"" says it all. Janet Tyler will have to have her bandages removed from her face to reveal if the operation was a success or not. But, there is more than meets the eye to that question and Bernard Herrmann's score brilliantly sets the mood for this very powerful study into the human psyche.

I always loved ""A Thing About Machines"" and that probably should credited to insightful scriptwriting, Richard Hayden's brilliant performance and actually some very impressionable visions depicted here of machines taking on an actual persona and turning on Hayden. In today's world, I wonder if we are actually at this point considering the supposed advances of technology in this day and age.

""A World Of His Own"" is another favorite of mine and this episode somehow seems timeless. For anyone who puts pen and ink to paper and creates characters that traverse a world they create in the mind, this should be a welcome episode. Keenan Wynn does just that, though using a Dictaphone, in the comfortable surroundings of his den. Keenan Wynn's creations however become reality in this light comedy. This episode is thoroughly enjoyable, very memorable and quite ingenious. It also has a very unique ending that I must not give away.

Well, that's it for now. I decided to start reviewing Twilight Zone episodes again somewhere back there where I left off. I cannot say enough about the Twilight Zone. It is part of us, those who grew up with it and those who have found it along the way. Always thought provoking, always captivating, always endearing to the inquisitive mind.",1421107200,,1910,4.904024767801857
289940,5,6300270068,"""The Grave"" from the Third Season has an outstanding cast headed by Lee Marvin and includes Lee Van Cleef, Strother Martin, James Best and Ellen Willrad. ""The Grave"" is a spooky Western ghost story where the wind blows never ceasing. Pinto Sykes is gunned down and killed by the townsfolk in a small tumbleweed town in the old west. Later that night, Hired gunman Conny Miller (Lee Marvin) arrives too late to rid a town of Pinto Sykes who he had been hired to track and kill. Entering the saloon on that windy and cold night he learns that the townsfolk have had their doubts about Miller's courage. Before he died, Pinto Sykes told them that Conny Miller had numerous occasions to face him man to man, but he never did. Pinto Sykes went on to say that if Conny Miller ever went near hi grave, he would reach up and grab him. Three men in the saloon (Lee Van Cleef, Strother Martin, James Best) place bets that Miller won't visit the grave at midnight. And so the stage is set as Pinto's sister laughs eerily when Miller arrives at the graveyard. ""The Grave"" was written and directed by Montgomery Pittman and is one of the more memorable episodes from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

""The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank"" from season is an interesting and amusing episode. Jeff Myrtlebank (James Best) wakes up at his own funeral and is totally confused and wants to know what happened to him. This episode also was written and directed by Montgomery Pittman from the Season 3. James Best is very good as Jeff Myrtlebank with his homespun style and humor. Jeff Myrtlebank is back, but is it really Jeff Myrtlebank?",1420934400,,1602,4.581881533101045
289941,4,6300270068,"Volume 35 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features some of the best stories from the show. Not only well written and directed they also have some top notch actors performing here. This is certainly one of those volumes any fan of the series will want to add to their video collection.

The DVD starts with ""Static"" starring Dean Jagger. The premise of this story is similar to the classic TZ episode ""Kick The Can"". An elderly man lives with other elderly people at a home. He is looking for something more interesting to do in life then sit around watching the TV like all the other residents do. Something that spurs the imagination. Then one day he goes down in the basement where there is an old radio and takes it up to his room. Once plugged in Jagger's character finds the radio plays radio shows and music from when he was a young man. One problem. Only he hears the music and radio shows. When someone else is in the room with him and the radio is on all that they hear is static. Everyone else start to think Jagger is losing his mind or something. But then the broadcasts are coming from the Zone.

Theodore Bikel stars in the second story on this DVD ""Four O'Clock"". Bikel plays a vengeful bigot who makes it his mission in life to attack anyone he deems a subversive. Bikel's character is reminiscent of one Senator Joseph McCarthy, a former senator from Wisconsin who lead an investigation back in the 1950's convinced the government was over runned with communists. Bikel's character will stop at nothing to rid those he labels as evil. Then an idea comes to him how to label those he has judged evil for all the world to see and it is to happen at 4 o'clock. And when it is 4 the world will indeed see.

The last episode on the disc is an hour program from the fourth season, ""The Parallel"". It stars Steven Forrest as an astronaut who is sent up on a space mission. During the mission a problem seems to occur but then is over and Forrest returns to Earth. But afterwards things don't seem right to Forrest. While most things are normal there are little things that seem out of place. Example, Forest is not only surprised to hear Kennedy is not President, this episode was first shown in March of 1963, but that no one has ever heard of Kennedy. It soon becomes clear to Forrest that there is such a thing as a parallel universe and he is in it. Now the question becomes can he get back to where he came from.

Altogether this is a pretty good DVD and one that is a good addition to anyone's video library whether you are a long time fan of TZ or just learning of the show.",1420761600,,2593,4.329218106995885
289942,3,6300270068,Wasn't any better than the regular DVD,1417219200,,38,4.571428571428571
289943,4,6300270068,"Volume 19 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series is one of the better ones. Four stories in all on the disc with two very good ones and two great ones. For anyone who considers themselves a fan of the show this is one DVD you will enjoy watching.

The first episode on the disc is ""A Most Unusual Camera"". Two thieves have pulled off a heist. Among the items they stole includes an old camera. Not worth a whole lot of money except wen you try to take a picture with it it takes a picture a few minutes into the future showing what is about to happen. The scheming minds of the crooks start to imagine ways they could make money with such a device but when you are in the ""Twilight Zone"" plans don't always go as planned.

""The Jungle"" is next up on the list. A man, played by John Dehner, has been over in Africa on an important business project. Along the way he angered a witchdoctor who puts a voodoo lion curse on him. Alan Richards, Dehner, doesn't believe such things and pays no mind to the warnings to be careful. Back home in New York now the curse has followed him home and like they say, it's a jungle out there. This is one of the truly scariest on the edge of your seat episodes with very little special effects save for some well placed and eerie lighting and sound effects to add to the tension.

Another classic episode is ""The 7th Is Made Up of Phantoms"". It is 1964 and three National Guardsmen are on military exercises near the area where the battle of Little Big Horn was fought. They hear the beating of drums and stampeding horses and gun fire off in the distance. A riderless horse runs by. An Indian village deserted is nearby. Everything suggests it is not 1964 but 1876 and the battle of Little Big Horn is being fought. What are three National Guardsmen to do???

Last but not least on the DVD is ""Uncle Simon"". Starring Constance Ford and Sir Cedric Hardwicke it is about a niece, Ford, who takes care of her rich uncle looking after his every demand and hating every minute of it. But she puts up with it all because she is to inherit Uncle Simon's money upon his death. But there is a stipulation that she has to take care of a creation of Uncle Simon's when he dies in order to get the money. The creation? A robot that has a lot of the same characteristics as Uncle Simon. A very good episode with great dialog going on back and forth between Uncle Simon and his niece that is creative in the words they use to insult each other without having to use gutter language like a lot of todays TV shows do. The interesting thing to this episode is the robot. Does he look familiar to you? Well if he does it is because it is Robbie The Robot best known to sci-fi movie fans from ""Forbidden Planet"". Robbie appeared in two TZ episodes during its fifth and final season on the air. The other episode Robbie was in was ""The Brain Center At Whipple's"".

This is one of those volumes from the TZ series you got to add to your video collection. Great stories with great actors, great writing and great directing!",1416096000,,3029,4.279232111692845
289944,5,6300270068,"The Twilight Zone has to be one of my favorite all time TV shows ever. I like having this TV show on DVD. This is a good old classic TV show. I remember watching this on TV in my younger days. This DVD is a good one to own. All the collections I have so far have been clear and had a great picture. I don't have any complaints about the show, the DVD or any flaws in the pictures because there isn't any that I have seen so far.

289948,3,6300270068,"The 41st volume in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series is a decent one with two good episodes and two so-so episodes. The first episode on the disc is  ""The Mighty Casey"".

Sports was not a common theme in the ""Zone"" A couple shows dealing with boxing, ""Big Tall Wish"" and ""Steel"" and one on pool ""A Game of Pool"". ""The Mighty Casey"" would be one of those few episodes and the only one dealing with baseball. A down on their luck baseball team needs some kind of miracle to change their misfortune around. That miracle came to them from a man who had been training a young man to become the greatest pitcher of all time and he was offering the services of this pitcher to the team. An offer too good to be true but the young man is astounding when he goes out on the pitchers mound and in no time becomes the ace pitcher of the team and the most dominating player in baseball. But when the truth about this baseball player is revealed to the manager of the team he learns the offer really is too good to be true.

The next episode on the disc is a true classic story from the ""Zone"", ""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up"". Reports of a UFO sends two state troopers out to find out if the area has been invades by Martians. They stop by a diner where a bus load of people have stopped for the evening due to the bridge being out. After much questioning and unable to determine if anyone in the group is indeed a Martian and with the bridge once again opened the troopers send everyone one their way. Then and only then is it revealed to the viewers if there is a Martian with one of those classic twist of an ending the ""Twilight Zone"" was known for. Only down fall for this episode is the really bad make up used in this episode but it doesn't take away too much from the story itself.

""The Changing of the Guard"" starring Donald Pleasence is about a school teacher preparing to go on holiday break only to find out he is about to be retired from the school. Teaching has been his whole life and now that it is being taken away from him he feels lost and that his life as a teacher was meaningless. That he touched none of his students over the years. That is until he gats to talk with some of his students, and I don't mean any of his students from the present, but from the past. A very good episode.

Last on the list is  ""Come Wander with Me"" with Gary Crosby in the starring role. Crosby plays a rock and roll singer who is also part conman looking to find and steal a song he can make into his next hit record. While out in the country he meets a pretty young girl and hears a song he wants to take and make his own not knowing the song is in a sense about him and his future. It's an ok episode but not I think one of the best.

So for the true TZ fan this is a DVD in the series you will want to get. I would even recommend this for the casual TZ fan. There are some good stories here to entertain anyone.",1408406400,,2912,4.071553228621291

289992,4,6300270068,"Volume number 25 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series includes 4 stories from the show. Two of them I think are rated among the classic episodes and the other two while not classics are still very good.

The disc begins with ""Execution"". Taking place in the old west a man, played by Albert Salmi, is about to be hung for murder. But as the latch is released the body suddenly disappears. At the moment the hanging occurred a scientist, played by Russell Johnson, uses a time machine to go into the past and in the process snags Salmi at the end of his rope so to speak. Now in the future Salmi is learning what the world is like now but his murderous ways still exist and Johnson soon realizes the mistake he made in bringing this man from the past to the present.

One of my all time favorite episodes from the ""Zone"" is the next story ""The Hunt"". Starring Arthur Hunnicut one of my all time favorite character actors. In the episode he goes out raccoon hunting one night with his trusted hound dog against the warnings of his wife something bad was going to happen. Well it did. Both he and his dog drown while on the hunt. The next morning he wakes up and figures he better get home before he gets in big trouble with his wife. When he gets home that is when he realizes he died during the night along with his dog. Now the question is will he go to heaven or hell. As he and his dog are walking along he comes across two men each at a different entrance. One leads to heaven, the other doesn't. Which one should he take? And what about his hound dog?

""The Self Improvement Of Salvadore Ross"" is next on the disc. A decent episode about a man who tries to improve his personality to become a better man to please the father of the woman he loves. Ross, played by Don Gordon, does grow personally as the story progresses leading to a somewhat of a surprise ending. As I said a decent episode but I would not list it as one of the best from the series.

Volume 25 ends with one of the truly classic episodes however ""Number 12 Looks Just Like You"". A young girl who looks plain compared to how everyone in society looks is sill happy with the way she looks. Problem is she is being pressured by her mother and friends to have plastic surgery so she will look like everyone else. She resists wanting to be different from all the others but the pressure she faces is high. This is one of those classic episodes from the ""Twilight Zone"" that looks at the individual looking to maintain their individuality while society pressures them to conform to what society considers normal.

This is one of those DVDs from the series that anyone who is a fan of the ""Twilight Zone"" will want to add to their video collection. This volume would also make a great introduction to anyone new to the series wanting to see some of the best stories the ""Zone"" had to offer.",1406592000,,2853,4.305400372439479
289993,3,6300270068,"The 22nd volume in the ""Twilight Zone"" series offers some good stories but nothing really special or that would be classified as classics.

The first story on the disc is ""A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE"" starring Howard Duff. Duff plays a man who we see entering an office with a secretary, a desk, a phone and three of four walls. That's where the story begins. Where the fourth wall should be is some cameras, some stage hands and a director. Arthur Curtis, Duff, believes he is a businessman with clients and a wife he is planning to go on vacation with. Or is he just an actor in a TV show? Curtis believes he is the former though everyone tells him otherwise. So which is truth and which fantasy? This is a decent episode. Maybe the best of the four on this disc.

The second story offers a subject that has been explored many times in the Zone, time travel. Titled ""BACK THERE"" it stars Russell Johnson who a couple of years later would be known as a professor stranded on a desert island with some people. Here though he is a member of a exclusive mens club who one night gets into a conversation with some of the members about traveling back in time. The discussion is if you would be able to change the course of events if you could. Johnson soon finds out as he leaves the building and finds he has gone back in time 100 years to the date of President Lincoln's assassination. Of course he believes he can change things to save the President's life or can he? The story is a bit predictable but still a decent one.

The third story is ""ONE MORE PALLBEARER"". A man who feels he had been wronged in the past by three people brings them together in his fall-out shelter offering them sanctuary there before the world will end if all they do is apologize for how they wronged him in his past. Kind of predictable and not that interesting. Not a bad episode just not very interesting.

The fourth and final story is ""RING-A-DING GIRL"". A home town girl makes it big in Hollywood. She receives as a gift a ring that seems to have the power to show her images of people she knows back home. When she sees an image of her sister in the ring she calls home. Her sister convinces her to come home for a visit. When she arrives things start out nice but soon she sees images of other people she knows from her home town and it is leading to events that could be tragic for the town. An OK episode.

For the diehard fan you will want to add this DVD to your TZ collection. For the casual fan or someone not that familiar with the series you may want to skip this one. There are much better discs in the series like volumes 2 or 3 or 6 that has some of the real classics from the ""Twilight Zone"".",1405814400,,2684,4.244618395303327

289996,3,6300270068,"Volume 18 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features three decent stories from the television series but none that would I consider classics. Still any fan of the show will want to add this disc to their collection.

It starts with ""I Shot An Arrow Into The Air"". An American spaceship crashes and three astronauts survive the disaster. Not sure where they are the men have a limited supply of food and water to survive with. One of the astronauts decides the best way to come out of the situation alive is to kill the other two. Of course this IS the Twilight Zone so you know there will be a twist to the plot somewhere.

The second story is one of the hour long episodes from the fourth season of the Zone and it stars Jack Klugman in one of the four episodes he would appear in on TZ during the run of the series. The title is ""Death Ship"". Another story about a spaceship crashing. While circling a planet the crew of spaceship notice something shining on the surface of that planet. Upon closer examination the crew (played by Klugman, Ross Martin and Fredrick Beir) discover what looks like their spaceship having crashed landed on the planet. What is discovered inside the spaceship makes Martin and Beir believe they are really dead. Klugman refuses to believe that but can he get the other two to listen to reason?

""Still Valley"" rounds out the DVD and is one of only two stories during the ""Twilight Zone"" involving the American Civil War (the other episode was ""The Passerby). Starring Gary Merrill is a Confederate scout who comes across a bunch of Union soldiers who are frozen still. He can't understand what they are that way till he meets an old man who tells him he stopped the soldiers in their tracks by using a magic spell on them from a book he has. The old man is dying and wants to give the book to Merrill to use on the Union army so the south will win the war. But then Merrill sees who the author of the book is and he will have to make an important decision.

These altogether are good stories but nothing great. Still this is a good volume to get for your collection. The acting is good and the stories are well written. For the more serious fan of the TZ you will want to add this volume no matter what. For the more casual fan there are other volumes out there with some of the more classic TZ episodes that will probably be more to your liking.",1404000000,,2377,4.3589164785553045
289997,3,6300270068,"Due to a misunderstanding of the item description on Amazon, I ordered it thiinking it was something else.  I'm keeping it because a friend can use the tape as a master to copty onto a DVD.",1403049600,,189,4.25
289998,4,6300270068,"While it has been 50 years since Twilight Zone went off the air the series I feel there has never been a television show since then that matches TZ for originality and creativeness. Volume 23 in the series of DVDs of Twilight Zone episodes demonstrate how good the show could get. Just about all of the four episodes on this disc could be labeled as classics from the show.

Certainly one of the most memorable episodes is the first one on the DVD ""Long Live Walter Jameson"". Starring Kevin McCarthy in the titled role he is a history teacher who really knows his stuff and makes history come alive to his students. That is because unknown to everyone he is ageless and has lived through much of the history he teaches. Unable to die Jameson has lived for centuries and lived through all the major historical events occurring during mans time. He has outlived every wife he has had and all his children and he is about to be married again. But the truth involving Jameson is revealed and he ends up paying the price. A great episode with great special effects.

""Dead Man's Shoes"" is the next episode and probably the weakest among the stories here. A gangster is killed on the street. A man witnesses the murder who is in need of some new shoes. He takes the shoes of the dead gangster and before he knows it the spirit of the dead man takes over control of him looking for revenge of his murder. It's an OK episode but kind of predictable.

""You Drive"" has always been one of my favorite stories from the Zone. Starring Edward Andrews as Oliver Pope he plays a man who one day while driving runs over a boy riding his bicycle and kills him. In a panic Pope drives off leaving the boy behind and hoping nobody saw what he did. But something did see what he did. His own automobile! And now it starts playing on Pope's conscience by honking its horn and starting up all by itself constantly reminding Pope what has happened. This is one of the all time best episodes I feel.

Last on the disc is ""The Long Morrow"". It is about an astronaut, played by Robert Lansing who going on a outer space voyage that will last 40 years. While training for the mission he meets a young woman, played by Mariette Hartley. What however will they do. He will be in space for 40 years in suspended animation while she will be back on Earth and aging 40 years. They both come up with a solution that should solve the problem or will it?

All in all this is a good DVD from the Twilight Zone series to add to your collection whether you are a die hard fan like me or a casual fan. The stories on here are suspenseful, creative and entertaining even if these stories are at least 50 years old!",1400544000,,2673,4.338
289999,4,6300270068,"Volume 30 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series has some good episodes on it. Not one of the best in the series but the stories in this disc will keep your attention.

It all begins with ""Jess-Belle"". From the fourth season when all the episodes of the ""Twilight Zone"" were an hour in length this is among the best stories from that season. While many of the stories from that season suffered from trying to pad the program to fill in the hour time period ""Jess-Belle"" really uses the whole 60 minutes to beautifully tell the story of a jealous girl who can't stand to see the man she loves marry another woman. To win the love she seeks she goes to a witch for a potion to win the heart of the man she loves. It works but only once it is too late does Jess-Belle, played by Anne Francis, come to realize what priced she paid. Written by Earl Hamner who would go on to create ""The Waltons"" and starring also James Best and Jeanette Nolan this is some great story telling.

Next to appear on the DVD is the very rarely seen program ""SOUNDS AND SILENCES"". It stars John McGiver as a man who owns a model ship building company. He also likes everything LOUD! Really loud. He can spend the day listening to record recording of famous Navel ship battles. He speaks using nautical terms and is unable to see his wife and employees would commit mutiny if it would stop all the loud noises he likes to listen to. Then suddenly something happens to McGiver's character that will change how he listens to things.

Finally rounding out the disc is ""CAESAR AND ME"". A down on his luck ventriloquist, played by Jackie Cooper, can't find work in his field of entertainment. With rent behind and desperate to make some extra money the dummy, named Ceasar, can talk and think on his own and plan things and with the ventriloquist help devises a plan to make money under a little less then legal way. Meanwhile a nosey little girl, played by a very young Morgan Brittany, is snooping around and listening in on the conversations between Caesar and Cooper and overhears what they planned. There is one other famous episode by ""Twilight Zone"" about a ventriloquist and his dummy titled ""The Dummy"". That is I think a much better story then ""Caesar and Me"". Still this is an interesting story to be sure but this episode isn't one of my favorites. Plus I could be wrong but I think the same dummy was used in both TZ episodes mentioned.

So there you have it. Whether you are a fan of ""Twilight Zone"" or some one not all that familiar with the show this DVD will provide some good viewing pleasure. It's not a strong one but I do recommend this DVD.",1400371200,,2625,4.40618556701031
290030,5,6300270068,"Volume 29 from the series of DVDs of the ""Twilight Zone"" feature four more great episodes from the show. All of them are near classics that are popular with the fans with memorable scenes and actors.

First up on the disc is ""A Nice Place to Visit"". A gangster named Rocky Valentine, played by Larry Blyden, is gunned down by police while he is trying to get away from them during a burglary. When he wakes up he finds he is still laying on the street with a man all in white standing there. The man who's name is Mr. Pip, played by Sebastian Cabot, is there to assist him. Pip takes Rocky to a home they got for him. Inside it is lavishly furnished and whatever Rocky wants Mr. Pip will get for him. Sounds like Heaven but then this IS the Zone.

Next up is ""A Penny For Your Thoughts"". It stars Dick York, best remembered for his role as Darren on ""Bewitched"", as a man while on his way to work stops to buy a newspaper. He flips a quarter into the box and the coin lands on its edge. A million to one chance of that happening as the man selling the papers notes. From there things get strange for the man. All of a sudden he seems to be able to read minds. Every ones minds from the person passing him on the street to his co-workers at the bank. It leads to a very interesting day of work for him to be sure. Certainly a day he won't forget.

The next story on the DVD is probably one of the most memorable one. One night the parents of a little girl awaken to the sound of their daughter calling out for them. They hear her but they can't see her. Anywhere. The episode is called  ""Little Girl Lost"". Turns out she fell out of bed onto the floor and into a hole that takes her to the fourth dimension. They call a friend who is a physicist who tries to help them before the hole she fell in closes up for good. Interesting note, this episode was written by Charles Beaumont who came up with the idea for the story after one night his own daughter fell out of bed and rolled under it. When she called out for help and he came into her bedroom he of course could not see her at first. While she did not fall into the fourth dimension she did give her father a great story idea.

Rounding out this volume is ""I Am the Night--Color Me Black"". A man is about to be executed for the murder of the town bigot. Nobody mourns the death of the victim but they do want their justice for the crime committed. As the town gets ready for the upcoming hanging a strange is occurring over the town. It is daytime, the sun should be up but it is pitch black outside. No one can explain it but the plans for the hanging keeps going forward. This is an episode that was written by Rod Serling and it is classic Serling with a story dealing with bigotry and racism and mans need for revenge. This episode is full of great actors too from Michael Constatine as the sheriff to Paul Fix as the towns newspaper editor to Ivan Dixon as the preacher to George Lindsay, yes that George Lindsay of Goober fame, as the deputy. A strong story with an important message.

Of all the individual volumes of the ""Twilight Zone"", and there are 43 altogether, this is one of the best around. For any fan of TZ or for someone who has never seen the show before this is a great DVD to add to your collection.",1399593600,,3275,4.133437990580847
290031,4,6300270068,"Volume 28 in the series of DVDs of the ""Twilight Zone"" has some good episodes on the disc. None would probably be considered classics but still good from the TV series. There are only three stories in this volume since one of the episodes is from the fourth season when all the shows were an hour in length.

First up is ""The Whole Truth"". Starring Jack Carson, Harvey Hunnicut is your typical used car dealer. That is you shouldn't believe anything he tells you about a car he is trying to sell. Then one day an old man with a Model A car shows up looking to sell it. Hunnicut decides to buy it and it is only after the sale is made that the old man reveals the car he just sold Hunnicut is haunted. How So? Harvey Hunnicut is about to find out. Trivia note. This episode premiered on January 20 1961, the same day John Kennedy was sworn in as President of the United States. During the episode Kennedy's name is mentioned in passing.

Second episode is the hour long program ""Mute"". There are a lot of fans of ""Twilight Zone"" who did not care for the fourth season when the stories were an hour in length. The main reason why was because they felt many of the stories were dragged out too much to be able to fit the hour long format which made those stories drag. Indeed some of those stories would have been a whole lot better if they were only a half hour in length. But while some of the hour long episodes were not so good there were some that were really good thanks to the story being an hour in length. ""Mute"" I feel falls somewhere in between. Not a really good episode but not a bad one either. It is slow a little bit in places and it is hard at times to understand why some of the characters behave the way they do but the plot is interesting enough to hold your attention. It stars a young Ann Jillian as a girl who was born in Germany to parents who were part of a group of people trying to develop telepathic powers to include reading minds and communicating to one another through mental telepathy instead of talking. So the little girl has never spoken. The girl and her parents immigrate to the U.S. and settle in near a small town where they keep to themselves. One night a fire at the house kills the parents but the girl survives. The sheriff, played by Frank Overton, in town brings the girl home where he and his wife take care of the girl while he tries to find out if there is family back in Germany of the girl's. Meanwhile the wife, played by Barbara Baxley, goes about raising the girl and trying to get her to speak. The girl in enrolled in school and the teacher also makes it her mission to get the girl to speak. Then one day a couple of people from Germany who are part of the group come to town to see how the girl in doing. It all leads to the climatic ending to the story and what will happen to the little girl. Again this is not a bad story I would just not count it among the better hour long episodes from season 4.

The last offering on this volume is ""Queen of the Nile"". Starring Ann Blyth as an actress, who's name is Pamela Morris, who says she is 38 years old. One problem. According to her film biography she starred in a movie back in the 1920's titled ""Queen Of The Nile"". If she starred in a film way back in the '20s then how could she be still so young now in the early 1960's? A Hollywood reporter, played by Lee Philips, is writing an article about her and is curious to how she could look so young and begins probing into her past. A conversation with Pamela Morris' daughter leads the reporter to find out how the actress is looking so young and it's not plastic surgery!

This is a good volume for any fan of the ""Twilight Zone"" to get. These episodes are not the best stories from the show but they are still entertaining to watch.",1398643200,,3790,4.1876712328767125

290073,5,6300270068,"Of all the volumes of DVDs that have been put together from the original ""Twilight Zone"" series volume 43 is a must have for any die hard fan of the series. It features 3 classic episodes from the series and one ok episode. It also features the only time on the series that Rod Serling interacts with the main character in a story which rates as one of the classic moments from the series.

The first episode on the DVD is also the first episode to ever appear on the ""Twilight Zone"" titled ""Where Is Everybody?"". It stars Earl Holliman who is the only person to appear in the story until the end. In the story Holliman finds himself in a deserted town. He doesn't know how he got there or what his name is. He slowly starts to remember little things about himself but can he remember everything before he slips into madness? What is interesting about this episode is while it is the first to appear on ""Twilight Zone"" this version of the story was not shown to the public. That is because this version was used to sell the idea of the series to both the television networks and to potential sponcers. As a result there are a couple of differences here. First is Rod Serling does not do the vocal intro to the episode or its ending as would become common in the series. Another person would speak the intro. It wasn't until the series was picked up by CBS that the idea of Serling doing the intros and endings to the stories was suggested. As a side trivia note, During the first season of ""Twilight Zone"" you only heard Rod's voice. Starting with the second season Rod Serling would start to appear at the beginning of each episode. That doesn't mean however you don't see Serling during this program. You do see him at first as he gives an intro describing what the series is about as he is trying to sell it to the television executives. It is certainly interesting to see and hear him talking about this new idea for a television series in hopes of selling it to one of the networks. This episode alone I feel makes this DVD worth five stars.

""The Eye Of The Beholder"" is the second offering from the ""Twilight Zone"" on this DVD. This is another one of those classic episodes that was written by Serling. In the story you see a woman but not her face as it is covered completely in bandages. She has a facial deformity and the doctors at the hospital have performed surgery to try to correct this deformity. Through out the episode you also don't see the faces of the doctors or nurses because either the light is very dark or it is hidden by someone or something to not let you see their faces. Not until you get to the end of the story do you get to see everyone's faces and the woman finds to her dismay the surgery didn't work. Trivia note here, while it is not her voice you hear as the woman is talking during the story it is Donna Douglas' face who you see at the end of the story when the bandages come off. She would of course go on to become famous playing Elly Mae on ""The Beverly Hillbillies"".

Third story on the disc is the one featuring Rod interacting with the main character in the story. The title is ""A World Of His Own"". In it Keenan Wynn plays Gregory West. A TV writer who doesn't write his scripts but dictates them instead onto a tape recorder. (side note, that is exactly how Rod Serling use to ""write"" his episodes for ""Twilight Zone"" although he did not write this one. This episode was written by Richard Matheson) As Gregory West describes his characters into the recorder the characters come to life as real people just as the way he describes them. One day his wife looks through the window to his office and sees another woman in the room with him. Assuming that he is having an affair with another woman she confronts Gregory about it. He tried to explain to his wife how he can make his characters come to life but of course she won't believe him. I don't want to give too much more here for the benefit of those who have not seen this episode but the interaction between Rod and Gregory takes place at the end when Rod gives his usual closing comments of the story just seen.

The last story is ""A Thing About Machines"". It stars Richard Hayden as a man who has issues with modern machines and devices. In a nutshell he hates them. Of course since this IS the ""Twilight Zone"" they hate him back. This is the ok episode I mentioned earlier. The story isn't bad and I do kind of like it but it is I find a tad too predictable episode. Hayden helps to save the episode a bit with his performance. Still this episode doesn't I feel rate as being a classic one compaired to the other three on this DVD.

All in all this is a very good volume of the ""Twilight Zone"" to add to your video collection. Especially if you are a fan of this series. For someone who is not familier with the show this volume will make an excellent introduction to the series.",1392163200,,4885,4.305434782608696

290076,5,6300270068,"Volume 21 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features some of the very best episodes from the show. Two of them I think would classify as classics but all four stories on this disc are strong with great writing, directing and most of all great actors on here.

It begins with  ""Mirror Image"". It stars Vera Miles and a young Martin Milner. In the story Miles plays a woman named Millicent Barnes who starts to wonder if she might be going crazy. It starts while at a bus station waiting for her bus to arrive. While waiting she starts to notice her bag has been moved around. Plus when she goes up to the booth to ask the guy behind the counter when her bus should arrive he tells her she just asked him that a couple of minutes ago. But she doesn't remember asking him that question a couple of minutes ago. Then she spots herself, or is it an exact double of her? She meets a young man named Paul Grinstead, played by Milner, who at first thinks she just might be a little crazy until he sees something. It ends with one of those TZ endings we all know and love. I would rate this as one of those classic episodes.

""Dust"" is the next offering on the DVD and while most people don't seem to care about this one too much I rate this as one of my fave episodes. It takes place in the old west where a young man is waiting to be hanged for the accidental death of a little girl he killed while driving a wagon drunk. The young man's father, played by Vladimir Sokoloff, meanwhile is looking for mercy from a town that wants justice. Then the Father meets a peddler who claims he has some magic dust that could save his son if the father can come up with the money. When the father leaves to try and come up with the money to buy the magic dust we see that the peddler is obviously scamming the father. But this IS the ""Twilight Zone"" where what happens can and will surprise you. While I would not say this is one of those classic episodes it is still to me a very strong one.

The other story on here that I think classifies as a classic as well as unique story is ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"". Question. What do a clown, a hobo, a ballerina, a Scottish bagpipe player and an Army Major have in common? Answer. Well there are two things. First they are all stuck in a large cylinder structure from which they don't know how they got there or how to get out. Second, well they are in the Twilight Zone. The story opens with the Army Major waking up to find himself in the cylinder with the other occupants. Of course the Major is a man of action and starts to try to figure a way out for all of them but every idea he comes up with is shot down by the others, especially the clown, because it had already been tried by them with no luck. One of the best parts to me with this episode is the dialog that takes place among everyone especially between the Major and the clown. Both parts are played brilliantly by William Windom as the Major and  Murray Matheson as the clown. This is ""Twilight Zone"" at its very best!

The last story to be told on the disc is not a classic but still a very good episode starring the much beloved actor Ed Wynn. It is  ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"". It is from the fifth and last season of ""Twilight Zone"". In it Wynn owns a grandfather clock and believes his life is connected to that clock. If the clock ever stops ticking then he will die. Of course he goes to great length to make sure the clock never runs down, even after he is talked into selling his clock to the next door neighbors. The ending is kind of predictable but still good. What helps to save the story is Ed Wynn himself who gives a very good performance.

This is a great volume of the ""Twilight Zone series to own if you are a fan and don't have this. I would rate this DVD as one of the better ones of the series of volumes and would definitely recommend this.",1389830400,,3875,4.164218958611482
290077,4,6300270068,"Volume 11 in the series of the Twilight Zone TV shows feature a couple of the classic episodes but all four episodes that appear on this DVD are really great and captivating to watch. There are some great actors who star in these stories as well which just makes them all the more enjoyable to watch.

The first episode to appear is ""The Dummy"" starring Cliff Robertson. Robertson is a ventriloquist who has a problem with his dummy. What is the problem? Well the dummy, named Willie, wants to run the act and sets out to do that. Robertson tries to stop the dummy but without saying anymore leads to one of the most shocking endings in the history of the ""Twilight Zone"".

""The Fever"", the next episode on the disc, is one of my favorite TZ stories dealing with the subject of what happens when a person gets addicted to something, in this case gambling. A woman wins a contest and the first place prize is a trip for her and her husband to Las Vegas. The husband is totally against the idea of coming to such a place but while displeased amuses his wife's desire to visit the town. However when she put a coin in a slot machine he puts his foot down until an unknown man gets him to put a coin in the slot. What follows after that is a classic case of addiction.

Next episode to follow is truly one of the classics from the show, ""Living Doll"". It stars a young Telly Savalas and a doll named Talky Tina. She is not a doll to be tampered with as Savalas is to find out. And she makes it clear from the start she does not like Savalas. The verbal sparring between Erich, Savalas, and Talky Tina leads to a final confrontation between the two of them that leads to a fateful conclusion. Trivia fact about this episode, June Foray who was the voice of ""Rocky the Flying Squirrel"" on ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" provides the voice for Talky Tina.

The last story is about a woman who goes to a department store to buy a thimble only to find out the floor in the store where she went up to buy the thimble suddenly does not exist. Confused by the whole thing it even gets worse for her when she discovers that saleslady who sold her the thimble is a mannequin. It stars Anne Francis and the episode is called ""The After Hours"". This is I would thing another one of those episodes that might be considered a classic one. Well written, directed and acted this is a pretty good suspenseful story with one of those endings with the classic TZ twist to it.

For anyone who is a serious fan of ""Twilight Zone"" this certainly is a must have volume to obtain. For someone who has never seen the series this would make a good introduction to the show for them.",1389139200,,2644,4.301204819277109

This time he is an unsuccessful trumpet player is given a second chance to get the recognition he so wanted. Jack Klugman is excellent in this episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Don Medford. Frank Wolff also has a nice little part. THE FOUR OF US ARE DYING is a compelling story about a man who can alter his face to look like anyone, but he somehow cannot escape his troubles.

290159,5,6300270068,"THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR is from the Second Season and it was filmed on video tape. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by Jack Smight. Inger Stevens plays a young woman and her father (John Hoyt) is a stickler for precision in every aspect of his life. That obsession for precision takes its toll upon their robot servant girl and has a devastating effect on Inger Steven. Thus, the conflict between them erupts with devastating reality. This is a classic episode and somehow that it was shot on video instead of film adds to stage like quality it captures. THE DUMMY from the Third season aired on May 4, 1962 and was written by Rod Serling. Cliff Robertson plays a down-and-out ventriloquist who has dilutions that his mannequin may be getting the better of him. This is interesting study into the mind of man and the man-made with a denouement that is riveting. It was was directed by Abner Bibberman.",1380412800,,912,4.601226993865031
290160,5,6300270068,"NUMBER 12 LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU from the Fifth Season is a rather prophetic episode written by Charles Beaumont. It deals with a young woman who believes she is physically unattractive,yet rejects treatments that will make her physically flawless like the rest of the people in the society who surgically create facades, both physically and mentally, of lookalike people. THE HUNT is another homespun tale written by Earl Hamner, Jr. about a hunter (Arthur Hunnicut) and his dog who are killed while stalking their prey. When they get to the Gates of Heaven, they must deal with Saint Peter. Or is it Saint Peter? This is a good episode directed by Harold Schuster. THE SELF IMPROVEMENT OF SALVADORE ROSS from the Fifth Season and written by Henry Selsar and Jerry McNelley. It has Don Gordon as a man who transform his personality to meet the desires of his daily life. He is a rather callous fellow, but when he finally feels some true passion of real love and tenderness and caring his past personalities get in the way. This is a very interesting episode in retrospect and it was very well directed Don Siegal. EXECUTION is a classic episode from the First Season written by Rod Serling and directed by Ron Winston. The setting is the old west at the moment of a hanging to take place in few more seconds. Albert Salmi is the man with the nose around his neck. He is suddenly snatched and catapulted to a modern day big city with neon lights and honking horns. The transition of time and place and its effect on Salimi is interesting and very amusing to watch. However, it eventually becomes apparent that a modern day scientist is responsible for this time and place travel. The ending reveals even more. This is a great episode.",1380326400,3,1732,4.663398692810458
290161,5,6300270068,"THE FEAR, from the Fifth Season is my favorite here. It was written by Rod Searling and directed by Ted post. It is a study in fear and perhaps loneliness and has only two characters staring Hazel Court and Mark Richman. Hazel Court is a fashion editor from New York City and she has come west to a remote cabin surrounded by trees miles away from the nearest town. Mark Richman is a state trooper investigating a report of strange lights in the sky. Court tries to dismiss Richman as a local country bumpkin, a cracker barrel lawman, who is out of his element. But that is not the case. Richman is an educated man who quotes Shakespeare and he subtly puts her in her place. She has lived with fear her whole life as she finally admits to Richman. But, sudenlly that are confronted with strange lights and unexplainable events and they together must face their own fear and confront reality. THE BARD is a bit of a hoot from the Fourth Season. A miserable writer (Jack Weston) must come up with a television script and he get none other than the ghost of William Shakespeare (John Williams) to write it, but Shakespeare will not go along with the casting of a young Burt Reynolds to play the lead. It was written by Rod Searling and directed by David Butler. THE BEWITCHIN' POOL, from the Fifth Season, is a great homespun tale of two children who escape via their built-in swimming pool to another place to escape their arguing parents who are on the verge of a divorce. It was written by Earl Hamner, Jr. and directed by Joseph Newman. This episode has a very tranquil fairy tale backwoods quality about it.",1380240000,2,1609,4.494880546075085
290162,5,6300270068,"THE SIXTEEN-MILLIMETER SHRINE is an absolute classic. I love this one. It plays like an old film from a time long forgotten. Ida Lupino is a former movie queen who lives in the past constantly screening her old movies. She loses touch with reality and the ending is very haunting. Ida Lupino and Martin Balsam, as her agent, give excellent and very realistic performances. This is one of best Twilight Zone episodes from the First Season. It was written by  Rod Serling and meticulously directed by Mitch Leisen. THE HITCH-HIKER is another haunting episode about a woman (Inger Stevens) who is driving cross-country and continually sees the same lonely and strange looking hitch-hiker on the road ahead. This is a eerily frightening episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Alvin Ganzer. It is a classic well remembered episode.",1380153600,,834,5.0
290163,5,6300270068,"ONE FOR THE ANGELS is an absolute classic from the First Season as Ed Wynn, a sidewalk salesman, must make the greatest pitch of his life to save a little girl from Mr. Death, played brilliantly by Murray Hamilton. Rod Serling wrote this one and it was directed by Robert Parish in a very tender way.

THE INVADERS is a great study in isolation and the unknown written by Richard Matheson, directed by Douglas Heyes and staring Agnes Moorehead in this classic one character episode. Brilliant stuff!

EYE OF THE BEHOLDER says it all. Janet Tyler will have to have her bandages removed from her face to reveal if the operation was a success or not. But, there is more than meets the eye to that question and Bernard Herrmann's score brilliantly sets the mood for this very powerful study into the human psyche. Bold cinematography by George T. Clemens and a classic script from Rod Serling. It was effectively directed Douglas Heyes.

THE LONELY is one of Rod Serling's classics from the series. Jack Warden convincingly plays a convict sentenced to forty years alone on a distant asteroid. A periodic supply ship commanded by John Dehner one day leaves him a companion, a robot played flawlessly by Jean Marsh. Bernard Herrmann's poignant score evokes the enigmatic inner feeling of Jack Warden's love for his companion. And subsequently Herrmann's score captures the human quality of this female robot as she reciprocates that love. The combination of scripting, acting and scoring realistically captures our perceptions of loneliness, love, loss and reality.",1380153600,,1560,4.992307692307692

290165,5,6300270068,"LITTLE GIRL LOST written by Richard Matheson and directed by Paul Stewart deals realistically with a breach in the time-space continuum found in a little girl's bedroom where in a wall a portal to another dimension has opened. The little girl cries out in desperate echoes for help for she and her dog have gone through the portal where she is now lost and all concepts of time and space as we know them do not exist from our point of view. This is a fascinating story. The parents are aided by a scientist friend (Charles Aidman). The strong cast is comprised of Sarah Marshall, Robert Sampson, and Tracy Stratford. Bernard Herrmann's score written specifically for LITTLE GIRL LOST forgoes the sentimentality and jumps right into the menace capturing the confusion and a curious wonderment of a multi dimensional world that the little girl and her dog are now lost in.

A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS written by George Clayton Johnson and directed by James Sheldon features Dick York as a man who tosses a coin buying a newspaper that lands on edge and he soon finds that one in a million chance has given him the ability to hear other peoples thoughts. Dick York is very good and very memorable in this episode.

A NICE PLACE TO VISIT written by Charles Beaumont and directed by John Brahm is from the first season with Larry Blyden, Sebastion Cabot and Sandra Warner. Larry Blyden is over the top as a gangster after being shot and killed finds himself in a world where he gets everything he wants. Sebastion Cabot is his would be mentor and he introduces him to the opulence of his new life with interesting repercussions.

I AM THE NIGHT - COLOR ME BLACK written by Rod Serling and directed by Abner Biberman features Michael Constatine, Paul Fix, George Lindsay, Terry Becker, Ivan Dixon in this tale where the sun fails to come up in a town out west where a man is going to be executed for killing a bigot. Paul Fix is very good as the local newspaperman who is convinced that man to be executed is innocent. Ivan Dixon, the black preacher, delivers words in a sermon on this day. The statement on bigotry and racism is quite clear in this episode.",1379808000,,2151,4.567357512953368

JUDGMENT NIGHT from the First Season features Nehemiah Persoff, as a passenger aboard a freighter during wartime who becomes obsessed that the ship will be sunk by 1:15 am. It is a very ominous and atmospheric episode and plays out very well beginning with Bernard Herrmann's opening title music. Patrick McNee and James Franciscus are also featured.",1379808000,,695,4.889830508474576

As for being memorable, WILL THE REAL MARTIAN PLEASE STAND UP is one of the most remembered and identified episodes. Written by Rod Serling with an original airdate of May 26, 1961 it is the story that takes place in a diner where passengers of a bus trip are stranded. There's only one problem: one of the passengers may be an alien in disguise!",1379808000,,691,4.528
290198,5,6300270068,"MIRROR IMAGE (February 26, 1960, Episode 21) written by Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm is interesting stuff. In this interesting and unsettling episode Vera Miles is a woman whose sense of reality is shattered when she encounters her exact double in a bus station. And so it goes.

DUST (January 6, 1961, Episode 48) is another great Western episode written by Rod Serling with Thomas Gomez, Vladimir Sokoloff, John Alonso and John Larch. On the day of his hanging, a man's father is conned by a obnoxious traveling salesman who sells him ""magic dust"" capable of eliminating hate. Is the dust simply a handful of dirt or is it something more?

FIVE CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN EXIT (December 22, 1961, Episode 79) written by Rod Serling and directed by Lamont Johnson is another classic and memorable episode. In this surreal episode, five people try to figure a way to escape from a large cylindrical container that they are trapped in. They each come from five very dissimilar walks of life. They each have no memory of who they are or how they came to be there. The cast is very strong here and very much makes this episode work. They are William Windom, Murray Matheson, Susan Harrison, Kelton Garwood, Clark Allen, Mona Houghton and Carol Hill.

NINETY YEARS WITHOUT SLUMBERING (December 20, 1963, Episode 132) written by George C. Johnson is an interesting episode with Ed Wynn as he plays an old man who is convinced that his life will end the moment his grandfather's clock breaks down.

290199,5,6300270068,"""The Whole Truth"" is amusing. ""Mute"" with Ann Jillian is excellent. ""Queen of the Nile"" with Ann Blyth and Lee Philips is very good. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. However, ""The Twilight Zone"" still endures the passage of time.",1379721600,,638,5.085714285714285
290200,5,6300270068,"There is something very sensual about the long ""The Long Morrow"" and it seems to grow ever more intimate with time. ""The Long Morrow"" was written by Rod Serling and directed by Robert Fleury. Suspended animation, a forty year space probe and the woman he loves back on earth. Robert Lansing is the astronaut Mariette Hartley is the woman he falls in love with shortly before his launch. The scenes between Robert Lansing and Mariette Hartley are sheer poetry. It is a story of love with irony ahead. The conclusion is heartbreaking. George MacReady and Edward Binns in their roles really bolster the dramatic effect of this story.

""Long Live Walter Jameson"" is a classic episode from the first season with Kevin McCarthy, Edgar Stehli, Estelle Winwood and Dody Heath. Charles Beaumont wrote this very thought provoking and unnerving episode about a history professor named Walter Jameson who is an expert on the Civil War simply because he was there. Or was he?  ""It's death that gives this world its point. We love a rose because we know it'll soon be gone. Whoever loved a stone?"" ~ Walter Jameson

""Dead Man's Shoes"" is interesting and memorable episode. Warren Stevens is a derelict who finds the shoes of a dead gangster. He puts on the shoes and he finds himself following literally in the footsteps of the dead man's life. This is classic Twilight Zone written by Charles Beaumont and directed by Montgomery Pittman. Warren Stevens gives one of his best performances.

""You Drive"" was written by Earl Hamner, Jr. and has Edward Andrews as a man haunted by harassed by his own car he kills a man in a hit and run accident. A good one.",1379721600,,1641,4.7272727272727275
290201,5,6300270068,"What can I say here, after ""Walking Distance"" and ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" I would say the ""The 7th is Made up of Phantoms"" is my next favorite episode. I love the story, the characters and dialogue written by Rod Serling here. Once again I get this feeling of Rod Serling's love for the past and fond memories from our childhood. There are echoes, haunting echoes from the past calling out to the present. Let's take one more ride on that merry-go-round of heroes and glory. The stuff our youth was made up perhaps. Another time another place. Perhaps these men, circa 1964, part of a National Guard mechanized unit out on maneuvers in open country in their Stewart tank near the Little Big Horn will come face to face with the inevitable past and glory. These grown men (Ron Foster, Warren Oates and Randy Boone) will go down in history as they come face to face and encounter the spirits of General Custer's 7th Cavalry and the Sioux nation at Custer's Last Stand. This is a great episode and Warren Oates is just an amazing actor who tries to bring a posture of reason and reality to this episode only to be outdone by the phantoms of the 7th Cavalry. Robert Bray is also excellent as the Captain in charge and Greg Morris as his driver who makes a startling observation at the conclusion of this episode. ""Sergeant William Connors, Trooper Michael McCluskey, and Trooper Richard Langsford, who, on a hot afternoon in June, made a charge over a hill - and never returned. Look for this one under 'P' for phantom, is a historical ledger located in a reading room known as the Twilight Zone.""

John Dehner is excellent in ""The Jungle"" another psychological drama written by Charles Beaumont based on irrational fear. I like this tale of a rather sophisticated and educated contractor (John Dehner) who has violated certain African tribal lands. This episode plays on your own personal paranoia for what is seen and unseen, what is written and unwritten, what is natural and what is spiritual. When two opposite sides of the coin meet then we come face to face with our fears. The episode is timeless.

""A Most Unusual Camera"" with Fred Clark and written by Rod Serling once again is another tale of a device that can tell the future. It was leisurely directed by John Rich. It could have been better.

""Uncle Simon"" is a bit over the top and somewhat silly, but I actually found myself watching this the other day and enjoying it. How times time passes. It was interesting to see how Sir Cedric Hardwicke would take revenge on Constance Ford even after his death. Amazingly this was directed by Don Siegal from Rod Serling's story.

290202,5,6300270068,"""The Fugitive"" written by Charles Beaumont and directed by Richard L. Bare featuring J. Pat O'Malley, Susan Gordon, Nancy Kulp, Wesley Lau, Paul Tripp, Stephen Talbot, Johnny Eiman, Russ Bender is a tender story of an alien fugitive named Old Ben who comes to the planet to help a crippled little girl. This is writer Charles Beaumont's kind of story. It is a good one.

""Once Upon A Time"" written by Richard Matheson and directed by Norman Z. McLeod featuring Buster Keaton, Stanley Adams, Gil Lamb, James Flavin, Michael Ross, Milton Parsons, George E.

CAESAR AND ME written by A. T. Strassfield is a tour-de-force of underplaying a role by Jackie Cooper. This is a story about a ventriloquist's dummy comes to life and offers his master some pretty unusual advice. It is both amazing and introspective.

JESS-BELLE written by Earl Hamner, Jr. and directed by Buzz Kulik is about a woman sells her soul to the Devil to recapture the love of a former suitor. Anne Francis is the Jess-Belle and is very sultry and alluring to James Best's unwitting suitor.

SOUNDS AND SILENCES is one of the most memorable episodes from the series. The Rod Serling directed by Richard Donner has John McGiver giving another wonderful performance as a very obnoxious obese fellow whose deafening voice and demeanor bring him face to face with his own comeuppance",1379721600,,945,4.820987654320987
290204,5,6300270068,"I just wanted to come back and hear the calliope. WALKING DISTANCE is my favorite Twilight Zone episode. For me WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best episode ever produced. Gig Young acts out Serling's prose so perfectly that he speaks for every man that ever wished he could go home again. Very moving. Bernard Herrmann's score intuitively picks up the emotion and heartfelt sincerity that Serling wrote into this story. This was Rod Serling's, Bernard Herrmann's and Gig Young's finest work for any medium. I think it is the finest piece of work ever put on film.

Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. However, ""The Twilight Zone"" still endures. WALKING DISTANCE will remain in the heart forever.",1379721600,,1103,5.06043956043956

Joseph Wiseman is brilliant as always in his own subtle way. This is a very good and much forgotten episode.

BACK THERE written by Rod Serling and directed by David Orrick McDearmon features Russel Johnson and Paul Hartman. A man finds himself back in time just before the assassination of President Lincoln. Can he prevent it?

A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE Written by Richard Matheson and directed by Ted Post has Howard Duff as a business man who slowly finds that he is actually an actor tapped in the role of that business man and that his entire world is only a set for a film in which he has become a character. This is mind blowing and Howard Duff finally gets a chance to demonstrate what great range as an actor he truly had.

RING-A-DING GIRL written by Earl Hamner, Jr. is a bit of hokum, a libation off sorts with Maggie McNamara as movie star Bunny Blake who has the ability to save her hometown as by her strange ring. It is a strange offbeat episode but it remains alluring once seen.",1379721600,,1233,4.446902654867257

290248,4,6300270068,"""Mirror Image"", from The Twilight Zone's wonderful first season, is one of the series' quintessential and unforgettable episodes.  It exudes an atmosphere of loneliness and existential dread that were the special province of The Twilight Zone.  The tale of a young woman who encounters her doppelganger while waiting for a bus late on a rainy November night is told to perfection through tight writing (Rod Serling), evocative direction and photography (John Brahm and George Clemens, respectively), and above all an intense, dramatically urgent performance from the classy Vera Miles.  The episode is pregnant with metaphorical meaning; once seen, it will lodge in your memory.

""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"", inspired by Pirandello's play ""Five Characters in Search of an Author"" is a well-known and favorite Twilight Zone episode, but to me it has always seemed pretentious and, in its twist ending, disappointing and not a little silly.

An unjustly maligned episode (because its ending was rewritten) is ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"", from season 5, the story of an old man who believes that he will die if his grandfather clock stops.  Despite the changed ending, the episode still emerges as a gentle meditation on time and mortality.

290250,5,6300270068,"""The Bard"" is a black comedy which stars character actor Jack Weston as an incapable aspiring writer who conjures up William Shakespeare's spirit to 'ghost-write' a television script that will be bought. John Williams excellently portrays Shakespeare and the script finds its way into the hands of sponsors. There is a rehearsal at which we find a young Burt Reynolds as a Brando ringer. ""The Fear"" stars Mark Richman (who will narrate The Invaders series (1967-68) for ABC) as a state trooper who comes calling to a worried Hazel (""Devil Girl from Mars"") Court, concerned about an entity present in her cabin's area. ""The Bewitchin' Pool"" is the very last episode of this series- two children are disturbed at their parents' dysfunctional marriage, only to discover an outlet from the stress via their swimming pool- an entrance into a pacifist environment for children.

Gary Crosby, son of Bing, portrays Floyd Burney, a rockabilly star (Roy Orbison and 50s Elvis) who finds money has no power in the backwoods and a song he wants for himself seals his fate. ""Will the Real Martian Stand Up?"" is also a nice scifi tale with John Hoyt and Barney Phillips in a country diner. ""The Changing of the Guard"" reunites Donald Pleasence's boys' school professor with deceased students from his earlier days who prove he was a dedicated educator to them.

290257,4,6300270068,"Four exceptional episodes from THE TWILIGHT ZONE occupy this, the 43rd and final volume of the DVD compilations of the show.  3 of the episodes are amongst my all-time favourites and illustrate the versatility of the series' tone and flavour within the stories told.

EYE OF THE BEHOLDER (Season 2, Episode #6) is one of the most subversive stories in the ""Zone""'s history.  Janet Tyler is evidently horribly disfigured and awaiting the outcome of an operation that promises to make her look ""just like everyone else"".  Donna Douglas, the pert blonde star of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" adds an extra dimension to the lead role.  Chilling stuff.

A THING ABOUT MACHINES (Season 2, Episode #4) stars Richard Haydn as Bartlett Finchley, a reclusive bachelor with a violent hatred of technology.  This episode also explores the increasing impact that technology imposes in our everyday lives - whether we want it or not.  Woe betide the irritable Bartlett Finchley when his appliances, tired of being smashed and kicked, want revenge...

A WORLD OF HIS OWN (Season 1, Episode #36) is the breath of fresh air on this DVD.  One of the ""Zone""'s most delightful comedy stories, it stars Keenan Wynn as Gregory West, an author who can literally summon his fictional characters into the real world simply by dictating into his tape recorder.  When he cannot convince his wife Victoria (Phyllis Kirk) that the beautiful blonde (Mary La Roche) that he was seen canoodling with on the sofa is just a figment of his imagination, Gregory reveals that Victoria herself is also just a piece of tape...

290290,5,6300270068,"Of any volume of The Twilight Zone series, this ranks best among 4 classic episodes filled with suspense. My favorite here is ""Living Doll"" featuring Telly Savalas[A dozen years before becoming Kojak] as Erich Strater, a man becomes jealous of his step-daughter's new doll, Talky-Teena, then even more paranoid when the doll starts saying threatening things to him besides opening its eyes fully wide with the step-daughter is not present and tries his best in every way to get rid off it by throwing it out or even destroying it before returning it to his step-child then being met with the most dramatic end of all. In ""The Fever"" a character named Franklin Gibbs, who is tight-fisted and highly objects to his wife's winning vacation to Las Vegas then much his reluctance, he gets to play a slot machine and suddenly becomes addicted to it after winning on the first spin. Not only that he becomes haunted by the machine when it starts calling out his name before meeting a fatal conclusion. Cliff Robertson appears in ""The Dummy"" as a ventriloquist who becomes haunted by Willie, his dummy. He tries out other dummies in order to break away from the harrowing Willie before getting into a dramatic alteration at the epsode's closing scene. Finally, there's ""The After Hours"" when a customer portrayed by Anne Francis returns a gold thimble to a department store on a floor that doesn't exist only to find that the person who sold it to her is actually-a mannequin. Then it turns out the customer herself would be a mannequin for all but one month of a year. This set doesn't get any more spook-tacular than this.

The sound and picture are fine and it pretty much succeeds in bringing back childhood memories of watching this.",1357084800,,258,4.886363636363637
290293,3,6300270068,"Volume 42 of the TWILIGHT ZONE contains three stories, THE BARD, which is a 1-hour story featuring Jack Weston, THE FEAR, a 30-minute story, and THE  BEWITCHIN' POOL, another 30-minute story.  Jack Weston is a first-rate actor, having performed in the following movies (among others):Please Don't Eat the Daisies (1960); The Honeymoon Machine (1961; The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964; The Cincinnati Kid (1965); Mirage (1965; Wait Until Dark (1967; The Thomas Crown Affair (1968); The April Fools (1969; Cactus Flower (1969; A New Leaf (1971); Gator (1976); The Ritz (1976).

In THE BARD, Mr. Weston plays a failed screenwriter.  He obnoxiously and persistently persuades management of a company to produce his various screenplays for movies.  Unfortunately, none of his movies succeeded.  But THE BARD concerns a twist, where Mr. Weston visits a used bookstore, and picks up a book on the occult.  Using this book, Mr. Weston succeeds in reviving William Shakespeare from the dead, and Mr. Shakespeare writes a winning script for Mr. Weston.  The story has a decent surprising ending.  The actors include two editors for the movie script company, one of which was is an actor who looks like Howard MacNear, and the other is the actual Howard MacNear.  Howard MacNear is famed for playing Floyd the Barber. At any rate, THE BARD is worth, perhaps THREE or FOUR STARS.

THE FEAR concerns a female fashion magazine writer from New York City who decides to live in a rural cottage to recover from a nervous breakdown.  THE FEAR also stars a male actor who is a state trooper.  The issue is that, during the night, the woman hears strange noises, the trees near her cottage get broken, there are strange lights at night, and the state trooper's vehicle gets turned over, and then gets righted, and the vehicle gets large fingerprints on it.  At any rate, at about the two thirds point in this episode, we see the responsible party, and it turns out to be a 100-foot cyclops martian.  The state trooper fires on the martian, and it deflates, because it is only a balloon.  THE FEAR uses plot elements from THE INVADERS (episode 15), which I consider to be the very worst of all of the T.Z. stories.  The problem with THE INVADERS, is that there is only one acter, and she speaks no lines, but instead only makes grunts and shrieks during the entire story.  THE FEAR also uses a plot element taken from THE LITTLE PEOPLE (episode 93), which is one of the ""average"" T.Z. stories.  The script in THE FEAR is on the stagey side, that is, the writing is didactic and overly dramatic, like journalism.  Viewers will enjoy detecting a discrepency.  The 100-foot cyclops was determined to be responsible for the overturned automobile, and to be responsible for the large fingerprints on the car, but the cyclops was also determined to be only a balloon. THREE STARS at most.

THE BEWITCHIN' POOL is about a wealthy couple and their two children  The wealthy couple do not get along together.  The husband and wife are both drama queens, and they are mean to each other.  They are also both mean to their children.  The two children both have ""southern accents.""  I suppose that the southern accents were used to lend variety to the story.  Early in the story, the two children learn that they can dive into their family swimming pool and arrive at a pleasant farm, run by an elderly women, where the elderly woman takes care of dozens of children who have escaped from their mean parents.  This particular theme was beautifully utilized in the classic story, THE WATER BABIES, written by Charles Kinsley and published in 1863.  Other T.Z. episodes that deal with traveling to ""the other side"" include A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY and LITTLE GIRL LOST. In A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY, an overworked advertising man falls asleep on the commuter train and is able to visit an idyllic American town from the 1800s.  In LITTLE GIRL LOST, a girl is able to dissolve into a wall to an empty realm, and her parents try to reach through the dissolving spot in the wall, and try to grab their daughter.  A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY is one of the most perfectly written, and most perfectly acted, of all of the T.Z. episodes.  A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY is a great cultural gift to mankind.  But THE BEWITCHIN' POOL, at least to seasoned viewers of T.Z., will seem to be predictable and derivative.  The southern accents were distracting, and at least in my mind, raised the issue of authenticity of the accents.  THREE STARS at most.

Volume 42 is fine for the T.Z. completist, but it is not suitable as a gift. Volume 42 is somwhat below average for the T.Z. discs.  To reiterate what every baby-boomer already knows, the best T.Z. episodes include: TO SERVE MAN, KICK THE CAN, A GAME OF POOL, A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY, PIANO IN THE HOUSE, NIGHT CALL, CAVENDER IS COMING, PRINTER'S DEVIL, WALKING DISTANCE, PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN, NIGHTMARE AT 20,000 FEET, WHAT'S IN THE BOX, STEEL, THE SHELTER, NICK OF TIME, and a few others.",1353628800,2,4974,4.734030197444832

290296,5,6300270068,"I have always found the hour long Twilight Zone episodes from the fourth season rather interesting. They certainly are a mixed bag. Such is the case here with ""Death Ship"" written by Richard Matheson. Three astronauts land on a remote planet and find the remains of their ship and their lifeless bodies inside. Their captain, played by Jack Klugman, is certain there is some scientifically credible reason for this and they are not dead as the other two astronauts are so convinced of. Jack Klugman gives a very stoic performance here, much out of character from most of his roles. For me, it is Klugman's performance that makes this episode more than intriguing.

""I Shot an Arrow Into the Air,"" written by Rod Serling deals with three astronauts who crash land on an asteroid. Or did they? They went off the radar tracking screens and were unable to contact mission control. Desolate are their surroundings and only five gallons of water to ration out if and when they are found. That is their predicament.  One of the astronauts portrayed by the very talented and recognizable character actor Dewey Martin has other ideas. Sophisticated viewers are probably way ahead of this episode's plot, but it is still interesting to watch this study in deception, paranoia and survival.

My favorite is the Civil War episode ""Still Valley"" by Rod Serling. A Confederate scout played by the crag faced Gary Merrill reconnoiters a town held by Union troops who are all frozen in their tracks as if time had stopped. Sinister forces are at work here with a spell from a book of black magic from an old man who suggests that Merrill use this force to destroy the entire Union army. That is the moral dilemma set before Merrill. The images of the frozen Union soldiers are a bit unsettling and are rather haunting. Thought provoking stuff from The Twilight Zone.",1335225600,,1850,4.793103448275862
290297,5,6300270068,"""Where is Everybody"" endearingly introduces the running theme, the very spirit, of what defines the Twilight Zone. A man alone (Earl Holliman) finds himself totally isolated in an unfamiliar town, yet with very familiar surroundings found in any ""Hometown America"" setting. But, who is he, where is he and why is he there?

 ""Eye Of The Beholder"" says it all. Janet Tyler will have to have her bandages removed from her face to reveal if the operation was a success or not. But, there is more than meets the eye to that question and Bernard Herrmann's score brilliantly sets the mood for this very powerful study into the human psyche.

I always loved ""A Thing About Machines"" and that probably should credited to insightful scriptwriting, Richard Hayden's brilliant performance and actually some very impressionable visions depicted here of machines taking on an actual persona and turning on Hayden. In today's world, I wonder if we are actually at this point considering the supposed advances of technology in this day and age.

""A World Of His Own"" is another favorite of mine and this episode somehow seems timeless. For anyone who puts pen and ink to paper and creates characters that traverse a world they create in the mind, this should be a welcome episode.  Keenan Wynn does just that, though using a Dictaphone, in the comfortable surroundings of his den. Keenan Wynn's creations however become reality in this light comedy. This episode is thoroughly enjoyable, very memorable and quite ingenious. It also has a very unique ending that I must not give away.

Well, that's it for now. I decided to start reviewing Twilight Zone episodes again somewhere back there where I left off. I cannot say enough about the Twilight Zone. It is part of us, those who grew up with it and those who have found it along the way. Always thought provoking, always captivating, always endearing to the inquisitive mind.",1334793600,,1912,4.904024767801857

290360,5,6300270068,"This disc includes the classic episode, ""Jess-Belle,"" which was slightly out of the ordinary for Rod Serling.  (The other two episodes are run-of-the mill re-treads.)

""Jess-Belle"" was written by Earl Hamner, who created the long-running ""The Waltons,"" and in ""Jess-Belle,"" he brings all of the superstitions and legends of life in Depression-era Appalachia to the forefront.

Ann Francis is wonderful, and James Best (later to gain ""fame"" of sorts for his clownish role in ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") is perfect as the naive good ol' country boy, all too ready to be ""witched"" by Jess-Belle.

But, it is Jeanette Nolan who steals the show as Granny Hart.  ""Give him a witch's love"" is her advice to Jess-Belle, and that has left three generations of men wondering exactly what a ""witch's love"" is.  Like Billy Bob (Best), I would like to know!  Nolan's portrayal was worthy of Shakespeare.  Truly memorable and iconic.  Nolan deserved an emmy.

290409,4,6300270068,"Three choice episodes from Rod Serling's THE TWILIGHT ZONE, including the rare comedy story ""Cavender is Coming"", starring Carol Burnett.

Intended to serve as the pilot for a possible sitcom, ""Cavender is Coming"" is a charming episode, chiefly for the performance of Ms Burnett, who plays an accident-prone young woman who is sent a guardian angel, the Cavender of the title, played by Jesse White.  Contrary to belief, the show would have been a starring vehicle not for Ms Burnett, but instead Jesse White, who'd play the hapless guardian angel to a different person in each episode.  For whatever reason, the show never got off the ground, and what remains is one of the ZONE's rare all-out comedy stories.  It originally aired with a laugh track, but that has been removed for this DVD presentation.

Part of the hour-length fourth season, ""Passage on the Lady Anne"" is a touching meditation on the mystery of death, and it reunited Serling with his ""Nothing in the Dark"" star Dame Gladys Cooper, who features in a supporting role.  Longtime sitcom mainstay Richard Deacon (""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Mothers-in-Law"") is in peak skill for the man-versus-machine ""Brain Center at Whipple's"".

Episodes:

""Cavender is Coming"" (Season Three, Episode #36) - Carol Burnett stars as Agnes Grep in this tale of a klutzy usherette, ""rescued"" from poverty by Harmon Cavender (Jesse White), a guardian angel trying to earn his wings.

""Passage on the Lady Anne"" (Season Four, Episode #17) - In an effort to save their marriage, a young couple (Lee Philips and Joyce Van Patten) book passage on an old ship, which long ago was reserved for lovers.  Former passengers, now all over 75, have gathered for her final mysterious voyage.

""The Brain Center at Whipple's"" (Season Five, Episode #33) - Callous factory owner Wallace Whipple (Richard Deacon) automates his plant, putting thousands of men out of work.  Smugly self-satisfied, he has no regrets...at first.

The regular extras are included (short essays for each episode, a season-by-season breakdown of the show, and Rod Serling's bio).",1288137600,,2090,5.076023391812866
290410,5,6300270068,"I had the unfortunate experience recently of having known a little girl who was drowned in September of 2010 in a bathtub. It was horrible for everyone who knew this little girl. For her this review is dedicated and for her is the reason I thought to buy this particular 'Zone','Little Girl Lost'.
  'Little Girl Lost' has always been my very favorite 'Twilight Zone'. Not so much because it's about a lost child, but because it's about other dimensions and about physics.
  Defying the laws of matter and force, a little girl tumbles out of bed and rolls into a different dimension. She is immediately joined by the family dog who instinctively tracks her whereabouts. her distraught parents can neither see her or feel her but they can hear her and the little dog. Not knowing what to do, they call a neighbor who is a physicist.
  This is interesting since it was much more common to find people in 1950's America who worked in the field of physics and science than it is today. Studies today report that the number of Americans in that field has been greatly reduced. How sad. obviously people in the 50's were somewhat smarter. We might seem more liberal, but people were smarter and more educated then.
  What unfolds is a kind of ""little girl in the woods"" fable that depicts some basics of other dimensions and the simple understandings we had back then. I believe this was all before anyone had even concieved of a worm hole. And definitely before anyone discovered black holes.
  The physicist even makes a map on the wall that looks like chart I have seen by physicist on the Discovery channel on the subject.
  The whole thing is thought provoking and is what makes the original 'Zone' so good. 'Little Girl Lost' is a true television classic.

290411,4,6300270068,"Three more bewitching episodes from Rod Serling and THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  After having starred in the classic ""After Hours"", Anne Francis returned as the title character in ""Jess-Belle"", a haunting 'hillbilly fairytale' about a young woman who makes a pact with a witch in order to marry her sweetheart.  ""Jess-Belle"" was part of the hour-length fourth season, and greatly benefits from the extra time in which to spin out it's fascinating premise.  The other two episodes are fine but come from the patchy final season, and neither quite match ""Jess-Belle"" in their overall execution.

Episodes:

""Jesse-Belle"" (Season Four, Episode #7) - Billy-Ben Turner (James Best) finds himself enchanted by the beautiful Jess-Belle (Anne Francis), who soon learns the danger of buying a love spell from old witch Granny Hart (Jeanette Nolan).

""Sounds and Silences"" (Season Five, Episode #27) - Roswell G. Flemington (John McGiver) is a boisterous man who loves noise.  But when his wife (Penny Singleton) leaves him, the volume in his life goes haywire.

""Caesar and Me"" (Season Five, Episode #28) - Broke and jobless, ventriloquist Jonathan West (Jackie Cooper) is no match for his evil dummy, Little Caesar.",1287014400,,1198,5.2356020942408374
290412,4,6300270068,"Four more great episodes from Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE.  This volume includes the legendary, much-lampooned ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", which stars William Shatner as a former mental patient who is now convinced that a gremlin is tampering with the wing of a plane that he is traveling on.  Creepy stuff...the gremlin was played by Burt Lancaster's former circus partner Nick Cravat.  This disc also includes ""Time Enough At Last"", a real tour-de-force for Burgess Meredith, who dons coke-bottle glasses to play a man obsessed with books but lacking the time in which to read them...until one fateful day.

Episodes:

""Time Enough At Last"" (Season One, Episode #8) - Bookworm Henry Bemis (Burgess Meredith) yearns for more time to read - then a nuclear holocaust leaves him alone in the world with lots of time, plenty to read, and one ironic twist!

""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" (Season One, Episode #22) - Inexplicable events cause the residents of quiet Maple Street to erupt into rioting.  The residents suspect an alien invasion has occurred.  If so, where are the alien monsters?

""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" (Season Five, Episode #3) - Salesman Bob Wilson (William Shatner), recovering from a nervous breakdown spots a gremlin on the wing of his plane.  When he attempts to alert his wife Julia (Christine White) and the others, his nightmare truly begins!

290413,4,6300270068,"Three more creepy classics from Rod Serling and THE TWILIGHT ZONE!  Of the three episodes featured on this volume, my favourite by far is ""Queen of the Nile"", mainly because it is put together with such style and elegance.  Ann Blyth looks like a million bucks, and the entire premise of the story is so fascinating.  Coming a close second is, of course, ""Mute"", one of TWILIGHT ZONE's Season Four double-length stories; starring a young Ann Jillian in the lead.

Episodes:

""The Whole Truth"" (Season Two, Episode #14) - A peculiar Model A automobile compels a used car dealer, Harvey Hunnicut (Jack Carson) to tell only the truth.  Consequently, he can't sell a single vehicle on his lot...until he comes up with an unusual marketing idea.

""Mute"" (Season Four, Episode #5) - Twelve-year-old Ilse Nielsen (Ann Jillian), who has lost her parents in a fire, doesn't speak because she has been raised in a telepathic community.  Taken in by Cora and Harry Wheeler (Barbara Baxley and Frank Overton), the surrogate parents soon become consumed by the task of ""adapting"" Ilse to her new surroundings...no matter what the price.

""Queen of the Nile"" (Season Five, Episode #23) - When journalist Jordan Herrick (Lee Philips) interviews former Hollywood glamour girl Pamela Morris (Ann Blyth), he also slowly uncovers the disturbing truth behind her bewitching beauty.

290414,4,6300270068,"Each reviewer for this specific volumn of TZ episodes seems to have his or her own favorite. I'll add my thoughts if nobody minds, because one of the included episodes has always been, in my opinion, very underrated when it should be up there with Shatner and his Nightmare or Burgess Meredith and Time Enough at last to read, if only all the Lenscrafters hadn't been destroyed by that damned nuclear wipeout. Firstly, my least favorite: ""Still Valley"". I didn't get it twenty years ago, and I still don't get it. Gary Merrill finds himself in a town frozen stock still, is offered a book that will help his side win the Civil War, decides he doesn't want it if it means he'll be making a deal with the Devil...the end. I really, really try to see good to this specific episode, and I just don't, so I'll leave it alone. ""I Shot An Arrow"" is good, and I've watched it many times. Dewey Martin, without repeating too much or giving up too much of the plot not mentioned by other reviewers, ends up the surviving astronaut who gets the kick in the teeth of all kicks by Fate. Good acting, well-written, and I like the TZ-type twist. Now, ""Death Ship"": I absolutely love this episode, one of the hour ones when TZ went to that length for one season. Jack Klugman, Ross Martin and Frederick Beir are astronauts, and when their ship lands on another planet, they're more than surprised to see an exact replica of it already there, right down to doubles of themselves in the phantom ship's hold. Again, the plot is mentioned in other reviews, but the basic question to the first time viewer - or even those going back with an ""I guess you could look at it this way, too"" attitude - is, Are these three men dead, and did their ship crash? This means that they're ghosts, for lack of a better description...maybe. Klugman's character, a hardnosed, unwilling-to-give-an-inch Captain, refuses to believe that theory, and he thinks that they have gone through some sort of warp and are witnessing their future. Therefore, he says, they just won't land in the first place, and there won't be any crash landing. Hm, oohhkaay. While the two men under Ross mull this over, Beir's character, Carter, rubs his eyes in confusion, and suddenly finds himself walking home. He meets a neighbor and then reaches his house, which is empty of life. On the bed in the master bedroom, though, he finds a telegram informing his wife that her husband - Carter - has been killed, and with the telegram are black gloves and hat, i.e. widow's weeds. Captain Ross talking to him jolts Carter back to what we assume is reality, and Carter relates the experience, uncertain of what, in fact, is happening to him. Meanwhile, Ross Martin's character, Ted Mason, has lain down for a nap and - disappeared. He is now at a picnic site, and from the brush runs his little girl. Simply by the look on Ross Martin's face, and how he, in character, holds the child, shatters into a thousand pieces with gratitude, grief, confusion much like Carter's, the viewer knows that the child has died. Therefore, that makes Mason dead as well, right? Not so fast. As Mason finds his wife, also dead (we learn very shortly that they were killed in a car wreck), and Mason embraces her with as much joy as he did his daughter, hm, here comes Captain Ross, determined to shove his ideas down Mason's throat. Ross literally tries to drag Mason back 'with him', and the two struggle, but in the end, both are back on the ship and Mason is devastated. He cries out that it was real, and Captain Ross snaps No way, we're going to go over this again, and now he's got new theories, none of which have to do with the astronauts all being deader than doornails. The ship goes back up on Captain Ross' orders, lands again (why they land again, after all, is explained by Captain Ross), and as the other two men beg for release, Captain Ross says, No, we are going to go over this again.... - Now, why I think it's a great episode. Firstly, the acting is superb: Klugman is amazing, and Ross Martin, as the one left behind when his family was wiped out, is magnificent. His facial reactions, the tone in his voice, whether when talking to his dead child or begging his captain to please let him be what he is, now - dead - is remarkable. I have always loved both Klugman and Martin, and this episode shows just why I think that they are/were actors who never were fully appreciated. The other reason I like it: Maybe I have taken too many psychology classes, but I see this offering as a commentary on man being afraid of the greatest unknown, Death, and willing to do anything to keep it at bay just awhile longer. Even if that means having to drag something out, repeat the same useless motions again and again,there are far more people worried about suddenly not being than there are those who believe Death will be a different road, same trip. If none of this is what you think after watching the episode, that's fine - as I said at the beginning, the viewer is left to make their own decision. Whether ghosts, hypnotized by aliens, whatever, these are three lost souls, and that's what makes it scary. There isn't one of us that hasn't lain awake at night at least once and thought, ""Nah, there's no way I can die, that happens to somebody else. Let's go over my options again."" Creepy, deep and worth watching -",1286323200,2,5353,4.50256937307297
290415,4,6300270068,"Four of the best episodes from THE TWILIGHT ZONE, including two of my all-time personal favourites, ""The After Hours"" and ""Living Doll"".

In ""The After Hours"", ""Forbidden Planet""'s Anne Francis plays Marsha, a confused young woman shopping for a specific gold thimble in a large department store.  After encountering a spooky saleslady (Elizabeth Allen), Marsha gets into an argument with the management and falls asleep in the back office...when she awakens the store is closed (evidently she was forgotten about by the bumbling staff) but the MANNEQUINS are very vocal indeed, with their eerie chants of ""Marsha...Marsha...""

This episode is the reason why I'm scared of anything that resembles a mannequin...seriously!  There have been countless episodes of sitcoms where characters accidentally get locked in stores but ""The After Hours"" is the mother of them all!  Anne Francis is absolutely luminous.

""Living Doll"" casts Telly Savalas as Erich Streator, a hateful, downright nasty man who severely resents his stepdaughter Christie (Tracy Stratford) and the time she seemingly takes away from his new wife Annabelle (Mary La Roche).  So you can imagine Erich's reaction when the happy twosome return from a shopping trip with a fancy new doll...

Talky Tina, as the doll is called, isn't as sugary sweet as she seems.  When Christie and her mother aren't around, Tina gets into the habit of taunting Erich with smart little phrases like ""I'm going to kill you"" and ""You'll be sorry..."".  Seems that Tina knows exactly how to push Erich's buttons...and he'd better watch out when Tina's threats become more extreme!  Tina's voice was provided by animation legend June Foray, best-remembered for Rocky of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" fame.

The other two episodes spotlighted on this disc are ""The Dummy"" (with Cliff Robertson), which is a lot like ""Living Doll""; and ""The Fever"", one of the more disturbing episodes, which follows a middle-aged couple on holiday in Las Vegas and a particular poker machine's hypnotic spell...",1282694400,,2026,5.238390092879257
290416,5,6300270068,"I remembered this episode from when I was a kid. Facinating story of a man who thinks gambling is ""an abomanation"" and...he ends up addicted to the slot machine. I am a recovering compulsive gambler and know all too well the horrors of compulsive gambling. This story is campy, yet amazing that way back in the early 60's people were getting addicted to the play. Today's slot machines, especially video poker, are designed to draw us in. Women in particular are prone to addiction to video poker machines - known as the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling.",1271980800,,549,4.729166666666667
290417,4,6300270068,"One great episode, one medium episode, and the other the worst of the worst.

This disc contains three stories, JESS BELLE, SOUNDS AND SILENCES, and CAESAR AND ME. JESS BELLE is one hour long. First, the good news. CAESAR AND ME is a charming story and a work of art. CAESAR AND ME concerns an out-of-work ventriloquist played by famed actor, Jackie Cooper. The story also involves a girl of about ten years of age, who lives in the same building as Jackie Cooper, and who is curious about Jackie Cooper and his dummy, and who listens at the door to his little apartment. There is not one misplaced moment in the story. CAESAR AND ME is excellent from beginning to end, and it has a unique surprise ending.

CAESAR AND ME is actually a variation of another TWILIGHT ZONE episode, called THE DUMMY. THE DUMMY begins with this opening narrative, ""You're watching a ventriloquist named Jerry Etherson, a voice-thrower par excellence. His alter ego, sitting atop his lap, is a brash stick of kindling with the sobriquet 'Willie'. In a moment, Mr. Etherson and his knotty-pine partner will be booked in one of the out-of-the-way bistros - that small, dark, intimate place known as the Twilight Zone."" The main difference between CAESAR AND ME and THE DUMMY, is as follows. In CAESAR AND ME, there is a transition where the dummy leaves Jackie Cooper and befriends the girl. But in THE DUMMY, there is a transition where the dummy takes over the nightclub show, and becomes the boss of the ventriloquist. FIVE STARS to CAESAR AND ME.

Jackie Cooper acted in the series of shorts, OUR GANG, a.k.a., THE LITTLE RASCALS. Then he acted in movies such as Skippy (1931), The Champ (1931), The Bowery (1933), The Choices of Andy Purcell (1933), Treasure Island (1934), and O'Shaughnessy's Boy (1935). As an older adult, during the 1970s, he played editor Perry White in the Superman movies which featured Christopher Reeve. During the 1960s, he worked behind the scenes in Hollywood, casting TV shows and directing. For example, he directed the TV series MASH. Regarding OUR GANG, OUR GANG made its all-talking debut in April 1929 with the 25 minute Small Talk. In the ensuing year, they lost Joe, Jean and Harry, and added Norman ""Chubby"" Chaney, Dorothy DeBorba, Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard, Donald Haines and Jackie Cooper. Jackie proved to be the personality the series had been missing since Mickey left, and he was featured prominently in three 1930/1931 Our Gang films: Teacher's Pet, School's Out, and Love Business (source: Wikipedia).

JESS BELLE is about a farmer torn between two women, a blonde and a brunette. The story appears to take place in the mountains of Kentucky or perhaps Tennessee, and the story includes fiddles, barn-dances, and phony hillbilly accents. The man chooses to marry the blonde, and the brunette seeks the guidance of a ""witch."" The witch provides the brunette with a potion, and the result of the brunette drinking the potion is that the man abandons the blonde, and instead chooses the brunette. But the brunette has acquired the property that she turns into a leopard when the clock strikes midnight, and she must flee the man whenever the clock strikes midnight. Thus, the movie is a combination of CINDERELLA and a medieval story of witches. JESS BELLE actually shows a real leopard. The real leopard is shown sitting on the roof of hillbilly cabin. The leopard is shown sitting in the loft of a barn. The two actresses are abundantly easy on the eye. They play their parts with great conviction. But JESS BELLE lacks credibility, because people usually do not associate mountain folk of Kentucky or Tennessee with witches. Perhaps, the story should have been set in Salem, Massachusetts, or in Merry Olde England. THREE STARS.

SOUNDS AND SILENCES is truly horrid. It concerns an owner of a small business that markets model ships. The owner has a foul personality, and abuses his employees. For example, in the company's office the owner plays loud recordings of World War II ships, and he yells at his employees. Eventually, the owner develops a mental disorder, where even the tiniest sounds, e.g, clocks ticking, become unbearable to him. The owner then seeks a psychiatrist, and he recovers from his mental malady. SOUNDS AND SILENCES is actually a variation of THE MIND AND THE MATTER, featuring famed comedian Shelley Berman. (THE MIND AND THE MATTER is one of the best of the best of the Twilight Zone stories. THE MIND AND THE MATTER, as far as dramas are concerned, is a true work of art.) But, unfortunately, SOUNDS AND SILENCES is irritating from start to finish. SOUNDS AND SILENCES involves unconvincing characters. ZERO STARS.",1270425600,,4668,4.881462799495586
290454,4,6300270068,"Volume 28 of the Twilight Zone series has three stories.  THE WHOLE TRUTH features a used car salesman, where the actor resembles Telly Savalas.  Telly Savalas can be seen in LIVING DOLL, which features a talking doll who proclaims, ""My name is Talking Tina, and I'm going to kill you."" (The voice is that of June Foray, renowned as the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel.)  At any rate, the used car salesman is Jack Carson.  Mr. Carson has acted in many films(see below).  Some of America's most famous actors have been in Mr. Carson's movies, e.g., Judy Garland and Doris Day.

The story in THE WHOLE TRUTH gets its real start when an elderly man sells a very old automobile to Jack Carson.  The old automobile is ""haunted.""  It has the property of causing the owner to be truthful.  At any rate, I will not disclose any more about this excellent story.  THE WHOLE TRUTH is somewhat similar to another Twilght Zone episode, YOU DRIVE.  In YOU DRIVE, an automobile has the property of making the owner suffer from a guilty conscience.  YOU DRIVE is one of the best of all the Twilight Zone episodes.  YOU DRIVE is a work of art.  THE WHOLE TRUTH is also quite excellent, but the ending is somewhat dated, because it refers to certain politicians from the early 1960s.  THE WHOLE TRUTH will be a fun episode to watch repeatedly.

MUTE is a one-hour episode.  The storyline is about a girl in German who moves to a small town in Pennsylvania with her parents.  The girl had been trained to communicate by mental telepathy.  When people try to talk to her, all she hears is harsh electronic-sounding voices that cannot be easily be understood.  The girl never speaks, but she is good at reading minds.  The house of the German family burns down, and only the girl survives.  The girl is adopted by a childless couple, and they embark on the journey of trying to get the girl to talk.  MUTE is not a particularly attractive Twilight Zone episode.  MUTE mostly features unpleasant interactions between characters.  Most unpleasant is the teacher at the girl's school, who gets on the mute girl's case again and again. To summarize, the story has a fine premise, namely the idea of a child raised with no speech, but instead telepathy.  But the script wastes this idea, and developes it poorly.  I was glad when this episode ended.

QUEEN OF THE NILE is a horror-story about a newspaper reporter's discovery that an apparently young woman is much older than she appears.  By the end of the movie, we realize that the woman is thousands of years old.  The story involves magical Egyptian amulets.  If you like the first Indiana Jones movie, then QUEEN OF THE NILE will be to your tastes.  This story features the lovely Ann Blyth, who has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures at 6733 Hollywood Boulevard.  The story covers quite a bit of ground in just a half hour.  Every scene adds to the plot.  What economy in script-writing!

QUEEN OF THE NILE involves people who change their age right before our eyes.  This theme has been used in two other T.Z. episodes, THE LONG MORROW, and the other A SHORT DRINK FROM A CERTAIN FOUNTAIN.  But QUEEN OF THE NILE features a change in age scene that is much, much better carried than those of these two other T.Z. episodes.

290458,4,6300270068,"This collection of Twilight Zone has the pilot, a great episode, and two entertaining stories.  ""Where Is Everybody"" is a study in loneliness when a young man finds himself trapped in a town without people.  Serling's original introduction to the series is included before the episode.  This must be an early version because another narrator (not Serling) opens and closes the story.  In the other Twilight Zone shows Serling always appears in person-- even in a later version of this episode included in the ""Treasures of the Twilight Zone"". ""Eye of the Beholder"", one of Twilight Zone's best ventures, is about standards of beauty and the acceptance of people. A man believes that machines are conspiring against him in ""A Thing about Machines"". ""A World of His Own"" is a humorous tale about a playwright whose creations come to life.  This DVD has both well known classics and rare items from the Twilight Zone and will make a fine addition to the collection of those who love vintage science fiction.  Many of the volumes each contain at least one or two of my favorite Twilight Zone stories, and they cost much less than the sets of the complete seasons. The only thing that would be better than this would be choosing individual episodes for your own DVD's, but having three or four shows chosen for you on each disc with some being great and others decent is probably the next best thing.",1262736000,2,1395,4.743801652892562

290462,5,6300270068,"So far I have the first three volumes of the series. Claymore's storyline has gotten better and better with each one. After finishing the third volume a month ago, I thought it had reached the apex of its incredible plot and action. I expected pretty much the same level for volume four. I was wrong.

Vol. 4 Rumors of War blew Vol. 3 out of the water!

Without getting into too many details to prevent spoilers to followers of this series, the storyline that was getting hot is now getting to be a raging furor. More revelations come to light that leave you wondering how Clare is ever going to make it through this, as it seems impossible she will. Old familiar faces make a return that I was more than happy to see again. New faces are introduced that are extremely likable as well. Miria and Clare are favorites, but now Jean is up there too. I'm sure you all will like her too!

The voice acting continues to be nothing short of superb, especially with the increase of action that is in this volume. The stunning artwork continues to show in great detail as you watch it. I know some may be angry about it and call it blasphemy, but Claymore has surpassed Full Metal Alchemist in legendary status. The level of character development, plotline, action, emotion... it's all there!

If I haven't said it before, I will say it now: Claymore is a MUST see. You won't regret it.

With the clocks magical power everything comes to a stop whenever she yells out ""SHUT UP"".  Then once she claps her hands everything resumes as normal. It ends as the family is huddled together listening to the news on a radio of a nuclear bomb is headed to their city.  The woman can't deal with this and yells SHUT UP.

"" Static"" - 2.5/5 stars - is the story of an aged man living with older mature adults who complains about the 'present' technologies and misses the past when he stumbles upon a radio that brings him the good-ole-days: the only issue though, is he is only one that can hear it.

""Four O Clock"" - 5/5 stars - is one of those gems of TZ that is worth watching over and over. Oliver Crangle is an obsessed, self-absorbed bigot who believes all 'evil people' need to be punished and harassed. He concocts a plan to punish all the evil ones and his plan will be unveiled at 4 O'Clock (unfortunately, he 'falls short' of his plan)

""The Parrallel"" - 4/5 stars - An Astronaut returning from a failed launch returned home to a slightly different world: President Kennedy is not president, his house seems a bit different and his wife and daughter are not exactly the same. This episode was very well acted and opens the mind to parrallel universes",1234310400,2,1119,4.52970297029703

290497,4,6300270068,"TWILIGHT ZONE VOL. 40.  Vol. 40 contains three episodes, CAVENDER IS COMING, a comedy featuring Carol Burnett, PASSAGE ON THE LADY ANNE, a mild-mannered drama about a ship voyage, and BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S, an Orwellian drama that takes itself a bit too seriously.

CAVENDER IS COMING begins with a mediocre angel who is given one more chance by his supervisor to do some good for the mortals.  The angel is given one day to bring happiness to a mortal.  In this case, the mortal is an unemployed young woman who really has no job skills and is slow at learning technical skills.  At any rate, the comedic aspects of this drama feature involve ineptitudes of the angel and ineptitudes of Carol Burnett.  For example, the angel tries to make Carol Burnett happy by making the city bus, carrying both of them, change into a limousine.  However, the angel flubs up, and instead it turns into a horse and carriage.  Carol Burnett tries to learn simple hand signals during her first day on the job as an usher in a movie theater.  But she finds herself confused and treats the viewer to an array of amusing expressions found in greater quantities in only one other film, namely, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.  FIVE STARS for CAVENDER.  And hurray for Carol Burnett and her great repertoire of charming expressions.

The theme of an angel coming down to earth to help mortals is frequent in TWILIGHT ZONE.  This theme occurs in SHOWDOWN WITH RANCE MCGREW (vol. 26), where the angel of a real gunslinger teaches an actor playing the same gunslinger a lesson.  This theme also occurs in A PASSAGE FOR TRUMPET (vol. 4), where an angel convinces Jack Klugman that he has things to live for.  The theme occurs in A GAME OF POOL (vol. 3), where an angel (Jonathan Winters) returns to earth to play a game of pool with Jack Klugman, only to lose the game.  Also, the theme occurs in A NICE PLACE TO VISIT (vol. 29), where a petty thief is escorted to heaven by an angel (Sebastian Cabot).  The thief finds the heaven to be quite heavenly, but instead it is hell.  This story takes the same twist as Jean Paul Sartre's NO EXIT.  Most charming of all is ONE FOR THE ANGELS (Vol. 14) where Ed Wynn plays a salesman who sacrifices himself to save the life of a little girl by playing a clever trick on an angel who's original job was to escort Ed Wynn to the promised land.  The Twilight Zone episode closest to CAVENDER is MISTER BEVIS (vol. 39).  MISTER BEVIS features a Pee-Wee Herman character who is unable to keep a job, not because he is unskilled, but because he goofs off too much.  The Pee-Wee Herman character is visited by an angel.  The angel proudly educates Mr. Bevis about Mr. Bevis' successful and accomplished ancestors but, is unable to convince Mr. Bevis to get serious about any career.

PASSAGE ON THE LADY ANNE is a typical Twilight Zone episode.  The hour passes by pleasantly enough.  There is a surprise ending.  Much better shipboard stories in the Twilight Zone series are JUDGEMENT NIGHT (vol. 13) and THIRTY FATHOM GRAVE (vol. 20).  THREE STARS for PASSAGE.

BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S, which stars Richard Deacon, is an Orwellian story much like THE OBSOLETE MAN (vol. 13), starring Burgess Meredith.  In BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S, Richard Deacon is busy automating his manufacturing plant, installing computers.  We are all familiar with electronic card readers for unlocking doors at work.  In this Twilight Zone episode from 1964, we are treated to a light-activated card reader for opening a door.  The story focuses on arguments and complaints between Richard Deacon and a former elderly supervisor of the plant, regarding the ethics of firing workers and replacing them with computers.  Richard Deacon is a fascinating actor and, in his hands, his character is believable and always of interest.

In case you were expecting a bunch of humorous twists to this story, forget it.  The plot is not a comedy, but a tirade against automation.  BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S does have a humorous surprise ending.  The story might be fun to watch more than once. But BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S is not quite in the eternally-charming league of certain other as T.Z. episodes, such as, CAVENDER IS COMING, ONE FOR THE ANGELS, TIME ENOUGH AT LAST, NICK OF TIME, KICK THE CAN, STEEL, A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, or MISTER BEVIS.  THREE STARS for BRAIN CENTER.",1226966400,,4360,4.7093791281373845

290556,2,6300270068,"Volume 35 contains three stories, STATIC, FOUR O'CLOCK, and THE PARALLEL. STATIC was filmed with a videocamera, not with photographic film. Thus the image quality is slightly impaired. STATIC is excellent.  FOUR 0'CLOCK (at least in my opinion) is irritating, since its disclosure of a mean-spirited man is too close to reality.  THE PARALLEL, at least in my opinion, could have been better developed.

STATIC takes place in a rooming house, with various elderly people. Most of them like watching T.V. We are shown some of the T.V. shows, including an amusing commercial for chlorophyll cigarettes. But one of the roomers, an old man, prefers to listen to his large floor-standing vacuum tube radio.  The old radio provides
Tommy Dorsey music broadcasts, and news broadcasts, including one with Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking.  One of the boarders is the man's former fiancee, with whom he'd once been in love.  From the outset, the other boarders in the rooming house think that the old man is crazy.  When the old man beckons them to come upstairs to hear the radio, all they hear is static.  Eventually, the other boarders have the old radio toted away by a junk dealer, but the old man recovers it and pays $10 for it.  Back in his room, he continues to listen to old Tommy Dorsey programs (which are in fact, solely in his imagination).  The story is concluded when the old woman (the former fiancee) comes into the room  --  she is a couple of decades younger  --  and the old man has his hair back and is also a couple of decades younger --  and they embrace.  In other words, the conclusion discloses that the old man has gone further off the deep end.  This is a solid feel-good type of story.  It is not quite the masterpiece of another Twilight Zone story about old folks in a rest home (KICK THE CAN).  FIVE STARS for STATIC.

FOUR O'CLOCK concerns a red-baiter and trouble-maker who likes to make anonymous telephone calls, with the goal of ruining the careers of other people. Theodore Bikel's characterization of the trouble-maker is excellent. The character wears extremely thick glasses, and has odd mannerisms. An excellent addition to the stage set is a parrot. The parrot adds local color. But that is about all there is to the story--we are shown repeated telephone calls to employers, where the trouble-maker tries to ruin another man's career. The storyline is unpleasant. This Twilight Zone episode just discloses a typical example of one person's ambitious goal of pestering a man's family.

During the last five minutes of FOUR O'CLOCK, the trouble-maker decides that he will make all of his victims undergo a change in size, to make them 2 feet tall. He just decides this on his own. The story fails to disclose how he will make his victims 2 feet tall. At any rate, the story ends when Theodore Bikel turns 2 feet tall. The Theodore Bikel character is irritating to watch, since the character is truly a nut case, lacking any humanity or quirky charm. ONE STAR.

THE PARALLEL shows an astronaut going up in space. There are excellent shots of the rocket ship going up. Once in space, the astronaut sees a bright light, and then he lands safely. As it turns out, he is on a ""parallel world,"" and his family perceives him to be a different man (though the story never discloses what it is that makes him appear different). Also, the astronaut perceives some changes, for example, a wooden fence has materialized in his front yard. NASA puts the astronaut under observation. The hour drags by extremely slowly. Eventually, we see the man in the space capsule again, and there is another bright light. When the man lands back on earth, everything is back to normal again. But there is a twist. NASA personnel find evidence that there really was a parallel world (This is a bit like the ending in Jodie Foster's CONTACT). The evidence is that the space capsule was manufactured in a slightly different way, though the story does not disclose how. The script really is like a rough draft. The plot is under-developed. ONE STAR.

The same story was more fully developed in the full-length color feature JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN, with actor Roy Thinnes. The reviews of this color movie have been generally very good.  JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN has too much yelling and arguing and, at least in my opinion, I found that it did not make for good sci-fi entertainment.

For those just starting their Twilight Zone collection, I might recommend volume 2 (Time Enough at Last; Nightmare at 20,000 Feet), volume 3 (Kick the Can; Steel), volume 8 (To Serve Man), volume 9 (Nick of Time), volume 32 (Printer's Devil), volume 29 (Penny for Your Thoughts), and volume 39 (Mister Bevis; The Silence).",1202428800,3,4733,4.721749696233293
290557,4,6300270068,"Volume 22 contains four stories.

A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE features a handsome businessman, by the name of Arthur Curtis.  He engages in business-like banter with his business-like secretary.  He says things like, ""Are the Manson contracts ready yet.""  He refers to his upcoming vacation with his wife, ""It's the first vacation that Maryanne and I have had in years . . .""

But while dialing his office phone, the man is suddenly confronted with the fact that one wall of his office has been replaced with accoutrements of a movie set--movie camera, director, stage hands.  The businessman retreats to his secretary's office, but she's changed.  ""Where ya goin'?"" she asks, her feet propped on top of her desk.  The businessman is confused, and exclaims, ""I don't know you!  I don't know any of you!""  At this point, the music features violins playing theremin-like sounds, accompanied by scary deep-throated bassoon sounds.  Early in the story, we learn that ""Arthur Curtis"" is merely a character in the script of the T.V. show being filmed.

A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE contains plenty of eye-candy for automobile enthusiasts.  We see early model Ford Thunderbirds, Chryslers with big fins, a Corvette Sting Ray, a Studebaker, etc.  Pure eye-candy.

The plot of A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE is basically the same, but not quite as good, as that in PERSONS OR PERSONS UNKNOWN (vol. 32). FOUR STARS.

BACK THERE is a history time-travel story, just like those in the 1960s television series, TIME TUNNEL.  In BACK THERE, the protagonist goes back in time to the evening of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.  BACK THERE starts out in an exclusive men's club, called The Potomac Club.

The opening words are as follows.  One man says, ""What's your point?""  Another man replies, ""That if it were possible to go back in time, there'd be nothing in the world to prevent you from altering the course of history.""

The main character, actor Russell Johnson, leaves the club, but as soon as he shuts the door, has a dizzy spell and finds himself at the same location, but about 100 years earlier, on the eve of Lincoln's assassination in the year 1865.  Russell Johnson tries to warn the townspeople of what will happen.  He even encounters John Wilkes Booth, and tries to warn him.  Eventually, Russell Johnson returns to the present time.  He finds some differences, but not the differences he was hoping for.  For example, the man originally the butler in The Potomac Club has turned into one of the business executives (one of the members of the club).  BACK THERE has an excellent ironic ending.  FIVE STARS.

ONE MORE PALLBEARER deals with nuclear war. The main character wants to get even with three people who were mean to him when he was a younger.  For example, he wants to get even with a high school teacher.  The plot in ONE MORE PALLBEARER is forced, things don't really click well, and it is hard to have any feelings (e.g., sympathy, dislike) of any kind for the main character.  TWO STARS.

RING-A-DING GIRL is a typical, average Twilight Zone episode.  The story begins at a resort, where an actress is on the phone, arranging a jet plane trip to Rome.  A violin makes a scary theremin-sound, as the actress looks at her ring.  In looking at her ring, a face materializes.  It is the actress' sister.  The sister begs the actress to come home.  In the next scene, at the sister's home, the actress and the sister have a joyous reunion, and talk merrily about life in general.  They comment about the forecast for a storm.  There is discussion about the town picnic, set for later on in the day.

The actress looks again at her ring, and another face materializes and asks her to come home (actually, at this point, she is already at home).  The actress faints, and when she revives, she looks in the ring once more, and the school janitor materializes in the ring and begs her, ""Help us, help us.""  Much of the story is spent discussing whether the actress will go to the town picnic, or if she will give a 1-person show in the school auditorium.  Eventually, the storm arrives.  The story has a nice ironic ending.  (The story could have been written to be more convincing or more forceful.  I would recommend, for example, increasing images of the jet plane approaching storm clouds.  This would result in a better build-up, in a better conveyance of feelings of impending doom.)  THREE STARS.

Overall, volume 22 is a very good disc.  But there are better volumes of the Twilight Zone.  I recommend volume 2 (Time Enough at Last; Nightmare at 20,000 Feet), volume 3 (Kick the Can; Steel), volume 8 (To Serve Man), volume 9 (Nick of Time), volume 32 (Printer's Devil), volume 29 (Penny for Your Thoughts), and volume 39 (Mister Bevis; The Silence).

Art Carney plays Henry Corwin, a drunken department store santa whose heart is broken over poverty stricken children and elderly at Christmas time. Henry comes across a sack which allows him the opportunity to be santa, not only for the night but for all time as you will see at the end.

This is a charming story and Mr. Carney did an excellent job in portraying Henry.

I won't give away any more of the movie so as not to ruin it for anyone but this is a true Christmas classic and I'm surprised that someone hasn't tried to breathe life into this forgotten masterpiece. It is now a part of my Christmas movie collection and has already been watched numerous times this holiday season.",1165881600,4,817,4.469798657718121
290638,4,6300270068,"This 18th Volume of THE TWILIGHT ZONE doesn't include any must see episodes.  The second episode featured on the disc is worth the money because of an excellent performance by Jack Klugman and the third episode revolves around an intriguing Civil War-based story.  The three episodes on the disc are:

""I Shot an Arrow Into the Air""--the first manned space mission ends up crashing on an unchartered asteroid, killing all but three of the crew.  The three astronauts find the environment harsh and hot with only five gallons of water to spare among them.  Established rules and norms soon come crashing down as the remains of the crew find themselves in setting that quickly becomes just like THE LORD OF THE FLIES.  Out of the three episodes on the disc, this was my 2nd favorite.  The equipment and costumes date this episode greatly and the premise of the story is quite farfetched, especially since we've now been to space.  However, at the time of the episode's initial airing, Sputnik was only two-and-a-half-years-old and the Space Race hadn't really started.

""Death Ship""--three astronauts scouting for hospitable planets for harvesting and possible colonization come across a crashed space craft almost identical to their own.  Inside, they discover duplicate bodies of themselves and try to figure out the difference between what has already happened and what is happening.  Jack Klugman stars as the willful and determined Captain Ross.  Despite the strong performance of Klugman, this was my least favorite of the episodes on this disc.

""Still Valley""--a Confederate scout enters a town where an entire Union company stands as still as statues.  The valley's lone waking occupant reveals what has happened to the scout, promising him that the Confederacy can win the war if they just follow his plan.  But to do so requires enlisting an ally of wayward means.  This short, but intriguing story is my favorite episode on the disc.

The only extras featured on this DVD are a collection of written features entitled ""Inside the Twilight Zone"".  Some of the information here is both interesting and informative for fans of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, but most others will find it completely trivial.",1157068800,,2201,5.049861495844875

290640,5,6300270068,"It is rather surprising to realize that there was only one Christmas episode during the five year run of ""The Twilight Zone.""  When Rod Serling's celebrated television anthology series was on the air it was not unusual to have new episodes airing the week before Christmas (we were lucky to have reruns of last year's Christmaukkah episode of ""The O.C."" this week).  But only during the second season of the show (episode #47 if you are keeping count) that we got to enjoy ""The Twilight Zone Christmas: Night of the Meek"" (which even ended with Serling saying ""and a Merry Christmas to one and all,"" which was cut for subsequent non-holiday airings).

""Night of the Meek,"" written by Rod Serling, finds poor Henry Corwin (Art Carney), a department store Santa who shows up drunk on Christmas Eve and is fired. Wandering the streets, he discovers a magic bag that can dispense any gift he asks for.  The question is, what will Henry do with this most unusual bag?  Directed by Jack Smight, this episode originally aired on December 23, 1960.  If you are a fan of the ""Zone"" then you have probably heard the legend that Serling wrote the episode just to see Art Carney play Santa Claus.  The excellent support casts features two of the best character actors of all time with John Fielder as Henry's short-tempered boss and Burt Mustin as a friendly bum on the streets, but this is Art Carney's triumph.

The episode was one of six shot during the second season on videotape instead of film, but that is a minor complaint because it just makes ""Night of the Meek"" seem like a live television broadcast from the 1950s.  However, since this was a special season episode of the ""Zone"" written by Serling, we will give his closing narration the final word: ""A word to the wise to all the children of the twentieth century, whether their concern be pediatrics or geriatrics, whether they crawl on hands and knees and wear diapers or walk with a cane and comb their beards. There's a wondrous magic to Christmas, and there's a special power reserved for little people. In short, there's nothing mightier than the meek.""",1135382400,3,2110,4.696476964769648
290641,5,6300270068,"First seen during THE TWILIGHT ZONE's initial season, ""Judgment Night"" has everything:  a script with a profound moral, uncanny direction (by John Brahm, director of some of the series' finest episodes) and photography, a bravura performance by Nehemiah Persoff, a moody musical score.  And like so many of Rod Serling's most memorable episodes (""Walking Distance"" and ""A Stop at Willoughby"" among them), ""Judgment Night"" seems to have been influenced by the author's own life - in this case, by his combat experiences in WWII and the trauma, complete with vivid and recurring nightmares, he suffered for the rest of his days.

If a TWILIGHT ZONE fan were asked to name the most famous of the series' titles, surely ""To Serve Man"" would be on the list.  Like many more of Serling's most memorable episodes (""Time Enough at Last"" and ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" among them), this one clearly reflects the anxieties of its era:  specifically Cold War tensions and curiosity about mixed with fear of outer space.  The stunning conclusion of ""To Serve Man"" is one of the most unforgettable examples in ZONE history of a ""twist"" ending; the episode's premise and conclusion, in fact, more than compensate for its lack of a strong, central performance such as Persoff gives in ""Judgment Night.""",1122336000,,1299,4.9907407407407405

290683,4,6300270068,"Volume 43 in the series of TWILIGHT ZONE DVDs presents two classic episodes and two relative rarities from the series.  The first classic is the pilot episode, ""Where Is Everybody?""  This thirty-minute near-monodrama stars Earl Holliman as a man who inexplicably finds himself in a deserted town.  Who the man is and how he came to be in the town appropriately remains a mystery until the episode's final scene.  ""The Eye of the Beholder,"" a classic from the ZONE's second season, was quite controversial when first shown.  It is the story of a woman, Janet Tyler, who was born with a ""deformed"" face and is undergoing plastic surgery to make her face look ""normal.""  The episode takes place in a dimly lit hospital, and Janet's face, as well as the faces of the doctors and nurses attending her, is not seen until the episode's last moments - which are some of the most shocking and thrilling in ZONE history.

Both of the classic episodes were written by Rod Serling, as was ""A Thing about Machines,"" a timely (if somewhat silly) story about a man (Richard Hayden) who comes to a bad end due to his fear of technology.  Richard Matheson's ""A World of His Own,"" one of the ZONE's few comedies, is a delightful gem starring Keenan Wynn as Gregory West, a mild-mannered playwright who brings his characters to life by describing them into a Dictaphone.  In the end, the playwright is granted well-deserved happiness with one of his creations.

The reason I give this generally fine disc four stars only is this:  I feel that the presentation of ""Where Is Everybody?"" is marred by its introductory and ending narrations, which are given by an announcer who is not Serling.  Every ZONE fan knows and loves Serling's spoken narrations for the episodes:  his famous opening ones (""There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man...""; ""You're traveling through another dimension...""; ""You unlock this door with the key of imagination..."") and his creative closing ones (""Where Is Everybody""'s begins, ""Up there, up there in the vastness of space"").  The narrations are not the same without Serling's voice - its sound and its memorable, clipped delivery.  There were, in fact, two versions of ""Where Is Everybody?""  It is the first version, which was shown only to the series' prospective sponsors, that is presented here.  The man who read the narrations originally was...well, just not Serling.  This version also has dialogue in the first scene that was edited for the better-known second version - the one seen by the general viewing public.  It is debatable which version of the script is better.  But if you want to hear Serling speak his own narrations, I would suggest buying - or at least viewing - the second version of the pilot, available on the DVD ""Treasures from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.""",1121644800,20,2805,4.828451882845188
290684,4,6300270068,"""The Twilight Zone"" was always my favorite TV show.  In its' 30 minute time slot were some of the best drama, spine-tingling suspense, and morality plays ever seen on television.  It is always exciting to find an episode or two that I missed in my youth and there are some in ""Collection Three"".  However, I came away with a sense that this collection is a bit weighted down with many lesser episodes.  There's no need to list all those although the one hour episode ""He's Alive"" is about as good an example as any of what I refer to as ""lesser"".  First of all, this selection was stretched too far for the hour-long format.  Secondly, the ending was no surprize to most people.  Thirdly, the efforts at irony fell far too short of the mark.  The one redeeming feature was Rod Serling's closing comments.  I hate to say it (since it sounds sacrilegious) but I was actually bored during ""He's Alive"".

Now to the good stuff; ""A Most Unusual Camera"" is a memorable look at how greed can ruin even a ""sure thing"".  ""Elegy"" reminds our space program to know where you're going.  ""Mirror Image"" explores the possibility of meeting your double.  ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"" stars Ed Wynn as a man who thinks he knows his fate and prepares to meet it.  ""A World of Difference"" asks what we would do if we suddenly discovered everything around us was merely part of a script.  ""Ring a Ding Girl"" tells us you CAN go home again (and just in time)!  ""From Agnes With Love"" stars Wally Cox and shows us how true love finds him.

My favorite two episodes in the collections are ""The Thirty Fathom Grave"" and ""Night Call"".  ""The Thirty Fathom Grave"" is an hour-long episode that fills the whole time with an intriguing mystery that gave me goose bumps at the end even though I had seen it years before and knew how it would end.  I experienced the same goose bumps watching ""Night Call"" about an elderly invalid who starts getting mysterious phone calls one dark and stormy night.  Those two episodes and the others mentioned gave me a lot of entertainment.  However, I think that the folks that put out these collections could have done a better balancing act.  I kept thinking that I'd seen about all of the best episodes after the first two collections.  Collection Three made me wonder if I wasn't right.  Oh well, time to take a peak at ""The Twilight Zone-Collection Four"".",1119744000,3,2371,4.563981042654029
290685,1,6300270068,"First and foremost, these all have great ideas (the Shoes and Walter Jameson, at least), but all are horribly done. Bad dialogue, (which is one of the main reasons I watch TZ) saturates everything, not to mention the shifty acting.

Long Live Walter Jameson is the reason I bought this DVD. Being a huge fan of TZ and owning several DVD's I must say this is the weakest set of episodes I have seen yet.

Long Live Walter Jameson was much worse than I remember it being after seeing it on tv. Sure, the idea is brilliant, but the dialogue is weak, and quite simply, again, bad acting.

Ok, so Walter Jameson is the best on the DVD and I would give it a 2 1/2. The Shoes, a 2 the other two, -1's...

290687,5,6300270068,"This collection of ""`The Twilight Zone' Collector's Edition"" presents an interesting mix of episodes from the classic television anthology series created by Rod Serling.  There are two episodes from very early in the first season, which show the sort of scripts that Serling used to sell the series.  Then there are two ""Zone"" episodes that would be in the running for any fan's Top 10 list:

Episode 51, ""The Invaders"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired January 27, 1961) provides one of the classic performances by an actress on the ""Zone,"" with a tour de force performance by Agnes Moorhead, in an episode in which she never has a line of dialogue.  She plays a woman living alone in a farmhouse who finds that a miniature flying saucer has landed on her roof. The woman has to fight against the strange tiny invaders with their advanced technology. But then remember, this is ""The Twilight Zone,"" so there is going to be a twist.  If the spaceship looks familiar to science fiction fans it should, because it is the same one from ""Forbidden Planet.""  Notice in the prologue that this is a rare episode where Serling appears in the same frame with the actors in the story.

Episode 2, ""One for the Angels"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired October 9, 1959) was written specifically for Ed Wynn.  The great comedian plays Lew Bookman, a sidewalk pitchman who learns from Mr. Death (Murray Hamilton), that he will die at midnight.  Bookman refuses to go, so Death says he will take a little girl instead.  So Bookman convinces Death to not take him until he completes the Big Pitch, a masterpiece of salesmanship that would be ""one of the angels.""  Wynn had proven himself a dramatic actor in Serling's famous television play ""Requiem for a Heavyweight,"" and here he gets the opportunity to do both comedy and drama.

Episode 42, ""The Eye of the Beholder"" (Written by Serling, First aired November 11, 1960), is one of the quintessential ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.  The story is about Janet Tyler, a woman whose hideously deformed face has made her an outcast all of her life. Now she faces her eleventh and final operation in a last chance to look ""normal."" Maxine Stuart plays Janet under the bandages, and Donna Douglas plays her as revealed. This is one of the show's finest episodes because even when you know the twist the set up and payoff still work.  Of course, you cannot watch it without wondering what ever happened to Donna Douglas.  Apparently the original title for the episode was ""The Private World of Darkness.""

Episode 7, ""The Lonely"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired November 13, 1959) has Jack Warden as Jams A. Corry, a convicted murderer sentenced to fifty years on an asteroid in this story by Rod Serling. Captain Allenby (John Dehner) of the supply ship that stops by leaves him a present: an android named Alicia (Jean Marsh). But when Corry is pardoned, he is told he must leave the ""woman"" he loves behind and he does not if he can do that.  Look for Ted Knight as young Adams in this average ""Zone"" episode that helps define what the series was all about, because the human element mattered as much as the famous twists.",1116892800,4,3165,4.704710144927536
290688,5,6300270068,"This video features two imperishable TWILIGHT ZONE episodes dealing overtly with totalitarianism, oppression, and freedom.

The wonderful Burgess Meredith is back, giving an endearing and startlingly real performance as the ""obsolete"" librarian. And Joseph Schildkraut (from THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK) is eloquent as the ghost of a Nazi prisoner. These important episodes are essential to any ZONE collection.",1115856000,2,511,5.64935064935065
290689,5,6300270068,"""Perchance to Dream,"" written by Charles Beaumont for THE TWILIGHT ZONE's first season, has everything:  a subtle and sensitive script with a protagonist who invites sympathy, a brilliant central performance by Richard Conte, taut direction by Robert Florey, and an apt and memorable score by Van Cleave.  ""Shadow Play,"" written for the series' second season and starring Dennis Weaver, is excellent, too.  Clearly Beaumont, whose ZONE scripts were a bit darker and more unsettling than those of the series' creator, Rod Serling, was fascinated by dream-within-a-dream stories; he certainly did them up well.  Another of Beaumont's finest episodes, which I would also recommend, is ""Long Live Walter Jameson""; this one is available exclusively on DVD.",1115683200,2,751,5.504347826086956

290722,4,6300270068,"Both episodes on this video deal in the realm of the uncanny:  for example, when an inanimate object seems to move, talk, have life.  ""The Dummy,"" made in 1962, is one of the all-time classic episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  It is about an alcoholic ventriloquist named Jerry Etherson who believes that his dummy, ""Willie,"" is alive and smarter and more talented than he is.  Threatened with the possible loss of his job at a nightclub because of his instability (though he only drinks to forget Willie), Jerry tries to substitute another, ""normal"" dummy in Willie's place, with disastrous results.  In the end, Jerry is completely subjugated by Willie.  Cliff Robertson's portrayal of Jerry is intense and disturbing, and the episode is beautifully photographed, with a lonely nocturnal atmosphere reminiscent of another great TWILIGHT ZONE episode by Rod Serling, the 1960 ""A Passage for Trumpet"" starring Jack Klugman.
""The Lateness of the Hour,"" about a wealthy family that employs robot servants, is by no means as strong an episode as ""The Dummy.""  Inger Stevens, who was so memorable in the classic ""The Hitch-hiker,"" is equally fine here; the problems are the unconvincing plot and the fact that the episode was videotaped rather than filmed.  Actually, several episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE were produced in this manner.  Some of these (""The Night of the Meek,"" ""Static,"" ""Long-Distance Call"") had excellent scripts which made the mediocre picture quality irrelevant; ""The Lateness of the Hour"" has not.",1109030400,,1511,5.159836065573771

290724,5,6300270068,"THE PURPLE TESTAMENT from the First Season is a strange World War II story set in the Pacific about U.S. Army Lieutenant Fitzgerald who can predict death from a strange glow on the faces of the doomed men in his outfit. William Reynolds, a highly underrated actor, gives a brilliant performance as the lieutenant as he runs the gamut of emotions from frantic disbelief to beaten disillusionment about his terrible gift. The cast is very good including Dick York, Warren Oates, and Paul Mazursky. This is an outstanding episode. A QUALITY OF MERCY from the Third Season is another World War II story. Set in the Pacific during the final days of the war, Dean Stockwell is U.S. Army Lieutenant Katell who has absolutely no empathy or remorse for killing enemy soldiers no matter what the circumstances are.  When his situation becomes juxtaposed with the enemy Japanese he gains new insight into his convictions. The sentiments of this episode seem somewhat naive considering today's global political and militaristic posture. The nobility of combatants on contrasting sides seems a thing of the past, but this episode is written from the perspective of the ordinary man sent into the extraordinary situation of war and how he reacts to the incredibility of it. On the surface this episode could easily look like a lot of hokum but its implications run much deeper. It features another good cast including Albert Salmi and Leonard Nimoy. A QUALITY OF MERCY provides a unique look at an improbability of events and is noteworthy for what questions and emotions it presents for the viewer. THE PURPLE TESTAMENT, my favorite of the two episodes, shows us the facileness of men's souls as they become hardened to the day-to-day exposure to war and the wear and tear it takes on those placed in command to the point where the responsibility of putting men into harm's way eventually becomes frivolity.

One of the great aspects of viewing each collection, you never know which episodes will be paired. So part of the enjoyment is the 'I wonder what's next?'

This collection includes two of the sixty minute episodes. They're like a mini-movie in their quality and production. Even the thirty mintue episodes have that quality. Serling never skimped on making these high quality productions and performances. As I said about 'Collection 1,' the actors Serling used became household names, actors who saw a quality part, and knew a good opportunity when they saw it.

We're going to continue collecting these dvd's. From the packaging to the product itself, this is first rate film/television viewing. Serling deserves great credit in providing a product with such entertainment value and social significance.

One of Serling's feature films, 'Patterns' follows in the footsteps of Twilight Zone. It's not on dvd as of yet, but I highly recommend it when it is made available. It's everything TZ was and more.",1097971200,4,1145,5.042328042328043
290773,5,6300270068,"The Obsolete Man"" and ""Deaths-Head Revisited"" both deal - one in a veiled and the other in an explicit way - with oppression, Nazism, and the Holocaust.  In the first episode, Burgess Meredith plays a librarian who is ruled ""obsolete"" and condemned to die by a State that has outlawed books, free thought, and God.  This chilling episode truly makes one imagine and fear a society in which the creative individual has no place.

In ""Deaths-Head Revisited,"" a former S.S. captain named Gunther Lutze (the cold-eyed Oscar Bergei) revisits the Dachau concentration camp out of nostalgia, only to encounter Alfred Bekker (the quietly captivating Joseph Schildkraut, who had previously played Mr. Otto Frank in THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK on stage and screen), a former inmate of the camp.  Rod Serling was one of the first television writers to deal with the Holocaust, and his work here is unforgettable due to such powerful lines as Bekker's final one, and to Serling's own moving and timely closing narration, which tells us why we must ""never forget.""  The fact that the Holocaust victims are referred to not as ""Jews"" but as ""human beings"" demonstrates Serling's talent for cutting to the moral core of an issue.",1095724800,4,1209,4.935960591133005
290774,5,6300270068,"If ""A Passage for Trumpet"" is Rod Serling's version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, then ""The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine"" is his SUNSET BOULEVARD.  Like that classic's Norma Desmond, Barbara Jean Trenton is a ""movie great from another era"" who is unable to accept the fact that she is no longer in demand by Hollywood and spends her days in a darkened room with her old films.  Barbara's greatest wish is to recapture her past, with Jerry Herndon, her former, handsome leading man...and in a positively uncanny climax, her wish is granted.  Ida Lupino gives a formidable ""star performance"" as the aging actress, and Martin Balsam brings emotional depth to the role of her sympathetic agent, Danny Weiss, who tries in vain to snap her back to reality.  Mention must also be made of the set (the star's Beverly Hills mansion), which is simply beautiful.

In ""The Hitch-hiker,"" young, pretty Nan Adams (Inger Stevens), while driving cross-country, is beckoned to repeatedly by a shady looking hitch-hiker (Leonard Strong) and wanders between death and life, not certain -- until the chilling final scene -- to which she truly belongs.  This nightmarish episode is best enjoyed in the dark.",1095033600,,1179,5.02051282051282
290775,5,6300270068,"""To me, the worst fear is the fear of the unknown - the fear which you cannot share with others. That is the most nightmarish of the stimuli."" These words of Rod Serling could apply to ""The Hitch-Hiker"", one of Serling's most chilling, evocative and memorable TWILIGHT ZONE scripts. It concerns a young woman driving alone across country. She is frightened by the sight of a sinister-looking hitch-hiker who seems to appear at every turn. In a story that resembles a religious parable, she encounters a good-natured auto mechanic, a drug store owner, a heartless gas station owner, and a selfish young sailor. The episode plays with some of Serling's favorite themes: human cruelty, and the loneliness and helplessness caused by a secret anxiety. Its dark, unsettling atmosphere - especially during the terrifying night the woman goes through when her car breaks down - remain vivid in my memory.",1094947200,,896,5.02013422818792
290776,5,6300270068,"""A Passage for Trumpet"" is my favorite TWILIGHT ZONE epsiode of all. Authored by Rod Serling, it is the story of a depressed, alcoholic jazz musician who commits suicide and is given a second chance in that famed ""middle ground between science and superstition"". I am a huge fan of Jack Klugman, and ""A Passage for Trumpet"" is a prime example of this great character actor's talent. Klugman uses his expressive, ""oddly intense"" face and his inimitable way with language to draw us into the life of this sad, tormented character. His ""But when I'm drunk..."" monologue is beautifully delivered. One must also admire Klugman's excellent miming of the trumpet playing: he moves his lips and body with the swelling of the music so that one can hardly tell he is not really playing the instrument. The performances of Klugman and of John Anderson as a certain musical stranger raise this episode to the level of a masterpiece, as does its visual inventiveness: I would particularly point out the various metaphors for ""passage"", the mirror trick (where Joey fails to see his reflection), and the visual puns inherent in the ceiling lamps and in the name of the whiskey bottle in the bar (drinking and playing the trumpet are interchanged in this episode). Although it could be thought of as Serling's version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, the episode has a mood all its own, consistently gentle and poetic.

""The Four of Us Are Dying"", also written by Serling, concerns a man who can assume the face and identity of other men; his  deceptions and toying with others' emotions eventually trap him. This film noir-like episode may require a second viewing to fully absorb it (as it did for me). It is nevertheless a fine episode involving interesting themes such as the various ""faces"" we show to people. The percussive, angular musical score is by Jerry Goldsmith and perfectly complements the story. If there is anything that ties these two ZONES together - besides that they are both superb - then it must be the nocturnal, urban setting, the jazz musical scores, and the theme of ""ghosts"" returning to former haunts. This tape is a winner all around.",1094601600,3,2142,4.817934782608695
290777,5,6300270068,"My favorite TV show of all time is ""The Twilight Zone"".  There are a number of reasons for that but mostly it is because those 1/2 hour shows packed more drama, excitement, and morality lessons than anything I've seen before and since.  The star of the show was Rod Serling whose staccato-like voice opened to set the stage and wrapped up at the end with a statement of irony, intrigue, warning, or hope.  Watch the credits at the end of any episode that really impressed you and the odds are that it was written by Rod Serling.
The First Collection in this series left you wondering if it had gotten all the ""big"" episodes but ""Collection 2"" shows that there's still plenty more out there.  This collection has a couple of the later, hour-long shows that the first collection didn't have.  The first one, ""In His Image"", was one of the old episodes that stuck with me for years and I was surprized to find that it was an hour-long show.  It seemed then and now to move along at the same pace as the half-hour episodes.  The second, ""Death Ship"", however, gives a hint that the extra half hour tended to drag down the pace too much.  The rest of the episodes includes some of the great ones of the series.  There are the humorous ones such as ""Once Upon a Time "" (with Buster Keaton), ""One for the Angels"" and ""Escape Clause"".  There are the ones with happy endings such as ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim"", ""In Praise of Pip"", and ""Still Valley"".  There are the true morality plays such as ""The Fever"", ""A Quality of Mercy"", ""The Man in the Bottle"" and ""I Shot an Arrow into the Air"".  Finally, there are the down-right chilling episodes such as ""The Dummy"", ""Living Doll"", and ""The After Hours"".
I watched these episodes with my son, now 12, who seemed to enjoy them just as much as I did.  We'd only watch them at night with the lights turned out.  Sometimes we'd just look at each other afterwards and say ""Wow!"".  When there was the occassional episode that I thought might not interest him, he still talked with me about it afterwards.  They seemed to work just as well for him as for me and that may be the ultimate testimony to ""The Twilight Zone"".  With all the glitz and sparkle that TV has today, impressing a kid with a half-hour black and white show with (for him) no recognizable stars seemed too tall a task.  However, true greatest meets and exceeds the test of time.  Time now for ""Collection 3"".",1089676800,,2411,4.414027149321267
290778,4,6300270068,"Comedy rather than terror is the rule in this pair of episodes from ""The Twilight Zone,"" neither of which was written by series creator Rod Serling.  To my surprise ""Once Upon a Time"" (December 15, 1961) was written by Richard Matheson and provides a rare opportunity for outright slapstick in the Zone.  The episode features the great silent comedian Buster Keaton as janitor Woodrow Mulligan. Disgusted with the fast paced and high priced society of 1890, Woodrow steals a ""time helmet"" from the inventor who employs him, and travels to 1962. Of course, he is in for quite a bit of future shock. The 1890 sequences are down in silent fashion, with cards instead of dialogue, but the humor is trite rather than funny. Keaton is fine, but the gags are second-rate at best, which is really a surprise since the episode was directed by Norman Z. McLeod, who directed the Marx Brothers films ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Monkey Business."" This is just one of those cases were major talents come together and produce a small pop instead of a big bang.  Notice that Jesse White plays the repair man, in a bit of prescient casting.
""The Fugitive"" (March 9, 1962) stars J. Pat O'Malley as Old Ben who impresses the kids in the neighborhood when they play Martian by turning himself into a horrible looking alien.  Old Ben has a special fondness for Jenny (Susan Gordon), who lives in the same apartment building with the sour Mrs. Gann (Nancy Kulp).  Meanwhile a couple of strangers are asking questions about Old Ben.  It looks like Ben will have have to leave, but not before he does something for his young friend.  This is clearly the better episode of the pair on this videotape and one of the few ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that would qualify as a modern fairy tale.  O'Malley has fun as one of the friendlier aliens we ever encounter in the Zone.",1082332800,,1837,4.6656346749226
290779,4,6300270068,"Both of these episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" reflect one of Rod Serling's favorite themes, which is people being given a second chance.  ""The Trade-Ins"" (April 20, 1962) features veteran actors Joseph Schildkraut and Alma Platt as John and Marie Holt, who visit the New Life Corporation hoping to translate their personalities into beautiful young, artificial bodies. However, they only have enough money for ONE operation. This episode is my favorite ""Twilight Zone"" love story, made all the more effective by the performances of Schildkraut and Platt.  You would have thought that with all those other episodes to choose from they could have come up with a better second episode to pair with it on this videotape.
""Third from the Sun"" (January 8, 1960) is about the end of the world (almost).  Adapted by Serling from Richard Matheson's short story, the episode tells of scientist William Sturka (Fritz Weaver), who is convinced the world is about to end in a nuclear war. Along with test pilot Jerry Riden (Joe Maross), they escape with their families to a new planet.  This is one of those episodes that is going to be more effective for those who were not weaned on ""The Twilight Zone,"" because most of us can see the twist coming at the end of this one.  Yes, the spaceship used in this episode is the one from the classic 1956 film ""Forbidden Planet.""",1082332800,,1359,4.7905982905982905

290811,4,6300270068,"Rod Serling wrote both of these episodes of ""The Twilight Zone,"" each of which evidence the sort of O. Henry ""surprise"" endings that would become better known as ""Twilight Zone"" twists.  ""To Serve Man"" (March 2, 1962) adapted by Serling from Damon Knight's short story, is one of the most famous Zone episodes with its ""Soylent Green"" ending. A 9-foot tall Kanamit (Richard Kiel) has come to earth to create a golden age with the advanced technology of his race. However, Michael Chambers (Lloyd Bochner), a government decoding expert, learns to learn the true meaning of the title of the book left by the Kanamit. Not as much fun the second time around when the ending seems so obvious, ""To Serve Man"" teaches the old lesson that appearances can be deceiving, especially when dealing with strange visitors from another planet.
Episodes: ""Judgment Night"" (December 4, 1959) is an early first season episode set in 1942 when a German named Carl Lanser (Nehemiah Persoff) finds himself on the deck of a British steamship.  He has no idea why he is there, but he does have an overwhelming sense of doom, which gives us a pretty good clue as to who Lanser is and why he is aboard the S.S. Queen of Glasgow.  However, Persoff's performance makes up for the shortcomings of the script.  Written by Serling, this is another ""Twilight Zone"" episode where justice is delivered in a way that would have made Dante proud.  This episode has Ben Wright as Captain Wilbur, Patrick Macnee as the First Officer, and young  James Franciscus as Lieutenant Mueller.",1082160000,,1546,4.815094339622641

The performances, dialogue, writing, direction, etc. are so far beyond reproach, they not even be mentioned. However, while only being 3 Volumes into this Collection 2 (who wants to rush?), something occured to me. This isn't great because it's Sci-Fi, in fact, Sci-Fi was merely the ""hook"" that got me here. It's great because it doesn't pander to the lowest comman factor. If you don't ""get"" the Twilight Zone, that's your loss. It won't even slow down a beat to look back to see if you are still following. Simply put, it's smart. It's direct. It's 25 minute snippets of a dream realized fully. Not many people can say they had a vision and were able to see it to its conclusion. That's the Twilight Zone.
I don't believe I am at the portions where the ""eye"" is gone in the menu set-up, but I ""had"" the singular Volumes 20 and 25 at one time and know how well the menu set-up was changed and am eagerly looking forward to that.

Not having the ""Serling"" round table discussions on this dvd set that are on my laser disc versions, still force me to hang on to them. Hopefully, a compilation in the future could be made. Note to FOX or whoever owns the rights, I can with little shame say I'd pay any price to have them all together on one convenient disc.
Even as an avid fan of the original Star Trek, I have come to the conclusion that the Twilight Zone is/was the best show TV ever produced, and is in every way the Beatles of television. Today, I watched the episode the Obsolete Man, which is one I hadn't seen for a very long time (I don't have cable and the ""TZ marathons"" haven't been on for ages). After viewing it, I came to the conclusion also that that one episode had been worth my money ... then I remembered, I still have 30 some odd episodes to watch in Collection 2!

--Five Characters In Search of An Exit: Why have five characters (a soldier, a jester and a ballerina, among them) awoken to find themselves in an empty room with no doors or windows??? One of the single coolest episodes in the series!

290855,5,6300270068,"This a must-buy, just like the first set.  Before these sets came out, I was buying each DVD for 15 bucks a piece.  Here, you get nine for less than a hundred dollars, so... you do the math.  The second set is wonderful.  It includes some of the scarier episodes like ""Living Doll"" and that other one with the ventriloquist dummy - Okay, so I can't remember the name of the episode right now... sue me.  Episodes like those still retain their spooky-factor, even though they were made many years ago.  The remastered B&W looks great, and Rod is very cool as usual.  Due to the slim-line cases, the box doesn't take up very much room, which was a big plus for me.  If you are any kind of TZ fan at all, you really cannot pass this up.
I have read some reviews of these DVD's that complain about the ""Eyeball Menu"" format being annoying and hard to work with - which they were!...  I wanted to point out that they must have been listening, because around Volume 14, they changed the format to something much less animated but easier to work with by far.  The eyeball is gone, no jarring music, and the text information does not advance by itself anymore.  Overall, it is a vast improvement.

290856,4,6300270068,"It could be said that the episodes on this compilation share a common theme of getting a chance to start again. They are, however very different. While i found The Trade-Ins a pleasant, if unspectacular watch, Third From The Sun blew my top.
  In a strong contrast to the Trade-Ins, an emotional episode, Third From The Sun is a nervous, tight piece of doomsday fear. I must say, the USA of late 50's let some VERY thinly disguised political criticism be broadcast..The strong visual style and the pacifist theme of the story remind me very much of the Outer Limits.
  Third From The Sun is one of those very few TZ episodes that might have worked even at 45 minute length. The tension starts in the first scene and keeps up until the end...and what an end!
  I strongly recommend this episode to anyone comparing TZ and Outer Limits unfavorably. The two series had a LOT in common, Twilight Zone is just a lot more varied. And oh yes, The Trade-Ins isn't a waste of time either :-)",1037232000,,982,4.48876404494382
290857,4,6300270068,"The episode ""The Obsolete Man"" is a philosophy lecture in video form, as T-Z episodes always tended to be. The problem is that if you inject some lesson into entertainment, a lot of people aren't going to entirely get the point. To this day, the consensus on this episode is mostly that it's Cold War-era ""boogeyman"" propaganda about totalitarian societies--its resemblance to certain scenes in the screen version of Orwell's ""1984"" tends to create the misapprehension that it's an offshoot. But what librarian Wordsworth has been busted for is that he deals in a banned item--books. Burgess Meredith as Wordsworth has always had a talent for playing bookish types and Fritz Weaver is almost typecast as the tyrant he faces. It's a standard cliche that totalitarian regimes don't like people to read the wrong things because it might lead to disloyalty. Nazi Germany burned books because of that very rationale. More recently, the Religious Right did the same during the 1980s here in America. In the case of both symbolic acts, there was a loud and avid audience for any such event. Nobody likes people who read too much--at least nobody that matters. Is the term ""bookworm"" an accolade? Hell no. ""Excessive reading"" is one of the classic symptoms of the nerd--he can't relate to real people because he's always reading. It's always assumed that when a kid wears coke-bottle glasses, too much reading is why. When I was a kid, if my dad had been required to pay a fine to me every time he spoke the phrase ""with his nose in a goddam book"", he might not have gone broke--but I would have gotten a bigger allowance from him than I actually did get on a weekly basis. When a neighboring county ran into a budget deficit this year, library services were among the first cutbacks. I guess the lesson I see in this episode is that books might indeed be considered as a ""toxic substance"" by totalitarian societies, but the grassroots bias against too much reading because it isn't ""cool"" is a problem in and of itself. A lot of people don't like reading because it bores them, but when people impose that preference on others, you don't have to live in a Fourth or Fifth Reich for something to be wrong with that picture.",1035849600,4,2215,4.711340206185567
290858,5,6300270068,"THE FEVER from the First season aired on January 29, 1960 and was written by Rod Serling. Everett Sloane is brilliant as a married man who continually lectures his wife on the pitfalls of gambling after winning a trip to Las Vegas. Goaded into it Sloane puts a coin into a slot machine, wins and the cycle begins. This is an interesting episode, not necessarily against gambling but one that addresses the nature of obsession and the lengths of self-destruction that it can lead to. It also addresses a familiar TWILIGHT ZONE theme about man and his confrontation with the machines that he creates. THE DUMMY from the Third season aired on May 4, 1962 and was written by Rod Serling. Cliff Robertson plays a down-and-out ventriloquist who has dilutions that his mannequin may be getting the better of him. This is an interesting study into the mind of man and the manmade with a denouement that is riveting. THE AFTER HOURS remains just as fresh and effective as when it was first aired on June 10, 1960 and its lingering haunting imagery remains engraved into one's subconscious. Who can ever forget Anne Francis as Marsha. Her impeccable performance and exquisite face are indelible. ""Marsha"" that very name and the way it was repeated over and over was so eerily unsettling sending chills down one's spine. This episode when compared to WALKING DISTANCE demonstrates the great versatility of Rod Serling as a writer. WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best prose that Serling ever penned where every bit of dialogue was so heartfelt and moving. In THE AFTER HOURS Serling gives us a more visual tale where the storytelling is more dependent on the images. Serling gives us a story of two strikingly opposite worlds that co-exist within a department store. The vivid contrast and the realistic depiction of those two worlds is at the core of this story that has a strange tinge of melancholy about it. Thanks to effective lighting, production design, photography, Douglas Heyes' Direction and impeccable acting it succeeds on all levels and is one of the definitive episodes of the series. Your heart kind of goes out for Telly Savalas in LIVING DOLL. As much of a no-good creep of a stepfather Savalas is, you just gotta feel bad for this guy as he gets outdone by a doll, Talky Tina. The doll is almost as evil as he is and this becomes very evident in the final scene at the bottom of the living room staircase. A lot of the viewers' ambiguous feelings are the result of Bermard Herrmann's innovative score. It has a childlike quality that taunts and teases both Telly Savalas and the viewer. This is an excellent episode written by Charles Beaumont from the Fifth season and is one of the best and most memorable from the entire series. This is an excellent volume.",1025395200,22,2769,4.746887966804979

The third episode is the legendary Talking Tina story where she tells Telly ""Kojak"" Savalas how she's going to kill him, and accomplishes the deed.

The two missing episodes are ""A Passerby"" and ""Come Wander With Me,"" which are indeed available on DVD, but only through Columbia House Video. I subscribed to the library and received a volume (which, incidentally, is enclosed with a new sleeve and photos) that has the two episodes.
I do not reccomend that TZ fans subscribe to the collection simply because they charge and arm and a leg (each volume, shipped monthly, comes out to [price] which includes the tax and shipping costs). I notice that here at Amazon.com most of the volumes are under[price], if not more, and there is no tax applied.
Deplorably, I subscribed to the library thinking that it would be entirely exclusive, but it is not, so you have been forewarned. So at this time I am going to ship back all the volumes that I received from CHV and be credited accordingly. My excuse in writing will be that they claimed exclusiveness, a blatent falsification in my book.

So you can see two pairs of episodes from the celebrated television anthology series created by Rod Serling without stretching too far.

Episode 24, ""Long Live Walter Jameson"" (Written by Charles Beaumont, First aired March 18, 1960) features the familiar face of Kevin McCarthy (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") in the title role.  Jameson bought the gift of immortality two thousand years ago from an alchemist and has seen all of his wives, children and friends grow old and die over and over again. Now he wants it all to be over. This first season episode features some nice special effects work with makeup as Jameson ages rapidly at the end.

Episode 83, ""Dead Man's Shoes (Written by Beaumont and OCee Ritch, First aired January 19, 1962), begins with Nate Bledsoe (Warren Stevens) putting on a pair of expensive shoes taken from a murdered gangsters.  The dead man's spirit takes over Bledsoe's body and tracks down his killer, refusing to be denied vengeance.  Rather straight forward this is an average ""Zone"" at best.  However, if you were watching the second version of ""The Twilight Zone"" in 1985, you might have caught the remake of this episode as ""Dead Woman's Shoes.""

Episode 134, ""You Drive"" (Written by Earl C. Hamner, Jr., First aired January 3, 1964) tells of Oliver Pope (Edward Andrews), who kills someone in a hit-and-run accident and then discovers that his car will not let him forget what he has done. A nice little chiller from the man who created ""The Waltons,"" who usually wrote the kindler, gentler episodes of the ""Zone.""  The result is what you would call an average episode.

Episode 135, ""The Long Morrow"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired January 10, 1964) features a fine performance from Robert Lansing as Commander Douglas Stansfield. Before leaving for deep space Stansfield meets Sandra Horn (Mariette Hartley). The two fall in love, but Stansfield's mission will take 30 years, during most of which he will be kept in suspended animation. After he leaves, Sandra has herself put into hibernation. But you know the course of true love never runs smooth in the Zone.  You can see the O. Henry ending coming, but still a nice episode.

Besides the Twilight Zone twists, the best I can come up with is most of the characters are asked to believe things they think are impossible are really happening to them.  In Rod Serling's ""A Most Unusual Camera,"" Chester Diedirch (Fred Clark) discovers that one of the items he has stolen is a camera that takes instant pictures of events--five minutes in the future.  Once the camera proves it works, Chester along with his wife (Jean Carlson) and brother-in-law (Adam Williams) take it to the track and use it to make a killing.  But when they learn that the inscription in French on the camera says ""Ten to an owner,"" the trio fight over how to best use the remaining photos.  The ending on this one gets a bit too cute.  ""The Jungle,"" written by Charles Beaumont and based on his short story, find engineer Alan Richards (John Dehner) has returned from a project in Africa under a voodoo lion curse.  It seems the local witch doctor took exception to the hydroelectric dam he built.  Alan's wife slips him a protective charm, but unfortunately he leaves it behind in a bar one night.  A nice little tale of suspense which works well with minimal special effects.
In Serling's ""The 7th Is Made Up of Phantoms,"" a trio of men in a National Guard tank on maneuvers near the Little Big Horn keep coming across signs that ""Custer's Last Stand"" is about to take place.  Connors (Ron Foster) and McCluskey (Randy Boone) become convinced they are chasing the past, but Langsford (Warren Oates) believes they are crazy.  Then McCluskey is shot in the back with an arrow.  This episode harkens back to those days when Custer was still admired.  ""Uncle Simon"" by Serling stars Cedric Hardwick as Simon Polk, an inventor who has kept his only heir, niece Barbara (Constance Ford) as his servant.  The pair detest each other, and when he tries to strike her with a cane, Barbara pushes Simon down the stairs.  Thinking she is finally free of her uncle, Barbara learns that his will stipulates she has to look after his last invention, a robot.  This does not prove to be as much fun as you might think.

290931,4,6300270068,"Volume 18 in ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series offers an interesting combination of two space stories with one about the Civil War.  ""I Shot an Arrow Into the Air,"" written by Rod Serling and based on an idea by Madelon Champion, relates how the U.S. spaceship Arrow One disappears off the radar screen and crashes.  Three of its astronauts survive the crash and find themselves on what they take to be an asteroid with only five gallons of water between them.  Corey (Dewey Martin), decides the only way to survive is to kill the other two.  Another spaceship is featured in the hour-long ""Death Ship,"" written by Richard Matheson and based on his short story.  The E-89 investigates something shining on the surface of a planet and discover what looks to be their own wrecked ship and dead bodies.  Lieutenants Mason (Ross Martin) and Carter (Fredrick Beir) become convinced they are dead, but Captain Paul Ross (Jack Klugman), will have none of that.  ""Still Valley"" by Serling based on Manly Wade Wellman's short story ""The Valley Was Made Still,"" stars Gary Merrill as Paradine, a Confederate scout who stumbles upon a town filled with Union soldiers all standing frozen.  An old man (Vaughn Taylor) has used a book of black magic to work this miracle.  The old man is dying and begs Paradine to take the book and use it to win the war.

The sound effects are campy (even for 1960), the humor is off, and Jack Wardens perfomance is plain poor and over blown. He turned in one of the best performances EVER for the Zone in ""The Lonely"" but here, I suppose, the material he had to work with was sub-par. ""Casey"" himself is not even likeable, none of the characters are. A Formality Episode.
Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up: 3 stars A decent ep. that seems to be a fan favorite but for me ""the old giggling man"" is pretty annoying. Most will recognise a Trek doctor here and he turns in a fine performance. The ending is classic, sans for the silly makeup.
The Changing Of The Guard: 3.5 stars Pleasance is great in this episode. Even greater is the meaning behind it all. Whether we know it or WE ALL MATTER. Whether you teach or not your existance at some point WILL influence another in a positive way. Thats the meaning I got from it. A touching episode.
Come Wander With Me: 4.5 stars This ep. is great because the song is haunting and it also has a rather strange ending and meaning. I really love how ""Floyd Burney"" kept running around this Zone proclaiming for God and Country, ""I'M FLOYD BURNEY!"" As though it mattered to these people. A Caution for you ego-maniacs: it doesn't matter who you are, but WHO KNOWS YOU!

I generally do NOT like the comedy Zones for when I watch the Zone I prefer serious Sci-Fi but all has been saved here with a tremendous performance of ""Shakespeare"". He is quite funny and ironic. The star of this ep is almost as endearing and about the first 5 min. of this ep you will hate it ... but let Serling do his magic and you too will see the magic of the Bard. The ending is silly though and adds little to the script ... I thought a nice touch would have been had he conjured up Serling himself! ... and the producers would have acted as though they'd never heard of him!
The Fear*** : This ep started out smashingly put alas was ruined by a terrible ending. An obvious 5 season ep. The two leads, in fact the only two people seen in this ep are actually very good actors, so good in fact they acount for all of the three stars because the story wasn't much either.
The Bewitchin Pool**** : I bought this dvd for this ep and was a bit let down (I thought this would be a 5 ringer). I marvel at why the beginning of the ep they actually show you the end! Aunt T is great the kids are good too, I watched this one several times in my youth and have since loved it. A surprisingly endearing ep which has a few too many overdubs with the voice work but in the end spins a story that I imagine is a dream of many, the simple life.",984873600,14,1414,3.982394366197183

These things tend to be seated in the case FIRMLY! OK ...
Execution***1/2 : I'd never seen this ep before buying this set. It showcases a very convincing performance by Gilligans ""The Professor"" and by Joe Caswell (Al Sami). The ending surprised me a bit and thats a good thing.
The Hunt***** : I suppose there comes a time when our personnal favorites win out over TRUE perfection. I had read a review of this ep once and the writer thought it was ""eh"". That surprised me. There is no real climax here but the loving hand applied by the two leads in the cast are very endearing to me. I bought this disc for this ep alone, and wasn't let down by my memory of it.
""Salvador Ross""*** 1/2 : Some may say Twilight Zone is all about great writing, I don't agree. The acting performanace by the lead here is tremendous even though the story by the time this ep was made was old hat. I had also, never seen this ep either before this disc, I'm learning that there are many gems out there yet undiscovered.

290985,5,6300270068,"Volume 41 of ""The Twilight Zone"" contains `Easter Eggs.' `Easter Eggs' are hidden extras on the DVD which are not listed on the cover or even mentioned in the main menu. They have their own menu page and you have to navigate around until you find them! `COME WANDER WITH ME' for instance contains an isolated music track. Many people complained about the reissue of `THE ENCOUNTER' on DVD in Vol. 33. However, it was reissued because it contains an `Easter Egg.' `THE ENCOUNTER' contains an isolated music track! Now, on to the main review!
`COME WANDER WITH ME' has been a long-overlooked episode which first aired on May 22, 1964. It is a very strange and enigmatic tale written by Anthony Wilson and directed by Richard Donner. It stars Gary Crosby as a folk singer who ventures into the backwoods in search of his next hit song. He's a con man who steals authentic folk ballads by using a tape recorder and Gary Crosby is brilliant in this role. Crosby brings a real facade of charisma that the role demanded and he makes this episode work. This is a very atmospheric episode that does not hit you right away. You may not even like it. But its haunting images and singular tune may linger with you and you may just revisit this one again and again (that's a little hint about the story). I have done so many times and this one of my favorite episodes right up there with `WALKING DISTANCE' and `NIGHTMARE AT 20,000 FEET.' I highly recommend `COME WANDER WITH ME.' `THE MIGHTY CASEY' is an enjoyable little episode written by Rod Serling about a down and out baseball team that gets a little help from a robot named Casey. The very dependable Jack Warden as usual turns in a good performance. `A PIANO IN THE HOUSE' which first aired on February 16, 1962 shows the cruelty that lies beneath the surface of some people. Barry Morse is at his best as he uses a player piano to make his guests reveal their innermost feelings and desires in a most vicious fashion. The late Joan Hackett is very good as she underplays her role as his abused wife. Earl Hamner, Jr. wrote a brilliant and memorable script for this episode as he chose a different tune to reveal each character as it was played on the piano. As for being memorable, `WILL THE REAL MARTIAN PLEASE STAND UP' is one of the most remembered and identified episodes. Written by Rod Serling with an original airdate of May 26, 1961 it is the story that takes place in a diner where passengers of a bus trip are stranded.

290986,4,6300270068,"CAVENDER IS COMING seems to have some inspiration from Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as angel Jesse White must earn his wings by aiding a screwball human played by Carol Burnett. This is one of the few episodes that I saw for the first time ever on this DVD. My original expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised by some innovative photography, stunts and Burnett's excellent performance. Rod Serling actually wrote a very good comic episode from which the viewer can actually make parallels to real life situations thanks in part to Burnett's energetic approach to her part. Greatly underrated. PASSAGE ON THE LADY ANNE credited to writer Charles Beaumont from the 4th Season is an interesting story of a troubled couple's (Joyce Van Patten and Lee Phillips) attempt to rekindle their marriage aboard an antiquated ocean liner the Lady Anne. However, the antiquated ship's passengers consist solely of the elderly.  The cast really makes this an enjoyable episode. It includes Wilfred Hyde-White, Gladys Cooper, Cecil Kellaway and Alan Napier. THE BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S written by Rod Serling for the 5th Season seems to tread familiar territory which had been previously visited and done much better. It focuses on industry, man and machines. It features Richard Deacon, Paul Newlan, Ted DeCorsia and Burt Conroy. I never met an episode of the ""Twilight Zone"" that I didn't like. I just like some more than others. I am sure that for some people this episode holds some endearment. And that is the magic of the ""Twilight Zone.""",982800000,3,1553,5.01937984496124
290987,5,6300270068,"The best TZ edition I've ever seen. I got the 2-video set just before they went out of stock. This set includes some of the hugest masterpieces in the history of the Twilight Zone.  In volume 1, we see a very interesting film in which Serling himself introduces the Twilight Zone to potential sponsors followed by the pilot episode, ""Where is Everybody?"" (starring Earl Holliman). Then, the controversial, kind of ho-hum episode involving an ex WWII mariner (Neville Brand) and a Japanese-American(George Takei), ""The Encounter"", and the best one on the tape, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"". Volume 2 has probably the best TZ episodes ever made: ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""The Masks"", and ""The Howling Man"". To top it off, a vintage edition of the Mike Wallace Interview with Rod Serling about his career and about censorship in television. If only they hadn't stopped making this in video form. It's much cheaper than buying both DVDs, and it comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",982281600,,971,4.957055214723926
290988,5,6300270068,"These two episodes are immortal examples of the very essence of what ""The Twilight Zone"" is all about. `NOTHING IN THE DARK' and `THE INVADERS' are two very classic examples. They focus one the isolation of the individual and the fears that one creates. By our own willingness through self-fortitude we face those fears. And perhaps the very nature of those fears was not what we had made them out to be. The performances by Agnes Moorehead, Gladys Cooper and Robert Redford make these episodes very tangible for the emotional response of the viewer. Very effective and highly recommended viewing.",982195200,2,597,4.98
290989,4,6300270068,"This volume includes my favorite episode, ""Once Upon A Time"", A crazy episode that takes place in the year 1890, in a little town of Harmony, NY. Silent Film star Buster Keaton stars as a Woodrow Mulligan, a disgruntled janitor of a scientist who invents a time helmet that accidentally transports Mulligan into the year 1962. The craziest thing about this episode is that in the scenes of Harmony in 1890, you see the episode in silent film formant with piano music, captions, and sped up filming. Then in the scenes of Harmony in 1962, the episode goes to origonal TZ format with dialogue and sound. Anyway, the episode is hilarious. A must-see for TZ viewers, and just about everyone else.",980985600,,692,4.7272727272727275
290990,3,6300270068,"* ""A Nice Place To Visit"" (Eps. 28, aired 4/15/60) - When Gangster Rocky Valentine (Larry Blyden) gets shot to death, he is welcomed to a world where he gets everything he wants and wins at everything. But, when he gets bored, he finds out he is just getting his just deserts. Three Stars.
* ""A Penny For Your Thoughts"" (Eps. 52, aired 2/3/61) - With a lucky flip of a coin, bank clerk Hector Poole (Dirk York) gains the ability to read people's minds. But, as he soon discovers, you can't believe everything that people think. This is a more comedic than serious Twilight Zone episode, and gets four stars.
* ""Little Girl Lost"" (Eps. 91, aired 3/16/62) - Late one night, the Miller's six year old daughter, Bettina, can be heard throughout the house, but can't be found anywhere. With the help of a physicist friend, they discover a hole from Bettina's room to possibly the fourth dimension. Will the Millers be able to save their daughter in time? Although it has a X Files feel and it was a basis for a later Simpson's episode, the effects limitations of that time really shows. Two stars.
* ""I Am The Night - Color Me Black"" (Eps. 146, aired 3/27/64) On the morning of the execution of an idealist who murdered a racist bully, the sky has turned pitch black around the town. Emotions run high as the time of execution approaches. This story, penned by Rod Serling, gets somewhat preachy at times, but is still good. Three stars.

290992,5,6300270068,"Six episodes of the ""Twilight Zone"" were recorded directly onto videotape instead of film. STATIC is one of those episodes. It was written by Charles Beaumont and directed by Buzz Kulik. It starred veteran character actor Dean Jagger as a cantankerous old man tired of the mundane quality of television. Confined to a boarding house full of idly comfortable couch potatoes, he longed for the simplistic days of his beloved radio broadcasts and for a fellow boarder whom he once loved but was never able to express his feelings for. This is one of the best episodes of the ""Twilight Zone"" and is a companion piece to KICK THE CAN. Because it was recorded direct to videotape it suffers from the technical shortcomings from that era and loses all its dramatic impact. I never realized how good this episode was until I watched this DVD. STATIC should have been the classic episode it was meant to be right up there with WALKING DISTANCE. I recommend this one from the heart.
FOUR O'CLOCK is a tour de force for actor Theodore Bikel as a man bent on exposing all evil at 4 o'clock. I believe that this is Rod Serling's commentary on the McCarthy era. This is a very memorable and important episode.
THE PARALLEL is a fourth season hour episode written by Rod Serling. Steve Forrest gives a very good performance as a returning astronaut whose life seems to contain very subtle changes. I read some criticism about Steve Forrest's ""wooden performance."" On the contrary, Steve Forrest is the professional United States Marine pilot who remains cool headed and objective while trying to analyze the dilemma he is now in. This is a good episode.",973382400,15,1638,4.750877192982456
290993,5,6300270068,"Richard Matheson again came up with another ingenious twist on the sci-fi genre with ""The Invaders,"" a dialogueless masterpiece in which a  ""farm-house woman"" is stalked inside her cabin. It's no  ""Nightmare at 20,000 feet,"" but still very enjoyable. George  Clayton Johnson's finest script is filmed in ""Nothing in the  Dark,"" the most brilliant and moving episode that The Twilight Zone  has to offer.

291036,5,6300270068,"For those who think of the great Agnes Moorehead only as  ""Endora"" from ""Bewitched,"" then, they have not  experienced the range of one of film's most capable character actresses.  ""The Invaders"" offers the actress the chance to have a field day  as a seemingly mute farmwoman whose home has been invaded by Lilliputian  visitors from ""out there.""  With a gloriously effective Jerry  Goldsmith score, this classic episode not only has bravura acting from  Moorehead, but the ingenious use of puppets and miniatures, along with  interesting camera angles and lighting.
The end ""revelation"" is  still a shocker!
It doesn't matter which episode is paired with this  one, as is ""Nothing in Dark.""  ""The Invaders"" is an  investment worth making on its own.",968457600,,750,5.099173553719008
291037,3,6300270068,"The monster scene in the beginning was a hoot for me. To see these two famous comedic actors in a scary comedic skit is just great!
The first segment is alright. Many say it ends to abruptly, but thats because the  actor in it was killed in the final helicopter chase segment in Vietnam. So  now you know, God rest his soul.
The second one TRIES to be a spielberg  awe production, but its to cutesy.
What the hell was the third one, i  forgot?
The one with John Lithgow on the plane is worse than the original  episode with William Shatner himself! The only improvement is Lithgows  acting (sorry, will).
But the reason I rate this movie to begin with is  the ending. You know, in the beginning Dan Akroyd asks if his friend in the  car wants to see a little trick, and turns into a monster and kills him!  Then, in the end, John Lithgow is being taken away in the ambulance, and  the driver begins talking to him.

291039,5,6300270068,"... just kidding.  ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"" is one of the best Twilight Zone episodes ever, and it is included in this DVD. Written by series creator Rod Serling, it is obviously based on ""Six  Characters in Search of an Author"", a 1921 theater play by italian  Luigi Pirandello, which also inspired Paul Sartre's ""No Exit"".  It's a claustrophobic story about a soldier, a ballet dancer, a clown, a  musician and a wonderer trapped in a cilinder shaped room with no doors...  the outcome is sorpresive, incredibly original and terrifying. Vincenzo  Natali, a canadian filmmaker, also took a very similar ground for his  sci-fi movie ""The Cube""... The other episodes included are  ""Mirror Image"" (Season 1) where a woman finds a  ""double"" of herself (scary), ""Dust"" (Season 2) about a  man's execution and ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"" (Season 5),  about a man that believes that his life depends on his grandfather's clock  .

It could have been season by season, or according to the episode numbers, to the air dates or even conceptual (horror, time travel, extraterrestrials,  etc). In this DVD, you can find a little bit of everything (different  seasons and subjects). First we have an episode from season one (""Long  Live Walter Jameson), which is -by far- the best episode found here: a  history expert is actually an immortal being.  From the third season we  have ""Dead Man's Shoes"", gangster's shoes actually, with a  terrible curse. Both of these shows were written by Charles Beaumont. After  that we get two episodes from the fifth and final season, ""You  Drive"", a highly probable inspiration for Stephen King's Christine or  ""The Car"", and ""The Long Morrow"" -the only story here  written by creator Rod Serling- with a space sci-fi plot...
