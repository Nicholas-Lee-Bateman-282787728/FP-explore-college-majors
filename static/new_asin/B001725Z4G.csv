8264748,3,B001725Z4G,"Firstly, straight off the bat, this film is weak. It meanders and flounders and it telegraphs it's 'happy  ending'. The characterisation is poor - they may be 'Indian guys' but they read like washed-up frat-house material - and the acting isn't note-worthy.

The main character is Neil, a 27 year old who works in an office, and who is going through a 'quarter life crisis' because he has just moved in with his girlfriend Angel, and feels trapped. He also has a group of friends, headed by out-going Jonathon.

However, there is something interesting in the middle of this film, it explores the vacuum of the modern dating scene and the superficial people who inhabit it. Anyone who's actually looking for love out there is likely to get lost in a dizzying maze of frustration, judgement, emotions, and , er, technology. Some people give up on a date at the jump of a hat; for example, Neil's friend Jonathon doesn't chat up a girl because she has her eggs 'sunny side up', and there's a speed-dating send-up where Neil rejects the girls or they reject him. It seems ever since he left Angel he can't meet anyone with whom he connects with.

This interesting bit doesn't drag the movie past a 2 1/2 star rating.",1346025600,,1212,4.623255813953488
8264749,1,B001725Z4G,"This movie is a challenge to Eurocentricity; it does show a slice of Asian-American male life rarely seen in film.  Too often, either no characters are Asian-American males or just one is, and he is usually to the peripheries and not essential to the script.  Say what you want about ""Harold and Kumar,"" but the film did center Asian-American males in a valiant way.  This work goes even further than ""Harold and Kumar.""  Here, the main character is Indian-American, so is his love interest, and so are most of his friends.  Many people may think that Asian Americans are only surrounded by each other when at home with their nuclear family.  However, there are neighborhoods in Southern Cal, Northern Cal, Washington State, New Jersey, etc. where Asian Americans are the majority and are far from being the only brown or yellow face in the mix.  I love how this movie centers an oft-forgotten group.

However, this was a bad film.  It had bad writing and amateurish actors.  I can only give it so many PC points.",1251936000,5,1013,4.704545454545454
