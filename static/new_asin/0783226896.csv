54559,5,0783226896,"What a funny movie! I can't figure out the folks who gave this movie such low marks. It's not a movie to be taken seriously, guys. Just a good time to be had by all who watch it. There's not much to add to the other positive reviews of this movie except that it's great to see an upbeat movie that has a moral and morale building continuously throughout - not too often in these politically correct, anti everything times. Yeah, cliche's reign throughout, but it's the way they're presented that makes this movie work. Definitely not just a guy flick and definitely not a waste of two hours. I bought it and watch it at least twice a year. I advise you all to do the same!",991094400,,672,4.2578125
54560,5,0783226896,"This is one of these rare classic comedies you don't want to miss. You'll laugh your heart out. Through some odd circumstances a wealthy NYC developer (Tim Allen) gets in trouble with the IRS. Suddenly, he and his wife (Kirstie Alley) must flee from the authorities and they must leave their wealth behind. The couple ends up in Amish country and there they fake to be Amish cousins of a certain Amish family so that they can remain in hiding until their legal mess is cleared up. Everything's going crazy as the worldly couple tries to fit into this religious community. It's a fun movie and a laughfest so very rare these days. There's plenty of suspense as the IRS is closing in on their hide out, and we think ""For Richer or Poorer"" is one of the best comedies in years.",974246400,6,774,4.457746478873239

54898,5,0783226896,"Received order on time. This stuff is awesome, got it for my old black faded motorcycle jacket. I wore rubber gloves and rubbed this on the entire jacket and still had about a half bottle left over, 1 bottle will do 2 jackets 100%.Clean leather good with wet towel and let dry over night.
Put a little Black Jacket on your fingers and rub into leather, a little goes a long ways. I didn't use the sponge that came with it, I just poured a little in cup that came with it and just used the tips of my fingers. Wear rubber gloves!
Keep a towel close and wipe off of zippers and metal snaps. Hang jacket to dry over night. You can buff lightly with towel if you want a vintage look before it drys.
My black jacket looks and feels brand new.
 Before wearing I would put a conditioner or protector on the leather as you would any new leather jacket.
Just ordered a second bottle for a buddy to use on his older leather motorcycle seat. Good stuff, gave 5stars.",1453593600,,955,4.218579234972678

55053,5,0783226896,"Very simply my favorite comedy, no, my favorite MOVIE of all time!  Yeah, the premise is hokey, and some of the slapstick is wild, but what really makes this flick tick is the incredible synergy between Allen and Alley, the director's unending creative touches, and the remarkable combination of I-can't-stop-laughing humor with timeless and absolute values. Trust me--and the other 257 reviewers who nearly gave this movie a perfect score: you'll be glad you watched and laughed and cried along with the rest of us! (And by the way, this movie received 2/4 from Ebert and perhaps consequently lost money at the box office.  That shows you can't go by those results.)",1425081600,,667,4.946428571428571

It has brought on so many great conversations with my daughter and I.  We discussed how Amish live and what we have (electricity, tv, internet, and indoor plumbing) and what they don't have. It made her rethink being thankful and love.

55446,5,0783226896,"Wonderful story line that draws in the viewer and holds his attention until the very end.  The busy business partnership that became the foundation of the main characters' marriage (Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley) proved inadequate when the money disappeared and they became fugitives from justice.  Divorce was imminent but it would have to wait until they sorted out their situation--amid the Amish (where they ""landed"" in flight from the FBI).

As the story line evolves there are changes in the characters' hearts.  Conflict resolution comes from the salve that is the simplicity of the Amish way of life.

Gorgeous scenery and colorful characters round out this upbeat comedy. It is one to own and view over and over with those you love.",1252713600,,739,4.975609756097561
55447,2,0783226896,"I wonder why this movie is so well-known.  It has some serious dismerits:

1.  It's tough to swallow.  The plot could have been much better without sacrificing much of the comedy.

2.  Er, what comedy?  The movie takes itself so seriously on so many occasions that you wonder if we're really here to laugh.

3.  The ""peek at Amish society"" was much better done in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Witness-Special-Collector-s-Edition-Widescreen/dp/B0009UC7R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Witness (Special Collector's Edition)(Widescreen)</a>; this one has many major inaccuracies.

4.  The hatred between the husband and wife was so convincing, that their later rapprochement isn't.

5.  No subtitles or extras!",1252454400,3,750,6.530612244897959

This is an absolutely hilarious film- I have watched it at least 2 dozen times through the years. I've owned a VHS version for years and was excited to find it on DVD.  This movie never got the credit or acclaim it deserved when it was released.

Tim and Kirstie play Brad and Caroline Sexton, a very unhappy rich couple who (thanks to their embezzing accountant) find themselves on the run from the I.R.S. They end up hiding out in an Amish community under false identities until things blow over. Their transition from the pampered rich to becoming hard working members of the Amish community is hilarious.

I definitely recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good laugh and a ""feel good"" movie.",1127692800,12,672,4.591666666666667

55492,4,0783226896,"""For Richer or Poorer"" is a movie that I've seen several times and one which I enjoy sharing with people who haven't seen it; sharing their reactions to Kirstie Alley's and Tim Allen's antics is a big kick for me.  I paid ... more than I like to pay for a DVD--especially one with so little to offer in Special Features.  (I believe there is nothing in special features because of the age of the film; DVDs were still gaining popularity when this movie was made.)  I wanted my own copy of the film and prefer the DVD format to VHS.  It arived separately from the rest of my Amazon order (via U.S. mail, which was just fine and very timely), and the quality of the DVD picture and sound are fine.  I am pleased with the movie; I just wish it had been cheaper and that there was more to offer in terms of commentary, outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage, etc.  Two DVDs come to mind immediately that are super-packed with Special Features that I just loved:  ""The Planet of the Apes"" (Mark Wahlberg, directed by Tim Burton) and ""Legally Blonde"" (Reese Witherspoon).  I'm pretty sure that the people who put together DVDs will recognize that the buying public prefer discs packed with extra material and will produce more complex packages than this edition of ""For Richer or Poorer.""  That criticism aside, the movie is a must-have for a serious collector of comedy movies, and the DVD format is infinitely preferable to VHS.",1017446400,9,1421,4.607142857142857
55493,5,0783226896,"I think this is a very hilarious movie. Tim Allen & Kirstie Alley are perfect as the couple running away from the IRS and the movie trails the path the couple decides to take when they reside in a very traditional Amish community. They inject some life into the community; Tim helps to plow the fields with ""Big-John"" and Kirstie adds colour into their grey traditional clothes. It is a very humourous movie and it is touching when the couple stand together side by side when the Judge decides to pass a sentence and we know that they have truly reconciled their differences and are a couple again, no longer on the brink of divorce. Everyone should really watch this movie with their families. It is a very enjoyable movie!",1014940800,13,724,4.576923076923077
