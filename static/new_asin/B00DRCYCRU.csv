5848503,1,B00DRCYCRU,"I'm sorry but the acting in this is a joke, why would anyone cast Andrew Gray as the Red Ranger his acting is laughable.  I can not stand to watch this.  He must be related to someone in the industry to be cast in this role, please don't offend the public by casting such an amateur in this role.

5848518,1,B00DRCYCRU,"So, are you cool with paying $50 for a 20 episode season of ANYTHING?  Didn't you think those days were long behind us?  (Well, unless you're paying for some HBO series on Blu-ray that is, but still).  Apparently Lionsgate doesn't think so.  At least for fans of Power Rangers Megaforce. So, let's see 4 episodes for $10 times 5 equals $50.  WOW!  They must think we are stupid, or their tactics worked before. I, like many fans, refused to by PR Samurai because Lionsgate released it 4 episodes at a time.  Same old greedy tactics. ""It's NEW - Let's make em pay through the Nose!""  Then Lionsgate got their act together (I thought) and released Super Samurai as a complete set - all 20 episodes. Now with Megaforce they are back to 4 episode releases? What the heck is going on here?  Greed wins the day again?  Screw that. Why in God's name would anyone, outside of a desperate parent, buy this release? Don't support their greedy tactics. Don't reward them, otherwise they'll keep pulling this crap.  If they sell a ton of these, they'll NOT release a complete season set - they didn't for PR Samurai.  We're finally getting full seasons of past seasons of Power Rangers, with many more episodes, for about $15-$20 per season. Reward that! Even though these are currently on Netflix, they won't be forever and fans should support these full seasons releases. Make Lionsgate bite it.  If you really want to see Megaforce, just check out dailymotion, nick or hulu.",1380153600,19,1465,4.67578125
5848519,5,B00DRCYCRU,"So....what to say about this dvd release of Power Rangers Megaforce. Here's what you get at least. The first four episodes of this new seasons, which marks 20 years that power rangers has been on air. The only special feature on this dvd is the ""morph through the years"" where you see all the red rangers, minus lauren, plus an odd white ranger, basically perform moves as they ""morph"" thru all 20 years. its a cool video, no more than 1minute and change. but seriously, lionsgate could of put more effort being as this is the 20th anniversary.
There are trailers for Clash of the Red Rangers movie, samurai volumes 1-5 on dvd, and super samurai bluray/dvd trailers. As well as a promo for a two movie Robotech double feature. Now here is where I need ya'll to listen carefully. please support these individual releases. Go out and buy volume 1 of megaforce, and volume 2 when it comes out, same for volume 3 and future releases. buy any individual releases, because if lionsgate sees theres people out there wiling to buy these dvds, they may do what we failed to prove to them for the samurai and super samurai releases, and that is there is enough of us out there to release a full megaforce/super megaforce bluray/dvd complete season set. I would love to own megaforce on bluray, and we gotta prove to lions gate its worth the money to do a full season set that includes ALL specials on bluray.
yes this may mean we may need to double dip, but if it guarantees us a complete box set, than so be it. this also means go out there and buy samurai on dvd, go out there and buy super samurai box set, go out there and buy all the specials that have been released so far. we can't afford to be picky and not buying volumes if there is no guarantee about a complete season set. so support your power rangers dvd volumes, because if we don't.....well do you remember what happened to power rangers jungle fury and power rangers rpm dvd volumes?? well if you don't want that to happen, BUY POWER RANGERS ON DVD! power rangers samurai volumes 1-5 are available on dvd, power rangers super samurai volumes 1-5 AND a complete super samurai boxset is out on bluray and dvd, also 2 christmas specials and on halloween special is out on dvd or soon to be, buy them. preorder them.",1378684800,4,2269,4.456730769230769

8596614,5,B00DRCYCRU,"I'm going to be perfectly honest.  I'm not a die-hard power ranger fan, I consider the franchise to be mostly substance-free mindless entertainment.  But this series along with Lightspeed rescue won me over real good!  They finally got some things right.  For a first, the costumes (the Rangers and the monsters) are nicely polished, the story actually makes sense than regulars, and there's a balance of light and darkness.  What I mean is there's some silliness and victory over the enemy and the darkness is that the frightening enemies are ones you should take seriously as their threats and attacks are quite shocking.  I'm grateful this series showed some creative non-violent actions the rangers took to balance off the action the series is famous for.  This is a good start to this series, even paying tribute to old power ranger series as well.  Many fans don't like this series due to what I said earlier, but this is actually the one I wanted the entire franchise to be.",1448496000,,981,4.7976190476190474
