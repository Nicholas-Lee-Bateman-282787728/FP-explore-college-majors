2152231,2,B0002ZDWLM,"Greetings. This is the official review for The Dark Power, which may just  as well have been titled The Dark Flower, seeing as how ridiculous it is, it should warrant a more ridiculous title.

I should warn you, reader, that this is not exactly a B movie. Rather, more like C, or D, if those classifications exist.

The movie has to do with a hill somewhere in the southeastern US, near a college, apparently, that was once a ritual site for ancient Toltec Native American priests. An old Indian acquires the property for the purpose of guarding the local residents in sealing off the dark power that lurks beneath the ground. However, his death leads to the breaking of the protective seals placed around the hill. A group of college girls decide to turn the late Native's residence into a sorority house, but some guys decide it should be a fraternity as well. The ancient priests rise and set out to create havoc.

And it would have been pretty good, too, if the inane Director had been more consistent in his approach as to how the undead Priests should behave and look.

The bottom line is, whoever made this movie sucks!
I can picture their film/video instructor seeing this and shaking his head going, ""I have failed!"" and probably shooting himself in the head. The word 'campy' is too generous here. You will never, ever, be scared of these zombies, or believe for one second that they are Toltec Priests. They look nothing like the part, and what's worse, they never for one second act the part. The entire movie, up to the point of the undead rising, was actually not too bad, but once the mayhem starts, you might as well consider the movie finished, because there's really no reward in watching the last half hour, and the wrap-up is extremely brief before the credits roll.

Is it fun? Kinda. Is it worth 5 dollars? No. Is it worth 3 dollars? Maybe. Is it worth watching? Not really... There are just much better movies out there for this kind of thing. The most I can say is that it was an experience. I'll give it that.",1205798400,16,2034,4.528610354223433
2152232,1,B0002ZDWLM,"I went online and learned that Lash LaRue regreted his involvement in this horribly unwatchable movie. Its obvious the years of drinking had taken their toll on Lash. His speech was slurred and his face shows the years of neglect. I really loved watching him as a child, in those old B movie westerns, but truly felt sorry that he had to stoop so low to being involved in this sad joke. There are better home productions than this one on U-Tube. The writing and directing are almost nonexistent and the acting is even worse. The staged highlight of this film is a girl running around half dressed and another one naked in the tub. These cheesy scenes serve no purpose in telling the story or improving the movie. While the whole idea for the story is not the worst I've ever seen, most of the scenes are clunky and awkward. A good writer could have helped but this director would not have messed any story. The camera work is bush league.

At the begining of the show Lash saves a young boy from some dogs chasing him and doesn't even say a word to him when he goes over to help him up. Your expecting him to say, how are you or are you hurt but the scene just falls flat and moves to the next one. By the time the monsters arrive you may get more chuckles watching your kids in a home movie. The fear factor is a minus 10 if you can bear to keep watching the bad acting. It appears that the director just gather up everyone in this small town and put them in the show. I couldn't even give this movie one star but would give it a few negative stars if it were possible. If you buy this you might as well put a match to your money and throw it out the window. It would be more entertaining than realizing you had just wasted an hour and half of your life that you will never get back. It may even reduce your life span!!!",1199318400,9,1821,4.158640226628895
2152233,3,B0002ZDWLM,"The cheese factor on this is pretty high.  It looks like something a film major could have made with a group of friends over a long weekend.  It's sort of embarrassing when Lash Larue, a former ""star"" of the silver screen, comes to the rescue of this group of pathetic 'tards towards the end of the film.  Without him, it probably wouldn't be worth seeing though.  He's got some mighty fine whippin' skillz!  I believe there's only one scene of nudity, and it's nothing to write home about, so don't buy it for that.  There's a pretty surprising racist overtone throughout the film too, so just be prepared for a little bit of that if you check it out.",1197763200,30,652,4.436974789915967
2152234,4,B0002ZDWLM,"I bought this movie for 3 dollars and I was more than satified. You have a big fat guy with a gastrointestinal problem, a fat kid who steals trucks, an old guy using a whip to kill zombies, and a couple of inadvertant crotch shots of a hot chick. What more do you want? Oh yeah, and the zombies look pretty damn funny. If you looked up B movie in the dictionary you would see: The Dark Power.",1189468800,4,392,4.038461538461538
2152235,4,B0002ZDWLM,"This is a cool, hilarious and campy movie. Camera angles, and filming techniques are a little off. Lash La Rue ""King of the Bullwhip"" is about 63 years old and still commands the bullwhip. Some beautiful collegiate women rent a house in southern USA  which belonged to an old Indian Shaman who had aquired the land of his people form the government prior to his passing. The land is haunted by spiriits of  Toltec warriors who surface to taunt and torture the present occupants of this house. Lash La Rue comes to their rescue in classic Lash fashion. It is filled with unknown actors and relatively poor dialogue, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to any Lash La Rue fans. I plan to view it many more times.",1121299200,29,708,4.48062015503876
8035199,5,B0002ZDWLM,"Another B movie by director/writer Phil Smoot.  Once again Lash La Rue is perfect in his role.  The rest of the cast are good as well.
Fun and entertaining!  I purchased this (as well as Alien Outlaw) after watching them on Rifftrax.",1515283200,,233,4.5

8035203,3,B0002ZDWLM,"This movie has everything. Four evil indian sorcerers, a bunch of college students getting what they deserve, and of course: a heroic park ranger who takes the evil down with nothing but his special whip. The acting isn't that bad for a mid 80's zombie movie. And there is a pretty decent amount of gore. If you're a fan of zombie movies you should at least watch this movie once.",1391040000,,380,4.442857142857143
8035204,5,B0002ZDWLM,"Great direct to video 1980s regional  horror comedy.

Shot on 16mm but very well lit including night-for-night scenes.

Well acted and cleverly written.

Wish there was more stuff like this on DVD!!!",1335312000,,199,5.125
8035205,4,B0002ZDWLM,"If you're into following the acting careers of never was-s, then follow that of Lash La Rue. His only claim to fame is the whip. His acting sucks, and in this it appears he's had a stroke, which is kind of funny. I recommend this piece of garbage to anyone who likes movies with no redeeming value.",1289865600,,298,4.245614035087719
8035206,2,B0002ZDWLM,"Decided to buy this at a bargain bin price. Obviously low budget with very cheesy makeup for the ""zombies"".  The best part of the movie, I must say, is young, very sexy Suzie Martin...too bad she did not act in future movies; she could have been a screem queen.",1265328000,,261,4.326530612244898
8035207,1,B0002ZDWLM,"There have been low budget movies in the past that I've enjoyed,this is not one. The scenes with Lash LaRue and his whip made for some laughs,especially considering he had to been about 80 years old at least,but that was it for me. The makeup and effects consisted of some cheap masks and makeup bought at a halloween store. Boring and stupid in a really awful and lame kinda way. I couldn't bring myself to watch past the first 25 minutes,so I fast fowarded to the last 5 minutes to get it over with. Stay away from this Z grade boring mess. I'm not going to bore you any longer with details of this piece of poops storyline and plot. Your better off spending your 5 bucks on stocking up on toilet paper.",1226448000,5,705,4.30827067669173
