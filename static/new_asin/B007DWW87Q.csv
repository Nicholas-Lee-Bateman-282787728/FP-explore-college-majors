8515062,5,B007DWW87Q,"Playboy's Wild Coed is twenty-eight minutes long and came out in 2011. The DVD could only be attained by renewing your membership to Playboy magazine. There are a total of twelve coeds in this DVD and they each get roughly two minutes and twenty seconds of air time; some more some less. You have two Playboy Cyber Girl of the Week and ten Playboy Coed of the Week. With the exception of Beth Williams and Renee Reese the rest of the ladies were mostly nude or completely nude in their segment. If you blink in the Beth William then you would miss her only complete nude shot. Also included are a twenty-five minute episode of The Stash and a forty-eight minute episode of Swing and this makes this DVD one hour and forty -two minutes. My only complaint about this DVD is there are too many coeds and not enough air time. I would have been happy if there were only six or eight. Playboy's Wild Coeds gets an A-.
