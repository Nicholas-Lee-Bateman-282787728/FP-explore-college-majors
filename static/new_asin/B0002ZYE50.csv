8035629,4,B0002ZYE50,"I suppose I had the good fortune of stumbling onto this series by accident, as it was my first time to view anything in the Knight Hunters franchise, so unlike the other reviewer(s) I had no expectations to be disappointed.  I took this Anime ""as is"".  On its own merits, I found it to be outstanding.  It is slow going at first, but before long the complicated plot reels you in.  Yes, it's sad, yes, it's depressing, but it's also a joy to watch.  The animation is very well done, the English dub actors put a lot of pathos and passion into their roles, and you quickly develop sympathy for the characters, their darkly troubled pasts, and their current, violent struggles.  The series doesn't hold back from killing off major characters, and the body count for the series as a whole is quite high.  But it is still gratifying to watch, and I'm thoroughly glad I watched vols 1-3 of this very short, 13-episode series.  I watched it as a rental, choosing it mainly due to the cover art and the brief episode descriptions on the verso of the DVD case.  I was not disappointed.  I also enjoyed the ""outtakes"" special feature, which are the bloopers and the actors/directors goofing off, inserting ad-lib dialogue that is often hysterically funny.  I wish ADV Films did this with *their* DVDs, but this was by NYAV Post in NYC.

I guess it's sort of like Old vs. New Battlstar Galactica or Star Trek.  Not everyone is going to be happy with the other version, and I guess whichever you see first is what you stick with more often than not.",1222041600,,1538,4.509025270758123
8035630,1,B0002ZYE50,"First of all, this is a sequel series. It's the sequel to 'Knight Hunters', which was actually a good series. The first series is about this group of assassins called Weiss -- Aya, Yohji, Ken, and Omi -- who during the daytime run a flowershop, and in the night take on missions to assassinate evil people.
Get that series first, anyhow.

If you liked Knight Hunters at all, don't buy this. The first 2 volumes of Knight Hunters Eternity weren't bad (or maybe just the 1st volume), but here it gets crazy. The new characters don't get much of a stand, and the old 4 characters are horrible. Yohji, who was an all right guy in the last one, is suddenly crazy and obsessed with his old girlfriend and partner, Asuka (who died). He was obsessed before, but now he's seeing her ghost and he acts really weird. Ken, who was so nice in the last series, is now rather insane and violent. Omi is almost like he was before, except perhaps more helpless and less cute. Aya, actually, has changed for the better, being less rash and somewhat smarter.

Still, when 3/4 of the characters are worse than before, it's hard to accept. The art change isn't bad, by the way; it may be nicer art than the last set (although the change of design is weird).
With the first few episodes of this series I figured it was going all right, but then it got depressing. I don't know if the author decided he hated his characters or what, but it's not fun to watch.

In the end, I don't recommend this at all. Stick with Knight Hunters, and if you finished that, check out a few different things; s-CRY-ed, Fushigi Yuugi, PeaceMaker, or D.N.Angel.
If you liked the music, definitely get Knight Hunters (Wei Kreuz) Best Album.",1163548800,,1696,4.464516129032258
8035631,4,B0002ZYE50,"From buying the first three DVDs, I noticed that there was a slow start to the Wei Kreuz series mainly in vol 1 and 2. But as the series progresses, the story develops more and more around the Takatori family and we are introduced to Schwarz hence there is a lot more excitement throughout the series.  Schuldig gets lots of screen time to begin with and because of this we see what his abilities are i.e. telepathy, speed and mind manipulation.  Actions from the other members follow suit soon after in later episodes.
From where the previous volume left us, Omi is still shocked from finding out he is Takatori Mamoru, who is the younger brother of Masafumi and Hirofumi.  Episodes 11 and 12 focuses on Omi's struggle from realising he is Takatori Mamoru.  Not only did he find out who his brothers are but he also finds out one other secret connecting to Ouka.  There are many family secrets being revealed in this volume and Persia discovers something about him and Omi.  I won't say anymore since it will give away spoilers.  Schuldig takes this opportunity to torment poor Omi about killing both his brothers as well as attempt to get all of Weiss against one another.  Ouka becomes a pawn in this game as a result.
Episodes 13-15 focuses on the rise of Takatori's power as a politician and this concerns Persia, who we learn is Takatori Reiji's younger brother.  Volume 3 of Weiss Kreuz is the conclusion to the first arc of the series.  There's tragedy but there's victory in the end.  Altogether I'd say this volume packs enough excitement for a night or two.",1031011200,,1568,4.60431654676259
8035632,5,B0002ZYE50,"The 3rd DVD, is the best one so far BY far.  Bishies...the bad guys (who are also bishies), and a soap oprea of pasts and family.  You get to see some more of the bad guys (attempting to write without spoilers here), and........SCHU-KUN!
The interviews aren't half bad either, if you understand what they are talknig about.  The outtakes--scared me.  Okay, so they were childishly funny, but I was sweatdropping the whole time.  The english dub isn't exactly worth it.  But, the production sketches are coolie!  You get tosee the sketches of out favorite bishies.  I think this one has Tot and the weapons?
Anyway, the character development is great (even if the animation isn't the best) and it is starting to have a nice plot.  This DVD also marks the end of the first season.  DVD 4 and 5 will be the second season.  It's a great anime, and now, my favorite

8035633,5,B0002ZYE50,"This is a must buy DVD.  If you are into hurt/comfort or angst, then Knight Hunters is the series for you.  If you tried the first DVD and are still unsure, buy this one.  The story has changed from the one shot deals of the first few DVDs to an arc that lasts throughout the remaining episodes.  The characters become much deeper and angstier.  Add to that a great opening theme and very cute boys and you have the receipe for the perfect anime.",1026086400,2,446,4.261904761904762
