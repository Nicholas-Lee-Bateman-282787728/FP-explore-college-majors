1992736,4,B0001DA48E,As a child I rewatched this movie over and over again.  So much so that the recorded beta tape finally gave out on me.  I am happy to see it made it to DVD.  A great movie for kids that love horses.  The conflict between upper and lower class is portrayed very well. The acting is also A+.  A great predictable feel-good movie!,1278288000,,327,4.126984126984127
1992737,5,B0001DA48E,"""Ride a Wild Pony"" is an example of moviemaking for kids at its finest--it is just as interesting for adults to watch as it is for kids, and it doesn't pander with stupid toilet humor or the same old stupid jokes that so many modern kids' movies feel are necessary to engage children. I saw this in theaters when I was young and recently rented it to share with my own child, who loved it. It's a pity that some of the older, well-made Disney films are so very hard to find anymore and yet there's a nonstop flood of straight-to-video derivatives of existing Disney flilcks...The movie's based on a book called ""A Sporting Proposition,"" which is also very, very good. I read it when I was about 13 and reread it as an adult--enjoyed it both times.",1235692800,,747,4.420289855072464
1992738,5,B0001DA48E,"This movie is the only Disney film I've seen that treats the father as the head of the family.  It's a marvelous story of a boy who tames a wild pony, loses the pony--who is purchased by a wealthy girl--and then must fight in the court of law to prove the pony really belongs to him.  ""Ride a Wild Pony"" is no longer available in Los Angeles video stores--we saw it in Mammoth Lakes a few years ago, and fell in love with it! If you are looking for a movie to show your whole family, try this one --my husband thought it was wonderful too--as did my then boys and girls between 8 and 15.",1120521600,5,587,4.051724137931035
1992739,5,B0001DA48E,"A beautiful cream colored Welsh pony is torn between two masters in this interesting Australian-set period piece about a polio-stricken rich girl, Josie (Eva Griffith), and her dirt-poor neighbor, Scotty (Robert Bettles). Each believes that the pony - called Bo by Josie, and Taff by Scotty - is theirs. Each one loves and needs the pony: On Bo, Josie is not crippled; Scotty needs Bo to get to and from school. Neither is willing to share their prize, so the matter must be resolved in a most unusual fashion. Good 'message movie' for kids; fun for kids of the 70s to revisit.

1992740,5,B0001DA48E,"This is a beautiful movie. I got this for a Christmas Present a few years back from my mom. And I love this movie dearly. Robert Bettles stars as a young poor Australian boy, that is given a beautiful Stallion named Taff. But when the horse runs away a rich crippled girl finds it and falls in love with it. But Robert Bettles wants the horse, and she wants it to. So it ends up in a big court battle. In the end Robert Bettles gets the horse but he becomes great friends with the girl, and they go on horse rides together. This film was filmed in the beautiful Pinewood Studios. This movie has beautiful Australian Countryside, and is a great family film not to be missed by any.",1096848000,4,680,4.2384615384615385

1992764,5,B0001DA48E,"I watched this story Black&White back in the late 80`s. Its one of the few movies with a strong young female lead, Golden Compass comes close but women in general are usually depicted as hapless victims of circumstance, not sources of wisdom (unless they're old & homely).",1422576000,,272,4.808510638297872

1992766,4,B0001DA48E,good movie shows how 2 kids learn to share a pony. Has a happy ending. Movie doesn't drag on it keeps you interested.,1395619200,,117,4.130434782608695

1992768,5,B0001DA48E,"I remember this Disney movie from way back in my little girl days.  Since then, I have bred & competed Welsh ponies.  I remembered the ponies in this film looking like Welsh, so I wanted to find it again.  Finally, I found it here & every bit of it is as I remember, including the ponies being Welsh!",1377648000,,300,4.137931034482759
1992769,3,B0001DA48E,"The main character, the boy, is barefoot through the entire movie. The drama over the horse ownership is a bit treacly, but it all ends on a happy note. They also keep the nefarious activity of adults to a minimum so that the story is about the horse and the children. Well, of course the court system is for adults, but nevertheless.",1371859200,,334,4.403225806451613

1992771,4,B0001DA48E,"Couldn't believe how infectious this little nipper was! To look at the picture on the cover I was
sure it was Mark Lester but research proved me wrong so I still gave it a try even though it wasn't.

I seriously thought at first he was a mute,(you'll see!) but he's just very spare with words and when
you finally see that smile it's like watching your baby walk for the first time,( ok, maybe not that great but it'll be appreciated!).

All the pony action is real and he definitely can ride and bareback too, no saddles for this boy!

He never truly sweetens Hollywood style but he does show empathy and comes around in the end.

Nice movie for all.",1363996800,2,651,4.311475409836065
1992772,2,B0001DA48E,"I had high hopes for this movie and bought it for my sons 4th birthday because he is obsessed with horses.  I'm also a fan of old school disney but this movie was lame!  Boring and I'm sad I actually bought a new DVD instead of a cheaper used one.  Oh well, probably won't get a lot of use.  My son doesn't like it too much.",1361577600,,324,3.8636363636363638
1992773,5,B0001DA48E,"The boy did not treat the horse very well at the beginning, but interaction between the boy , the girl and the pony was a good story. children and adults, i think will thoroughly enjoy this dvd. Count on Disney for good family films, with this film showing that Disney is still carrying on what the Founder strived for ""Quality.""",1356566400,,329,4.5
1992774,5,B0001DA48E,This is a great 'old fashioned' Disney movie for the whole family!  I say old fashioned in the sense that there no inappropriate words or situations for children.  Nice for a change after all of the junk on tv and in movies these days.,1348185600,2,235,4.318181818181818
1992775,5,B0001DA48E,"If you like horses/ponies you may enjoy Ride A Wild Pony. Cute movie made in Australia, during a little different era. Good lessons learned for kids AND adults. Could easily provoke discussion on several different levels with children about personalities, being handicapped, civility, ownership and friendship. Beautiful ponies! I love the fact that the pony is ridden and DRIVEN! All ponies should be so versatile! This movie may not be 'professionally polished' (with the main pony character changing). But I still enjoyed this movie as a youngster and again now that I have bought it to own.",1339545600,,594,5.134020618556701

Please don't miss it.  Not a tear jerker, just a good story with a great ending and
two kids you will never forget and hope throughout.",1299888000,,218,4.2926829268292686

1992778,5,B0001DA48E,"This movie centers around two children in Australia.  One a very well-to-do crippled girl and the other a very poor and downtrodden boy who can't go to school because he has no transportation to get there.  Eventually, the authorities arrange for the poor boy's Dad to buy a wild Welsh pony for three pounds.  And the boy is immensely happy.  However, the pony doesn't like being cooped up and escapes.  Only to find himself in the well-to-do girl's herd.  Eventually, there is a court trial to decide who is the actual owner of the pony.  The movie does an excellent job of making it unpredictable who will end up with the pony.  But it is Disney, so eventually all is resolved happily.  There are a lot of class issues throughout the film.  And in all honesty, for the first half of the movie, none of the protagonists were all that likeable.  However, towards the end they become more sympathetic and there are lessons learned on all sides.  Sometimes it is confusing because it seems like two ponies must have used during the filming.  As sometimes the pony appears white and at other times brown.  However, the story is a good one and it makes for a nice family film.  Five stars from me!",1290470400,2,1193,4.535211267605634
1992779,4,B0001DA48E,"""Ride a Wild Pony"" was filmed entirely in Australia in a small
outback town. The color photography is superb and does full
justice to the scenic locations where the movie was filmed.

The story concerns a fight for possession of a wild pony between
a poor boy who has very little and a rich girl who has everything.
Both genuinely believe that the pony belongs to them.

The film shows the hard life the boy and his parents have to
endure to carve out a pitiful existence from non-productive land
and how the pony was first given to the boy by a neighbour to
enable him to get to and from school some seven miles away.

The pony manages to stray off and eventually comes into the
possession of the girl who is crippled and who trains the pony
to pull her horse drawn cart upon which she depends for transport,
not knowing that the pony originally belonged to the boy.

A good story well presented and like all Disney features there is
a happy ending for both children.

I believe that the movie was made by the Disney Studios to be
shown on the television show ""The Wonderful World of Disney""
but it was thought at the time that the movie was so good that
a cinema release was justified.",1287100800,,1187,4.352941176470588
