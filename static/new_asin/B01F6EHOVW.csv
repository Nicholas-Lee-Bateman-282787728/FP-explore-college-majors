7749066,5,B01F6EHOVW,"My girls and I have watched a lot of When Calls the Heart episodes. I love how family friendly they are. I never worry about telling the girls to avert their eyes or singing la la la while a bad scene is quickly skipped.

My Thoughts:
Since this is season three, the actors and actresses are very comfortable with each other and it shows in their on screen relationships. Forever in My Heart was one of the better videos. There were lots of interesting things going on. Most interesting was Rosemary's opportunity to act in a movie! It was entertaining to see how that played out. Lee has troubles at the mill. Prepare for some surprise resolution on that one. Abigail's pours out her heart to the orphans she's cared for and finds that life is often out of control. Mr. Gowen gets a big surprise that ends up surprising the mounties as well. All in all, it was an excellent episode. I really enjoyed it.

If you've not yet watched When Calls the Heart, I highly suggest you do.

7749072,5,B01F6EHOVW,"When Calls the Heart forever in my heart Has to be one of the seasons best written so far. I almost stopped watching this back in season 2. Too much fancy makeup done dresses n all. I was glad to see it to return to Hope Valley. The actors and actresses are outstanding performers that@is what kept me watching the series. If you like the books keep an open mind towards the series for it is obviously not in tune with them. Forever in my heart has definitely won my heart. At one point in the past it almost like it was more towards a soap opera instead of the Christian base I first fell for. this one has brought Gods strength we all come to depend on@ good times or bad. I would like to continue enjoying the future movies to demonstrate more of what Jeanette Oke n Laurel Oke Login write in the Return To The Canadian West series with our everyday life as Christians praising n worshipping God daily_for good times.n thru bad. I loved it the way it ends for the movie. Am excited for the 5th and hopefully looking very forward to a Season 4 series. God Bless  the Actors, Actresses, Directors editors producers to the hole organization to bring us these wonderful stories.",1472688000,,1177,4.3744292237442925
7749073,5,B01F6EHOVW,"When  Calls the Heart-Forever in my Heart is Movie 4 of the third season. I really did enjoy this movie. Many sweet, tearful scenes that I loved.
  Jack tries to help a young couple to get back together whom the husband left, because he is afraid he will be like his dad in the marriage.
  Codys sister Becky comes back from the hospital and is temporarily in a wheelchair. Then the childrens long-lost aunt shows up. She wants to take the children back to live with her.
The sawmill is still being damaged and Rosemary may leave Hope Valley in the hopes of being a star in movies.
  All of these characters and scenes would make a great show, but when they are all together it is fabulous. Love how this show turned out and the love and sweetness of the different scenes.
  Except for the impairment of Lees sawmill, which was quite exciting and adventurous.
  Really love this movie and  you will also. Highly recommended. It is a movie the whole family can watch and be entertained.

7749074,5,B01F6EHOVW,"If you have not watched When Calls the Heart, especially if you were a fan of Little House on the Prairie growing up, you will want to tune it. Thanks to Janette Oke's novel, the Hallmark Channel and Michael Landon Jr teamed up to further the adventures of Elizabeth Thatcher, (Erin Krakow), a woman from a prominent family in Hamilton, and decides to try becoming a school teacher in Hope Valley, out west. Only problem is that life on the frontier isn't at all like Elizabeth might imagine but she is bound and determined to give it ago especially when there are so many children who are in need of a teacher.

Now in its third season, When Calls the Heart, Forever in My Heart has been released on DVD by Word Films and is the 4th DVD in Season 3. The development of some of our favorite characters are about to take another turn. Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) is working with some new settlers who have set up a temporary camp outside of town for men who are working back in the mines. Unfortunately one couple is dealing with the affects of long hours and being new parents and the young husband vows to do what is best for them by leaving. It will take some intervention and heart to heart talks on both ends with Jack to help them realize what is best for their new family.

Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin) has been caring for Cody and Becky Connor's who have lost their parents and has taken on the role of a surrogate mother. Now it seems that a long lost wealthy aunt, Carolyn Conner's is about to uproot the family knowing that she is what is best for them above all the love Abigail has provided without taking their feelings into consideration. Once again, Abigail is about to lose everything she has invested her love in, or will she? Meanwhile Lee's feelings are about to be put to the ultimate test when Rosemary gets the chance of a lifetime, to become the lead actress in a producers movie. The only catch is that she will have to leave Hope Valley to do so. Will she stay for love or leave for fame? Only time will tell.

I received When Calls the Heart - Forever in My Heart compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a copy of this DVD in exchange for my unbiased and personal opinion. I am so thrilled that this has made it to DVD so I can share this with my grandchildren and family whenever they come for a visit. It is so wonderful to find great shows that still teach moral and family values of hard work, community and love in one amazing show. This is Dove Family Approved for all ages, and the DVD runs approximately 84 minutes. There is also some bonus material included as an added bonus.",1471478400,4,2700,4.374501992031872
