Ireland, it is a tragic country with a tragic past that it can't ignore. The section on Cromwell is very controversial as was the man; make up your own mind after seeing this if he was a hero or a villain or both. James II thought he was a bad guy for beheading James I, so he dug Cromwell's skeleton up and hung it.
Just a tad bizarre!",1388016000,,377,4.04

They offered to refund my money, but I'd prefer to know what the problem is. The DVDs have no region restrictions as far as I can tell. I've had good luck with MovieMars in the past.

UPDATE: I've since found out (from descriptions offered by other distributors) that these are Region 2 DVDs and are thus not able to be viewed on USA machines. I've encouraged MovieMars to add this to their product description.",1343174400,10,515,4.309278350515464
