1072510,5,6305791848,Seeing Michael Ball perform live on stage is an experience that will never be forgotten.  The video captures the magic of the live performance and leaves the viewer wanting more.  And more is exactly what you get - a short documentary showing how the show was put together and also following Michael with the tour bus.  The variety of music is endless and shows off the range and quality of Michael's voice in numbers ranging from the classics of musical theatre to rock 'n' roll.  Prepare to be 'blown away' by the power of 'Gethsemane' at the end of the first half of the video - it will never be performed better. The audience play a great part in joining in with the magic atmosphere of one of Britain's greatest performers at one of its most famous venues.  Do not hesistate to buy this video - you will NOT be disappointed in any way.  A magical evening captured forever.,971481600,10,877,4.484276729559748
1072670,5,6305791848,"This is my second review.
Universal Music has now remastered this DVD and I am pleased (thrilled!) to report that all is well with the Dolby 5.1 track. I have just watched Love Changes Everything in 5.1 mode and the video matches the sound perfectly.
So how do I rate this DVD? There are certainly some songs on this DVD that are a bit slow and not too exciting. However at least half of the songs are simply ""stunning"" and, of course, Love Changes Everything turns me into a quivering bowl of jelly every time, so I have to give it a 5 of 5.",1056931200,15,542,4.171428571428572
1072671,2,6305791848,The DVD has the picture out of sync. with the audio. A real annoyance when the camera is close enough to see lips.,1048032000,8,114,4.0
1072672,5,6305791848,"Michael Ball takes DVD performances to another level with a strong connection between musicals and film scores.  Michael's pure voice and interpretation is nothing less than perfection in motion, will totally captivate the moment.  Each cue is beautiful, with a trace of dramatic melancholy that draws you completely in immediately.
You can feel his peaceful and mellow mood with ""EVERYBODY'S TALKIN'"", a great tune sung originally by Glen Campbell and a hit was born, but Michael's voice brings a new meaning to this classic ~ another sensitive song ""LOVE ON THE ROCKS"", the Neil Diamond hit attains new heights with this arrangement and performance ~ memories sends us to ""THE WAY WE WERE""/""THE ROSE"", a medley that brings new feelings of passion and love, as emotion is conveyed with the power and smooth style of Michael's performance.  When asked of John Barry the composer~of all the James Bond themes which is his favorite, his reply was ""WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD"", is also one of my favorite themes, originally sung by Louis Armstrong in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was a highlight in the film, but this rendition on the DVD is incredible.
Most highly recommend this DVD, exceeds all expectations and then some.  Michael's voice will touch every emotion and fiber in your body, and at the same time bring a tear to your eye.  Michael Ball has an extraordinary gift and he shares it with his fans and friends---you couldn't ask for anything more, gotta love it!
Total Time: 90 minutes ~ Hip-O/Universal 088-111-992-9 ~ (2002)",1042934400,16,1547,4.911877394636015
1072673,5,6305791848,"I too was concerned upon hearing some of the audio/movement differences, but upon watching my DVD I found few problems.  This DVD is so clear that you nearly feal you are at the concert.  With a big screen TV, it is esp. good.  This voice is truly golden and even if there is a song not your favorite, the rest is worth it all.  Buy and enjoy this very much.  We can only hope that all of his videos will now be released on DVDs.  I am very anxiously awaiting a new concert album this year.
In a nutshell...buy, buy, and enjoy.",1041897600,3,527,4.117647058823529
1072674,4,6305791848,"I was about to return this DVD to the store due to synchronization problem but thanks to viewer w. of sunset's review, I adjusted the audio by switching to audio #2 on remote and all is well. Thanks so much for the tip! Why didn't the manufacturer put this same tip on their packaging! Can't believe they didn't notice it! Now, I'm able to enjoy Michael Ball's wonderful concert the way I was hoping to! My only reservation lies with the material. While it's all presented extremely well, I would have really have loved more theatre pieces since that's how we became fans of Mr. Ball. Nevertheless, it's still an excellent concert and very energetic and of course, the voice makes even filler like the ""Friends"" theme sound better than it is. And don't forget to adjust the audio on your remote!",1041206400,2,795,4.605633802816901
1072675,5,6305791848,"First I have to say that I was relieved to read the review that talks about the sound delay.  Hitting audio worked and it made watching this dvd so much better.  Not that it's a difficult thing to watch Michael Ball!  I've liked Michael Ball for a while, but recently received this dvd as a gift.  It's always amazing to watch Michael perform Gethsemane - his power and passion are chilling. I had never heard the James Bond theme of ""We Have All The Time In The World / Millennium"" and I absolutely love it!!!  The songs are beautiful and watching Michael sing them is even better!  ""Oh What A Circus!"" is fabulous and he depicts Che' perfectly with just the right sarcasm (as my mother pointed out to me! - who, by the way, has become a BIG Michael Ball fan since I've driven her nuts with everything Michael!).  And then, of course, there is the ""Blues Brothers Medley"" and ""Help Yourself"" - OH MY! I could watch him shake his tail feather all night!  Finishing with ""Love Changes Everything"" was very touching and an appropriate song to sum up the whole experience.  Michael just keeps proving that not only does he have a fabulous voice, but an amazing stage presence and sense of humor.",1040947200,7,1192,4.481481481481482
1072676,2,6305791848,"I was glad to see that I was not the first to see this, the video and audio is way out of sync.  Making a PAL format video into NTSC which is our format in the USA is very difficult.  The software that HIPO people used was very crude at best.  I have had better results at home.  If I was not a huge fan of Mr. Ball I would return the product.  My rating does not reflect the performance but the product that this company produced.  As for the concert it is great and Mr. Ball is very good.  I am a big fan of his, but this product will do nothing to enhance his image in the USA.  IMHO this company should pull the product and refund customers.",1039564800,,645,3.9076923076923076
1072677,5,6305791848,"To get the sounds to line up with his mouth, you have to go into the Audio options and choose the one that isn'st chosen, and then they should line up.
It's like that on all of them.",1039564800,5,182,3.8157894736842106
1072678,5,6305791848,"Finally Michael Ball's concert at Royal Albert Hall DVD is released here in US. Among all of Michael's concert videos, this concert, being one of his UK tours in 1999, is the best to represent his talent: singing from musicals to pop ballads and to rock'n rolls, composing, as well as acting. Most of the pop songs are carefully chosen from Michael's albums ""The Movies"", ""First Love"", etc., with the addition of some musical numbers that Michael gave his soulful rendering, among them ""Gethsemane"", ""Love Changes Everything"", and ""Empty Chairs Empty Tables"", are still and probably will always be the best that's ever been done.

By just listening to Michael's CDs, you'll be missing something very special, which are his emotion expressions, his lively stage presence, and his performance of rock'n roll songs. To all the joys that his voice has brought, his live performance in concert adds another dimension. Michael's concert is always ended with a string of rock'n roll songs, where his powerful high baritone enriches the tunes wonderfully. It always is quite an experience, energetic, hot, and fun fun fun. This concert is with no exception as Michael electrified the show with seven up-tempo songs in a row, and the last one, ""Help Yourself"" (not included in the CD along with ""How Can I Be Sure"") is most entertaining and fun to watch.
Indeed was Michael at his very best in this concert. You'll be totally thrilled by the voice, the singing, and the dancing, and of course, his smiles and his charms.",1038787200,,1511,4.90234375
1072679,5,6305791848,"I have all but one of Michael Ball's videos, purchased most from England.  All are outstanding...his talent never ends, acting, singing, interviews, etc.  A very warm, friendly person who loves fans as much as they love him!  Sings from his heart, and never disappoints his audience.  If you love really good music, and theater, don't miss The Best of Michael Ball and any others that come available -- hopefully soon!  I have all of his CDs, and  never tire of the variety of style he has mastered with the wide range of his powerful voice, from smokey sounds to rock and roll,and the best of musical theater.",977097600,10,610,4.654205607476635
7894819,5,6305791848,E njoyed  the DVD very much. Lived up to my expectations,1498003200,,56,4.090909090909091
7894820,5,6305791848,Always loved Michael's singing. Amazing since he has no formal training. This selection is easy listening and correlates with the cd of the same title. Michael connects with the audience emotionally and has a soothing quality. Enjoy!,1476489600,,233,5.324324324324325
7894821,5,6305791848,"Michael Ball always has a great performance. His voice is strong and expressions powerful. His ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" truly made me cry. It's also amazing seeing him adjusting himself for the emotions of different songs.",1445212800,,228,5.1891891891891895
7894822,4,6305791848,"Having watched the Les Miz 10th anniversary DVD (which is fabulous), and Michael Ball at the Donmar (which was a brave, raw spellbinding performance), I wanted to catch up with this one from 1999.  I just purchased the DVD, and unfortunately, the audio IS out of sync slightly with the video as others have mentioned on this forum.  Nonetheless, I got to see the Michael Ball solo concert performance with full orchestra, back up singers and adoring audience.  He could just stand there and sing for two hours and I would have been happy, but here you get to see the playful Michael who works the audience like a masterful conductor.  This is not to say he's disingenuous -- not at all!  You really get the feeling he's enjoying himself immensely.  I wasn't too keen on some of the song choices, but other than his signature ""Love Changes Everything,"" watch out for his own composition (with Brian Kennedy) ""Someone Else's Dream,"" and probably the best cover of Tom Jones' ""Help Yourself"" that I've ever seen.  Well worth watching again and again.  Just be aware that even a new version of this DVD could still be out of sync.",1369526400,2,1126,4.651515151515151
7894823,5,6305791848,"Purchased this DVD and have to tell you, it was the BEST purchased I ever made....Being such a huge fan of Michael Ball and his talent, I was not disappointed at all... This DVD is entertaining from beginning to the end....some of my favorites include: Something so strong, Oh! what a circus, We have all the time in the world/Millennium, let the river run, Help yourself....Well worth the money I paid for it....If your a Michael Ball fan or if you simply want to hear someone with a great voice and lots of talent, this DVD is the one.........five stars all the way !!!!.............",1335571200,3,585,4.634615384615385
7894824,5,6305791848,"If you are a Michael Ball fan, this DVD has everything. A full orchestra and a variety of song selections. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it.",1246320000,,142,4.5
7894825,5,6305791848,"The only other pop/Broadway star I collect is Michael Feinstein who has a totally different style than Michael but both men have wonderful voices and a sense for what is right for them in performance.  Michael Ball is really quite fantastic in everything he does.  He is the only performer that I've collected all his recordings except for Placido Domingo, tenor, and Dmitri Hvorostovsky, baritone.  Why?  Because of the talent, folks!  They are all totally different but have one thing in common, great voices, different genres, of course.  Ball can sell a song in English like Domingo does in any language and Dmitri in Russian.  I enjoy this DVD as the only full concert available in USA on DVD.  I have all the others as well but if I want to curl up and enjoy each and every song and feel uplifted from a mood and relax, I really enjoy putting this on for a spin.  ""Empty Chairs and Empty Tables"" is one of my favorites and no one can sing it better than Michael Ball.  The 50th of ALW has been mentioned and it too is a wonderful concert with Ball showing up everyone, including my favorite soprano, Kiri Te Kanawa.  Both are recommended but if you really want to enjoy all these songs sung by a master, buy this DVD.  The backup singers, orchestration are also excellent.  My main passion is opera but only Ball can take me away from it for diversion and heartfelt emotion.",1163462400,4,1380,4.516129032258065
7894826,5,6305791848,This was a great movie.  Easy to find and very good quality!,1137110400,2,60,4.0
7894827,2,6305791848,"I have fallen in love with Michael Ball through his impressive works on Broadway and his stand out performances in ""Aspects of Love"", ""Les Miserables"", and ""Phantom Of The Opera."" No matter what show he does he always seems to get the show done annoyingly perfect. I only regret that he does not do more Broadway- choosing like so many actors these days to live off London's West End.

I own more than half his C.Ds and tons of merchandise- including the Michael Ball calendar- I did NOT hesitate to buy this DVD when I heard of it's release. Having never seen Michael perform in person I had always been eager to see him on stage.

Sadly this DVD disappointed... Michael Ball however passionate about the songs he choose did not choose the right ones- Questionable choices are what ruin this DVD/Show ""Friends Theme"" and ""Hot Stuff"" no matter how well sung are a real dissappointment to fans of Michael's Broadway stuff.

And even the Broadway songs are hardly Michael at his best...

""Love Changes Everything"" the song that truly started it all is left for the finale and sung without the passion you see at Webber's 50th Birthday Bash DVD or on the soundtrack for the show and is really dissappointing. ""Gestheme"" and Michaels Song-""Someone Elses Dream"" manage to stand out... by are not enough to make up for poor choices, and lack luster performances.

Even the most fanatically Michael Ball fan cannot help but, be dissappointed. If your looking for a great Michael Ball- performance definately buy ""Andrew Llyodd Webbe's 50th Bash"" there are some profound performances on that DVD and Michael is FANTASTIC! Definately spend your money on that and forget about this poor reprensentation of Michael- because fellow fans it's just not his best!",1133481600,8,1748,4.852348993288591
7894828,2,6305791848,"I purchases the DVD because I had heard the last song in a WETA program some time ago. I had tuned in as the program ended. I was so impressed that I wanted to hear the entire program- hence my purchase from Amazon. Unfortunately the sound track was so poor that I had to continually adjust the volume. I suspect the problem was in the reproduction of the DVDs.
