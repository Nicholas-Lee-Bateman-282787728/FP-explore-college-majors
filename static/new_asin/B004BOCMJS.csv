8422102,4,B004BOCMJS,"CZW's Pyramid of Hell is a average indie but, it does have 3 stand out matches
This was super early CZW when they were gaining massive attention from a almost bankrupt ECW  fan base
Both CZW and XPW delivered in straight up deathmatch style matches more so then in the 7 years the real ECW was open

The late Trent Acid vs Wifebeater (is a interesting must see)

Justice Pain vs White Lotus in the  CZW Iron Man Title Best 2/3 Falls Match is really good

CZW Tag Team Title Match in the Pyramid of Hell deathmatch
Nick Gage & Zandig vs  Lobo & Ric Blade  is brutal  (For a indie company at this time 1999 this was a love letter to early 90's FMW and W*ING)
It's a real must see this is the type of match ECW fans were never given (Mostly due to the various State athletic commissions and Paul E Dangerously being to cheap to pay these people off under the table to look the other way)
