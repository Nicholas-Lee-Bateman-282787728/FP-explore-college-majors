It's a perfect starting point for anyone interested in Qi gong and its health benefits, as well as more advanced students. What's unique about this Qi gong form is that it weaves in the immense transformative power of the age-old chakra system of traditional Indian medicine.

First there's a set of highly effective Qigong warm-ups. Then, each chakra's dance is its own chapter on the DVD so it is easy to locate and repeat if desired. It's even great if you just have a few minutes in the morning or on your break to do just a few moves.

Let me tell you I cannot believe the amount of energy I have gained after just a few days of doing this dance of release! I jump out of bed refreshed after only 6 hours of sleep where before 9 hours wouldn't do it! My hands and feet are warmer too, my breathing is naturally deeper, and I just don't get into the same old boring minor conflicts with others.

The video was shot in the Great Smoky Mountains giving a glorious backdrop to your workout. The music for the flowing dances is awesome.

I would definitely recommend this video to people of all ages wishing to improve their health and energy level, or wanting to let go of painful episodes in their past. This teacher, who studied under a Beijing Qi Gong master for 3 years, has a serenity, intense dedication and loving energy that is hard to find these days! Well worth your money. Enjoy!",1232409600,,1482,4.477777777777778
8309744,5,B001HW32KU,"A friend suggested this Qi Gong instructional video, and I am so glad she did! Using the Amazon search tool, I never would have found this amazing dvd among the hundreds of other Tai Chi/Qi Gong offerings.
What makes this one so different and useful is the very gifted teacher Laura Martin. She has a patient,clear and kind manner, which she employs to teach us these precious movements.
As explained in the opening remarks, Laura was commissioned to develop this special sequence of movements to help us free ourselves of painful emotional memories that our bodies hold on to. By stimulating and opening these seven energy centers (or chakras) in our bodies we can free ourselves of these old emotional wounds.
Laura skillfully demonstrates and explains each movement and then repeats it in silence. I found this a particularly effective way to learn each step. Once we learn each movement (associated with each chakra) we are encouraged to create our own unique dance of healing and freedom.
Laura also teaches us a very useful and creative warm up routine. I found the opening stretches and movements very relaxing and helpful on their own!
After all the instruction is complete, Laura and her friend Lady Cerelli take is to a beautiful open field where they perform this Qi Gong dance for us. Without even getting up off the couch I am feeling great benefit in watching these beautiful Qi Gong movements!
I dearly hope this is the first of many such instructional DVDs from Ms. Martin. I strongly encourage you to buy the video for yourself and start on a path to healing and happiness through Qi Gong.",1228608000,,1606,4.8014440433212995
