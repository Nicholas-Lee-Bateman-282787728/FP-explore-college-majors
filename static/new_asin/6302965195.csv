8010177,5,6302965195,I enjoyed this DVD very much. It brought back memories of my childhood watching Abbott&Costello on TV. The DVD had the shows just like they were on TV. I plan on getting all the volumes.,1155340800,,186,4.3428571428571425
8010178,5,6302965195,"I love the Abbott & Costello Show.  They are much better in front of an audience than in their Universal films.

Note that this Amazon page incorrectly credits Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera for directing the 1950s A&C show.  They did not.  Someone at Amazon is confusing these B&W sitcoms with the 1967 cartoon shorts from Hanan-Barbera that featured Bud Abbott doing his own voice (Lou Costello died in 1960).",1109116800,,407,4.771428571428571
8010179,5,6302965195,"These shows have never looked better! When first shown on television most stations ran 16mm prints. Now we can enjoy these from their pristine 35mm masters! Since the first season was way better than the second, both seaseons are being included on all DVDs (fewer people would buy the second season).  The first season boasts some of the only filmed copies of their vaudeville routines, the story was only an excuse for the boys to go somewhere for the routines to happen. The second season was more story driven (they had used up their routines).
The only negative thing about these DVDs is the cost! Some shows sell entire seasons for the price of four Abbott & Costello shows.
This meager offering is:
#1 ""Lou Falls for Ruby"" (aka The Pigeon) from the second season, Lou falls for a gangster's girlfriend.
#2 ""Hillary's Father"" (aka The Music Lovers) from the first season, Lou tries to learn to sing to impress Hillary's Father.
#3 ""Uncle Ruppert"" (aka Uncle from New Jersey) from the second season, Lou fakes a rich uncle to avoid being evicted.
#4 ""Bingo's Troubles"" (aka Bingo) from the first season, Lou needs to get their pet chimp a license, but Lou geta s marriage liscense.",1044057600,,1185,4.72463768115942
