Funny...seems there was more entertainment back then than there is now......These were the types of movies that would show, usually on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon..and if the weather was bad outside that's where we were...inside watching movies.  This movie shows the old frontier.....how it was BEFORE we were bombarded with technology.  Watch this plus the other wildneress types of movies with an open mind..you won't be disappointed! And if you really look......technicolor is still the best!!!!!",1246060800,5,616,5.079207920792079
