8265532,3,B0017BW89W,"This is a case of buyer beware.  The DVD looks like it was copied from a videocassette, which in turn was copied from broadcast.  The sound and picture are okay, but the quality is not up to cable or DVD standards.  Still, the cartoon (so-so quality and all) is just like I remember, when I had to tune the old black and white to the local UHF channel after school to catch Hoppity.  There are no DVD chapters- once you select play, the DVD goes into a continuous loop.  (I fell asleep and woke up to an earlier episode.)  For some reason an awful cartoon about a young burro is included.  For the price, it's okay but I would rather pay a little more for the entire series done in better quality.",1255910400,,697,4.234848484848484
