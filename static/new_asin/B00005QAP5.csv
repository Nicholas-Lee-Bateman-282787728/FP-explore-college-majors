7950328,1,B00005QAP5,Is it possible for a movie to blow and suck at the same time? ( One star is VERY generous! maybe for Bree Turner. ),1388361600,,115,3.64
7950329,3,B00005QAP5,"This was actually a good movie. Not only was it a good movie over all, but the stories within the movie was good. I was expecting a wrestling movie--period. I got much more. I would actually  give this movie a 3.5 stars if I could. This movie was about wrestling, ambition, love, friendship. I have seen this story a thousand times, but never with wrestling's violence as the backdrop. Any fan of pro wrestling and UFC fighting will love this movie. Aside from all the different stories, there is plenty of action for us wrestling fans. I do not understand the bad reviews. But the stories within the story will attract more than wrestling/UFC fans. Can't wait for the sequel.",1128556800,,676,4.633333333333334
7950330,1,B00005QAP5,"It's nice that they decided to do a wrestling movie, and I admit I wanted to watch this because it just reeked with the cheese factor.  Unfortunatly that was not the case here.  Instead what we have is a fairly seriouse attempt at a sport movie.
Backyard DOgs is basically about two college students who are in to the backyard wrestling circuit.  THey hire this blond chick who is in financal trouble because she once owned a porno sight that accidently featured a minor.  So with her cameraman the four of them create this drama around the two wrestlers as tehy travel in the Backyard wrestling circuit in hopes of one day entering into the FWE, or japanese circuit.  Along the way they end up in this violent rivalry (think chief villian) with a man called Voodoo who is this 300lb black man that seems to randomly show up at their matches.  Along the way sexual tension rises as does tempers which leads to a match between the two main characters, however in the end they fullfill their dream and enter into the Japanese circuit.
This movie is terrible.  THe whole idea of an organized backyard wrestling circuit that is similar to the territories of the pro leage in the early days is silly (although probably true) and the fact that this huge guy is basically interfering all the time is like a bad WCW storyline (and that is really bad).
Overall skip out on this title, there is so much more out there that is better.  Instead of this watch one of these titles instead.
1: No Holds Barred (VHS only)
2: Kickboxer
3: Bloodsport
4: Rocky
Those are so much better",1051056000,2,1566,4.508833922261484
7950331,5,B00005QAP5,"I just recently rented Backyard Dogs and at first thought I would hate it but as it first started I Found myself enjoying every minute of it. It had every thing that makes a bad movie good Action, Sex, And A helluva lot of Great Wrestling Action. In my honest opinion I would like that Today's Backyard Wrestling is far more superior than what the lame WWE could ever come up with. I Recommend this film to any true Backyard Wrestling Fan",1041552000,,438,4.353658536585366
7950332,1,B00005QAP5,"This is the worst DVD i have ever had the misfortune of viewing, I am embarassed to say i own it.  i loved the best of backyard wrestling series, I love wrestling, I love wrestling related movies, but this is just plain bad.  The storyline makes NO sence, the acting is terrible, this is actually a MOVIE, like a feature film, not anything to do with real backyard wrestling... and it's TERRIBLE.  PLEASE do not buy it!!",1019433600,7,420,4.428571428571429
