5622596,5,B00BI6A56E,"This is a beautifully shot, unbiased film that discusses the major sources of our energy today. I found the material fascinating and highly educational. The approach is not overly technical and allows the viewer to come away with a much deeper understanding of our current energy needs and the challenges we face looking forward.",1362614400,10,329,5.111111111111111
5622597,5,B00BI6A56E,"As someone who works in this field, I can tell you that nearly all the media I see on energy is unreliable -- most of it too left, some of it too right, all of it not very well informed. This is the first documentary that gets it right. It's practical, realistic, objective and scientifically based, while at the same time fast moving and entertaining. I don't agree with everything in it, because it doesn't favor any one industry (and I'm biased toward mine -- I admit it). But if you want a true picture of what it will require to power the world as we move into the 21st century, this is the best you'll find.",1362614400,17,613,4.247863247863248
5622598,5,B00BI6A56E,"Definitely learned a lot about the world of energy. There are a lot of challenges I did not recognize or even consider. I think this is a great film for anyone interested in energy or using power (which you probably are by reading this on your computer). So basically, we should all watch this film and make sure we understand the energy issues we are living with.",1362528000,,364,4.447761194029851
5622599,5,B00BI6A56E,"Energy is a hugely complicated subject with lots of pros and cons - this film features a lot of global energy experts and beautifully-shot scenes from around the world. If we're going to have a smart energy future, discussions like the one presented in Switch need to be happening in a logical and inclusive way. Highly recommended.",1362528000,3,332,4.842105263157895
5622600,5,B00BI6A56E,"Great documentary! This is type of energy film we've all be waiting for. By avoiding the sensationalism typically seen in other environmental documentaries, ""Switch"" gives the viewer the real facts about energy and practical steps we can all take for a smarter, more sustainable future.",1362528000,,286,5.377777777777778
5622621,5,B00BI6A56E,"In a society that tends to take energy resources for granted, this film provides an appreciation for the energy resources we have and challenges facing those we would like to develop. Switch provides a scientific analysis of global energy production in an accessible and engaging format. The film does an admirable job covering traditional and novel energy resources, presenting these as a combination of on-site ""how does it work"" vignettes coupled with articulate insights from knowledgeable experts. Although its focus on energy naturally involves environmental concerns, the film aims to inform viewers, outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each energy resource and provide a sense of scale with respect to the demands of an energy-hungry society.",1424736000,,756,5.525862068965517
5622622,5,B00BI6A56E,"Good, well balanced video.  My guess is those who claim it is biased are people who wanted it to be a green energy cheer leading video.  I found it to be a very scientific look and how we use energy",1424304000,,198,3.925
5622623,1,B00BI6A56E,"Poor spoken audio quality (too much background noise) and no subtitles available.

5622625,5,B00BI6A56E,"This visually stunning film gave me a new perspective on energy, from all sides.  Its authentic, informative, yet entertaining style contrasts starkly with the propaganda that call themselves ""documentaries"" from both ends of the spectrum.  I am a teacher, and it's been a valuable resource for my class. I not only use the information from the film, but I also use it to show the difference between hype and drama-conjuring compared to well-researched and expert-documented material.  The film also is associated with a website with amazing educational material and more interviews, etc. that didn't make it into the full film.  That's been an excellent find.  I really appreciate that the film captures the people who work in the energy industry, in all sorts of roles, all over the world.  Plus, Dr. Tinker is an excellent host.  I highly recommend that you check out the film.  You'll be a better world citizen (and more interesting person) for it!",1423094400,,952,5.019108280254777

5622629,5,B00BI6A56E,"I have used the Switch video and web site in my Energy IQ colloquia class for the last two years.
The students really enjoy the short videos on the wide variety of topics.
What I appreciate is that web site is not preachy, but factual.
The goal of the Switch Energy Project is to educate the general population so they can make better decisions.
I find it refreshing to have a resource that presents information and lets you make your own decisions.

5622630,5,B00BI6A56E,"Learning about how we produce, distribute, and use energy is very important for all of us. Maybe one of the most important things for us to understand.

The way we produce and use energy for all of our activities like energy for our homes, jobs, and transportation is directly related to human caused climate change. It is not sustainable.

We must figure out and actually change the way we produce and use energy so that we can achieve a sustainable human existence on this planet.

The Switch Documentary is excellent for learning about energy. It is done beautifully and Scott Tinker is a great message transmitter.

Please also go to www.switchenergyproject.com and learn how you can manage your energy use so that it is sustainable.",1423008000,,737,4.872
5622661,5,B00BI6A56E,This is a movie that I watch over and over again in my classroom.  It has really made a positive impact on my students and has made them think about energy use and its production and how they can do something to make less of a carbon footprint in their own lifetimes.  It's also made me think a lot about what I do as a consumer and how I can improve my habits to be better in tune with the world.  I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in knowing more about energy and the need to switch the direction of our use.,1423008000,,526,4.038461538461538

5622663,5,B00BI6A56E,"I teach AP Environmental Science in an urban district in North Carolina. It is often difficult to get my urban students to connect with alternative energy sources or to understand what happens in other countries. Switch was an invaluable resource for my class. I use it to introduce alternative energy and I refer to it constantly afterwards.  The students really enjoyed it, as well.

All around, I can recommend this for a science class, or for anyone sitting at home wishing they knew more about alternative energy!",1423008000,,518,4.942528735632184
5622664,5,B00BI6A56E,"Chula Vista Public Library selected ""Switch"" to open up the topic of energy conservation and changing ""use"" habits to our community.  The DVD clips along at a good pace - the chapters transition nicely and best of all - no topic gets too ""bogged down"" by a boffin in a white coat - which is the kiss of death (imo) if you want to keep the general public engaged.  We were pleasantly surprised that our audience of all ages stayed and watched the DVD from beginning to end in our library auditorium on a Saturday afternoon. It's a scenic, vivid production and the narration is never too technical for Joe Public to understand, without being childish either.  We also posted the link to the Switch website on our own website and heard that people found this useful. I imagine this DVD would help stimulate classroom discussions and would be a useful item to add to a library collection catering to middle school and older audiences.",1423008000,,930,4.624242424242424
5622665,5,B00BI6A56E,"Switch - the movie- is useful in multiple venues in which I teach about energy resources and energy prospects for the future.  I use it to train teachers and students about renewables versus non-renewables; conservation; environmental impacts.  I give the teachers I train a copy for themselves and send them to the web site, which has even MORE resources.  Everyone in this country needs to see this movie, to become energy literate.",1423008000,,434,5.0
5622666,5,B00BI6A56E,"I attended one of the viewing parties hosted by Dr. Tinker and over the years had heard him speak to a number of groups.  I am in the oil and gas exploration business in Austin and thoroughly enjoyed his factual approach to energy problems without a political agenda.  This movie is extremely entertaining and informative.  All of his research and dedication to education is the correct way to approach energy conservation, evaluation of alternatives and approaching energy for the future with knowledge not unfounded opinion or political agenda.",1423008000,,546,5.181818181818182
5622667,5,B00BI6A56E,"I saw this documentary on the energy industry years ago at SMU in Dallas and have since purchased the DVD.  The audience was comprised of liberals and conservatives alike with various views on the industry.

The film was truly eye-opening and did not offend either side.  This is the one source I would point those that want an unbiased account of where our country is with regard to energy and should be mandatory viewing for ALL politicians.

It would be nice if our leaders were armed with facts for once in their lives, our country would be the true winner.",1423008000,,561,4.58
5622668,5,B00BI6A56E,"If you want a comprehensive, unbiased summary of where we stand in regards to energy policy today and what we need to do to ensure we have enough to power our needs for tomorrow, this is THE documentary for you.  Nothing technical here, very entertaining and as appropriate for elementary schools as for colleges.  After viewing this film you will know more about energy than 99% of the populace.  A shame no network or cable station will touch it--it's not controversial enough!",1423008000,,479,4.817073170731708
5622669,5,B00BI6A56E,"Switch conveys the breadth of potential energy sources, and examines the respective technologies in harnessing each energy source, along with the pros/cons of their scale and challenges in implementation. It will appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers, from the technical to non-technical, from the politically engaged to the apolitical.  Important background for the entire public these days.",1423008000,,392,5.758620689655173
5622670,5,B00BI6A56E,"I bought this DVD over a year ago. I've watched it several times. If you want to get a handle on the energy situation across the planet this is the film to watch. Hydropower, coal, oil, gas, wind, solar PV and thermal and finally nuclear power are all reviewed. Dr. Scott Tinker Introduces the useful term ""How many people does a facility power"". This is a very informative and eye opening DVD. Buy two copies, Keep one for yourself, lone the other out. This information needs to go viral. I haven't gotten too deep into the website but it looks to be very good.",1423008000,,562,4.413461538461538
5622701,2,B00BI6A56E,"Switch -- while seemingly well intentioned -- is a mere surface review of the carbon crisis and like a lot of documentaries, pushes for the same old, flawed nuclear fission that we don't need and can't afford. There are much better documentaries on the energy and environment and I'd suggest one of those instead.",1423008000,2,313,4.814814814814815
5622702,5,B00BI6A56E,Lots to be learned from this film. Seems unbiased and draws reasonable conclusion at the end. I think everyone should watch this documentary.,1423008000,,141,5.173913043478261
5622703,5,B00BI6A56E,"Switch is the only energy movie I recommend to my Family, Friends, and colleagues.  There are several ""energy documentaries"" that wrap big tar balls of hyperbole and misdirection around kernels of truth.  Their only purpose is to incite people of one political stripe or another.  Much of their hyperbole is inaccurate and misleading.  They are not, in my opinion, worth watching.

Switch has done a remarkable job of addressing the energy mix in a factual and insightful manner with the intent of educating its viewers rather than enraging them.  Everyone in the US if not the world should watch this documentary with their friends and neighbors, and then have dispassionate - educated conversations about the energy we use today and what our energy mix may look like in the future.

I would encourage Dr. Tinker and the Switch Energy team to consider a sequel - updating his data and building off of the research they have done since this movie was filmed.",1423008000,,958,4.8765432098765435
5622704,5,B00BI6A56E,Switch covers the energy map like no other video.  I've been using it as a teaching tool for the past three years.  The video combines high production values with smart dialogue and salient interviews with energy practitioners.  I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wishes to better understand the global energy landscape.,1423008000,,334,5.264150943396227
5622705,5,B00BI6A56E,"This video is the single most useful tool I have found for teaching energy concepts to kids. I use it for middle schoolers all the way through to AP students. It is non-partisan and explains things very clearly. ALL of the material is of very high quality! It is one of the few movies worth showing in all the way through during class!! The discussions coming from the class are wonderful, and the kids really get energy after watching this video!
HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1423008000,,476,4.678571428571429
5622706,5,B00BI6A56E,"Great film on our energy needs; past, present and future.  This is a non-partison look at the world's energy usage and needs.  It is educational.

5622724,2,B00BI6A56E,"The documentary is just OK. Could have spent more time on battery energy storage, micro grid technologies. At least it helps elevate overall awareness of the challenges ahead for the utility grid.",1393718400,,196,5.15625
5622725,5,B00BI6A56E,"This is a very well balanced documentary that is both informative and entertaining. It takes a very balanced approach in taking a look at various energy alternatives, from fossil fuels to alternatives. It looks at common forms of energy, as well as some exotic ones. In the end, it dissects the state of the world's energy use and shows how there is no silver bullet to change things overnight. It discusses the problems and advantages of various forms of energy. It wraps up in about 10 minutes summarizing how each form of energy might play a role in coming decades so that we use less fossil fuel. It is not pie in the sky. It does not side with any particular view. It is a great educational piece.",1392336000,2,702,4.4921875

5622728,5,B00BI6A56E,"Well, it's not exactly unbiased, Scott Tinker emphasizes the importance of efficiency in dealing with energy issues. Other than that, this is an examination of the variety of energy sources available to accomplish the switch between a coal and oil-dominated sources to natural gas, nuclear, and renewable sources. Energy options are put int perspectives of both availability (you can't take advantage of tidal energy in Nebraska) and the scale of energy supplied by a typical installation. Consideration is also paid to what it will take to develop energy storage and new transmission to implement the new energy future.

5622743,5,B00BI6A56E,"The Switch Project thorougly analyzes the potential alternatives to solving the problem of future energy supplies: Natural gas must form a bridge between today's energy economy based on coal and the future dominance of nuclear power. The solar energies:hydropower, wind and PV have a place but it is relegated by natural limitations to a minor role, probably never more than 20% of our overall energy supply

Switch covers the world and all energy  alternatives. The project is not driven by ideology or financial interest except for the quest to find a truly sustainable energy supply. Sustainability requires Accessibility, Environmental Benefit and Social Acceptance. Natural gas best meets these needs now, but for the long term (many hundreds or even thousands of year) nuclear power is the only truly sustainable energy technology.

My only objection to the Switch analysis is that it gives natural gas a slight edge over nuclear power in terms of safety. It may be that nuclear power is not ""percieved"" to be safer than the use of natural gas, but the facts are that there is no enegy alternative safer than nuclear power. There have been three major accidents involving nuclear power reactors: Three Mile Island, Chernoybyl and Fukashima, with actual death tolls of ""0"", ""64""(UNCEAR), and ""0"", respectively. The calculation of thousands of hypothetical deaths based on the linear-no-threashold (LNT) theory of radiation effects have not been and cannot be verified by actual evidence of mortality due to radiation. The truth of this position need not even be debated today because its turth will ultimately b a matter of record in the future.

The Switch Project  should be held as a benchmark to compare future energy developments. It is for this reason that I gave it my highest recommendation.",1382227200,,1804,5.143344709897611
5622744,5,B00BI6A56E,Scenic and entertaining enough for a serious documentary.  I expect most partisans  who watch this  might feel that their favored technologies should have had additional good points extolled and that more flaws of the technologies they oppose should have been highlighted.  But overall it is pretty even handed and provides great background information for evaluations of  our energy future.,1381622400,,391,5.559322033898305
5622745,5,B00BI6A56E,Very good information that surprises almost everyone regarding the amount of energy we consume.

5622746,5,B00BI6A56E,"This is a well written and well produced short film on the worlds energy sources.  It does point out how hard it is to find alternatives to oil.

Scott gives a balanced treatment of unconventional gas, wind, solar, bio fuels, and nuclear options and shows the limitations and environmental impact of each of them.

The film discusses the impact of our expected increases in efficiency, but does not include the impact of additional efficiency gains that could be made or their potential environmental impact.  It also does not discuss the nuclear disposal decision by the US (President Ford) vs. the French decision to recycle and reuse their waste.  These two points are minor critiques of a very good overview  of the worlds energy options.

The students felt that is was very balanced and allowed them to make informed choices about energy.  I would recommend it at the beginning of the unit as an overview with a graphic organizer for students to fill in (how energy is obtained, its use, pros, cons) or at the end of the unit with a graphic organizer ""what we already learned vs. what was new"" (hopefully heavy on the 'what-we-learned' side).

I mean, this could have been a skit for Saturday Night Live it was so ridiculous. So much misinformation. So much left out information. Just breathtaking.

Most of the people of the world do not consume 20,000,000 watts of energy per year, as the narrator assumes as a rule of thumb. No one who lives on the continent of Africa consumes even half that much. For the narrator to use his personal usage as a globe-trotting, giant house living, electronic gadgets using engineer as a rule of thumb for everyone on the planet is just flabbergasting.

To not even consider reducing consumption is irresponsible. To not even address the fallacy that nature is merely a ""resource"" is sickening.

The crack about solar being an ""unreliable"" energy source almost made me choke. This part of New Mexico enjoys perfect sunny days 95% of the year. That's your idea of unreliable? There are huge parts of the world that get no rainfall ever. Just one square mile of land receives something like 12 trillion watt-hours per square mile per year! Your film suggests that the Andasol solar power station in Spain is down a significant part of the time due to inclement weather, when in fact it is not. California is building two huge solar gathering power plants in the Mojave. That's unreliable?

I could not stomach the nuclear power section and had to leave. There are so many reported nuclear power plant-related accidents every year, each one threatening containment, not waiting for a tornado, not needing a tornado to cause trouble. We still have not solved the permanent waste storage problem, no matter what is said at the end, which of course was heralded more than 20 years ago. If it is a real solution how come it didn't solve anything? To say nothing of the 100s of ore tailings piles we live with here.

The cost of coal is much higher than is reported if you also factor in the respiratory illness children suffer in the vicinity of coal-fired power plants, such as the 2 here in the Four Corners.

A load of crap from start to finish. Good thing you are losing the fight.",1369267200,7,2304,4.593673965936739
