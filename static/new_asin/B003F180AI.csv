8395790,4,B003F180AI,"BOWFINGER (1999) is an ""inside Hollywood"" comedy, scripted by and starring Steve Martin. It's the story of an unsuccessful producer/director who hatches a crazy scheme: to film an alien invasion sci-fier with a popular action star (Eddie Murphy), but Bobby Bowfinger has to do so without the actor knowing he's in the picture.

This is fairly easy to do because Kit Ramsey is a hyper-paranoid who's #1 fear is aliens. So while a camera secretly rolls, Bowfinger's actors accost Kit on the street, say their lines, and his terrified reactions are genuine. These weird encounters push Kit over an emotional cliff and he's force into seclusion. Now Bowfinger needs a lookalike and he finds one, a simpleton named ""Jiff,"" a dead ringer for Ramsey. Jiff's ambition is to be a go-fer, so Bowfinger hires him to both run for coffee and play non-dialogue in his budding fright film masterpiece, ""Chubby Rain.""

It's a crazy story of amateur thespians and a con man moviemaker who constantly fools people into doing his bidding, but the film also comments on the shallowness of the motion picture industry.

Directed by Frank Oz, this underappreciated farce also features Heather Graham, Jamie Kennedy, Christine Baranski, Barry Newman, Robert Downey Jr. (as a dismissive studio exec.) and Terence Stamp (as Kit's mental health guru). Definitely recommended!",1385683200,,1349,5.1506849315068495
