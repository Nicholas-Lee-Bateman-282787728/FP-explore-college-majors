7826002,5,6302477395,I remember this movie being shown on television in the late 1960's. I would actually like to watch it again and see if I enjoy it as much as I did back then. I remember 1 of the songs and I am sure I will notice things about this movie that I did not notice when I watched it as a little kid. But I do remember it was a fun movie to watch and I have often thought about it over the years and never forgot seeing it.,1430352000,,415,3.6741573033707864

7826004,1,6302477395,"Synopsis:  A little girl maned Red Riding Hood is being stalked by a wolf (in the worst wolf suit ever) and his skunk partner (voice by Flipper), who is enamored with Red's parrot.
Unfortunately, they both also sing.
This  is... gosh.  How does one describe badness of this level?  The wolf suit is  so poorly assembled he actually knocks his own nose off in one scene. The  woodsmen have a disturbing interest in a small little girl.  Scene  continuity appears to have been inspired by Ed Wood as people run from  late-night thunderstorms that strike in the middle of a clear day.  I have  told people about this movie and they don't believe me. I show it to them  as proof and they stop asking me for movie recommendations.  This movie is  so *bad* I loved every minute of it.
If you are like me and enjoy bad  films and are a fan of MST3K, then this is a must for your collection.  Otherwise, well, you're in for a shock.
Not that you won't be anyway.",956793600,11,954,4.3352272727272725
