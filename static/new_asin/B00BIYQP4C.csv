5624370,5,B00BIYQP4C,David Alexanian is a treasure and seemed to be the best match for what David Marley wanted for his dream of a documentary on his quest for Unity while revisiting his trip with his father when he was eleven. The documentary is a wonderful journey with Davids two brothers Rohan and Robbie. All Characters shown in this film are a wonderful incite to their lives and beliefs. I recommend this film to those interested in the lives of Bob Marley's sons it is a wonderful look into personal ideas and beliefs of the three brothers.,1404604800,,527,4.557894736842106
