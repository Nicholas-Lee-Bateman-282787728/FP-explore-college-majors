6297299,5,B00ITZXDDY,"It is now 3am in the morning and I am on my fifth (if not more) viewing of this movie!  The Hammer movies never fail to entertain and keep you glued to the screen.  In fact, I've never seen a bad Hammer film.  Why don't we have movie houses today who can make movies like this?

Ingrid Pitt shines in this movie, as she transforms from a frumpy old countess into a beautiful young, voluptuous woman with the help of virgins' blood!  Quite eery, but so well done in this film.  Unfortunately, Ingrid is not with us today, but her talents are so visible in this well-written, well-directed film.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie to lovers of vampire movies, or for those who wish to watch a well-written, well-acted horror movie.  This one WON'T DISAPPOINT!!",1399766400,26,754,4.533333333333333

6297302,5,B00ITZXDDY,"This is a great late night movie to have. It's one of Hammer's 1970's productions starring Ingrid Pitt, so it's a little after their heyday of the mid to late 60's. Still, it has all of the traditional Hammer Victorian style sets and costumes. Pitt plays an old widow who is in love with a young man. In order to win his love, she must bathe in the blood of Virgins each night to restore her youth. Yep, that's it. No blood sucking vampires here! I would definitely recommend this movie to any Hammer fan that has yet to see it.",1461715200,3,528,4.237623762376238

6297304,3,B00ITZXDDY,"""Countess Dracula""(1971) is directed by Peter Sasdy. This movie is loosely based on the life of serial killer Elizabeth Bathory(1560-1614). In the movie she regains her youth by soaking in the blood of virgins, but as this effect only lasts for so long she must continue to kill. The movie stars Ingrid Pitt, who also appeared in ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""The House That Dripped Blood"" and ""The Wicker Man"". This movie is good, if a bit pedestrian, however there is a bit of full frontal nudity with Ingrid Pitt that caught my attention. Overall this is a worthwhile addition to someone's Hammer horror collection.

The blu-ray has deep rich colours and blacks, but it's hard to say if this was actually remastered since a lot of dust particles exist on the image. Special features include audio commentary with Ingrid Pitt, and the director, as well as Jeremy Paul, and Jonathan Sothcott. There is also a featurette about the film career of Ingrid Pitt, and an archival audio interview with Ingrid Pitt.",1454716800,2,1000,4.847953216374269

6297321,4,B00ITZXDDY,"Based loosely on the life of Elizabeth Bathory, this movie is not as Horrific as it could have been.  Ingrid Pitt plays the lead roll of Countess Elisabeth Ndasdy.  Hammer films had a thing for hiring non British actresses and Actors  and then dubbing their dialog with more British sounding voices.  The movie is typical of all Hammer horror movies, they were never very scary or frighting. When you base the movie on a real life woman, who may have killed close to 600 young women in her quest for youth, this movie could have been much better and more dramatic and more scary.  I liked it, but I think it could have been so much better.",1412467200,2,639,4.427350427350428
6297322,5,B00ITZXDDY,"When one conjures up the name Ingrid Pitt, what comes to mind? Ahhh a female vampire, but not just an ordinary female vampire! She is by far the sexiest and best female vampire that ever graced the silver screen. I loved this movie and always will. Synapse has done a real good job on this edition. I think if Ingrid were alive to see it this way, she would have enjoyed it even more. The menu design is well done and the background music adds to the atmosphere. I used to own the midnight movies edition years ago, but I have to say this is an improvement over that for certain.
Not only do you get the movie, but you get these special features:

Countess Dracula Still Gallery with moving pictures and music

Immortal Countess: The Cinematic Life of Ingrid Pitt (although this is a nice bio featurette, it mainly focuses on her few major movie roles ""The Vampire Lovers"", ""Countess Dracula"", ""The House That Dripped Blood"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""The Wicker Man"" and talks about her very first appearance in the ""Sound of Horror"")

Archival Audio Interview with Ingrid Pitt, which is just wonderful.

6297323,3,B00ITZXDDY,"The movie is perhaps Hammer at their best, but the turn about on blu-ray is not.  I was not very pleased with the quality of the blu-ray.  I truly believe they could have done a better job.  It seemed like a very well produced dvd copy and not what I am used to on blu-ray.  There are others of Hammer film movies on blu-ray, and they have a excellent improvement in picture and sound.  Countess Dracula as a import(Which I also have) was a better copy on dvd.  Does this suggest that Foreign companies at better at improving the sound and picture on dvd, than Americans are with Blu-ray?
  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the special features and hearing Ingrid Pitt's life story.  It is still a pleasure having this movie especially because it is the first copy to be released on blu-ray but I hope in the future they will make a effort to improve on the picture and sound, and have the uncut version that was never released in theaters because I have seen it a long time ago when it was mistakenly released on Laser Disc and VHS, and I would love to have those versions too.  I think getting this on blu-ray was worth it, but it can still use a little more improvement.  Thank you and enjoy.",1408320000,3,1186,4.345454545454546

6297327,5,B00ITZXDDY,"Ive mentioned before that Im a big fan of Hammer Horror, and my fandom grows exponentially with each new title I watch.  I have to confess Ive only seen a handful of Hammer films, however Ive seen enough to know I love them.  And thanks to Synapse Films, fans like me can enjoy these timeless classics with digitally remastered sound and picture.  Their latest release, COUNTESS DRACULA, stars the lovely Ingrid Pitt and embodies everything Hammer Horror is renowned for.

Director Peter Sasdy directed a couple of other Hammer films, including TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA and HANDS OF THE RIPPER, as well as three episodes of the short-lived HAMMER HOUSE OF MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE television series.  As such, he was the perfect choice to bring this concept to the big screen.

COUNTESS DRACULA is shot well and has the same foreboding feel that made Hammer films so popular.  The acting is first rate with the afore mentioned Ingrid Pitt portraying the titular character.  She is accompanied onscreen by Sandor Eles, who portrays Lt. Toth, and Nigel Green as Captain Dobi.  Pitt steals the show, however, giving a magnificent performance as both a young woman and an old crone.

Theres not much gore or even blood in the film, which really surprises me given the premise.  However, the lack thereof is just fine; the intensity that is built up within the film doesnt need gore or blood to heighten it.  Thats not to say it wouldnt have been enjoyable to seebut with Hammer, the darkness comes from within the characters, not from splattering the walls with carnage.

I have not seen a previous copy of COUNTESS DRACULA, so I cannot say how much the picture and/or sound have improvedbut watching this film on Blu-ray is an excellent experience.  The picture is very clear, with no noticeable grainy images or blurred shots.  Likewise, the sound is exquisite, especially the ambient sounds that come through the surround-sound.  If you have the chance, do yourself a favor and watch this on Blu-ray.

COUNTESS DRACULA is a huge win for me, and I suggest fans of Gothic horror give it a look.  Even if you're not a fan of Hammer films already, this is the perfect movie to get you started.  It is available now.",1401148800,14,2208,4.748031496062992

6297329,5,B00ITZXDDY,"Synapse Films has released Director Peter Sasdy's  'COUNTESS DRACULA'-1972 in the Blu-Ray format and boy, does it look good. Posing at the time as part of Hammer Films Vampire series, it emerges as a cheat in that department for there is nary a fang in sight as the film is an historical take on the life of Countess Elisabeth Bathory with supernatural elements.  Hammer already did something similar back in 1966 with Director Don Sharp's 'RASPUTIN-THE MAD MONK' .  It also boasts the best performance by actress Ingrid Pitt transforming back and forth in aging makeup and a final performance by the great Nigel Green who passed away after the release of the film.  You will also see a young Leslie Anne Down included in the proceedings. Director Sasdy handles the historical antics with fervor coming off the excellent 'TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA' -1971  utilizing cinematographer Ken Talbot's images and hypnotic music score by Harry Robinson to great advantages.  MGM's Midnight Madness series had released this film on DVD in a double sided disc with Director Roy Ward Baker's 'THE VAMPIRE LOVERS'-1970 back in 2005 but the negative was a bit on the dark side.  Synapse has restored it in a gorgeous 1.66 -1080P transfer restoring the cuts made by 20th Century Fox for the US release to secure a PG rating which butchered it's co-feature 'VAMPIRE CIRCUS' even more.  This release is also packed with extras including  an Audio Commentary by actress Pitt, Director Sasdy and screenwriter Alexander Paal, a featurette on Pitt's career 'IMMORTAL COUNTESS' , an archival audio interview with Pitt, a lavish still gallery and an original British trailer.  If you didn't get the MGM DVD, you won't go wrong with the DVD included here which also looks excellent.  Synapse deserves kudos for this release  for its the best the film has looked since projected all those years ago.  It also immortalizes Ingrid Pitt who only lensed a few titles in her career but has had an incredible fan base over the years.  It's a shame she did not get to see this excellent transfer.  It is not one of Hammer's best but it shows what the studio could do when it ventured away from the Horror genre.  Highly  recommended.",1399939200,28,2203,4.832

8645462,4,B00ITZXDDY,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'Countess Dracula' released by Synapse Films in May, 2014.

This movie was released in 1971 by Hammer Productions.

Many people who are looking to purchase this will already have seen the movie. For those of you who haven't seen it, be aware that this is not a vampire movie. The title is very deceiving. See my comments below. Although deceiving, that does not mean that it is not a good movie. The plot device used, based on real events, remind me of the television series, 'The Twilight Zone.'

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: I am giving the picture 2 1/2 to 3 stars or average. The print is fairly sharp but I noticed 'noise' throughout. Especially the darker scenes. You see specks throughout but it isn't really  all that noticeable unless you are looking for it. I found that if I didn't pay attention to it then I didn't see it. But overall the picture is OK. It could be better but it is the best available at the time of this review in January, 2018.

There are some very good extra's. They include:

- A reversible sleeve for the Blu-Ray case.
- An audio commentary with the star of movie, Ingrid Pitt along with the director Peter Sasdy and the
screewriter Jeremy Paul and author Jonathan Sothcott. I have not listened to this as of the time of the
review.
- Featurette called 'Immortal Countess: The Cinematic Life of Ingrid Pitt' - This is a good short
documentary on the life of Ingrid Pitt. However, it's not very long.
- Archival audio Interview with Ingrid Pitt - This is not very clear but it's here for whatever that's worth.
- Still Gallery
- Theatrical Trailer

PLOT/SUMMARY: Count Nadasdy has died and the movie opens with the reading of his will. The Countess Nadasy has received almost half the estate with the other half being left to her daughter Ilona. Lt. Imre has been left his stables and horses and Grand Master Fabio has been left the library. Captain Dobi has been largely left out, receiving some armor. We learn that Dobi and the Countess have been lovers for quite some time.

One night, the Countess accidentally gets some blood from her servant girl on her. She notices that her skin has become younger. She kills the girl and uses her blood to appear to be a young woman. She has her daughter, who is out of the country and on her way to the castle, kidnapped. She tells Lt. Imre that she is Ilona and the two immediately fall in love. While together, the Countess ages and before Imre can notice she runs away. She conspires with Dobi to bring her another girl. Dobi is jealous and tells her that he likes her the way she was. However, he obeys her and brings her another girl. They plan on repeating this process indefinitely. A side effect of bathing in blood is that once it wears off, the Countess ages at a greater pace than is normal. Dobi, wanting to get Imre out of the picture after the Countess plans on marrying him, arranges to have him caught with a prostitute in the castle. After realizing that it was a setup, the Countess orders Dobi to bring her another girl. He brings her the prostitute but her blood has no effect on the Countess. They realize that she needs virgin blood. Knowing that she is limited in finding virgin girls whe continues with her romance and plans to marry Imre.

On the night before the wedding, the Countess orders Dobi to bring her a virgin. Dobi fetches her daughter Ilona and she is introduced to Dobi. Dobi finds out that he is really marrying the Countess. Ilona is kept locked in a tower and she asks Imre for help. He tells her that he will meet her the next day and help her get away. The day of the wedding, while Ilona is escaping she notices the wedding taking place. The Countess ages while taking her vows. She immediately heads after her next victim, her daughter Ilona!

PRODUCTION/COMMENTS: Despite the title, this is not a Dracula movie nor is it a female vampire movie or vampire movie at all. It is more of a fantasy, almost like a 'Twilight Zone' episode.  An elderly woman accidentally gets blood on her only to discover that it makes her appear younger for a short period of time. The more she applies blood, the older she appears after the effect wears off. This is very similar to the stuff Rod Serling was doing in the early 60's with the 'Twilight Zone' series. Throw in a historical setting and Hammer production values and you get 'Countess Dracula.' It is a story with a moral and I can think of several sayings that apply....'Beauty is the eye of the beholder,' 'Beauty is only skin deep' are a few.

'Countess Dracula' is based on true events. The Countess Nadasdy is based on the countess, Erzsebet Bathory. She had been married to the Count Nadasdy. She murdered over 300 women and as many as 650 with help of several co-conspirators. She really did bathe in their blood hoping to keep herself young. After being found guilty, she was confined to a few small rooms inside her castle with just slits for windows. She lived for several years and died there. Today she is considered to be the most prolific female killer in history. It surprises me that there have not been more movies based on her life. You would think her life would be prime material for horror movie producers and directors.

Amazingly, Ingrid Pitt's voice was dubbed. Her voice was actually perfect for the movie since the accent needed was natural to her being that she is from the area that the movie takes place. She was obviously unhappy about this along with the fact that the countess was not depicted as cruel enough for what she really was.

I felt like Hammer left this movie with an open ending even though it appears final. By not having the perpetrators executed they were, in my opinion, setting up a sequel in case of success. We are left with the Countess, Captain Dobi and her nurse in crime sitting in a jail cell. I can see a scenario where Captain Dobi attacks his jailers in order to give the Countess a chance to escape. But this movie was not a great financial success and a sequel was not meant to be.

This is considered one of the 'lesser' Hammer efforts. I don't think it is. Sure there is more 'court intrigue' than horror but that's OK. The story at least has some originality. Compared to some of the 'Dracula' movies, I prefer this. I felt like I was watching the same movie over and over again with the Dracula and Mummy movies. I thought this was very good the first time I watched it. Then I read about the negative reviews. I watched it again and liked it less so but I still liked it. I kind of agree with Pitt, that it could have used more violence.

This movie was originally intended to be a historical drama. Especially odd is that the true story, is much more bloody and violent than this movie. The real Countess had girls tortured and cut and grilled their skin and other body parts. Bathing in blood was just a part of all the atrocities that she was responsible for. 'Countess Dracula' was an epitaph added in later years. She is actually listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for murder.

RECOMMENDATIONS: This is recommended for all fans of Hammer Horror Productions and British horror. It is also recommended for fans of vampire movies but not without qualifying it first. This is not really a vampire movie. See comments above.

I'm giving this release 4 stars for the plot. I'm giving the picture 3 stars and the extra's 5 stars. Overall...4 stars.",1516320000,,7418,4.494432071269488

8645464,2,B00ITZXDDY,"Pretty dull Hammer take on the Countess Bathory legend starts off with Ingrid Pitt in unconvincing old age make-up playing Countess Elisabeth, who is already a pretty vile human being before she accidentally discovers that smearing the blood of young maidens across her wrinkled skin makes her young and beautiful.  Unfortunately for her (and the maidens who live in the nearby village) she finds the youth giving effects are only temporary and that she needs fresh blood or she becomes not only old again, but noticeably uglier than before.

In her young version, she masquerades as her own daughter, who was sent away when the girl was a small child.  Countess Elisabeth has her kidnapped by gypsies from a circus--although how the old woman happens to have contacts with gypsies who are simply passing through the village is never explained.  It's also not particularly plausible that a servant and an older man who was her lover for years would help her in her plan to procure and murder young women so she can marry a handsome young military officer who has inherited the horses, stables, and cottage on her dead husband's estate.

Having Countess Elisabeth evil from the get go makes her a pretty one-dimensional character.  If she had a conscience but was vain and couldn't resist the opportunity to be young that would have been a more interesting take on the character but Countess Dracula moves along at its own listless and mostly predictable pace--Countess Elisabeth gets old so quickly and needs so many victims it's inevitable she won't be able to maintain her charade for very long.

Of the early 1970's Hammer films that found the studio trying to insert a little flesh to go along with that bright red blood (Vampire Circus; Twins of Evil) this is easily the weakest of the bunch.  There's no suspense, no surprises and very little to keep most viewers interested, although Hammer die-hards will likely enjoy it anyway.  If nothing else Countess Dracula is better than Dracula AD 1972 and Scars of Dracula, but it's still a pretty crummy effort.",1497139200,,2062,4.885386819484241

the sound quality is very Good 2.0 master stereo mix much better than the old Mono sound

8645470,4,B00ITZXDDY,"Hammer loved them some vampires -- not only did they grace us with many stories about Christopher Lee's Dracula and the Karnstein trilogy, but with many miscellaneous tales of bloodsuckers.

So it isn't terribly surprising that they also tackled the story of the infamous Blood Countess, Erzs&eacute;bet Bathory, who famously used the blood of young girls as part of her beauty routine. And while this movie is properly Hammerized with a copious amount of boobs and a secret-identity story, it's a pretty compelling little fictional adaptation of the historical tale that never quite tips into conventional vampirism.

The cruel and aging Countess Elisabeth Nadasdy (Ingrid Pitt) has been ruling her lands with the help of her lover/steward Dobi (Nigel Green). When she throws a fit and causes a young chambermaid's face to bleed, she sees that the woman's blood has restored her face's youth -- so she kills the girl, bathes in her blood (offscreen), and has her teenage daughter Ilona (Lesley-Anne Down) kidnapped so she can pretend to be her. Why? For a guy, of course: her handsome new neighbor, Lt. Imre Toth (Sandor El&egrave;s).

Imre is immediately smitten by the beautiful countess, which delights her and displeases Dobi. But when the effect of the blood turns out to be temporary, Elisabeth desperately seeks out new victims in order to continue her affair with Imre, using her maid and Dobi to acquire them. But her ruse begins to fall apart faster than her face, as the bodies pile up faster than they can be hidden.

Obviously ""Countess Dracula"" uses the historical Bathory as a very loose foundation for their story -- the standards of 1971 cinema probably wouldn't allow a movie to depict the actual horrors and depravities of Bathory's life, and there are a lot of elements added like a single daughter (rather than her actual five-plus legitimate children) and a love triangle complicated by Elisabeth impersonating her own daughter.

That said, it's probably one of the best Hammer movies that the studio ever produced. It has some cheesy moments (obvious public reveal!) and plenty of naked breasts, but there's a sense that they tried to create a genuinely haunting historical thriller. Mentions of war with Turkey, hints of the occult, but without actually turning into a vampire story. Yes, this story called ""Countess Dracula"" has only a touch of the supernatural (the way Elisabeth's skin youthens when exposed to blood).

Furthermore, the sets and cinematography are more expansive and visually arresting than most of their movies (the slow dolly shot through the crystalline-decorated church), and it manages to throw in some rather shocking twists near the end. Perhaps the biggest flaw is the title, which is also the final line of the movie -- Vlad Tepes is a Romanian hero, so it seems unlikely they would use his nickname as an insult.

And the acting is also quite good, especially for a film where most of the characters are sociopathic, yet well-developed. Green gives the best performance as Dobi, a cruel and conniving man whose lifelong love for the Countess drives him to try to find a way to manipulate her out of her affair with Imre, and Pitt gives her best performance here as the seductive and shallow woman who can't cope with a life where all men don't desire her. Her Elisabeth is cruel and selfish and murderous, but not in a shallow, two-dimensional way.

""Countess Dracula"" has some cheesy moments, but these don't detract from the skilled, hauntingly creepy tale of a woman who will murder for beauty. Don't seek historical accuracy here, just an eerie semi-supernatural historical thriller.",1474243200,2,3642,5.008264462809917
