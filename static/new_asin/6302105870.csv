True, it is the greatest portrait of Chaplin as an artist, and for that reason alone the film is priceless, but for anyone who is a lover of cinema, this is a film whose every frame is saturated with love for not only it's subject, but for the craft of film itself. It is also essentail viewing for any fan of documentary and anyone who is interested in learning how to properly do justice to a subject in film. The film makers were of course lucky to have such a fascinating person to document, but the craft of the film is impeccable. The cinematography by Nestor Almendros, legendary DP for ""Days of Heaven"", is gorgeous but never slick. Richard Patterson's editing is so technicaly assured and artisticaly informed that the film flows with the ease and grace of a piece of music from the High Romantic period, think Mahler's Eighth Symphony. The narration, a chore shared by Walter Matthau, Jack Lemon and Laurence Olivier, is pitch perfect. And the use of Chaplin's own written music as the basis for the musical score for the film is a stroke of genius. Do not pass up the chance to see this film, you will love it.",1285113600,8,1205,4.506849315068493
436950,5,6302105870,"In 1975, filmmaker Richard Patterson produced a documentary on Charles Chaplin which
was the first such film that included scenes from later films including City Lights, Modern Times,
The Great Dictator, Verdoux, Limelight, etc.  It also contains footage of Chaplin from decades
worth of newsreels, home movies, the historic Oscar telecast from 1972 and footage taken of him
at his home in Vevey in 1974.  He is the only person who had full access to Charlie and Oona and
was able to film them at their home.  This loving tribute concludes with a final walk down the road as we see Chaplin, now using his cane as a real aid and his wife Oona walk down a grassy path. His final filmed trip down the road gives us comfort as he is not alone. Walter Matthau, Laurence Olivier and Jack Lemmon provide
various narration as well as some the finest voice talents in Hollywood including Len Weinrib, Alan Oppenheimer and Richard Dawson.

There have been countless documentaries on Charlie; some have merit (Harry Hurwitz' The Eternal Tramp"" and ""The Funniest Man in the World"") and others are painful to watch.

""The Gentleman Tramp"" is, in my opinion, the finest documentary on Chaplin and is not a
talking heads documentary.  Rather, it unfolds in pictures and story through the use of
transcripts, film sequences, news articles, memorabilia and all in the space of seventy eight minutes.
It's visual style and swift pace makes it one of the best and most entertaining film documentaries
you're likely to see.  Richard Schickel lifted certain sequences from ""The Gentleman Tramp"" (and without permission) for inclusion into his disjointed attempt at a Chaplin documentary.

Once available on VHS (and on twenty five 16mm prints released to libraries and universities), Mr.
Patterson has produced eight hundred limited edition DVD sets of his loving and sometimes brutally honest
depiction of the Little Tramp.  The film was mastered from the original film elements and is breathtaking
to behold. The sharp visual quality and the clean, crisp sound were personally supervised by Mr. Patterson to insure the best transfer possible.  This is one film you will treasure for years to come. If you love the documentaries of Kevin Brownlow and want to see rare and amazing footage of Charlie Chaplin throughout his entire life, you will want to own this award winning film.",1284768000,4,2360,4.982188295165394

7822498,5,6302105870,"This is probably the definitive documentary about Charlie Chaplin. Although it only runs about 78 minutes long, it covers a lot of Charlie Chaplin's life and career, and includes clips from Chaplin's films, interviews with Chaplin, footage from radio broadcasts and newsreels that involved Chaplin, and some color home movie footage. A scene of Charlie Chaplin being presented with an Academy Award in 1972 (at the age of 83) was particularly moving.

Walter Matthau does a great job narrating, and Lawrence Olivier's voice is heard reading some relevant excerpts from Charlie Chaplin's autobiography.

However, I don't recommend buying the single-disc release of this documentary by itself. This same film is available as part of a 4-disc set called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chaplin-Mutual-Comedies-Restored-Edition/dp/B000F4TMIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chaplin Mutual Comedies - Restored Edition</a>"". As terrific as this documentary is, I see no reason to buy it by itself when, for just a little bit more money, you can buy it as part of a box set along with 12 classic Chaplin shorts, plus another documentary about Eric Campbell, a frequent Chaplin co-star in his earlier films.",1394323200,,1233,5.844444444444444
7822499,5,6302105870,"A thoughtfully produced documentary on Chaplin that does not take sides. Enjoyed it thoroughly. The dvd contains a theatrical version, and a two-part version, made for television. My only regret is that I would have loved to have seen some bonus footage that was left out of the final cut, or perhaps footage from the movie's premier.  The small booklet inside the cover was as entertaining as the film. I am so glad I added this to my Chaplin collection.  This documentary is a must-have for any serious Chaplin enthusiast.",1375747200,,524,4.811111111111111
7822500,5,6302105870,"Just received this and watched it again after many years, and I must admit it still brings a lump to the throat, many smiles and leaves me with such admiration for not only the Little Tramp but also the man responsible for this cinematic study.  Rather then taking the tired old approach of countless talking head segments it weaves together film clips, newsreel footage, photographs and a very nice narration (Including Lord Olivier reading extracts from Chaplins memoirs) to create a poetic and informative study of Chaplin.  The footage of Chaplin, in old age, bookending the film is fascinating and gives valuable insight into his latter years....just seeing him so happy and enjoying his beloved family after a very rocky private life gives the viewer hope that theres always light at the end of the tunnel.  A worthy addition to any Chaplin collection, made in the 70s when Chaplin was still alive....partly to promote the reissuing of his films, it is still essential viewing 3 decades later. Comes with a lovely, very detailed booklet from its director.",1359504000,4,1061,4.983050847457627
7822501,5,6302105870,"I initially contemplated ""re-buying"" the Mutuals collection which was later released with this as an additional disc. Thankfully, I did not.

The film attempts a visual portrayal of Charles Spencer Chaplin from his youth in poverty, up to the closing of filming (at which time, Charlie was still alive 1975) living in Vevey Switzerland with his wife and children.

The film would be considered standard affair now, due to the numerous documentaries out there. (I'm particularly fond of the Forgotten Years which attempts to show the man's life during and after his film making)

Notable goods included here are actual bills of Chaplin's early work (not archived in jpeg or anything but displayed during the film) and of most significance is; due to Chaplin's direct involvement in the production, there's a RARE moment which may have been omitted (to my knowledge) from editions of Charlie's ""How to Make Movies""

Here we see something akin to a Duck Soup mirror gag with a leading lady setting her hair in synchronous time to another woman directly across her. Subsequently, we see Charlie do something that he seldom allowed to be seen on film.... we see his DIRECTION of the female lead, right down to him fluttering his eyes for her to imitate.

I know this was his method, but until tracking this down I had never seen it. Thats a treasure to me, an avid Chaplin fan.

Interspersed with legal proceedings, life changes, bio, and marriages, we witness comparisons made to Charlie's life and that of the Tramp- Visually attested to via voice over of Walter Matthau.

The only thing missing sadly, is the interview which precedes the film. I was hoping for a broad interview of the filmmaking genius, however, there are only something like 5 minutes bookending both sides of the film. Even if there were rushes, this would have been invaluable to (gawkers) *fans like us. The thorough booklet enclosed with the film explains how Peter Bogdanovich was going to conduct an interview but it had not gone as planned. Hence the lack of suitable material.

Sadly, I only hope that someday someone can compile a history of the projects Charlie did not complete. Either that or I'll have to get famous and meet the folks of the estate to get a glimpse of the script and/or recording of Charlie's scrapped film ""THE FREAK""... which really should have been his last.  (Countess IS bad.... sorry Charlie)

For what the film seeks to accomplish i believe it does a fine job. Thank you",1354752000,3,2474,4.8274231678487

7822503,5,6302105870,"This is the documentary that started my love affair with Charlie Chaplin and silent film. I was curious about the real Charles Chaplin after seeing ""Chaplin"" with Robert Downey Jr. in the mid-1990s, so when I saw the VHS version of The Gentleman Tramp I decided to give it a look. Not only is it a fantastic introduction to Charlie's films, but it is full of wonderful stills and film clips of Chaplin and his family. Another bonus is that the score is made up entirely of Chaplin's compositions. It is narrated by Walter Mattau, with readings by Jack Lemmon and Sir Laurence Olivier.
The DVD includes 2 versions of the documentary (one theatrical, one shortened for television) and a booklet that were not on the VHS I had. I am so glad that this wonderful record of Charlie's life is now on DVD so that more people can fall under the spell of The Little (Gentleman) Tramp!",1287878400,4,874,4.537974683544304
