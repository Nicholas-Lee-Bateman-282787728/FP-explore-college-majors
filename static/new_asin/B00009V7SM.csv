7993140,4,B00009V7SM,"Michael Worth is probably the only leading martial arts star who PM Entertainment built from the ground up. The company housed a lot of karate actors, from Gary Daniels to Lorenzo Lamas, but Worth was their own homegrown kicker. Worth's distinction is that his vehicles mixed exploitive martial arts action with dramatic content that was above-average for the B-movie realm, and ""Street Crimes"" is one of the best ventures of this sort. While the fight content is not as strong as is the PM norm, the strength of the story makes this one a good choice to initiate new fans.

The story: A rookie cop (Worth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Impact/dp/B000092WBL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Impact</a>) attempts to reform a troubled urban neighborhood by organizing kickboxing matches - an attempt which puts him at odds with the local drug dealer (James Morris,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Cover/dp/6305505802/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Cover</a>).

This is the rare fight flick that has an explicitly positive outlook. Whereas so many other movies view their urban settings pessimistically, ""Street Crimes"" asserts that with the right idea and a little cooperation, established gang members can turn over a new leaf and drug tyranny can be overcome.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-the-Strong/dp/B0000DD76R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only the Strong</a>&nbsp;fleshed out this idea a year later, but this movie is still a fresh air after endless nihilistic adventures. While the idea itself requires a small leap of faith, the characters are more believable, given the time spent developing them. Michael Worth has good chemistry with his onscreen partner Dennis Farina (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snatch/dp/B000093FLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snatch</a>), and several scenes are devoted solely to exploring their personalities and motivations - almost unheard of for this type of film. Worth is a good actor and Farina rocks, though Patricia Zehentmayr (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosalie-Goes-Shopping/dp/6301729870/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosalie Goes Shopping</a>) is uneven as Farina's in-film daughter and James Morris is in serious trouble as the lead antagonist.

Uncharacteristically for PM, the nine fight scenes are a mixed bag and lean towards the substandard. On the plus side, the brawls highlight some rarely-seen performers, like karate legend Satch Williams and jeet kune do mistress Fran Joseph, but their fights are just about the only good ones. Most of the fights are simply unimaginative or questionably-filmed, but others are just sloppily choreographed - just look at the first two. Additionally, while using kickboxing to heal police-gang tensions is a neat idea, it's a little uncomfortable that most of the matches are between white police officers and black or Latino gang members. Know what's also uncomfortable? - Michael Worth's blatant Van Damme-isms: the dude is clearly trying to channel JCVD via his movements, expressions, and exclamations, with occasionally comical results.

Still, the brawls are engaging enough to further the movie and don't detract from its overall quality. I would not recommend this film to anyone who wants to be wowed by physical feats, but karate fans ought to still be entertained, as will be adventurous drama fans. When it comes to B-movies, this one's pretty classy and deserves to be distinguished from countless lesser efforts. Writer-director Stephen Smoke wasn't in the filmmaking business long enough; I wish he had more work.",1426204800,4,3746,6.282101167315175

7993142,3,B00009V7SM,"Though he doesn't have a big list of martial art movies, what Michael Worth stars in I usually thoroughly enjoy.  Films such as ""To Be The Best"", ""Final Impact"" and ""Fists of Iron"" have had a large amount of martial arts action, good B-movie production quality, good supporting characters, and decent storylines.  Street Crimes provides all these elements once again, just toned down to less than I was expecting.

Street Crimes reminds me of ""To Be The Best"", ""Final Impact"" and ""Deadly Bet"" alot from the very beginning.  The same produces (Joseph Meri and Richard Pepin) along with score composer (John Gonzalez) use about the same style of directing and music, which is pleasant for a B movie in my opinion.  Michael Worth's character is too similar to that in his other movies in terms of acting, but he still does a fine job.  The supporting cast is rather enjoyable, and the villain is one big bad dude named ""Gerardo"" played by James T. Morris.  Unfortunately we don't get to see him too much until the end.

The story is good and somewhat uplifting, with a good moral center about a rookie cop (Michael Worth) who hates guns and decides to set up a fight ring in an old youth center for the town's drug dealers and violent gang members to use instead of killing each other.  One of the leaders, Jimmy (Ron Yuan - To Be The Best, Ring of Fire, Deadly Target), challenges Tony (Michael Worth) to a fight.  Afterwards he joins Tony's cause until the leading dealer in the neighboorhood decides to put an end to it.

I expected more fight action then there was.  In most Micahel Worth films, there is enough fight action to fill 2 normal martial arts movies, but Street Crimes has maybe 5 fights, none too long and overly exciting, though a few are done well.  The final fight, no less, is the best, between Tony and Gerardo outside the youth center at night.  It is only a 2-1/2 minute fight scene.  It is obvious Gerardo is a boxer, but his huge size and spinning punch combos are the highlight of the fight.

Street Crimes is a good movie and should provide enjoyable entertainment, but its nothing to get too excited over.  A strong average B action movie, but if you are looking to be wowed by lots of fight action, check out Fists of Iron, To Be The Best, or Final Impact - all starring Michael Worth.",1182211200,,2312,4.519230769230769
7993143,3,B00009V7SM,"I like Michael Worth although he can be annoying with his long kiaaa! sounds like as if he is trying to be a try hard Van Damme. I like my B-Grade martial arts movies and this one will be in the middle of my shelf collection due to the storyline and fight scenes are good. Michael is a rookie cop and is teamed up with a veteran cop who is old enough to be his father. After attempting an arrest on a gangleader, the leader of the gang (Ron Winston Yuan) challenges Mike to a fight at an old broken down youth centre which Mike of course accepts. After defeating the gangleader both decide to help the community by re-opening the centre and if cops and crims have a certain dislike to each other on the street or anywhere else they can sort it out in the ring. The villian is a major drug dealer who doesnt like to see his community being cleaned up and well, ill leave the rest of the plot up to you to find out what will happen next.",1131321600,,935,4.086956521739131
