7005989,5,B00TF8F3MS,"A fantastic movie to see. The portrayal of the different people in their own cultures is so real and sweet. And I like the social issues which are being addressed. A fun movie filled with laughter and sadness.  If you speak German or speak Spanish, is even more of a treat . You cannot go wrong gifting or renting it. I know I will watch it several times. It is also good to practice your language skills.",1452124800,,405,4.259740259740259
7005990,4,B00TF8F3MS,"I saw this on Netflix. It was an entertaining movie. The script was a little far fetched but the acting was very good and there were some nice location shots in Germany and Mexico. Good music as well. I can't give it 5 stars because some of the situations were a bit unbelievable. There should have been some way for Ramon to communicate better with the Germans (maybe a Spanish German dictionary or maybe one of the Germans would have had a smart phone or computer to allow communication). Maybe this script was written before technology could solve the problem. But given the limitations imposed by the script, the acting and directing was top notch.",1451433600,,652,4.678260869565217
7005991,5,B00TF8F3MS,Best German/Mexican themed movie I've seen.,1451433600,,43,6.333333333333333
7005992,5,B00TF8F3MS,Excellent!  Beautiful film.  The cinematography captures the stark differences in cultures between arid Mexico and snow-covered Germany through stunning landscape shots.  The film draws in the viewer to the isolation  of a homeless immigrant with absolutely no resources at his disposal except the kindness of strangers.  This film is destined to be a Christmas classic.,1449964800,,370,5.654545454545454
7005993,5,B00TF8F3MS,This is a fantastic movie. It's in German and  Spanish with English subtitles. It's a wonderful story of a young Mexican man who ends up in Germany trying to make a better life.

7005999,4,B00TF8F3MS,"A one-of-a-kind  story of survival of a young Mexican boy stranded in Germany, filmed during the cold,winter.  I enjoyed watching the character development of each actor. The excellent director was able to portray the cast members, as having feelings of compassion, empathy, sympathy, fear, depression, loneliness and anxiety.  It was refreshing to view a film that utilized professional and non-professional actors. I was entertained watching this movie in three languages, Spanish, German, and English,with subtitles.",1445472000,,519,5.8933333333333335

7006004,5,B00TF8F3MS,What an amazing movie. I lived in Germany for two years and so I'm partial to a good German movie. This is the most heart felt German movie I've seen. Ramon is amazing to watch in his search for happiness. You can't help but feel more appreciative of the things you have in life after watching him move from having nothing to really having nothing and then working his way up. I hope to watch this every Thanksgiving as it's a great movie to show how amazing it is to live in a developed country.,1442102400,,496,4.231578947368421
7006005,5,B00TF8F3MS,"What a touching film, so appropriate in today's very difficult world.

After multiple attempts trying to penetrate the Mexican border with the U.S., young Ramon travels to Germany where he attempts to start a life.  He encounters a number of very interesting Germans, who ultimately find a way to provide a source of income to Ramon's family in Mexico.",1441584000,2,477,4.864197530864198
