8370752,3,B002I9IFXU,"Having seen this video several times and having been a devout follower and dedicated trainer in HIT, I have some issues with this video and the claims.

First - the video's description makes the following claim that Mike Mentzer -
""single-handedly perfected high-intensity theory.""

This is a total falsehood. A truthful and more correct description would be to say he contributed to the promotion and adaptation of HIT style training. He did not in any way single-handedly perfect high intensity theory. This is a blatant inflation (aka boast and lie) made to sell videos and stroke the Mentzer fan base egos. HIT was originated, taught and developed by Arthur Jones. Mike Mentzer spent a very brief period of time (about 6 months) with Arthur at his facility learning and experimenting, then set out on his own to experiment further. These facts and details are sourced from various interviews with Dr. Ellington Darden - Jones' right-hand man for years and years. Also sourced/noted from pages 67-75 in his book The New High Intensity Training. He has said many times that Mike Mentzer actually took HIT style training in the wrong direction.

It can be said that Mike Mentzer was a huge promoter of HIT training and was an outspoken critic of high volume training but he most certainly did not ""single-handedly"" do anything and it has certainly NOT been perfected. Even Dr. Darden himself continues his research and development and experimentation in HIT techniques and publishes books on the subject. Much has changed and improved since Mentzer was a part of it.

The video footage -
Overall, it's done fairly well. The quality could have been done better, even though it was before the HD video and audio of today. This feels somewhat 'slapped' together. Still, the general information and guidance and instruction from Mentzer is solid

The audio -
It ranges from good to poor. You'll often find yourself reversing to hear what got washed out from background interference. Not terrible, but not as good as it should have been at times.

MISC thoughts -
Markus Rheinhardt, the student doing the training, seems about as enthusiastic as a block of wood. Either he was shy or afraid of Mentzer, as Mentzer was known to be very abrasive.

Is HIT valid? Is it real? Does it work? I, personally, had always trained low volume then went solely to HIT and it has made the impossible possible. I now have over 30 years of weight training experience and education under my belt. I have been a personal trainer part time and full time for over 25 years and continue to train my clients with HIT routines and watch them go on to make progress and see the results that eluded them for years. Numerous studies show that while high volume may/can work...why would you spend 2-4 hours in the gym 5 days a week if you don't have to? Do you want to be a dummy working hard for no advantage or do you want to work smart and get ahead?",1451952000,,2922,4.728880157170924
