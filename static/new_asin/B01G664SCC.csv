8762385,1,B01G664SCC,This DVD is merely but a copy (it seems) of an old VHS tape. The quality is bad...really bad. Do not loose your money of this. It is a rip off. The same footage can be found on YouTube at the same quality. Do not lose your time and money on this one.,1471824000,,250,3.7358490566037736
