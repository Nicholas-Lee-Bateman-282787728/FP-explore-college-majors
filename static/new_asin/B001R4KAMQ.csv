8337370,2,B001R4KAMQ,"I loved the drama of this season and there were a ton of great fighters. They seriously just pounded each other this season and it was awesome. Anyway, the ending really got to me because I wanted to see Frank Mir vs Noguera for the Heavyweight title but they didn't. I don't know if they usually don't but they should have. If I buy a DVD, I expect a title fight.",1412899200,,364,4.140845070422535

8337373,4,B001R4KAMQ,"After watching all TUF Seasons, I can say that if you're one of those people that cares most for the drama and the things happening in the house rather than the fights, this have to be your favorite TUF season. Pranks in the house got way out of hand at some point, which included from throwing itchy powder in the beds of the other team to sabbotage their own food since the other team was stealing it, and then, lightweight Junie Browning, maybe the most infamous person in TUF history made the show around himself, by getting drunk whenever he wanted, picking fights with even the light heavyweights on the house, throwing glass to other fighters, etc.

That aside, there was good talent on the show. Minotauro Nogueira was an excellent coach, taking care of his team inside and outside the cage, while Frank Mir was good but not as good as Nogueira, who acted more as a father figure to his fighters. There were good light heavyweight fighters on the show like Ryan Bader, Krzysztof Soszynski, Tom Lawlor. The lightweights had Efran Escudero and George Roop for naming a few.",1353888000,,1079,4.649214659685864
8337374,5,B001R4KAMQ,This was a gift for my husband. I had never purchased movies off of Amazon so I did wonder how well it would be. I have to say I was very happy with everything with my purchase!,1287532800,3,177,3.810810810810811
8337375,5,B001R4KAMQ,"The Ultimate Fighter 8 is probably the best season since season 5. This season features both light heavyweights (205lbs) and lightweights (155lbs). Both weights have some truly talented fighters during the show. Also, like the Ultimate Fighter 7, the fighters have a preliminary fight to get into the house. The DVD set includes all of the preliminary fights in their entirety instead of the highlights that the viewers got during the broadcast. Now for the best part: the coaches. This season features Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira (personal favorite) fresh off his submission win over Tim Sylvia for the interim heavyweight title as well as Frank Mir who's fresh off of his submission win over Brock Lesnar (UFC 81). Both coaches bring their own styles to the coaching of the teams as well as their own sets of guest coaches. As the season progresses, the viewers end up with some truly talented finalists as well as a grudge match between the two coaches (held separately at UFC 92). Also included is the Ultimate Fighter 8 Finale where the two ""champions"" will be crowned. This was definitely one of the more exciting nights of fights during 2008. Give this season a watch. It's definitely the best one I've seen in quite awhile.",1261699200,7,1228,4.880382775119617
