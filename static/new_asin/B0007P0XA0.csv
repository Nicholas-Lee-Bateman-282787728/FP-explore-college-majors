2227816,4,B0007P0XA0,"Five years ago I saw this film on the small screen and found it intriguing, but creepy, with a patronizing approach to some characters. I did love --and still do--the acting in this movie, particularly Rickman. So, I watched it again recently, on a larger screen.  It's actually a really good film. It's very moody, but now I realize that the character depiction is realistic and not patronizing. Some characters are unsophisticated and naive, but on second viewing it doesn't seem a value judgment by the filmmakers. The lead character is very young, innocent, guileless, and dealing the best she can with her abandonment by her mother, not painfully dimwitted, as I thought five years ago. This is a period piece (post WWII) and the production values are superb. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? Both. It's British and maybe a bit quirky by American standards, but it's quite good. Both Hugh Grant's and Alan Rickman's roles are a departure for them and the lead girl is very believable and natural.",1123200000,13,997,4.796511627906977
2227817,4,B0007P0XA0,"I'd have to concur with many of the reviewers here in their thoughts of this film.  I started with certain expectations because of the film adverts.  As often happens when a film already has a form in your mind, I had trouble with the lack of synergy between what was described and what I viewed.  Had no one said anything but this is a foreign film full of quircky characters and a non-formulaic plot, I'd have enjoyed the first viewing much more.  The actors are completely brilliant and if you accept their characters with all their quircky and often sad flaws, this film is more of a tragedy with a cast of eccentric (and often very funny) characters.  After setting aside and coming back to it, I found I really enoyed this movie.  And it's true, each viewing seems to show another layer or has me focus on another character.  Rickman's performance is stellar...no pun intended. :-)  And incredible that a woman the age of (rumor has it) at least 30+ if not 40's) was able to carry off the role of the very affecting Stella.

I love Hugh Grant's character who appears to be the 'bad guy' but finally you're left wondering if he didn't just speed along the inevitable.  He's still a bit of a conundrum, because he's surely written to be unlikable but is that a challenge to the moviegoer to see past the veneer, or is the veneer all their is...hmm...  Oy I'm getting dizzy.  :-)

I really think this rates high in the quicky foreign film category and perhaps not quite an Ameilie but certainly had it been marketed more in that vein the right audience and movie would have found each other!

I'd only recommend this movie to those that like the unusual films that are to the left of the main shelves kind of buried in the back row and you love making that great gem of a find that you feel like no one knows about!  :-)  Hope this helped a bit with making a decision about buying it.  It's available in VHS formate for a bit less, especially used, if you're having trouble with the commitment to the DVD price.  Happy viewing!",1118361600,15,2030,4.425876010781671
2227818,5,B0007P0XA0,"This is an excellent film, moving, sad, even tragic. It is NOT a ""warm hearted comedy,"" as it says on the back of the DVD. And it certainly is not ""hilarious"". The blurb on the cover is quite possibly the most misleading I have ever come across. Despite that, it is a lovely film. It is a solid, serious British drama, with an excellent all round cast. The humour where present is decidedly low key. Its predominant mood is one of sadness and loss, there is warmth to be sure, but certainly not what is projected on the cover or in the trailer. One wonders why the publicists chose to so misrepresent such a fine film. Was it because they were worried its serious and even dark nature would put off the popcorn munchers? Perhaps it would have been better if they had. Then we wouldn't have been saddled with so many negative reviews from viewers who naturally felt short-changed. Then again, this is not a movie that American audiences would readily take to.

Set in 1947, it tells the story of a 16 year old girl, Stella (Georgina Cates), abandoned at birth by a wayward mother and brought up by her aunt and uncle, who aspires to join the Theatre. Into this milieu she willingly plunges herself. She encounters sordid seedy characters. She takes on menial tasks without pay. She embraces all with a gushing eager naivete. She falls for the stage director (Hugh Grant) who in her young innocence she doesn't realise actually has a preference for boys. She then latches on to an aging Lothario (Alan Rickman) who does appreciate young girls. In this darkness in which she finds herself, past and present intersect. The absent mother she faithfully places a call to everyday, the same mother who gave her away years ago, becomes the silent confidant of her hopes and fears. The aging Rickman character constantly pines for his own past even as he happily deflowers the young girl. The stage director's sordid history of seducing and then spurning young men finally comes to a head. All combine to create an air of loss and decay. A nice touch was the use of a lone flute playing ""The Last Rose Of Summer"" whenever the Rickman character thinks back to his lost love. If you know the song, it perfectly encapsulates the mood of this movie. And yes there is a twist at the end, but if you have been paying attention, it won't come as too much of a shock. Although the prudes and the self-righteous will as usual recoil in moral outrage.

New Line Entertainment has given us a fine if bare-bones DVD. The film is transferred in it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picure quality is good, clean and clear with natural warm colors. Black levels are just right. Audio includes the original stereo plus both DTS and Dolby 5.1 remixes. Excellent presentation. There are even optional English subtitles for people who can't get round the British accents. Thank goodness not everybody makes sanitized, Hollywood dross.",1114387200,153,2948,4.700193423597679
2227849,4,B0007P0XA0,"Every now and then a movie comes along that the people distributing the film have no idea how to promote. When that happens the best thing to do is to label it a ""comedy"" especially if it features someone like Hugh Grant who specializes in the genre. Other movies that this has happened to include Bill Forsyth's HOUSEKEEPING (1987) and the 2007 film LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. While there are comic moments, these films are essentially dramas with a dark side which do not appeal to nearly as many people. Once the studios have your money there's almost always a backlash for the film not being what was advertised. That certainly applies to AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE which was promoted as if it were another NOTTING HILL or BRIDGET JONES' DIARY. Nothing could be further from the truth but don't let that stop you from seeing what may be Hugh Grant's finest performance and a real change of pace for Alan Rickman. Just ignore the mislabelling and jump right in.

Director Mike Newell has always made films that have a literary quality to them which comes as no surprise since most of his movies (THE AWAKENING, HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE, the recent GREAT EXPECTATIONS to name 3) are adaptaions of books. He concentrates on characters and dialogue and as a result his movies have a very deliberate pace and his choice of material is often quite dark in tone. Those already familiar with his work will be ahead of the game but others should take the plunge so that they can discover the wonderfully self-contained worlds that his movies allow us to visit. Other films of his worth investigating or revisiting include the well known FOUR WEDDINGS & A FUNERAL, the wonderfully acted ENCHANTED APRIL, and the remarkable DONNIE BRASCO.

AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE is set in post World War II Liverpool and tells the coming-of-age story of a young girl who gets involved with a second rate theater troupe and the people who are part of it. They are led by a classic old school ""queen"" played by Hugh Grant who has a waspish tongue and designs on the male members of the company much to the consternation of his long suffering partner (Peter Firth). Our naive young heroine Stella (Georgina Cates) doesn't realize he's gay at first and idolizes him and when that illusion is shattered, she takes up with the company's Don Juan (Alan Rickman) who sees her as just another conquest until he develops feelings for her. This leads to an amazing discovery and a remarkable ending. The title of the film comes from a line in PETER PAN which the troupe performs throughout the movie. Full of comic moments, ADVENTURE is definitely not a comedy. Like most coming-of-age stories it has its share of pain and self-discovery. The final shot is remarkable in its poignancy. While not a movie for everyone, those capable of going the distance will have a memorable film experience.",1388880000,2,2864,4.703187250996016
2227850,5,B0007P0XA0,"Love any and all Alan Rickman works! The ending of this movie is totally heartbreaking and very, very believable given the circumstances.",1385856000,,137,5.2727272727272725
2227851,3,B0007P0XA0,"This film is not as it was hyped.  It is not a comedy, although there are some humorous moments.  Rather, it is troubling, often painful to watch.  The main characters are all believable and compelling, and the acting on their part is superb.  Hugh Grant amazes once again.  Having just seen him in Music and Lyrics, in which he is charming, likable, and really musically talented, I am impressed with the range of his acting ability since this role is so different.  If you compare these roles to his others in Two Weeks Notice, Bridget Jones, and Love Actually, you see an actor who just keeps pulling talents out of the trunk like magic.  Who knew he could sing!  The dance scene in Love Actually is hilarious.  Grant is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood; there is virtually nothing he cannot do well.  Alan Rickman is also excellent in this film; he gives it a lot of heart.  And the girl effectively combines pathos and humor.  However, this is not a pleasurable viewing experience because of the storyline.  I won't watch it again.",1385769600,2,1050,4.610810810810811
2227852,5,B0007P0XA0,"I love Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman's work. So when I saw this movie I knew I would just love it. The synopisis on the cover listed it as a comedy. So I was prepared to laugh. This is not a comedy it is a drama that reaches beyond the average movie. Watching the struggles, and complexities of all the characters leaves you the viewer comtemplating many subjects. In fact afterwards everyone watching this movie wanted turn off the tv and just talk. The story line presents many subjects and turns the romance of post war England to real life. I don't think I have ever seen anything like it.",1379721600,,591,4.381818181818182
2227853,5,B0007P0XA0,"I first watched this film in 1995 when it was first released, and I recall feeling slightly underwhelmed and unhappy about the ending. Over the years I have watched it again and again (how many films does that happen with) and every time I find I appreciate another subtle layer that I didn't see before. The parallel narratives of Peter Pan and the theatre troupe, the loss of innocence, Captain Hook and Mr Darling and that he is both these characters in Peter Pan and in Stella's life. On later viewings I have really enjoyed soaking up the wonderfully evocative atmosphere created and the period detail. I find myself wondering about P L and his flings with the other women in the theatre - all the characters are so fully formed that they could each hold their own stories, yet they merely weave in and around Stella's tale. It's a film bursting with more than it says, restrained and subtle.
I think this is a rare film, one that wouldn't get made nowadays. It makes me think around it and if a film can do that then I think it was worth watching.",1373328000,4,1053,4.461139896373057
2227854,1,B0007P0XA0,"I didn't like this one, it was boring , pretentious, tedious.  I do not recommend it, even if you want to go to sleep, you would be too annoyed to sleep, and to bored to watch it.",1367107200,2,179,3.8378378378378377

2227856,3,B0007P0XA0,You would have to be disturbed to say that this is a warm hearted comedy. That said the performances in this warped story were the redeeming feature. Nice to see Hugh Grant in a role that is so different to the role he has been boxed into. Alan Rickman is superb.,1360540800,2,263,4.176470588235294
2227857,3,B0007P0XA0,"Sometimes fine novels translate to film beautifully through a kind of alchemy that's very hard to explain. But with this 1995 adaptation of Beryl Bainbridge's darkly complex 1989 novel about a teenage girl working as an assistant stage manager a Liverpool repertory just after the Second World War and falling in love with its resident impresario, it's frustrating that so many of the right elements seem to be in place for a successful translation to the screen but keep falling short. The problems seem most deeply entrenched in Charles Wood's screenplay, which you can't help but admiring for picking up so many of the quirkier and most telling details in the Bainbridge source material and working it into the dialogue; but this somehow results in the characters speaking in a very stilted way that doesn't seem real (the way it did in Bainbridge's original novel). The heroine--a girl completely unschooled in the ways of human behavior, but an avid romantic consumer of literature and theatre--is nearly an impossible part to play, and the producers of this film seem to have found the wrong actress in Georgina Cates, who makes Stella seem not simply artless but nearly mentally deficient (you also wonder why her more sympathetic elders in the theatre company don't simply take her aside for five minutes to explain such obvious things as the impresario's homosexuality or the ways in which he enjoys mentally torturing younger people).

Hugh Grant, doing a rare (but blessedly welcome) character turn as the caddish gay impresario Meredith (a terrific multi-layered character), is quite good, and he's even bettered by Alun Armstrong as the girl's protective uncle and, particularly, Alan Rickman, doing one of his own rare turns as a sympathetic character. As P. L. O'Hara, the gifted but self-destructive actor whom the company engages to play Captain Hook in their Christmas production of PETER PAN, Rickman gets the opportunity not often afforded him onscreen to act more with his body and not with his voice. He proves himself a fine physical actor, and even for once he takes care to curb his sly, slow, sinister speaking tones (so beloved of audiences, yet so often overused by him). The production design by Mark Geraghty and the cinematography by Dick Pope are terrific, and impressively re-create the faded Edwardian grandeur of post-War Liverpool, from its awful unpainted bedsitters to its mosaic-covered tearooms that have seen better days. The director, Mike Newell, does show a nice attention both to period detail and to the feelings of the younger characters (including Meredith's tormented lover Geoffrey (Alan Cox), who advances his career by agreeing to sleeping with the impresario and then gets cruelly cast aside); these affinities have much shaped Newell's later career in directing films that have shown his gifts working with young people and with period pieces (as in the underrated MONA LISA SMILE)",1331424000,3,2935,5.140167364016737
2227858,4,B0007P0XA0,"The movie was interesting...the first movie I've seen where Hugh Grant is a complete and utter A**!! Alan Rickman...which is WHY I got the movie comes in about half hr into it, but is gripping in the bits he's in...He doesn't speak for the first 5 min he's on screen, but his facial expressions tell you everything you need to know!
You must have some knowledge of the ""British"" language and their eccentricities to keep up...
Basically...if you adore Alan it is a must see!

Well, I got something well-acted and British, but I also got exposed to one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. It still haunts me.  At the end my husband and I just looked at each other and said...""Surely not...""  We went back and watched the end again hoping we had missed something and it had caused us to misinterpret the end.  Only Alan Rickman could have made me feel sorry for an incestuous cad and Hugh Grant as a bad guy is never a good idea.  If you do not have a strong stomach for the mental abuse of women and children and men who don't ask the right questions - avoid this movie at all costs.  It makes me cringe to think of it even six months later.",1311552000,2,798,4.14935064935065
2227868,4,B0007P0XA0,I had to order it because nobody had a torrent on line.  It's a great movie.  Alan Rickman is legendary in this.,1299715200,,112,4.045454545454546
2227869,5,B0007P0XA0,"I bought this film, like many others, because Alan Rickman was in it. I suspect my tastes in films is nearly identical to his, because there are few of his films that I do not enjoy on some level.

This film surpassed that level. It is one of my favourite films, right up the with ""The Wizard of Oz"" (and how do you beat that?). I have watched it multiple times in a day before, and will watch it any time, never sick of it. I find it funny, tragic, lovely, disheartening, realistic, completely unrealistic... a film that can encompass that many contradictions in a good way is a rare one.

If you read most reviews on this Internet, they give away the end, so I will not do that. I will simply say it is about a troubled young girl (who I suspect as some deep psychological or brain disorders, to be honest - the character, not the actress, though the story surrounding how she got the part does not make me fond of her) who gets involved in her local theatre. There, she tries to emulate the other performers in everything they do, striving to be a performer herself one day. On the other side of the plot is a mysterious actor there, with talent, but something... dark. A secret he seems to have. You can just tell (whether by terrific screen writing, direction, or Mr. Rickman's acting - perhaps a combination) that he has had an event happen in his life that he would just as soon like to forget.

As someone who spent her youth in a theatre much like the one set in 1940's Liverpool, I can say that the film is brilliance in that aspect. It is very realistic. At Stella's age, I did behave much like her at the theatre, though not as nave, and quite simply, not as stupid and obnoxious. The actress does very well in her part. Hugh Grant plays the director of the plays of the season, and manages to make you laugh and want to throw things at him at the same time. For viewers tired of the whole ""Hugh Grant/romantic comedy"" deal, this will be a breath of fresh air. He is a talented man, and capable of playing a role with an actual bit of depth.

Viewers that are fans of ""Harry Potter"" may find the following sentences humorous, as they apply to AABA, as well as ""Harry Potter"" - ""A guy (Rickman) who wears a long, greasy black wig, is at odds with a younger man named Potter. Potter wears a red and gold scarf and round glasses, and is mean to the guy. Potter eventually wins. Other characters in this movie include a woman named Lily, and a chubby fellow named Uncle Vernon.""

Misleading are the attempts to sell this as a comedy. It is funny. This film is actually quite hilarious, if you have a dry, sarcastic sense of humour. But it is also quite dark in aspects most films do not dare venture to. It can be depressing, and perhaps even triggering for some with a history of sexual abuse. For those who like everything to be neatly wrapped up at the end of the film, you may not like the ending of this film.

I only paid five dollars for this on DVD. But I would have paid twenty-five, an astronomical amount, for me, to buy a DVD. It is simply that good. Mr. Rickman steals the show, but Mr. Grant is right behind him. Georgina Cates, who plays Stella is, again, quite good and perfect for the role, and might have managed to steal the spotlight, were it not for Mr. Rickman's and Mr. Grant's characters and performances.

""An Awfully Big Adventure"" was one of the first films I saw where I thought ""I must have the soundtrack"". The music is composed and conducted by Richard Hartley, who I do believe wrote the music to ""Peter Pan: The Musical"" as well, if I am not mistaken. What a coincidence, as ""to die would be an awfully big adventure"" is where the film's title came from.

The soundtrack is very short. I have not timed it, but I would guess it is about 30 min long, perhaps a bit longer. It is beautiful, a lot of piano and violin. It is all classical, save one song sang by a man in a very Broadway-esque style (the film takes place in a theatre, so you often see them performing shows). For anyone curious, it is neither Mr. Rickman or Mr. Grant, though the film is very much worth seeing for their performances.

It is a great soundtrack, and very much recommended.",1299456000,3,4193,4.304182509505703

I had to guess at the main character's age as I didn't hear anyone mention it except that she wasn't of ""age of consent"". The look of anguish on Alan Rickman's face near the end made the movie. The ending was a bit of a surprise so I won't reveal it.",1266364800,,500,3.854368932038835
2227873,3,B0007P0XA0,"Wow.  I watched this movie with no preconception of what was to come.  I hadn't read any reviews or seen a trailer.  It was one of 4 movies in a Hugh Grant pack; the other 3 were all romantic comedies.  From the picture on the cover I suspected it might be dark, might be a mystery....then I watched it.

The girl, Stella, was a bit odd to me.  I couldn't figure out if she was crazy, dumb (as in really slow), or scarred from some terrible event in her up bringing.  As I watched it, I assumed she was playing a 15 year old girl, and the actress did look very young to me.  I couldn't understand why she was so suddenly ""in love"" with Meredith.  I couldn't even figure out why she wanted to be involved the theatre, or why she didn't want to tip cab drivers?  And I could only assume that the reason she did't know that Meredith had an obvious preference for men was because as a young girl, she wouldn't realize that there was such a thing as homosexuality.  She seemed unintelligent to me (not just innocent).  What did she want out of life?  Where was her spirit?

Hugh Grant acted very well, and I enjoyed seeing him in a different type of role...but I couldn't figure out why his character seemed crazy.  Was everyone in this film supposed to be crazy?

I kept meaning to shut the movie off, because it didn't make a lot of sense to me, and I couldn't figure out anyone's motiviation or any real plot, and sometimes I couln't even understand what they were saying (between the accent and speaking so softly)...but something kept me watching to find answers.  Besides....I was waiting to see Alan Rickman.

I enjoyed Alan Rickman's acting very much.  Somehow I was hoping he would be the hero to help ""fix"" things and clarify things.  I quickly realized that wouldn't happen.  The ""suprise/shocking ending"" was no surprise to me, as there had been subtle suggestions.  I felt most for his character.

I didn't understand Stella's uncle at all.  Why was he even in the movie?  I got nothing from that but more confusion.

I'm not sure if it was just poorly scripted, or if the ""story"" that is was based on wasn't so hot, but I found the overall story not worth watching.  Everything was just so sad and messed up.  Much of the acting was very good.  The ending, as horrid as it was, at least made some sense.  I give the movie 3 stars, because I couldn't stop thinking about it.",1266278400,2,2382,4.372146118721461

The reason the movie is worth watching is for the ending. What a shocker! It's truly jaw-dropping and changes the whole tone of the movie.

2227887,3,B0007P0XA0,"Eager for more Alan Rickman (Die Hard, AHarry Potter 1-5) goodness, I watched An Awfully Big Adventure.

Unfortunately, even though Alan Rickman gets top billing for this picture, he doesn't appear in it until a good half an hour into it. When he does, Rickman commands the stage (literally and as part of the movie's plot). There is one particular look that Rickman shoots Hugh Grant's character that alone makes it worth watching the rest of the two-hour movie. Rickman's performance never falls below excellence and his portrayal of Hook is mesmerizing (and the bits that we see of his stage role are more powerful than even when Dustin Hoffman played the famous pirate in Hook.

Georgina Cates' first major movie performance is impressive because she is able to match Rickman's intensity and bring about pure innocence to her character. Furthermore, at 20, she looks much younger than her 16-year-old character.

Mike Newell's direction is impressive in this film. And the costumes are authentic for the period.

Seeing the backstage of the late 1940s theater makes for an interesting drama, but more so makes the revelation more plausible, although it is highly predictable and as Dickensian as it is soap operaish. All, in all, a must-see film for anyone who has ever fallen under Rickman's spell.",1195516800,3,1303,5.018518518518518
2227888,3,B0007P0XA0,"Here is a film that enthusiastically supports the negative stereotypes of ""theatre people"" cherished by hod carriers, gravediggers, truck mechanics, and short order cooks.  It concerns a bottom of the barrel local stage company in post-war Liverpool, which functions as a repository of wretched refuse unable to find work in better venues.  Virtually every despised group is represented; the troupe is teeming with homosexuals, alcoholics, cruel narcissists, manipulative wretches, and those guilty of sex crimes involving minors both male and female.  We do not find people to like in this film, we only find people to pity - like Bunny, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Firth - and Stella, the tragically damaged and clueless protagonist.  Georgina Cates is thoroughly convincing as Stella, yet another young girl who flees a harsh reality for the theatre's comforting deceptions.

I was amazed to discover that the trailer for this movie presented it as a comedy - Hamlet is funnier.  Even the illusion of happiness - the theatre's stock and trade - is missing.  What we have instead is a world where people play roles without knowing it, and are emotionally mugged in the process.  The ringleader of this horror show is Meredith Potter; Hugh Grant is exceptionally good.  (This movie was made before Grant found his niche as an affable cad and is certainly his best bit of acting ever.)  Potter is the apogee of upper class English entitlement gone to seed; he is clever, thoroughly decadent, lacking in anything remotely resembling a conscience, and pathetic - though his cruelty makes it impossible for us to scrape together a farthing of empathy, our revulsion prohibits it.

The arrival of Alan Rickman - a consistently wonderful actor - as O'Hara, would seems to signal a battle of titans - admirable versus contemptible.  And while watching Rickman play Captain Hook is pure delight, his O'Hara skirts around Potter and drifts off into a somewhat, if not very, bizarre backstory involving Stella's shadowy past.  This derails the film and sends it off in a murky direction since it was never a who-done-it or a psychological thriller.  O'Hara's connection to Stella and her mother may give us an ""aha"" moment - but ultimately it's a distraction because it doesn't inform what's happened up to that point.  O'Hara has a grim realization that puts him in a very difficult position.  But in the final analysis, Stella is still a girl ""abandoned"" by her mother and raised by relatives who trades the sadness of real life and for the sadness of fantasy life.

Good cinematography, good acting, poor pacing, and sloppy scripting.  Would have been far more interesting to see how a loathsome creature like Potter might create great theatre through the dynamic tension between himself and a range of competing personalities cut from finer cloth.",1191715200,3,2845,5.068669527896995
2227889,4,B0007P0XA0,"In the days before Hugh Grant became a romantic comedy icon, it turns out that he could act, and act he does in this marvellous little vignette period-piece.  Here he plays an effete theater director with a penchant for picking up men and then discarding them in the cruellest possible manner. He has assembled, for a short repertory season in the Liverpool of 1957, a cast of has-beens, alcoholics, and other assorted misfits, including the naif fourtnee-year-old Stella who dreams of becoming a posh starlet.

The supporting cast all turn in solid performances, but what really brings the film alive is when Alan Rickman steps into the story about one-third of the way in. This is Rickman in his prime: electrifying, nuanced, darkly compelling yet subtly self-mocking at the same time. It is exceedingly difficult for an actor to play an actor, because the ""visible ham"" element can too easily become, accidentally, ""risible ham.""  The entire cast generally manage to pull off this balancing act par excellence, but Rickman does it best of all.  He exudes sexuality even when dressed as Captain Hook in the pantomime version of Peter Pan. It's no surprise that several of the ladies of the cast would like to rekindle old acquaintances.

But the Rickman character's tragic secret (he believes he has a son, born to him many years before by a woman he knew only as Stella Maris) turns Greek-tragedy like into his denouement.  The naif Stella, whom he seduces almost instantly because he is drawn to her by some alchemical attraction, turns out to be... none other than his daughter.  Struck by this Oedipal twist, Rickman puts in a performance that needs to be watched several times over to be fully appreciated.  In genuine grief and shock, his actor character takes recourse to cliched dramatic gesture.  At first I felt Rickman had missed the mark, but after re-watching the scene in question three times I came to appreciate exactly the effect he achieves.  The net result is to lend a painful pathos to his resultant demise by accidental drowning.

So for anyone looking for a twisted version of Oedipus Rex set in post-war Britain, with all the class consciousness and stultifying conventions of the time here subverted in a most enjoyable manner, this awfully small adventure yields a big reward.",1190851200,12,2304,4.927648578811369
2227890,4,B0007P0XA0,"During the first viewing of this film I was only concentrating on two things.  When, oh when, is my dear Alan Rickman going to come on screen, and what the HECK is the main character ""Stella"" saying?!?  When AR finally makes his debute we are about 50 minutes into the film and he is the tall, cool drink of water  we have been desperate for.  Watching it without the subtitles, you get a general idea of what's happening-but unfortunately you miss several great lines and key points, that at the time they are said mean nothing-but will no doubt come back to you in the last ten minutes of the film.  Over all I do believe it is a good film.  And I have watched it several times, since the first viewing (all with the subtitles on!)

If you like surprises and don't mind ""dark and twisty"" reveals, at the end of a story-then do not read other reviews.  Since AR is very good at the dark and twisty, I have learned to adapt and take nothing for granted.  I went into this film knowing what the ""reveal"" would be at the end.  And to behonest, you are so swept up in the story, that when it is revealed, you can feel nothing but sorrow-as opposed to the ""ick"" factor.  If you are a fan of Alan Rickman's-this is a definite for your library.  Hugh Grant also stars in this film.  Though if dark and twisty disturbs you from the likes of Hugh Grant-this will leave you less infatuated with him.

Also, if you are familiar with the tale Peter Pan, this film wil help to define some concepts left unexplained.  I have just recently read Peter Pan and can now appreciate where the title of this film comes from.",1188086400,11,1604,4.3
2227891,5,B0007P0XA0,"This movie is yet another treat from two seasoned actors.  Hugh Grant's character is a departure from the bumbling but sweet heart throb, and Alan Rickman's character is endearingly vulnerable despite his maturity. It is the absense of innocence in these love affairs that make the story so engaging, and Georgina Cates' portrayal of young Stella is both intriguing and genuine. Whatever the faults of these characters you are still able to empathize with them, as those around them are able to love them. Humorous and at times a bit sad, but always entertaining!",1175558400,5,563,4.98936170212766
2227892,3,B0007P0XA0,"But I have to say, he completely blew me away in this movie. It was high time he was cast against the ""bumbling fumbling romantic comedy"" character he's been stereotyped into since Four Weddings came out. It was a thrill to see him display a facet of his talents I'm sure a lot of people weren't aware he was capable of. He was so deliciously deviant and giddy. Alan Rickman was, as usual, his stunning self. The look on his face when he discovers exactly who Stella is is priceless. He doesn't even need to use words to convey the anguish, fear, and disgust he's probably feeling at the time.

I do have issue with Georgina Cates, however. She was good, I'll admit, but I am less than impressed with how she obtained the role, lying about her age. (casting was specifically looking for a 16-year old girl, Georgina was already into her 20s, and if I understand correctly Alan was none too happy when he found this out.)

Overall though, I'd have to say it is a good, decent film, but I'm at a loss as to why it was categorized as a comedy. It does have its comedic moments, but at its heart it's quite dramatic.",1150243200,10,1112,4.341346153846154
2227893,1,B0007P0XA0,"I found this movie funny in all the wrong places.  It seemed so To me this movie was atrocious. It wasn't particularly funny in any spots, maybe a dry or dark humor. For me the movie was terrible in the acting of the ""young girl"". The actress playing the part I'm sure is a good actress, but the part she had to play seemed lacking to say the least.  After the movie started I had to grab the box cover and check to see if she was playing a mentally retarded person.  I am not here to offend mentally retarded people at all.  Finding out that she wasn't supposed to be mentally retarded I spent the rest of the movie wanting to reach into the television and either shake her or slap her for acting so stupid and clueless.  SPOILER ALERT COMING UP!!!  BEWARE!!!

Spoiler spoiler SPOILER****** The funniest part of the movie was when the Alan Rickman character `fell to his death'.  The entire time he was running on the dock I kept yelling at the Television that he needed to be wearing deck shoes or he was going to fall, alas, he did and I laughed and for the next 30 or so minutes I kept chuckling about that scene.  Maybe in the end it really was a comedy?

Many reviewers, I've noticed don't think this film funny at all, but there are amusing bits if you enjoy dark humor. This film, taking place in the 1940's, deals with the inner-workings, the darker side if you will, of the theater buisness. Stella (Georgina Cates) is a naive young girl trying to make her way in the buisness. She quickly falls in love with Meredith Potter (Hugh Grant)and begins her journey in the industry. This film deals with love, sex, death, alcoholism and much more. Any fan of Alan Rickman will certainly enjoy his superb acting in the film, same goes for Hugh Grant fans. This is an excellent addition to your dvd library.",1146873600,13,776,4.589928057553957
2227895,1,B0007P0XA0,"I watched this movie on BRAVO one time, and they were plugging it as a comedy. Unless you have a screwed up sense of humor, this moive is far from that. It's very tragic, but then again, perhaps I'm just over-sensitive and gullable. I feel that I was mislead and I hate this film and will never watch it again.",1145664000,3,310,4.183333333333334
2227896,4,B0007P0XA0,"First of all, I need to point out that this was definitely NOT a comedy as it states on the cover and on the back. In fact, by the end, you may want a tissue (I know I needed one).

Second of all, I bought this film because of my intense desire to own as many movies with Alan Rickman in them. Mr. Rickman has exceptional talent and brings any character he plays to life as well as bringing something of himself to the roll. I would also like to point out that Hugh Grant does a great job of playing the sleazy director Meredith Potter.

Georgina Cates plays Stella, a young girl who joins the theater and develops a crush on the heartless Potter (Grant), who only has eyes for boys. At first, I thought Stella wasn't very smart, but I think it is more that she is very naive of the world around her. She is unaware that the reason Potter doesn't notice her is because of his interest in boys. Enter P.L. O'Hara(played brilliantly by Rickman), who seems to recognize her from the start. Because Stella is so eager to be like the others(wears a cross because she heard all the actors were Catholic and tries to fake V.D.), she practically ""gives"" herself to O'Hara.

This film has a very tragic ending(hence the tissues), but I found that I liked this film(even though you don't see Rickman until at least halfway through). I give this film 4 stars based mainly on the performances, but I feel calling this film a comedy, when it clearly isn't, robbed this film of 5 stars. If you are a fan of Rickman's (or Grant's), do not hesitate in buying this film. But if you are looking for a comedy then you will be disappointed. I hope this review was helpful.",1144972800,5,1652,4.339805825242719

8050009,4,B0007P0XA0,"I bought this film because I recently became an Alan Rickman fan. I had never heard of it before but I heard from other Alan fans that this is a must see!

At first, I didn't really like it because I couldn't seem to get into it. That was because a lot of the actors, especially Georgina Cates, have strong accents and I had no idea what she was saying. Not to mention, being in my early 30's they were using terms I didn't understand trunk call for example. So...I turned on the English Subtitles! LOVED it after that!

I wouldn't consider it a warm hearted comedy, though there is some comedic relief.  Also, there is a lot of what I call British Humor. It's a little different than what Americans find funny. I thought this movie was interesting, very surprising- especially the ending, sad but also tragic. It's a movie about discovery. Surprising discoveries not only for Georgina Cates character but Alan Rickman's and Hugh Grant's.

I think the title is misleading, though maybe the writers were trying to take a spin on the whole discovery point of the movie. I found the acting to be surprisingly good- especially on Grants part. Alan, does an amazing job as always. Interesting factoid- Georgina lied about her age to get the part. Later it was relieved and Alan took particular care when filming the intimate scenes with her.

This is a movie you need to watch more than once. And after the first time, I found I didn't need the subtitles. There are many layers. It makes you think. If you're an Alan fan, you need this for your collection.",1455062400,3,1551,4.544802867383512

Georgina Cates was not that charming. I am not talking about her look. She didn't rule the film.
Alan Rickman was really good but the wrong thing was he came out too late in the film. And the way he found out about the relationship with Georgina Cates and how he react is so cliche and bulls***, it totally ruined the film.
Hugh Grant didn't do any good at all in this film. it could be anyone to do that part.

This was just before Hugh Grant became an international star, and around about the time of 'Maurice', a really wonderful film which he was wonderful in. It's beautifully art directed, and it looks stunning, but it's a demanding, quite confronting watch that needs an adult audience. The cast is great, the plot is deceptively simple, but it all rings true. There's not a false note here. Hugh Grant uses  his mannerisms to great effect here, as the self absorbed, ruthless second rate theatre directer, and he's perfect, And Alan Rickman is great as the tragic victim of shocking circumstances he knows nothing about. It is very funny, but when it all comes down to it, it's a slice of life British drama that could have come from the pen of the great Alan Bennett. It will disturb you, but you won't forget it easily. It's s neglected gem which will stay with you for days. Can we give Hugh Grant the credit he has always deserved now? Get over the beautiful hair.
