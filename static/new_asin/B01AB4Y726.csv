7597221,5,B01AB4Y726,"Wow I will start off by saying that I love everything Horror and not many horror films impress me today but this movie certainly did and here is my review. I will start with the story which is about a family who moves from the city to the country and then horrible things start to take place. The overall story arc and how it progressed really speaks volumes on how director Corin Hardy portrayed significant skill in his debut feature film. The pace was excellent and never felt rushed which is a common mistake in movies especially horror films. I will move onto the acting which was definitely well cast especially the main protagonist Adam who is played by Joseph Mawle who really sold the show but everyone did great. I will now move onto the action segment which is what really caught hold of me and took me for a loop. I have seen more horror films in my life then I care to admit but I keep going back to the pacing and how it never rushes things so when the action and suspense start to unfold it does a 180 and takes you for a wild ride. The final part being the cinematography and the location. The film was shot in Ireland and it is downright gorgeous. The shots were impeccable with every lens frame bringing tension when needed and all together was shot to perfection. I will close with saying that if you like films like Alien, The Thing and The Evil Dead then you will love this film. I would caution don't just watch 20 min and say I'm done. I mean stick with it and I promise you won't be disappointed. Watch even as the credits role as well and thanks. I would also like to close with saying that the creature design was Phenomenal in my opinion so Bravo to John Nolan. I haven't seen creatures that scary since The Descent.",1460160000,,1743,4.317073170731708

When a conservationist is sent to Ireland with his wife and infant son to survey an area of forest believed to be hallowed ground by the superstitious locals, his actions unwittingly disturb a dark twisted fairy-tale that soon becomes real, when it gets dark the creatures of the darkness prey upon them and they must do anything to try and fight back!!

This yet again is not your average straight to DVD/Blu-ray low budget trashy horror, its actually rather exciting! A very well made monster horror that's certainly one of the best of the year so far, it has a great budget that has been spent very well by a good team who clearly love old school horror, the effects in the movie are almost all good old fashioned practical effects with great monster designs, the movie keeps are dark tone throughout, starts as a slightly slow builder then get stuck straight into the scares and we get revealed more and more as the movie goes on and the finale is very old school monster horror, loved every bit of this movie, great cast and soundtrack too, its certainly something worth going back to a few times too, this is a great horror worth checking out.

7597223,5,B01AB4Y726,"Extremely well done horror film made in Ireland.  It's the perfect horror film for St. Patrick's day in that it concerns, as one character mentions, Fairies, Banshees and Changelings out of Irish superstition and folklore.  The only other film that I can think of that is based on that lovely tradition is Disney's sometimes horrific, DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE.
But this is not a Disney children classic by any means although it does not miss the label classic by all that much.
The tension creeps up on you slowly and in a very interesting and almost subliminal way by inserting extreme closeups which are incomprehensible at first.  We don't quite know what we are seeing and fear is pumped up in the revelation of what it was when the camera moves out to show us .
For example there is an extrememlly thrilling scene where there is there is depicted an injury to the eye.  A hand with needle like fingers that get sharper and sharper and CLOSER and CLOSER to the lead woman's eye has burst through the trapdoor she if force to hold down with her hands and knees.  This is in a mid shot but the camera moves in very slowly in.  Its not done as a pan in but is in edits with each one nearer to the woman's eye.  Mixed in with these terrifying shots are some very extreme frames of what seems to be a wound or perhaps a puncture of some kind, perhaps to the woman's eye.
However, since we see the eye is not yet punctured, its very disturbing as to what it can be.
What we saw there was the beginning of the husband's hand (or perhaps his eye which has been damaged in an early injury to the eye sequence almost as thrilling) as the malignant fungal sludge breaks through to the surface.
The film maker is one to watch as he seems to be well informed as to what can make an intelligent audience shiver in their boots.
For another example, the location is remote and as the horror of The Woods comes nearer and effects the family being, the fact that they have a nearly new born baby with them makes them even more vulnerable.
There is also the dog he's a happy cheerful and protective family member and you think they are going to do him in right away in some mean-spirited fashion as the dog always gets it first in these sort of movies.  The way they handle his fate is completely not the way you think it's going to be with the good doggie not becoming rabid and demonically attacking his family.  The director seems to go out of the way to break with the cheap pops of the horror institution and give is more imaginative solutions.

I was disappointed in the over use of the creepy forest ferries as the film went on.  They were very effective being caught out of the corner of your eye during the first half of the film.  I realize they ultimately needed to be on screen, but they do so a bit early and there are way too many of them  causing the film to loose the uniqueness and subtlety it started out with.
Then there is an unnecessary moment at the very end that is a complete steal from one of the genre's most famous films which I won't reveal.
But the director makes up for this when the film goes to the end credits with an incredible unbroken pan of men clear-cutting a forest.  Again I can't go into detail and spoil the payoff of this very well shot scene.  The the sequence is masterly and is also a great way to get people to stay in the theater a little longer and see a good part of the credits.
There are many on the internet who absolutely hate this film.  I am not sure why that is, but I suspect that its because a good part of this film makes you use your imagination to obtain the horror of it all.  I feel bad for those children of gore who don't know how to get some great moments of horror herein that are there for the taking in this extremely well done picture.",1458345600,4,3801,4.256944444444445

7597247,4,B01AB4Y726,"FULL MOVIE REVIEW
Story finds British tree doctor Adam Hitchens (Game Of Thrones Joseph Mawle) moving into a remote Irish house to examine the trees of the local forest which is being sold to a logging company. As he settles in with his wife, Claire (Bojana Novakovic) and their infant son, strange things start to happen. The locals claim he is trespassing on the land of The Hallow, fey creatures that live in those woods and who will not be happy about his intrusion. Whether it be superstitious locals or creatures of legend, something is stalking the Hitchens family for some malevolent purpose.

Spooky flick is atmospherically directed by Corin Hardy from a script by Hardy and Felipe Marino. The director has a nice visual eye and gives his horror a strong style, as well as, a sense of foreboding. We know early on the Hitchens family has disturbed something primeval and we only get glimpses of these fairie creatures here and there, just enough to let us know that something unearthly is out and about. Once the story reaches the point of outright confrontation with the forest dwellers, we get some really cool and well rendered prosthetic creatures and a tense cat and mouse chase with our beleaguered family. There is some interesting side effects of contact with these creatures and it adds to the spookiness of the film that one family member maybe changing into something out of a nightmare, while being pursued by these creatures of the night. Its not an outright scary flick, but it is a fun monster movie with some really nice prosthetic effects and a touching nod to Stan Winston in the credits that adds a sentimental charm to their use. Its obvious to pick out elements from various horrors that have inspired Hardy, but he pays homage to them well and these elements blend effectively in this dark fairy tale-like story.

While there are some local supporting characters, who are creepy in themselves, its basically all Mawle and Novakovic. Joseph Mawle does a solid job as the scientist who, obviously, thinks all this talk of dangerous fairy creatures is hokumuntil they are staring him in the face. He rises to the occasion to battle these things and adds a touch of nobility when he falls under their influence. Bojana Novakovic portrays a gutsy and strong woman and mother, who fights tooth and nail against these creatures of legend and gives us a character to get behind and root for. They also have a nice chemistry together and they are very believable as a couple.

Overall, this is an entertaining monster flick with definite influences from other horror classics that blends them into an entertaining dark fantasy. There are some very spooky sequences, interestingly designed creatures and some intense action, with some delightfully in-camera rendered SPFX. The beautiful cinematography by Martijn Van Broekhuizen only enhances Corin Hardys visual style and James Goslings music adds to the already atmospheric flick. Maybe not an outright scary movie, but an entertaining horror and an indication that good things might be coming from Corin Hardy.

DISC REVIEW
The picture is gorgeous, the colors vibrant and really presents the visual style of director Colin Hardy and the wonderful cinematography of Martijn Van Broekhuizen, perfectly. The disc is presented in the original 2.35.1 widescreen aspect ratio, preserving the filmmakers vision. The sound is in 5.1 DTS and there is an alternate 2.0 track for those without the home theater set-up.

Now on to the extensive extras which make this disc even more worth having!

The extras start out with a wonderful 50 minute documentary Surviving The Fairytale: Making The Hallow, which is a chronicle of the making of the film from story development, casting and even the training of the creature performers. It uses interviews with the director, cast and crew, with on-set footage to detail the films journey starting with Colin Hardys story and his decision to use practical make-up effects and prosthetics to portray the fairy creatures and the actual making of those creature FX for the screen. We then travel with Hardy and crew to the Galway, Ireland locations as the film begins production. Here we get to see all facets of how this dark fantasy was created, from staging FX sequences, to Hardy directing the actors in their scenes. Its extensive and fun. We then go to post production to see the film start to come together and then on to its initial test screenings and finally its premiere at Sundance. It is a very enjoyable and thorough look at the making of the film, made by the filmmakers themselves with as much heart as they put into their film. You really get a sense of the passion that went into this project by all involved. We also get three making of features derived from the documentary and then finish up with directors storyboards, some illustrations from the Celtic  Book Of Invasions, which is featured in and influenced the film, as well as, Colin Hardys sketchbook and creature concepts. There is also an audio track with Colin Hardy commentary, too. Its over 75 minutes of extras and if you love the filmmaking process, simply enjoy this movie, or both, these are a host of extras youll want to have!

I really enjoyed this movie and agree with star Joseph Mawle that the more you watch it, the more you see. Its a very charming and yet spooky dark fantasy from a filmmaker to watch and Scream Factory has delivered it on a beautiful disc with a host of must-have extraswhich has become their forte.",1465084800,3,5516,4.866879659211928
7597248,4,B01AB4Y726,"The restructuring of Ireland's debt requires the sell off of its virgin forests. Adam Hitchens (Joseph Mawle) from London is there to inspect the trees to the dismay of the locals who believe fairies and baby stealing banshee live there. Adam doubts their tales and blames odd occurrences on the locals as the film builds to the expected plot.

This film was done well. You didn't have to wait until the last scene to see what was going on. Acting and make up was spot on and the plot had some slight deviations within the formula.

I can tell you without hesitation this is the worst, most ridiculous, and [insert any other horrible adjective] ""horror"" movie I think I've ever seen in my life, and I've been watching thrillers for 30+ years.

I was so bored, I almost fell asleep twice, then even watching the last half on 1X Fast FORWARD, I could hardly get to the end without shutting it off.

I'm a fan of the lead actor, so I hope he was paid well to do this POS film. I also hope he has the good sense to stay away from something as atrocious as this in the future.

My God...this movie made ""Drowning Mona"" look like ""Citizen Kane."" Don't spend one dollar, let alone the full retail price. If you get it for free, throw out the disc and insert, and reuse the case. Yes, that's how I really feel, and yes, it was that bad.",1464566400,3,899,4.179190751445087

I would like to strongly recommend that you read no reviews on this movie before watching it.  I actually watched this blind (not even seeing the trailer) and I was quite pleasantly surprised.  However, if you haven't seen it and choose to read this review anyway, I'll warn you by saying SPOILERS when you shouldn't read any further.  It's only one paragraph and it will be in a blue-shaded block quote.

Opening with a serene walk in the mossy woods we meet the local ""tree doctor"" Adam (Joseph Mawle; Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), who collects some strange samples of what is perhaps a slime mold of sorts on a dead animal--if you're not a biologist, just know that's really weird.  Not halfway through examining the sample in his office slash makeshift laboratory his wife Clare (Bojana Novakovic; Devil, Drag Me to Hell) finds more of the goo leaking from their ceiling in their infant's nursery.  Yuck.

From the start I really like this atmosphere painted around our protagonists.  It's dark but naturally serene and isolated with good justification.  Adam and Clare strike us as inquisitive and cautious.  But, as the horror genre would have it, no one is ever really cautious enough when it comes to dealing with the supernatural.  Just perhaps enough to make it interesting as the story persists and we wonder whose suspicions are more accurate: Adam's, Clare's or the townsfolk's.

The superstitious locals don't like Adam's work-related investigations in the woods.  They would warn that those woods belong the ""the hallow""--the baby-stealing fairies and banshees and fey creatures of myth and folklore.  The local police (Michael Smiley; The World's End, The ABCs of Death) offer soft warnings of these legends, but their neighbor (Michael McElhatton; Game of Thrones) who lost his daughter to the woods is more heavy-handed, offering an ancient book of fairy lore depicting changelings.

I applaud director Corin Hardy's first feature length film endeavor.  It takes us from mysterious, to superstitious, to ""pack your bags and let's get outta' here"" without a slow moment.  We find a gradual introduction to the fey creatures accompanied by sounds of stirring about, followed by stronger evidence like monstrous scratch marks and ultimatelyattack by monsters in plain sight.  The creature effects are pretty good and very abundant--we see a lot of them.  These fairy plant zombies look and move in creeptastic ways nuanced with twitches.

Skip the next paragraph to avoid spoilers.

MINOR SPOILERS START HERE  This film is exactly what Leprechaun Origins (2014) really wanted to be, but sorely failed to achieve.  These neat fairy folk creatures assume a more twisted monstrous form than the attractive pixies of storybooks.  Repelled and harmed by iron and light, they are the stuff of evil.  They infect Adam's home with some sort of corrupting, infectious, parasitic fairy slime that acts like a virus on living tissue and rapidly warps and rots wood.  I was expecting the slime to take us in the transformation direction of such films as Blood Glacier (2013), Harbinger Down (2015) or The Thing (2011).  It sort of does, and it certainly takes us on a weird journey.  Just not the path I expected.  It reminded me of Leviathan (1989) and The Cave (2005), and even had a Prometheus (2012) meets The Fly (1986) vibe about it.  SPOILERS END HERE

7597262,4,B01AB4Y726,"This is definitely one of the best modern creature feature films. It does start of a bit slow, keeping with the ""less is more"" approach of some older monster movies but once it picks up, it doesn't let up until the end. The effects used are also practical effects. The cast isn't big, mostly focusing on a man, his wife & their baby with a few others that show up along the way. The real stars are the creatures, they look great & menacing. I also enjoyed the Irish lore in the film. Basic plot is a family moves into a house in the woods that's believed to be cursed by the locals. Naturally the couple doesn't believe it but they quickly change their minds. There isn't a lot of blood & gore, its more focused on the terror from the creatures. The film also has some great atmosphere. The actors playing the couple were good in their roles. Make sure to sit through part of the end credits when they start, until they fade to black or youll miss something. Special features include making of, some featuretts cover SFX, story & such, trailer, story boards & some of the drawing from the book shown in the film.

7597263,5,B01AB4Y726,"This might be one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  Yes I said it.  Not only is this a masterclass horror film.  It is also a masterclass film in general regardless of genre.  I am a movie buff.  But my favorite genre will always be the horror genre.  There is a reason this won the Empire Award for Best Horror film.  Unlike a few other winners, this deserved that designation.  The plot isn't that original, but the execution is one of the best in recent memory.

*Plot*
A family moves to a Ireland forest house and they find out they are in the territory of supernatural beings of Irish folklore known as The Hallow.

Thats the simplest way to describe the plot.  Its so simple and almost cliche, but believe me this is an astonishing film.  For most horror fans the movies first half could be considered a bit slow.  But I thought it was a perfect and brooding build up to the amazing last half which was full of relentless terror and creepiness.  The acting is superb.  The directing is professional for a directorial debut.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  The musical score is eerie.  The creature effects are practical mostly and very well done.  Many have made similar comments, but it truly is a combination of ""The Evil Dead"" and Guillermo Del Toros darker tones.  The last half of the film is a nonstop horror phenomenon.  The visuals are just captivating.  The Irish landscapes are beautiful.  The creatures are terrifying and almost have a Lovecraftian vibe.  The folklore explored will keep many wishing for a sequel.  I know I want one.  The ending will leave you in awe and might even have you in tears.  Don't finish watching as the credits start rolling as there is a treat.  I strongly believe this deserved to be released nationwide in movie theaters as it is thousands of miles ahead of most of the horror trash that do get graced with movie theater releases.  I know this movie would look gorgeous on the big screen.  Oh well, we are looking at a huge future cult horror classic right here.  Turn off the lights.  Turn up the volume.  Spread the word.  Expect to hear more about this film in the years to come.  The director has a big career ahead of him.",1460419200,9,2189,4.5115089514066495
7597264,5,B01AB4Y726,"I think horror definitely made a sort of comeback within the past year or so, or maybe I'm just paying more attention? More and more directors are expressing their love for the kind of horror that uses practical effects, that focuses on its central characters and fleshes them out, not leaving them in a two-dimensional state. We're back to storytelling, not mindless plot.

I've been absolutely loving the Scream Factory + IFC Midnight pairings. The quality of movies are top-notch. This one did not disappoint; The cast is small, focusing on a man, his wife, and their baby. There are supporting characters (the cop, the farmer), but our focus is on this small family that are way in over their heads. The couple have only very recently moved to a house in the woods of Ireland, and the locals are nervous because the woods are not to be disturbed. Creatures from Irish folklore - the Hallow (banshees, beasts, changelings, etc.) - do not want to be trespassed upon, but too little to late. I won't spoil anything for you.

I hope we get to see more horror in the near future from director Corin Hardy. This is his debut, and it's impressive. You can tell a lot of love was put into this movie. It's also very visually stunning, as it was shot in the woods of Ireland. I don't think there are that many horror films that you can call ""gorgeous,"" but this one's close. The Hallow is on Netflix right now, but having the amazing physical copy of the Blu-ray is so worth it - there's about an hour-long documentary, the making of the film. There are also sample pages of the creepy tome featured in the film, and you can see samples from the director's sketchbook. The cover art (both outside and reverse) is wonderful.

8746924,4,B01AB4Y726,"NOTE: SMALL SPOILER!

There just aren't many good horror movies out there that don't involve a crazed maniac running around the woods, or neighborhoods, or even dreams, with a hatchet, or an ax, or a butcher knife, or some deadly concoction of blades. So, I was looking for something indie, where most of the good horror films are found anyway, and I came across this little gem, ""The Hallow.""

There are no ""gotcha"" surprise moments, but there is no need for them. This one is a slow burn as the reveal comes to light for the viewer just as it comes to light for the main character, played with astute attention to horrific detail by Joseph Mawle. There is definitely something in the forest, but Mawle is oblivious to it, even after receiving a litany of warnings from the townsfolk to stop messing around out among the trees. The question I asked here, and that is why I pulled a star, was, ""Why don't they just come out and explain everything to him, so that he could understand why they are acting like obsessed bozos?""  They never do.  They hint around with a lore book, some stink-eye, and rifles, but they never come right out and say it. That was most definitely a plot hole.

Other than that, though. It was very well acted and exceptionally filmed with a tightly written script. It holds your attention to the end. Recommended!",1519862400,,1338,4.558333333333334
8746925,3,B01AB4Y726,"Warning SPOILERS!  THE HALLOW (2015), is basically a ""monsters in the woods"" film with a few effective scenes.  A conservationist from London, Adam (Joseph Mawle) travels to Ireland with his wife Clare (Bojana Novakovic) and young baby boy to survey an area in the Ireland forest believed to be hallowed ground (Which brings up a good question: How would a conservationist know it was hallowed land?)  Adam searches the land and immediately comes upon a horde of tiny creatures who prey among the lost. Pretty soon Alan's windows are being broken (A window replacement man tells Adam, ""If you trespass upon them, they'll trespass upon you""). It's not long before Adam and Clare's house is under full attack from the creatures, who ooze a slimy black liquid that could change people into one of them. Adam believes his baby boy is changing, but Clare doesn't, so there is also some internal strife inside the house. In fact, it is Alan who is changing and not the baby, which makes Clare run out into the forest (Not a good idea Clare!) to try and escape.. Alan goes running after her and subsequently finds the creature's home in a hollowed-out tree and it is full of the little buggers, who don't seem scared of Adam. Clare finds a house of a local resident and finds out the creatures are stealing the children of families (which could be why they are so small). The creatures kill Alan and Clare does something so stupid and unfathomable with her baby (yet it works) that she would be arrested for child endangerment in the U.S. But it satisfies both the creatures and at the end we see the creatures' land being destroyed by a logging company during the closing credits. That'll teach these creatures for fooling around with a woman!  The last shot we see is a log on a truck covered with the slimy black substance, so the creatures will have to find a new home, hopefully not next to mine! Directed and co-written by first -time feature film director Corin Hardy (whose next film seems to be a remake of THE CROW, titled THE CROW REBORN!), who does one right thing that most ""monsters in the woods"" films don't: He actually gives us a clear view of the monsters. There is very little gore or blood, no nudity and no foul language that I could hear, which makes me wonder why this film got a ""NOT RATED"" tag (Probably because they never submitted the film to the MPAA) I have seen hundreds of these types of films and this one neither excites or makes you gasp. It just is what it is.",1510963200,5,2488,4.546875

8746928,3,B01AB4Y726,"A baby in continuous jeopardy always incites a definite primal dread, especially when this poor baby is in the care of a dimwitted dad and a mother who would rather play fix-it with a gloomy old house they decide to call home.  Its not entirely clear why they are out in the middle of nowhere, deep in a dark woodland.  Hes a scientist of a sort who likes spray painting Xs on trees.  He also plays with a dead carcass while his son is strapped to his back!  Supposedly, this careless dad is a conservationist, or does he work for a logging outfit?  At any rate, he has a distant neighbor who is a bit touched, convinced that the fairies stole his daughter.  Eventually, creepy things start happening.  Theres something nasty in the woods.  Too late they realize why there were iron bars on the windows and what a mistake it was removing them.

The creature design is interesting.  The idea of a mold infecting living organisms is interesting but not fully developed.  The action happens later rather than sooner.  And it takes place at night, in the dark, with limited lighting.  What you cant see, you cant be afraid of.  They can call this a fairytale, they can call it mythology, they can call it a hole in the wall, its still just another creature feature.",1507334400,,1261,4.497797356828194
