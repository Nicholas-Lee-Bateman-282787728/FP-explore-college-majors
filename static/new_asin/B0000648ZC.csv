This movie, originally from 1973 (and also know as ""Survival of the Dragon""), stars Li Chin-Kun as the main character, and Bolo Yeung as one of the bad guys (who gets the stuffing kicked out of him!

It is a pretty bad kung fu movie - below average in my opinion - with lots of annoying close-ups, but it does have several scenes of pretty good kung fu fighting. The never-ending final scene (which does not have Bolo Yeung in it) gets to be too much, though; we have two guys pounding and pounding on each other and just continuing forever without sustaining much damage - it actually becomes really tedious.

Li Chin-Kun is a highly capable fighter, though, and worth a look for the dedicated kung fu aficionado. Another of his movies, ""Chinese Tiger"" (available cheaply at Amazon.com), should be really good.",1360195200,,1077,5.515151515151516
