8328001,5,B001NV779W,"I was at the Cape Cod Melody Tent August 14th 2008 show where the DVD was taped.  The DVD does a great job capturing the atmosphere.  The Melody Tent in Hyannis, MA is a great place to see a Saw Doctors concert, the energy from the crowd and the band is incredible. Not sure who enjoys the show more, the audience or the band!  The live CD recording is also very good",1250121600,2,367,4.069444444444445

8328003,5,B001NV779W,"Those Irish, they just know how to lift your spirits and put a smile on your face - the music, the energy, the wit, the spirit of the band and the performances was just what the doctor ordered.  I knew nothing of the band but kept running across them when I'd do an internet search for my Moran family from Clare Island.  I bought the film with no idea of what to expect and enjoyed it from start to finish.  The editing of interviews and live stage scenes had a good rhythm and balance.  In addition to the song I especially enjoyed the bit on climbing Croagh Patrick and the group's observations about smoking in the in pubs.  If you want to have some fun, buy this film.",1244160000,,673,4.2265625
8328004,5,B001NV779W,"The Saw Doctors are one of the best live bands I've ever seen. They are fun, energetic, and have a great stage presence. If you go to a Saw Doctors concert, you're not leaving the show disappointed. Their latest album is a live album from The Melody Tent, which is located in Hyannis in Cape Cod. Every tour, The Saw Doctors play this venue and the crowd is always enthusiastic for them. The band decided to record a live CD & DVD, and this is the result.

The Saw Doctors have had a few live albums released, different set lists of course. This time around we get great songs like ""Macnas Parade,"" ""Galway and Mayo (including Maroon and White),"" ""Will it Ever Stop Raining,"" and of course ""N17."" I liked that they included the ska-ish song ""Will It Ever Stop Raining,"" because it shows the different styles that the band can play. ""This Is Me"" is a surprising song to see on the CD because out of the 4 times I've seen the band, I don't recall them ever playing that one. The live audio could be better in spots but overall, the sound is impressive. From listening to the album, you can get a sense how great the band is live. The band hasn't recorded anything new lately besides ""Bebo"" and the Irish chart topper cover of the Sugarbabes' ""About You Now."" By the way, check out that single for ""About You Now"" because it's an awesome cover! Very rockin' indeed! But even with those 2 songs, the band resurrects songs fans haven't heard in years. I think that's great because you won't just hear the classics at their shows.

Bottom Line: Great live album that makes you want to go out and see the band right away.
Notable Tracks: Macnas Parade, Will it Ever Stop Raining, This is Me, Clare Island, N17, That's What She Said Last Night",1239494400,2,1735,4.41875
