7076103,1,B00V0CLXCQ,"I'm a big Poltergeist fan, i love the first one of course
and the 2nd one is Good aswell, the 3rd sequel shouldn't of been made actually
Heather O' rourke was very sick during the shooting of Poltergeist 3
plus another Actor came in to play Reverend Kane when the original actor Julian beck refused to play the character again
so the 3rd sequel was a bomb at the box office back in 1989, no surprise there

MGM/20TH century fox decided to reissue Poltergeist II on blu-ray again
well this new 2015 reissue is exactly the same as the 2010 blu-ray version
as a big fan of the series i did expect some new special features
But they're both barebones blu-ray reissues total waste of money
maybe 4 stars for this Good sequel, 1 star for this new blu-ray version
but there's been some exciting Good news
Scream factory have just gained the rights to both Poltergeist II & III
and will be released as Collectors edition blu-ray's sometime in November this year
it's just been announced on scream factory facebook page
and being Collectors edition reissues, there will definitely be loads of new extras for sure
maybe a new retrospective featurette with the remaining actors from the film
Craig T nelson & Jo Beth williams
considering most of the cast & crew from the film have now passed away ( Died)
Julian beck who played reverend Kane died many years ago
Director Brian Gibson also died some years ago
and of course Heather o'rourke who tragically died back in 1989
and actress Dominique Dunn who also tragically died back in the mid 80's
so if scream factory were to get new interviews i assume it'l be just Craig t nelson & Jo beth williams i guess
will have to wait and see, but there will be new extras
so don't buy these MGM bulls*** blu-ray reissues
wait for the scream factory blu-ray coming out in september, check scream factory facebook for updates
1 star for the 2010 & 2015 reissues.",1432166400,6,1891,4.545454545454546
7076104,5,B00V0CLXCQ,"The first ""Poltergeist"" was a great POLTERGEIST story. A lot of angry energy over building a new sub-division over some graveyards. However, it is a dated movie, If you grew up in the early 80's, you recognize the house, the TV, the ghost-hunter equipment etc., it is a snapshot of the time.  Still, a fantastic movie. Even the effects have not aged well.
""Poltergeist 2"" is a GHOST story, Native American actor, Will Sampson, is featured as a shaman who knows whats going on and adds to the spookiness. If you leave your mind at the door and just follow the action, it's a great, stand-alone story. To this day, I don't look at children's toy telephones the same..
I hope there is a good DTS mix, when I saw this in the theatre, it was loud. The sound mix on the DVD was not so great. So, I'm hoping there is lots of bass and rumble....",1430784000,2,837,4.3312101910828025
7076105,3,B00V0CLXCQ,"""Poltergeist"" is probably one of the most perfect horror movies ever made. Everything about the movie simply WORKS, from the still-impressive special effects to the acting.

But of course, they had to make a sequel. They always have to make a sequel. And while it's not terrible, ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" is not the tightly-written scarefest that the first movie is -- when it's good, it's very good... and when it's bad, it's unintentionally funny and tends to meander. It's a passable '80s horror movie with a wandering plot.

A year after their house imploded, the Freelings (minus the eldest daughter, whose absence is never explained) have relocated to Grandma Jess's (Geraldine Fitzgerald) house. They're still pretty paranoid about the paranormal, especially since Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) still has those mysterious clairvoyant abilities, and her grandmother encourages them shortly before her death.

Then strange things start happening. A weird old man starts following them and tries to enter their house, and Carol Anne receives calls on her toy phone. The supernatural attacks are back.

Then a Native American shaman named Taylor (Will Sampson), a friend of Tangina's (Zelda Rubinstein), appears to help them by making Steve (Craig T. Nelson) a ""warrior"" for his family. And Tangina reveals the horrifying history of the Beast -- aka a preacher known as Kane -- and why he and his followers are so determined to claim Carol-Anne. No matter where the Freelings go, the evil will follow them.

""Poltergeist II"" is one of those sequels that has a fairly decent story on its own, but it keeps trying to one-up the original (let's have even MORE people fall into the other dimension!). Oh, and we're never told what happened to the eldest daughter. Yes, I know that the actress was murdered in real life, but a token mention of ""She's at boarding school"" would have been nice.

The plot tends to meander somewhat until the final third, when the whole thing finally gels into a real conflict. But that final third is a genuinely disturbing experience, and despite a deus ex machina resolution, it genuinely manages to be more terrifying in places than the original, inducing a wholly different kind of fear. Also, Kane is creepy. All those teeth!

As for the horror elements, they're hit-or-miss. Some are hilariously bad (the killer braces scene -- come on, who thought that was a good idea?), and some are skin-crawlingly creepy (the tentacled, slimy worm-creature with Kane's grinning face).

The cast (minus Dominique Dunne) is the same here, and they all do solid jobs (although at times Nelson comes across as a bit manic) -- JoBeth Williams gives a particularly good performance as Diane struggles to deal with her mother's death and her child's psychic powers. And despite some 1980s-style Native cheesiness, the late Will Sampson gives a great performance as Taylor -- he is a genuinely comforting, calming presence, with gentle humor.

""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" has some ups and downs -- not as good as the original, but a decent horror movie in its own right. The same can't be said for the next sequel.",1427673600,5,3142,4.992351816443595
8708878,4,B00V0CLXCQ,"It's amazing how this movie has improved over the years. I wasn't terribly impressed when I sought in the movies back when I was 16 years old. I was a huge poltergeist fan, and this seemed like a let-down. But I have watched it many times on DVD since then, and I can say that There are some absolutely terrifying scenes in this movie.  The scene where Kane meets the family at the door while it's raining is one of the most unsettling scenes I've ever watched. Perfectly acted as well.",1503100800,,486,4.34065934065934

8708885,5,B00V0CLXCQ,"Well, you knew it was bound to happen at some point after the success of POLTERGEIST in 1982. Good cast and good storyline. Here we have the family staying with a family relative on (JoBeth William's) side of the family. Little do they know that the forces of evil are not giving up on little Carol Anne. A character known as KANE is following her and the family. (The only person missing from the cast in this one is Dominique Dunne, who unfortunately was killed by her estranged bf sometime after the first movie.)
An Indian played by Will Sampson comes and helps the family with the aide of familiar Zelda Rubinstein. I liked the movie as a whole and the storyline. For me, the characters were good, too, especially that of KANE. What a creepy guy and he ""nailed"" the part!

The only Special Feature on here is the Theatrical Trailer. It is not mentioned on the back of the case graphics, but it is there in the menu itself.
The picture quality and the sound are superb.
Sound is DTS 5.1 with optional subtitles English SDH, French, Spanish, Widescreen 2:35:1",1446163200,2,1062,4.53125
