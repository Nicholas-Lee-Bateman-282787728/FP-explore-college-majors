7646548,4,B01BI05MYY,"Pretty frenetic, but laugh out loud for an eight year old. I thought it was a bit on the hyper side, but my grandson was glued to the show
and hopefully absorbed the underlying helpful messages. He really enjoyed it alot.
The characters are a bit on the weird looking side but the message is good.

7646549,4,B01BI05MYY,"Like many families, we choose not to have TV in our home.  We choose select DVD's or streamed shows for our children to watch and decide when to let them indulge in screen time with a quality program.  After watching all of these episodes with the 8 and under crowd in our home, I can easily say it is a show we would let the kids watch again!  While it has some things that are annoying for adult viewers, the messages in each episode are valuable and delivered in an engaging way.

Each episode of this show teaches about a particular charitable organization and they all follow the same format.  In each episode the order of events are:
-  Opening song (I'm not a fan of this one...fairly annoying)
- There are some silly exchanges between the 2 strange looking main characters (who are a bizarre and distracting blend of various animals) At this point in the show, Mack & Moxy are puppet-type creatures.
- We meet a celebrity guest star (there are also brief appearances of a child in each episode)
- The child, Mack & Moxy all decide to go to ""Helpee Land"" and in preparation of the trip (ha ha), they all begin singing and dancing a little song that actually IS catchy!  It is much better than the opening song!
- Mack & Moxy and the child actor all turn into colored balls and fly to ""Helpee Land"" (my kids noted that each one becomes a ball of their color)  Yes, you read that right...they become colored balls and fly off to help people. lol  But, really it works for the show as crazy as it sounds to type it.
- Once in ""Helpee Land"" the show changes from actor and puppet creatures to animation
- They perform some act of service to illustrate the theme/purpose of the episode
- They save the ""Helpee"" (Adorable little nondescript baby creatures who represent a trait or quality)
-  Outwit or outrun the token ""villian"" of the show, Selfish Sheldon (more about him later)
- They return to HQ, become puppets and child actor again and are taught a lesson on the charitable entity that the episode is highlighting
- Closing song & credits start
- Mid-way through the credits/song, a video plays that is geared toward a much more mature audience than the target audience of Mack & Moxy.
- Closing song & credits continue

My kids love this show and there is nothing distasteful about it at all.  Even the usual potty humor, which many modern shows feel compelled to include, is virtually non-existent.  At one point, all the characters slipped and fell, a question had been posed as to what the group should do next and Mack says ""We go down on our cabooses!""  His expressions are innocent sounding and nowhere near the usual stuff that is slipped into children's shows.

This show is definitely intended as a program to watch with your children.  From the appearance of celebrity guest stars Josh Duhamel, Kal Penn and Eva Larue... to little humorous expressions like staying in touch with ""Instant Moose-aging"" and calling Josh's military commander-looking character ""The Admirable"" there are elements that would primarily be appreciated by adults.  And, as I mentioned the videos mid-credits are definitely geared toward adults.

The only criticism my kids had about the show is that the ""Helpee"" that is saved on each episode look identical to each other, except for color.  My kids wanted them to have their own unique appearances.  The other issue they have is with Selfish Sheldon.  He talks with a very thick lisp and they find him hard to understand.  I found him simple to understand myself, but they didn't.

Personally I found the characters to be completely difficult to look at.  I wanted them to be more definitively one animal or another...they weren't charming to me..they were creepy.  lol  But, their strangeness didn't distract my kids at all.

This is a fun show where the main characters have hearts of gold and have earnest desires to help out.  Our kids have learned about ways to help others and I love that!",1469577600,,3941,4.631654676258993
7646550,3,B01BI05MYY,"I thought my son would take an interest in this video but as soon as it started playing he got upset and wanted nothing to do with it. We've tried it a few times with similar results.

I still give it three stars because the premise seems decent enough with a built-in lesson on helping others. It just goes to show how very different each child can be.",1469491200,,353,4.1911764705882355
7646551,2,B01BI05MYY,"This cartoon is a little creepy and terribly depressing. The main characters, Mack and Moxy are simultaneously a little creepy looking (and act a little hyperkinetic and are too loud) and really, really annoying. And Sheldon, a crab-like being who is the ""villain"" of the show and who apparently needs a sanitarium-strength prescription for Prozac, has the irritating habit of lisping. The last thing that I need is for my toddler to mimic sociopaths with speech defects. No children's cartoon, ever, should have children with speech defects.

The first episode features a creature named Noli (apparently some kind of leopard or jaguar cub) that hasn't ever had a friend. She's never read a book, or had one read to her. She's never heard a song. I understand that there are children in the world who are in Noli's position. But that isn't knowledge that I need my toddler to have. I don't show her the ""Peekaboo"" episode of 'Breaking Bad', and I won't show her this. Empathy? Good. Despair? Bad.

The second episode features a dude whose house just catches on fire for no apparent reason when Mack and Moxy show up. That's a WONDERFUL lesson for children. Sometimes, your house just catches on fire. That happened to a friend of mine while he was young and sleeping, and he was traumatized. There are better ways to have that discussion with your kid than this cartoon.

That's as far as we made it, because I was unwilling to watch any more of this.",1468886400,,1451,4.7272727272727275

7646554,5,B01BI05MYY,"These are episodes from a TV show we have never seen.  Each episode has the Herod racing to help someone, and each features a major charity. Watching this may help young children learn to appreciate being kind and helpful.  Plus, the seven year old I watched these with really liked them.  They are fast paced and colorful.  The quality of the DVD was very good as well, and the kids will enjoy the package.",1467504000,,407,4.45945945945946
7646555,3,B01BI05MYY,"This DVD has episodes focused an a specific topic followed by an ad for the associated organization. The episodes are live action and animation. The live action parts reminded me of a thinly veiled Pee-Wee's Playhouse cover, minus the undertone of humor. The DVD is gender and culturally friendly.

My primary concern is how loud and frenetic this DVD is. We had to turn down the TV to half its normal setting. It was too much for the one child in the room who is on the spectrum. Also, the ads are aimed at adult sensibilities and seem oddly placed for a young children's video. The exception is the World Wildlife Fund spot which was quite moving and a rare tranquil moment in this product.

This is just ok for me, a bit over stimulating and shouty.",1466899200,,752,4.481751824817518
7646556,4,B01BI05MYY,"My 5 year old daughter enjoys this show. The characters are cute and there are interesting adventures. I like that the show teaches important qualities like compassion and using your energy to help others in need. I don't like my daughter to have too much screen time but I don't mind her having a little, so the 18-minute length of each episode is perfect. She can sit and watch one episode at a time, and then we can talk about it. There are better written kids' shows out there, but there are certainly worse. I am comfortable recommending this to other parents and their young children.",1466553600,,590,4.5754716981132075
7646577,3,B01BI05MYY,"This DVD provides about an hours worth of entertainment.  Our four year old understood the underlying themes (charity, compassion, helping others, etc) behind each of the four stories, but he was more interested in the characters and their cartoonish actions rather than having any open discussion about what the episodes really meant.  I personally thought the stories were a little silly with too much emphasis about specific charities at each segments end.  While all four causes are worthy, the kids lost focus at that point as they watched the show morph into a mini non-profit advertisement.

Regardless, Mack & Moxy held our kids attention because the stories are entertaining and informative.  Even toddlers will enjoy looking at the shows bright colors, music and dancing.  I recommend trying to catch episodes of Mack & Moxy on PBS channels before making a DVD purchase.  The segments are enjoyable but might not be memorable enough to watch repeatedly.  There are lots of other quality programs that teach similar values without the intensity and without targeting specific causes.",1465948800,,1092,5.235632183908046
7646578,4,B01BI05MYY,"We are a Disney Jr. household. We watch that channel or Netflix programs I have approved. My daughter is 5 , will be six in October. I believe the target age for this is 3-7. If a child is too young, they will not get the messages that are being taught. If they are too old, they will probably think the video is a bit silly. My daughter said it was a bit silly and was distracted by the acting scenes since they were more geared towards younger kids but yet she loved what they had to say. The music, I found it annoying and loud and she just found it annoying. The whole DVD has a great message but the age ranges they are targeting are probably not going to ask to watch this again.

One thing I love is all the non-profit organizations that are benefited. Throughout the whole DVD, it is about helping others and what we can do to help. My daughter is already concerned with the hungry people in the world and also helping animals. This helped open her eyes to other issues in the world that she was aware of but we have not discussed enough.

Again, great message throughout the whole DVD but really hard to gauge what age range will want to watch it.",1465948800,,1156,4.202702702702703
7646579,5,B01BI05MYY,"Interesting blend of live action and animation. Sort of Rocky and Bullwinkle meets HR Puffenstuff in style. Musical numbers are interspersed with educational content. Geared to the under 5 crowd. Our 6 year old thought it was for ""kids"". Each episode features a guest admiral. There are also public service announcements for Save the Children , The American Red Cross  etc who are supported by the DVD sales. Worth the price and supports good causes. Highly recommended!",1465776000,,470,5.103896103896104
7646580,3,B01BI05MYY,"I would probably give Mack & Moxy: The Great Helpee Heroes DVD 3.5 stars.  They are well done and engaging. I'm not sure how often my grandchildren will want to rewatch them; I will update my review if this occurs.  Mack and Moxie are two characters who travel to far off Helpee Land to rescue their friends. The stories are short and entertaining. Each story reinforces a humanitarian effort and reinforces the message of being kind and helping out. This is a huge plus.  They were watched by my grandchildren ages 7, 5 and 3.

Stories in this DVD include:  A friend who reads is a friend indeed, Always be prepared, Feeding Rainbow, and A Ty-Grrr's tale. The kids were very engaged in the DVD and seemed to really enjoy them. They  reminded me of a mix between Yo Gabba Gabba and Barney. The main characters have the look and sound of Yo Gabba Gabba but the friendliness and message was closer to Barney. That being said, even our 7 year old, enjoyed watching the episodes.

I like how each episode reinforces a positive thing that children can do to help out or be more aware of in their daily lives. The stories are engaging and educational. The kids loved the songs. At the end of each episode, the entire song plays and the kids loved dancing to those songs. After watching the episode Always be Prepared"", our two oldest went to their mom and asked about the family emergency meeting place. This issue has been mentioned  before and we often wondered if they would know what to do. After watching this, they both sat down and talked it through with her and then drew a map of where we as a family should meet. in addition to that, they are singing the song ""get low and go"" which reinforces how to get out safely of a fire. That to me is a HUGE win for this DVD. We talk about it at the dinner table or in the car but to have a cartoon come up with a way for them to want to think about it and discuss it is very good.

I do think these are entertaining videos with good ideas that should be discussed; children will enjoy watching these, just not sure how often.",1465689600,,2070,4.314432989690721
7646581,4,B01BI05MYY,"I got this for my niece & she really enjoyed it.  The characters & messages were all very positive, but to her it was just fun & entertaining.  For those that have an interest in teaching their children about humanitarian issues, this would be a good entertainment option.  These same issues are addressed in other similar shows, but probably not as prominently as in the Mack & Moxy show.  Growing up a kid, I learned a lot of values watching shows that had moral point or supplement educational value added.  In this show, the moral point is the focus.  Niece was entertained & she was learning a long the way.",1465689600,,612,4.5181818181818185
7646582,3,B01BI05MYY,"I am one of those moms that believe screen time should be kept at a minimum. I'm not totally against TV, since I feel like there are many programs that do benefit children (Daniel Tiger's Neighbourhood) but many of them are way too busy and loud with quick camera movement and changes. I feel like these spastic shows over stimulate children and could lead to attention problems later on in life.

This show is guilty of this over stimulation. Every single moment is jammed packed with singing, dancing, lights, movement and loudness. At one point on every show, the characters start enthusiastically dancing and singing but that was not enough, no, the camera has to shake along with them too. I got a headache just watching this. And I had to sit through all four shows for the purposes of this review. My seven year old son, who watched it with me, really liked it. He was enchanted with everything he saw and can't wait to watch it again. Which is surprising to me because I thought the target audience was preschoolers but he still liked it.

I do like that the emphasis was on helping others, however I disliked how the comedy of the show focused on how Shelfish Sheldon would get hurt. He is racing against Moxy and Mack to get the Great Helpee because he wants all that happiness for himself. Often, he is foiled at the last minute by either falling off a cliff, getting trampled on (multiple times by Moxy and Mack) or Catapulted from a tree. Each time they show him getting up, and at one point Moxy and Mack ask if he's okay but only after snickering at him getting hurt. I know this is a common theme and has been seen in children's programs for half a century (think Tom and Jerry) but why must we use that as the comedic element in children's programs? I would much rather crude things like fart jokes or booger jokes than people getting hurt.

Anyway, I'm off my soap box.

I'm rating this 3 stars because my son likes it, but I don't like it as a parent. I don't plan to expose my two year old to this, ever, if I can help it.",1465603200,,2042,4.36578947368421
7646583,5,B01BI05MYY,"I have two daughters, ages eight and nearly four. My youngest was by far the most excited to watch this DVD, even though we as a family had no familiarity with the Mack & Moxy program. Our kids tend to watch Disney Jr. and a few Nick Jr. shows more than anything on PBS, with the except of Daniel Tiger on occasion. So this show was new to us, and based on the DVD case art, my youngest was very excited to watch these brightly colored characters go on adventures together.

If you are unfamiliar with the show, here's my description as a first-time viewer: The format is pretty standard for each episode. Always encouraging compassion, friendship, and charity, the characters are sent out on a mission by a celebrity ""admiral"" (this DVD features Josh Duhamel, Kal Penn, and Eva LaRue). The mission consists of traveling to HelpeeLand to rescue a Great Helpee, which is a small furry creature inside an orb or egg of some kind. The mission's theme and the adventure in general relates to the sponsor or partner organization. For these four stories, they were Save the Children, American Red Cross, Feeding America, and WWF.  For example, in the Save the Children episode, Mack & Moxy take a moment to read to and play with a character who had no real friends. The American Red Cross episode focused on fire safety.  The actual adventure segment runs about twelve to thirteen minutes, and it's a mix of puppets and computer animation. The adventure always includes a song, which is then repeated in full with sing-a-long subtitles at the end of the adventure, followed then by a brief infomercial from the partner organization.  You get four of these segments on this DVD, with an approximate total running time of seventy-five minutes.

As a parent, I thought this was a great program that encourages children to be caring, understanding, and helpful. The diverse and educational lessons are outstanding - from learning about food pantries to smoke alarms - and the characters are colorful and sweet. The puppet segments reminded me a bit of cheesy '80s television at its finest, but overall I thought these are very worthwhile programs. My kids had a mixed reaction. The main lessons meant little to my nearly-four-year-old, though she loved the characters and the songs. She checked out, unfortunately, during the infomercial segments at the end of each story. Meanwhile, my eight-year-old, who might actually get something out of the lessons and organization segments, was unwilling to watch much of this at all because the puppets looked ""creepy"" and the whole thing was too ""baby-fied"" for her tastes.  Perhaps somewhere in the middle, a five or six year old might be a better audience. My kids had wildly different reactions, and I was a little disappointed that my eldest was uninterested because of the characters and my youngest only cared about the characters, not the larger lessons at work. As a parent, I would still recommend this.",1465430400,,2945,4.856573705179283
7646584,5,B01BI05MYY,"The Mack & Moxy: The Great Helpee Heroes DVD is great! It is as entertaining as it is educational. I learned a lot about different ways to care for others, compassion, important causes and the joy of helping others. In short, I learned what it is to be a humanitarian.

This DVD features four different episodes from the new childrens TV show, Mack & Moxy. In each episode the main characters go to Helpee Land to save a Great Helpee from evil Shelfish Sheldon. This greedy character wants to steal all the happiness in the world just for himself.

On their journey, they always meet a friend in need who introduces them to a new and important cause. For example, in Feeding Rainbow we learn about the charity organization, Feeding America that provides hunger-relief through food banks/pantries for those who cant afford to purchase their own food. In the episode Always be Prepared, we learn the importance of Emergency Preparedness and about the American Red Cross organization. Basically, we learn  things about what to do in scary situations such as, if there is a fire, we should not grab a thing, get low and go and have a plan of action.

My favorite episode is a Ty-Grrrrs Tale because it is about saving tigers and I love animals. We also learn about the World Wildlife Fund that helps raise awareness and money to help and protect animals.

I love that each episode has a special celebrity guest. My favorite actor on this DVD is, Josh Duhamel who plays the Admirable in the episode, Save The Children. He reminds us the importance of early education. I really like Josh because hes funny and entertaining.
The message of this DVD, like the show, is about inspiring children to become great humanitarians.

I actually had an opportunity to visit a live taping of the show and interview both the creator of the show, Brahm Wenger and Kelly McQuinn, the Co-Executive Producer. One of the things they shared was that the show teaches children in the language that they know. They explained that this is done with the shows bright colored characters, fun music, songs, dance and awesome stories that teach humanitarian lessons. They also shared how excited they are to be part of Americas first kids TV show about causes.

I believe 3 to 8-year-olds will really like this DVD and TV show with its adventurous stories, fun music and lively characters. I give the show five out of five stars, or should I say humanitarian stars.  Finally, I hope that you too will find a cause from this DVD or in your own life that inspires you to become one of the next generations great humanitarians.

The characters travel to HelpeeLand where they have 4 adventures and in each episode, we are introduced to a different humanitarian program.

""A Friend Who Reads is a Friend Indeed"" - This episode is about the joy of reading and introduces Save The Children, a group that provides preschool programs to underserved children around the world.

""Feeding Rainbow"" - talks about hunger and introduces ""Feeding America"", an organization that supports food pantries and food banks around the country.

""Always Be Prepared"" - discusses emergency preparedness, like what to do in a fire.  It introduces the ""American Red Cross"".

""Ty-Grrr's Tale"" - This adventure introduces the World Wildlife Fund and focuses on helping to save tigers.

I enjoyed the video and learned something about each organization.  My 5 year old grandson thought it was okay, and my 8 yr old granddaughter really did like it and I think she also learned something.  It isn't their favorite video, however, and I'm not sure how many times they will want to watch it.  I don't think my 5 yr old was able to understand the concept of these 4 organizations and that's why he didn't like it as much.  My granddaughter immediately wanted to prepare an action plan for fire safety, so that was good.

8750258,5,B01BI05MYY,I had not heard of Mack & Moxy before but my daughter said she had seen these in her school so I jumped when I got the chance to review them.  The main difference between this and other children's shows is that this tries to teach kids a lesson.  Its amazing how so many negative influences are on TV these days so it was great to see this DVD and the positive lessons that they teach. The only real downside that I could see to these was that the episodes seemed rather short... then again it was in line with the attention span of young kids so I guess this really was not an issue.  Older kids will probably find these to be a bit too cheesy but for the target group of under 10 these are entertaining and positive.,1470009600,,718,4.114285714285714

8750260,3,B01BI05MYY,"This show reminds me of something that might be played on a special day during elementary school. It wasn't my favorite thing, as a parent, but my children love the shows and have told me so repeatedly.

It's bright and corny, and sometimes just plain ridiculous. It does have catchy songs, though, so it does have its appeal. Part of the show is done with real people and crazy costumes. Another part is cartoon, with such bright glares that I felt the need to shield my eyes. At the end of the episodes is a commercial for certain programs that have relation to the episode. This part should have been only included as a special feature, as opposed to being played at the end of the episode. My children didn't care for that part, and neither did I. I also didn't care that the ""villain"" of the show has a lisp, considering the target age group. Children with lisps have enough to worry about without being compared to villains. Really, I don't know what they were thinking with that part!
