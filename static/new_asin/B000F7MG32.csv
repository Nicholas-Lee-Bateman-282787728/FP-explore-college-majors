8118788,5,B000F7MG32,"Knit Fashions in Motion has great patterns and excellent instructions. The stitch-along technique is great, because you can do the projects at your own pace. Each step pauses, and you can watch them as much as you need to.

I love the patterns! How cute are the collar and cuffs? I was thinking of giving away my denim jacket, but now it looks brand new, thanks to the groovy pattern on this DVD.

There are great ideas for gifts like the knit bag and cell phone...or you just may want to make them for yourself too!",1154476800,2,516,4.364583333333333
