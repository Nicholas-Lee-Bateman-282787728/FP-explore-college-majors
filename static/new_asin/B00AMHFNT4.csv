8553722,5,B00AMHFNT4,"We've watched this multiple times since receiving it and just love Bud Spencer (and all his movies).  This movie is terrific with a creative plot which of course is masterminded by Spencer who plays Charleston.  Always cool and beefy, Charleston easily pulls off this great heist along with perhaps not so smart side kicks including Lom.  Herbert Lom is best known as Inspector Dreyfus from Pink Panther fame.  Lom was always a great actor and this is no less entertaining in this.  Lot's of laughs in this movie.",1423094400,,513,4.784090909090909
8553723,2,B00AMHFNT4,"Flashback Christmas 1978.  ""Superman-The Movie"" was playing to a packed house at a movie palace in downtown Philadelphia.  Around the corner in a tiny bijou ""Charleston"" was playing out its one week engagement.  Why did one movie capture the zeitgeist and the other not even draw flies?  The thirty-five year mystery is solved.  ""Charleston"" is a half-baked Italian rip-off of ""The Sting"".  The byzantine plot concerns a dapper con artist(Bud Spencer) and his doltish minions trying to rip-off a stupid millionaire (James Coco) in a deal involving a luxury liner.  Thrown into the mix is a stolen Gaugan.  It gets so confusing that you don't care after a while.  Sole selling point is Herbert Lom doing a riff on his Inspector Dreyfus character that played better when he was opposite Peter Sellers.  ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" fans should note the presence of Ronald Lacey who played Todt in that film.",1361750400,,902,4.913907284768212
