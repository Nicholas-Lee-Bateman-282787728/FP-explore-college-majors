8631542,5,B00HCRYIKW,"It's the kind of show that grows on you the more episodes you watch.  The first season or two I would rent the DVD from Netflix and watch an episode or two a night.  By the 3rd and 4th seasons, I was binge watching 6 or 7 episodes a night just to get to the next DVD.  Like all sitcoms, there are hits and misses but the excellent cast of unique characters always entertain.  Being a very character driven show, they can get away with some of the more zany sub-plots because the characters always stay true to themselves and you're genuinely interested in seeing how each reacts when a campus wide blanket fort is erected or the whole school suddenly finds themselves fighting for their ""lives"" in a massive game of 'the floor is lava'.  The humor is wickedly-smart, deliciously self-deprecating, hilariously self-aware, and sometimes so fast/subtle you might miss the joke the first time around which is why I bought the set after renting all the DVDs.  All that being said, this show is a bit of an acquired taste and if you're preference is a more realistic/grounded comedy, it may not be your thing.  I do, however, think most people who give it a chance will end up loving it as much as I did.",1408838400,,1198,4.467889908256881
