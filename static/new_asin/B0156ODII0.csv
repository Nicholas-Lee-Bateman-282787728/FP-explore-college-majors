8732836,2,B0156ODII0,"This appears to be a British TV show (though it may be an American Broadcast as the box states; all the actors & the style are British). I don't ""get it"", & also am having trouble with the accents. While this is not stated, based on the acting styles & the often painted fake backgrounds, I believe it is a TV film of a British play. The histrionic acting style of the play does not fit Karloff at all well (& I do enjoy both his horror roles & his his non-horror roles such as Colonel March & Mr Wong).

As the Thriller episode is available on the Image box set, I am not going to comment on that.

The picture Quality is fair; it's obviously from a worn Kinescope that has likely seen 1 or 2 VHS generations & appears to me to have also once been an avi (some pixelation). The aspect ratio is also slightly off; bodies appear a bit tall & thin in some places, & a bit short & fat in others.

Most importantly, it was burned on extremely low quality media. While they used Verbatim dye, it is bottom of the barrel Verbatim. Using a Nero software error scan, I got a score of 84, with 9900 PI failures. I consider the minimum acceptable score to be 95, with less than 400 PI Failures.

I strongly suggest if you buy this, make a back up. I consider this a defective dvd-r (due to Alpha's bad choice of media), & it will only get worse over time.

Only for Karloff completests.",1489708800,,1376,4.157894736842105
