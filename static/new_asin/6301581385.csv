338605,5,6301581385,"This is a pretty good movie.  I remember catching it on TBS one day while staying home sick from school.  I was still sick the next day, so I got to catch the second part of it.  It was a movie that stuck out in my mind for its portrayal of the war.
A few years later, I remember seeing the book and reading it.  The book was much better because it went into the mindset of the character and why he joined the Marines.  The movie does a decent job of portraying that, but not quite.
Another movie that needs to find its way to DVD.",1080172800,10,531,3.925233644859813
338606,5,6301581385,"Rumor of War is by far the most compelling movie about Vietnam I have ever seen. The way this movie was presented should serve as a model for ALL Vietnam War movies.  The suspense, the background music/tempo, not to  mention Brad Davis's intense acting style made this movie one I want to  own!  Unfortunately, I cant seem to locate the full length feature of 3  hours 20 minutes. All I can find is the shortened version, which cuts out  half the movie. Despite 2 actors in this movie (who played only minor  roles) EVERYONE did a great job, ESPECIALLY Brad Davis.

While I wasn't a grunt in Vietnam, I was a Marine and could identify with all the emotion of this saga.

The only  thing I would take issue with is Cupoto's treatment of anyone who outranked  him.  There were a lot of good high ranking line and staff officers in Vietnam to go with the type Cupoto describes.  It's a shame he couldn't give them a fair shake.

It's a shame things turned out as they did in Vietnam.  The Domino Theory was as valid in the beginning and real reason for  concern.  It turned into crummy war fought by some very good men.  It's a  shame that their efforts, patriotism and heroism are not fully appreciated.",941155200,8,666,4.32520325203252
338696,3,6301581385,"One of the best war movies ever. Hard to fund on DVD. Movie is edited. Hard coded Chinese subtitles. Not the greatest video or audio, but you take what you can get. Quick shipment with no problems",1466899200,,196,4.324324324324325
338697,2,6301581385,I saw this movie when it originally aired on TV in late 70s. This is a poor quality copy. There are large Chinese subtitles that cannot be turned off. This version is heavily edited with several lines and scenes missing that I remember from the original. I wish I had saved the VHS copy I taped off the TV so many years ago. Very disappointing.,1461715200,,344,4.3076923076923075

338699,2,6301581385,This does not have all of the mini series content.  It looks more like someone taped in from tv and just edited out commercials which were run over movie content.,1453161600,,162,4.4
338700,4,6301581385,"Released to TV in two parts in 1980, ""A Rumor of War"" is a film adaption of Phil Caputos autobiographical 1977 book of the same name. The story chronicles Caputo (Brad Davis) before the war, during officer training and, mostly, his service in Vietnam as a lieutenant from 1965-1968.

The version Ive seen (three times) is the original television version, which is 188 minutes, but it might be more like 191 minutes uncompressed. Some say theres a 195-minute version (which is what my VHS says) and this version likely has 4-5 additional minutes with cussing and nudity, which were deleted for TV. This might indicate that the original version was considered for theatrical release.

In any case, A Rumor of War is a quality overview of the infamous war, at least as far as one year through the eyes of an initially passionate young officer. The score is great and varied. There are moody parts reminiscent of Apocalypse Now (1979) as well as many parts that influenced the later Platoon (1986). While its not as good as those movies its surprisingly well done and, as my title blurb says, effectively shows the tedium, the horror, the frustration, the slaughter, the sadness and futility of the war.

The last third switches from Caputo being in charge of a platoon in the bush to being Officer in Charge of the Dead, back at camp where Caputo said senior officers were more worried about trivial matters than strategy, such as casualty stats, movies being played in the open at night, risking mortar attacks, and enemy corpses being displayed as hunting trophies for visiting generals, etc.

You might remember Brad Davis (R.I.P.) from 1978s excellent Midnight Express. Hes formidable as the protagonist and supported by quality actors, like Michael O'Keefe, Keith Carradine and Brian Dennehy. Stacy Keach and Jeff Daniels have glorified cameos. Gail Youngs has the sole mentionable female role.

BOTTOM LINE: ""A Rumor of War"" isn't bizarre and fantastical like ""Apocalypse Now"" or over-the-top like ""Platoon."" It's a thoroughly realistic take on the Vietnam War through the eyes of a green lieutenant and his one-year of experience.

The film was shot in Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, California, and Mexico.

338746,3,6301581385,"I finished the book for at least the third time about a month ago and took a chance on the movie despite the problems mentioned in other reviews. Most complaints had to do with the Chinese subtitles.  I've watched a lot of subtitled movies and now don't even notice them after a few minutes into a movie so they didn't bother me at all.  The visual quality wasn't all that good but it  was acceptable.  The problem was, in my opinion, that the book is just too big for a movie.  The book wasn't intended to be an action filled war story.  There was more thought and emotion that doesn't translate well into a movie. The acting was good enough and the actors fit their parts well enough and the scenes were from the book but there just wasn't enough precedent to what was portrayed to fully understand each scene in context with the rest of the story.  Perhaps the screenwriting could have been better, but I really don't know.  The weapons were correct for the time but the helicopters weren't but there probably weren't  enough H34's in existence to do the job. I don't believe a book like ""13th Valley"" could ever be put into a two hour movie. ""Matterhorn"" would be difficult. ""Fields of Fire"" might make a good one with really good screenwriting.  I don't fault the movie at all and I don't regret buying it. Perhaps it would be better to see the movie then read the book to fully appreciate the cognitive dissonance Caputo had to deal with during his tour.",1436400000,5,1460,4.454887218045113

(I can say that, having spent some time in the bush and Hue City with the 5th Marines in Quang Tri Province back in 1968.)  You really don't notice the indelible Chinese subtitles after a while because the film is so engaging.  I was a little disappointed to see M-1 Garand rifles dressed up to look like M-14s and AK-47s.  There was this one infuriating scene dealing with a body-count, some rotting ""enemy"" corpses, and the arrogance of some Marine brass.  This segment clearly demonstrated exactly why a grunt might be motivated to frag some officers.

Some sizable parts of it are missing; in fact, there is a big gap in between where Lt Caputo (Brad Davis) is at HQ and then transferred back to the field. The scenes of the HQ Marines w/Caputo playing volleyball in the rain are also missing. 2) It looks like this is a poor quality bootleg copy taken from an old VHS tape, perhaps even while the VHS copy was being played on a TV screen in front of a video camera? In any case, poor quality. Unless you are a super hardcore diehard fan of this movie that doesn't mind a bad and incomplete copy of it, then I would not buy it.

Although, I haven't seen many about Vietnam because they were to depressing for me to watch. I watched this movie because a coworker told me about it 20 years ago. It wasn't pushed by Hollywood like other movies. It portrays accurately what that war quickly became. 1/3 was the first Marine combat unit in Vietnam in March 1965. This unit set the standards for this war. Nothing exactly to be proud of, just the truth. It's not the blood and guts but rather the mindset of the high ranks. We went through 3 CO's in six months.

338880,5,6301581385,"The only known way to get the full version of this film (unless you were lucky enough to have recorded it from tv) is this sort of gray market region 0 dvd.

Now most on here are talking about the Chinese subtitles. For those that are wondering since it was never mentioned in any other review, the subs are burned in. They are NOT forced subs but ones truly burned into the picture. When I had received th disc, the first thing I did was make my backup on the pc and take a closer look at the subs to verify if they were forced or actualy burned into the picture.

So again if subs appearing on the bottom of the picture are going to bother you, than skip this disc. However if you are dying to get your hands on the full version of this wonderful film, than suck it up and deal with the subtitles.

I did not find them bothersome at all.

338882,5,6301581385,"This was a ""Made for TV Movie"", that was on two nights for 2 hours each, on CBS. The high quality of this movie is very surprising for a 1980 TV movie. It is a shame this movie has not been put on DVD. The VHS version that I have is 195 minutes, which I believe is the full length version. It is hard to believe this movie is 30 years old now. Some of the actors in this movie are so young it will be hard for you to pick them out, like Laurence Fishburne, as Lightbulb.

The movie is negative against the Vietnam War, but as a veteran, I believe it is fair for Vietnam. The war did get to many over there, and there was nothing to be happy about. In the end those who came home, most eventually went on with their lives, as did the Lt. Philip J. Caputo.

Of course there are some technical issues with this movie. The big thing was the type of Huey helicopters used never made it to Vietnam until very late if at all. The Marines in 1965-66 were mostly flown in UH-34D's, known as ""Goonybirds"". Their hair is long for this time period. The Marines still required the ""High and Tight"" in this time period. In the big picture of things, these are minor. They still don't take away from a well done movie.

This movie stays true to the awarding winning book, which is really saying something for a TV movie. The viewer will also be treated to a great performance by Brad Davis, a great actor who died way too young.
