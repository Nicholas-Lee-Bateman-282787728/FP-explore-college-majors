7793685,4,0962975141,"This was a nice, although short, video to add to my collection.  For those interested in wooden boats, especially the classic Chris Crafts, Gar Woods, and others from the Golden Age, order with confidence.  Lots of cool vintage footage too, which I really like to see.  And good interviews with current builders and restorers of wooden powerboats.  A good mix of the old and the new, but all focused on wood.  My only complaint, and the reason I don't give four stars, is that this film is way too short.  I would like to see at least an hour, preferably more.  The filmakers barely touched the surface.  What they did is nice to look at, but there's a world of wealth waiting beyond this.  If you're into this kind of thing, this video is one of the only ones of its kind.  So you might as well get it.  And if you're curious or casual, it's a good intro, and nice on the eyes.",1237852800,,878,4.2926829268292686
