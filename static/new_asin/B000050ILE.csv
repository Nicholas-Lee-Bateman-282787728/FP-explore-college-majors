1385904,5,B000050ILE,"I saw this movie about 20 years ago on a Saturday afternoon and it blew my mind.  This movie stuck in my mind for years and I always wanted to own it but couldn't find it during the ""home video rental age""... you know, before you could find just about everything on the internet.  Video stores never had it and couldn't find it.  Even specialty stores couldn't find this flick.  Then finally as places like Amazon started selling EVERYTHING every built or recorded... this movie became available again and I couldn't wait to get it.

But yes - after all these years I was afraid that 20 years would have distorted my memory and made this movie better than it really was.  BUT, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this campy flick with it's awesome choreography is still fantastic.  The story is fun, the fights are epic, and the squirting blood is very Kill Bill.  For me, this is a top 20 martial arts film because of its inventiveness and over-the-top story telling and fight scenes.

If you take your martial arts films too seriously - then you probably won't like this movie.  But if you enjoy martial arts films for their fun stories, choreography, and beauty, then this movie should be in your collection.",1308096000,,1215,4.583333333333333

1385907,5,B000050ILE,"First, let's get something straight: this is the best martial arts movie ever.  It demonstrates Real Ultimate Power in ways I cannot even conceive, and if I could my head would explode from the Sheer Ninja Awesomeness of it all.

What, you still don't believe me?  Here's why this movie is the awesomest:

1) This movie features a war between Chinese and Japanese warriors.  So we get kung fu vs. samurai and ninja!  Because this movie has the Awesome Dial turned up to 11, it starts with a fight between two schools, each showing off their amazing martial arts with the most unlikely weapons ever. Who wants plot when you can see guys killing each other with pinky rings?

2) The five element ninjas are all color-coded for your convenience.  Fire, Earth, Wood, Water, and Gold.  Now I know what you're saying: Instead of the five traditional Asian elements of Fire, Earth, Wood, Water, and Metal, why go with Gold?  Gold is wimpy! It's not even a hard metal!  Why not Steel or Iron?

I'll tell ya why: gold is glittery.  And beautiful.  Which is why Gold ninjas wear glittery gold parasol hats that can double as shields.  They can use them to reflect light and blind opponents, and just like every good gold-digger, they can stab you in the back with blades that shoot out from the parasol-hats.  Okay, I was stretching there but stop arguing because YOU SO KNOW THAT GOLD PARASOL HATS THAT SHOOT DAGGERS ARE AWESOME.

3) There are helpful credits that explain everything the ninjas do is based on real weapons.  This movie isn't just a spectacular explosion of martial arts madness, it's educational too: You could write a book report about it and I bet your teacher would totally give you an ALPHA, which is better than the letter A because this movie is so amazing mere letters will not do!

4) There's a hot chick that dresses in fishnets.  And when she's not in fishnets, she's taking off her ninja clothes!  And when she's not taking off her clothes, she's betraying our bitter hero.  Take that feminism!

5) The hero and his three brothers have some of the coolest axe/flag/chain/scissor/polearms/stilts this side of the galaxy.  Their weapons can do ANYTHING.  Including chop people, blow away smoke, cut ropes, tear off limbs, stab people in the gut, and avoid people stabbing you in the groin from underground.

6) At any point in time, our hero who also happens to be a ninja, flips out and kills people.  And I mean a lot of people.  He rips peoples arms off.  He rips peoples legs off.  And at one point he rips their arms AND legs off at the same time!

7) The big boss ninja bad guy uses a fan.  He's THAT confident in his manliness! Don't mess with him, it takes four guys to even have a chance of taking him down!

8) The ninjas are totally silent.  They can get past your stupid falling brick trap and your crazy rooftops bells trap with their eyes closed. Pretty sure they did that by turning the sound off BUT WHATEVER NINJAS ARE AWESOME.

9) The good guys wear capes.  CAPES!

10) Two words: Super. Awesome. Dubbing.",1234137600,6,3040,4.55268022181146
1385918,5,B000050ILE,"FABULOUS, CRISP FIGHT SCENES, PRETTY GOOD PLOT, LO MENG LOOKS HIS BEST, BLACK NINJA CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, MANY DIFFERENT WEAPONS, BUY IT IF UR A COLLECTOR!!!",1227139200,,156,4.814814814814815
1385919,3,B000050ILE,"Wow! I thought I could depend on the opinions of other kung fu fans when making purchases on amazon, wrong! This movie is highly overrated and is not the classic everyone says it is. I'm the first one to give this a 3 and rightfully so. Its worth a watch and then after that you have no reason to keep it around.

Why is this movie so overrated? I don't know, the ninjas maybe? Anyhow the storyline is very corny. For one, why would a master with wisdom send his best fighters out to fight something they have no clue about? Not only that but he already knew it could be a trap and that the ninjas do lots of tricks. Didnt make much sense.

Then after some chick helped knock off your brother and your whole army, why would you second guess killing her? Saying, was I right(for killing her)? Here is a simple outline to this movie. Chinese go against ninjas and get slaughtered leaving Chinese with their 2 best men. One of the best men falls for a chick that the ninjas use to draw outlines of their well guarded house. Chick completes the mission and ninjas slaughter everyone except one of the best men because the chick likes him. Best fighter escapes and goes on to learn ninja. Him and his 3 new brothers go and counter the 5 element ninjas. The end.

Its just not that good. Buy it and judge for  yourself. But if you're a true fan of good kung fu flicks, you'll understand that this isn't a 5 or a classic. Last hurrah for chivalry tears this to pieces. Fearless, 36 chambers, and even the Jade claw tears this apart. This cannot be put up there with the greats because there isn't anything great about it. The best part to me was the last fight where the lead ninja had various tactics and weapons like the spiked feet and the foot cuffs. That was a good last fight. Everything else was corny and poorly thought out.",1219017600,,1825,4.296511627906977
1385920,4,B000050ILE,"One of Chang Cheh's last efforts for Shaw Brothers, ""Chinese Super Ninjas"" is full of surprises, and is one of his best.  Lo Meng is the only Venom in this, but he is joined by the likes of the very acrobatic and talented Ricky Cheng.

Our heroes are in a good-guy clan and win a tournament against some samurai-types.  When the last one is defeated, he kills himself.  Prior to his suicide, he writes a letter to some dude who looks like him, pertaining to dispatching the 5-Element Ninjas for a challenge against the good-guy clan.  When the challenge arrives, the leader dispatches small groups to deal with the ninjas, leaving Lo Meng & Ricky Cheng behind to look after the group's headquarters.  These small groups get absolutely slaughtered by the ninjas.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lo Meng falls for the advances of a ninja-succubus, who helps kill all the good-guys from within when the ninjas attack.  Ricky Cheng survives and escapes for further training from a ninja master he had once learned from.  He and the master's other 3 students then challenge the 5-Element Ninjas.

I prefer straight kung fu to ninja movies, but this is definitely an exception.  Cool, cool, cool.  The fights in this are as creative as any I've ever seen.  Full of cool weapons, styles, and guerrilla tactics.  There is nothing wrong with the picture but it is not remastered or widescreened and is in English only.  Celestial remastered this last year, but I've yet to find any availability in the U.S..  It's hard for me to imagine that Celestial won't release Region-1 DVDs, thereby blowing off the North American market.  Thank goodness for Dragon Dynasty, who have at least shown interest in releasing this.  We all pray they will.  I will certainly purchase it again.  Very violent, entertaining, and recommended.

1385921,5,B000050ILE,To bad you can only give 5 stars. This is an awesome Movie. Some of the scenes are excellent. Some sad parts and some good parts. Some shocking parts. I mean like some really wow parts. One guy is fighting ninjas under ground and gets stabbed from underneath. I mean like wow he steps on his own intestine! You have got to get this movie. If you don't have it GET IT! An amazing Movie. One of the best Shaw releases.,1176163200,3,416,4.148148148148148
1385922,5,B000050ILE,"This is an awesome movie. The fight scences are some of the best aever made, the costumes are great, and the use of weapons are really good. The basis of the movie is that the school of good guys (who wear white) has a tournement  against the bad school (wears back) for control of the martial arts world. But when the bad guys lose, their hired killer throws the master of the good school his ring (which is poisonous) and tells him when he sees another ring like that that it will be his friend/master challenging him.  So the master has his school practice and set up a defense system around their school. A few months down the line, they get a challenge from the killer's friend (the ninja school) to go against their 5 elements. So not knowing what they are up against, the good master sends most of his best warriors to see what the 5 elements are. And that's when all the action starts. Each element uses a unique style of fighting that will leave you awed. This movie is a great tale of revenge and regret. I think you'll really like it.",1150156800,20,1045,4.326530612244898

1385933,5,B000050ILE,"Featuring most of the Venoms, this epic Venoms piece is one of the best films they made.  Light on hand to hand work and heavy on weapons, the weapons choreography and fighting are flawless and eye-popping.  The number of weapons featured is countless, which is great.  The weapons work rivals, if not surpasses, the Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms and The Kid with the Golden Arms.  The movie weighs in at a hefty 1 hour and 48 min., noticeably longer than the customary 90 min. of most films of this genre.  The middle two-thirds of the film is somewhat belabored and bogged down.  However, the movie is book-ended with the most awesome and tightly choreographed weapons fight sequences ever filmed by the Venoms.  The film, while noticeably edited for violence and nudity, is still quite gory.  Also, the film suffers from not being rendered in glorious widescreen Shawscope, as are many of the other ""limited edition"" Venom releases.  The panning and scanning are attentive and efficient, yet the panner and scanner had to work at a frenetic pace at times to capture the action extending from one end of the screen to the other at lighting speed, as well as phalanxes of ninjas popping out of nowhere.  Of the 15 or so Venom flicks I've seen, this rates up there in the top 4 or 5.  This is a must-have for the Venom collector.",993340800,,1329,4.6127659574468085

7929044,5,B000050ILE,I give it 5 stars in the sense that it's a 5 star film within the kung fu genre.  Because let's face it aside from a couple of films most kung fu movies are a 2.5 to 3 at best.  Plenty of action and decent Shaw Bros. production values make this worthwhile.  The picture quality is fine and no problems playing the dvd.  The only problem I have with the film is that the voice dub actors are truly horrible.  If you're a kung fu movie fan you're gonna love it.,1463011200,,459,4.0

7929046,4,B000050ILE,"I finally got a copy of this movie to replace my crapy vhs. This is the story of two rival schools battling it out to see which one is the best til one of the schools allies themselves with the Japanese. But the Japanese intend to wipeout both schools. The lone survivor of one of the schools is left to take revenge for the murder of his master and fallen brothers. This is an excellent film and its action packed but the only original venom in the movie is Lo Meng. That's why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5. The movie has that trademark Chang Cheh Gore and graphic violence so you won't be disappointed there. This version is from red sun which I bought used. The movie played pretty good imo and is remastered. It has 3 trailers. Crippled avengers, 5 deadly venoms and mad monkey kung fu.",1457222400,,790,4.273333333333333
