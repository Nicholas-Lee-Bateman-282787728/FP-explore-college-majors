1948448,3,B0000V48GQ,"I saw this at a local Suncoast and, being a fan of giant monster films, I decided to pick this one up. I wasn't expecting much from this film knowing it was made by a production facility that ended up going bankrupt several years after this film and also knowing it had a shoestring budget (smaller than most of the earlier Godzilla films).

The beginning of the film didn't sit too well with me because the acting seemed so bad and the story is nothing new to this type of genre.

There are a couple of women that look gorgeous in the film but it does not really make up for the sub-par acting. But as the movie progresses, everything seems to get a little bit better.

Aside from the sub-par acting and re-used plot, my major gripe is that Zarkorr, the monster, hardly shows up at all during the film. A sign that the budget was so thin they didn't want to shoot too many scenes of him destroying a miniature city. Even when Zarkorr is shown, it's only for a few seconds and nothing more. It made me upset but it is understandable why there weren't many shots of him. Also, the ending is a little goofy. Considering I thought I had seen it all with my extensive collection of giant monster films, the ending was something new to me and it made me raise an eye-brow. You'll have to see it to understand what I am saying; don't want to give out too much info.

Overall, Zarkorr is a cheap film but it really isn't all that bad. For those who are looking for some good monster sequences, this is not for you, but if you are a casual monster movie fan, you should find some quality to the film.",1102204800,8,1592,4.244224422442244
1948449,5,B0000V48GQ,"Zarkor the Invader is about a monster that  some how  ends up in earth. Is sent to destroy the planet.  Is part of some test.  Zarkor is big and strong practicullary indesctructables.  He does not have  a heat  beam.
He does have  lightning bolts that he suit from his  eyes that are just destructive.  It'sd up to Tonny a local mail men to defeat Zarkor.
The characters are funny.  My favorite is author the nerd computer hacker who is a minor cator in the movie. I am a big Godzilla fan.  Own  all but  4 of.  I  you like this I recomend  Kraa the Sea Monster.",1084492800,5,562,4.150943396226415
1948450,3,B0000V48GQ,"...for what it is, and what Zarkorr! The Invader is is 70 or so minutes of old school man in suit monster mayhem with a semi-decent story padding it out (at least they tried to draft an actual story of sorts).  The movie begins with the titular beastie popping out of a mountain.  After shaking the dust off its scaly shoulders, Zarkorr commences to do what he was sent to Earth for.  Ridding it of Earthling civilization.  Meanwhile a Newark, New Jersey postal worker gets a visit from a tiny Mallrat, and I do mean tiny!  She could fit inside of a spoon.  When fans consider that Zarkorr! The Invader is a Charles Band production, it comes as no surprise that something small had to show up at some point.  The miniscule Mallrat Alien then informs our hero that he has been specifically chosen to fight Zarkorr.  If he fails, then all the world will be destroyed.  Not happy with this, but having no choice in the matter, our hero tries to get help from a lovely cryptozoologist, who is not interested in helping someone who appears to be completely crazed.  Most of the human action is kept separate from the monster stuff because the effects were completed before they had even decided with kind of movie to put it in.  Screenwriter Benjamin Carr has done his best - his story, while obviously padded (and this is 70 minute movie), is a hodge podge of familiar elements that don't quite fit together, yet work in their own scatterbrained way.  Forgiving Full Moon fans might enjoy this, I did.",1081641600,9,1497,4.544776119402985
1948451,5,B0000V48GQ,"Who the heck can honestly say they bought this movie for the wonderful acting, or the completly drawn out plot. BAHAHA! Noone can. Admit you just want to see a giant dragon like dino stomp around and look cool against back drops of fire. THe movie is worth the 10 dollars. Thats all. And Zarkorr diffently was a good effort to make a giant monster movie that we see on Scifi every flipping week. I rather take the old detailed suit than the crappy cgi any day of the week.",1077753600,2,472,4.2555555555555555
1948452,1,B0000V48GQ,"Next to the putrid ""King Kong Lives"", ""Gargantua"" & the original ""Yonggary"" (1966) this is one of THE worst giant monster films ever produced! What a hackneyed, waste of 80 minutes of your life this film is!!And you know what the most incredible thing about Zarkorr The Invader is? It was not Japanese produced but U.S. none the less in 1996!! One somewhat expects this kind of ... poor minatures & inane dialog from maybe  old Gamera films but, not a U.S. film in made in the mid-90's!! The only redeeming quality about Zarkorr is the monster's overall appearance (cool). Unfortunately, one only sees about 10 minutes total of the monster throughout the entire film! The remaining 70 minutes you are subjected to hammy over the top ""acting"" & meaningless gum flapping-YEECH!!",1014854400,,776,4.878787878787879

1948455,3,B0000V48GQ,"""Zarkorr The Invader"" is an amusing hyper-campy rubber-suited monster from space movie with a twist. The film opens with Zarkorr emerging from a California mountainside and frightening the locals. In a piece of editing that about breaks your neck, the action shifts to the Newark apartment of postal worker Tommy Ward (Rees Christian Pugh) who is greeted by a holographic ""teenage mall tramp"" materializing next to his cereal bowl, Proctor (Torie Lynch), who informs him that the monster is a test from an advanced civilization and that he is the sole human who can defeat him as they have identified him as the most average human on Earth. She warns him (while speaking directly to his cerebral cortex!) that Zarkorr is a 180-foot tall horned fire-breathing dinosaur who will home in on him, so he can't simply flee. While speaking in riddles she gives one key hint: ""Zarkorr contains the key to his own destruction"".

Tommy's initial instincts seem poor, as they involve a ridiculous kidnapping of a cryptozoologist, Stephanie (DePrise Grossman), although this does pay off in a hilarious three-way police standoff that firms up the storyline a bit. The protagonists flee to the lair of ""cybernaut"" Arthur, one of the most antisocial characters in memory (for a good guy), and lots of boredom ensues. Indeed, the biggest negative of the film is that there is precious little Zarkorr on display, and a lot of scenery-chewing distractions. I particularly commend the filmmakers for the bit of social commentary in which they have a pro-Zarkorr lawyer arguing that we can't harm him under the Endangered Species Act. Sadly, this bit of satire is even more relevant today than it was when this was made in 1996.

If you do not wish to know the big secret Proctor alluded to in Tommy's Newark apartment, this would be a good time for you to stop reading this review: there's a costume change and a road trip to Arizona to find Zarkorr's off switch (I swear this is a plotpoint). There's intermittent lame city trampling, and the climactic scene in which Tommy must face Zarkorr one on one.

Will Tommy save the world? Will he run for President? Will he ask Stephanie out? I won't answer those questions, but I will say that ""Zarkorr The Invader"" is an amusing parody of the famous Japanese kaiju movies that may have some tedious patches, but is an amusing and unusual departure from the normal Full Moon catalog.",1440720000,,2410,4.844660194174757

1948462,4,B0000V48GQ,"Charles Band produced Zarkorr and Kraa in the following manner. He hired a LA special effects house to film two brief shorts compiled of nothing but giant monster footage (smashing things, roaring, stomping around, etc.).

He then hired a writer to create a story around (and limited to) this completed footage. The result was first Zarkorr! The Invader. It basically works but the monster, who looks cool and has a creepy scream, is on camera far too briefly. The second feature Kraa! The Sea Monster is a little bumpier in its production. The monster footage is clearly of a ""sea monster"" and that is the title of the movie. But the newer footage indicates that it is a space monster. So there is a bit of convolution here. Secondly, Band decided to do some late production re shooting and added some Power Ranger/Star Trek type characters and a space villain. (The original edit of Kraa! was almost identical to Zarkorr in plot. The new footage remedies this but sticks out like a sore thumb as being new and different looking from the rest of the movie. Kraa has the benefit of being made second and utilizes a lot of stock footage from Zarkorr!. Actually, I wonder why Band didn't pad the film with more stock footage from his own earlier sci fi films (ex. Day Time Ended) or public domain military footage to make these flms feel more like classic monster movies. Basically these films are OK but were shot on Video, but given a film look digitally, or electronically. Zarkorr has a ""shrunken"" character that allows the reuse of oversized props from Dollman. Kraa has a creepy puppet character that looks almost the same as the

flesh eating crab monster from Hammer's Lost Continent. (It also appears to be rotting/falling apart right before your eyes. hich gives me the feeling that it too was a reused prop from an earlier production.

The alien villain Lord Doom is also a puppet and loks similar the the cheracter Sutek from Puppetmaster 4/5.",1173657600,2,1953,4.721407624633431

8003427,3,B0000V48GQ,"I watched this movie way back as a kid thanks to a local vhs rental place and now since it's on the Full Moon Features streaming service I think it's time to revisit. At the time of my first viewing, I remember not really liking it. Probably due to the fact that the only giant monster movie I'd seen were Godzilla movies and perhaps a few Gamera ones. All these years later, still not impressed. The movie was just as boring as a remembered, the miniature sized girl from the beginning of the film was just as annoying, and the characters were just as absurd as I remembered. Back then I had nothing to compare these characters and their portayals to but now I'd but them alongside Sharkando and say Shark Attack 3. The monster itself, Zarkorr, has an interested design with it horns and beak-like face, and it has a nice entrance where he explodes out of a volcano. The movie is boring though even through the city destruction scenes. Again, the characters are really bad and the way they defeat Zarkorr is pretty predictable once you get to that point of the movie.",1470528000,,1068,4.482051282051282
