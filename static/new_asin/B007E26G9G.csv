Recording code (date and time) appears",1436486400,,148,4.321428571428571
8515065,3,B007E26G9G,"The film is one big go to the country and exercise project. It is a silent film and works much better silent then with the monotonous piano compliment.

Maybe I did not appreciate this film as I do not like to exercise and be reminded of it.

We get scenes on how healthy the Romans were with their Olympics. Then we have to sufferer though what looks like military drills even for women.

There is artistic dance scenes with historic value as the first appearance of Leni Riefenstahl. There are a hand full of birthday suit scenes. All the youngsters look malnourished. They may be healthy but it looks like they go from malnourished to looking chunky and touting spare tires.

Other than for historic value (I like to collect UFA) there is not much to redeeming. That is unless you are a exercise fanatic.

Just a note the intertitles are in simple German and the stay up long enough to read and have time to interpret if you are not familiar.",1417305600,,945,4.47093023255814
