7823649,5,6302270464,"This is an excellent, yet unusual movie featuring the great John Barrymore near the end of his career (in movies and on stage). There are some autobiographical aspects to Barrymore's role. He plays a once great man of learning who has has lost his inspiration and drive. He has fallen to his base level of alcohol and lives only for the raising of his two children who he has great affection for as they are the only remaining vestitures of cherished marriage to his deceased wife who he still holds the touch for. The storyline is somewhat sentimental yet intriguing. There is a Frank Capra air to this movie directed by Carson Kanin, as it comes from the RKO Studios where Capra did so much of his work. The movie focuses on the down and out Gregory Vance (Barrymore) and two days in his life where he rises from his now obscure life as a alcoholic night watchman to once again take the important role in society he is capable of in his best inspired moments. This inspiration is provided for by his children (Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler as very good child actors) and a new potential flame (new school teacher to his children played by Katherine Alexander). He is called by them to leave behind his alcohol addiction and once again strive to be the great man he once was. Vance has fate step in to help affect that miraculous transformation as he exercises the lone and decisive vote in an important mayoral election in his city (unnamed). With the need for his vote being of such importance that political party bosses are willing to grant Vance the position of Commissioner of the school system, thus putting him once more in a respected role in society. With this and the inspiration of his children and new flame we are led to believe that he will shake off the remanence of his former life. Yes this is an idealistic and simplistic view of life and it's day to day difficulties, but it was a view widely held back in the post-depression 1930s era (1939). The highlight of the movie is at the end when Vance having just cast his vote is called on to make a speech for the crowd and press, and he makes a magnificent speech that only a once great, yet humble, knowledgable man can. Barrymore pulls this off sublimely. It was a typical inspirational monolog of the era when America was raising to it's feet and believing in itself again as war clouds were once more forming around the world.
I would recommend this movie for a couple reasons. First it has John Barrymore as a shadow of himself still showing some of his greatness as a actor. Second, the children are adorable in their roles. Third, it is a simple sentimental story sprinkled with humor, that is a easy and delightful view.",1453507200,6,2700,4.534836065573771
7823650,5,6302270464,"John Barrymore returned to RKO after a long absence to make this wonderful family drama in 1939. At this time, Barrymore's health had deteriorated because of his addiction to alcohol. But his condition was ironically perfect to play the role of Gregory Vance, a former Harvard professor whose ambition in academics dissolved after his wife's death. And since then, he has become lush. He works as a night watchman and takes care of his two children assisted by their teacher played by Katherine Alexander.  The central part of the movie is the brilliant acting of his two children played b Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler, who inspire their father to regain his self-respect by casting the decisive ballot in the local election for a mayor. The movie made a loss of $10,000, but Garson Kanin demonstrated that he is a promising young director at RKO Studios.  The heart-warming screenplay for the story was written by John Twist. This is a forgotten classic and a definite five star movie.",1434499200,,991,4.892857142857143
7823651,5,6302270464,"""The Great Man Votes"" is probably the last good film of the great man himself, John Barrymore. Barrymore (1882-1942) was one of the greatest theatrical performers of the 20th century, but many of his screen performances are not nearly as powerful, and this is particularly true of his work in the talkies. In films like ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936) and ""Twentieth Century"" (1934), which were essentially filmed plays, we get to see what theater goers saw, but in more dynamic vehicles like ""Rasputin and the Empress"" (1932) and ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933), much of Barrymore's charm and charisma are missing. But it is clearly on display here.

Barrymore plays a once respected academic who has sunk into alcoholism as a result of the death of his wife, and he is now threatened with the loss of his two young children.

Katherine Alexander (1898-1981) plays the teacher of Barrymore's children, who takes an interest in Barrymore. Alexander was a well known stage performer who made 44 films, most of them in the 30s. Among other roles she played Queen Anne in ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935) and Madame de Lys in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939).

Cute Virginia Weidler (1926-68) was a wonderful child actress who appeared in several films with Barrymore among the 40 films she completed before retiring at age 17. Among her notable films were ""The Women"" (1939), ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), and ""Babes on Broadway"" (1941). She plays Barrymore's daughter.

The film includes William Demarest and Donald McBride. McBride (1889-1957) plays a politicial hack who is ordered to get Barrymore to vote for his boss, the mayor, played by Granville Bates (1882-1940). McBride appeared in more than 100 films, often crime stories like ""High Sierra"" (1941), ""The Thin Man"" (1945), and ""The Killers"" (1946). I remember him best as the comic foil in films like ""Buck Privates Come Home"" (1947) and ""Little Giant"" (1946).

William Demarest (1892-1983) is best known for his role as Uncle Charley in ""My Three Sons"" (1965-92), but in fact he made more than 100 films including an Oscar nomination for ""The Al Jolson Story"" (1946). He has a brief appearance as a political hack.

The film is directed by Garson Kanin (1912-99). Kanin was nominated 3 times for an Oscar for writing  (""Pat and Mike"", ""Adam's Rib"", ""A Double Life""), in each case with his long time wife Ruth Gordon. He was known primarily as a writer, but directed 18 films of which this was his third.

Pandro Berman (1905-96) produced for RKO. Berman was to RKO what Irving Thalberg was to MGM. Under his careful eye RKO produced such classics as ""The Gay Divorcee"" (1934), ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), ""Alice Adams"" (1935), ""Top Hat"" (1935), ""Stage Door"" (1937), ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), and ""Gunga Din"" (1939). Six of his films earned Oscars for Best Picture.

FWIW - Berman was opposed to hiring Barrymore, but gave in to Kanin who insisted. For his trust, Barrymore rewarded the young Kanin with 24 days of problem free shooting. Kanin said ""He was never late, never objected to overtime, gave everything on every take, and was totally prepared.""

The NY Times said the film has ""its heart in the right place"" and called Barrymore's performance ""engaging"" but criticized the ""amateurish approach and the fact that its secondary characters exist merely as comical, priggish, or sentimental set-ups.""

For fans of Barrymore, this is a must see. Bloated and his skin sagging, he often resembles his brother, the great actor Lionel Barrymore.  It's the last really good performance on screen by John, and his final speech is just wonderful.",1306022400,3,3602,4.965116279069767
7823652,5,6302270464,"This was the first movie I had seen of John Barrymore. Unfortunately you can see the ware that his real life alcohol problem had on him by that time. I read where he could not remember his lines and had to read them off of cue cards throughout the whole movie. But I will tell you, history is right about one thing. John Barrymore was and still is one of the greatest character actors that there ever was. Being an alcoholic, he is actually drunk (in real life) throughout this movie. And yet he can still pull off a prize winning performance. This is a great movie and a great way to meet John Barrymore.",1191283200,,605,4.269565217391304
7823653,3,6302270464,"John Barrymore plays an alcoholic widower raising two young children, a boy and a girl.  He's an intellectual Harvard man, well able to provide for the kids spiritually and intellectually, but not so well financially.  When they get into a bit of trouble at school, do-gooders propose transferring the children's guardianship to his wealthy in-laws.

But due to the awkward workings of the political machinery of their typical American city, Barrymore kind of has the local politicians, up to and including the mayor, over a barrel.  It seems he's the only registered voter in the 13th precinct, which traditionally sets the trend for the rest of the city.  The local political boss, Donald MacBride (a familiar face if you've seen a lot of old detective b-movies - he was often the cop), is ordered to secure Barrymore's vote at any cost.

William Demarest (My Three Sons, etc.) has a small role as another cog in the city's political machine.

It's a pleasant comedy drama mainly due to Barrymore's performance.",1128556800,3,1013,4.958579881656805
