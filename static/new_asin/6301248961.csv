approx. 45 minutes

D.C. FOLLIES was a late night comedy show featuring puppets by Sid & Marty Krofft.  The puppets were usually of political figures (especially former presidents) as well as celebrities of the day.  Another fixture on the show was FRED WILLARD, known for his part in 'ROXANNE' and several of the Christopher Guest movies.

The first episode on this tape features then champ MIKE TYSON.  Tyson chats with Reagan while the Carter, Ford and Nixon bumble around like the three stooges.  In one of the few semi-serious moments, Tyson appears as a voice of reason to the Gipper and Gorby (?!).

The second episode's special guest is Olympic diver GREG LOUGANIS.  Louganis has a funny dance number with Mr. Ford.  Another running joke in this episode is Nixon trying to dispose of the ""missing 18 minutes"" of tape from the Watergate recordings, only to lock himself in a basement.

Many of the topical gags really date the humor but its really just light-hearted fun, especially compared to the lousy political ""humor"" of today.",1185840000,3,1091,4.848648648648648
