6020007,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"I was skeptical about this when I first saw it pop up but I'm glad my wife purchased it for me for Christmas.  The orchestration and unplugged format work extremely well for these songs.  The songs performed cover a vast range starting with ""Speedy's Coming"" from 1974 up to some more recent tunes.  Klaus' voice sounds as powerful as 1984 and the band show their immense talent.  Highlights include Matthias getting to shine with a superb instrumental, ""Still Loving You"",  ""Blackout"" and ""Born to Touch Your Feelings"".  There are some guest appearances from artists I had never heard of but they add some nice variation to the songs.  One caution, if you're looking for hard rock, you will be disappointed.  There is no electric guitar and the songs are all on the mellow side (but since the title is Mtv Unplugged, you should know what you're getting).  The amphitheater in Athens looks beautiful as do the ladies in the audience (and string section on stage as well).  Sound and picture are exceptional on my Blu Ray version.  Please have an open mind and sit back and enjoy.",1388188800,14,1079,4.716577540106952

6020036,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"I work at a classic rock radio station and have played the Scorpions' radio songs more times than I can count. The new Unplugged in Athens CD/DVD shows the strength of great song writing that this band has had for decades, Acoustic guitars and subtle arrangements showcase the art of the song. Great songs do that and that is why they will last at radio and in your own memory banks and show the brilliance of the art of true music by touching the listener one on one. A great performance by a band whose music will stand the test of time",1400371200,,538,4.284313725490196

I have seen it 10 times within a week! All the songs were very well planned and executed. High class everywhere. Someone who does not even like hard rock or heavy metal would love this thing.

6020047,4,B00FQ11PZ2,"as  i  am  a  fan  of  everything  the  scorpions  did  between  1972  and  1984  i  did  not  think  i  would  be  to  crazy  about  this  release,  i  bought  it  for  my  wife,  after  i  watched  this  i  was  a  lot  more  impressed,  this  was  a  very  great  special  show,  my  only  complaint  is  since  this  was  a  special  show  i  felt  uli  roth  should  have  been  invited  to  play  on  the  few  songs  the  scorpions  did  from  the  1970s  but  still  this  is  a  very  good  show  with  special  guests  and  very  good  sound  and  very  good  audiance  participation,  klause  still  sounds  as  great  as  he  ever  has,  it  was  interesting  to  see  rudy  sing  as  well,  anyway  as  rudy  always  says  there  is  so  much  unreleased  scorpions  footage  from  the  past  40  years  tucked  away  in  vaults,  i  at  some  point  soon  would  like  to  see  some  shows  released  that  where  filmed  in  the  70s  or  early  80s,  a  show  from  1978,  1980  or  1982  would  be  awesome!!!!!!!  regardless  of  what  era  you  are  a  scorpions  fan  i  think  you  will  enjoy  this  dvd...........................",1392940800,2,1152,4.237837837837838
6020048,1,B00FQ11PZ2,"I cannot believe all the other reviewers who gave this DVD 5 stars. It is not even worth one star. They have to be shills for the band, since the Scorps fans I know would not buy this crap.

As a long time Scorpions fan, i was looking forward to a great acoustic set of some classics. There are a few deeper cuts on here, and that was attractive too, since the Scorps have not performed some of their best songs live in concert. I purchased the Live at Wacken DVD a while back - and that totally rocked.

As a Kiss fan as well, I think that the Kiss MTV Unplugged was a really great performance. I was expecting a similar high standard from the Scorpions.

I cracked open the DVD and slid it into the DVD player, turned up the Bose sound system and waited for a great acoustic performance. And waited. And waited.  I sat through song after song of Scorpions elevator music performed by none other than  THE SCORPIONS. Horrible! Some of the songs were re-written so badly that the melodies were barely recognizable! And don't forget that they have a bunch of ""guest vocalists"" who sing nothing like Klaus, and make you want to fast forward through the supposedly best songs. I turned the DVD off well before the end of the set.

Why the Scorps decided to degrade their hard driving rock music into an orchestral ensemble (there were about 15 people onstage) with ZERO BACKBONE is beyond me. It is hard to even tap your foot along with these - let alone play along on air guitar or drums. This may well be the last DVD they ever release, and maybe it is quite appropriate that they made their own easy listening versions. Pretty soon you will be hearing these songs straight off the DVD in your local high-rise elevator. No need for anyone else to pollute them that way. The Scorps did an excellent job of that on their own.

Don't waste your money buying this if you expect a good performance.

The Scorps went too far in making their music totally un-listenable.",1392508800,2,1962,4.415512465373961
6020049,5,B00FQ11PZ2,They still got it! Great concert where the arrangement of the songs were perfect (old and new). Sound and picture are spot on...a must have,1392422400,2,139,4.6

6020051,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"I have to be honest.....I've seen the Scorpions twice in concert. The first time was Scorpions/Rainbow and the second time was Fastway/Scorpions. This was maybe 1982 and 1984. They were TOTALLY blown off the stage both times. And I thought they were actually awful at the 1984/Love at First Sting show. I never have and never wanted to see them live again. Scorpions studio albums; mostly great. Scorpions live shows and live albums; uh.....NO !!  Fast-forward 29 years (!??!) and I, by chance, catch a few songs of the Scorpions/Unplugged show from 2013 on VH1 one evening. To put it bluntly, I was shocked. So shocked I decided to get this blu-ray (from a Canadian seller). I wasn't shocked enough to pay Amazon's prices, but....... The sound and picture of the blu-ray are excellent, with 25 songs lasting 2-plus hours, and a ""making-of"" 30-minute piece. The Scorpions, the string section, and the guests were all BRILLIANT !!!! And Klaus Meine still has that killer voice. In reality, five stars might not be enough for this. Great, great show, with Rudy even singing a wonderful tune. This was easily the best Scorpions show I've ever seen and heard. I highly recommend this show/product to anyone who appreciates good music done slightly different.",1391212800,6,1254,4.943127962085308

6020055,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"And just like their previous stunning BR disc, they offer an extended show , filmed state of the art, stunning sound and a marvelous ""making of"" this time in English!  This DOES play in normal USA BR Players as I just received this from a great UK seller Avatar and unlike other promised ""all region"" BR discs that have disappointed , this delivers!!!

2 hour show, 40 minute making of....
I do still have a bit of partiality to the previous acoustic show ""Acoustica"" in some ways but they have a surprising lack of overlap of songs. The arrangements are very clever and feature cool use of accordian and even Rudolf on Sitar!!!  These guys make class productions as their Live BR in 3D attests to. Again, they do hit on many of the hits but they pull from their extensive back catalog for some real gems that they haven't performed in decades and all in all it is a very satisfying show.

For fans , I highly recommend!",1389744000,4,920,4.42603550295858
6020056,5,B00FQ11PZ2,The Scorpions project once again proved their prof. skills to take place today. Live music exists in their hearts. I would recommend this project to watch to everyone who likes live music.,1389571200,3,188,4.90625
6020057,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"I agree with the two previous posters.  I've also watched it at least five times since I bought it.  I too, was not quite sure what to expect.  But my worries were immediately put to rest when I stuck in in my DVD player.  All of the arrangements were perfect and the guys were in exceptional top form, Klaus' vocals spot on.  How do they do it?  After 40 years and they sound better than ever!  I particularly enjoyed Matthias, Rudy's and Klaus' solos.  What a gift this concert is to all of us fans who have loved them for all of these years!  And what a way for the Scorpions to go out!  I for one hope they never retire completely, and the buzz about their upcoming new studio album has got me all excited.  And I still have their entire catalog to keep me rockin' for many more years to come!  Knowing the Scorpions, they'll probably be out on the road once again for the new album!

Oh, and might I add, and certainly not forget the multitude of fine hand picked musicians who shared the stage with the Scorpions on this DVD.  Providing everything from an assortment of strings to mandolin, accordion, harmonica, guitars, backing vocals and more!  They were all sensational.  As were the three guest singers who performed songs alongside Klaus!",1389225600,9,1250,4.464601769911504

8617914,5,B00FQ11PZ2,"In a word ""Stunning!"" I never liked the Scorpions very much, and even though I like some metal bands like Iron Maiden, I'm not a huge metal fan. I do like many kinds of music. I went through my goth phase for a decade or so, and have seen many bands live in person. U2, Savages, Shadow Project, Bauhaus, Ramones, Bowie, Iggy Pop, Cramps, The Cure, Morrissey, on and on. This concernt is definately the best live show I have ever seen. I have seen U2 7 times including Zoo TV, And the oiginal Joshua Tree tour. Since they are the closest band when it comes to playing ballads and songs that touch the soul I have seen in person, I mention this particularly because of that reason. I can say without hesitation numerous songs in this concert were incredibly moving and beautifuly played. I think the Scorpions missed their real calling. I have rarely heard so many moving songs in one concert. And some so beautiful I poured quite a few tears. Some fans of their metal performances may not like this, but if you love powerful ballads and heavenly goosebumps you will probably love this concert. Klaus and the other original band members share the stage with other performers from Germany, Sweden and Italy. Everyone plays and sings to heavenly perfection. Along the way there are a few of thier best known songs re-arranged for maximum unplugged potency. If you like what you have read so far in this review and decide to buy it, you might wear your Bluray player out with reviewings of this amazing concert. Please don't pass this one up.
