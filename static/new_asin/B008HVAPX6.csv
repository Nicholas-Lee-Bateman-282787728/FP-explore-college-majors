8528320,2,B008HVAPX6,"I was extremely disappointed with the production quality of this video. 1.  Inside the packaging was a plain silver disc, no writing or picture on it, looked just like the dvd copies I make at home;  2.  There is no menu, just put it in and fast forward to where you want to be. 3. Obviously an old production that looks like it was ""homemade"".  Veda can dance, but in my opinion, this video does not showcase her teaching talents.
Will not buy another of her DVD's",1392681600,,465,4.310344827586207
