8411524,1,B00400M3ZQ,This film is so dark that you can hardly see anything. Waste of money and worst film that I have ever bought.,1386288000,,109,4.0
8411525,1,B00400M3ZQ,"That was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Not only it leaves a lot to be desired in attractiveness by the producer Claude Peres. He is also a Huge male Borderline which made the experience for me like having my teeth pulled. ""I don't know if I like you. And I don't know if I don't like you"". "" I don't know if I find you attractive. I don't know if I don't find you attractive"". I bought this because supposedly it was a supposedly expilicit sexual content. Well that sexual content in addition to barely being explicit is really boring and annoying because the annoying producer won't stop talking and making stupid comments. I DO NOT recommend this at all. Rent a disney movie. You will get more enjoyment. This is pure trash!",1372204800,,740,4.369565217391305
8411526,3,B00400M3ZQ,Nice concept but no so interesting result. The premise sounds very interestimg but too many sections are too dark...I expected something more psycological and complex...just two guys talking and not very clear conclusions,1352678400,,221,5.7272727272727275
8411527,1,B00400M3ZQ,"Thank goodness I only rented this film because if I had bought it, I'd be furious. In fact, I'm upset that I wasted 90 minutes and $4 on this ""film"". Its about two men who have sex and film it - and most of it you can't see because the screen is either pitch black or the view of the actors is obstructed. Oh, one of the actors is nice enough to buy food during the film(gee, thanks!)

Please people, stay away from this.",1348963200,2,421,4.011904761904762
8411528,1,B00400M3ZQ,"Terrible movie. The producer hires Marcel Schlutt (model and actor) to have sex with him, records it and sells the footage. All in real life. Marcel Schlutt was the reason I bought the film because I had previously watched a movie with him, but was very disappointed. Could not even pass 30 min.",1341532800,2,295,4.584905660377358

8411530,4,B00400M3ZQ,"This movie has me baffled.  I liked it and again, I didn't.  The director says 'this is not porn'.  Two men, nude and having sex to completion and filming it, sort of borders on porn.  But again, they talk about the experience.  Would they do it again?  Both said 'yes'.  They talked of themselves and how they viewed sex.  They engaged in sensual touching, kissing and stopped to talk about it.  I did not like the beginning that was mostly in the dark when they just talked.  I mean literally a black screen with one of the guys smoking.  All you saw was the guy lighting either a cigarette or joint.  Sorry, it was dark, I couldn't see what it was!  I wanted that to be lighted just like the rest of the movie was.  It was distracting and I almost turned it off because it did not hold my attention.  If you can get past that, then you might enjoy, or not enjoy the film.  Would I watch it again?  No.  It left me cold and indifferent.  Even though they shared their feelings, it just did not click with me.  Here's the bottom line.  If you always wanted to see a porn film with talking and emotional journeys, this is for  you.  You can decide if it is porn or not.  To me, it was porn and it took too long to get to a climax.  I'd rather watch a Joe Gage film.  I give it 4 stars because I admire the director for taking a chance with this film.  I like people who take chances.",1291075200,16,1383,4.082397003745318
