1590595,5,B00005JNSR,"I have seen this film in Europe, and have recently obtained a DVD from England. It is an amazing film, and I was not even a Johnny Depp fan when I first viewed it. It is a moving tale of a man's love for his family and the desparate lengths he will take to ensure their future. I cried like a baby in some parts, especially when watching Depp as Raphael crying over his sleeping children, and when Raphael looks at his wife on a desert hillside as if seeing her for the first time. Depp is his usual brilliant self, and his physical beauty is overwhelming at times. I had become a fan of Depp after viewing ""The Man Who Cried"" in Europe, and ""The Brave"" solidified my feeling that Depp is an extraordinary actor, whose expressive face speaks volumes even when he is silent. This movie looks at an aspect of American poverty that is ignored by many, and brings home the point that running water is still a luxury to some Native Americans by showing Depp walking upstream to find cleaner water to bring home in old cans and jugs, held by a pole across his shoulders that evoked a distinct ""Christ on the Cross"" image, as he slips and struggles to carry the heavy load back to his shabby trailer. The young actors playing Raphael's children are simply wonderful and Elpidia Carrillo is stunning as his long-suffering wife. The only weak point of the movie was, strangely enough, the character played by Marlon Brando, who we briefly meet, listen to his strange ramblings, and wonder at his long, shaggy grey hair, then only see again for a second near the end of the movie. The ending left me in tears and rage, wanting to know more, yet somehow not wanting to realize that my fears for this man have come to pass. I can only hope that Johnny Depp decides to direct more movies, and that they be released in North America, as this is truly a great film that will remain in my emotions forever.",1112918400,5,1890,4.402857142857143
1590596,5,B00005JNSR,"Although this movie has yet to be release in the United States it has been in some places in Europe and in Hong Kong which is where I got my copy. This movie was filmed in 1997 and it marked Johnny Depp's directing debut which I believe he did a terrific job being his first time behind the camera. He also co-wrote the script with his brother.

This is a great film ( a little too slow perhaps at times) but nevertheless a very good movie. Johnny plays Raphael, a man with a wife and family to support in desperate need of a job. He has lost all hope and agrees to participate in a snuff film trading his life for a large sum of money so that his wife and two kids can lead a decent life. He strikes a deal with Marlon Brando (in a very small role) and has one week to live and spent every time possible with his family before he is to go back and participate in this horrible act that will eventually cause his demise.

The more pain he is able to withstand the more money his family will receive. I don't want to continue talking it about it because I would like for all of you to see it and decide for yourself if Rapahel did the right thing or not. He did it all for the love of his family and so that they live a better life since he was never able to give them much of anything.

The movie is somewhat dark and sad (obviously) and although I don't think this movie would do too well if it were to be release in theaters not because is not good but is kind of a depressing movie and it would not hold the interest of too many people I believe. Still I gave the movie five stars because I believe that Johnny Depp as well as the rest of the cast did a fantastic Job. Johnny especially was wonderful and managed to successfully pull off a great character study of a man on the brink of desperation only to save his family from leading a rather meaningless life without the hope of a brighter future.

Hopefully it won't be too long before this movie is release on DVD so that many people and all of the Depp fans which they are many can see this incredible movie. It is a movie not to be missed and Johnny Depp proves once again his incredible talent as an actor as well as a first time writer/director. When the movie is finally release on DVD get it right away you will like it a lot I think. Is not your average movie but with Johnny Depp in it who can complain NOBODY.",1107475200,55,2376,4.059701492537314

1590650,5,B00005JNSR,"""I regard death as a kind of necessary metamorphosis.  You see, there's pain when you come into the world at birth, so it seems fitting that there should be pain at the end of it...it is the final measure of bravery to stand up to death.""

These are some of the lines said by Marlon Brando as McCarthy in ""The Brave"" as he interviews Raphael(Johnny Depp) for his role in the snuff movie he will do so that his family will have enough money to escape their painful living conditions.

They are also some of the best lines I ever heard in any movie.  I am not sure if Depp himself wrote those lines, or his brother, or if they were merely taken from the book ""The Brave"" was based on.  But, chilling and scary as McCarthy's statements are--they clearly depict the cold, brutal reality which is a kind of living death many people in the world experience.  The example here in ""The Brave"" is the torment Raphael and his family endure as they struggle to make ends meet in a scrap dump located near a town in perhaps Arizona or New Mexico.  Prior to making the decision to give up his life in the snuff movie, Raphael often stole money for his family, which usually always landed him in jail where he would spend up to three years at times, away from his family.  Raphael also has a serious drinking problem that also caused him some jail time for ""drunken disorderly,"" and ""assault.""

It's a dark, broody film that apologizes for nothing, nor tries to underplay or downplay the emotions or the gritty reality.  It is what it is.  It may seem to some like a depressing tale, but it's also a story of pure, unadulterated love.  It's an inspiring portrait of one man's decision to die for his family in a last-ditch attempt to show them what they mean to him.  Even if he failed them miserably, in his eyes, at least they'll have enough money to get out of their painful situation and have a chance at a better future.  Otherwise, so thinks Raphael, they literally have no real hope of rising above their scrap-dump situation.

Once Raphael decides to give up his life so his family can have that chance--he finally begins to live.  He re-bonds with his son Frankie(Cody Lightning), whom he probably had a very turbulent relationship with earlier on.  Based on the beginning of the film with what I call the ""stare down"" between father and son--the tension is thicker than butter.  Young Frankie, bearing the long hair of a growing Native American brave, wears an arm cast, placed there perhaps because Raphael once beat him up in a fit of drunken rage.  It is not made clear in the movie whether this happened or not, but it's a subtle hint that is very chilling.  My guess is, if  Raphael did indeed beat his son, it was the first time he ever did that, and this was the final nail in the coffin, so to speak, which drove Raphael to want to die so that his family can live on without him.  A snuff movie, which would pay him money to die would be the perfect solution, so that at least he could leave behind a way out for his family, the best love he could ever give them, since he obviously failed at everything else.

Once he signs up for the snuff film and is paid a third of the fifty-thousand dollars McCarthy offers him, he goes out of his way to make it up to not only Frankie and his sister Marta, but Rita, his wife, as well.  Rita(played by Elpidia Carrillo) sees the scrap carnival Raphael has built for his kids, which he wakes the whole family up to see, and the first thing she thinks is--more burglary.  Rita is tired and fed up, her life with  Raphael a living hell that she must try to make work for the sake of her kids.  At the same time, her love for Raphael never died, as the memories of the first time they met and got together remain prominent in her mind.  As Rita says, when alone with Raphael as he tries to explain that he did not steal the money used to build the carnival--she's known him for years, before Raphael got taken in by liquor, robbing stores and going to jail.  ""The kids didn't get that father,"" Rita says, adding that they only got tastes of him.  At one point, Raphael tells her simply that he wants to provide for Rita and the two kids.  Rita's response is that if he wants to provide, he must love them first.  What she doesn't realize is that the next week with  Raphael will re-awaken not only her powerful love for him, but her happiness and passion, things she thought she lost a long time ago.  Ms. Carrillo, as Rita, is sensitive and sweet as well as tormented and sympathetic.  It's a stellar performance that made me really care about her.  In the documentary in the Special Features section of the DVD, Elpidia Carrillo exclaimed that Rita was just like her mother, as she grew up poor herself.  This obviously allowed her to make her role in ""The Brave"" even more real.  I wonder what she's doing now.  She's a wonderful actress.

Luiz Guzman, who plays Luiz, Raphael's former ""partner-in-crime"" is more of an actual ""villain"" in this movie than McCarthy is.  Guzman's performance gave me the chills.  He did, as Luiz, drop the F-bomb quite alot, but it's real life, after all, not glitzy Hollywood censorship which tries to downplay that word so that audiences are not too ""disturbed"" or ""off-put"" by it.  Luiz is a burglar and a druggie who managed to make some money to have a house and a car. People in that scrap-dump look to him as someone with a certain kind of ""success,"" and this makes Luiz feel important.  His pompous attitude mixed with a need to feel important and respected is all over Guzman's body language as well as the delivery of his lines.  You are meant to hate this guy.  He's not a nice person.  At the same time, you also see a glimmer of humanity in him as he confronts Depp's  Raphael during a party Raphael throws for the neighborhood with more of the third of fifty-thousand dollars.  Luiz tries to get Raphael to share some of his wealth, while stating that ""you're making me look bad in front of these people and these are  MY people.""  As pompous and threatening as this is, it also shows Luiz's helplessness in a situation where he once felt he and Raphael were  ""partners"" and ""bro's"" as they worked together in burglary.  Luiz takes a lot of credit for having  been there to help Raphael ""score"" with whatever store they decided to rob, for the most amount of money.  Another scene has Luiz speaking to Lou(Frederick Forrest, formerly Johnny Depp's boss in ""21 Jump Street""), and his wife Maria, Rita's sister, and their son,  Lou Jr. played by Max Perlich.  Luiz goes on about how Raphael ""held out"" on him by not including Luiz in what he assumes is a ""score,"" not a ""job"" as everyone in the neighborhood says.  It's known all over the dump that Raphael is trying to go straight.  Not only does Luiz not believe this, but Father Stratton, the priest played by Clarence Williams III, also is convinced that ""something smells funny.""

A powerful scene in the movie consists of Raphael making a confession to Father Stratton, telling him about his role in the snuff movie.  Raphael begs the priest to make sure that Rita and the kids get the money after Raphael is gone.  Raphael thinks that this priest, the only real honest person around, is the one person he can trust to do that.  Father Stratton is horrified, asking how Raphael can expect a priest to commit the carnal sin of helping someone commit suicide!  He says no to Raphael's pleas, but you can see the torment behind the decision.  It is powerful performance by Clarence Williams III, who, like Guzman and Carrillo, make you feel everything in his body language as well as his words.

The second-to-last actor I will mention here is Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman, who plays ""Papa,"" Raphael's father.  He does not have a lot of lines, but is in the movie a lot.  A particularly chilling scene has him talking to  Raphael about ""living with the spirits,"" and trying to teach Raphael that world when he was a child.  While it seemed to Papa at the time that Raphael didn't care, he now believes his son DOES care.  This is after a particularly heinous and gory scene which I will not spoil for you.  As Raphael sits at a bonfire contemplating his fate, Papa calls upon the Native American spirits to be with Raphael while he meditates with them.  The scene is an amazingly powerful one with yet another father and son reconnecting--just when the son is ready to leave the earth.  Papa's final bit of sage advice to Raphael is 'whatever you do, think of the children first.""  You can see in Raphael's eyes the very reason for his terrible decision to die--so that his son will not grow up to be just like he was, nor will his daughter end up in the hands of people like  Luiz, who also pays whores to entertain him on a regular basis.

Last, but certainly not least, is Marlon Brando.  What can be said about him that hasn't been said already?  The man is a master at his craft.  Depp, in the ""special features,"" documentary, said that there was no way he could actually direct Brando...he just allowed him to work his magic on his one speaking scene, those stellar lines mentioned at the beginning of this review.  Brando's approach to McCarthy's philosophy of death is so human, even as he speaks of doing evil things.  You definitely feel an ambiguous sort of sympathy for him.  On his desk is a picture of a woman who might have been McCarthy's wife or daughter, perhaps.  You know that McCarthy has seen enough death NOT at his hands, to eventually lead him to take lives himself, while claiming that dying ""leaves behind the greatest gift that anyone can give another--which is the courage to face death.""

I got this movie imported from a seller in Japan.  It was advertised as workable on every DVD player.  I do not see that particular version available anymore, which makes me feel blessed to have gotten my copy!  This plays beautifully on my computer, and while I never tried to play it on a DVD player itself, it should probably work just fine based on the advertisement.  Nevertheless I was grateful to see this amazing film by, in my view, one of the most innovative actors of all time--Johnny Depp.  I had to see what he did as a director, and a writer.  I just had to see it for myself, as I knew that Johnny decided not to release the film in the United States, largely based on one critic's slashing of the movie after the premiere.

Based on my review of the above actors, I hope I gave a sneak preview of Depp's wonderful directing abilities.  He really brought the film to life while helping the actors create the characters  effectively.  When I wasn't shedding tears, I was cheering at certain triumphant moments, or gritting my teeth at whatever injustices these people dealt with.  As an actress myself, I am in theater, local theater.  I'm not in Hollywood like Johnny is, but in 2008 I set out to direct a play I wrote myself, one that I also acted in.  It was one of the most stressful, most tormented experiences of my life. Like  Depp with ""The Brave,' I had never directed before.  Were it not for the cast and crew of my play who believed in the project and stepped up with support and helpful guidance, I think that I and the play would have fallen flat on our faces.  The ""team effort"" of everyone involved actually enabled me to realize a pretty good result. This said, I thoroughly relate to  Johnny's assertion when discussing ""The Brave"" that he should be ""committed to an institution for even thinking I could get away with this.""  Those words could have come right from my lips when discussing my own attempt.  So, from one directer/actor to another, different worlds aside, I can greatly sympathize with everything Johnny must have gone through while putting this passion project of his together.  This, in addition to being attracted to the story and loving  Johnny's work in general(and  Marlon Brando's), made me seek out this film and buy it.

I am so glad I did!!!  We are always our own worst critics, and Depp is as human as I am, celebrity or no.  I understand and sympathize with his decision not to release this film in the States, but again, I hope he reconsiders at some point.  He really did wonderful work as a director and writer.  His acting, as well, was some of the best work I have ever seen him do.  Which is saying a lot!

NOTE: I do a lot of quoting the film here.  I do not own the copyrights at all, nor do I claim any ownership,  I merely want to give people a taste of what they will see when they watch the movie.  That said, I hope my quotes do not offend--merely show Depp's abilities as a writer and director as well as an actor.  To me, the lines are pure genius!",1441756800,2,12679,4.452256944444445

1590688,5,B00005JNSR,"The only film Johny Depp wrote and directed is a very, VERY good albeit incredibly shocking and terminally DARK opus. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

Raphael (Johny Depp) is a recently out of jail American Indian. Unemployed, he lives with his wife Rita (Elpidia Carrillo) and two young children in a dirt poor small community near a rubbish dump. As most of people (mostly Indians) living there, he earns his - very miserable - living by scavenging through the dump and selling whatever he can find. Ashamed by his inability to correctly take care of his family and deeply humiliated by his situation, Raphael is a greatly desperate man and therefore also an easy target.

Indeed one day a strange and very unpleasant man named Larry (Marshall Bell) contacts him and brings him to a sinister place, where awaits an even stranger and scarier character, a certain McCarthy (Marlon Brando). This man will make Raphael an unusual, shocking and completely illegal offer - maybe not exactly an offer he cannot refuse, but certainly one that can not be accepted easily... In fact, McCarthy, who is a quasi-luciferian figure, offers him a quasi-faustian deal... And then the film really begins.

Adapted remotely from a novel published in 1991 by American mystery writer Gregory MacDonald, this is a very good film, but it is also one of the most deeply disturbing, shocking, bleak and dark things I ever saw! Honestly, it is one the same level of shocking as ""Seven""!

Johny Depp, who never directed anything before or since, proved here that he definitely CAN make a film, not only star in it. He wanted to make a film about the bleakest misery, the deepest despair and the most abject depravation - and he succeeded so well, that when watching this film I almost could smell the rot, decay and corruption which gnaws at people's bodies and souls...

Surprisingly, American critics destroyed this film so comprehensively that it was impossible to find a distributor who would release it in USA - and in Old Europe the reception was hardly better. I cannot really comprehend this...

I will keep this review short to avoid any temptation of giving more spoilers, because this thing deserves to be discovered entirely by yourself.

I canot say that I liked this thing and you will certainly not enjoy it (if you do, go urgently see a doctor!) but it is nevertheless a GREAT AND UNIQUE FILM, very much worth discovering. It's just that after watching it you will probably need to go hug somebody - or have a solid shot of vodka - and maybe also take a long, long hot shower...",1392076800,,2601,4.766666666666667

The plot moved too slow for me and the characters lacked depth.  Time spent on scenary and characters that did not matter could have been used growing the relationships that really mattered.  I love me some Johnny Depp and if he had not been in pretty much the whole thing, I would not know how this ended.

Pretty much like a lot of Native Americans because of the living conditions we gave them. It is about what the main character is willing to do to make his families life better.

Being a long time film buff I tend to gravitate toward art house, independent films and other off beat films because American Blockbuster type movies tend to be very predictable...i.e. HAPPY AND PREDICTABLE ENDINGS.  They also are usually geared toward the audience that will spend the most money at the box office (PG-13) plus the big studios and production companies limit the director's artistic vision.
Having that said,  this film was more than I thought I would be (at the expense of being redundancy).

But overall, the movie is a dramatic presentation of a bleak and depressing story--a down-and-out family man who is unable to provide for his family any other way than selling his body to make a snuff film. Depp's comment was that we all say we would die for our loved ones, but would we really? I live near where the movie was filmed, and recognized some of the background shots, including the four-horse merry-go-round made from metal barrels. Was interesting to see the ""brave"" symbol in the context of the movie, which Depp had tattooed on his arm.  The Native American bits were very good. I certainly prefer this movie over, say, ""Blow,"" or ""Donnie Brasco,"" both of which were exquisitely acted, but again, very depressing stories.

1590818,5,B00005JNSR,"The film is an unvarnished portrayal of life on the edge and, although it has been regarded as Depp's tribute to the  contemporary Native American, it explores the universal theme of devotion to family and the lengths to which a man might go to be a provider in our money-driven society. The film feels deeply, if not painfully, personal for Depp, It was dismissed at Cannes and never distributed in the US. This copy is from China or Japan but not dubbed so you can enjoy the original English. Depp plays a desperate young Native American, Rafael, who choses be hired for snuff film in order to provide an escape from poverty for his wife and children. It up to the viewer to decide if the choice is noble or cowardly. ""The Brave"" is Depp's only role (thus far) as both director and actor and as such an important part of any collection of his work.",1360540800,,850,4.448717948717949

1590824,4,B00005JNSR,"I loved this film and thought Johnny Depp was wonderful. If you are a fan of his then you will enjoy this film. However, a word of warning. I bought this film as a Korean copy because I didn't know of another way to get it, but after watching it I discovered that about 30 minutes of the film was missing. It should run around 2 hours, but after buying 2 different Korean versions both ran at around 1 hour and 30 minutes. I'm not sure whether all the Korean copies have this flaw, but after the two I tried I'm not hopeful. So be aware that this could be a problem with the Korean region 1 copy of the Brave. However, the 90 minutes of the Brave that I did see on my faulty disc was awesome and Johnny Depp rocked.

Watching him prepare himself to face his death for the disturbing entertainment of others, with the promise of $50,000 to be given to his family afterwards.

1590875,5,B00005JNSR,"In my opinion this is just a superb movie. It's a shame it wasn't better received by the critics, otherwise more people may have gotten a chance to see it. It's a movie that is powered more by emotion than action, although there is some action, & I think that emotions are much harder for an actor to get across than it would be if he were just the gun toting hero shooting people. Johnny Depp is a master at bringing emotions to the surface & he does it brilliantly in this movie. You can look at his face, even if it's stone blank, & know just what he's thinking & feeling. The more times I see it the more I fall in love with it. There are some scenes that are so beautifully done, mostly just dialog, but the emotions that are behind the words are so powerful that you can't help but be drawn into it & actually start feeling yourself what the characters are feeling. The music is beautiful too and really helps to set the tone of the movie, it stays in your head long after the movie is over. This is one movie I'll definitely watch over & over in the future & probably one of Johnny's best performances.",1193443200,2,1109,4.186915887850467
1590876,1,B00005JNSR,"Let's for a moment pretend that Depp's character Raphael, from the Italian tribe of course, is a strip of wallpaper. One day this wallpaper decides it's not good enough for the house anymore and gets in touch with an interior decorator, played by Marlon Brando in a convincing turn as Jabba the Hut sans special effects, who eventually sets this strip of wallpaper on fire in a fit of sadistic glee. But you literally have to watch the wallpaper glue dry for an hour or so before you go from the old batch to the new batch. You never even actually see the new wallpaper gracing the walls; perhaps our evil home decorator skips town without ever installing it. But isn't that just like life? And I'm sure that's what Depp was trying to tell us with this coma-inducing treat. So buckle up and move on to the next review.",1184976000,3,818,4.46
1590917,5,B00005JNSR,"This film is dark and moody and very beautiful, in a harrowing, make-you-think-and-feel sort of way. It haunted me for days after watching it. Be sure you are in the proper mood to watch it; it will NOT cheer you up. (Unless watching REALLY screwed up lives helps you feel better about yours, which is valid.)

Other reviews have already covered much of the plot, so I'll make a few detailed comments. First off, Iggy Pop did the score, so that's just cool. Also, I loved, loved Clarence Williams III (Linc from the Mod Squad!) as the family priest. The scene he has with Raphael in the confessional is masterful. He ends up wrestling with his own moral dilemma, though it's not quite as awful as Depp's character faces. One visual thing that comes to mind is the gorgeous, blood-red sunset right after Raphael and his wife have made love in the desert. It's probably the only colorful thing we see in the whole movie. This one image says so much about the beauty of the week he's just had, as well as what awaits him.  I found it effective, and one of many nice touches from a first-time director. And then there's Raphael's heart-wrenching walk up those stairs at the end. I was gutted.

I like most of the changes made in adapting the screenplay from the novel.  Especially having Raphael's son be older so their reconnection is more meaningful. And I liked the fantasy, artsy, sculpture of lights he creates for everyone. (A bit more whimsical than a big screen TV, no?) The novel is even darker than the film, with an even bleaker ending and a chapter (describing EXACTLY what Raphael will endure) so disturbing that even the author suggests you may want to skip it. (A good idea if you are at all squeamish.) THOSE images stayed with me WAY longer than I would have liked. I was thankful they chose to leave it out of the movie. Our imaginations (and that final walk!) are disturbing enough.

It's my understanding that Depp decided not to release this in the US for a few reasons. The reactions the film got at Cannes were very mixed, and for whatever reason, the American critics were particularly cruel, and rather personal, about their dislike for it. Also it's obviously not the sort of film that would appeal to a broad American audience. Too stark, too much talk, too much to think about, (too much truth?), too little action, etc. If you can pretend you're in France, you may love it.

Anyway, it's a moving film for the right person in the right frame of mind. I'll definitely watch it again--on my computer--when I'm in the proper mood. (OK, so WHY is there a limit on the number of times you can switch formats on your DVD drive? Is that fascist, or what?)",1184284800,,2673,4.535269709543568
1590918,5,B00005JNSR,"This was a dark and troubled story but no worse than the lives of many NDN people who live as wards of the state on federal reservations..... the hopelessness that drove Raphael to do what he did pervades the NDN people on the rez - resulting in the high rates of alcoholism and suicide.  I see where Johnny was going with this, and applaud him for his feeling portrayal.  Aho Johnny Depp",1157414400,2,388,4.375
1590919,5,B00005JNSR,"During my tenure as a Creative Executive for Oliver Stone's Ixtlan Productions, I read and fell in love with this deep and insightful screenplay.  It was truly iconoclastic and had the makings of a powerful film about the sometimes harsh reality of life in America.  Amidst the downbeat sentiment resonated the true majesty of love and the undying belief that faith and sacrifice begets change, though in this case, at a mighty cost.  I tried with every fiber of my being to get our company involved in this project but my passion fell on deaf ears.  I truly regret that this deeply affecting piece of material never received the attention it truly deserved.  Sadly, there is a tragic story involving a producer who took his life as a result of the trials and tribulations he faced in attempting to bring such a bold and controversial piece to the screen - clear evidence of the overwhelming dynamics that this material embodies.  One can only hope that God has embraced this mans soul and brought peace and enlightenment to his family and friends...  The Brave is both a wonder and wonderful.  Seek it out and let it wash over you.  You, too, will be cleansed by its stunning beauty.",1150329600,7,1184,4.681159420289855
1590920,1,B00005JNSR,"A sad, supremely wasted effort...and I like Depp as an actor and a person.

Gregory McDonald's slim novel is one of the most harrowing, dark works of fiction I've ever come across. The chapter describing the Uncle's interview of The Brave is nearly unbearable. You can check out the amazon reviews of the book itself if you are interested. Even the one star review of the book is right on the mark...this is deep, tragic story and certainly not for everybody

Under the right hands, the film could very well have been a masterpiece of dark dramatic American cinema. Unfortunately, Depp has handed in a total mess, an unrecognizable vanity project, best left forgotten. Marlon Brando is embarrassing in a role that should have run chills up the back of even the most hardened critic. Depp's version of The Brave is even a lowlier and sillier work than the formulaic and forgettable 8mm with Nicolas Cage...a difficult task.

Paul Shrader could have made this the film it should have been, but he has already mined this territory in the exceptional film ""Hardcore"" (5 stars, go see it if you are inclined to see a depressing movie about the underbelly of America circa 1979).

The film needed documentary grittiness to convey the tragedy of Raphael, not Depp's ham-handed black humor and magic realism.",1146096000,2,1300,4.842342342342342

It's moving, sad, and disturbing. Very well put together. Brando's character was chilling and he was excellent, as well as Depp's performance. Not bad for a first time director. This movie showed how very real poverty in our country is, the frustration of trying to get by, and a huge sacrifice a man was willing to make for his family. This is definitely a must see. Needs to be released in the U.S.",1127692800,19,575,4.485714285714286
1590922,4,B00005JNSR,"Well, I got this DVD from ebay, but unfortunately it doesn't work in either of my DVD players.  I did watch it on my computer, however.  It turned out to be an excellent movie!
It is very well-done...Depp's acting and directing is remarkable.  This is an extremely emotional movie, and I'm betting that Raphael's life is a parallel of Johnny Depp's life.

Raphael (Depp) and his family are exceedingly poor.  This is a huge obstacle since Raphael would do absolutely anything for his family...even die.  In the beginning, he finds a snuff film maker (Marlon Brando).  For those who don't know, a snuff film is a film in which an actual murder is filmed for entertainment in a movie.  Anyway, Raphael agrees to do it.  He has one week before he is scheduled to die, but he will be paid $50,000.  From this point on, many things happen.  He builds a junkyard fair for his two children.  He re-falls in love with his wife and kids.  People are suspicious of his sudden large income.  His home will be destroyed.  Threats, murder, jealousy, and every emotion possible...all in the last 7 days of his life.  And it is all for his love for his family.

It really is a beautiful story.  Sad, but beautiful.  Yes, perhaps it is a bit crazy to commit suicide just so your family can have money, but that's what love does to you.  It makes you crazy. The only reason I gave it 4(1/2) instead of 5 stars is because the beginning was a little slow.  Also, there is a lot of blood and the F word, but then again it is rated R.  Besides that, I would say Depp's movie is a huge success.  I guarantee that anyone who watches this will be moved.",1123459200,10,1629,4.374581939799331

I  must have tuned in just a few minutes into the beginning and I was surprised to see Depp and Brando perform in a movie I haven't heard off. Waiting to drift into sleep, I decided to watch a few sequences, but soon enough I got caught in this overall dark and impressive atmosphere of great storytelling, acting, and directing, unknowing that it was Depp's directing. Never really cared much about him, since good acting alone doesn't make him stand out from the sleek (Hollywood)crowd. But this one is deep. A masterpiece.

1590926,5,B00005JNSR,"The story revolves around a Native American Indian (Depp), who lives in poverty with his family and other Native American families in a scrapyard, miles away from the nearest town. The area may be Arizona or New Mexico, judging by the fact that many Native Americans listen to Spanish music, radio, tv, etc. He decides to be tortured to death in a ""snuff"" film and in return, his family will get $50,000 and will be able to live a better life. In the last 7 days he has to live, he spends as much time with his family as he can. In those 7 days, we chart Johnny's activities, his relationship with his wife and kids, with his friends, a couple of unfortunate encounters with the man who will torture him and his visit to the local church. I know, it may not sound very interesting but this film needs to be watched uninterrupted, with the right frame of mind and you need to have a good attention span. If you can appreciate fine acting and a film which elicits a very strong emotional response, then this would be the ideal film for you. I believe that it's the American public's loss that this film is not available on Reg 1.

What can I say about this film other than it's a masterpiece? The acting is so intense and the characters so believeable and completely in despair, that you genuinely feel heart-broken for them. I especially loved the first 5-10 minutes of the film, with beautiful music but no actual dialogue. For example, Johnny Depp is looking at his son in bed and his son is looking right back at him. It is such a powerful moment where not a single solitary word is uttered but it's almost as if they are communicating with one another telepathically.

It's as if both of them have a moment of clarity and just know that something awful is going to happen to their family. This film is about relationships, belief and sacrifice. It's certainly not a film for the mainstream audiences. So, if you are looking for action, explosions, car chases, plenty of swearing, gore, scares, etc you'll be disappointed and I suggest you look elsewhere. This film is a slow-paced drama which explores the concepts of marriage and, more importantly, life and death.",1113091200,17,2168,4.542199488491049
