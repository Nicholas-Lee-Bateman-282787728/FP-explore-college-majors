8204142,5,B000S2XD90,"I saw this amazing documentary this morning and it reaffirmed a theory I have had for several years.

Marlon Brando is to blame for the Reality Based television genre.

The universe maintains a certain balance. Fossil fuels have generated enormous power for close to a century. Now we suffer from the pollution which was a by-product of the energy.

Marlon Brando was a force of nature that redefined acting so completely that acting was never the same. He so transformed himself in each role and physically aquired every nuance of the character that Marlon Brando disappeared and Terry Malloy or Don Corleone etc. were in front of us as real fully developed human beings.

For better or worse, I say ""for better"" Brando's emergence made us all painfully aware that everyone else is ""acting"" and Brando is doing something else altogether.

Brando's talent served as a role model for dozen's of excellent artists hoping to match his talents like DeNiro, Pacino, Penn, Day-Lewis, Eric Roberts, Ed Norton and my personal favorite Mickey Rourke.

These are the good and interesting by products of Brando's presence.

The pollution that resulted from Brando's power is reality TV. After watching Brando and the others that followed him acting rose to the level that it was in essence reality. There was no where else entertainment could go.

The only thing more ""real"" than a Brando performance was reality itself. As an artist Brando used his skill to shape a wide variety of interesting human beings and demonstrated their pain and sacrifice.

In order to get the same level of emotional intensity we now must stick a camera in some poor fool's house who is being raided by ""Cops"" or force people to ""Survive"" on a desert island and eat rats, or force teenagers that dislike each to live together and call it the ""Real World"".

Where is the art and creativity in this?

Back to this documentary... It is amazing and I hope it is available soon. Watching this is like being in the room when Van Gogh was choosing colors or when Kafka was sitting in a cafe describing a new short story he had written. By far the best documentary on Brando.",1238716800,6,2135,4.7588075880758804
8204143,5,B000S2XD90,"I too, like many of the other reviewers, first saw this on
Turner Classic Movies last year when it first aired.
I absolutely loved it and feel like the Brando fan will get
a clearer picture into what this iconoclastic actor was about!
Of course, as complex a person as Brando was, there is no way
that we will know the full picture!
Great interviews with Pacino, Depp, Robert Duval, James Caan,
etc. sharing great stories and insights along the way.
The only problem is that the powers that be are dragging
their butts on releasing this to DVD!!---What's the hold up?",1207958400,8,567,4.568627450980392
8204144,5,B000S2XD90,"I too saw this documentary last summer through OnDemand, after it aired on TCM, and I fell in love with it immediately. I went to the TCM website to see if the DVD was available, and I even signed a petition to get it released to DVD as soon as possible.

I was really looking forward to this DVD being released in October of 2007 (especially since my birthday is here and it's at least one DVD that I could ""hold out for"" as a birthday gift), and now it appears that I have to wait until I'm THIRTY-SIX to get it.

I agree: this has to be a typo (the 2010 release date). I called a retail store the day before it was scheduled to be released and they were forthright enough to say that it wasn't scheduled to arrive, but that they'd call me when it did, as they anticipated it ""slipped under the radar"". I haven't heard from them since.

""Radar"" my ""streetcar"".

I'm disappointed that one of the best documentaries I've seen in the last few years isn't making its way onto DVD. Perhaps if TCM aired it again (and there is no mention of it on the November schedule--I've already checked), it would generate more interest.

Sadly...",1193270400,11,1131,4.316037735849057
8204145,5,B000S2XD90,"I saw this documentary on TCM and thought it was a fascinating look at Marlon Brando.  Loaded with footage from his films and commentary by many Hollywood stars who've worked with him, it's a must own.  I must say I'm rather puzzled by the 2010 release date.  I've read on other DVD release date sites that this documentary is being released on DVD 10/09/07.  Come on, Amazon.  If that is the proper release date, make the correction so I can pre-order this!",1186963200,11,458,4.536585365853658
8204146,5,B000S2XD90,Excellent documentary. Brando gives much information without getting psychologically involved with its subject. It's up to the viewer to put the pieces together and to read and learn more about this fascinating and enigmatic character. What a disappointment that it will probably not make its way onto dvd. Legal dispute over content I heard.,1184025600,6,342,5.351851851851852
8204147,5,B000S2XD90,"Surely this can't be right? Preorder now and wait 3 years? This has gotta be a misprint, no? A little clarification or correction perhaps?",1183852800,5,138,4.791666666666667
