Blood Monkey - of the three, this one is probably the least bad.  Some college kids (annoying stereotypes all) go into the jungle for some sort of internship.  They meet up with a mad scientist who is researching a huge type of gorilla.  Er, monkey.  Mad scientist uses the kids as bait to draw the monkeys in so he can attempt to capture one.  The scientist was pretty good, really crazy and devoted to his work.  The kids started out annoying, but by the midpoint of the movie they they weren't so bad any more.  The monkeys are bad CGI and the ending is ripped off straight from Blair Witch Project.  3/5.

Maneater - some really religious kid is threatened by a big tiger or something.  I couldn't watch this, it just didn't interest me at all.

In the Spider's Web - some people are hiking through the jungle, one of them gets bitten by a spider, and the rest of the group manages to track down Lance Henricksen, the local witch doctor, to hopefully cure her.  Unfortunately Lance is involved in some shady dealings involving selling body parts on the black market, and the hikers are on this list of victims.  Mostly we get a couple of the hikers, a guy and a moderately sexy girl, trying to rescue the girl's best friend from some cave.  After spending the whole movie going through one adventure after another together, they finally rescue the other woman and the moderately sexy girl happily leaves her male friend stranded, sure to die.  Yeah, gotta like her a lot - not!

Anyhow, these movies are for fans of B movies only.  I'm a huge fan of B movies, and I don't even think these are very good.  If you could get all three at a bargain basement price, they might be worth picking up.  But this isn't a bargain basement price, so I would recommending giving them a pass.",1232928000,,1897,4.440579710144927
