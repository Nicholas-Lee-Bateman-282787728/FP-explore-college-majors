6080898,5,B00GKEJMQS,"Must see for Jackie Stewart, F1 fans. It is cool to see Monaco in the 70's. The cars look and sound awesome. Plenty of race footage.",1402272000,,132,4.115384615384615
6080899,4,B00GKEJMQS,"Weekend of a Champion is a 1971 documentary, produced by car racing fan Roman Polanski, of world champion driver Jackie Stewart as he attempted to win the Monaco Grand Prix. Polanski and director Frank Simon were given unlimited access to Stewarts world for three days, both on the track and off. The documentary provides a look at a gifted athlete at the height of his powers.

Stewart is talkative and charming. Surprising is the fact that he suffers from extreme dyslexia; he never could learn how to read. Made well before documentaries took off in general audience popularity, Weekend of a Champion provides a time-capsule glimpse of the racing world in the early 70s.

The film doesn't have the polish of more recent documentaries, but is nonetheless a neat behind-the-scenes look at a sport that would become increasingly popular through the years.

The only bonus extra on the unrated DVD release is a theatrical trailer.",1401494400,12,929,4.980645161290322
6080900,1,B00GKEJMQS,"Give me a break - Polanski is a convicted and admitted pediophile.  He is a fugitive from justice hiding in France.  Lest you forget he drugged, sodomized and raped a 14 year old girl he was supposed to be auditioning for a role in a film.

There is no way I would put a penny in his pocket.  Stewart should be ashamed of himself participating in anything Polanski does.

And, shame on Amazon for offering his films.",1401408000,4,416,4.35064935064935
6080901,4,B00GKEJMQS,I really loved the footage. Jackie Stewart's explanation of car physics and how to go faster was great. If you love vintage racing footage you'll love this movie. It was very cool that Roman Polanski and Stewart were together in the same hotel room some 40 plus years later to talk about how racing and formula one driver safety has changed for the better. I'd you like formula one you'll really like this movie.,1401235200,5,412,4.581081081081081
6080902,5,B00GKEJMQS,"Either this was nicely restored or the original print was great. It far exceeded my quality and content expectations.

I'm very much interested in, and have studied this period of sports car and F1 racing, so I was delighted to hear about this film being released and it didn't disappoint.  Jackie Stuart's book, Faster, written in the same period paints a much less likable portrait of the man and the driver. This movie made him appear appealing, likable and human. And the discussion with Stewart and Polanski at the end is kind of a delight.  So sad though to see all of the people who lost their lives to the sport in the immediate months after the running of this race. But also great to see Fangio, Chiron, Moss very much alive and well, in period.

Highly recommended if you're interested in the subject matter and / or period. Probably not the least bit watchable if you (or your friends / loved ones) aren't.",1401062400,6,918,4.579268292682927
6080903,5,B00GKEJMQS,"This film is a great opportunity to spend time with one of F1's greatest drivers for a Monaco Grand Prix Weekend.

6080904,1,B00GKEJMQS,Not a feature film.  Not a documentary.  Not much of anything really. Single camera home movie type footage spliced together badly.

6080911,5,B00GKEJMQS,"This is a must have for the true race fan. Historical, world class racing at its best and filmed on location at Monaco. An intimate, behind the scenes look at the great Jackie Stewart and the mental and physical preparation required to be a champion. An incredibly dangerous time to be racing because of the power of the cars and lack of safety in all forms. Stewart negotiates the streets of Monaco at speed with poise and precision.

The cars, the fashion, the atmosphere - this video reeks of nostalgia and is really pretty awesome if you're an F1 fan. Jackie Stewart is an absolute legend. To learn about how he broke into F1, and how he came from literally less than nothing to become a world renowned icon is really captivating. Buy it.",1462147200,,367,4.492537313432836

6080915,5,B00GKEJMQS,"This film does for F1 racing what George Will's book ""Men at Work"" did for baseball. We get a deep look into Stewart (Jackie, not Tony), the master racer and the man, which is made even more poignant by the epilogue conversation between him and Polanski as old men, looking back after several decades. We also learn much about the Monaco Grand Prix, which is just as iconic and unique now as it was then. And the glorious cars are worth watching just for themselves. Any fan of historic racing or any era of F1 will love this video. It's worth buying, as a fan will watch it many times over.",1459209600,,591,4.333333333333333

6080919,5,B00GKEJMQS,"Step back into 1971, the tail end of ""the golden age of formula one"", and relive the jewel in the crown of Grand Prix racing, the Monaco Grand Prix. This doc is part profile of Jackie Stewart, at the peak of his dominance in racing, and part pure racing lesson given by the Great Scott himself. Pay attention! On a table cloth with a patty of butter, Stewart gives you the secret to winning at Monte Carlo. You get a close up view of not only the circus that was racing in that era, but a real time capsule of the glamorous life that was (and to a large part, still is) Monaco. But make no mistake, this is a racing doc with no fake drama or cheesy story line and shows the grit, hard work, and anxiety that both drivers and crews alike endured. One last thing, at the beginning of the film, Stewart gives us a lap at speed, in the rain of the Monaco circuit, which, by itself, is worth the price of the DVD.",1452729600,2,908,4.106741573033708

6080921,5,B00GKEJMQS,"in 1971 I was a mechanic and weekend crew chief for a small company that fielded a set of Formula Fords in Germany. For this particular race I was supposed to be a mechanic for one of the F3 teams who raced before the actual GP race. In this movie Jackie gives critique on their driving skills at the beginning of the movie. In my case, the driver's skills were so poor that he wrecked the transporter, the trailer AND the car itself on the outskirts of Marseille, so he never made it to the race itself, and I ended up doing a marathon driving stint to bring all of the damaged equipment back to Germany. The racing business was very unsafe back then as Jackie himself notes in the movie, and it wasn't much better in the pits or the lesser Formula Classes. Often by simply waiting, an aspiring driver would be offered a ride as the attrition rate of drivers was a steady thing. The movie is terrific because it is devoid of the bad editing, the horrible acting often found in race car movies, and also shows how overblown formula I has become. Just note how efficient Ken Tyrell is in the pits, he uses very few mechanics (who were very poorly paid back then), and does the timekeeping bit by himself. I would guess that Ken was extremely adept at managing stress and had a terrific team worker personality. Just a fantastic movie.",1446076800,5,1333,4.40080971659919

6080928,4,B00GKEJMQS,"I'm a lifelong fan of Jackie Stewart and watched him race in F1 as well as in the L&M Lola, a 1000hp monster at Mid Ohio track in 1971. He was always a hero of mine and this movie gave me additional insight to the man. 4 Stars because the production leaves a little bit to be desired. It was a good idea, but technically a little less than probably could have been achieved. Definitely worth a view.",1432944000,,399,4.128205128205129

F1 was a high level club racing, not the unapproachable machine of today.  To me this was very affordable and enjoyable nostalgia.",1420243200,,375,5.131147540983607

6080946,4,B00GKEJMQS,"very interesting for people like me fascinated with that era of motor racing.  Plus there is a scene between jackie stewart and francois cevert where he is telling the young driver to be gentle with the car, maybe select a higher gear, to make transitions less abrupt, to drive slowly and thus go fast that is a moment of connection, almost a love scene that is a credit to Roman Polanski the film maker rather than the documentarian.",1412640000,,434,4.564102564102564

6080949,4,B00GKEJMQS,"Yes, I'd say this met my expectations. I wanted to see a little bit of everything from the '71 Monte Carlo Grand Prix. And I was rewarded as such beyond expectations.

 For instance, I never expected to see Jackie Stewart in his white underwear briefs, with Roman Polanski at the breakfast table, completely oblivious to being labelled a swanky hedonist, discussing the finer points of the Monte Carlo course on the morning of the final race. Anything more {or less} might have found Jackie competing for the coveted  ""Palm De Fig Leaf"" against the likes of Johnny Wad or a young Ron Jeremy.

So in answer, I'd say that ""Weekend Of  A Champion"" is definitely beyond expectations.

All that aside, this is a great film of F1 '71.",1411430400,,728,4.6484375

Filmed over the weekend of the 71 Monaco GP Roman follows Jackie as he prepares for, races in, and wins the F1 GP.

Its a film made by a friend of a friend, its almost amateur in nature, but because of that I think it is even better as a result.

Interesting listening to Stewart coach Francois Cevert, and to hear him describe the F3 drivers lines ... you really get an insight into
his talent.",1410825600,,481,4.095744680851064

This documentary provides a wonderful and candid window to see Jackie in his racing prime, and in the process also gives us a fascinating view of F1, Monte Carlo, other drivers, their significant others, and much else during those days.  Fascinating to see what's changed and what's stayed the same since then.

6080960,5,B00GKEJMQS,"This DVD arrived a few days ago, and I can't stop watching it. Over the past few days I have been unable to take it out of my DVD player, and I have now watched it three times.

This is my all-time favorite racing movie, documentary or otherwise. If you are a fan of 1960s - 1970s Formula 1 racing, then you absolutely need to have this DVD in your collection. It chronicles Jackie Stewart's weekend at Monte Carlo with the new Tyrell F1 car. Jackie and team-owner Ken Tyrell were just coming off a year suffering through using the new March F1 car. Ken had decided to build his own F1 car, and this was one of the earliest outings of the car.

The film follows Jackie practicing the car in the dry, then in the rain, and follows the uncertainty of what the weather might produce over the weekend. The car was fast in the dry, but slow in the wet. What would race day bring? Jackie's uncertainties and insecurities are fully chronicled.

All the grand prix greats are included: Moss, Fangio, Graham Hill, Louis Cheron, as well as contemporary drivers like Jackie's team-mate Francois Cevert, Denis Hulme, Reine Wisell and Ronnie Peterson.

As a fan of that era, I could not ask for a better documentary of my boyhood idol Jackie Stewart. Polanski follows Stewart through the weekend and shows Jackie's insecurities, his private thoughts and ultimately his determination to win, no matter what.

The movie is great, but the best part may be the coda just added where Jackie and Roman are reunited in the same hotel room at Monaco. They talk about the changes made in F1 racing over the years, the drivers that perished, the safety improvements that have come about, and Jackie's driving style.

Again, if you are a fan of Jackie Stewart or F1 racing in the late 1960s and early 1970s, then you will not be disappointed with this DVD. This is a valued addition to my collection. Production values are quite good, editing is superb (contrary to what other reviewers have said) and I would not hesitate to buy this DVD again.",1405641600,12,2021,4.569060773480663

6080962,5,B00GKEJMQS,Awesome movie! I watched this the same weekend as the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix so it was good to see how the race used to look compared to the way it is today.  The additional footage of Sir Jackie Stewart and Roman driving the streets today and pointing out the differences was very interesting.  I recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in the history of Formula One.,1404777600,,381,4.428571428571429
6080963,5,B00GKEJMQS,"Excellent Video!!!
brings back so many memories. How Monaco has not changed and how it has changed so much.
St. Devote, Casino, hairpin (no Lowes), short tunnel, the old chicane, no swiming pool, Rascasse only another hairpin bring an image that somehow has not changed after 34 years.
What has dramatically changed: pits by the race track, spectators next to the track and no fences, side walks at the edge of the track, safety crews, pit stops, changing tires, etc.
The insights from Jackie are amazing.
Seen people like Jo Siffert, Graham Hill, Pedro Rodriguez, Francois Cevert, Reine Wissel, priceless.

But it was also a time of new developments and new approaches by drivers that changed F1 into what it later became. Jacky Stewart is one of those drivers that helps shape F1, that boosted interest in safety. But he's also just a competitor and a likeable guy.
