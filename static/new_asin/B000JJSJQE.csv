2673119,4,B000JJSJQE,"Recently, I gave my father three DVDs for his birthday.  Just one DVD would have come off as cheap, so several was the ticket.  It is great that movies can come in bundles so that you can do less shopping.
I'm a Black male and it's my two cents that Black women would just love, love, love having this in their collection.  I think a whole grip of sistas would want this for a birthday, X-mas, or Mother's Day gift.  Again, less shopping with all the gratitude!
Really, if  you are a Black person and the late 1990s and early 2000s were a good time in your life, then this bundle will make you nostalgic in a good way.  These movies came before 9/11 and economic downturns and housing market crashes.  This may help you heal in today's tragedies.  I know folk love them some Tyler Perry, but this may be especially appreciated if you don't care for the way Mr. Perry's work has flooded the market and speaks for the lowest common demoninator.
My one critique is that this should have been a 4-pack, rather than a 3-pack.  This should have included ""Love & Basketball"" since that and ""Brown Sugar"" were basically the same film.",1246147200,2,1126,4.427184466019417

8151230,4,B000JJSJQE,"Good value for your money. Not that I was crazy about them all. I don't really like ""Waiting to exhale"", I thought ""Brown sugar"" was just ok (but don't blame me- I watch anything with Sanaa Lathan in it :D), I enjoyed ""How stella got her groove back"". And that just about sums up my review on the ""it's a love thang"" box set.",1287273600,,325,4.09375
