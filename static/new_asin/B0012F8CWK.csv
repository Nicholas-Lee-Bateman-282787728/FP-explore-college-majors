8245745,2,B0012F8CWK,"This is generic.  I bought it looking for better information on birds and ungulates in East Africa.  The film really just shows a picture and moves on to the next species for yet another brief synopsis.  Check out some Nature, Animal Planet Nat Geo for better background, behavior and species info.  Better yet, get a good Africa species guide and take it with you.

A tidbit.  If you notice, this video is made DVD on demand.  If you are prompted by Amazon at a future date to send it in to resell, their third party will not accept it as it is an incorrect format.  FYI.

I found the guidebook invaluable after my guide would ID e animal and I could review at day's end.  You can really pick up quickly if you apply yourself on safari.  And bring a good pair of binoculars!",1313539200,,775,4.3125
