2410679,4,B000BBGV38,"Good clean fun, the 70's version of witchcraft.  Great cast, well paced, well acted film with great assertive female character (Lee Grant, looking so well dressed and luminous).  Mom - protective of poor, picked on Rita, great role model, loving wife.  Sis Christine (Helen Hunt) - the ""good"" daughter - so obedient, well-behaved, attractive, and trying so hard to get along with her ""dumpy"", angry sister Rita (introducing Susan Myers - 'Revenge of the Nerds', 'True Confessions').  The situation goes from bad to worse as Rita begins to realize her gift of telekinetic power, and poor old Dad (James Olson) with his insensitivity and everyone else except Mom is in for a resentment/revenge binge - falling from gym ropes, bursting into flames, hit-and-runs, drowning experiences - Mom tries to warm Rita it's not all about her temper, but Rita is having too much fun to stop.  Parapsychologist (Jack Colvin - great!) believes Grant is to blame, boy is he in for a shock!  And so is Rita...Lots of female power, snappy dialogue for Grant, great transfer and sound quality.  It's interesting to see how marginalized a girl can be based on appearance - ""Rita"" isn't actually fat at all and her body resembles many of her female classmates in the opening scene at the H.S. gym, maybe she's a little curvier - it's her frumpy clothing and untamed hair that present her as ""overweight"".  A glimpse into the world of wealthy WASPS with witchcraft ability and our perceptions of the female form.",1419120000,4,1489,4.880952380952381

2410681,4,B000BBGV38,"Spell is a made-for-TV movie that evokes the best attributes of Carrie and other teen horror films of the era, only to be damaged by some bad writing and continuity. Characters essential to the plot appear with minimal explanation and disappear just as fast, and a minor character suddenly takes on major importance. Lee Grant, of course, dominates with a fabulous performance. The ending was a surprise that made Spell all the more worth watching. Spell is fun horror entertainment for a rainy day at home.",1413244800,2,507,4.906976744186046
2410682,4,B000BBGV38,"Rita (Susan Myers) is a teenage girl trying to navigate through the emotional labyrinth of high school. She happens to be overweight (aka: about average by todays standards). Of course, it's the 70s, and poor Rita is surrounded by future super-models and anorexic stick insects. Rita is mercilessly tormented by her nasty peers (think CARRIE). If that's not bad enough, her home life is almost as intolerable. Rita's prickly dad is incessantly criticizing her for almost anything she does. Thankfully, she appears to have special ""mind powers"" (CARRIE again) that she uses to demolish her enemies. A mean girl in her Gym class falls to her death. Then, when Rita's long-suffering mum (Lee Grant- DAMIEN: OMEN 2, VISITING HOURS, THE MAFU CAGE) visits a sick friend -against Rita's wishes- she watches as the woman spontaneously combusts! A parapsychologist is called in to combat the eeevil forces and baaad vibes. More deaths occur in spite of his involvement. Mum finally finds out the secret behind Rita and those that she has killed. This leads to an apocalyptic, supernatural showdown! THE SPELL is an occult thriller. As such, it is absolutely ridiculous though very enjoyable. Watch for an incredibly young Helen Hunt as Rita's sister!...",1387238400,8,1244,5.1330049261083746
2410683,4,B000BBGV38,"I was around when Carrie was an original movie in the theaters & of course liked it.. This TV-version ""The Spell"" was enjoyable for me back then as well. And I recently was able to catch it on television. Me, personally, I like the movie and would watch it again but it's very difficult to see the old TV-movies from years ago..",1271980800,,328,4.306451612903226
2410684,3,B000BBGV38,"If you get the chance to see this movie, don't pass it up. Very obviously inspired by ""Carrie"", it is nonetheless a fairly effective made-for-TV thriller in which an overweight 15 year old finds she has powers that enable her to take revenge on people who bully and tease her. The film stars the capable Lee Grant in the role of the mother, and Susan Myers plays the troubled teen, Rita, with some flair, mixing moments of intensity with a general childish air and a touching propensity to say please and thank you when asked to! Unlike Carrie, she actually has a fairly normal family, and Grant in particular makes for a very supportive parent who tries her best to get to the bottom of Rita's problems. The meat of the action, of course, lies in what Rita actually does to her enemies, but don't get too excited because as you might expect from a TV movie there's little in the way of bloodshed or violence.

That's not to say that there is nothing worth seeing, however, as the film does have one stand-out scene which everyone who has seen it seems to remember. When Rita's mother pays a visit on a elderly lady to see how she is, this (previously unseen) character walks down the stairs to welcome her, but before she can say anything she starts choking on her own tongue, her eyeballs turn zombie-white and her head swells up and goes purple! Seconds later she is billowing smoke and crashing through a glass door, before collapsing on the ground and dying in agony. This brief but remarkable (and horrific) scene comes as a real surprise when up until then all we have seen is a near miss hit-and-run car accident, and one of Rita's tormentors falling off a rope in gym class. It certainly gave me nightmares as a child. The remainder of the film follows Grant as she uncovers how Rita is carrying out her psychic reign of terror, and attempts to stop her.

Although well acted by the cast (including a very young Helen Hunt as Rita's more popular sister), the overall effect is weakened by some indistinct plotting and not very good continuity. Some characters and events are barely fleshed out at all. At one point we are introduced to a psychic researcher (or something) who has a tape recording of Grant, seemingly explaining her situation in some kind of therapy session. This is very badly inserted into the film, as its hard to work out when it is supposed to be happening. Similarly, the old lady who burns up is a character who has only ever been vaguely referred to by the cast, and as soon as she does appear she is dead before she utters a single line of dialogue. Other events and character motivations are tossed into the background in a similarly hap-hazard manner. This seems to be a film made in a hurry, and to make it worse, several scenes are also quite sloppily edited together.

Sadly, as the video is now deleted and no DVD seems in the pipeline, it's unlikely that The Spell will resurface for re-appraisal any time soon. What works is the likeable cast (I always enjoy watching Lee Grant), and the one totally out-there shock scene, but apart from that it is rather mundane and not really capable of standing out among the many other late 1970's TV thrillers. However I would still recommend a viewing if you come across it.",1164758400,16,3256,4.552901023890785
2410685,3,B000BBGV38,"The 70's was a weird decade. With movies like The Exorcist and The Omen, the supernatural was a prevalent element in horror movies. Even stranger it spread into the tv movies of the time. Lifetime they weren't. Witchcraft, entities, and haunted houses were regular topics. (I have two listmanias devoted to this.)

The Spell is admittedly a ""Carrie"" rip off. A fat girl is taunted at school and criticized at home. It also doesn't help that her sister is a pretty, popular and young Helen Hunt. With the help of her young gym teacher the girl obtains occult powers and uses them to punish her enemies. Unfortunately the movie isn't as interesting as its premise but it's all right. 2.5 rounded to 3.",1156291200,6,699,4.682926829268292

It's about an ""overweight"" girl (i guess for the 70's she was overweight, she looked normal to me), her name is Rita, and she has a father who is rude to her, all the time. Rita isn't exactly the sweetest girl, but who would be with everyone calling her fat all the time. Her little sister is the golden child of the family, and can virtually do no wrong. So Rita takes matters in her own hands in a kinda rip-off carrie way. It had some twists and turns that i found to be clever. It's also free with prime right now, so if you are looking for a 70's lifetime movie-esque carrie/horror rip off, then this should be able to be good for you too!",1456704000,,717,4.092198581560283

2410713,3,B000BBGV38,"OK, so its a story about a young girl dabbling in the occult. Very 1970's exorcist rip off (in a very mild sense).

2410725,4,B000BBGV38,"THE SPELL (1977) This made-for-television CARRIE clone offers a witchy take on its Hollywood better. With excellent supporting performances all around from Lee Grant (In The Heat Of The Night), a young Helen Hunt (Twister), and James Olson (Amityville 2: The Possession), we are introduced to Rita (Susan Myers of James at 16), a telekinetic girl who is disaffected from her semi-dysfunctional family. Rita is becoming alienated from everyone, in fact. The girls at school taunt her because of her chubbiness. Hostilities are simmering between Rita and her younger sister. And her father tends to come down hard on her, rather than build bridges of understanding. This teen is troubled, angry and deepeningly aware of the gifts with which she might lash out at her tormentors. And she does. Strange deaths befall classmates. Her father is nearly run over by a hexed friend.  And her sister is almost drowned at a swim meet. Most disturbing, is Moms visit to to see an ailing friend. The friend spontaneously combusts in front of her, an unexpected and startling spectacle. By the final act, the family has had it with Rita and would arrange to send her to school in England. This triggers climactic surprises this reviewer never saw coming. I recommend it for lovers of CARRIE and obscure TV horrors.",1421798400,,1300,4.963302752293578

8084525,3,B000BBGV38,"While it is certainly not one of the greatest horror films, The Spell certainly has no lack of charm that the 70's offered. It's more or less a diet version of Carrie, but Susan Myers does a good job of playing the frumpy angsty outcast. A young Helen Hunt plays her agitator sister, but for the most part, she's more or less in the background. The real star is Lee Grant. As usual, she brings a sense of class as Rita's understanding and sympathetic mother.
As far as the technical bits, Shout Factory added about ten minutes of unseen footage, which mostly consists of the parapsychologist listening to tapes of an interview with Marilyn about her concern for Rita. The 1080 remaster certainly makes the film pop a bit more, considering it's never had a makeover before, but it still looks as if someone just took it off the edit room floor in many spots. The real disappointment is the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which makes everything claustrophobic, and this is no exception.

First Shout did this with ""You'll Like My Mother"" (which Universal later released a dvd, which I bought immediately), next they did it with ""The Lonely Lady"", and now they're making this mistake a 3rd time, with ""The Spell"".

My other complaint it that this is a made-for-TV movie from the 1970's, but instead of releasing it in the original 4x3 ratio, they are cropping off the top and bottom of the picture to make it widescreen 16x9.
