8282364,4,B001B8TKGA,"For anyone who loved the original ""Tweeny Witches,"" the new Tweeny Witches OVA, the Adventure, adds in some wonderful side stories.

Even if these are side stories set before Arusu saved the witch world, they make for good stand-alone episodes. Some, such as ""The Magical Girls Squad - Transformed into Fish!"", have hilarious scenes in which the main characters Arusu, Shiela and Eva walk around the town with blankets to cover their fish heads.

Others are great flashback episodes. ""The Ice Witch and the Dragon of Fire and Ice,"" is an especially epic tale which looks at the witch Grandmaster's childhood. She was a witch named Gana, who raised Hanamomo, the daughter of a friend, to help her save the Witch Kingdom from the evil Ice Dragon. This episode features magnificent fight sequences with magic.

Sometimes the animators are very inconsistent with the character designs. Episode three looks too loose, and episode four too simplistic, to be considered acceptable.

Thankfully, the last few episodes are visually spectacular. In ""The Secret of Dragon House,"" we learn the real reason that there's a humongous dragon in Eva's house--because Eva had to save the Witch Kingdom from total annihilation. It's a little too hard to explain in one review.

Other episodes, such as ""A Heart Sealed Away,"" focus on Arusu's own adventure in helping two witches named Tohma get along. This episode features especially flashy visuals of red and blue magic. However, these visuals are nothing, compared to the humongous fairy in ""Magical Girl Squad: Storm and Stress.""

Like I said, these are side stories that don't play much of a part in the main storyline of ""Tweeny Witches."" However, the best episodes really look amazing. And some episodes, especially ""The Fairy Chronicles,"" even made me shed a tear. This is a great OVA for fans of the original series.

This DVD also has plenty of nifty special features, including an interview with the Keiichiro Miyoshi, the sound director, and with Tamiya Terashima, who wrote the original score.",1237507200,4,2037,5.062686567164179
