1798561,3,B0000714B5,"After a long wait Siddhartha was released on DVD. The first impression after watching this movie was-disappointment. I had read the book numerous times and knew the ups and downs of the story very well. But the stregnth and depths of major chracters was not played with the intensity as was portrayed in the book. Some of the sequences which were brilliantly concieved and told by Hermann Hesse lost its way in the movie. The relationship between Siddhartha and his childhood friend Govinda was shown very superficiously. The character of Vasudeva which is very deep and intense in the book was not taken seriously. The most memorable part of book where Siddharatha meets Buddha was shown in a hurry.
Although movie doesnot live to the expectation of one who has read the book but still it has some very positive aspects. Cinematography and locations are extreamly good, the rendering and music of Tagore's poetry is absolutely marvelous.",1041984000,11,938,4.980891719745223

1798608,1,B0000714B5,"This needs to be clear. This is soly fiction, as well as is the book and is not the teachings of Buddha. Siddhartha The Guatama Buddha is the current known Buddha who teaches the dharma as we have it today. The writer inflicts conflicted information that is not Buddhism. Prince Siddhartha became the Siddhrtha Gautama, the buddha as we know today. Known to some as Buddha Shakyamuni, which means sage/enlightened one of the Shakya. which he was the prince.

1798609,3,B0000714B5,"I read the book and saw the film 40 years ago, and just re-read the book and re-saw the film. I enjoyed both the first time around. On rereading the book, I was struck by Hesse's complex and subtle reworking of the origins and meaning of Buddhism. As he said somewhere, the perspective of the book is actually closer to Taoism than to the Buddha's teaching (more harmonization of life than detachment from the world). On re-watching the film just after rereading the book, I was struck by how the closely the script kept to the book, including many key scenes and lines. Moreover, the actors are faithful to the book and the cinematography and plot are faithful in spirit. But I could not escape the feeling that the book simply could not be compressed into a film. The book itself is so concise and includes so much meditation on the meaning of things. So much is left out of the film that all the subtlety is gone. Hesse worked hard to overcome the negativity of the idea of detachment while still honoring the wisdom of Buddhism's critique of worldliness (recall that Buddhism followed ""the middle way,"" not the extremes of asceticism). Hesse sought a subtle dialectic between the sharp concision of the Four Noble Truths and Lao Tzu's more gentle, forgiving approach to life. All that is lost in the film, which sounds at the end too much like the cliches of the New Age would-be gurus.",1374537600,2,1390,4.608870967741935

1798611,5,B0000714B5,"This movie follows the journey of a young wealthy Brahmin who seeks fulfilment in life. He travels for years as a sadhu, tries life as a wealthy merchant, learns of sexuality from a courtesan, and meets the Buddha. Beautiful cinematography and hauntingly lovely music will delight  viewers as much as the philosophy narrated.

1798612,5,B0000714B5,"I have read Hermann Hesse's novella Siddhartha several times and have enthusiastically recommended it here on Amazon.  I was worried that the film version would not do justice to Hesse's wonderful short novel.  My concern was not warranted.  While the film is not perfect and some purists will object to liberties director Conrad Rooks has taken with the story, for the most part the film is true to Hesse's intention.

The film begins with the young Indian Brahmin Siddhartha telling his friend Govinda that he will leave his comfortable home and live among the Samanas, a group noted for its stoic and ascetic way of life.  Govinda joins his friend and for several years they meditate and mortify their flesh, but in the end Siddhartha tells Govinda that this path is not right for him.  They leave the Samanas and soon after meet the Buddha.  Govinda decides to remain with the Buddha, but Siddhartha must find his own path to enlightenment.

Now Siddhartha enters the world of the common people.  A beautiful courtesan he meets introduces him to a wealthy and successful merchant.  Siddhartha goes to work for the merchant and quickly becomes rich and successful, but after many years of love with the courtesan and service for the merchant, Siddhartha finds only disillusionment.  One day he simply leaves his home and work.  Much older and sadder, but not wiser, he goes to the river and is taken in by a ferryman.  Slowly Siddhartha becomes one with the river and attains enlightenment.  In the end, his old friend Govinda joins him on the river and the story ends.

Director Rooks treats this story with loving care.  All of the cast of actors he has assembled give thoughtful and nuanced performances.  Cinematographer Sven Nykvist succeeds in giving us a sense that we are in India 2,500 years ago as we walk in the footsteps of Siddhartha in his quest for understanding the meaning of his life.  Of special note is the music of Hemant Kumar, which is integrated into the main body of the film.  The music perfectly captures the mood director Rooks seeks to establish and gives the viewer just one more thing to like about this fine film.

Siddhartha Gautama is the name of the Buddha, but this film is not about the Buddha or his teachings of Dependent Arising and Compassion.  Instead the Siddhartha of this story becomes a ferryman and finds in the river the mystery of the ever present now and the peace that comes from leaving behind the past and surrendering to the awareness of the present moment.  This film entertains and enlightens.  I highly recommend it.",1357776000,2,2576,4.778280542986425

The movie version is magnificent and I look forward to the 2011 release. For me and all spiritual movie watchers and collectors this is a must see.",1311033600,5,278,4.470588235294118
1798648,4,B0000714B5,"The late fifties,sixties and seventies were deeply influenced by Hermann Hesse writings. His Eastern influence was a notorious fact and the huge spiritual wave that turned around that generation (who hailed Lobsang Rampa, Ravi Shankar' s music, Jim Morrison' s presence, whose main spiritual support was William Blake and the cult Beatles album The magic and mystery tour in the middle sixties)  searching for illumination into a chaotic world made the mankind revisited the work of that old oak (Nobel Prize in 1945). Siddhartha, Demian, Steppenwolf and Peter Camezind were his most widely known readings.

In this orden of ideas, Siddhartha was a long expected project but also a feared one due its challenging demands. Conrad Rooks at last decided to walk ahead his colleagues and with the aid of Sven Nyvkist (the legendary cinematographer of Ingmar Bergman). Both were bewitched and engaged by the glittering magic on this ancient location in India North West.

Siddhartha is the story of a man looking for bliss and enlightenment, who leaves his wealthy parents and decides to become a wandering ascetic, following his own path. This journey will lead him to a kaleidoscopic experience (including sexual passion, sense of power and material wealth). Nevertheless he feels the huge  emptiness and runs away from this new stage, finishing his life in company of a humble ferryman learning existential tranquility and philosophical reflections from the river itself.

Although this movie was practically overlooked by the great commercial circuits, it became for many people one of the most dazzling and revealing films of the raising seventies.

1798652,5,B0000714B5,"I am a long time seeker of Truth and Siddartha delivers an excellent example of Life's ultimate quest culminating in profound understanding. Those who gave this movie 1-4 stars, simply aren't ready to understand what this movie contains.  It hits the bulls-eye on every level and is quite capable of introducing the viewer to the deepest and most profound Truths of life. It is not the movies fault if the viewer is incapable of appreciating those Truths. For those who have the maturity in knowing the basic underlying realities of life and the deeper laws which guide it, this movie will not disappoint. I suggest that you watch this movie at least once a year and if you are growing mentally, emotionally  and spiritually, you will see that this movie reveals more and more to you over the years...such is it's depth and deliverance of eternal Truth. I collect DVDs that give inspiration, insight, courage, humor and appreciation of life and this movie ranks at the top of that collection.

1798654,3,B0000714B5,"Director Conrad Rooks was something of a sensation in the 1970's, the son of the Avon cosmetics empire and an alcoholic by the age of 15, he also spent a number of years in India and taught himself film-making.  Besides his autobiographical 1966 movie, Chappaqua, his adaptation of Herman Hesse's Siddhartha was his one and only cinematic achievement. Today he is largely forgotten.  As of this writing he doesn't even have an entry in Wikipedia.

But Siddhartha lives on as a literary classic and as a result the film is still sought out by loyal and often fanatical fans of the book.  A quarter century later it is still a visually beautiful film, one that can impress, especially on a large screen, with its panoramic shots.  Brooks knew India and his familiarity with the place shines through in the film.

The acting is not bad, but on occasion overdone, such as the boatman's homilies delivered in a patronizingly saccharine voice.  The script is occasionally clunky, lifting bits straight from the book, and in parts the story seems a bit rushed.  The middle section - in which Siddhartha meets Kamala, moves to town, and becomes a local businessman - has the most natural and unhurried flow.  Two decades on the sex scenes are not unsurprisingly tame - and occasionally comical (such as Siddhartha's first orgasm).

The biggest problem with the film is that it leaves out what is for me one of the most meaningful observations of Siddhartha's life, that his time as a husband and father, as a property owner and businessman, was not wasted time.  On the contrary, he could not have arrived at enlightenment without having experienced a life of sensual pleasure - and despair.  As Siddhartha tells his friend Govinda many years later:

""I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.""

1798698,4,B0000714B5,"Read the book first, but don't miss this film!

This film does not fully depict the growth of Siddhartha over time, but it does depict an India that is no longer there. Plus! The music and song used in the film does very much to add flavor to the film. For example, there is an actual group of blind, roving singers that were used in the film that made their living thru song.  Cinematography is excellent as well. (Many of the scenes were filmed on a Raja's private preserves that are not open to the public eye.

The story abridgement is disquieting especially since the film is so short (less than 90 minutes) an additional half hour could have made a great difference in fleshing out Siddhartha. This should have been a 2 hour film.

All said however, I do not regret buying the DVD. I have been searching and waiting for its re-release since 1971. In the theatre in 1971, I was so moved by the music that my eyes were teary with an inner joy that I had never experienced before or since. A MUST SEE!",1192147200,3,1004,4.324468085106383

Since they really got into the novel and its overall significance for their own lives, I thought showing the related film would be a good idea.  However, I was so very disappointed in this film and its negligent portrayal of the journey of Siddhartha.  I'm not even sure I want to show it to them now!  The film does very little to capture the symbolism and depth of character found in the novel.  The acting, dialogue, and events seem as dry as a story-board with no color.  Many of the most profound moments in the novel are omitted, while other moments are altered to make them almost laughable.  A film that captures the beauty and true nature of the novel is long overdue.  This film appears dated (and I don't mean Gautama Buddha dated) and the acting and character portrayals are VERY 1972.  Don't get me wrong, the film may have been ""remarkable"" for its time, but it would be nice to see a film-maker attempt to capture the true essence of Siddhartha and his life-journey.  Besides, a few special effects when Govinda sees the faces of all living things in the image of Siddhartha would be pretty cool!",1172707200,4,1203,4.553488372093023
1798700,3,B0000714B5,"No movie that is even marginally true to the story that Nobel Prize-winning German author Hermann Hesse told in his novel Siddhartha (1951) is without merit; and this modest film is no exception.  The problem is, that while Conrad Brooks, who wrote, directed and produced the film, is true to the storyline of the novel and even in some respects true to the spirit of the novel, he fails to bring the power and the resplendence of Hesse's philosophic and spiritual masterpiece to the screen.

What made the novel one of the best ever written is the character of Siddhartha himself.  Patterned after the Buddha both in temperament and in experience, Hesse's Siddhartha, ""the Accomplished One,"" grew up amid extravagant wealth and privilege only to dump it all in an effort to find himself.  Brooks fails almost immediately when he leaves out the scene from the book in which the young Siddhartha, not wanting to directly disobey his father (and to demonstrate his resolve) stands up all night waiting patiently for his father's permission to leave their splendid estates.  This is one of the great ""coming of age"" scenes ever written and an early insight into Siddhartha's strength of character, but Brooks gives it barely a notice!

Also skirted over too quickly are Siddhartha's years with the samanas in the forest where he practiced meditation and austerities.  This part of Siddhartha's life was essential in making him the man he was and in showing us his character.  He spent six years with the shamans and gurus of the forest (along with his companion Govinda) and in the end learned everything they knew and more, and yet had not found the answer he sought. (This parallels the experience of the ""emaciated"" Buddha.)

Brooks does do the meeting with the Buddha well, having us hear his voice but not see him, and then follows that up with Siddhartha's reasons for not following the Buddha, even though he finds no fault with the Enlightened One's teachings.  Note that without his actually meeting the Buddha, the life of Siddhartha (which is one of the traditional names of the Buddha) would so closely parallel that of the Buddha that some people might think that Hesse had written a profane life of the Buddha, which might not set well with some Buddhists!  (Of course we all have the Buddha nature.)

Siddhartha's life with the courtesan Kamala and the merchant Kamaswami and his spiral into debauchery and sloth is well depicted, although again the ultimate disillusionment that Siddhartha experienced is not as well presented as in the novel.  Which brings me to Shashi Kapoor who plays Siddhartha.  Although he would go on to be the veteran of well over a hundred films, and although he is appropriately enough Indian as well as tall, dark and handsome and a good actor, he fails to evoke the passion that Siddhartha must have.  Siddhartha felt everything in a profound manner, even boredom was profoundly experienced by the Brahmin's prodigal son.  Kapoor, especially near the end of the film when he plays an old man, occasionally made me feel that he could be ""the Accomplished One,"" but more often he made me feel that he was holding something back.

Finally, the poetic scene near the end of the novel when, after living with and being guided by Vasudeva, the ferryman, Siddhartha becomes one with the river and falls spiritually into its wisdom, is only a bland shadow of what appears in the novel!

Part of the reason for the failure probably has to do with a limited budget.  The film is 83 minutes long, but could easily be twice that long.  Part has to do with the selection of scenes and the emphasis on those scenes, and finally part of the reason has to do with the relative inexperience of Brooks who was only directing his second major film (and apparently his last).  Certainly the on-location in India cinematography by Sven Nykvist who worked on so many films with Ingmar Berman is not to be faulted.  Although not spectacular, Nykvist's camera conveys both the exotic beauty and the poverty of a landscape that could have been India 26 centuries ago.",1171584000,2,4084,4.812589413447783

I saw this film in its full-screen glory at age 15 or so in an audience with all of four people, and it had an impact like no other movie before or since.  Research the film, and you'll find a rather strange story behind Conrad Rooks and how the film was made.  Rooks has a very interesting interview included on the DVD.  The film largely languished for more than 30 years in a conflict between Rooks and Columbia Pictures before finally finding the light of day again in the late 1990's.  Rooks is to be commended for using an Indian cast, Indian music, securing shooting locations previously inaccessible to the West, and employing the marvelous Sven Nykvist as cinematographer.  A review at Imdb talks about the effect seeing this movie had on an audience in Sweden in 1974, and I echo what they say.  I also love the Hesse book, and think the DVD makes a great compliment to it.",1161907200,5,986,4.50561797752809
1798703,2,B0000714B5,"I have loved Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha for many years, having first read it in psychology graduate school in 1974 and then 10 years later. But all those who know and love Hesse's wonderful novel Siddhartha know that it is primarily a novel about the quest for inner enlightenment. Even though we follow the main character SIddhartha through the struggles with his father, his years of meditation in the forrest as a Sadhu, his dialogue with the Buddha, his years of love-making with Kamala, and finally his work and meditation as a river ferryman; yet the novel is centered around the spiritual growth and inner direction of the main character. The plot is secondary to the inner growth of the main character. In fact, it has less plot than almost any novel since the tensions are not between characters and situations but primarily between Siddhartha and himself in his quest for truth.

Thus, this is not an easy novel to turn into a film. How do you show the quest for inner enlightenment? How do you keep the interest of the viewing audience when the plot-line is minimal?

The writers, directors, and cinematographers for this film relied on minimal dialogue and beautiful cinematography of Northern India's bridges, castles, villages, forrests, and rivers.

Unfortunately this was not enough. The actors appear to have never read the actual novel and thus both actors that portray Siddhartha and Kamala seem wooden, stiff, and over-stated rather than realistic.

The relationship between Siddhartha and his father was not fully developed. The relationship of Siddhartha and Kamala was a primary focus and anchor of the film and yet the actors handled it like day-time-TV soap-opera melodrama.

Scenes with the historic Buddha were some of the better parts of the film in that the filmakers had the Buddha voice-over essential clear summaries of Buddhism without ever seeing the face of the Buddha.

With the special effects we have today and an all star cast it could have been spectacular. However, even with a limited budget, I think this film could have been better. As other reviewers have pointed it, the movie came across as being ""emotionally flat."" Also, because some important parts of Hesse's book were left out of the film, the movie seems choppy in places. For instance, when Siddhartha decided to leave the Samanas, he was challenged by the leader whom he bested at his own game. Another important scene that film neglected to show, was after Siddhartha's failed suicide attempt (which, itself, could have been portrayed better)when Govinda came upon him and didn't immediately recognize him, but sat by his side until he awoke. And there were many other important omissions as well, some of which could have been fixed with an accompanying internal dialog.

As with all works of art, in whatever media form it may be expressed, this is an interpretive statement of the author's original novel and as such it is an interpretation as much based on the audience it is geared up to as well as the film maker's. It may be legitimate for a critic to dispute the finer points of the interpretation or even  the philosophical or religious underpinnings but in this case, it seems to me that we miss the point.

As a reader, I must confess to finding all of Hesse's work not as it would appear at first glance. Even Siddhartha, an apparently simple tale, is a much more complex and thought provoking text than it appears. Not being an expert in this area, I do not dare to present an exegis of the book which I will happily leave to more authoritative reviewers.

To me the director has tried to tease out, as he sees them, the salient points of the text and has done so in a personal form as if the main character is the narrator. He tells the tale in a rather unfeeling way suggesting a sense of detatchment and objectivity, a device which is present throughout the movie and which in a way denies the need to try and deal with an emotional aspect. Siddhartha's inability to deny his emotions is sorely tested when his newly found son rejects him and runs away to the town. Further, his innate inability to recognise these passions and deal with them brings into sharp focus the imbalance in his character of being too objective, too clever, too logical. In a way the film seems to be taking more of a Zen approach throughout.

There is abundant beauty throughtout this film. Not surprisingly the three central characters are very photogenic and beautiful and their surroundings are clear and beautiful too. The exposure of poverty and opulence to the camera gives everything an appearance of beauty including the poor and the holy men. This again allows the highlighting of the bad as feelings and inhumanity such as the travellers pushing away the young boy as he searches urgently for help for his mother.

There is beauty too in the overall serenity of the movie which perhaps may have been an aim of the director.

Ultimately, this movie can be interpreted too on many levels and in that it certainly follows the book. I found it to be engrossing and thought provoking and my only negative is the excessive echo on the voices.

This is a must for anyone who wishes to take an introduction into Hesse's work before delving into the text. It is worth watching too as a sumptuous spectacle of filmmaking.",1127865600,16,2817,4.531496062992126
1798740,5,B0000714B5,"I am at a loss to understand the one star reviews and most of the negative comments even in those that were more charitable.

In comparing the story as told by the film with that of Hesse's novel, I can only say that upon first reading the book long ago I was surprised and disappointed to find the story of its Siddhartha not that of the historical Siddhartha Gotama, said to have become the Buddha.  I still do not understand that - whether it arose out of a hazy knowledge of the true story on Hesse's part or as a subtle literary or metaphysical device.

On first seeing the film, also long ago, it seemed somewhat flat to me, perhaps reminding me of the disappointment I had upon first reading the book.  Now, thanks to the availability of the DVD, I have just seen it for the second time.  There is depth, breadth and beauty in it I did not appreciate when I first saw it.  I look forward to seeing (and hearing) it again, now whenever I wish.

It is not the story of the Buddha, but it shows much through which he might have passed and, more abstractly, through which any of us might pass.",1098489600,20,1096,4.265700483091788

If this film were made of the story of Christ with the same liberty, the filmmaker would have been dragged through the streets.

1798743,5,B0000714B5,"Wow...how can I even find words to talk about this film? From start to finish, I felt like I was in swept up in a meditative state--the captivating music of Tagore's poetry, the beautiful cinematography, and the quiet simplicity of the film.  I suddenly found myself on Siddhartha's same journey, the quest of who am I and what am I doing here? And in the end, I felt totally complete--with all the answers and none at the same time.  Some have said ""there is not enough"" in this film.  Not only do I disagree, but I think that's the whole point! In an age where we are bombarded by special effects and other distractions, what a delight to see something that is not ""trying"" to be something! It just ""is""--and leaves it up to you to see the beauty, which is abundant for all the senses.  Again, it is an adaptation so of course not everything can be included, but I felt Rooks ""kept it simple"" in Buddhist style and I didn't miss a thing.  Everything I needed to see and hear was there.  Also thought the casting was perfect--Shashi Kapoor dead on as Siddhartha and I thought had great chemistry with Simi Garewal who plays Kamala.
A special note about the bonus features: Don't miss the interview with Conrad Rooks! That was almost as enjoyable as seeing the film itself--his synchronistic and humble tale of how the film overcame substantial obstacles to finally be made.  I don't think I've ever heard as much behind the scenes info on a film! You're on the edge of your seat to hear what happened next....
Truly amazing, a delight for the senses.  I can't even think of anything I DIDN'T like from this film--it did that much for me.  I felt totally at peace.  If you are spiritual at all and open to someone else's interpretation of the book, you will not be disappointed!
Enjoy!",1079222400,18,1785,4.498452012383901
1798744,1,B0000714B5,"Since your initial desire to see this film is because you fell in love, as I did, and countless millions, with Hesse's novel, there is no need to go over the plot.  Having waited for so long for this film to make it to DVD, I was immensely disappointed, even a little peeved, when I finally got to sit down and watch it.  Here's why:  Although the film was beautifully shot, great cinematography does not a good film make.  All of the scenes are flat and utterly fail to capture even the slightest essence of what Hesse sublimely achieved in the book.  As the writer of the screenplay, Conrad Rooks missed the boat entirely.  For example, when Siddhartha confronts his father about striking out on his own, the scene is this quick ping-pong typ of edit between the father and son; it's over in a flash and you get no idea about the struggle or the love that either one feels.  No dramatic tension, no cost, and hence no pay-off whatsoever.  One of the most beautiful moments in the book is when Siddhartha meets Kamala at her palace.  Again, 99.9% of the essence of the scene Hesse created is just omitted or forgotten by Rooks and the actors in his film.  And the dialog that is in the script seems like it was just lifted haphazardly from the novel, without any true understanding from either the director or the actors about what it means or what's truly going on.  Flat, flat, flat! Unfortunately, the film gets no help from the actors.  Sashi Kapoor as Siddhartha seems lost (as the actor) and utter lifeless.  And there was absolutely no chemistry between him and the actress playing Kamala.  The only scene that even gets close is when Siddhartha meets the Buddha in the forest -- and the wonder of that scene is achieved from the voiceover Buddha, who you do not even see on the screen.  The music in the film is very good however, but again, that is just not enough.  Sadly, the weakest links in the film are the director, his screenplay, uninspiring actors and an inability to direct those actors.  In the end, Conrad Rooks' Siddhartha is a major disappointment.  A remake that does Hesse's book justice is long overdue, and I do not recommend it.  I feel that Bertolucci's ""Little Buddha"" with Keanu Reeves as the historic Siddhartha (Gotama) fully achieved and captured the beauty, mystery and transcendence that is on the spiritual journey.",1058745600,120,2353,4.612980769230769
1798745,5,B0000714B5,"Conrad Rooks makes a sincere effort to adapt the Herman Hesse classic to screen and succeeds to a great extent.  He pays much attention to Hesse's story and avoids taking away its soul.
Siddhartha, a Brahmin's son leaves home in search of himself. He joins the sadhus and is not content, he meets the Buddha but even the great teacher cannot quench his thirst, he crosses the river to find Kamala, a beautiful courtesan. While his life as an ascetic is one extreme, his life with Kamala is another.  Still discontent he crosses back the river to find the answers long evading him, by the banks of it.
The story is set in the time of Buddha so best efforts are made to keep the setting authentic. The camera captures the landscape of India in its true form as Siddhartha travels with the sadhus.
Rooks employed well known film stars of Indian cinema in his movie.  Shashi Kapoor as Siddhartha and Simi Grewal as Kamala put in a sincere performances.  They both look the part.
Although many emotions are lost in the transition of a book to a film, this movie is an honest attempt of the filmmaker to translate the classic to this medium.",1056412800,22,1135,4.521951219512195

7973647,4,B0000714B5,"Siddhartha a Brahmin's son and his friend departs his fathers house in search of a different life than the sedate environment of home. His father (Amrik Singh) says that if he finds truth then return and tell him. And if he should find nothing to return any way; as like the river everything returns.

His path through the story, that takes place in no certain time or place, sort of parallels the Buddha's searching's but is not a fictionalized version. His friend finally chooses another path leaving Siddhartha to find his way alone. Siddhartha decides that enlightenment comes from within and can not be taught. The Buddha admonishes Siddhartha not to be too clever.

His searching takes him through several lives as he learns of love and money, and a few more experiences. He almost seems like snot as he explains to a courtesan that he doesn't really love. Recognizing that he has wasted his time with searching he comes to some interesting conclusions.

In this 1972 film by Conrad Rooks captures more of the original book than he intended. The film was not intended to be more than an adoption of the book as the director figured that his 25 years in India gave him a better insight than Hermann Hesse's (the book that the movie was based on) 11 month insight.
