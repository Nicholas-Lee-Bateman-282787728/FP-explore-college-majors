2373635,5,B000A6M9U8,"I first purchased ""Power Yoga for Athletes"" for myself because I was searching for DVD's that really pushed my limits. Some other workout programs left me feeling as if I had hardly worked at all! Not this one. I felt my strength increase with each workout. The best thing was I bought one for my nephew who plays football in high school and he was impressed with all aspects in building strength and flexibility. This may have been the one of the greatest gift I could have ever given him.",1152489600,,490,4.455555555555556
2373636,5,B000A6M9U8,I love the DVD as much as I enjoy Adrienne's classes at her studio Namaste.  It is great for when you vacation/travel so you can keep up with your practice. It is a tough but exhilarating workout and well worth it!,1152489600,,214,4.219512195121951
2373637,4,B000A6M9U8,"There are some extremely good and some very bad aspects to this DVD.  First, I really enjoy the pacing of Adrienne's salutations.  The number one problem with any power yoga tape is when the workout is geared towards the body part, not the true interlocking geometries of the entire body.  Yes, this is a very sweaty workout.  Yes, is is challenging.  However, there is no need to break up a vinyasa into segments.  Also, the arrangement of the initial leg workout, in my opinion, is backwards.  Instead of squatting and reliance on Jet Airplane, it would have been better to do Warrior 2, Reverse Warrior, Side Angle Pose, Crescent (with back foot aimed straight forward, resting on balls of the foot), Revolving Namaste, Right Angle Pose, and Wrapped Lunge.  This could be followed by a Vinyasa leading to Chair Pose and Twisted Chair.  Adrienne's sequence is virtually backwards, leading to a tightening of the hamstrings.  After this sequence, wide angle forward bends should precede getting down on the mat to work the upper body.  She is following a body builder mentality.  First, let's do squats, then lunges, then bench press, etc.  I do think her repititons of Plank and Low Push-up combined with Side Plank is a great upper body variation, but if she truly adhered to more of a logical ashtanga style sequence, all body parts -- legs, back, abs, chest, arms, could be worked in a uniform manner.  Again, criticisms aside, this isn't the worst sequence and does have some interesting poses.  I do not want to see candles in another yoga DVD again.  It comes off as superficial, particularly when Adreinne Reed seems like the least spiritual yoga instructor I have ever seen.  Someone who calls her practice ""work"" doesn't need metaphysical props.  Yet, I will occasionally do this workout because it's a chance to do something different and requires strength.  All in all, I think Adrienne Reed needs to study Brian Kest or Baron Baptiste when it comes to assembling a true, fluid, hard, logical vinyasa.",1150243200,10,2014,4.870588235294117
2373638,5,B000A6M9U8,"This workout is an athletic approach to yoga, but it's still straight up yoga poses. Every part of the workout is focused on a different area , you start with 15 minutes of sun salutations A & B, then you focus on your legs with some lunges and chair variations then you work your upper body with a series of push up , cobra , and down dog variations and then you work your abs , Adrienne , the instructor makes you work real good & you'll definitely feel your muscles burning and work up sweat. At the end there's some stretches and relaxation. Also there's a seperate savasana segment which is 10 minute approx. and you can do it if the relaxation of the workout wasn't enough. The workout is 60 minutes + the savasana = 70 min. The production and video quality are really good and there's a nice background music. The only thing that disappointed me is that there were no advanced yoga poses like she demonsrates on the cover, but never mind , it was challenging enough.",1140480000,21,973,4.3812154696132595
2373639,5,B000A6M9U8,"This DVD is not for the timid. I must admit that I was skeptical before I bought it; I thought that people only practiced yoga to meditate and gain flexibility. Wow, was I wrong! This DVD provided me with a workout I will not soon forget. It is a complete body workout and will definitely leave you feeling great. I highly recommend this DVD to any active individual that is looking for a new way to work out!",1131840000,10,409,4.256410256410256
2373678,5,B000A6M9U8,I thought this DVD was pretty good. I enjoyed some interesting instructions she had. It gave me a good workout.,1191888000,,111,4.6
2373679,2,B000A6M9U8,"I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).
This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I  jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.

In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless.",1188345600,3,626,4.1652892561983474
2373680,2,B000A6M9U8,"I bought this DVD based on the raving reviews here and I was very disappointed.  It was fast paced, and while I had no problem keeping up, I felt like I wasn't getting a good enough workout.  I am used to a more rigorous Ashtanga flow and to me this was a lame imitation.  I would not recommend this to anyone, especially those who like a challenging yoga workout.",1174867200,5,364,4.246376811594203
2373681,4,B000A6M9U8,"This is a good workout as far as power yoga is concerned.  It will work all of your muscles and definitely provides some challenge (I previously did cardio and weights on a weekly basis).  My only complaint is the poses seem somewhat rushed and there isn't much of a calming effect with the workout because of it.  Bryan Kest's power yoga DVD (my favorite) has challenging moves, yet still promotes calmness and fluidity.  This DVD does have slightly more varied moves than Kest's, but Reed seems to sacrifice the calm and fluidity that should come with these moves.  Don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend this DVD if you are looking for a good workout, but Reed's brisk voice seemed to put me off a little.  Wasn't too crazy about the music, but you couldn't really hear it anyway.",1173571200,3,793,4.628571428571429
2373682,5,B000A6M9U8,"This is my favourite DVD in my collection.  It is tough, and not for beginners.  I run marathons and find this practice challenging.  The transitions are smooth and she does a nice job at giving variations.  The participants are from various levels and don't make you feel inadequate, like some other advanced videos. I most definately reccommend it.",1171929600,3,350,4.982758620689655
2373683,5,B000A6M9U8,"Adrienne Reed's Power Yoga is indeed what it promises: a great workout for athletes. If you're an athlete and don't wish to get into the spiritual side of yoga but instead want to get a great workout, this is the DVD. LOTS of pushups and abdomen-strengthening exercises. While the poses are not really complicated, they do demand a lot of energy. You'll feel the burn in your thighs!",1167868800,2,383,4.647058823529412
2373684,4,B000A6M9U8,"The virtues of this tape are also its limitations - the session focuses on developing individual muscle groups by grouping poses together to generate a lot of heat and lactic acid in those specific areas.  This differs from a more traditional yoga philosophy, which tries to even out body work without pumping too much blood and energy into any particular body part.  The pace is also fairly fast, with not a lot time to settle into or work the poses.  Because this is a strength-oriented session, moreover, the emphasis is on muscle work more than flexibility (not a lot of seated poses).  Overall, this is an excellent, strength-oriented athletic yoga session, which should be of great help to athletes at all levels.  For experienced yogis, this session can be great if you remember to focus on breathing, your locks and keeping a long, supple spine.  The pace and the focus on muscle-building might turn some people off, however.",1161648000,8,933,4.8734177215189876
2373685,5,B000A6M9U8,"I picked this up on the reccomendation of a fitness board that I frequent.  I love power yoga and this one does not disappoint.  The moves are not complicated,(don't let the cover picture put you off) but are held for a fair amount of time to give you a good stretch.

I like the instructor's style.  Right to the point while being encouraging, without a lot of chatter.  The best part of this tape is that the warm up and cool down are separately chaptered, so you can go right into the actual workout without doing endless sun salutations if you dont' want to.  I'd highly recommend this tape.",1155859200,12,595,4.412844036697248
2373686,5,B000A6M9U8,"I Love this video, it is a challenging yoga video.  Adrienne's direction is excellent and easy to follow.  I recommend this video to all levels of yogi's.",1155686400,3,154,4.666666666666667
2373687,5,B000A6M9U8,"This yoga workout will definitely improve your stamina and strength and unlike many other yoga routines, the instructions are clear, concise, and easy to follow.  Whether you are new to yoga and looking for an addition to your cardio/strength training routine or you are an experienced yogi, this yoga DVD will be one you will return to again and again.",1152489600,2,353,4.883333333333334

8075300,4,B000A6M9U8,"While this isn't my favorite yoga DVD, I use this DVD often. As a runner, I need to work on both strength and flexibility, and this DVD delivers both. I work up a sweat every time I do this routine! The workout is pretty basic, but does the job. My only complaint is that no one seems to be enjoying this workout, including the instructor. She is so serious!

One other complaint, it is impossible to skip the introduction. Once is enough. Note to producers: next time, make it possible for viewers to go right to the workout.",1308700800,2,526,4.36734693877551
8075301,5,B000A6M9U8,I was looking for a good workout with yoga-type moves and this is it.  I get a workout and burn calories while increasing my core strength and stretching.  A lot of my normal aches and pains that come with running have disappeared.,1278374400,,231,4.476190476190476

8075303,5,B000A6M9U8,"Power Yoga for Athletes is very easy to follow. You don't have to think. I like the way Adrienne guides you through the different yoga positions step by step in a very encouraging manner. I also like how it is set up so that it doesn't matter what level you are at when you begin the program. You can be a beginner,  advanced or anywhere in between. She has a no nonsense approach in her method of leading you through the exercises but she also comes across as caring deeply about what she does. The results of the program for me have been very effective. I play hockey and I feel more balanced and relaxed on my skates.",1233273600,2,620,4.254237288135593
8075304,5,B000A6M9U8,"I came to yoga when a knee injury stopped me in my running tracks. For anyone who thinks, as I once did, that yoga ""isn't enough of a workout,"" try this DVD! BTW, after working yoga into my routine, my knees give me no more trouble.",1222992000,,232,4.065217391304348
8075305,5,B000A6M9U8,"I'm a distance runner and started using Adrienne Reed's Power Yoga video about a year ago while training for a marathon. This ~1 hr DVD really excels at combining both strength conditioning and flexibility exercises (muscles and joints, including hips) into one flowing workout.

I've used Adrienne's routine consistently for about a year now, and the troubling hip inflammation I used to experience has gone away! I credit the stretching and core strengthening for the improvement.

Thanks, Adrienne!",1206489600,3,501,5.410256410256411
