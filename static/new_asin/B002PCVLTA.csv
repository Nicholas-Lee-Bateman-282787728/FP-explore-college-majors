3964473,4,B002PCVLTA,"As in many of the zombie flicks that have popped up as of late, the zombies in 2009's DEAD AIR are not lumbering reanimated corpses but are, instead, living folk who have become fast-moving but mindless flesh-eaters as the result of some sort of viral infection.  But what makes this film from director Corbin Bernsen--yes, THAT Corbin Bernsen, he of L.A. LAW fame--stand out from the others is the fact that the virus in question is released by terrorists. In a scenario that's not too far off from reality, the terrorists release the gas at densely peopled spots (such as professional sporting events) in major cities all across the U.S.  The film, however, focuses on events that occur in Los Angeles, and the audience sees these events unfold from the perspective of a radio shock jock named Logan (played by genre regular Bill Moseley).

In spite of the differences in the zombies, DEAD AIR in some ways hearkens back to the claustrophobic feel of Romero's original zombie trilogy. Like the surviving humans in Romero's classic zombie films, Logan and his coworkers barricade themselves against the increasing zombie population by holing up in a building, in this case at the radio station where Logan works.  Keeping tabs on outside events via TV news broadcasts and call-ins from their radio audience, they helplessly watch as the Los Angeles falls into the hands of flesh-eating maniacs.  Eventually, though, their fortress also falls into the clutches of unfriendly hands, and Logan leaves to search for his wife and child...hoping that they have not been zombified.

Overall, DEAD AIR is a well-made little indie horror flick.  Moseley and his costars--including Patricia Tallman, here reunited with Moseley for the first time since their appearance together in Tom Savini's 1990 remake of Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD--do an outstanding job of acting, the directing is solid, and the zombie FX, while on screen for only a minimal amount of time, are realistic and effective.  The film does take a bit of a nosedive at the end when Logan, reunited with his family, recites some saccharine (and presumably internal) diatribe in which he essentially blames the governments of the Western Hemisphere for war and terrorism.  But that's a minor flaw, and most die-hard fans of the genre will still enjoy the film.

Anthem Pictures' DVD edition of the film has a few flaws.  The most egregious problem with the disc is that the widescreen transfer, while crisp and clear, is not anamorphic. Also, when played on blu-ray players, two different copies of the disc skipped at the exact same spot (about the 5:45 mark), though both copies played fine on standard DVD players. On the other hand, the disc has some nice extras, which include a behind-the-scenes featurette and cast and crew interviews.

In short, DEAD AIR is a decent film that horror fans, especially zombie lovers, will want to add to their collections.  We can only hope that a better DVD or Blu-ray release will appear at some point in the near future.",1266969600,6,3035,4.950787401574803
3964474,2,B002PCVLTA,Quite disappointed with this one. A great idea but without the budget needed to pull it off. I'm sure the book if there is one would be much better. Shame !,1266364800,,156,4.064516129032258
3964475,4,B002PCVLTA,"For those in search of the traditional reanimated corpse zombie film, you may wish to look elsewhere. Dead Air is done more in a style similar to 28 Days/28 Weeks Later. As a viewer I found this film to be very frightening, because in all honesty, it is not all that far fetched to think that the events of this film could actually take place. I have been waiting in eager anticipation for this movie ever since first hearing it was being made in 2007, and I can say it was well worth the wait.

In Dead Air, a plague in the form of a toxic viral gas is unleashed at a major sporting event in Los Angeles, turning its victims instantly into mindless, rage filled lunatics. A few blocks away from the site where the gas was released, controversial talk show radio host Logan Burnhardt and his production team are caught up in the middle of the chaos. They soon begin to receive reports from their listeners calling in with their first hand experiences of the violence and mayhem taking place in the streets. Barricading themselves inside the studio, Logan and his team vow to stay on the air and continue to bring reports to the public of the horrifying ordeal. As if the rioters in the streets weren't enough, the terrorists responsible for the attack are making their way to the radio station, killing anyone who gets in their way.

The film once again brings together Bill Moseley and Patricia Tallman, this time as a divorced couple now working together on a talk radio show. The two had worked together previously on Tom Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead. The film also marks Tallman's return to the genre. Moseley plays Logan Burnhardt, the host of the show, and the movie follows him as he and his production team attempt to remain on air keeping the public informed while also trying to get in contact with his new wife and daughter.

As previously stated this is not your traditional zombie movie, if one could even call it a zombie movie to begin with. Instead of relying on walking, decomposing corpses to frighten its audience, Dead Air effectively scares us by playing on our paranoia of terrorist attacks and the realism of the events taking place. It is not unfathomable that an attack like this could occur in today's post-911 world.

There is not an excessive amount of gore in this film, but when the blood is spilt it is done to great effect, portrayed realistically and never over the top. The same can be said for the violence in this film, whether it is onscreen or implied off screen, skillfully crafting a very realistic sense of dread. That being said, there are a very few moments where the film does get kind of cheesy, such as a scene in a parking garage involving a man on a motorcycle and one of the infected, but all in all the camp is kept to a minimum and the Dead Air plays it straightforward.
I would highly recommend this movie to fans of 28 days/28 Weeks Later, or for fans of Bill Moseley who might be interested in seeing the actor play a less psychotic character than we're used to seeing him play. However, if you like your zombie movies of the more traditional shambling dead variety - along the lines of Romero's films - this movie may not be for you.

3964476,4,B002PCVLTA,"We listen to it in our cars, our stereo, our TVs--we're even able to listen on our iPods and MP3s nowadays, all because of the technology of radio waves. Those that host these shows become friends, people we come to know and trust due to their entertaining personalities. Without them, what'd we do on our commute to work, or in our free time if we had nothing else to do?

What would happen if, in the midst of a terrorist attack, one of those radio stations managed to live? And what if, despite the odds, they continued to broadcast?

Welcome to DEAD AIR.

Centering around a radio host named Logan and how a nightly discussion about paranoia turns deadly, we follow a group of radiomen and women who happen to get caught up in what appears to be the worst attack since 9/11. Armed with nothing other than their radio, Logan, Gill, Burt and their producer, Lucy, prepare for the worst, all the while chronicling their experience over the air.

No matter what happens--no matter the odds--these four will continue to broadcast, all in the midst of the apocalypse.

I can't begin to tell you what I thought going into this movie. Though centering around a seemingly-simple thing, DEAD AIR surprisingly turns out to be a highly metaphorical and questioning movie ensues. With underlying themes such as terrorism, comparisons to the war, and a strong background of 9/11, DEAD AIR is sure to strike a point with some people. Therein lies what I believe will be people's main fault with the movie--the political undertones. Though I myself wasn't bothered by said undertones, it may be due to the fact that I'm not necessarily concerned with politics or the deeper undertones that flow through them. The brief bit of racism that ran through the film was unsettling, but not enough to really impact the viewer, as no one other than Logan's wife (who only briefly appears in the movie) catches and questions it.

Like any film, DEAD AIR has its disadvantages, no matter how hard you want to look in the other direction.

- The zombies. They flail their arms to and fro, have no cooperative or defined movements, and fail to act like our traditional undead would. Though fast, they lack the determination and concentration we've seen in previous movies. Whereas in films like DAWN OF THE DEAD '04, where the zombies run fast, have set movements and will attack their prey until completely devoured, these zombies will attack anything, even when they have fresh prey in front of them. They rarely bite, preferring to scratch, they'll 'play dead' when seemingly mortally-injured (ala human style,) then get back up again. This was one of the main faults I had with the movie, but the zombies are almost pushed entirely aside by the end of the film, so it's not that big of a deal.

- The special affects. It's become a common Hollywood idea that putting a bullet in someone's head equals a hole as damage, which entirely defies physical and the way the cranial structure works. Though this is really the only obvious flaw of the special affects department, it's a particular irk that can get to fans expecting more realistic gore. The scratch and bite wounds are realistic, to a degree, but the gunshot wound isn't.

Minor faults aside, DEAD AIR is actually a really good film. But, like I said, I think most viewers (particularly those with strong views or intentionally-fabricated racism) will have either a strong positive response, or a strong negative response. Still, that gives you no reason to turn this film aside. Its strengths lie in the tension it builds up, as well as the atmosphere it gives off.",1260230400,6,3602,4.7504
3964477,4,B002PCVLTA,"As a zombie movie fan and director I just had to check out this movie. While this isn't DAWN of the DEAD caliber it is a still an eerie film in many respects. I think the cast did a great job with what they had to work with here, and director Corbin Bernsen had some nice little tense moments spread out through the film.

Many call this low budget, but I don't consider it low... I know because I make films for $10k or less and this had some money to spread around because there were some very effective set pieces and set ups that effectively make this movie work.

THe basic premise is that a bio-weapon developed by our own US government falls into the hands of some extremeists whom unleash it on the populace and sporting events in a large amount of US cities. As the chaos unfolds LA's #1 late night trash talk show Dj, Logan Bernhardt (Bill Mosely), is doing a show dedicated to paranoia... how appropiate. When word hits the airwaves of a chemical attack causing people to turn into blood crazed killers is when the movie really begins to build its tension and holds you... but it doesn't hold forever. Some of the screenplay and choices of dialogue make the film fall into the full on cheese category, but you know what... its ok, because there is enough here for zombie horror fans to help them feel at home in the favorited zombie genre. Bill Mosely and Patty Tallman are together again, and this hasn't occurred since the Night of the Living Dead remake in 1990 and here they turn in way better performances than the NOTLD remake.

Clocking in at 90 minutes the movie has some slow moments and does falter here and there, and the ending is a bit of a let down, but from the moment chaos begins and you hear callers to the radio station describing the peril they are in makes you wish they could have had a little more money to delve into that situation. Dead Air definitely needed a $20-$30m budget as this film could have been so epic, and it feels epic with what material they have to work with, but it could have gone so much further, but in the end it is what it is and I enjoyed it and I think most will too.

The gore is sparse except for a cool headshot scene that even made me go... HELL YEAH! I could complain there isn't enough zombie footage, but it doesn't really need to be there anyway, it would help, but is not necessary for this type of film.

In the end it is recommended.

3964478,1,B002PCVLTA,"The movie had potential, the initial scenes of the outbreak at the arena were okay, showing middle eastern terrorists releasing a virus in a sports arena causing massive rage. Infected roaming the streets,and coming back to life; but then they cut to this late night radio show, and spend LOTS of screen time taking calls, and talking, talking, talking. Most of the action took place off screen. The plot was very predictable and the simulated zombie attacks resembled that of high school drama students. Drama students might have done a better job!

8376917,4,B002PCVLTA,"A lot of other reviews compare Dead Air to Pontypool. Sure they do share similar settings in that a lot of the story takes place in a radio station, and both have ""infected"" subjects. In my opinion, they go in different directions after that. Dead Air deals with a terrorist attack as the catalyst for the infected, while Pontypools' catalyst is the English language itself. I found both films entertaining, but I wouldn't say that either film is the poor man's version of the other. I also loved seeing Bill Moseley and Patricia Tallman onscreen together again. Their last endeavor was the Tom Savini directed remake of The Night of the Living Dead. In Dead Air they play ex-spouses instead of siblings, but I enjoyed seeing that dynamic play out. If you watch this film and do nothing but compare it to Pontypool, I think you will be disappointed. As I have said, they share similar settings, but for me it ends there. Give Dead Air a watch, then watch Pontypool. Choose for yourself. I choose to like each for not their similarities, but their differences.",1361318400,,1059,4.698924731182796
8376918,5,B002PCVLTA,"I have read several reviews that say Dead Air is a poor copy of Pontypool. HOGWASH is all I have to say to all those reviews. I don't care which came first, ... the remake of Day of the Dead (even with super fast ""spiderman"" zombies) is in my opinion way better than George's original... (sorry but George's social commentary was just beating a dead horse in Day!  Dead Air and Pontypool both take place in a radio station and revolve around the crew and radio talk show host. That is where the simulates end. In Dead Air, the viewer is given a ""who, what, where, when, and why"" of the ""zombie"" outbreak that gives the watcher a solid footing in a scenario that could actually take place. Movies, mainly sci-fi and horror movies, for me are about the suspension of disbelief. However, I need some reality and believability in my fantasy, and I can easily believe that a bio-weapon can turn folks into infected, flesh craving ""zombies"". The idea of a phrase of the English language turning folks into zombies / ""virus being spread through language"" is way to far fetched and just plan silly to me (Pontypool). {So, as you can tell, I am NOT going to waste my time with Steven King's zombie movie where cell phones aid in turning folks into zombies!}
I'm not looking for high gloss shallow Hollywood budget nor ""something new"" in the zombie movie genre. I want believability in my suspension of belief. I also want a solid, well thought out and written story and strong actors playing solid characters that say and do believable things while in the mist of zombie chaos. It's those qualities that I feel separates ho hum crap movies from super great movies of any genre. (Just look at the original Night of the Living Dead... need I say more?) Dead Air is not an overproduced Hollywood ""ain't it cool cause I think I`m so cool"", shoot um up, egobation, piece of crap movie like the remade Dawn of the Dead movie; that I use to like until I watched the movie with the director's commentary on. Yes, there is underlining social commentary in Dead Air, but it adds to the tension of the movie and wasn`t heavy handed or overdone to me. The acting was top notch and believable due to them casting some great actors! The plot was believable and the story was well written with believable dialog. And production was great. Zombie movies have a fresh new innovative superstar, Corbin Bernsen! Dead Air is a super great zombie movie. I dare say one of my top favorites! Thank you Mr. Bernsen!",1318896000,,2482,4.552572706935123
8376919,3,B002PCVLTA,"Ever since I first rented Return of the Living Dead from the local video store when I was about 10 yrs old, possibly even younger - I was hooked on the zombie genre. Although ROTLD was more a comedy-horror, as I grew older I was able to see the serious social contexts that lay underneath the surface of alot of these films, especially in Romero's masterpieces. The tradition is continued in this independent, thought-provoking little thrillride. Dead Air is set mainly in a radio station, late night shock-jock Logan (an awesome Moseley); Lucy (a gorgeous Tallman); Gil and Burt (Moscow and Feinman) are doing a show with paranoia as the main topic when terrorists unleash bombs across American cities that contain a mysterious, biological substance that turns people into murderous, fast-running zombies that attack anyone in sight (similar to the Rage virus of 28 Days/Weeks). Our protaganists at first are skeptical to the calls that are coming in but soon realize the horror is all too real when they are forced to barricade themselves in their office from the carnage occuring outside. What do they do in the meantime? Continue broadcasting live, of course!

The film's biggest flaw is the whole conspiracy theory angle of it. The whole ""your government is bad and we're just victimized, misunderstood Muslims"" won't fly with me. Yes, the mysterious bioweapon, we later learn, was created in a U.S. Govt lab in Virginia. Granted. However, it was the Islamic terrorists who actually went through great lengths to unleash its horror. So I would say they're both at fault but not equally, the jihadists are worse for letting it loose. Also, I thought it was kind of stange that Burt would risk his life to go save Logan's family. Doesn't Burt have any family, friends, or loved ones that he would have rather saved? I found this odd.

Nonetheless the film is entertaining even if its cliched. Zombie apocolypse fans, like myself, will be satisfied.

8376920,4,B002PCVLTA,"I haven't had a lot of luck with horror movies that my Tivo digs up for me from the depths of Showtime's many channels (Showtime Extreme, Showtime Women, Showtime Movies that Time Forgot).  So you can understand why I thought Dead Air was probably about zombies on a plane.

I was close.  Dead Air is about zombies on the radio.  Okay, it's not quite that either.

Dead Air is a surprisingly fresh update on the zombie genre using modern conventions of terrorism, conspiracy theory, racism in America, and freedom of speech. It tells the story from the narrow view of a late night shock jock Logan (horror staple Bill Moseley), and his production team of Lucy (delicious Patricia Tallman, teaming up with costar Moseley from the Living Dead remake), Gil (David Moscow) and Burt (Joshua Feinman).  Gil and Logan are America at its worst, crude and condescending, mocking their listeners and taking glee in their paranoid conspiracy theories.

In contrast are the terrorists led by Abir (Navid Negahban). They too take great pleasure in mocking Americans, but unlike Logan and his crew, use more than harsh language on their targets.  Abir's terrorists unleash their ""zombie bomb"" on crowded centers around the world, including a stadium near Logan's radio station.  Logan and Gil's snide remarks about conspiracy nuts turn serious when it becomes clear that what's happening is no joke.

What happens next is less Night-of-the-Living-Dead-zombies and more 28-Days-later-zombies as the plague spreads, turning normal citizens into bloodthirsty maniacs. The terrorists are on the loose too, and they decide the best way to broadcast their message is - you guessed it - a radio station.

Dead Air is more interested in the new fragile state of the American psyche than the zombies themselves.  Logan transforms from cynically putting down his callers to becoming their voice of reason, keeping his listeners informed and taking calls from witnesses just trying to survive.  Dead Air has minimal gore, but it makes up for it with these little vignettes of personal terror as callers whisper into their phones before being torn apart.

The movie happens in real time, taking us through the skepticism, disbelief, resignation, and fear that the four protagonists go through as they grapple with what just happened.  For those of us who remember September 11, it's all too real.

The movie shifts gears a bit once Gil decides to rescue Logan's wife and child by fleeing on a motorcycle.  The scenes are thrilling but ultimately unsatisfying as Gil tries to navigate a world gone mad, all the while broadcast live on Logan's show via the radio in his helmet. It's an interesting premise, but we just don't get enough of it.

Dead Air has some clever twists that make for an entertaining ride.  Although the film is sprinkled with chastising asides about the state of America, it is ultimately a hopeful film with a message:  When we turn on each other -- be it as zombies or in the media - the terrorists win.",1298592000,3,3000,4.938247011952191
