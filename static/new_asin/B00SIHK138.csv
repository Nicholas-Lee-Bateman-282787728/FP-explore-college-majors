6987655,3,B00SIHK138,This boxset contains a lot of episodes that carry a TVPG logo at  the start . These shows do not have the high technical qualities. Are they recorded off TV ? Series content still high.,1429401600,3,185,4.285714285714286

6987659,5,B00SIHK138,"What is up with the price? Season 9 has the same list price as season 8 even though there is one third less content. I will still buy it because I love the series, but $35 for two discs is outrageous. Shame on Olive films!",1426464000,7,222,3.9555555555555557

6987662,5,B00SIHK138,"One of my all time favorite cartoons. I am so glad the remainder of the seasons were finally released on DVD after having to wait what must have been at least 10 years between the release of season 6 and 7, I think.

6987665,3,B00SIHK138,"In process of gaining all the King of the Hill seasons for my collection. All other seasons I was able to get for about $14 give or take, but now going up they're all $20. Cost sucks but this season then only has 15 episodes compared to the average 22 of most others. It's not amazons fault, just a bummer that for more money, I get less. Seems silly!!!

Otherwise I love the show and love my seasons!!!",1487980800,,403,4.166666666666667

(Beware of Seller changes! That's how you can get burned!)

ANOTHER 5-STAR FOR ME > I am a biased fan though...
Starts off SLOW, the first 2 episodes are not my favorites, then the 3rd episode starts to take off.
Episode 1 & 2 feel like the writing focus was affected by the Guest Stars presence, although the PEGGY episodes are not my favorite.

The GNOME episode was funny, I know people like ""AUNT"" SALLY & they are soo irritating :)

Sadly, it's another SHORT season with 15 Episodes, but the quality is good & I have no issues with my purchase.",1480291200,3,622,4.336206896551724

6987679,4,B00SIHK138,"I'm so glad Olive has released the remaining seasons of this show. The picture looks great too.

My 4 star rating is because of the decline of the show itself. The retconning of Peggy's mom drives me nuts but there are still some good moments. I love Tom Petty's character, Lucky. His quest to get Bobby into the corn chip factory is one of my favorite episodes from the season.",1465084800,,378,4.4

6987690,5,B00SIHK138,"I'm glad someone (Olive films) finally took the initiative to put the remaining seasons out on DVD, even if they don't have any special features. Originally only the first 6 seasons were released, presumably because of low sales numbers, so many of us just waited, occasionally checking sites for DVD release dates, or looking for info on what was going to happen with the rest of the series. This review is for all the remaining seasons, from 7-13, and while I normally take the presentation into account when reviewing, I have to give this season, and the whole series, 5 stars for its consistent stellar quality. The show didn't have the cultural impact of The Simpsons, but it also didn't have the swings in quality. 13 years is a good run, but I do wish the show was still on the air. If I have to say something negative about the show, it's that I never liked Lucky's character.",1450915200,6,884,4.566037735849057

6987697,5,B00SIHK138,"This is far superior to The Simpsons, both in writing and in graphics.  Character development in the main characters is thorough and adds to the enjoyment by making it almost possible to predict how each character will react in a given situation. They always react in accordance with their well-described character.",1441497600,,315,5.176470588235294

8698454,5,B00SIHK138,"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.

Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play. I don't know if they got bad copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no freeze ups and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time.

Yeah man, I tell ya what, man. Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 15 uncut episodes of Season 9 are on two single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:

Disc One:
01 A Rover Runs Through It
02 Ms Wakefield
03 Death Buys A Timeshare
04 Yard, She Blows!
05 Dale To The Chief
06 The Petriot Act
07 Enrique-Cilable Differences
08 Mutual Of Omabwah

Disc Two:
09 Care-Takin Care Of Business
10 Arlen City Bomber
11 Redcorn Gambles With His Future
12 Smoking And The Bandit
13 Gone With The Windstorm
14 Bobby On Track
15 It Ain't Over Till The Fat Neighbor Sings

Video: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The colors pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.

Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English

Extras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!",1501977600,12,2161,4.292383292383293
8698455,3,B00SIHK138,"this is my first time seeing anything past Season 8. I was disappointed, because I'm really fond of the show. it really feels as if the writing took a significant nosedive. episode plots seem over-simplified (with fewer parallel subplots) and with fewer smart surprising nuances than before. Sure, that's not entirely what I watch the show for (I love to laugh at some of the truly stupid things Dale or Bill or Joseph say) but it often would make what would just be a laugh on another show into a truly sustained laugh out loud moment. I feel like many if not all the characters have suddenly become dumber. especially Peggy. or much more shallow. at first I thought it was what has happened in some prior seasons, where it almost seems like the show doesn't hit its stride again until episode 4 or 5. not the case for me. bottom line is I haven't felt like re-watching any of these as I have and do with Seasons 1-8. so, I guess I'm saying ""let the buyer beware"". just my opinion.",1501718400,,982,4.430939226519337
