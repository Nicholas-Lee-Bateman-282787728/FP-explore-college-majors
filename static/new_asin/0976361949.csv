7794713,5,0976361949,"The Julie Goodnight DVD's are excellent. She gets right to the point without being verbally abusive and sarcastic to the viewing audience like a trainer with the initials BB.

I purchased his DVD's as well, and am totally insulted by his sarcastic remarks about other trainers and to the people attending his clinics.

Julie Goodnight is always kind and respectful to her viewing audience and to the riders in her DVD's. I may attend one of her clinics.",1388707200,4,453,4.794871794871795
