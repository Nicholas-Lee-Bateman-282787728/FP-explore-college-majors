8442574,5,B004V2FUVW,"This is another amazing DVD package from Milestone, highlighting important contributions to early cinema. THE CHAMPION is a collection of films that came from Fort Lee, New Jersey, one of the earliest film towns; the films date from 1910 to 1918; it shows the variety of films which were created at the Fort Lee film studio. There's also a documentary, made in 1935, called GHOST TOWN: THE STORY OF FORT LEE, directed by the film buff Theodore Huff and Mark A, Borgatta, which is informative as well as very entertaining, because it's a movie made, not by professional filmmakers, but by film fans who wanted to celebrate this unique place in American film history. And that's what this collection does: celebrates Fort Lee, one of the great centers of American filmmaking in the medium's infancy.",1513123200,2,797,4.911111111111111

8442576,4,B004V2FUVW,"Champion is an interesting action thriller, and it is true to its title, as Sunny Deol is the cop hero in this movie. Overall, the film has enough thrills to keep you at the edge of your seat. Early in the movie, the mini tussles with that kid are kind of fun before Sunny becomes his hero. Sunny's introduction is definitely worth watching. The villain (a killer) is excellent and clever, and he does well at matching wits with Sunny. How Sunny deals with this killer down to the final fight is well done. Only Sunny Deol could fit this cop role and pull it off so well, which is why he is the best. Go for this and enjoy it!",1305504000,,626,4.181818181818182
