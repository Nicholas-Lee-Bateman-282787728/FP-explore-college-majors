8181607,3,B000NVKWZO,The video was supposed to discuss the Camera specs and features. But it only focus on the building inspection and construction engineering. It is OK for you if you want to see how the camera is useful in civil engineering with some slight principles and a little focus on the Camera itself.,1416096000,,290,4.596153846153846

 I don't want to bash a person so im just going to say one thing that everyone should know, thermal cameras are made to pick up energy so they display different colors for different temps, this guy says that resolution is the most important thing about the camera, he is WRONG the most important thing about the quality of the camera is the sensitivity. Sensitivity is what makes the different in what energy (temp's) the camera picks up or doesnt pick up, the higher the number of the sensitivity the less it will pick up, the smaller the number the better. 0.1 is good anything larger than that is not as good, 0.05 is great it will pick up more. the resolution helps things like a tv sitting infront of a wall be more clear on the camera, instead of being fuzzy and not makeing out what you just took a pic of, the (for resolution higher the number the better).... so im not saying that resolution is not important im saying that it is not the most important. Sensitivity is the most important.
there are other things I can say about this video that suck, but im not going to, just know that if you buy this you may not learn anything. and make sure you do your own research on the product and what it does before puting all stock in what one person has to say. Flir is the leading maker because people have been taught and trained to push Flir, ... it is a great thermal camera, but so is Fluke and Testo and some others out there.  compare the spec's when buying one to decide if its right for you, don't let wifi be your deciding factor ... you don't need wifi when you have sd cards that you can use. look at the other specs. pay atention to the sensitivity and resolution and does it have its own computer program for reporting, that is very important also.",1363737600,7,1844,4.265714285714286
8181609,3,B000NVKWZO,"I watched this via Amazon's Video on demand and consider it worth the watch.
It does cover most the important basics of all thermal imagers and is valuable information.. but it really just glazes over many of important details and contains few examples. Most examples were valuable.. just some were very much glazed over and even spending more time on the examples given would have been more valuable.

Did I learn something yes, worth the rent, but unless you are training staff not worth the buy.

My main gripes:
a) The first 41 minutes of the 70 minute is a guy standing around his office holding a camera in his hand with only a few minutes of examples in that time. The later half when he is in a real environment (someones house); again the guy liked to talk and didn't always get to the point.
b) I heard multiple times they were going to come back to things, and they did not.
c) There are few examples; mostly talk. Then when they started to show an example they would just spend 30 seconds or less on it and never fully explain (i.e. the Window/Glass thing in his office door).",1263081600,3,1088,4.435
8181610,5,B000NVKWZO,Excellent video.  Explains just what thermal imaging is and why it should make an electrician such as myself more money as a tool for both getting work and showing the customer how I have helped them save money.,1254528000,,211,4.552631578947368
8181611,5,B000NVKWZO,"Professional and PACKED with GREAT information!  Buy this video if you are in any type of industry that could use thermal imaging.  (IAQ, Home Inspectors, Fire Fighters)  Thermal Imaging devices are expensive - this video helped me understand the FULL capabilities of the device.  Well worth the money, highly recommended!",1250467200,,322,5.38
