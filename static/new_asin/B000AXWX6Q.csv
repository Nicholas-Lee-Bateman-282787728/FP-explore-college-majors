2395982,5,B000AXWX6Q,"I see folks are asking for a complete set of the White Sox' tremendous 2005 playoff and World Series run in addition to the highlight video sold here.  According to an article in the Chicago Tribune on November 19, 2005 (written by Ed Sherman), in March 2006, a DVD set will be issued that will show all four World Series games as they were broadcast.  However, the article does not state whether the games against the Red Sox in the ALDS or the Angels in the ALCS will be included.  Hopefully they will be, but in the meantime, get the highlight video.  The early reviews are great!",1132617600,14,583,4.420560747663552
2395983,5,B000AXWX6Q,"I will buy this and I'm sure it will be good, but a complete game collection like the one done last year for the Red Sox (Playoffs and World Series)would be better. There's no reason why we can't have it, so I'm wishing the White Sox would do what they can to help us fans get this great memory in a series of all the games!!!",1131753600,7,326,3.9545454545454546

2395986,5,B000AXWX6Q,"That's what the headlines said Thursday morning all over Chicago.  The best Chicago baseball team has done after 88 years...winning the World Series !!  I knew this years Chicago team had something special from the first game I went to this May.  I found myself refusing to go out at night just so that I can stay in and watch the White Sox, defeat the world !!  I cannot wait for this DVD to finally come out...  I'm ordering mine today.",1130457600,4,438,4.3580246913580245
2395996,5,B000AXWX6Q,"MLB films does a phenomenal job with this production. The audio mix is fabulous, featuring muliple broadcasts of the same plays which totally captures each moment. A must have for any baseball fan, not just White Sox nation.",1149724800,2,224,4.921052631578948
2395997,5,B000AXWX6Q,"I love this video. It presents the very best of the 2005 season and playoffs including great world series highlights. If you are old enough to remember Minnie Minoso and Billy Pierce you will love seeing them as they comment on the 2005 world series.

I was so delighted by this very professional DVD that I have ordered the DVD's with full game coverage of the 2005 world series available in late March 2005",1140998400,3,408,4.513513513513513
2395998,5,B000AXWX6Q,"Finally after 88 long years the Chicago White Sox are world champs once again

This dvd is a great wrap up of the postseason run and celebrations on the bonus features this is highly recomended for any Chi Sox fan",1139788800,2,213,4.325
2395999,5,B000AXWX6Q,"Starving White Sox fans starve no more.  The proof is in this video.  At the end of October, the Red Sox and Yankees fans were watching at home while one of the most fundamentally exciting World Series unfolded.  At the same time, the 2005 White Sox proved to be one of the most dominating forces in post season history.  Baseball played the way it should be played with pitching and defense.

The dvd runs a little more than an hour.  It starts in spring training but shows few regular season highlights.  Highlights from the Red Sox and Angels series are present, including the controversial ones.  Being a World Series dvd, much of the time is devoted to the series.  I would have loved to have seen more highlights.  There were enough highlights to make two hours.  This is something I will treasure and would love to see in an extended format.  I will certainly watch this dvd frequently.

The White Sox are often the forgotten team in baseball.  With this win the 2005 team is immortalized.",1135987200,6,996,4.5852272727272725
2396000,5,B000AXWX6Q,"The 2005 World Series DVD is a great dvd and a must have for fans of the White Sox.  Narrated by Michael Clarke Duncan and clocking in at around 75 minutes, the film follows the story of the White Sox beginning in the ALDS against the defending world champion Boston Red Sox, continuing with the ALCS vs. the Anaheim Angels, and wrapping up with the World Series sweep of the Houston Astros.  The first two rounds are covered somewhat quickly, but this allows for more of an in-depth look at the four WS games.  There are plenty of great interviews with everyone from manager Ozzie Guillen, staff ace Mark Buerhle, slugger Paul Konerko, and WS MVP Jermaine Dye.

  Also included on the DVD are about 30 minutes of clips from the White Sox playoff run and other things that includes game footage of Scott Podsednik's Game 2 walk-off homerun, Konerko's Game 2 grand slam, Geoff Blum's dramatic home run in Game 3, the White Sox clinching the ALDS and the ALCS, the trophy presentation, a This Week in Baseball Segment with Ozzie Guillen when he was on the Devil Rays, 1959 World Series Game 1 highlights, Bobby Jenks' strikeout of Jeff Bagwell, and the final 3 outs of Game 4 and the subsequent locker room celebration.  Overall, its a great dvd with a lot to offer for a fair price.  And if you're a Sox fan, you can pop this in your DVD player and relive the Sox playoff run over and over again.  A great DVD overall and a must-have for White Sox fans wherever you may be.",1135641600,5,1472,4.442379182156134
2396001,1,B000AXWX6Q,"Some reviewer here said that the astros didn't score any runs. That is inaccurate. They did score many runs, but didn't win any games. I was at game 4 in Houston where backe was awesome but we couldn't score. Our offense just didn't do the job. But I'm still proud of the stros for the amazing run down 15-30 and left for dead all the way to the series. GO ASTROS. There are die hard astro fans out there like me.",1134864000,,413,4.111111111111111
2396002,5,B000AXWX6Q,"Back in October of 2005, the Chicago White Sox marched in the playoffs for the first time since the 2000 season, when they were last in the playoffs, but was swept by the Seattle Mariners, so it has been a good 5 years since there, and could be another 5 years for the Chicago White Sox, if so that wouln't matter now because the Chicago White Sox for the first time since 1917, have won the World Series. Like a lot of the teams, the Chicago White Sox looked foward to another season, and they would be like ""finnaly this is going to be the year"". and then something would always happen that would have the team and its fans to hear the same old words ""wait until next year"". But the Chicago White Sox put those words to rest back in October when they swept the Houston Astros that started the season 13-30, and somehow earned thier ticket to the playoffs. Now I have to admit when the Chicago White Sox got into the playoffs, I didn't think it would be possible for the Chicago White Sox to beat the defending World Series Champions the Boston Red Sox, so I picked the Chicago White Sox to lose, but they swept the Boston Red Sox and put the icing on the cake at Fenway Park, in 4 games. And they had a few days off, to await the winner of the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angles, and for some reason, they won't get a day off, once the series was decided, and that team that won the trip to Chicago, was the Los Angeles Angles, while the New York Yankees won thier ticket to the offseason, and so the Los Angeles Angles got a last minute plane ride, into Chicago and played them the next night in game 1, and they beat the Chicago White Sox, and that was the White Sox' only loss of the playoffs, and so the White Sox won the next couple of games they needed to, and got thier ticket to the World Series for the first time in a long time. Which once again they had to await the winner of the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros, and what do you now it the Houston Astros win the series, and went on to face the Chicago White Sox in thier promised homefield avatange in the Worlkd Series, since it was the American League that won the All-star game for the 3rd year in a row, since the rules went in affect that which ever side would get home field advantage in the World Series, no matter which 2 teams get that far in the playoffs. It looks like to me that this rule of the winner of the All-star game gets homefield advantage needs to end after 2006 All-star game, cause it just looks like the American League is just going to keep winning it every year. And just give the home field avantage to both side every other year. The 2005 World Series Champions Chicago White Sox was lead by Genral Manger Ken Williams and manger Ozzie Guillen who is the first Latin manger to mange and even win the World Series. The docemntuary is narrtored by Michael Clarke Duncan, and this should be enjoyed by Chicago White Sox fans for years to come. So now the questions are what will 2006 be like the Chicago White Sox, they have a title to defend, and which 2 teams will get to go for it next year, and which of the 2 teams will win it? Even through the documentary runs 75 minutes long, I bet Chicago White Sox fans wish that it would run longer.",1134864000,4,3246,4.1952
2396003,5,B000AXWX6Q,"The producers literally hit it out of the park with this DVD release, commemorating the Chicago White Sox and their thrilling World Championship season.  Most of the focus of this DVD is on the four World Series games vs. the Houston Astros, however there are nice features from the Divisional Series vs. the Red Sox and also the ALCS vs. the Los Angeles Angels (of Anaheim).  Michael Clarke Duncan's narration is brilliant and the musical score is fantastic as well; both compliment the atmosphere and the dramatics that unfolded throughout the series, especially ""take your breath away"" moments such as the grand slam by Paul Konerko and the game-winning home run by Scott Podsednik in Game #2.  A tip of the cap to the producers, who wisely incorporated play-by-play and commentary from ALL sources (including John Rooney and Ed Farmer of ESPN Radio Chicago and Milo Hamilton, ""the Voice of the Astros"" among others) and not solely from ESPN and FOX's game coverage.  This DVD would have been an unmitigated disaster if we had to once again endure FOX's Tim McCarver and Joe Buck's incessant moaning and groaning about all of the ""bad calls"" that the Sox were able to ""benefit from"" (which was suspiciously downplayed when Jason Lane of the Astros hit his ""alleged home run"" off of Jon Garland in Game #3, but I digress).  The player interviews are excellent, as well as the use of the wireless player microphones throughout the series.  I also enjoyed Sox infielder Willie Harris' ""play-by-play"" from the dugout in the bottom of the 6th inning of Game 4, as well as the pregame footage of eventual Game #3 hero Geoff Blum (talk about catching lightning in a bottle!), not to mention the comical moment from Game #1 when manager Ozzie Guillen extends his arms to signal calling in ""Big Guy"" Bobby Jenks.  DVD extras are plentiful and enjoyable as well.  Long story short, any White Sox fan will cherish this DVD as a keepsake from a most magical season.",1134691200,13,1956,4.783382789317508
2396004,5,B000AXWX6Q,"The title says it all!!!  I cannot stop watching this DVD.  I think the music is phenomenal.  I only wish it were longer, and every playoff game becomes available at some point.",1133481600,3,177,4.46875
2396005,4,B000AXWX6Q,"A very entertaining DVD, but quite brief on details.

I was at the premiere at the Esquire in Chicago as a guest of a radio station and I must say that meeting Crede and Rowand in person and watching the film with them only a few feet away was pretty excellent!

But the overall quality of the film was very good, just short of superb.  Being a Sox fan for the longest, one can't help but be a little disappointed with the lack of coverage of the fabulous regular season we had, and the extreme brevity of the playoff coverage.  Even the drama of the World Series is a bit lack-lustre due to the absence of game-play description.  This film is very brief!

But who can resist the microphone bugging of Rowand, Harris, Guillen, etc. and the behind the scenes stuff overall.  A must for any Sox fan and even bandwagoners!

I also was a little disapointed with the music.  It lacked the depth and beauty this DVD so deserves.

Still, this DVD is highly recommended.  A must for any true baseball fan!!",1132876800,2,998,4.398907103825136

8080272,5,B000AXWX6Q,"This was a great series for Chicago and actually may have even gotten a few of the rival Cub fans to root for the White Sox.  As a Yankee fan I always prefer to see the Yankees in the World Series.  But I enjoyed seeing the White Sox win.  They had the greta closer in Jenks and the fire and gambling style that Chicago probably hasn't seen since the go-go Sox of Aparicio and Fox in the 1950s.  1959 was the one year that they were able to top the vaunted Stengel Yankees but they couldn't overcome the new Los Angeles Dodgers.  Playing the World Series in the LA Colliseum in 59 allowed for amazing single game attenfence records.  Too bad they couldn't have done better in that series.  But who thought that it would take another 46 years for them to finally get a championship!  I would have to say that after the tough Workd Series loss to the Big Red Machine in 1975 I didn't think it would take the Red Sox another 29 years to finally claim another championship!  But nobody talked about the Babe Ruth junx back then,  The Red Sox had a great team.  They were just unfortunate to be up against an even greater Reds team.

The White Sox steamrolled their way through this World Series after getting past the tough playoff competition in the AL.  Fast but not as fast as the 59 Sox, this team had much better power hitting and batting power in general.  They definitely earned their World Series rings.  But Chicago will not be a truly happy baseball town until the Cubbies finally win!  That could be coming if they stop complaining about the jinx of the goat.

I thought it was nice to see the Houston Astros finally make it to the World series.  Too bad they couldn't put up a better fight with their killer bees.  But the White Sox had a tough road having to get by the Red Sox and then the Angel team that managed to get by the Yankees one more time for Mike Scoscia.",1210291200,38,1877,4.28125

8080274,4,B000AXWX6Q,"This DVD focuses on Chicago's 2005 post-season run, and primarily on the World Series.  While there is some review of the regular season, it is brief.  Pick up the ""Sox Pride"" DVD for a more full recounting of the regular season.

Still this DVD is entertaining and well worth the money.",1155081600,4,287,4.588235294117647
