1065496,3,6305759995,"If I take it apart by each one's acting, I would say they ALL did their part well.  Ziggy is very likable as a hopeful girl in search of her father...and you can't help but love her ditzy (almost deadly) personality.  Walter, you really hope he's the final way out, and the mainstay when it comes down to the Good Guy.  Gossett's small part is believable, and makes you feel he might just be this way in real life.  And I've always liked his acting, even as a tough guy.  And the 90210 Star - seems to have lost his way...a good looking guy who just can't seem to get past that part of him, so he does a bit of being a crazy lunatic?  Maybe he's trying to hard, and hasn't found a really meaty Role to shine on?  But, finally...WP Drake - The guy who's just in the wrong place at the wrong time...forced into a downhill spiral - which makes me wonder How bad does it have to get to end up being a Bad Person yourself?  And why be found out in the lie at the end?  sad story, even I shed a few tears hoping He was the father.  One of those films you have to ready between the lines.

 I couldn't give it more than 3 stars, tho' it was worth watching.

  Certainly NOT for Children or sensitive viewers.",1419724800,,1201,4.051063829787234
1065497,4,6305759995,Every one its a must see its a lot of on the edge of your seat action thriller that just keeps you hanging on.,1381449600,,110,3.625
1065498,3,6305759995,"I saw this film last night. It was presented as a horror feature. It was more like a poorman's Natural Born Killers. Louis Gosset Jr. has an over the top performance and Jason Priestly has a somewhat respectable performance as a psycho. If there was actually a horror element to this film, (eg. a few zombies) then perhaps the plot making sense would not have mattered so much.",1191974400,,377,4.5588235294117645
1065499,1,6305759995,"Okay what is it with Jason Priestley and flop movies? Coming out of Bevely Hill's you would think he is destine to be a star and now he does movies like this 'sigh'.  I just seen this movie the other day and what a waste of my precious time. I feel like i been rip off and then some. The plot is like N.B.K but the direction is lost and the script is just plan ho hum...nothing to keep you interested at all. At least it didn't keep me interested and i really wanted to like it since i am a big fan of his....go Brandon aka Jason!!!!

Watch it if you don't mind watching bad movies.....its so bad is not even good.",1123200000,4,614,3.983739837398374
1065500,2,6305759995,"This movie has alot of action in it and a good story, kinda easy to follow, but it was just missing talent from other actors. See this if you're a big Jason fan, otherwise, skip it.",1061510400,3,181,4.055555555555555

7893834,4,6305759995,"I watch a lot of movies-- always have, even when I was a kid in the late '50s when we got our first used TV. Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff were big with me then.
 Not all movies can be ""Schindler's List"" or ""Forrest Gump"" where all the components came together, skillfully complementing each other providing entry into a fantasy world where you become a fly on the wall, detached from the story but unavoidably intimately involved as the story develops.  Many of the films that film buffs wind up watching are ""B"" movies, two notches below the top with the film starting out at a disadvantage comprised of generally unknown, has-been or known and despised second rate creators among all the crafts that make up the enterprise. Anyone on the film staff has the opportunity to taint the product-- camera crew, actors, writers, directors, producers.  In effect, you would be right to say I did not expect much from this film after the first few minutes.  I persisted though and slowly found myself being absorbed by a preposterous plot detailed with a bunch of characters who were polar opposites from what I have attempted to be/do in life.  They all did real well here though and I watched it willingly to the end.  From the spectrum of the existing ratings I would say that I could not predict what YOU would feel about it but I think the movie was more than worth my time and I am glad I watched it.",1496361600,,1399,4.509881422924901

7893837,3,6305759995,"This movie has a lot of casual violence, a plot and characters that greatly stretch credulity, but it went from being background noise to something I was actually paying attention to and I think overall I enjoyed it.  If you can't find something better to watch on prime video, you certainly could do a lot worse than this.",1480377600,,323,4.568965517241379
