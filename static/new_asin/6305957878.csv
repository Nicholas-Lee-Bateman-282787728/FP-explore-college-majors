1102696,5,6305957878,"It is a shame that the Generation X kids of today, truly
do not understand the genius of the Honeymooners, as the
reveiws before this one would indicate. This DVD is a
treasure to have, and the show will live on, revival after
revival. The quality is as expected, for the time made,
but still packs plenty of laughs, and some clips you may
never have seen before.",1003968000,16,363,4.352941176470588
1102697,4,6305957878,"When I first got my DVD, I knew I just had to have this!  I've been a fan of ""The Honeymooners"" for as long as I can remember (I'm currently 22) and I knew I would enjoy this DVD very much!  And I really do.  It's something that a fan of Jackie Gleason and ""The Honeymooners"" should have in their collection.  My problem with the DVD lies in the fact that two of the programs on here, ""Funniest Moments Vol. 1 and Vol. 2"" have already been released on video, and infact are in my video collection.  These are nice programs to see if you're interested in not just ""Honeymooners"" clips, but also clips of Reggie Van Gleason, Joe the Bartender, and other classic Jackie Gleason characters.  The third program is one that I had not seen before, ""The Wit and Wisdom of Ed Norton,"" which is a salute to our favorite sewer worker.  Again, a very nice program with some pretty good clips.  The final program is ""Letter To The Boss,"" which is an entire ""Honeymooners"" skit from November 14, 1953.  This is one of the first ""long"" skits featuring these characters, and while this is a nice one to feature, there probably are better skits to use.  However, the quality is nice and clear (for a kinescope) but why just present the skit?  Would it have hurt MPI to release the entire ""Jackie Gleason Show"" from that week with the June Taylor Dancers and Gleason's monologue included, as well as credits and commercials?  That would have made this an automatic 5 stars!  I think this is worth having, but like my title says, a good start to introducing a classic to the digital age.
Before I close, I would just like to mention that there are several ""still lost"" episodes in the vaults.  These include the original ""Honeymooners Trip To Europe"" shows performed live in 1957, and the performed again in 1966 from Miami.  These 1957 shows feature Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph (while the laters would have Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean) and these have not been seen since their original airing in 1957.  If MPI wants to release a really great, valuable DVD set, then let's suggest releasing these lost gems!",991267200,60,2094,4.544
1102698,3,6305957878,"The ""Very Best of"" is a only a snapshot.  I wish there were more completed episodes included.  ( ie. top 10 shows ).  There was one weak episode.  If you are a ""Honeymooners"" buff this will only wet your appetite for more. There is almost 2 hours of entertainment.",977097600,14,264,4.326530612244898
1102699,5,6305957878,"I agree with everything that the first reviewer stated.  Except one thing, mine won't be collecting dust on the shelf.  It will definately be a  regular watch for me.
I do hope that a nice box set of all episodes  will be put out on DVD.  That would be a nice opportunity to put the  anniversary show on.  And if they could get the european episodes that  would be a really nice bonus.",969408000,11,385,4.178082191780822
1102700,5,6305957878,"Despite the fact the DVD is not yet out, I would recommend you buy this DVD. Just for the TV show on it, Jackie Gleason and Art Carney are two  actors who can never be replaced. The way they played off each other was  amazing, I'm glad they are bringing this series (hopefully as much as  possible of it) to DVD as all of them will be sitting on my shelf.",968112000,6,355,3.971830985915493

1102914,3,6305957878,This is a DVD with a narrator explaining the background of Jackie Gleason and his team during the filming of The Honeymooners and shows bits and pieces of episodes but not entire episodes.  I was expecting to see several episodes in their entirety.,1383696000,,248,4.767441860465116

1102990,5,6305957878,"I agree with the previous excellent review, in that THIS, ""The Very Best Of The Honeymooners,"" is not THE BEST of The Honeymooners as the title implies, which I especially want to caution those who want to purchase this.  By all means, it is a very excellent DVD without a doubt, for any Jackie Gleason fan.  And it does contain many hilarious excerpts of the Honeymooners.  However, this also contains wonderful excerpts taken from Mr. Gleason's variety shows too.  Yet what I cherish most are the bloopers showing all the many amazing instances where Mr. Gleason alone,

or Mr. Gleason and Mr. Carney and other cast members, managed to sail right through them all!  There is even the clip from when Mr. Gleason broke his leg in a 1954 skit during live television, yet he somehow still finished it!  Now talk about how ""the show must go on!""

That is incredible!  So if you are a fan of Jackie Gleason, you WILL want to add this to your collection, even if it isn't exactly what the title implies.",1167609600,9,998,4.561797752808989
1102991,5,6305957878,"This was back in the classic age of television. This television show, the honeymooners, is a clear example of the genious Gleason had for putting on a show. Back then, television had class. They were very basic story lines but back then they didn't need an elaborate script to cover up bad acting like they do now. Sure, they can call the actors nowadays stars, but the stars of the honeymooners were REAL stars. The brilliancy and capability of mind to ad lib whenever something didn't go as planned still amazes me to think that they could do something as hard as that spur of the moment. To cover up a mistake when you know one without breaking a smile is super acting. The hilarious episodes portrayed in this DVD only points out the case more that they don't make television like they used to. The Honeymooners are always fun to pull out and you'll always laugh; even if you had seen it a hundred times. That there points out that no show will ever be able to come close to the genious of Jackie Gleason and the charm of '50's television.",1129075200,7,1043,4.4375
1102992,3,6305957878,"I was disapointed with this DVD collection! Included are 3 clip collection segments, ""Funniest Moments Vol. 1 & 2"", ""The Wit & Wisdom Of Ed Norton"", and the full length episode ""Letter To The Boss"" Now, as a fan of the show,these characters, and actors who portray them I was entertained viewing this DVD. However, this does not represent the very best of the Honeymooners as the title states! A major part of the Funniest Moments bits include bloopers which in most cases they are not at their very best! I would suggest that anyone who is viewing ""The Honeymooners"" for the first time watch the ""Original 39"" episodes which are available on another collection. ""The Very Best Of The Honeymooners"" is best viewed by fans who have a knowledge of the history of the show and Jackie Gleason.",1103068800,47,789,4.683453237410072

It contains goofups, jackie fill ins, funniest moments, all kinds of mistakes made on camera,where they addlib.,have prop problems,etc. Then there is the wit and wisdom of ed norton plus a full episode of letter to the boss.
