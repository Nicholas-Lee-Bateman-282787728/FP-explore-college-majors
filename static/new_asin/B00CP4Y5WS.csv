5731688,5,B00CP4Y5WS,"Jennifer Beals was initially portrayed as a meek and mild person, who would have her feelings stomped on and ignored for the sake of others being disrespectful to her and themselves.  But she waited at the most opportune time to buck up to everyone in the house.  She eventually showed her strength and I was elated to see her do that.  In this movie, she still indicated that nice and sweet Jennifer I have seen many times.  This movie is actually a top notched movie!",1385683200,5,469,4.482352941176471
5731689,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"Here are some siblings, friends, rivals, and lovers gathered at various times in the home of the siblings' parents, getting a lot of vitriol out as they hash out their differences and major life decisions.  More interesting than it may sound and well acted.",1376265600,,257,4.840909090909091
5731690,2,B00CP4Y5WS,Amazon emailed me asking me to review this film. I'm surprised by that because I never could finish it. I don't even remember the plot. Totally forgettable,1485129600,,155,4.777777777777778
5731691,3,B00CP4Y5WS,Long and slow but interesting.  Not many really likable characters.,1484870400,,67,5.7
5731692,1,B00CP4Y5WS,Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes,1484784000,,38,4.571428571428571
5731693,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"Intense drama, good story, great acting by Jennifer Beals.",1484697600,,58,5.555555555555555
5731694,3,B00CP4Y5WS,It was good....I would rate it wonderful if I understood all the relationships better.,1484438400,,86,5.214285714285714
5731695,2,B00CP4Y5WS,SO full of itself. Ridiculous. 2 stars only because there are few things I really  hate.,1484438400,,88,4.5
5731696,3,B00CP4Y5WS,"Complicated, parts were far fetched, but okay enough",1484092800,,52,5.625
5731697,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"Radically different movie.  Dysfunctional family spending a last night together before the eldest son trots off to jail.  As the evening unfolds, layer after layer is exposed.  Characters are memorable and the viewer is drawn into the family's dysfunction.",1483920000,,256,5.512820512820513
5731698,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"I would actually give this 7 out of 10 if I could, but erred on the generous here. This film pulls you in with an intense set of characters and an unknown plot that builds. As the story unfolds, it reveals complicated psyches that may seem disturbed to some, but also seem relatable and refreshingly raw. I found the acting to be excellent, with a few exceptions. However, about an hour in, the movie begins to drag a little (I found myself checking how much time was left).  It seems to play the same situations with different details or people: lots of drinking, in various rooms in the house, mental manipulation with contemptuous subtext, and revelations that someone else has slept with, yet again, someone else - to the point that it's a little ridiculous. The plot gears up again toward the end.  Ultimately, I came away from this film feeling that at the same time you can admire, detest, forgive, and begrudge, and yet maintain unconditional love.",1483488000,5,956,4.684523809523809
5731699,3,B00CP4Y5WS,I was drawn to this show because Jennifer Beals was in it. It was OK.,1483315200,,69,3.6666666666666665
5731700,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"Superb cast, intense movie but fantastic acting.",1483228800,,48,6.0
5731701,4,B00CP4Y5WS,"Difficult to know where to begin. This is a family bound for destruction, way beyond dysfunction. The entire family, three sons and an adopted daughter so messed up, you wonder how they will survive. The older son, played by Gil Bellows is off to prison in the morning, he killed a man who was trying to kill his present day mistress. Gil's wife is a photographer of reknown, and why she is still with him is a big question. Middle son wrote a book that won the Booker prize, younger son is a screen writer who has plans to make a film of the book. Adopted daughter may have the most problems, but it is a close race.

And, then, there are the collection of girlfriends and hangers on. This is not a film for someone who is down and out, it is quite depressing with little meaning. Good performances by all, but the underlying message is as screwed up as the characters.

Recommended. prisrob 12-29-16",1482969600,7,901,4.421686746987952
5731702,4,B00CP4Y5WS,Makes my family seem normal. Good acting. Didn't really care for the explanation of the parents. That was over the top...almost a joke compared to the dysfunction of the family. The conversations between family and the  visitors completely pulled me in .don't tell don't tell...secrets and family...,1482883200,,299,5.361702127659575
5731703,4,B00CP4Y5WS,It was dark. Even the horrible personality of some of these characters were actually likeable. This was an intense emotional journey. I'm glad my family is pretty boring. I enjoyed their unenjoyable lives.,1482019200,,205,5.242424242424242

5731706,5,B00CP4Y5WS,This is a very interesting family drama.  The story is interesting and the characters are well developed.  I would watch it again.,1479168000,3,130,4.863636363636363
5731707,4,B00CP4Y5WS,Great story of family dynamics during a stressful time of life's transitions. Very thought provoking.  I loved it!,1478563200,,114,5.333333333333333

5731714,3,B00CP4Y5WS,"My generous three-stars are due to the credible ensemble acting.  I personally disliked the premise and dark circumstances portrayed in a very dysfunctional, atypical family.  I would not view it again nor recommend it to my friends.",1458000000,,233,5.27027027027027

5731721,2,B00CP4Y5WS,"I could only stand to watch about 20 minutes of it.  It was strangely dated for movie that had the release date of 2010.  It was more like one of those hideous movie's from the 70's that were trying to be an art film but didn't quite make it. I stopped watching when I noticed the women had to take their shoes off at the door while the men did not.  Weird...  In the 20 minutes I watched; the dynamics of the personal interactions were extremely slow moving, dull and very uninteresting.  I suppose you could just say that the film was both boring and extremely dated.",1452297600,3,569,4.280373831775701
5731722,2,B00CP4Y5WS,Too slow and not much stuff if you know what I mean,1449100800,,51,3.3333333333333335
5731723,5,B00CP4Y5WS,"I love it. This is a story of a self-destructive family that get's off on their self-destruction. If you a looking for a flick about a dysfunctional family where there are light humorous moments then this is not for you, there is no humor in this family drama. I found the casting perfect as well as the performances. This film is not a study on family dysfunction but family destruction so beware when watching.",1448668800,4,412,4.581081081081081

5731725,3,B00CP4Y5WS,"I liked the cast, so I persisted. This film needed a tighter script. It was too ambiguous for the first 1/3 of the movie, leaving the viewer guessing where the story was going. There were a lot of complex family dynamics being explored and revealed, making for decent drama - but the directing overly exploited some of the cast's acting talent. Not sure what would have made this better exactly... Just missing, *something*",1446163200,2,423,4.808219178082192

5731727,2,B00CP4Y5WS,I didn't care much for this movie.  It was very slow.  I like Jennifer Beals so I thought it might be good.  Not so much. I liked the twist in the story.,1444348800,,153,3.71875

8584263,1,B00CP4Y5WS,Bad movie,1498694400,,9,4.0
8584264,3,B00CP4Y5WS,"I started out liking this film; acting and writing are solid.  However, after about an hour, these characters got on my nerves.  I agree with the reviewer who said this film seemed so dated, even though it's not.  I wondered about the revelation about how the parent died; is the viewer supposed to automatically think, ""ah, that explains how all this dysfunction came about?""  This was a good effort, but I felt like I kept getting hit over the head with all their quirks.  I got it already.  By the end, I really didn't care about any of the characters at all.",1492473600,,562,4.46078431372549
