8330259,2,B001OBMPC0,"Illegal use of Joe Zopp is no Clerks nor is it an El Mariachi which were both made with budgets under $50,000 dollars. It takes place in the pseudonymous town of ""Purewater."" There are not any landmarks which are honestly depicted. The motel, the street names and the businesses are not promoted, even the protagonist changes his name to ""Pseudonym. Why is this important in a narrative film? It is vital for an independent film to gather steam on it's way to snowballing into a cult classic and for a hometown film to pick up fans there must be places that fans can visit if only to feel a part of ""their"" film and that is what a film like ""Clerks"" gives and ""Illegal use of Joe Zopp"" cheats the prospective fan out of knowing. I use ""Clerks"" as an example since it is an independent film which uses actors from the area as does this film.  Clerks takes place mostly inside the ""Quick Stop Deli"" and the R.S.T. video store in the town of Leonardo New Jersey which are all actual places still in business today. Illegal Use of Joe Zopp actually was shot in Chippewa Falls Wisconsin and parts of Eau Claire Wisconsin. I believe that if the real sites were identified it would bring a warmth to the film and let the locals have some investment in the film. There is no comparison to Kevin Smiths dialogue which is why a static set like the inside of a convenience store work as opposed to  the many local landmarks which were not identified in ""Illegal Use of Joe Zopp. The standout actor has to be the motel operator and there are funny moments of genuine comedy bordering on slapstick. If a reviewer of this film suggests to ""go out and spend $25 on the film then try it. I just can't wait to read the reviews from someone from Texas or Florida. Bottom line is that the creators sabotaged an otherwise good effort by using pseudonyms and therefore alienating even the local supporters. This film is an independent hometown film without a hometown. This review has been by Craig Barr.",1314057600,,1983,4.475138121546961
8330260,5,B001OBMPC0,"Illegal Use of Joe Zopp is one of the most enjoyable films I've watched in the last year.  Combining the best humor of the Coen Brothers with the best twisted plots of, well, the Coen Brothers--without, somehow, limiting itself to a Coen Brothers imitation--Joe Zopp manages to be clearly inspired by great works and, at the same time, completely original.

Joe Zopp is a brilliant young man who, tired of his treatment at the hands of the small town he grew up in, runs away and becomes a street performer in Ohio.  Eight years pass, and one day he runs into an old acquaintance who tells him that everyone in his old town thinks that he has been killed in a freak train accident.  Naturally, Zopp returns to his town incognito (using the pseudonym Gary Pseudonym) to discover who has orchestrated his fake death and prove his aliveness.

Where the plot goes from there is something else entirely: bizarre all-women suburban neighborhood committees (the P.O.W.s), a cranky hotel manager, garden-gnome theft, infidelity, giant dildos, dingoes, even bigger dildos, competing twin brother mortuary owners (only one of whom, against all odds, is French), and a slew of profoundly foul language, amongst other things, come together to make the world of Joe Zopp unpredictable and hilarious.

The acting is perfect; the timing is perfect; the direction is perfect; the writing is well above par for perfect.  Nick Holle as Joe Zopp is perfectly befuddled and isolated, and the supporting cast is all perfect in their respective roles.

I really can't say enough good about this film.  It is well worth the watch.  By far.  A necessary addition to the DVD collection of anybody who enjoys a great comedy.  Or wants to know the secret to any good disguise (spoiler alert: it's the MUSTACHE!).",1235001600,,1785,4.893687707641196
