8360401,5,B002ATVDCS,"I haven't bought this DVD - but I have seen this film, and it's a little gem. Follow the non-adventures of a teenage boy on holiday, trying to lose his virginity, while his father discusses Grape Nuts with the landlady of the B&B and can't pass a broken towel dispenser in a public toilet without mending it. Utterly English and all too real.",1499644800,,342,4.444444444444445
