426008,4,6302099390,"Quite honestly, after seeing the first film in this series (THEY CALL ME TRINITY), I was a little underwhelmed, perhaps sold out by my own high hopes.  That pic was the breakthrough buddy-comedy-western smash that made Hill and Spencer into superstars.  I enjoyed it, liked its meandering pace and whimsical attitude, but was not blown away.

Now, after having seen the follow-up, I get it.  Everything that was kinda shaggy, kinda loosey-goosey about the first film has been finely groomed here and the difference is notable.  The story plays out slowly but steadily, with proper amounts of both slapstick and action, not to mention some damn fine slapstick action.

Spencer's Bambino is introduced first, duping a group of crooks out of their freshly cooked beans in hysterical fashion.  Not long after the thugs have regrouped from the incident, along comes Hill's Trinity to do the same exact thing!  These two gags set the tone for things:  The two protagonists are never cocky or cruel in getting their way; rather they use their charm, and occasionally, Spencer's beefy fists if necessary.

The boys head back home in time to hear their father's deathbed wish, that they work together to find their way in the world, rather than constantly bickering.  Their resulting adventures lead them to aid (repeatedly) a lost farming family, pose as federal agents, and get involved in a monks-versus-gunrunners battle.

The general spirit of the film is kind and genial, and for this reason it reminded me of the films of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong heyday.  Much attention is paid to intricate gags (several involving food); there are numerous well-staged and complex fistfights; even a running bit with a flatulent baby that would have seemed right at home in a JC flick.

Terence Hill's Trinity is a happy-go-lucky layabout that is too lazy to even ride his own horse (he prefers to be dragged slowly behind on a makeshift cot).  Trinity is handsome, charming, funny ... a great character to be sure.  Hill is capable of doing intense (e.g., VIVA DJANGO), so his embodiment of Trinity speaks as much to his acting chops as it does his personal charisma.  As for big Bud Spencer, as Bambino he is the sour to Trinity's sweet.  Perennially grumpy, the character owns an underlying air of geniality that seems at odds with his willingness to swing his fists around.  You get the feeling Bambino begins each fight with a big resigned sigh, as if he'd really rather be elsewhere.  The two actors had appeared together in films several times before this series, but it was the Trinity and Bambino personas that really clicked with audiences of the day.

So if you are curious about the fuss over TRINITY, I'd just as soon recommend that you skip right to TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME to get the full gist of Spencer and Hill at their best.  8/10 stars.",1281398400,,2839,4.822314049586777

426010,4,6302099390,"Trinity and Bambino are back at it again, making the west wild.
While it is a B movie, it`s still a very funny western spoof. They set off to be outlaws, but they really are not very good at it.
There is a good running gag all thru the film where they try to rob a farmer and his family that are so poor they end up giving
them money instead of stealing from them.
In the end, the wannabe outlaws end up as the good guys when they run afoul of real hardened outlaws.
Also see another B western called ""They Call Me Trinity"" that comes before this one and a much better western spoof ""My Name is Nobody""
that pairs Terence Hill with Henry Fonda.",1260316800,,644,4.078740157480315

426051,4,6302099390,"This is the second Trinity movie...and like the first (They call me Trinity) it's full of good western fun.

The scene where Trinity and his brother eat in the fancy restaurant is classic and from what I read was made up on-the-spot by the actors, I'm convinced that this scene is where John and Dan from The Blues Brothers got the idea for their fancy resterauant scene as well.

The audio is not as good as the first movie and could have better picture but, it's still worth a trip down Trinity lane.",1122595200,7,502,4.387096774193548
426052,4,6302099390,"A dying father calls his two sons together. He is worried because neither has a respectable price on his head. He encourages the younger, Trinity, to join with his brother to take up an honorable trade like horse thieving. He agrees to do so but the two brothers seem to have a way of failing at crime and, despite their best intentions, helping out the good guys.

The two are mistaken for federal agents in a small town ripe with corruption. This results in the local bad guys offering them substantial bribes to keep from interfering with a smuggling operation. They naturally accept the bribes and use the opportunity to try and steal from the smugglers. Doing so seems to help everybody except the bad guys and our two outlaw aspirants.

As with the previous TRINITY movie, this one is a low budget operation with terrible sound quality and dubbing. That just lends to the air of farce that pervades this comedy.

Buy it for comedic amusement, not for serious western drama.",1118016000,4,979,4.680232558139535
426053,2,6302099390,"Also known as ""All The Way Trinity"" (1972).
  Terence Hill returns in ""Trintiy Is STILL My Name!  This is the sequel to ""They Call Me Trinity"".
  Bud Spencer is a real shock in this one.  He's in a hurry to get through the desert, but when he sees a group of men cooking beans, he takes what he wants from them and the whole skillet of beans.  Terence Hill also rides along and he finds a different group of men.  ""Trinity"" is a bit more nicer, or is he?  he took the beans too.  Even let the horse have some right from the skillet.
  The brothers meet up at Pearl's house.  Where they finally get to take a bath.  At the request of a dying father, Bud has to take care of Terence and show him the ropes.  He is inexperienced at being a bad guy.  But it is Terence that must look after Bud and teach him a thing or two.  Terence finds love too.
  This film is in English on this DVD.  It is the shorter version of 101 minutes.
  Some television versions run a longer version at 1 hour, 57 minutes, still there is an even longer Italian version at 2 hours and 4 minutes.  Rated ""G"".

426054,3,6302099390,"I remember watching several Bud Spencer/Terence Hill films in the early 1980s. This Italian comedy team always provided lots of laughs with the crazy situations each of their films put them in, and these two goofballs were in a lot of different situations, from westerns to car races to cop films. Throughout it all, the formula always stayed the same: Spencer played the taciturn giant who always found himself roped into yet another misadventure by kind hearted Hill. What followed usually involved several awesomely choreographed fistfights, slapstick comedy on a level one rarely sees, and a sappy ending where the two save some unfortunate soul who needed help. I am hoping for a DVD release of ""Crimebusters,"" but until then I will take what I can get from these two funny actors. This means watching films like ""They Call Me Trinity"" and its sequel, ""Trinity Is Still My Name."" ""They Call Me Trinity"" and its subsequent sequels are clever spoofs of the popular spaghetti western genre so prevalent during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the first film, Hill and Spencer rescued a group of Mormons from the malicious plans of a gang of land developers. The second film reunites the brothers for a similarly themed rescue mission.
Trinity (Hill) and his brother Bambino (Spencer) still can't stand one another, but events once again force the two to cooperate as yet another plot aimed at the average man threatens the day. The two first come together again at their parents' house in a series of funny scenes that show how chaotic the brothers' home life must have been as children. Before they even get there, Trinity and Bambino are up to their old tricks. While crossing a desert to get to their parents' place, first Trinity and then Bambino run into a small gang of miscreants camping out behind a giant boulder. Both men manage to outfox these dense goons: Trinity through his fast gunplay and Bambino by bopping one of the guys on the head. Remember this group; they are the first of several running gags in the movie. Anyway, after staying with mom and pop for a time, the two move on together much to the entertainment of Trinity and the consternation of Bambino. They first meet a family heading west that is having difficulty with their wagon. Trinity falls for the beautiful daughter and thus leans on Bambino to help the family out. These people form yet another ongoing gag in the movie, and probably the funniest one. The gassy baby is a hoot.
Naturally, a rumor goes around that Trinity and Bambino are federal agents. The brothers do nothing to counter the accusations, particularly when the head honchos of a criminal gang offer them a bribe to look the other way in a gun smuggling operation. Trinity and Bambino take the money then move to break up the plot. Well, Trinity does, but his brother hates the idea. He's all for taking the money and moving on, an idea frustrated as events pull the brothers' into a hornet's nest involving the criminals and a group of monks. The obligatory fistfight breaks out as the brothers' attempt to thwart the criminals, save the monks, help the pioneer family, and still get away with the money. ""They Call Me Trinity"" ended on the same note, but the final fight here eclipses the big battle at the end of the first film. There must be at least a hundred men punching, kicking, and biting each other in the confines of that church.  Will Bambino finally get away with a big score, or will Trinity once again foil yet another get rich quick scam? Fans of the two actors' films probably know the answer without watching the movie.
""Trinity Is Still My Name"" isn't as good as the first film. In fact, the first film wasn't as good as many of the films made by Hill and Spencer. Maybe it's just me, but I vastly prefer their movies like ""Crimebusters"" to these spaghetti western spoofs. Hill and Spencer still do a good job establishing their characters, riffing off of one another wonderfully as they pick fights with the bad guys in these films, but it's not as much fun watching a fistfight in a church as it is watching one in a bowling alley (where the pair use bowling balls and shoes to knock the opposition senseless). I also tend to get a bit uneasy watching these two eat all those beans-the food looks gross, doesn't it? What are they really eating? That's what I'd like to know! Anyway, most fans of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer will appreciate the antics going on here. My favorite scenes involved Bambino sitting in the bar thinking about what he is going to do about the unfolding situation, and he won't let the owner close up. Every time the guy starts getting ready to leave, Bambino gets up and turns the clock back one hour. Priceless!
Once again, I waded through a Direct Source DVD. What is it with this company that they only release old spaghetti westerns? Worse, the picture quality is always mediocre. For the first ""Trinity"" film, the transfer wasn't too bad, but it's terrible for the sequel. They released an abysmal print of ""Death Rides a Horse."" Too, the only extras are usually a trivia quiz and minimal cast bios. Why a bigger company or studio doesn't jump in and do the old spaghetti western genre justice is a mystery. Perhaps they don't think a market exists for these films. Perhaps they don't want to shell out big bucks to do it. Perhaps they're too busy releasing the director's edition special deluxe super duper extreme version of ""Transylvania 6-5000."" Whatever the case, I hope these old movies find a decent release in the near future.",1086566400,6,5544,4.674513817809621
