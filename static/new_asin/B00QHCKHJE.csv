6867856,4,B00QHCKHJE,"Teeth & Blood is a soon to be classic, camp, horror film.  It captures your attention & imagination from the very beginning as it takes you on a journey of archetypical vampire drama.  You don't have to worry about being scared or bored with this cinematic adventure. You just wonder what theatrical school these actors came from!  The storyline isn't bad and even has satirical, comedic lines every so often.  Additionally the vampires bites could have benefited from more bite.  But it all contributes to Teeth & Bloods perverse appeal.  And again from beginning to end, you're not bored.  Hopefully there will be a sequel.",1426377600,3,625,4.895238095238096
6867857,2,B00QHCKHJE,"I love a good vampire movie and was hoping when I saw Glenn Plummer starring that this would be promising.  But all it turned out to be was a bunch of people getting to show vampire teeth and biting.  At least they weren't ripping chunks out of peoples necks as most B vampire films lately do. Performances were very cardboard and the storyline threw a slew of plot and side stories at you without resolving anything.  If anything the story was more scattered at the end than the beginning.  It looked like it might have potential and then didn't develop.  Disappointing and confusing the overextended plot didn't help.  The storyline - a vampire director is making a vampire movie when his diva is bitten and killed.  She becomes a vampire and runs amok biting others.  The director (Plummer) is getting set to meet with the greedy human mayor for some kind of deal concerning the cities dwindling blood supplies.  He is donating some new facilty while getting control of the old one??  Not real clear on this.  You also have two undercover cops, not very good, working the case of the diva whose body disappeared before it got out of the set and no one is concerned about it.  Also a sub plot about the male undercover cop having something to do with ""something"" oriental?  Never clear.  He supposedly is in some special unit dealing with X-files type cases, but won't explain it to his partner letting her enter unprepared.  Too many questions, not enough answers and nothing resolved.  I hate to say this, but you might want to pass on this and avoid the frustrating ending.",1426118400,2,1578,4.64259927797834
8691299,5,B00QHCKHJE,Nicely Done & Very Bloody & Gory. This time the Vampires have 4 Fangs instead of the Traditional 2 Fangs.,1457654400,,105,4.3
8691300,4,B00QHCKHJE,"The film is surprisingly good. The premise is different enough to be fresh, but the editing could be better. This film shows Black horror is & can be a thing.",1436400000,,158,4.3
8691301,2,B00QHCKHJE,Very lame... :(,1433116800,,15,4.333333333333333
8691302,1,B00QHCKHJE,"Terrible movie, I would not re com end this movie to my worst enemy!!",1432166400,,69,4.0
8691303,3,B00QHCKHJE,"It's ok as far as campy horror goes.
Not terrible, some effort is given by the cast...although the writing is suspect.",1432080000,,118,4.666666666666667
8691304,1,B00QHCKHJE,"After having purchased over 75 movies on Amazon, this is the only one that I have genuinely wanted my money back after buying. The acting is very flat and the story is unoriginal. That is not what bothers me about this film, I can see past all of that. What really frustrates me as a viewer is seeing a B movie that doesn't even try to make it to B - The quality is, by far, the lowest I have seen (and I have seen my fair share of B horror flicks). I am not writing this review to complain or ask for my money back, I am simply writing it because I wish I had seen a review that would've tipped me off that I shouldn't be spending money on a film like this.",1429228800,,658,3.8814814814814813
8691305,5,B00QHCKHJE,Yay finally a new vamp movie worth waiting for it was better then I expected. this is a top notch horror that was well put together and played out. The end was OMG I couldn't believe it. Peeps this is vamps start to finish,1428624000,,222,4.068181818181818
8691306,3,B00QHCKHJE,"Definitely has a lot of cheesy points, and the cinematography and audio could use some work. But overall not too shabby for a low budget film.
It could have been a lot better if these things were pushed.",1428364800,,203,4.368421052631579
8691307,3,B00QHCKHJE,"Vampires are real and are making a movie about vampires. When a woman dies while making the film, Mike Hung (Sean Hutchinson) an X-Files type guy is brought in to investigate. He is teamed up with Sasha (Michelle Van Der Water) who doesn't know she is investigating a vampire ring.

The film is cheesy by design. It is a blaxploitation vampire film because we can never have enough of them. The film was fair. The action was end loaded and should have been spread out better. The acting was bad, perhaps by design.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Typical vampire cleavage.",1427068800,,577,4.647058823529412
8691308,3,B00QHCKHJE,"This movie had a lot of female vampires biting people which of course is always the best. In my opinion every vampire movie should have that, but unfortunately a lot of vampire movies lack that. Anyway if you're looking for a movie that has a lot of female vampires biting people, then this movie is for you. As for the story it was ok. Kind of Dumb",1427068800,,349,4.223880597014926
