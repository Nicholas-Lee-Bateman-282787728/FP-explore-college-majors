3071368,5,B00120WD16,"This DVD has 4 episodes, about 26 minutes each, from her 1975-76 series ""The Shari Show"" about a TV station called ""Bearly Broadcasting"". This was long before that ""Lamb-chop sing-a-long"" [1990s show] so it's annoying that customers would even COMPARE the two. I vaguely remember THIS series [I would've been about 6 or so] but I definitely remember when Shari would come on screen at the end of each episode talking about ""does this ever happen to you?"" She did it in a very funny way as well as making the ""young viewer"" feeling understood. There were a bunch of critter-characters, as well as good ol' Lamb Chop in the cast. The video quality IS of it's era......so you can't compare it with ""HD"" or newer resolutions....or should I say ""definition""? [ugh]

I can't comment on that ""Lamb-Chop [1990s] show because I never saw too many.......but I'm a person who's always liked SHARI LEWIS anyway, she was a very good entertainer. Seeing her as a kid in the 1970s and seeing her various recorded appearances now [even her in that one ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"" episode] are very enjoyable. My hat is always off to Shari!",1398124800,7,1116,4.723076923076923
3071369,2,B00120WD16,"I was really looking forward to sharing my favorite childhood tv person with my four year old grandson. To my great disappointment, Shari and Lambchop weren't even on this video !! It was the other tv characters that I don't even remember!! Afraid to order another one. There should be a notice somewhere. Sigh...",1383091200,,313,4.814814814814815
3071370,5,B00120WD16,"I am so pleased to have obtained this.  I grew up watching Shari and Lambchop.  Even though it says 25 minutes, there is actually an hour and 37 minutes on the DVD.  May not have the fancy special effects of today, but still great for young children.  A plush Lambchop is a must to go along with it.",1337558400,4,299,4.103448275862069
3071371,5,B00120WD16,"I got this for my girlfriend for christmas.  She's a Shari Lewis nut, so she loved it. Very affordable too.",1334448000,4,107,4.35
3071372,5,B00120WD16,"It's so wonderful to have ""The Shari Show"" on DVD for all to enjoy, and it is not only one episode on this DVD, you get four episodes!!  The first and title episode has Shari and her baby (along with the babysitter Auntie Artica) on ""Fun-o-rama"" on another channel, which infuriates Mr. Bearly, but he gets even more furious when the channel offers Shari the job of story person on their channel.  Does Shari accept the job?  You'll have to find out!  Other episodes include Lamb Chop starring in a soap opera, when the actor playing her boyfriend loses his voice, and everyone's last hope is Bugaboo; then there is a bowling tournament in the studio; and then what will happen Mr. Bearly decides to let Captain Person go because of his age?

As said before, this DVD is wonderful and can easily be enjoyed by all.  My favorite episode is the title episode, two reasons:  Shari's storytelling, and Baby Doll (Shari's baby). Shari is such a wonderful storyteller, and she really can make you jump when she shrieks ""NO!!"" as Rumpelstiltskin.  And the scene between Baby Doll and Mr. Bearly is hilarious.  Great DVD for the whole family!!",1313625600,8,1135,4.663316582914573
3071373,5,B00120WD16,Lambchop and Shari Lewis are great childhood entertainment. Funny and educational too. Cute puppets. Great memories of my own childhood and my daughter's too. Worth the price.,1278374400,4,175,5.518518518518518
3071374,5,B00120WD16,I am glad Share Lewis stayed with us long enough to record so much of her work for all children to enjoy and learn her art forever.  She is still the best.,1226361600,9,155,3.84375

3071376,5,B00120WD16,"This show was a little before my time. I was only introduced to Ms. Lewis recently. Sadly, she died of cancer. (God rest her soul) But that said, this dvd is a phenomenal gift that she gave to the world. Her talent with puppets is nothing short of phenomenal! While I have seen puppet shows like the great ""Muppet Show"" and ""Fraggle Rock,"" ""The Shari Show"" is interestingly different. While Shari provides the voices for most of her puppets, she interacts with them as herself. (That is an interesting take.) Moving on, she is the assistant manager to Mr. Bearly (one of her puppets) at Bearly Broadcasting. While she certainly is hilarious, her shows generally have some important lesson in them. The 1st is where Mr. Bearly thinks he can make his tv studio better by: 'putting smiles on the faces of everyone.' (Never mind the fact that his employees may not feel like smiling, and that he doesn't want to hear about it if they don't feel good.) While a hilarious episode, it teaches us an important lesson and inserts just the right amount of sympathy for Mr. Bearly. The 2nd episode is also really great. Mr. Bearly is upset because someone doesn't recognize him, even though he does the broadcasts for the studio. So, he gets the idea to write a memorable jingle and change his image. The 3rd episode is interersting in that time goes back, and Shari is trying to get a job at Bearly Broadcasting. One is entitled to wonder if this reflects Shari getting to know the puppets that she created. The 4th episode is about working together under difficult circumstances. Between the hilarious comedy, the moral lessons, and Shari's outstanding abilities with puppets, there is no reason NOT to get this dvd. Enjoy your everlasting peace Shari.",1211932800,14,1743,4.7368421052631575

Makes me wonder what Shari's REAL daughter thinks of that? [:-)] But Shari's over-all approach to puppets & comedy is as GOOD as anyone else could have done, even by today's standards. [My opinion] The video quality IS of it's era......so you can't compare it with ""HD"" or newer resolutions....or should I say ""definition""? [ugh]
