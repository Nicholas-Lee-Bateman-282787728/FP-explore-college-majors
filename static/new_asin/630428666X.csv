839562,5,630428666X,"""Freeway"" has basically the same premise as ""Little Red Riding Hood."" Except, well, add some drugs, prostitution, psychopathic serial killers, rape, and dead bodies and you've got FREEWAY's premise down  perfectly.
Reese Witherspoon, who is wonderful in the role, is a prime  example of white trash. He mother is a crack addict and a prostitute, who  solicits right outside of the motel they live in. Her evil stepfather, also  a drug addict, sexually abuses her. 15-year-old Vannessa Lutz has been in  countless foster homes, and in almost every one the treatment was no  better. All the trauma in her life has made her a very angry person....and  anyone who stands in her way will pay for it.
One fine day -- while the  whole city seems to be worried about the brutal ""I-5 Killer"" in  the Los Angeles area -- her mother tries to sell herself to the wrong  person -- a police officer. As if that wasn't bad enough, she gets caught  with drugs and paraphenalia. The same happens to the abusive stepfather,  and both deadbeat parents are hauled off to jail. Vannessa escapes her  Social Worker, and steals her car and starts heading up to Northern  California, where she plans to live with her estranged grandmother.
The  fun really begins here. The old clunker of a car Vanessa stole breaks down,  and a friendly psychologist, Bob Wolverton (played wonderfully by the great  Keifer Sutherland) stops to help her. It appears her car is down for the  count, so he offers to take her up to Stockton (where her grandmother is),  because he was heading up that direction anyway. From there, Vanessa  embarks on a crazy, dimented and warped adventure, that will make us laugh  and cringe at the same time.
This film has a certain ""Natural Born  Killers"" taset to it, but pulls off what NBL failed to do (I don't  know about you, but I despised NBL). Perhaps this movie may be considered  as an ""exploitation"" film, but in any case, FREEWAY works in  every way possible.
The directing is superb, and Danny Elfman's score  is highly entertaining, and one of the best (arguably) original scores I've  heard in the 90s.
The dialogue is also beyond belief. Amazing, and even  entertaining lines in this movie. And, ahem, Keifer Sutherland has a cute  little line in this movie that will have you rolling on the floor, and  rewinding fifty billion times.
I highly reccomend FREEWAY. Weather you're  bored or not, you will LOVE this movie, which makes my top ten list.",916704000,11,2455,4.732860520094563
839704,5,630428666X,I own this movie at home. Saw it when it first came out. Had to own it. Every few yrs i watch it again. I give it a 5 because that yr it was a good movie. Today people not like it as much. Some parts are dumb but overall his acting is what sells me on the movie more then her even though i do like her acting as well.,1516492800,,317,3.4788732394366195
839705,5,630428666X,What an awesome and unforgettable movie! Reese Witherspoon is such a bad*ss in this and it is really entertaining watching her play this wild role in a movie.,1516147200,,158,4.678571428571429
839706,1,630428666X,"Bad movie, Just terrible uneventful. Would give it 0 stars if I could",1513036800,,69,4.384615384615385

839708,5,630428666X,"Raw grit and something you won't see from Ms. Witherspoon again, I'm sure.  Such a entertaining flick.",1510531200,,102,5.0
839709,3,630428666X,Ok movie. Good actors and good turn of events. Script was weird at times and kind of boing for the genre.,1510444800,,105,4.0476190476190474
839710,5,630428666X,I can't believe I had never seen this movie before now. Reese is just awesome and plays such a good trailer trash badass. Poorly directed and shot but her acting just really carries this movie all the way through.,1509235200,,213,4.487179487179487
839711,2,630428666X,"A lot of good actors were in this movie, so I had to go back in time and check it out, as well as see what Reese Witherspoon did in the early part of her career.  I started feeling like this was going to be questionable right in the beginning with the intro cartoon Red Riding Hood caricature drawings.
Yes, it is twisted, and 'campy' so I suppose I can't fault it for what it was designed to be, but I'm pretty sure now I don't like that style.  I guess it really is something you either like or don't.  The acting is ok - they did what the script and director asked of them.

Ultimately, If you like realistic dramas, don't bother.  I'm sure they had fun making it.  I just didn't have fun watching it.",1508112000,,704,4.102189781021898

839791,5,630428666X,Loved it,1504915200,,8,3.5
839792,5,630428666X,"In 1996 Reese Witherspoon was not yet a household name (pre- Legally Blonde) and Keifer Sutherland hadn't had a decent role in years. Brooke Shields was underemployed and Brittany Murphy was still alive and not yet a walking skeleton. They are all in this film.

Yes, it is campy. No, it is not a rom-com that Reese has become nearly synonymous with but it is hilariously dark. I loved this movie back then and just watched it again for the first time in more than 15 years. The movie is nearly 20 years old but its awesomeness stands. The teenage me loved it so much I had my own VHS copy and the 20 years on me couldn't watch it without writing this review -  As long as you don't click 'Play' expecting a ""Reese Witherspoon movie"" you will not be disappointed",1504656000,3,762,4.359154929577465
839793,2,630428666X,The acting by Witherspoon is pretty good.  Other characters are plastic.  The plot requires a lot o suspension of reality.,1504310400,,122,5.05
839794,2,630428666X,"This movie is overrated.  It does have it's funny moments. However, it's not very good - for the most part.",1497139200,,107,4.35
839795,2,630428666X,"Although Reese was great actress in this movie. Overall this was a very odd and WEIRD. I wouldn't watch it again for sure. Bad language, rough, jail...didn't leave a good feeling at the end...Don't waste your time.",1493510400,,214,4.8108108108108105
839796,5,630428666X,This is by far one of the most slept on movies ever. this is a twisted story of little red riding hood who has a pretty jacked up life. Vanessa is hilarious and she means no harm shes just trying to make it to her grandmas house. But this wolf (bob) has her messed up and has gotten everything he deserved,1493424000,,305,4.016393442622951
839797,5,630428666X,I cant belive I found this movie been looking for it for a long time never seen it on dvd before fast shipping and good seller,1490832000,,126,3.8846153846153846
839798,5,630428666X,"I have no clue how it has taken me this long to see this film, but let me tell you... From the opening scene to the curtain falls, the movie never fails to deliver. Some seem to have found some of the scenes and/or scriptwriting to be ""cheezy"", or ""obsurd""... I found this aspect to add a strong dynamic that I have rarely, if ever seen in a film before. From the obscure and satirical references made involving race, the justice system and division of class... To the over the top vulgarity, violence, and drug reference... The film will truly have you unable to wait for what is in store for your senses and emotions next. Personally I found myself in tears with laughter one minute, then screaming ""OH YEAH! Give it to the man Reese!"" I also loved the main.  Characters titanium will, especially when it comes down to her understanding of right, wrong and honesty.
It should be said a large population will argue her misunderstanding of said virtues... But in all honesty that fact, among countless others, is what makes this movie such a must see. For people who truly appreciate what the core purpose of cinema is, it is truly a masterpiece. Bravo!",1490486400,7,1153,4.570048309178744

839845,3,630428666X,"I saw four stars and thought that meant a great movie. The only thing vaguely compelling was Reese and her 'creative' language, and surprised it was coming out of her mouth. Thats why I gave it three stars, it should be two.",1490054400,,224,4.357142857142857
839846,3,630428666X,A very strange Red Riding Hood story that takes it out of the children's books and puts it in the dumpster! I enjoyed it and recommend it for someone who wants something a little different.,1490054400,3,189,4.428571428571429

839915,5,630428666X,"The star character, Vanessa, will steal your heart with her courageous heart to survive the rough world and stand up and fight wrongdoing.

840375,5,630428666X,"Within the first few minutes of Freeway we learn of the I-5 Killer, a serial-killer on a murder spree targeting young women. If we can assume the filmmaker knew their business, we can also assume they listened to Chekov: if you hang a gun on the wall in Chapter 1, youd better be ready to use it by Chapter 3.

Then theres the literal gun the heroine receives in the opening act.

Have some faith in Freeway. Both these guns are going off soon enough.

Nobody told me before I watched it that Freeway flopped in the box-office  that it didn't connect with mainstream audiences  or that it developed a ravenous cult-following  that it had more to offer than your average mindless film. Nobody told me anything about it all, actually: I flipped through a slew of listings, thought maybe Freeway was a road-film, and settled back for what I thought would be a Kerouac-ian adventure.

So when the opening rolled to a backdrop of hyper-sexualized Little Red Riding Hood paintings, with the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Keifer Sutherland on the credits, I didn't know what the hell to think. How was it that in twenty-six years of existence Id never once heard of this movie, with big names (that my generation grew up on) starring in the lead roles? And what does Little Red Riding Hood have to do with it?

Which gets back to the title of this review. Trigger Warnings: Everything.

Reese Witherspoon stars as Vanessa Lutz, a teen with a sub-kindergarten reading level and the worst sort of home life. Troubled doesnt begin to cover it. Her mothers a prostitute; her step-fathers an ex-con on parole with an obvious predilection for pedophilia. Both are addicted to narcotics (crack or meth, I assumed, though Ill be the first to admit my absolute ignorance of hard drugs and associated paraphernalia). Vanessas boyfriend seems to be the most positive, stable influence in her life, and hes a gang-banger. Were rammed straight into this degradation within the first few scenes, and the writers don't pull any punches. Nor does it let up; if anything the degeneracy and crudity only amplify throughout the story, dropping without any consideration for the consequences the exact kind of four-letter words which land you in hot water with the ratings board.

Watching the backdrop unfold left me with that sick feeling you get when you step barefoot on dog crap: technically youve not been harmed in any way, but you're violated and soiled regardless.

And despite all that, Witherspoon already brought a fiery effervescence to the role. Not to say Vanessas bubbly about her life, but she rolls with the punches without becoming a punching bag. Case in point: when her step-father (fresh off a hit from the crack-pipe) tries to fondle her, Vanessa snaps at him without hesitation, and then calmly resumes watching television as if nothing happened.

So when the cops raided the house and hauled her parents off to jail, it didn't come as any surprise when Vanessa  slyly, but with an almost naive contrition and genuine innocence  cuffs the child-services agent to a bedpost and skips town.

When Vanessa hastily packs her get-away bag, its all a red basket. And shes wearing her red jacket. And off to see her grandmother.

Kiefer Sutherland stars opposite as Bob Wolverton, a seemingly kindly, well-intentioned counselor who Vanessa meets during her getaway. When her car breaks down, Sutherland pulls over to offer assistance, and when its clear the car is donezos even offers her a ride up to LA. Hes dressed in a professorial tweed jacket, elbow patches and all. For a moment I thought wed seen our Lawful Good character at long last. Someone whod shine a light on all this filth surrounding Vanessa, whod offer her a way out. When he begins to counsel Vanessa and she opens up about her challenging childhood and abuse, it seems someone at last has taken a keen interest in Vanessas wellbeing.

Well, I was right about half of it, anyways. We had Little Red Riding Hood. And we had the grandmother.

Theres only one other character in the fairy-tale, folks.

In the drama that ensues, Sutherland and especially Witherspoon bring a complexity and skill to their respective roles that Id never have expected in a million years. I know Witherspoon best from Legally Blond, which my mother must have watched on VHS a hundred times throughout my childhood, and Sutherland of course will always be Agent Jack Bauer in my eyes. Not to detract from either character, actors, or productions  I enjoyed Legally Blond as much as any pre-teen whos seen it dozens of times can, and I ate up 24 even in its worst seasons  but I didn't expect anything Oscar-worthy from Sutherland or Witherspoon.

The American public wasn't ready for it, and neither were the censorship ding-dongs, but Freeway is nothing short of dramatic gold.

Sutherland and Witherspoone play two characters taken to 11, larger than life personalities, and they leave it all on the field in these performances. Two titans (albeit very different people) pitted one against the other as the plot twists and turns through the sordid affair. There wasn't any other obvious reason I should be enthralled by Freeway  nothing special about the cinematography or scoring, and the sets are LA backlots in typical Hollywood fashion  and if Im being honest, my inner snob wanted to hate Freeway for its crudeness if nothing else.

But I couldn't not like it. Witherspoon and Sutherland, whether you like or despise their characters, are too engaging and demanding of your emotional investment to truly hate Freeway.

At the box-office Freeway failed to bring in more than a tenth of its modest budget, estimated at around 3 million. By commercial standards, it was a failure. Maybe audiences in 1996, hip-deep in the prosperous dot-com bubble, couldn't connect.

But when they write the textbooks for film students of the future, this is one theyd do well to include.",1473120000,,5914,4.863545816733068

I didn't read the synopsis of the movie before I watched, so the opening credits were just spectacular and strange to me, but finishing the movie the way it did, it now makes complete sense and makes me laugh every time I think about it.

Witherspoon is a match for Lucille Ball, and I'm not saying that without knowing what the comparison means. You have all the film actresses who ever played comedic roles at the foot of the mountain, and Lucy is at the top. And Witherspoon is standing there with Lucy.

I wish Witherspoon would just forget about making serious films, and focus solely on comedies. I'm not saying she's not good in the serious films, only that she has a major gift for comedy.",1434931200,,731,4.755905511811024

841526,5,630428666X,"Reese's best movie in my opinion. How is writer/director Matthew Bright's classic not on blu-ray? I would even settle for an anamorphic DVD at this point. Every edition of this movie on DVD is formatted for letterboxed 4x3 meaning on a 16x9 monitor you get black borders on all four sides of the image; worth repeat viewings nevertheless. Imagine Red Riding Hood told through the prism of John Waters. Bright, who was once a member of The Mystic Knight of the Oingo Boingo, also wrote and starred in Forbidden Zone which would be a pretty great double feature with Freeway. The humor is about as black as it gets and if graphic language and violence offend you then you should pass this one over. Showed this one to my wife when we started dating, she asked me if there were any more like this one that she hadn't heard of. Sorry sweetie, they just don't make 'em like this very often.

The actors are superb in their roles. The storyline is amazing, little red riding hood meets the wolf.

841631,4,630428666X,"A Classic. A well paced fantastical telling of the Little Red Ridinghood tale but in this one, Red Ridinghood IS little, but she should have a dragon tattoo. She is illiterate ""trailer trash"" and knows it. After raising a dollop of Cain she finds herself in a station wagon with a murderous predator who is being sought as the ""I 5 killer"" who murders young women along the SO.Cal. Interstate five corridor and whose cover is a well established, respectable psychologist and a middle class guy he can indulge his serial murdering proclivities with impunity--Kieffer plays it with a bit of of tongue-in-cheek.
 I re-view the tale every couple of years just to see where Reese Witherspoon got her start (at least to my awareness). The very loose ends only come to mind after Kiefer's character has gotten his just reward at Grandma's house (trailer); here Red is unperturbed when she finds the ""I5 killer"" in grandma's bed, saying ""Oh,its you. Bob.""  The credits are rolling and fact that Red has slashed. choked, hand-cuffed and humiliated half of those who are paid to ""look after"" her is not a distraction.

This movie certainly got her ready to spew venom and vulgarity at the officer. The movie is mediocre at best and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a movie all the way through without the f bomb and sexually explicit content. I can't believe that Keifer would stoop to this. As for Reese, actions and foul language have spoken very well for her in the movie and real life.
Stinker for sure. I will admit to a few comic scenes, mostly because these characters were so very stupid. This is definitely not for children to watch and not for the faint of heart. As far as this delinquent girl ever going to a traditional foster home, well, forget it. She wouldn't have even qualified for a therapeutic foster home.

842222,5,630428666X,"I absolutely loved this very, VERY dark and violent comedy, which by its general atmosphere and kind of humor reminded me strongly of ""True Romance"" and a little bit of ""Pulp Fiction"". Limited SPOILERS below.

This is the story of Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon), a 16 years old girl living with her mother (a crack addict and a prostitute) and her stepfather (a crack addict and petty thief). She is half-illiterate but very street-wise and resourceful. At one moment, after a particularly bad day, she decides to run away and go live with her paternal grandmother. But on the way she meets a certain Bob Wolverton (Kieffer Sutherland), a charming, gentle, helpful man, with a wide smile and really big teeth... What follows, is for you to discover, but let me tell you - you are in for a wild ride!

This film was made before Reese Witherspoon big break, so she really put everything she had or could borrow in her acting, and believe me, she is INCREDIBLE! Without the slightest doubt, this is her best role ever! Kieffer Sutherland is as good, even if his character is a little bit more typical and therefore more previsible. Brooke Shields plays a smaller but important role of Bob' wife. Amanda Plummer (famous for her role of Hunny Bunny in ""Pulp Fiction"") is absolutely amazing as Vanessa'a mum. And finally, there is Brittany Murphy, who plays a small role, but steals the show in every scene she appears in! Frankly, she completely impressed me in this film - it is such a pity that she left us so young...

The major strength of this film is in the incredible, clever, frequently funny and sometimes surrealistic dialogs, which bear strong resemblance to those from ""True Romance"" and sometimes also from ""Pulp Fiction"". It is understandable as director and writer of ""Freeway"", Matthew Bright, made his life mostly as scenario writer before trying his luck in directing. Considering that ""Freway"" was his first film, it is a pity that for some reason his career didn't take off, as his next three films were complete failures and he didn't turn anything since 2003.

Although dialogs are great, be advised that they are extremely obscene and by moments very shocking, quasi pornographic - and therefore this is film for adults only. Also, this film is very politically incorrect (an asset as far as I am concerned) and some more violent moments can be pretty disturbing. Finally, the whole climate of the film as well as the main character (Vanessa) are moraly very... well, questionnable. It is good, solid entertainment - but not for all tastes.

Botom line, this is an excellent, very surprising and by moments extremely funny film, with top level dialogs and a bunch of great actors. I absolutely keep my DVD to a re-watch. Enjoy - if you dare!",1359417600,,2761,4.779874213836478

842338,5,630428666X,"Pros:  BLACK humor, denseness of detail, and sincerity of vision
Cons:  unsuitable for children or the timid
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot

I have MANY favorite scenes in this incredible movie, but two stand out:

First: In the opening sequence, Reese Witherspoon's character, Vanessa Lutz, is in her Special Ed class for illiterates, sitting on her black boyfriend's lap. The teacher calls on Vanessa to read a sentence chalked on the board: 'The cat drinks milk,' or something equivalent. The teacher has to spoon feed Vanessa each letter, (""C, Vanessa"" ""c"" ""Now A"" ""a"" . . .) and praises her when she finally finishes repeating it back, as if Vanessa had read it herself instead of merely regurgitating it. The entire class of misfits explodes in applause of Vanessa's 'accomplishment' as she and her boyfriend commence deep-tonguing each other in celebration.

Second: When Vanessa walks into court, on trial for ""abducting"" and maiming the Big Bad Wolf (Bob Wolverton as played by Kiefer Sutherland) she takes one look at his mutilated face (her own enthusiastic handiwork) and bursts into peals of laughter. ""Hey Bob!"" she shouts with glee. ""Looks like someone beat you with the UGLY stick!""

They say there are no new stories, only retellings of the old in new ways. Of COURSE this is a white trash, late 20th Century retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. Director Matthew Bright could have left it at that and people would have nodded, said ""Isn't that nice?"" and moved along. But he embellishes it with almost rococo detail, so many telling little sequences and scenes and background characters, some of them only occupying a few seconds of screen time. The strangeness and authenticity of the Film's MANY nuances are reminiscent of Lynch at his best. The attention to small, fast details calls the abundant creativity of 'The Simpsons' to mind.

This film is a roller coaster ride, one of the finest black comedies I have ever seen. Hilarious, entertaining, disturbing, and impossible to stop watching.

Proviso: NOT for the kiddies, or for anyone that might be heartbroken at seeing Jared of 'The Pretender' as a tattooed, crack smoking child molester, living off his wife's earnings as a prostitute.",1331251200,,2252,5.018766756032171

'Freeway' has many strong characterizations and each and every character in the film is believable and you can see situations from their individual perspectives very easily. Reese Witherspoon's performance will make you go speechless, this is without a doubt, one of her most unique films and she leaves no effort in doing justice to her character. she is not the 'romantic lady' you have always known her to be in most films, well neither she is the actress Reese Witherspoon on screen as well, she is simply 'Vanessa' a brutally honest teenage girl whom we can easily relate to. Witherspoon completely breathes life into the role of Vanessa and makes the viewer easily wonder if it is Reese on screen or this illiterate girl called Vanessa. The rest of the cast deliver brilliant performances as well and above all Keither Sutherland is simply a delight to watch, his expressions are enough to keep you terrified. Overall, a very, very honest film that requires an open mind and heart, very few films creates a natural atmosphere and characters that draw your whole mind and soul towards the screen. The best part is, the film maintains a fine balance between humor and drama. One of those very, very rare gems of cinema. A must watch!",1326499200,,1409,4.802469135802469

842517,4,630428666X,"Freeway (1996), is an extraordinary, hyper-scary movie  that thinks
nothing of  delving into taboo subjects, sordid fascinations that too
often are swept under the rug in our society... anarchy, juvenile
delinquency, shootings, chaos of cities, etc. For that reason, perhaps this film
should be rated not 17, or 21 but perhaps 30 or 35, such
is the graphic nature of the filming, the language, the underlying taboo
subjects touched upon that only jaded, ""men of the world"" would hesitantly
admit exists or discuss in today's society. e.g. drive by shootings,
the constant need for the justice system to redress certain extreme behaviors
from extreme individuals, commercialism, etc

The filming is great, with its wide-screen format, although the music is very
minimal or invisible in the context of the underlying story.

Reese Witherspoon's character is outstandingly played by the actress, as an
agressive,  stressed out 17 year old raised in a broken home, (with all that
entails), and the vicious circle seems to repeat itself, despite herself,
as she falls into the same pattern of life occurrences as everyone in her family
did in the past,  although she  sees it coming a mile away, from having been
around the block a few times. Her charisma and youthful energy are a plus.

Kiefer Sutherland's choice in volunteering for this picture, lends it credibility
as entertainment, but  ...the audience will be challenged and baffled for the
actor not having minded to be portrayed as a psychologist who loves
his job of listening to the emotional despair of his clients during therapy,
as the same time as he has immense  personal skeletons in the closet, 100 times
fold more serious than any of those he's counseling.

Amanda Plummer, does a perfect job in the role of Reese's mother, which is
of a methampetamine addict, doing tricks for cash, while  Dan Hedaya is
fine as a  modest police detective just trying to get to the bottom of
things.

A winner of the Cognac Police Festival in France, the same year it was
released, Freeway has an impact which is  entertaining, but a lot more
as a  shocking experience to viewers, almost every 5 minutes, as almost every
aspect of personal behavior shown offers  no limits, no filters, no
restraint.  It's a  certain ""Reality"" in America, which is absolutely real:
the penal system, out of bounds behavior, the consequences, real casualties
from youths who have access to Saturday Night Specials, etc.

The upshot, is that this movie is a must-see, but jaws will drop to the ground over
and over again, over 90 mins.",1216684800,2,2565,4.9485981308411215

Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Vanessa is realistic and totally believable.  You walk away being mad at her for being so vicious, but you can't blame her one bit because of her miserable life.  I can't believe Reese Witherspoon was never recognized for this performance. Kiefer Sutherland is also fantastic.

It's loaded with violence but not sex (awww) and, on its surface, seems to be little more than The B Movie That Could. The difference is that it's all a sort of joke. The kind where the writer/director is giving a wink to the audience that ""gets it"" and a middle finger to those that don't. I'll admit I fell somewhere in between. I watched the movie cold, meaning I had no idea what it was about but I picked up on the ""Riding Hood"" theme instantly and that kept me watching the entire movie just to see how they handled the major beats of the fairy tale.

Freeway doesn't adhere to Riding Hood in any strict sense and the deviations are much to the advantage of the production. This is one of Witherspoon's earliest roles and she carries the entire film, successfully, upon her shoulders.

842638,5,630428666X,"Better than both ""Seven"" and ""Natural Born Killers"", director Matthew Bright's ""Freeway"" is a looseleaf modern view of Red Riding Hood where Reese Witherspoon plays Red traveling to Grandma's house.

Only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested, she escapes the cluthces of foster care, she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting, she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer, she kills a few people, ends up in lockup, escapes, finally makes it to Gradma's house, where some more bloody action takes place.

Oh yes, she has homosexual and heterosexual sex, spends a lot of time saying the ""F"" word, brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way, and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody. Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role, eh? No, not by a long shot.

But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic, out of this world great. She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash, for which she won an Oscar as best actress. On the basis of these roles, Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now.

As the description here and on Amazon indicates, this movie presses the envelope of the ""R"" rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17. There is gory, bloody violence throughout this film, nudity and more ""F"" and ""F""ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard. Someone told me they said ""F"" 147 times in that movie. Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here.

But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene, where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom's out earning a living. There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization, too, although it's clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays.

In an astonishing bit of casting, squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight, upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland, whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon's. While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out, Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities. Other players, incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place, contribute a lot to this film.

This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist. There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie; much of it seems upside down. But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene, action you may never have seen in a film before.",1162684800,64,2859,4.894628099173554
842709,5,630428666X,"A 15-year-old illiterate girl named Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon, about 19 at the time) lives in a crummy motel with her lunatic, methadone-addicted, prostitute mother (Amanda Plummer in an incredible performance) and crack-smoking, child-molesting step father (Michael T. Weiss, of The Pretender, as you have never seen him....before or since). When mom and dad get arrested for about the 100th time, poor young Vanessa evades Child Protective Services custody, gets a gun from her black, gangster fiance (Bokeem Woodbine) who can't join her because of a parole hearing in the morning and who is immediately murdered in a drive-by shooting, and, wearing a red jacket and carrying a basket, she heads for Grandma's house (ala Little Red Riding Hood), only to have car trouble and be picked up by the dreaded I-5 rapist, pederast, and serial murderer (Keiffer Sutherland)....now here is the best part: this is a COMEDY !!!

Granted, it is the blackest of dark comedies, but make no mistake, this gem offers some of the most hilarious dialog and situations you will even see on film. Brilliantly written and directed by newcomer Matthew Bright, it features superb performances by a remarkable cast, including an almost unrecognizable Brittany Murphy as a deranged, paint-sniffing lesbian with a face that is hacked up like a post-Christmas ham.

Possibly due to its unorthodox tone and content, this 1996 masterpiece never received the marketing and public release it deserved, but was still selected by critics (including Roger Ebert) as one of the finest films of the year.

If you want to see a performance by Reese Witherspoon that makes all her subsequent roles, including Ring of Fire, look like high school plays, then please give this DVD a try. It isn't the cute, cuddly, predictable Reese of recent times, but an infinitely more entertaining, gun-toting, butt-kicking, foul-mouthed wild woman who doesn't take kindly to those who dare to treat her with disrespect. Like Kill Bill and True Romance, this movie features strong women in situations where attempted victimization by men inevitably leads to mayhem....and a lot of dead, disfigured men.

This is a very special movie that will appeal to those who enjoy the gritty action and dark comedic aspects of movies like Pulp Fiction, True Romance, and Kill Bill. Matthew Bright hit a major home run on his first time up to bat and has, unfortunately, struck out since. His DVD commentary track will help you understand and appreciate the intricacies of this truly great movie and the personal, somewhat bizarre eccentricities of the director who made it all happen.",1155168000,81,2627,5.130841121495327

TO THE MOVIE!  It uses the story structure of little red riding hood and changes the wolf into a real man in this movie who just so happens to also be a rapist, murderer and pedophile.  As you can tell the story has now become quite adult in it's telling and is not for kids as the rating would let you know. TO THE TITLE OF MY REVIEW!  Yes, this is an artsploitation movie meaning that it actually has artistic goals and it obviously has some dirtier ones as well, but what makes most of the film compelling is the performance by Reese Witherspoon who makes the films highs and lows poignant even when they're outlandishly warped and humorous in a dark way.  There are times when the film fails at its attempts by going for too much, and at other times it hits hard and accurately.  This is not a perfect, or consistent film, but it is entertaining in a very askewed way.  When this film was supposed to be released in the United States the company that made it balked at putting it in theatres thinking that it wouldn't find an audience, which may be true because of its outlandishness, however, it wasn't given a chance.  It had a very short one or two week run at one theatre and was rushed to video.  Even Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times was surprised at the corporate decision since he felt Witherspoon's performance in this film was one of the breakout performances of that year. Well, you can't keep a good woman down and she broke through with another movie and continues to do good work, but I don't she'll be able to top this movie because the roles she's taking now are based on her star power and are mainstream vehicles.  She's supporting kids now and I don't think she has the latitude, or time to accept these roles that are far more marginal in appeal and risky, but I'm glad that she made this film and in a strange way I'm glad that the film didn't make money at the box office so I could purchase it for $5 at Best Buy and be surprised at how good it was.  If you are an easily offended person of good taste in film, don't watch the movie, if you're a mainstream person seeking out Reese films, don't watch it.  If you're a casual film watcher looking for a feel good film, don't watch it.

842769,5,630428666X,"This is the best modern interpretation of Little Red Riding Hood to date. What if Red Riding Hood were trailer trash taking the family jalopy to Grandma's house in order to avoid getting put in foster care? What if the wolf were a serial killer that picked up girls along the particular freeway which lead to Grandma's house?

Reese Witherspoon is Red Riding Hood, or Vanessa Lutz, as she is named in this incarnation of the Grimm girl. Her momma (Amanda Plummer) turns tricks for drug money, while her stepdaddy (Michael T. Weiss) is a child molesting addict sitting around the motel in which they live, watching TV and getting trashed. When both of her parents are arrested, quick thinking Vanessa informs the police that she has a grandmother in Stockton that will take her in so that she can avoid getting shuffled into the system. Mind you, she isn't lying, but she has no idea how grandma will feel about her arrival. So, she basically escapes the P.O. and leaves it all behind, including her boyfriend, a hood rat that happens to be black. This fine point becomes important later on, so pay attention.

Unfortunately, the road to grandma's is fraught with danger due to the ""I-5 Killer"", and our Red Riding outta da 'hood breaks down on the way there. She accepts the ride from the cleverly named Mr. Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland), and all hell breaks loose.

Witherspoon is convincing, hilarious, tough, and intelligent despite gross ignorance of a lot of things, including the concept of literacy. Sutherland is a very scary man, and I could never have imagined anyone else in this role. Brooke Shields plays Mrs. Wolverton, a wife in denial of her serial killer husband's double life, and she is perfectly (and surprisingly) neurotic, and memorable in her relatively small role. Look for Brittany Murphy in the girls' facility as a lesbian nympho who's done way too many drugs. There's a classic fight scene in the prison there too that left me slackjawed the first time I saw it. Heh. It was great.

A darkly hysterical take on the old fairy tale, this is not for the feint of heart or easily offended. For those who can hack it, this is probably one of the most underrated comedy-thrillers of all time.

842773,5,630428666X,"While watching this film I was disgusted, disturbed, and horrified while all the while LOVING THIS FILM.  Living in a house where fairy tale literature is commonplace (my wife studies Children's Literature), I was surprised by this film.  Seeing it in the value bin at most video stores, I expected poor production, horrible direction, and a pathetic cast.  We have all seen these films that boast big names, but somehow never fully follow through.  Freeway is nothing of the kind.  It is a carefully written and delivered retelling of one of our most beloved fairy tales with a extremely dark twist.

Reece Witherspoon (pre-Legally Blonde) gives a performance that surprised me.  I did not realize that she was so capable of bringing this character to life.  Her counterpart, the illustrious ""Wolf"", played by 80s child Keifer Sutherland, is yet another powerful force in this film.  The two of them nearly carry this film on their shoulders.  This is one of those perfect examples of a film that did not have much publicity after its release, but has since then obtained ""cult"" status through avid viewer's word of mouth.  This is definitely a film for all movie critics, film buffs, and fanatics to gaze at just once.  I know there were some poor reviews when it was first released, but I am sure that a second viewing would bring this gem back to life.

I would also like to add that director Matthew Bright is a film genius.  He successfully took a very wholesome and good natured story (or that we think) and transforms it into the fearsome dark story that it should be.  Our society has the consistency of taking dark elements and transforming them into stories for our children.  A wolf eats a grandmother in this story ... how happy and uplifting is that?  I applaud Bright for taking this story and transforming it into a modern day fairy tale.  It is gripping, fascinating, and downright beautiful.

If you enjoyed Natural Born Killers and was hoping for a nicer twist, this film is your answer.  I also suggest that if you couldn't get enough of Freeway that you try to get your hands on the very rare Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby.  See how Bright delicately transforms yet another dark fairy tale (Hansel and Gretel) into a modern masterpiece.

Reese Witherspoon steals the show as Vanessa, the tough-as-nails teenager who is part trailer-park trash and part avenging angel.  On my honor as a serious film buff, I consider her performance the best I've seen from any actress, ever! Its too bad she failed to live up to her potential by choosing safe, boring roles once she attained stardom.  Keifer Sutherland nails his role as the psychotic Bob Wolverton, although a number of actors could have played the part just as well.  That being said, this film is not for everyone.  There are several scenes that are extremely difficult to watch, especially those with Vanessa & her family--""Legally Blond"" its not.  Despite this, its also surprisingly moral at times.  And subtle too--if you blink, you'll miss the scene where Vanessa flashes a picture of her father:  Richard Speck, the infamous serial killer.

842775,4,630428666X,"Well, if you were ever curious about what a psychotic retelling of the LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD fairy tale would look like, here's your chance to quench your imaginative appetite.  I was not exactly sure what I was getting into when I bought this flick but don't worry: you won't know what you're in for, either.

In this case Little Red Riding Hood is played by Reese Witherspoon.  Unfortunately, she comes from a Dysfunctional family (with a capital ""D"").  With no place to go except foster care (gasp!) she decides to go visit grandma.

Along her way she's picked up by the big bad wolf (portrayed by Keifer Sutherland).  They have a rather bizarre ride and then things really get interesting.  What does all this have to do with the children's story?  You'll have to watch to find out!

There is a Brooke Shields sighting as she plays Mrs. Big Bad Wolf.  All of the actors in the film seem to have fun with the movie;  you could tell in their acting that they had a good time making this macabre, twisted adult fairy tale.

If you're in the mood for something ""different"" this movie might be for you.  A word of caution, however:  FREEWAY is not for the squeamish.  It does not score very high on the scale of good taste, and it's obvious they meant it to be that way.  If, however,  you choose to take the next exit and get on the FREEWAY, hang on for the ride of your life!",1095379200,19,1377,4.358267716535433
842776,5,630428666X,"Reese Witherspoon may just be our next Jodie Foster.  Remember Jodie's breakthrough performance in TAXI DRIVER?  Afterwards, she ended up doing fluff roles until she landed her Oscar.  So here comes Reese in FREEWAY, giving a blow-away Oscar caliber performance and then she's off to LEGALLY BLONDE and SWEET HOME ALABAMA.  Go figure, huh?

Anyway, Witherspoon fans who may remember her wonderful performance in MAN IN THE MOON may be surprised at this star turn.  Alternately cute, silly and vacuous, hardhearted, cold and brutal, Reese gives a performance that elevates this film to a level of bizarre excellence.  She seems awfully wise for her fifteen years.  Witherspoon owns the screen and she is just amazing in the role.

Other cast members are great, too:  Bokeem Woodbine as her fiance, whose criminal past interrupts any wedding plans; Michael T. Weiss as her disgusting stepfather who brings pedophilia to a new low; Amanda Plummer as her drug addicted/prostitute mother, who does tricks right outside the motel where they live; Dan Hedaya as the seasoned veteran cop who seems amused with Reese at times; Wolfgang Boddison as his partner, a young and cynical man, who meets his match in Reese; Brittany Murphy as the somewhat retarded lesbian inmate who seems so real you forget she's acting; and, of course, the ubiquitous Kiefer Sutherland, once again playing the kind of sadistic heel he does so well.  In this one, Kiefer outdoes himself moving from a polite counselor to the heinous serial killer.  Even Brooke Shields as Sutherland's kewpie doll wife gives a good performance.

From the opening titles, you can surmise that this is a takeoff on Little Red Riding Hood, and it's analogy is perfect.

Reese will win an Oscar some day and it will be for a movie like this, and not the empty-headed comedies.  She deserves one!",1094342400,,1842,4.973856209150327
842777,3,630428666X,"Freeway (1996), written and directed by Matthew Bright, takes the classic tale of Little Red Riding Hood, infuses it with part Jerry Springer, part America's Most Wanted to create a highly disturbing, yet often times satirical, dark look at our collective fascination with serial killers.
The film stars Reese Witherspoon as Vanessa Lutz, a somewhat illiterate 15-year-old California girl whose life is anything but a bowl of cherries.  Her mother (Amanda Plummer) is a drug-addicted prostitute, working just outside the motel where the family lives, while her step-dad Larry, played by Michael Weiss (The Pretender), is a lecherous, alcoholic, drug abusing parolee who has spent more of his life in prisons than out.  Trouble develops when Vanessa's mother gets arrested, along with her stepfather, and Vanessa is headed into the foster care system once again.  Deciding to forgo the system, Vanessa escapes, trying to make her way to her paternal grandmother, a woman she's never met, but figures it's got to be better than the alternative.
Upon breaking down on the freeway, she meets Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) who offers assistance in a ride.  The man seems a bit too helpful (at least to me), but Vanessa takes Bob up on his offer.  We learn Bob is some sort of councilor, and he begins to probe (figuratively speaking) Vanessa about her family problems, getting her to discuss more and more details.  She trusts him initially, given that it is usually easier to discuss highly personal matters with a complete stranger than those closest to you, but, when Bob begins to get too explicit, Vanessa tries to walk away, to which Bob's true colors come through.  You see, there's a serial killer on the loose, one whose target appear to be young women picked up on the freeway.  As Vanessa determines that Bob is in fact the killer, she manages to escape, but not before shooting Bob a number of times, leaving him for dead.  But Bob doesn't die...he's severely messed up, but doesn't die.
Soon Vanessa is picked up by the police, as Bob, now a victim, and his wife (played by Brook Shields) aggressively press for the prosecution of Vanessa as an adult.  It's no surprise to Vanessa that the police are reluctant to by into her version of the events, seeing only a troubled youth who viciously shot and then robbed a man trying to assist her.  As the authorities try to determine whether or not they can prosecute Vanessa as an adult, she manages to escape, and makes her way towards her grandmother's house, while the police, finding new evidence to support Vanessa's story, begin investigating Bob, who has since gone missing.
I've given you a fair synopsis so far, but I left out a lot of things, like the dark, comedic elements, the graphic violence, and the incredible amount of profanity.  Reese Witherspoon does a wonderful job, presenting an interminably cute, yet violent and brutal when she needs to be, product of her environment.  Her character seemed very similar to the one she played in a later film, Election (1999), except a lot trashier, but less devious.  Kiefer Sutherland seemed to enjoy his role, presenting an initially suave exterior hiding a fairly hideous and disgusting individual, full of contempt and thoughts of uber-violence.  His visage after suffering the attack from his would be victim nicely matched what I felt the character to be like on the inside, disturbing, disgusting, and intensely grotesque.  The supporting cast including Dan Heyda, Bokeem Woodbine, and Brittany Murphy all add nicely to this intensely out-of-whack modern day version of the little girl in red and the big, bad wolf.  One can't help notice influences of Oliver Stone's 1994 surrealistic nightmare Natural Born Killers within this film, and I wasn't surprised to learn Mr. Stone was actually an executive producer for Freeway.  While lacking the intense, skewed, and sometimes confusing visual imagery of Natural Born Killers, Freeway does share it's darkly comedic elements, holding little back from its audience.  As I said, the violence is more of the visceral sort, but I did notice in many instances the aftermath of the violence was shown, rather than the actual act as it happened.  The amount of profanity seemed a bit extreme at times, but it was there for a reason (what that reason is, I am unsure).  With elements in film like this, I am usually of the opinion that less is more, in that a subjective placement of such language in certain areas of the movie can create the shocking elements desired rather than large quantities spread throughout.
The quality of the print here looks very good in wide screen format, and the audio is excellent.  Not much in the way of special features other than a commentary track by the writer/director and a theatrical trailer.  The price for this DVD is certainly attractive, but know that it earns its' 'R' rating, and certainly isn't for everyone.

842839,5,630428666X,"There is nothing sacred in FREEWAY. Movies like this get your friendly neighborhood ""family values"" handwringers drooling in righteousness. Oliver Stone was executive producer, which may be one reason why it feels just like an one of his movies. Yet I think its far better than the self-indulgent NATURAL BORN KILLERS (definitely superior to U-TURN). Its pretenses are much lower, and then there's Reese Witherspoon.
This is possibly her best performance; she definitely doesn't play it safe here. An endearing, sociopathic and illiterate 15-year old who ""had an anger problem, but not any more."" It's fun to think of the LEGALLY BLONDE fanatics renting this and being horrified at their princess turning tricks and having a black boyfriend. At the same time, she really does do interesting movies. ELECTION is way different, yet I think is a great companion to this movie with its dark, subversive humor. AMERICAN PSYCHO and CRUEL INTENTIONS are by no means good movies, but we're not talking Sandra Bullock's stuff here.
Anyway, FREEWAY is in its own class, taking urban white trash clich?s in absurd and droll directions. Vanessa Lutz's prostitute mother, pederast step-father and their crack rocks are taken away by the County cops, and she just wants to get to grandmother's trailer park where everything will be okay. (Her dream sequence, with a trailer park paradise with kitsch giraffe statutes makes for an hysterical ideal) So she sets off, on the I-5 in southern California. She eventually falls into the hands of bourgeois child therapist and ambitious serial killer Bob Wolverton (Keifer), who manipulates her into talking about herself. This is one of the best parts of the movie.
Sutherland is fine as the wolf. The two detectives are hilarious. Dan Hedaya as the slightly bemused older guy, and Wolfgang Bodison as the patronizing young guy who Vanessa beats the crap out of at one point.
Strange moral debates constantly play out in the subtext of the movie, and I think enhance its humor. There are few well-written movies that even approach the black humor and socially sacriligeous quality of this movie. It's up there with REPO MAN and WAY OF THE GUN. Director Matthew Bright's commentary is pretty interesting, especially talking about the dynamics of filming on a very limited budget. Also, through his constant remarks about girls, girls' hair, Reese, and hints of his own perversions, he comes across as a very weird fellow on his own. So it is worth listening to if you're a fan of the movie.",1086652800,4,2518,5.011933174224343

There's so many good one liners (""Do you wanna get shot a whole buncha times?!"") and just generally funny characters (the mildly-retarded yet aggressive lesbian).  If it is a commentary on society, it's not commneting on the media, but on the modern-day family unit.  An interesting note is that the picture Vannessa shows Bob of her father is actually a picture of a convicted serial murder Richard Speck.

842847,3,630428666X,"Freeway (Matthew Bright, 1996)
Matthew Bright, recently responsible for the Ted Bundy film (one of a slew of serial killer bio flicks quickly released after the success of Chopper), made, as his debut, a twisted auto wreck of a movie that should have had some sort of catchy tagline like ""hitch a ride on the freeway of stupidity!"" Nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and getting Reese Witherspoon a slew of Best Actress nods from various alternative film critics, the movie really is like a particularly gruesome auto accident; you feel guilty, but you can't look away.
Witherspoon (back when she was still taking chances with her career) plays Vanessa Lutz, a fifteen-year-old illiterate reform school student with a very, very bad home life. Her mother (Amanda Plummer, playing the exact opposite of her character in The Prophecy) is a hooker, turning tricks outside the motel where they live; her stepfather (Michael T. Weiss, unrecognizable in these pre-Pretender days) spends the time while his wife is out working the streets smoking crack and sleeping with his stepdaughter. Not the best atmosphere in which to raise a kid, yes? Mom and dad get arrested, for various reasons, and Vanessa's parole officer shows up to take her back to foster care. Having none of that, she escapes, has one last long goodbye with her fiance (Bokeem Woodbine, just off his career-making role in Dead Presidents), and then sets out for Stockton, California, where her grandmother lives. Her car dies along the way, and youth counselor Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) stop to help; she accepts, but starts thinking after a while that Wolverton is actually the I-5 Killer, a serial murderer who's been preying on young hookers up and down the Southern California coast.
Don't worry, no spoilers there. We're still in the first half-hour of the movie. It gets better from there. (""Better"" in the loosest sense possible.)
Bright saves this movie from utter idiocy by playing it against itself. It's way too funny to have ever been meant as a serious drama, but you get the feeling that's how the script was originally conceived. Bright uses visual cues and scenes that approach utter silliness (Witherspoon walking into a diner covered in blood, sitting down, and ordering breakfast without realizing anything's amiss-one of the movie's funniest bits) while allowing the actors to do their things. He did assemble a fantastic cast for this, taking chances on the down-on-his-luck Sutherland and rising stars Woodbine, Witherspoon, and Weiss (whose small part in here is as chilling as they come), and adding such wonderful bit parts as an inept guy from the sheriff's office (the omnipresent Dan Hedaya), a bisexual nymphomaniac (Brittany Murphy, in her second big screen role), and a completely insane prison warden (Susan Barnes, whose performance here, like those she had in They Live and Repo Man, would alone make the film worth watching).
It's simultaneously brilliant and utterly stupid, especially when you realize how the interminable opening sequence ties in with the film-which, if Bright did his job correctly, you won't until the climax. It has all the earmarks of becoming a major underground cult film (""brilliant and utterly stupid"" in this quantity is rarely seen; Return of the Living Dead, Liquid Sky, Squirm, and Head all come to mind as other examples of this particular style of filmmaking). But for the life of me I can't figure out which wins out, so I'm stuck giving it a ***.
One other thing to note. This was billed as the ""special edition DVD."" If someone would please tell me what's so special about a DVD whose chapter selection doesn't even allow you to select every chapter and has the bare minimum of features to show even competency in releasing a DVD (in other words, buy the VHS tape if it's cheaper), I'd love to hear the explanation.

842920,4,630428666X,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time. I have to give credit to anyone who would agree to have anything to do with this movie, because there's some crazy stuff here. A very, very, twisted take on the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" story, featuring an illiterate prostitute as Red and a serial killer/rapist as the wolf. Aren't fariy tales fun?
Anyway, this modern adaptation of the story follows said prostitute Vanessa (portrayed excellently by Reese Witherspoon) on her way to her grandmother's house after her parents are both arrested. On the way, she meets child psychologist Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland), who she learns is in fact the notorious I-5 killer. After attempting to kill him, Vanessa is arrested and sent to prison, where she meets even more fun friends to share her adventure with, including a disfigured inmate played by Brittany Murphy, who gives a great performance as well. I don't want to give too much away (I've probably said too much already), but I can tell you that this is one funny movie, and if your sense of humor has a dark side, than this just might be for you.
I thought that one of the best things about this movie was Reese Witherspoon's performance, although I doubt that many ""Legally Blonde"" fans will like this movie much. She does a really great job with her role and is completely believable. The scene where she [possible spoiler here, so be warned] encounters Wolverton for the first time since the shooting is too funny and shows that she really was a great choice for the role. It's too bad that she doesn't do more films like this instead of Legally Blonde/Sweet Home Alabama/what ever other terrible movie she's working on next.
As for the rest of the actors, there's some other performances that are certaintly worth mentioning. Keifer Sutherland does a nice job as Wolverton, although I didn't think his performance was all that amazing. Brittany Murphy does a good job, as do the 2 guys (whoever they are) that play the cops. All performances are pretty good and I didn't feel that there was anyone here who did a bad job.
While the performances here are all at least decent, I think that the aspect of this film that really got it all the attention was the script. The dialog in this movie isn't the kind that you come across too often. You've got to be pretty brave to try making a movie like this, even in an industry as permissive as film. I can imagine that there was probably some feirce opposition to this movie at one time or another.
I will warn you that if you're even a bit sensitive, this movie may not be for you. This movie is a lot of things, but for the easily disgusted it's not. It's bound to offend lot's of viewers with the profanity, dark humor, violence, sexual content, and all the rest, but for those who can appreciate a little sick humor every now and then, I encourage you to give this movie a try, there's a good chance that you'll like it.",1056672000,22,2941,4.561436672967864

Although Kiefer Sutherland gets top billing and is great as the proto-90's serial killer that is intimate in the creepiest possible way to a teenager. Sutherland's nihilistic performance makes him real and not just a Jerry Springer generation cardboard character. The same is true of Reese Witherspoon who is really the star in this trailer trash meets girl power flick. Her range is exceptional, her facial expressions working vastly better than the script provided this film.
Although as some have mentioned there are several genres including dark comedy, road movie, post Pulp Fiction, etc. my take on it without knowing what the film was supposed to be about was to a degree commentary and parody.
The sad truth is one can imagine some of the seriously messed up people in the various scenes and locations. There are moments of Freeway that are serious as a heart attack that flip over to exploitation and into humor.
Fortunately the film works well enough to combine these disparate elements. The script is entertaining on a creepy level and elevated by it's actors. While the subjects covered range from disgusting (rape, torture, necrophelia) to absurd (the dream of grandma's trailer with giant giraffe dolls and other assorted strange objects) the film sometimes leaves the viewer inbetween emotions.
I liked this unbalanced approach, whether intentional or not. If anything I expected this film to be fluff because of Reese Witherspoon's involvement. Instead I came away admiring her acting talent.
The 'red ridinghood' storyline worked despite the film's opening credits. Many scenes were over the top which was also telegraphed by the first 10 minutes of the film. It was obviously a twisted look at twisted people.

They are both superb here in a script that is so well written that it had me gasping.  There is not one predictible moment in this script.  It is the freshest work I've seen in ages.

Witherspoon is about to be sent to foster care again when her prostitute mother is sent to jail. She runs away by taking to the LA Freeway where her car breaks down and she is ""rescued"" by Sutherland.  Witherspoon proceeds to prove herself as the most unconventional heroine in a way that wholly works.  Her nemesis is Sutherland.  Is she equal to the challenge of besting him?  You'll have to see it to find out.  (There is even a sly reference to Sutherland's being the Big Bad Wolf and Witherspoon a Red Riding Hood that puts the original to shame.)  Buy this one.  It is worth every penny.

843068,2,630428666X,"'Freeway' is a loud, hybrid film that is scuppered by its own hybridity.  It is never quite sure whether it wants to be a fairy tale, a rites-of-passage teen movie, a dark neo-noir thriller, a road movie, a black comedy, a white-trash cartoon a la John Waters, or a media satire.  Actually, it wants to be all these things, causing lopsidedness whenever any one element is privileged.
'Freeway' wants to be a blackly comic, violent cartoon, but also to sympathise with its put-upon heroine - the crude caricatures of the first make it difficult to do the second.  Kiefer Sutherland's turn from caring psychologist to slavering psychopath is well enough done, but completely devoid of tension, because the familiar fairy tale story ('Little Red Riding Hood') has been so broadly signalled, that a character called Wolverton can only be one thing.  This section relies on too much tedious conversation between the leads to provide back-story - this clunky device would have been more effective if we hadn't been forewarned about its inevitable outcome.
As the 'media satire' bit kicks in, there are a few lazy jokes to be had regarding Brooke Shields and a now deformed Sutherland (if you like laughing at the disabled), but the attempts to place Witherspoon in a feminist, girls-communal context are distinctly iffy in a film directed by a man who delights in putting his heroine through all sorts of hell.
The film, which is essentially a teen movie, bravely asserts the brutality of the police, the links between its aggession and a sex-killer's prurient curiosity, but eventually cops out (sorry) from this startling insight (startling, because movies rarely state it so bluntly).
'Freeway' is still a cut above most Hollywood fodder, with some wit among the noise, some invention among the flash, and an always interesting performance from an up-and-coming Reece Witherspoon.",1000339200,,1878,5.087662337662338

After a disturbing scene with her boyfriend (I don't want to spoil it for you), Vanessa runs away to live with her grandmother.
When her car breaks down on the freeway, Bob (Donald Sutherland) stops to lend her a hand, and offers to drive her to her grandmother's house. Posing as a sympathetic ear this devious serial killer gets Vanessa to reveal her innermost secrets and concerns to him.
Just when Bob is about to kill Vanessa she turns the tables on him. After a long conversation she convinces Bob to accept Jesus Christ into his heart as his personal Savior. The scene is touching and reveals that Vanessa, though troubled, is dedicated to bringing the message of Jesus to others in any way she can. Cinematically, it's a great shot.

What Matthew Bright has done here is phenomenal. He has taken a story we've all known since we were children and he has recast it in a world full of gang violence, drug dealers, prostitutes and pedophiles. The juxtaposition is brilliant; an innocent children's story perverted by the harshness of a reality that most of us rather forget.
But the coach can only line you up, he can't make the play for you. For that, Bright has enlisted the phenomenal talents of Reese Witherspoon, Kiefer Sutherland, Amanda Plummer, Brooke Shields, Dan Hedaya (in my opinion one of Hollywood's most underrated actors), Michael T. Weiss, Brittany Murphy, Wolfgang Bodison and Bokeem Woodbine and Alanna Ubach. I wouldn't mention so many cast members, except that they were all so well cast that it would have been a crime to leave one of them out.

Kiefer Sutherland is equally good, giving as greasy a performance as ever was of a smooth, unctuous predator.  Witherspoon is Cassandra-like; sure, she tries to execute Sutherland, shooting him in the neck and face, and twice in the back...but no one listens to her when she tells them he's the serial killer they're all looking for.  And she doesn't particularly care. Captured, accused, she lashes out at everyone.  She is prosecuted, while Sutherland is presented in the media as a victim.  Witherspoon taunts the now terribly-disfigured Sutherland hilariously in court--""Hey chipmunk-face!""--convincing everyone that she is an unpenitent sociopath.
Violence becomes Witherspoon's means of survival, and she isn't squeamish.  In jail, she fashions a makeshift ""knife"" by melting plastic wrap around a toothbrush, melting it, and then sharpening the plastic.  With this, she slashes a guard during an outing.  The guard cries, ""You didn't have to kill me!""
Vanessa snarls, ""I didn't!""  and off she goes.

Reese Witherspoon is very funny as Vanessa Lutz, a semi-literate teen who's got a whore for a mother and  a lecherous junkie for a stepfather.  By the way, Vanessa was faking that she couldn't read ""The cat drinks the milk"" in the opening scene just to make fun of the not entirely bright teacher.  She's a home girl who can kick Major Buttski along with any celluloid hero, doing here a nice variation of a Bridget Fonda-like La Femme Nikita.  She also has some admirable integrity and she's cute.
Kiefer Sutherland got way into his role as a child psychologist turned serial killer.  The satanic leers and psychopathic drooling on his face as he contemplates his necromantic encounter with Witherspoon was enough to curdle sweet cream.  Later when he gets the appliance to hold up half his mouth, displaying buck teeth, Witherspoon calls him a ""chipmunk,"" but I thought he looked  a little like Stephen Hawking after an injection of protoplasm.  And Brooke Shields as his grieving, empty-headed wife was a scream.  (And I did like that white skirt!)  We are talking creative casting here!
Director Matthew Bright takes dead satirical aim at shrinks, prison guards, cops, social workers, judges, teachers, and any other societal cogs he can find and lets Vanessa, representing the under class, choke 'em, gouge 'em, cuff 'em, shot 'em, out smart 'em, and slap 'em across the face.  One gets the impression that he was getting even with some people from his early years, which is good, since there's no revenge more satisfying than to trash your tormentors up there on the silver screen for all the world to see.

I wonder why I'm so resistant toward Reese Witherspoon.  I think it's probably because in every movie I've seen her in, she's forced to talk with a strained accent that makes fingernails on a chalkboard sound like a Beethoven symphony.  She's forced to act like such a resilient baby here I was hoping someone would stuff a sock in her mouth.  Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, fares really well as the child-molester-psychologist who picks her up (the ""big bad wolf""), and it's unfortunate that his scenes are limited.

843148,5,630428666X,"Why is ""Freeway"" one of the better films of the '90s? Here are  ONLY A FEW of the questions raised and terrains navigated successfully by  this hilarious, great little 'dark' film(its atrocious sequel ""Freeway  2,"" written and directed by the same guy (Mathew Bright), provides the  ULTIMATE PROOF just how thin the line between Greatness and Utter Manure  is, and how difficult it is to balance on that line):
Are speed taking  Prostitutes not good mothers? Well, obviously, they are not.  But, and this  is a big but, this does not necessarily constitute a situation where there  is no love between mother and child.  Damaged child? Well, to a certain  extent, of course, yes. But this does not rule out the possibility that  this damage can be transcended by a strong child such as Reese  Witherspoon's utterly convincing Vanessa.  This situation is the stuff of  American legend and heroism.  Huckleberry Finn is the classic example of  the damaged but still transcendently pure American soul overcoming a  disastrous background.  This is the soul that made the kid in ""Sling Blade""  so overwhelmingly sympathetic.  That soul is something precious--once it is  lost it can never be regained.  Huckleberry Finn kept it by running away.  The kid in Sling Blade was doomed because he was tied to his situation by  his love for his mother.  Consequently Billy Bob solved his problem for him  by sacrificing himself and getting rid of Dwight Yokam.  Overcoming  adversity and so-called damaged backgrounds is the very essence of a  certain authentic American heroism. Call it the `heroism of modern life' if  you want but there's no such thing as an anti-hero; that's as meaningless a  term as `amoral,'
There's a certain inherent integrity in youth that  under certain hardships, pressures and trials can flower into a beautiful  strength.  These kids instinctively arrive at a deeply ironic understanding  of things `sophisticated' people may take years to develop.  That  mysterious `strength' is the essence of Reese Witherspoon's  characterization of Vanessa Lutz. Vanessa  is the living embodiment of  writer/director Mathew Bright's cultivated irony in raw form.  Elizabeth  Berkeley's unfairly criticized performance in Verhoeven's ""Showgirls"" not  only operates within similar ""over the top"" territory but  demonstrates  similar qualities of  youthful `heroism,' and necessary ruthlessness.  ""Showgirls"" can be seen as the further misadventures of Vannesa, a few  years down the road, if she hadn't met up with Kiefer Sutherland's serial  killer.
""Freeway"" goes one better than breaking cliches, it shows and  exposes through ""over the top"" characters rooted firmly in reality certain  very fleeting characteristics vaguely noted and stored by most people.  Artists, who have cultivated powers of observation, are more familiar with  these fleeting characteristics on a conscious level;  they can detect and  observe them more freely in the regular, quite absurd but so-called ""not  over-the-top,"" ""everyday"" reality that we all live in.  In other words, in  `over-the-top' characters, those traces of absurdity you constantly discern  on a low volume level are turned way-up-high for easy exposure and  satirical comment. This is particularly necessary for  short-attention-spanned American audiences. Great directors may use  ultra-subtle methods to achieve the same results, but that requires  cultured audiences able to perceive that subtlety.  That subtlety usually  flies right over the heads of Americans.  A great, subtle foreign film  with dark satirical elements like Bruno Dumont's ""Life of Jesus"" or  ""L'Humanite"" will open, bore most Americans to death,  and close in a week.  So, in order to sell some tickets and say anything significant at all,  `over-the-top' performances and a so-called 'black'comedy format often  become necessary.  Masterpieces in this type of film though sometimes  instantly recognized (Dr. Strangelove), are quite often misinterpreted,  underrated, and later rediscovered (Sam Fuller's ""Shock Corridor"" and  ""Naked Kiss,"" Russ Meyer's ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"" Ken Russell's  ""Crimes of Passion"" and ""The Devils,"" Paul Verhoeven's ""Spetters"" and  ""Showgirls,"" etc.)
Bright's film shows no pity for vicious criminals and  sanctimonious citizens alike. Bright mocks all liberal tendencies of  showing ""compassion"" for vicious killers and also, of course, conservative  tendencies of passing judgment on a so-called `vicious' killer too  quickly.
After everything she's gone through Vanessa still manages to  smile triumphantly as she asks for a cigarette.  The two detectives showing  smiling admiration for her further solidifies her status as an exceptional  person and  `hero.'  The last shot freeze-frames on her slightly crazy  looking yet still non-cynical and non-bitter smile.",968630400,5,4839,5.533700137551582

Have you ever seen a film where the  crook never gets his just desserts, or if he did manage to pay for his  nasty deeds it was always towards the end of the movie and was done so  disappointingly!  Well this little Gem, pays homage to the Charles Bronson  and Dirty Harry school of A.. kicking!  The Scumbag Chipmunk (sorry for  insulting chipmunks! ) gets his face broken all over the place (YEAH! )  There are many laughable moments dotted all over this well told classic  fairytale! Definately not for kids, not that the original story was any  more suitable (violence wise! eating grandma etc! )
I don't wish to sound  like some demented LYNCH'IM type, but I must confess that the more  civilised part of my brain gets mixed up, when Real Scumbags get a slap on  the wrist, while the victims ends up tormented for the rest of their lives.  That was why, I sooo enjoyed this movie (My primative side found  release! ) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",957830400,7,1628,4.631578947368421

843152,4,630428666X,"This wickedly perverse black comedy features a stellar performance by Reese Witherspoon, this girl can really act. Exploitative and excessively violent, it is also extremely entertaining and deffinitely not for the  squeamish. Kiefer Sutherland also gives a noteworthy performance as the  sick killer. Overlong and overdone in places but worthwhile because of  Whiterspoon's performance, which ultimately walks away with the movie. From  a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 7!",956707200,,476,5.569444444444445
843153,4,630428666X,This is what indie movies should be like.  This movie is very edgy with some great directing.  Reese Witherspoon dose a great job and nobody will look at her the same way again after her great performance.  Kiefer  Sutherland makes a lasting impression without an overkill in screen time  and the story is exellent but very screwed up.  A definate buy for anybody  that enjoys a good quality moive that dose not depend on speicial effects.,954288000,,439,4.697368421052632
843154,5,630428666X,"Let me say up front, that I'm a fan of Reese Witherspoon. She's done a good job in a number of diverse roles from ""Fear"" to ""Election"". I personally think this is her best performance.  Freeway is not a movie for everyone, the subject matter is quite  confronting, and the violence is pretty graphic. However, the movie is  first and foremost a dark comedy, and it's very funny! The scene in the  courtroom with Reese and Keifer had me rolling on the floor. I've shown  this movie to a number of friends, and without exception, they've all  enjoyed the film. The sound and image quality are both excellent, which  adds to the overall value of the DVD. To sum up, if you enjoy dark  comedies, fine acting, and are not terribly sqeamish, then  ""Freeway"" may be just the ticket for your next movie night.",953510400,4,801,4.506944444444445

843210,1,630428666X,"I can not believe this movie.  This is a very explicit movie with very harsh sexual language.  I love Reese Witherspoon and she acted her part very well, but it does not make up for the horrible content.  This movie  took a little girl and turned her into something horrible.  Not even half  way through the movie I had to turn it off.  I would not recommend this to  anyone to watch or waste their money on renting it.",949363200,8,419,4.215189873417722
843211,1,630428666X,"I saw this movie for the first time on TV.  I always have to know the ending of any movie, so of course I sat through the entire duration of Freeway.  Reese Witherspoon was amazing, but the movie's plot left a lot to  be desired.  This movie is jam packed with graphic violence, an extreme  amount of sex talk, and depicts women as pieces of meat.  I'm not a  conseravtive movie watcher, but come on, did they really have to show  Vanessa's grandmother strangled and naked on the floor?  I think this could  have been a great movie if the writers/producers/directors showed a little  bit of taste.

843212,1,630428666X,"I realize I'm swimming against the tide here, as most of the other reviews for this film have been positive.  All I can tell you is that I found this movie to be ugly and depressing and to have no humanity.  Reese Witherspoon  is one of best actresses to emerge from Hollywood in the last several years  -- she was great in ""Pleasantville"" and downright brilliant in  ""Election.""  I have to wonder why she agreed to make this film --  her performance is daring, but it deserves to be in a much better film than  this.  It's not surprising that this movie was produced by Oliver Stone --  like all of his films, it celebrates violence, vulgarity and the  degradation of women.",948240000,8,675,4.450819672131147

Grab some popcorn, and curl up on the couch as Reese  Witherspoon wraps you up in a modern, much more grown-up remake of the  classic, ""Little Red Ridding Hood."" ...Wait!!
