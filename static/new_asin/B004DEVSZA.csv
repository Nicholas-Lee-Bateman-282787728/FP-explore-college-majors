8425246,4,B004DEVSZA,"I really enjoyed the movie Wheel of Knowing.  The members of the family were well-cast.  It had a good contrast between faith in action and ""faith in action"", one real and one not.  My only disappointment in the movie was when the mom's father was missing and her new friend challenged her to not lose faith and pray.  I really didn't see the mom pray, wished she had. It would have showed her faith more clearly.",1330732800,,413,4.394736842105263
8425247,1,B004DEVSZA,"I am sorry this movie is a poor excuse for a Christian Movie. Our family has experienced the same situation, so I know first hand the trials of having a parent with dementia. The thing that bothered me the most, is that there does not appear to be a true Christian in the whole movie. This movie makes Christians look like hypocrites and phonies. I found this very upsetting and not God glorifying at all.",1324339200,,405,4.413333333333333
8425248,5,B004DEVSZA,"As I watched it I could relate in so many ways.  I am challenged and encouraged in my faith.  It involved real life scenarios that we face.  It showed how Christians can waver in faith, but come out in the fire of hard times, because God will see us through.

8425249,5,B004DEVSZA,I understood the angst that this family was experiencing. Having been a caregiver for over 20 years and a Christian I know the inner battles of caring for a loved one. Especially a family member where a strained relationship exists. This film showed the raw emotions caregivers and their families experience and yet it was a true story of hope. Knowing that our Father God never forsakes us and that He is the only constant we can depend on during these trying times. This is a portrayal of a true journey of love.,1303689600,,514,4.537634408602151
8425250,4,B004DEVSZA,"WHEEL OF KNOWING should be of interest to anyone who cares about people.  The pressure of being a caregiver is overwhelming.  Many are now facing the care of aging parents (relatives); this film hits the issue directly.  WHEEL OF KNOWING is realistic, and therefore, places before the viewer the dilemma of  time spent with children and spouse vs. time spent with elderly parents/relatives.  Gather the family and watch it together.",1302307200,,432,5.114285714285714
8425251,5,B004DEVSZA,"Wheel of Knowing is a story which centers around one family of Christian believers going through an almost unbearable crisis.  The story has many elements to it.  However, what I gleaned most in the message of the film is that, Christians go through the same experiences that non-Christian people do. They have ups and downs and sometimes things get just downright horrible! Yet, if they stand in faith, they do not have to succumb to the circumstances in the same manner a person who doesn't have faith does.  Like biblical characters, apart from God, there are no perfect characters expressed here.  Every personality is uniquely human and flawed. Yet Wheel of Knowing demonstrates how God will gladly intervene when He is sought and things are turned over to Him.",1297296000,5,766,4.9147286821705425
