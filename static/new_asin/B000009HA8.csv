7905481,3,B000009HA8,"HANDSOME SIBLINGS (1992) is a lightweight but charming kung fu parody about the budding attraction between two young martial artists, a male and a female, who've been raised by opposing clans to contend for control of the martial arts world. With direction by comedy star Eric Tsang, the emphasis here is on romance and comedy rather than fighting, although there are plenty of graceful ""flying fu"" scenes in which the characters leap high and flail about amidst swirling fabrics and twirling swords. The leads are played by two high voltage Hong Kong stars---pop idol Andy Lau (MOON WARRIORS) and costume diva Brigitte Lin (BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR), with a strong supporting cast led by Cheung Man, Ng Man Tat, Richard Ng and, in full flamboyant villain mode, Francis Ng. Fans of Ms. Lin should check her out first in such other high-flying swordplay fantasies of the early '90s as SWORDSMAN II, THE EAST IS RED, DRAGON INN and SEMI-GODS AND SEMI-DEVILS.",989798400,,953,4.925465838509317
