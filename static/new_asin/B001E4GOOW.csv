8624059,5,B001E4GOOW,"I LOVE this DVD set !!! Yitzhak Navon is charming, friendly, knowledgeable and just plain entertaining in this three-disc set, which covers the ""basics"" of Sephardic life on the Iberian Peninsula before, during and since the dark days of the Spanish Inquisition.

If you are at all interested in Sephardic history, get this set. You won't be disappointed.

I do have one caution for viewers; there is nudity on the first and third discs (topless women), so beware if you are offended, and/or watching with children. Otherwise, ENJOY !!",1306713600,2,535,5.0
