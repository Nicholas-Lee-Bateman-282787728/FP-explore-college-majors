1400633,3,B000056MMR,"Shots of a N.Y. tugboat spraying water into the air, pictures of people crowding N.Y. streets. These are the scenes that act as a filler in the New York City Ballet's workout video and DVD.  In between all the ballet hype about the ballet stars' busy lives, we are given some basic Pilates moves and some quick ballet stretches and jumps. I agree with another reviewer that there are NOT enough repetitions to do much to work the body. Everything is done to quickly, as if you are caught up in the hectic pace of New York City. Having taken adult ballet classes with the Houston Ballet for 5 years, I was let down by this video. While I think that New York City Ballet is one of the best in the world, their video is a rip-off.  Instead, spend your money on the Kultur video called, ""The Ballet Workout"" with Melissa Lowe.  It is a much better investment.",991699200,,855,4.364779874213837
1400634,3,B000056MMR,"This video workout is a lot of fun, and a lot of laughs if you have never taken ballet before. I really like doing it, however, I do not think that it is that hard of a workout. At the end of it, I am not even remotely tired or sore, but maybe that is because I am used to doing Tae-Bo every day. However, it is very relaxing and the music to the workouts is very calming. It definitely brings me down from a hard day at school, but as for it toning my body, that is yet to be seen (or felt). I guess I am the kind of person who needs to feel the pain in order to feel like I am doing anything worthwhile for my body.",988675200,3,617,3.717557251908397
1400635,3,B000056MMR,"I was looking for a routine which would give me something to do on the alternate days from my step aerobics routine. It is a nice DVD to do when you need to de-stress and do something good for yourself at the same time. I did find however that the cueing leaves much to be desired. Quite often you are forced to be looking at the screen instead of concentrating on proper movement as the cueing lacks precision. At one point at the floor barre section, the dancer changes legs and unless you are watching, you are totally clueless. This forces you to torque your neck and quite often strains your shoulders. Hopefully, I will memorize this section soon. Another problem, is that you are not sure if you are ""done"" once the DVD is finished. Should you go back and do the ""warm up"" section again to ""cool down"" ? Who knows.  I do enjoy this workout, but would have preferred the cues be given more consistenly and from the users point of view instead of the dancers point of view. ie: your right foot moving is not the foot that is on the right side of your screen, but rather the dancers right foot, which is on the left side of the screen.",988416000,13,1139,4.297674418604651
1400636,4,B000056MMR,"Some of the reviewers are saying this is too hard to follow. I disagree. I have never studied ballet in my life and I found this very simple to follow. The exercises are broken down by name (DVD) so its easy to learn what the fancy names mean. The moves are clearly shown and are very easy to follow. Proper form takes a while, but I am starting to notice how my body is moving and how it should be moving compared to the dancers on my TV. And I am noticing results already. I only wish the there were MORE excercises on the DVD because I love it so much, even though there is about an hour already. ...The cinematography is gorgeous, and the dancers are amazing.
The DVD version is amazing. I love the interviews, diaries and behind the scenes footage. For someone who studies ballet or wants to dance professionally, this is is a must have over the VHS version.
The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the 2nd and 3rd warm up sections are like intermediate or advanced ballet dance routines. I try to follow as best I can for someone who never took ballet. But, its just the warm-up so it does not ruin the workout at all. And the hype about Sarah Jessica Parker is aweful. She talks for just over a minute and it does not have anything to do with the workout at all. I was hoping for a bit more with her on the DVD.
But I do LOVE this workout!",986342400,,1364,4.131578947368421
1400637,4,B000056MMR,"This was a good workout.  I have never taken ballet before and was able to follow along (a bit clumsily the first time, but better the next time).  The warm up is some dance moves that you just need to try to follow, but after that it was easier to follow along. There is not alot of explaination of how to do the moves.  I read the brochure that came with it and got some tips from that, such as focusing on all of your muscles while doing the moves. I also had read in an article to keep all of your muscles contracted to work all of your body. I felt this would be a good addition to my current workouts which include yoga, weight training and aerobics.  The music was enjoyable and relaxing and you work your muscles differently than in typical exercises.  As with yoga, it will also enhance your balance, posture, muscle tone and mental focus.  On the DVD, the verbal cueing seemed a bit off at times, but I was able to follow along by watching the dancers.  The exercises are broken down on the DVD so you can pick and choose which you want to do.  The exercises are numbered and the last set displayed out of order on my screen, but now I have it figured out despite that.  I have already noticed some toning in my thighs and strengthening in my back.  Overall I felt this was a pretty good workout.  It may not be for someone who is looking for a more aerobic workout.  But if you are tired of doing typical excersises and want variety in your workout you will enjoy this.",986256000,8,1480,4.209219858156028

1400668,5,B000056MMR,"This DVD with accompanying booklet inspires me to exercise while enjoying the lovely music. The workouts can be adjusted to fit your interest, say skiing. The dancers are amazing but I'm not intimidated and I'm a grandma. Flexibility  is an issue for me and this group of exercises is very helpful. I like the pace of DVD and that it can be paused if I need to do so. This DVD is not to hip-hop music but to some of my favorite pieces of classical music. The DVD also features alternative music to the ballet pieces. This purchase was one of my best on Amazon.",1457049600,6,560,4.333333333333333

The dancers' bodies are inspiring and the workouts, while a little tough at times, are accessible for just about anyone.  They are easily modified, and even I, a complete klutz who dropped out of ballet as a child because I was stumbling over my own feet, can do them.  There is a good mix of floor workouts and of standing workouts.  Also, the classical music is pleasant and soothing, and will make you feel graceful, and the narrator has a nice, quiet voice.  I would highly recommend this DVD to be added to your collection.",1441670400,3,607,4.383928571428571

1400700,4,B000056MMR,This DVD is a little hard to follow if you have never taken ballet and you do not know what the positions are.  I also found the person's voice giving instructions very creepy.  Besides that I did find the DVD to give a very good workout.,1413849600,,238,4.1521739130434785

1400702,3,B000056MMR,"This is a nice workout, reminiscent of a ballet class with a little more conditioning.  It's a moderate-intensity 60-minute workout.  However, the cues for the next step are oddly timed and not very descriptive; you need to keep an eye on the dancers to understand what's going on, even if you're supposed to be lying on your stomach.  But, in a few workouts, you get used to it and remember the sequences.

What makes this a 3-star review is the DVD itself being too restrictive.  The first 3-1/2 minutes of your workout, you are forced to just stand there and watch an introduction / credit sequence that you can't skip.  And, if you thought you could do the 60-minute workout in two 30-minute sessions, good luck; you can't skip chapters.  I used to have this video on VHS, and I really wish I had stuck with that.",1406246400,,817,4.517006802721088

This has been my go-to workout for the past 10 years, on and off.  Before purchasing this copy, I hadn't done it in a couple of years, but due to weather (HOT!), age (over 50 now) and stress, this seemed like just the thing.  I love the music (you have a choice between classical and contemporary) and the workout itself is relaxing....how can that be when it works so well?  Improve your flexibility, strength, muscle tone and endurance and enjoy the wonderful music at the same time--de-stress!! Other videos have fast, pumping canned music and leave you feeling worn out, but not NYC Ballet.

I say started because my copy became so scratched up that I had to stop using it. The exercises do require concentration and correct postures which can be difficult at first, but persevere and you will get the lean body you want.",1363219200,,407,4.1923076923076925
1400723,4,B000056MMR,"I really do like this DVD very much. It was a wonderful introduction for an older (over 50) beginner like me into learning some very basic ballet moves and it was perfect for a home practice. I like how the sections are broken up into do-able sections or you can play it all at once. The one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that the music sometimes drowns out the soft voice of the instructor. Very annoying. Otherwise I do enjoy this workout, its challenging and I can already see and feel the benefits of working out with it even though I  have never had a ballet class.",1363046400,3,595,4.219298245614035
1400724,3,B000056MMR,"First, I am not a trained dancer.  However, this dvd seems like what a ""warm-up"" for a ballet work-out would be.  I kept waiting for it to really begin and it never did:(  It was close to an hour and the only work I felt was during the 10 pushups and 10 crunches.  Needless to say, the dvd is beautifully produced, and worth watching.  However, you will outgrow it very quickly if you're using it as a work-out.  I enjoyed the music, despite the fact that I never listen to classical music.  The gripes that people have with the cool-down having no narration can be easily remedied by watching it once before you do it.  Outside of the cool-down, the rest of the dvd is easy to follow because of the music and you feel the change in movements about to come; though there is no explanation of how to do the movements.  (If you really want to know prior to viewing, just look at a book or quick video online of - first position, fifth position, tendu, plie, battement, coupe, attitude and arabesque).  There is a 5 minute section on ""Dance in the City"" on the dvd.  It's a really cool piece to watch.

I recommend this dvd if you are a beginner, but you may need to use a high chair for a couple of parts if you have any balance issues.  Again, you will outgrow it fairly quickly though.  If you are beyond beginner, I recommend it only if you are using it prior to a cardio workout because there is an element of stretch in there.  But who has an extra hour for that???  Borrow it from someone to watch and do it once.  You will see what I mean by my review.  I will check out volume 2 and review that next :)",1362096000,,1608,4.165584415584416
1400725,4,B000056MMR,"Wonderful adaptation of traditional ballet workout for anyone.  Especially those like myself who have never taken a dance class, but still want a workout to create lean tone muscles.",1357776000,,182,5.275862068965517
1400726,4,B000056MMR,wanted to save money by doing classes at home. I guess leotards and tights are pass? have not taken classes in years.,1355356800,,117,4.363636363636363
1400737,2,B000056MMR,"I'm not a dancer and have no dance background, but picked this DVD up at the library in hopes that it would be useful in helping me develop better flexibility and leaner muscles that dancers have as I tend to bulk up when doing strength exercises.

However, I stopped the workout after barely finishing the warm ups as it was just...so....slow. I've done yoga and pilates before where the movements compensate for the slow pace of the workout, but this ""workout"" was pretty pointless and I felt I was just skipping in place while waving my arms in the air.

The Good
*Narrator names the ballet moves. It's always nice to know the name of a movement as it forces your brain to recognize and remember the sequence.
*Dancers are fit but not fragile, bone-breakable thin that it's hard to take the workout seriously.
*Background music is pleasant, though rather over loud at times to the point of almost drowning out the narrator's voice.
*Actual dance movements are not hard to do if you can figure out the step sequences.

The Terrible
*Cheesy Sarah Jessica Parker intro that was unnecessary and provides no benefit to the workout. Actually the entire intro was pointless and a waste of 5+ minutes. It's just a montage of ballet movements that is really meaningless for someone who wants to workout.
*Workout was not slow in order to help a person pick up the movements, it was slow for movie mood and effect. There's no followable pace; it's randomly slow, quick, fast, back to slow in no apparent order or purpose and you're not provided cues to know when to switch your pace.
*There's no lead dancer/trainer. The whole thing is narrated by a soft spoken man who sounds like he is narrating a nature special that requires whispering.
*Warm up combinations are very hard to do correctly if you have no dance background. The moves are basic enough that a non-dancer could potentially figure out how they're supposed to move, but the problem is that the pace is very erratic, thus by the time a non-dancer has coordinated arms and leg movements, the warm up is already over.
*Dancers are on a shadowy, grey-black background which makes seeing the movements difficult at times. I'm working out my body not trying to strain my eyes.
*Some movements are not explained at all. In one warm up move, the male dancers lunge backwards into a runners stance and hold the calf muscle stretch. This is how the narrator refers to it: ""Now stretch your calf"". There's no walkthrough of the movement, the dancers literally just get into the position with no warning and the narrator adds his worthless comment.

Obviously this movie (as it's not a workout) was put together for no other purpose than to make a quick dollar as there seems to be a lot of artistic, but little practical thought put into it. Maybe useful or entertaining to some dancers but is of little use to us plebeian exercisers. If I want to be entertained by a movie about ballet, I'll watch Center Stage.",1341964800,4,2958,4.671785028790787
1400738,4,B000056MMR,"This is a great work out for stretching and flexibility. If you had minimal exporsure to formal modern jazz or ballet classes ,it is useful. With no exposure to dance classes,it may be too much too soon. My one complaint is the dvd itself, it only plays in my lap top.",1341446400,,268,4.2745098039215685
1400739,4,B000056MMR,"The 1-star reviews clearly are for Disc 1, which gives no instruction in proper form and frankly, one of the women (the square, unshapely one) has only passable form, it hurts me to watch her (the two men and the other woman are excellent, however). The second DVD is fantastic. It's all about strengthening core muscles and stretching in a graceful way and would be a great thing to do after a Gyrotonics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GYROKINESIS-R-DVD-Level-I-Format-1/dp/B000E3WHJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GYROKINESIS(R) DVD, Level I Format 1</a>&nbsp;warm-up.

The people complaining that it's without a barre don't realize they SHOULD learn to use the muscles that makes these possible without a barre, and ANYONE can do them without one -- in fact if you start without a barre then you probably won't develop bad habits with these core muscles. That said, go easy at first, staying within your level of flexibility. So what if you lost your balance a bit at first, you'll learn how to stretch up from your pelvis and use your leg muscles instead of leaning.  And don't use this DVD without also having some private sessions with a professional, to get feedback. I think pilates would be a good thing to do as well, along with using this DVD.",1340928000,,1295,5.281553398058253
1400740,3,B000056MMR,"I have about a year and a half of ballet experience - this is a semester of Ballet 101 in college and about 9 months of ballet lessons as an adult.  My last instructor let me come as a beginner adult to the advance class to dance with the teenagers with the warning it would not be simplified, I'd just have to do what I can do.  We recently moved away, and I have not found a suitable place to continue lessons.  I had this DVD, but had never tried it, so I decided to go for it.  So for me the ballet terminology was not a problem, and although the narration is spotty, I could follow, but I feel there are a few things holding it back.  The stretch and floor barre routines are excellent, and I felt I made progress with my body awareness through them.  The second half of the video however is uninspiring.  I'm not sure why they decided to do basic barre exercises without a barre.  My feeling was if you had the skill/balance to execute them correctly without the barre, then you probably would not find them all that challenging.  Ballet has the barre for a reason, so I don't get that choice.  I also did not feel warmed up enough for the jetes (little jumps) at the end.  In real class we did changements near the end, which are similarly exhausting, but this is after center work where we've gone through several other heart raising activities.  I actually think changements are easier that jumping in place like that.  It's better than nothing, but I think if you've experienced a real challenging barre routine, you are going to find this wanting like I did.  I think I'll use the stretch and floor barre sections, but try another video for a good barre routine.",1339459200,,1673,4.372168284789644

My purpose of buying this video was to find exercices dancers do to work/muscle their legs (especially). And I have found what I wanted.
I will probably write down the exercises and do my own warm up and work out selection everyday.
Indeed, the full workout is long to do everyday. Another true comment was that you shall not ""loose"" your time trying to execute the combinations if you are a ballet student starter (as I am). I felt frustrated already just looking at the combos at first time :-/
I will probably buy the book as comments say it is even better than the video!

1400743,3,B000056MMR,"I took ballet class about 15 years ago, but I was never really serious.  I remember plies and the foot positions and not much else.  I've gone through some parts of the dvd twice, and I am by far not the most coordinated of people.  The narrator is not the greatest as he describes how to do things for the first few times and then does not keep reinforcing when to switch legs, perform a different move.  The ballet dancers in the video seem to know when to switch, so it's a test of your body-eye coordination.  Overall, watching the dvd, things look kind of slow, but when I actually do it, I feel as if the moves are a little too fast and I actually do start sweating a bit.  It's definitely low impact, but I have a feeling it works pretty well as a workout.

I would say that this is an okay dvd, but especially if you are not fast at picking things up and do not have a real background in ballet (as in knowing tendu, portabras, passe, releve, and your foot positions), it will be difficult and frustrating at first.  Of course, if you are determined, a few tries will get you into things.  It's nice to see how these ballet dancers can bend their legs over their heads and such.  Makes me a little jealous.",1313539200,3,1214,4.216450216450217

1400757,3,B000056MMR,"Overall I like this dvd.  However, for some reason the director did not have the narrator instruct each move when on the floor. The dancers will transition without the narrator informing you that they are switching legs or even switching moves!  So, you end up compromising your form to stare at the television to make sure you don't miss moves.  Also, sometimes the moves are done by a woman and they switch to a man in the middle..so unless you are watching from start to finish, you might think you missed something.  And the cooldown is the worst. The narrator stops completely to let you follow the dancers, however part of the time you are to be looking down at the floor or up at the ceiling--so how is one to know when to transition to the next move when you are not to be looking at the television?  I think the director failed on what could be a really great and different style of workout. Clearly they didn't run this by a newbie to ask for input.  If you are committed, you can eventually figure out what to do, but it will take mulitple times of just watching it and learning as you go.  Also, this is not a cardio workout, so if you are looking for that, look elsewhere.",1298505600,3,1185,4.334841628959276

I had to stop and rewind the dvd quite a few times, to make sure I had picked up on things correctly.
Overall, it was still pretty good.

I find that it is helping my posture, keeping the gut in, strengthening my body & it seems to be healing a bum knee. Even if you never do the actual dances, the warm ups & exercises are ideal. It can greatly prevent falling & breaking your hip when you become elderly. Those of us who did not train when we were younger can have these tapes for decades because you never get to the point where you are too good & advanced for the tapes.

I would highly reccomend this workout!",1261094400,3,342,4.913793103448276
1400765,2,B000056MMR,"As a swing dancer I wanted to try to expand my repertoire a bit while working on developing my core muscles. This ballet workout seemed to be a great idea to introduce me to that world and attacking my strength from a different perspective.

However, while the exercises themselves are interesting, different, and are in fact working different muscles than I'm used to, the DVD itself is extremely problematic.

The organization of the DVD is erratic. The ""Sections"" seem to move in random order, and even though they are numbered 1-17, they are not organized in that manner even within the menu items. For instance, the menu for sections 13-17 are ordered in the sequence (from top-down, left to right, the way most English speakers read): 15, 17, 16, 13, 14. Attempting to run the sections in order fails miserably, as there is apparently some randomizing element (e.g., the last time I did this it took me from Section 2 ""Warm Up 2"") direction to Section 7 (""Floor Barre 2""), skipping two more warmup and stretching sections). As noted elsewhere, you simply cannot fast-forward or rewind to the next section, but rather have to exit to the menu and then return (supposing you don't have the patience for rewinding 2+ minutes of exercises to the beginning).

The menus themselves are problematic at best. Often times selecting ""Menu"" changes to a sub-menu, and it becomes a crapshoot as to whether or not you wind up at the place you are expecting. For instance, moving into the sub-menu ""features"" brings up sections for interviews, ""sports ballet"", and a couple of other items. After trying 3 different DVD players I've verified that it's not working as one might intuit. Sometimes I've exited an exercise to find myself at the interview sub-menu. Trying to click on ""menu"" in the interview sub-menu just refreshes the menu *or* brings me back to the Features menu, but clicking on the only ""menu"" option on *that* screen returns me back to the Interviews submenu! The Sports Options submenu (with Football, Skiing, and Racquet Sports) simply doesn't work at all and merely brings me consistently back to the Features sub-menu.

As noted elsewhere, the narration is quite poor. While the tone and tenor of Peter Martins' voice is soothing and even, it is often late with instruction (e.g., dancers have already begun the move on screen by the time he directs the viewer), incorrect (e.g., he describes working the left side when the dancer is working the right), or missing altogether (e.g., some exercises require you to be face-down and unable to see the screen, and thus unaware of what the exercise is that you are doing because there is no accompanying narration). This can get quite frustrating when you remember that the DVD will not let you navigate back to the beginning of the exercise to see what you missed!

Additionally, for someone who comes from a different style of dancing with its own terminology, the lack of definitions of terms was problematic. Some terms, such as pli, are defined only in their own section (in this case, it's the ninth!), long after they are introduced in the warmup. There is no instruction on how to do them properly, nor what each exercise is designed to do. I was fortunate that my girlfriend did ballet for many years and was able to translate for me and show me what each movement was and term meant.

Now, having said all that (and the frustration with the DVD itself is huge), the exercises *are* good. There is no question that they're demonstrated in proper form (and with incredible precision, as one would expect), and even the most dedicated dancer can aspire to the strength, flexibility, and grace demonstrated. Truthfully, if you're not breathing heavier after doing this, you're not focusing on the form properly.

The video itself is beautiful, soft lighting (though it does tend to interfere at times with seeing the actual forms, but only in a minor way). The music is, well, ""meh,"" doesn't do much to add or subtract to the exercise (though some of the contemporary options are more likely to put me to sleep rather than motivate me to work harder).

My recommendation: If you already know the movements and are looking to improve form, flexibility and already have a workout that you use, this is a passable third or fourth-string backup. The DVD navigation issues will likely hold you back from daily use (because, after all, becoming motivated to work out is hard enough without having to add in the mental preparation necessary to fight with the menus). Finding this in a $10-or-less bargain bin is the best option, but anything more than that would be unwise.",1258070400,2,4630,4.829760403530895

1400787,5,B000056MMR,"Ballet improves your posture and gives you a sense of grace even when you are not working out. The New York City Ballet workout presents exercises in a formal ballet style setting. For minutes at a time you forget you are not a ballerina as you work through the warm-up with first and second position.

Fluid movements follow as you move from side to side and then put a spring in your step. A floor routine follows with leg stretches and then you work your abs in every possible way, although each movement is so precise you are getting double the workout in half the time.

The unique and challenging postures and dance steps are explained as you are doing them, although at times the choreography takes center stage as the narration lessens and you focus more on the dancers instead of following the cueing.

This is a well structured, intermediate to advanced workout that requires a sense of determination, some experience with Pilates and possibly Yoga. The jumps are the most challenging and the entire workout fine tunes your balance. There are 17 exercise sessions and bonus programs including video diaries, behind the scenes footage and interviews.

Back exercises appear during the floor workout, but you are using your entire body at all times because most of the workout requires you to be super focused and keep your balance so you may feel this the most in your back after the workout. Throughout the exercises classical music guides you into a peaceful space where you feel relaxed even though you are working out at a fairly high level that requires patience and endurance.

1400788,2,B000056MMR,"I have taken several basic ballet classes and was expecting more from this video based on the other reviews.  Even with a basic background, I was quickly lost during the initial warmup.  The directions for each exercise (and cues for switching sides/to a new position) are minimal and are nonexistant in the intial warmup.  How to do each stretch/position is NOT explained, neither before the pose nor during it.

Each position is only run through a few times - just enough to start getting the feel of it/seeing how to do it properly.  In order to actually get a workout (or any benefit) from each position, one would need to ""rewind"" the DVD and repeat each section a few times.  I didn't feel like I got any sort of real stretching, cardiovascular, or muscle toning workout - even though the video is approximately 1 hour.

I have not tried other ballet videos, but if you are looking to get a cardiovascular workout or any sort of toning, I would suggest trying something different.  If you just want to briefly learn each position (without any real instruction as to body alignment/positioning), and are willing to continue each pose for more time than is alloted in each segment, this is a good video for you.

It's very relaxing but at the same time gets your heart rate up, and I can definitely feel it working my muscles.

Non-dancers shouldn't be intimidated by this workout.  Although you might feel a little awkward at first, as long as you are willing to keep trying (and laugh at yourself occasionally) it will really be worth it.

Otherwise its a fun workout. I enjoy how beautifully its shot, and the classical music helps get you in the right space. It lacks standing barre movements, (I don't know what this floor barre is) and the instructor just drops out sometimes while the movements have changed and you have no idea.

I TOTALLY Agree and seeing as my husband did this with me the first time (and there is also a sports option to help strengthen him for skiing!) I don't understand where people are saying they had a hard time following it... Maybe they couldn't keep up, but...any aerobics class, yoga class or pilates class i've ever been to - the instructor usually say the same thing just do as much as you can and just as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit and once you do it a couple of time you will get the hang of it! that's what practice is for - no one is perfect typically the first time!",1168387200,5,1739,4.266666666666667

Yes, most of the cueing is pretty bad, especially at the end; the ""Reverence"", which is a shame, for it's a very nice series of moves.  I plan on watching it many times so I get it right.

If you're insecure about your level of flexibility or the shape of your body, I don't recommend this dvd!  The dancers are in extraordinary shape (of course!)

1400809,4,B000056MMR,"The New York City Ballet Workout has more in common with a film playing at your local art house theatre than the average workout DVD.  It is artistically masterful--a work of art in light and shadow and movement of the human body.  But is it a good workout?

Once you get past the fact that this workout is filmed and formatted like a movie, and the fact that its artfulness sometimes means the workouts are a little dark, you are ready to enjoy a sublimely serene workout that combines real ballet moves with some Pilates moves.  While the menu doesn't offer you the option to build a custom workout from its various parts (a real shame), you do have the option of either performing the entire workout (just over an hour) or picking and choosing from sections of the workout when you have less time.

The workout, which is narrated by Peter Martins, Director of the New York City Ballet Company, is done to light classical music and performed by two male and two female dancers who are part of the NYC Ballet Company.  It includes:

Sections 1-4:  Three standing warm-up segments (#2 is my favorite) and one stretching segment on the floor prepare your body for the workout.

Sections 5-8:  One segment of abs and three segments of Floor Barre for toning the legs, back, abs and buns.  This section will be somewhat familiar to fans of Pilates.

Sections 9-12:  Plis, Tendu, Degag, Pass

Sections 13-17:  Arabesque Raises, Reverence, Grand Battement Front, Front Attitude, Little Jumps (There is no segment called ""Cool down"" but the narration indicates that Reverence is what ballet dancers use to cool down, so that is what I used.)

You need no previous ballet training to do this workout.  I had none, but had previously used another ballet workout that gave me a ""leg up"" in doing this workout.  If you are discouraged by seeing people who are in peak physical condition---whose bodies can do things yours probably can't---this may not be the workout for you.  It's necessary to go into this realizing that you probably will never be able to match these dancers in terms of flexibility.  That doesn't mean the workout is undoable for a non-dancer---they have simplified the movements to make them doable for ""real people"" (but they still offer a challenge).

If your goal is a tighter toned body, I recommend this workout.  It requires some patience, but I think for anyone who dreamed of being a ballerina as a child, and definitely for anyone who took ballet lessons, it will be most worth it.  Beyond the body benefits of the workout, I found it also relaxing and uplifting to the spirit.  Finally, the pleasure of watching beautiful bodies in motion cannot be discounted.",1160006400,22,2681,4.740820734341253

However, after about two weeks of doing the workout three times of week, my balance and flexibility were beginning to improve, and my legs became more familiar with the positions.

This workout is good if you are burned out on the gym scene. I have found that doing the ballet workout before cardio such as running enables me to run farther.

If you are ready for taking it to the next level, I would advise ballet workout two, but you should definitely buy both of them together for the discounted price!",1157068800,16,746,4.398550724637682

In just one week I noticed a great improvment in my strength, flexibility, and overall energy level. The relaxing music and easy pace make the workout a perfect stress reliever. And it's fun to do as well! I highly recommend The New York City Ballet Workout.",1154217600,4,462,4.646341463414634
1400812,4,B000056MMR,"I watched the trailer on [...] and it looked like it was perfect for me.

I am tired of my videos with perky instructors telling me I can do it and all of the glitz.  I wanted something lower key.  I have the firm series 1-2-3 and I think they are great but I was looking for a change because I was a little burned out with that kind of workout.  Also, I find working with weights boring.

I have never done ballet and I couldn't tell you what position 1 or 3 is.  There are some reviewers who were upset about that.  I don't know what the big deal is.  I just looked at the dancers and did what they did.  I don't have to know what it is called to do it I can easily figure it out by watching.

I loved the music!  I don't listen to that kind of music but I loved it here.  It made me relax and think about what I was doing--calmly--instead of being franic and trying to make sure I was doing it right.  It made me more introspective.

What I like:

*I am toning my body without high impact aerobics in a relaxed yet focused way.

*I get a good stretch and feel better after the workout than before.  With other workouts I didn't feel as energized as I do with NYCB.

*I feel taller and stronger.

*the dancers look so strong and inspire me.

What I don't like:

*I don't like the pauses between sets.

*I wish that I could just do part of the workout in the morning and the other part after supper.  There aren't any chapters and really there isn't a good stopping point.

Anyway, there are only a few minor things that I don't like. I am not a dancer and have no coordination at all but I can do it and I must be doing it right because I feel stronger.

I recommend this video to anyone who understands there is going to be a learning curve.  You won't get it the first time but after a few times you will and you will be stronger and more flexible because of it.  Also, I recommend this workout to anyone who is a little tired of the typical home workout videos with all of the rah rah and hoopla.",1152144000,29,2001,4.0126903553299496

If you have no ballet experience or the don't know the basics, the warm up is confusing.  The guidance disappears somewhere between and you're supposed to follow what the dancers are doing.",1151452800,3,345,4.813559322033898
1400815,4,B000056MMR,"I took a star off this one as I found that although the camera work is beautiful to look at - a spotlight with dancer in middle - the spotlight isn't quite big enough and the feet end up in the shadows so you can't see if the toes are pointing, flexed or turned out (especially in the floor work) added to this they are wearing dark shoes so hard to see at times.

The workout itself is fabulous and I don't understand the criticism from other reviewers.  If you are after a ballet dancing class that you can dance along with, this isn't for you (try NYCB 2 - I own this too and have reviewed it) - but this never claims to be a ballet class - it clearly states it is the workout the NYC ballet dancers use to get into shape and allow them to dance.  Ballet dancers do cross-train - they go to gym and do crunches and weights! (check out the video diaries in the 'extras' if you don't agree).

The workout is very user-friendly - split into 17 parts so you can do any/all with great floor and standing work for toning and balance.  I guess many of us who are used the constant cueing and counting of reps with conventional aerobics tapes find not being spoon-fed the routine a little frustrating. I think the cueing is a little lacking in parts here, but the routines are fairly short and the movements repetitive so they do become much easier each time you work out.  If you have prior pilates experience you will pick it up very easily.

If you only have the money to buy one ballet workout, I'd choose NYCB 2 over this one as the cueing is better, it has the end dance routine that is so much fun and there is more explanation of the moves (especially with the glossary).

Someone said Peter (he narrates) is snobbish and the dvd too arty.... I disagree! Peter speaks beautifully and has a lovely soothing accent, perhaps people interpret it as snobbish? and as for the dvd being arty - isn't ballet an art?  It is beautiful to look at and listen to.  It will leave you feeling taller and more toned (like pilates), but not exhausted.",1150329600,,2037,4.28125
1400816,1,B000056MMR,"I remember a few years ago the buzz about this 'next big thing' workout video was very big.  Sarrah Jessica Parker fresh off 'Sex and the City' fame even does a celebrity introduction in the video.  WHO CARES about celebrity endorsements, I just want the excercises to work.  But, I bought into the hype and got myself a copy.  At the time I was interested in starting adult ballet lessons and so this workout seemed to fit nicely with that.

  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.  I know everyone is fascinated with ballet and especially elegant, strong dancers' bodies -- but this video is NOT going to get you there.  This is probably the most artistic workout video I've seen, but as for INSTRUCTION it sucks.  It's not quite dance instruction or a workout instruction.

  You basically watch a bunch of very athletic people work out to classical music.  There is a very sedated man's voice who pops in once in a while to explain what might be going on, but mostly the dancers just do their thing and you have to figure out what they are doing.  There is little to no actual instruction, and the instructions themselves (when you get them) are REALLY not helpful.

  Do you know what first and third position in ballet is?  Should your feet be shoulder length apart or more, should your leg be at a 45 degree angle, should your feet be at an angle or straight?  Who the heck knows.  The people who made this video hopefully do, but THEY AREN'T TELLING.  You have know idea if your form is correct, either in terms of ballet, in terms of maximizing the stretches and moves, or in terms of potentially injuring yourself.

  Another example of how poor this excercise video is that many times, halfway through one of the excercises, the dancers start switching up their moves with no warning and you just have to figure out what they are doing.

  This video totally plays on people's desires to have a dancer's physique and the fact that people are intimidated by ballet and 'high art'.  The producers of the video are betting that most people will either be too intimidated to admit this is BAD WORKOUT VIDEO (because that would be admitting that they couldn't follow along and also criticizing ballerinas) or else be so enamored with the fact they are doing a ""real ballet workout"" that they won't notice that this isn't really a workout video.

 You basically watch a lot of very athletic people work out to classical music but as there's little narration, you have to do your best to keep up.

 Honestly, videos like this make me angry because they are such let downs.",1149552000,26,2562,4.572687224669603

I wouldn't recommend this--do pilates or yoga for muscular strength and stretch toning, and something more guided for cardio.

1400852,5,B000056MMR,"I have done ballet in the past for several years, though I am fat.  The first time I did this DVD was when I rented it and I could NOT get through the abs section.

Since then I am not doing ballet currently (due to injuries) but I am doing a lot of exercise at home.  Currently I've been doing a daily 15 min. with Yourself Fitness and also alternating daily Denise Austin pilates dvds.

So, because I've been doing pilates for a while on my abs I could get through the abs part of this, and it was still killer.

This DVD is what the ballet dancers do as a warm up to their 6-8 hour day of ballet training.  A warmed up body is excellent in order to do a full day of ballet training, as they do.  Which is why this DVD works every single muscle group.  And, I would say it's the most difficult exercise DVD I have in my current collection.  It's well worth it.  It is a little advanced for people that are really out of shape, but I bet if you are out of shape and did this daily for several months you'd be IN shape!

I have studied ballet before it has been a while so I don't remember all the positions and moves and I found the lack of explanation frustrating as some moves are easy to pick while others had me a little confused at first. It would have been helpful if they had explained the positions and techniques of certain moves. I don't think this is a good  DVD for someone who wants to learn ballet on their own but has some experience with it already.

1400855,2,B000056MMR,"Disclosure: I rented this video around the same time that I started a ""Ballet Body"" class at my local gym. Also, I've been doing Callanetics, which is ballet-inspired.

Other people here have mentioned that ballet terms are not explained (annoying, but you can deal with it), or that the narrator often does not give proper cues (actually very annoying, since he sometimes gives them, but at the wrong time, making it confusing even if you know what to do). Here are my problems with it:

1. I found the warmup horribly insufficient. That was not a warmup. That was barely a stretch.

2. As others here have mentioned, the long and unskippable pauses between sections make sure that any warmup will be useless.

3. The beautiful, artsy dark background and shots make it really difficult sometimes to see what the dancers are doing. How about some bright lighting, like the kind they have in their actual studios?

4. There really aren't enough repetitions of each move. Not even the crunches. I'm sorry, sixteen crunches is not going to do anything for anyone's abs. I really wish they hadn't tried to fit in so many different moves and combinations, and had just chosen a few good ones and made the most of them -- and by that I mean explaining proper technique, showing modifications, and doing them enough times to get the muscles to work a little.

I guess that any exercise is better than no exercise at all, but I have a hard time imagining seeing any physical improvement from this DVD. My class at the gym has more repetitions and more of an aerobic component, which allows for more of a workout. Meanwhile, Callanetics (or yoga) is much better at building flexibility and muscle tone. I think the NYC Ballet Workout would be lovely for someone who wanted to see different ballet moves, and I loved the extras, but there are better dance-inspired workout videos.",1138492800,14,1870,4.720858895705521
1400856,5,B000056MMR,"This reminds me of the first yoga class I went to at a gym. Sort of awkward, uncomfortable, and your muscles tremble because they haven't done this before (or in awhile.) It was challenging, but I feel like after a few more times, like yoga, it becomes less awkward, and it will get easier. It even comes with a little booklet in it which contains a picture glossary so beginners can see what some of the movements are. That was handy to look over before I tried this workout.

 It does feel like anyone can modify this workout to complete it. I definitely think this workout is going to yield some serious results. I don't even think I could do it ever day; I think I will have to rotate it with some cardio or something.

 The cinematography was nice, and it was nice to be able to choose either classical or contemporary music (personally I switched back and forth depending on what I was doing.) It is sort of choppy, but it's fine. The DVD extras are interesting, too- I particularly enjoyed the video diaries.

 One more thing I think is worth mentioning- I think that they do the perfect amount of reps for each exercize. I hate in other videos having to pause while I do more reps or just moving on and not feeling like I got all that I could out of the move, but in this video they do just enough- and one or two more!",1137628800,3,1327,4.266932270916334

In a nutshell, the exercises are great and will get your heart pumping, but the narration and cues are pretty terrible.  The narrator identifies the exercises -- i.e. plies, passes, etc. -- but he doesn't really describe the exercises most of the time, so you either have to know the terminology or watch the dancers closely to see what they're doing.  With a working knowledge of some basic ballet terms, this is not too much of a problem for most of the workout.  However, during the warm-up and certain Pilates-type exercises done while laying on the floor, you may need to watch and ""rewind"" first before trying the exercises.  The warm-up includes some fast footwork, and it's hard to do some of the floor exercises while still keeping an eye on the dancers.  Overall, though, I really enjoyed the workout, and the music and film quality is very good.  Also, the workout gets bonus points for the fact that, during some exercises, you can see the dancers' legs shaking slightly from the strain of holding certain positions.

A ballet workout should include true barre work - at the barre, and an instructional DVD of any kind, when produced with excellence, should allow skipping forward or backward to repeat specific portions, or momentary freezing of a frame for closer study.

The workout is excellent, though had I known before purchase that all the barre work was done on the floor, I would not have purchased it.  I purchased this DVD because I longed to do the barre work that I remembered from my ballet classes from my youth, knowing that at 58 years of age it would help me with balance, improve muscle-tone, and build strength in my abs, legs, knees and upper body.

I had more tone after, no problem following it even though I have NO ballet experience & no dance expreince. I am not in great shape, but not too bad with years of yoga & dance DVDs workouts a couple times a week for several years. I felt much more graceful after.

I have really tight tendons at the knee area that makes it hard for me to do leg lifts, etc. without feeling my joint has to go to unstable position to compensate for the restrictiviness of the tendons not allowing the joint to move correctly. The pliets really do stretch the area & the tendons/muscles by my knee feel much more loose/free after. This workout may even help cure my tightness problem.

That's what this video is for.  It's not a ballet class--that's why it's called a ""workout"", not a ""class"".  Floor barre is something entirely different from barre in class. it is, once again, meant to reinforce what you do in class, by using the same terminology and muscles but parallel to the floor instead of perpendicular, so you don't have to concentrate on lifting and holding your body weight and presenting your upper body. Hence the name FLOOR barre. Man cannot live by bread alone, just as REAL dancers cannot live by class alone.  If you want something to improve your ""posture or grace of movement"" go to dance class.

Besides, I think these people know what their doing--they're professionals at one of the most famous companies in the world.

Even if you aren't a dancer, this is a good workout.  But watch out for the terminology.

I like this video because it shows part of the other side of ballet-- the grueling, sweaty, not so ""fluffy pink tutu"" side- minus the bloody, blistered, bruised, and broken feet.",1112140800,3,1185,4.713592233009709
1400943,1,B000056MMR,"This is NOT a ""ballet"" workout.  Anyone who has taken even one ballet class knows that the work at the barre is the foundation of everything -- the barre is the source of the dancer's strength, flexibility, beautiful posture, grace.  THERE IS NO BARRE WORK in this so-called ""ballet"" workout.  Hence, you cannot rely on this DVD to help you achieve the dancer's posture, strength, and balance.

For example: this DVD includes SIT UPS.  No ballet teacher would EVER have dancers do sit ups -- though dancers have the strongest abdominals of any athletes.  Those strong abdominals derive from the work of  standing on one leg while extending the other leg, keeping both hips and shoulders perfectly level --  this work requires a very tight midsection.  In fact, these exercises -- always starting at the barre -- will produce a far flatter stomach than situps could ever achieve, partly because the traditional barre exercises are done while STANDING to train the dancer to hold her stomach flat, her ribcage high, and her spine long while she is standing, walking, and dancing.  Sit ups, performed flat on your back, do nothing to improve posture or grace of movement.

You could do this workout all day, every day, and you will never achieve a dancer's body because this routine lacks the fundamental work that is the foundation of the dancer's body.

Worst of all, this product doesn't even function as a DVD ought to: you can't skip back and forth between sections.  A total ripoff.

I have never had formal ballet training but I have learned a lot through books and I knew what the positions and ballet terms meant(the terms they use are in french)because of that.  The abdominal part is really difficult, something you may have to build up to doing the whole set of.  All together it is a really fun, and challenging work out.  If you are tired of the same traditional work outs and are looking for something to whip you into shape that is fun then you should go ahead and buy this, I love it and I know you will too!",1104624000,9,712,4.276119402985074

If you are not familiar with ballet simply watch the video first. of course of you watch it for the first time while trying to do it you will not be able to follow along. To point something else out. this is a Ballet Video not a kickboxing video. The narrators voice is soothing there would be no need for him to be shouting while you are trying to do ballet. I will say that there is no need to buy he second version of this CD because they both have the exact same content. This video has the best stretching exercise that I have ever done. I do the warm up on this video then do other videos in My collection. if you are looking to add variety to you workout this is a great video to add to your collection.,1088812800,3,796,4.070063694267516
1400993,5,B000056MMR,"The New York City Ballet Workout offers is a great program
combining toning, flexibillity and even a little cardio with the ballet combinations and ""little jumps"" section.  The hour it takes to complete seems to pass effortlessly- while the other tapes I have tried seem to drag along and leave me with a headache, instead of the renewed energy that this one gives me. Sure, its a workout, but it also leaves you feeling with a great sense of accomplishment and energy (and even after the first workout I felt ""fitter"" and it left me looking forward to the next time I would be able to play it).
I especially enjoyed the floor barre section- the stretches are hard (some of the things that the dancers can do seem impossible) but rewarding if you practice them, and your abs, back and arms get a really good workout (you'll be burning).  I found that one of the hardest things about the DVD was keeping my arms up during the combiniations- it got kind of hard to concentrate on the steps when I was focusing on having the proper position with my arms.
Some of the draw backs on this DVD are that if you don't have experience in ballet your might have trouble with some of the steps- they aren't explained by the narrater (the steps were easy for me because I have about five years of previous ballet experience).  Actually, the narrater doesnt really explain anything- you mosltly just have to follow the dancers (who are amazing, by the way).  I reccomend watching it over once before doing it so that on the floor bar you don't strain your neck by trying to do the excercise and watching the screen at the same time.
Another surprisingly thing about the DVD is that the extras are pretty cool- there are diaries of the dancers, interviews, and a ""behind the scenes"" section. They all offer an insight into the New York City Ballet Company.
In conclusion, I reccomend this DVD, but only to people who have a little experience in ballet.",1086307200,6,1937,4.541547277936963
1400994,4,B000056MMR,"This is a great DVD! It's great if you need some additional technique work at home or if you just want to stay in shape.  I would recommend that first time dancers take a beginner ballet class before trying this workout though, because you may not be able to follow everything and be able to do it correctly.  I use it when I have a break from classes or if I need some good stretching.  The music is great and I do enjoy the workout!",1082592000,3,434,4.08235294117647
1400995,3,B000056MMR,"Greetings. From the title of this review, you probably think I didn't really care for this workout, which isn't entirely true. Despite its relatively quick pace, it's a great introduction to ballet. The exercises will make you stronger and more graceful. However, I have two major issues with this DVD that force me to give it a three-star rating.
1) There are 17 sections of this DVD, each separated by a 15- to 30-second pause. I don't know why there isn't an option for the workout to run continuously because this pause is a real downer. Imagine this scene: you're doing grand battements. . .un, deux, trois, quatre. . .you're really starting to feel the burn. . .un, deux, trois, quatre. . .all of a sudden, the section is over and you're left staring at the practically blank screen while the next section is introduced. Fifteen seconds later, the workout begins again, but not after you've lost a lot of the energy you just acquired. Too bad.
2) This one is really unforgivable. Anyone who's ever taught a exercise class knows he or she must mirror the students not only in action but also in words. For instance, if you're facing the class and you ask them to do a tendu on the right, you must do it on the left BUT still say you're doing it on the right. The instructor on this DVD, Peter Martins, does not do this, which leads to a lot of confusion. You always have to remember to ignore what he's saying in order to perform the techniques correctly. This is a real disappointment because it's really a beginning instructor's mistake. I learned to stop doing this when I was 15 - a 40-something ballet master-in-chief should be skilled enough to have done this correctly.
Luckily, both of these problems are corrected in the second DVD, which also offers a challenging sequence from Balanchine's Tarantella. Skip this one and move on to that one. Trust me.",1080000000,15,1866,4.623493975903615
1400996,5,B000056MMR,"Okay, so I have no illusions about ever becoming a prima ballerina but this DVD allows me to pretend I could be:-) I have no dance experience to speak of so it took a couple of viewings (and research on the web) before I became familiar with all the terminology but I found that rather fun and very interesting. I picked this workout because I started to have back problems (I'm a sysadmin and spend most of my time crouched over a computer) and needed to build up strength. Also, because it isn't a workout specifically aimed at weight loss it suited me well as I am naturally slim and didn't want to lose what shape I have. Ballet seems to be about self-discipline and control. Obviously, I knew I wasn't going to be able to do the splits like the dancer does in the stretches section straight away but day by day I am getting closer. I first just started off doing one of the sports options but quickly found that I *wanted* to do more. It really doesn't feel like an hour at all and I find myself practising my tendus and plies when going to get a cup of coffee or cooking dinner (much to the amusement of my partner). Even after a couple of weeks, my posture had improved and my back stopped hurting. People rave about the photography and the beauty of the dancers - and I am not going to disagree but what I think is the best thing about this DVD is that it gives scope for daily improvement. Yes, if you are klutzy (like me) you will wobble about a bit with some of the exercises but when you manage to do your first arabesque raise properly you feel fantastic. In addition the classical soundtrack is so lovely, you can do this workout with someone else in the room and they won't object (unlike some of the high-burn-go-for-it-girlfriend workouts available). This DVD has inspired a love of ballet in me, I now read about it and am looking forward to attending a performance soon.",1078963200,2,1889,4.369318181818182
1401027,4,B000056MMR,"This DVD was not what I was good for, but I did work up a good sweat.....It's a Little bit of Yoga,Pilates, and Baic ballet warm-up. I can really tell you that my arms are look slimer. So if your getting tried for your reg.. yoga and pilates and would like a change, this would be very good to do..",1078012800,,298,3.9833333333333334
1401028,2,B000056MMR,"If you've even seen a video and thought to yourself ""what a fantastic concept!"" Only to search it out and be immensely disappointed?  That's how I felt with The New York City Ballet Workout.  There's no question that previous ballet experience is needed/recommended to do this ""workout"".  I've done yoga for quite a while I found this video to be much too advanced.  Section 1, the four dancers stand prepared, even spaced, feet parallel with their arms in position (port de bras) ready, against a blue backdrop. Martin's soft, warm voice begins to talk us through the exercises as the classical music begins. The first problem becomes instantly apparent: the technical ballet terms are not always explained. It is left to the person watching to figure it out for themselves if the do not already know. If you're co-ordinated and can follow what somebody else does easily then you'll work out pretty quickly that plie means knee bend. This part of the exercise involves mainly the upper body and an awful lot of bending sideways.
You then move on to the main part of the exercise video and the simplicity ends here.  This is probably the most difficult and painful part. A dancer lies on her back with her legs raised at a right angle to her body then moves her legs out sideways, toes pointing towards the ever nearing floor, until she has lowered them into the splits!  How many people do you know who can do this?  Pass on this video.",1076889600,5,1437,4.6561264822134385
1401029,5,B000056MMR,"Wonderful overall workout! I found the exercises easy to follow, as they are performed at a slow pace.

1401031,4,B000056MMR,"I was referred to the NYCBW by a school gym teacher who let me borrow the video for a weekend.  Although I do not have any past experience in dance, I was hooked because I had been looking for a workout which addressed stretching and toning to complement my running program.  This video workout is one of the better routines for all-around toning, stretching, and strengthening.
I'll let the other reviews discuss the workout's contents.  Overall, my take is that the warm-ups get the blood flowing and the muscles going.  The strengthening and toning exercises work several muscle areas at a time, you really feel the burn.  The remaining content works the entire body.  You really feel invigorated at the end.  I was impressed by how keeping your arms out works your upper body muscles.  Make sure you do the reverence at the end.  I found it made a difference in how you come out of the workout.  The bonus features provide a behind-the-scenes look at the video's making, as well as features of each dancer in the video which I found informative.
I gave a four-star rating because my content criticism would be a desire for more stretching exercises and a bit less toning exercises.  The technical editing of the video left something to be desired in that there are a couple of video editing goofs as well as some spots where the audio doesn't quite match what's on screen.  Also, film was selected over video, an odd choice to me in this digital age.  It's a workout video, not film noire.  As for the music, you have a choice of classical music or soft pop.  Haven't heard the latter, always choosing the former which is probably more appropriate for the genre of the workout.  The dancers demonstrate the exercises in an exemplary manner.  It's easy to think you look like them as you do the exercises.
Overall, this is an excellent video for someone looking for a toning/stretching/strengthening exercise video.  Doing the workout three times a week has resulted in toned legs, abs, shoulders, and pecs, stronger arms thanks to the push ups, and improved posture.  I liked it so much I bought Volume 2.  See my review of that one as well.",1074556800,8,2145,4.669333333333333
1401032,2,B000056MMR,"According to the former feedbacks, I thought this DVD should be challenging or interesting. However,I was disappointed by not learning anything new and inspiring. Also, I disliked the dumbness of the dancers. It's more like a gym class than a ballet instruction.",1073260800,,262,5.261904761904762
1401033,1,B000056MMR,"I am a professional dancer and this video is neither a good basic ballet class nor a good workout.  As every dancer knows, even a basic ballet class can be an oportunity to work on technique and strength.  This video does not deliver.  The ""barre"" exercises, done in centre, were far too brief to exercise the muscles and far too simple to exercise even the mind.  I feel sorry for non-dancers purchasing this video, thinking that they are getting an education in dance.  More likely they are damaging their precious bodies by trying to emulate what the NYC dancers are doing without any instruction.  And why can we not edit a dance video to go with the music as opposed to in spite of it?  Visually this DVD is gorgeous, but never challenged my flexibility, strength, or creative mind.  I guess it is better than sitting on the couch, but so is walking around the block, and at least there's fresh air out there....",1070236800,18,917,4.548780487804878
1401034,4,B000056MMR,"This workout is fun.  However it is like coming into a class in the middle where everyone else knows that moves so there is little instruction.  The narrator seems like he has a script but doesn't really know when to say what.  At one point he just says, ""rather than listening to me watch the dancers.""  The dancers start doing a cool down routine where it is hard to watch what they are doing and do it at the same time.  I'm sure that it won't be too hard after doing it a few times though, and it is fun to do ballet steps and act like a dancer.
There is a pretty good warm up and toning section at the beginning that includes abs and leg exercises done while lying on the floor.  Then there are short exercises that each introduces a new move (the moves aren't really introduced in the sense that you are told how to do them correctly, though).  The whole workout is done in short segments that are put together in different ways at the end for specific types of sports workouts, but I found that the whole workout isn't really that strenuous, so doing less than the whole thing isn't really that useful",1069891200,,1108,4.2727272727272725
1401035,4,B000056MMR,"This is a wonderful workout. I always loved ballet class when I was younger. Ballet is one of the best ways to get in and keep in shape. It strenghtens without bulking you up. This video allows you to take a class without the use of a barre, which is very convenient when working out at home in your living room.  Most of the ""barre"" work is done on the floor so I would suggest using an exercise mat or a towel for a little extra cushioning. The only complaint I have is Peter Martin's instructions.  They either run ahead or fall behind what is actually going on. This makes it more of a watch and follow along workout. Also, if you are not familiar with ballet lingo and movement it may take you a little while to get the hang of it. But trust me, you CAN do it and will get easier! If you want a change from the same old aerobic workout you should give this a try.",1069718400,,868,4.0701754385964914

It made me beleive that I can stay in shape and improve even though it will be a while before I am in a dance class again. I am most grateful to the crew for creating this piece. This is a very elegant serious and exceptionally beautiful piece of work. It seems that some people  are looking for a ballet lesson in it or a workout for  dummies experience.

This is a fantastic workout with so much toning, strengthening and aerobic work.  I always recommend it to friends who have never taken ballet but are thinking about taking an adult class.  The basic ballet movements are easy to pick up and exercises on the floor strengthen the muscles you need to achieve the turnout for them.

This workout is supposedly what they do to get in shape, and it is absolutely BORING.  The narrorator's voice is too slow and announces what the dancers are doing, which is the opposite of what you should be doing.  It's confusing.  And, each section of workout is in a blank room that is visually uninspiring as is the music (classical).  I did not listen to the critics of this dvd and I got it anyway.  Bad idea.

1401061,3,B000056MMR,"This DVD stars four dancers from the New York City Ballet and they really are gorgeous. In fact that seems to be the main point of this product - showing off how gorgeous the dancers are. I think presenting an exercise programme was really a secondary consideration. The exercises are fine, they will do a good job of toning, stretching and relaxing you, and if (as many reviewers seem to be) you are used to hype-y aerobic videos, this will be a refreshing change.
However I do have a few complaints.
- Not much safe dance practise at all!!! None in the narrative and almost none in the notes. The demonstration, camera work and instruction both verbal and written assumes a lot of background knowledge about dance. For a person who did not know their body very well, this video could actually be dangerous (despite the repeated warnings in the notes that you, not they, are responsible for your own body).
- Peter Martins narration is nice, his accent and voice are pleasant but to me, his arrogance (and body obsession) came over in his interview, and during the workout, his use of ballet terms and lack of instruction. He says to watch the form of the dancers, however the lighting is often not good enough to show all the correct form.
- The camera work is too artistic  it is undoubtedly beautiful, however this is essentially an exercise video, and the glorification of the bodies of the dancers occurs at the cost of clarity for the viewer/exerciser. Sometimes you just cant see clearly what the crucial leg (or other limb) should be doing.
- The focus on long lean bodies made me want to vomit. The product gives the impression (which I suppose they do in order to boost sales) that by doing this video you can end up looking like the dancers on the video. This is a fallacy, as these dancers are not only *born* with coltish (and, it could be claimed, unnatural) figures, but also they have trained heavily from a very, very young age, which (especially for the girls) holds back the development of a more womanly shape.
- The menu selections were not very clear  you cant see a list of all exercises and what they are, and this isn't in the notes either.
- There is no play all option for the features. Also its not clear what some of the features are.
- The shooting is very gorgeous, that is a big plus, and just as well!",1049846400,37,2335,4.491764705882353
1401062,2,B000056MMR,"I was so excited when I found this ballet workout on DVD because I love having the flexibility to quickly skip over stuff if I'm pressed for time or if I only want to work a certain area that day.
Unfortunately, with this DVD either you have to watch the whole thing from the beginning (including Sarah Jessica Parker's intro... EVERYTIME)without even being able to fast forward like you can with video, or you can watch chapter by chapter but then the DVD returns you to the menu at the end of EVERY segment (there are 17 of them)and you have to get the remote and scroll around for the next section.
At first I thought the reason I couldn't just easily skip from chapter to chapter using the ""skip"" button may just be my DVD player (it's old) but then I tried it on a friend's brand new one and it had the same problem.
I sincerely hope they remedied this situation on the NY City Ballet Workout 2 that is coming out May 2003.
Other than this technical glitch, it's a great workout; very fun to watch and do.  But now I only do it if I can clear a big block of time.  If I knew the DVD format had this problem, I would have purchased the video.",1049241600,8,1146,4.180995475113122

The dancers in here are actual NYC Ballet dancers and it's a real program that they use to keep up their flexibility and sculpt their muscles.  I have to say that not being a big fan of classical music, this was not encouraging.  A good beat makes you want to workout, but this didn't make me feel like that, so thankfully there is an option to change the music to a more contemporary track.  The workout itself is about 50 minutes or so, and I'd suggest doing it on light days only, because otherwise, I don't imagine seeing great results.",1047168000,,802,4.209150326797386
1401064,5,B000056MMR,"I thought I had ordered the book, but I mistakenly ordered the DVD...one of the best mistakes I ever made. I have been doing ballet off and on thru the years, and about a year ago, I returned to a daily regimen. Being I am opening a ballet studio this year, and being I wanted a supplement for my own off practice days, this DVD will be a requirement for the students and fills in the gap for me.  The presentation itself of the dancers and the classical music is beautiful and can be very motivating. Before actively taking part in the exercises myself, I studied the entire DVD, and the next day, I was able to keep up with the exercises okay. If you are a first time exerciser, or a ballet beginner or returning to ballet, I do recommend the use of a barre or the kitchen counter for support. During the exercising, sometimes I wobbled and lost my balance...sometimes I did not. The next time I use this DVD, I will use my portable barre until I have built up my balancing, and I do suppose the more the exercises are done, the better the balancing will be. The exercises themselves are wonderful...especially the sets for the abdominals. Although there are no arm exercises, you will feel the tension and the stress build up in your upper arms because of keeping the arms extended out to your sides during many of the exercises. Another thing...I just ordered the book today. I think the book will be a nice supplement to the DVD to where the exerciser can make up their own sequence if they choose by studying the book. Each of the four dancers are interviewed and they explain why they chose ballet as a career and the negative and positive aspects of choosing such a career. A great DVD for yourself and/or for your students!",1045267200,3,1732,4.429467084639499
1401065,5,B000056MMR,"I love this DVD.  So many DVD workouts are fast paced and frantic-I am edgy and exhausted by the end of them and I go to the office in a bad mood.  This one is slow, relaxing and methodical; I find after a workout, I am relaxed and psychologically centered as well as stretched out and strengthened.  I don't go a day without it; I do all 17 sections because I love them.  If that is too much of a time issue for you, you could do 10 or 12; but I wouldn't miss the 'Reverence' section at the end.  It is a cool down/stretcher, plus provides psychological closure to the workout; something I typically don't get in other workouts.  If you are looking for a 'cardio-burn', this isn't your workout.  I have back and hip problems, so it is perfect for me with all the stretching.  My back felt better 3 days after I started doing this workout; when I do another 'cardio-burn' DVD I have my back hurts until I can do this one.  Needless to say, I don't do the 'cardio-burn' DVD very often.
As a child/teenager, I took ballet, so I understand the movements and terminology, but even if you have no ballet experience, I don't think it would be difficult-just watch the dancers.  Everything is slow and methodical; so you can follow along easily.",1045267200,,1238,4.366812227074236
1401096,5,B000056MMR,"I had been searching for a work out that is  the absolute opposite of the knee jerking workout with Aerobics divas,loud music and soon to be dated hairdos and outfits for a very long time. This is the perfect find!
I did it one hour before bedtime and it relaxed me as well as challenged my body. I was slightly sored the next day but not to the point of being  uncomfortable. I have lower back problems and my problem was addressed in the DVD, modifications were suggested for people who could not perform some of the exercises comfortably. I agree with other reviewers that you need to have notions of ballet to be able to follow the pace of the DVD but it's not a big challenge for a neophyte if that person takes the time to learn the feet positions and the name for the different movements. I loved the fact that you can design your own work out. I especially liked the floor barre exercises that can be performed by people who are overweight,disabled,or have a limited range of motion while standing up.
Another bonus is that this work out is totally classy without being condescendent to the viewer, the narration is soothing but doesn't  put you to sleep.",1045180800,,1163,4.476415094339623

If you read the other reviews, they will support this suggestion, because the people who hated it had never studied ballet, before. I studied dance for eight years, but, hadn't danced in over 15, when I bought this DVD. By the third time through, I was completely confident in what I was doing and could focus on the quality of my movements, instead of just ""keeping up"". So, don't think you have to be taking classes *now* for it to be any use...just sometime in your past.",1042416000,6,640,4.478632478632479
1401098,5,B000056MMR,"The New York City Ballet Workout is an excellent workout, however challenging it may be.  Even for me, a teenager who had almost 10 years of ballet experience in my life, this video has it's challenging aspects.  The exersices are fairly simple, but take a lot of effort and muscle strength to perform them.  If you haven't had any previous ballet training, the workout can be hard to follow as well, being as how they simply say the name of the move, and then do it, without any real explanation on how to go about performing it.  However, after a few times of doing the workout, I think just about anyone could catch on.  It's also a rather lengthy video, it takes about 60 minutes to get through the 17 exersices, so it may be more practical to do half of the workout at a time.  Also, the ballet dancers who do the  workout on the DVD are more flexible than just about anybody that might buy the DVD, so when they go through the stretches, it seems impossible to copy their movements exactly, but it's easy to modify the movements to your own strength and flexibility. This workout really strengthens and tones your muscles, as well as improves your flexibility, posture and balance.  After just a week of doing at least half of the video each day, I was already noticing differences in my muscle tone and flexibility.  I definitly recommend this video, more to people who know at least a little bit of ballet terminology, but anyone can get the basic jist of the workout if they do it a few times and put in the effort to learning the proper form of the moves.",1042416000,30,1565,4.425087108013937
1401099,5,B000056MMR,"I've had some dance training, so I understood basic ballet terms such as plie and releve. This was one of the best workouts I've ever had - it's amazing to think that this is their daily warmup. The DVD offers two different music choices, and you can specialize the kind of workout you want. Although the movements seem slow, repeated use of the DVD will build and tone muscles.

1401100,5,B000056MMR,"This is the first review I have taken the time to write.  Which says alot!  I am over 40 and have found an exercise routine that doesn't pop my hips from kick boxing.
With a few ballet classes in college many years ago, I was able to adapt to this tape very easily.  My goal was flexibility and the tape delivers this in stars.  Within two weeks my body had a very different look to it from the stretching and toning that this program imbues.  My flexibility, poise, posture all changed with these exercises.  Being consistent with an exercise program is not one of my strengths.  BUT even after I had gotten off track with doing this tape; I always found my way back to it because of the quick results I got, the minimal time commitment (1/2 hr.per/day, doing warm ups and floor ex. only) and the way these exercises made me feel after doing them.  This tape is a winner for me!",1039478400,2,879,4.317073170731708
1401101,1,B000056MMR,"As an athlete that many acquaintences consider ""hardcore,"" I deeply hated this tape. Unless you have been a professional ballet dancer your entire life, there is no way you would know how to do any of these moves. There is no instruction anywhere on the tape. If you want to watch 75-pound adults sway their arms for half an hour, this is for you. If you want a workout, stay as far away from this tape as you possibly can. This is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen in my life.",1038873600,5,487,4.191489361702128
1401102,4,B000056MMR,"This DVD is excellent for toning and lengthening your muscles, and will definitely work up a sweat.  The workout is divided into 17 segments, which can be viewed all at once, one at a time, or as part of four sections.  Exercises 1-4 are warm ups, includes some dance steps that get your blood pumping and some nice stretching.  5 & 6 work your abdominals.  7-9 are ""floor barre,"" which means you lie on your back and keep everything stable except the moving leg -- very effective.  10-16 are leg work, such as degagees, tendus, and grand battements.  Finally, 17 is a cooldown with some stretching.  Note that there is no instructor-led dance segment after all that barre/center work, as there is in a dance class.
There is one main thing I don't like about this DVD -- the verbal cuing is terrible.  At the very end, the narrator says, ""Rather than follow my instructions, follow the dancers, the music, and listen to your body.""  Yeah, well, tell me how to follow the dancers with my face in my knees.  A few viewings should make this much less of a problem, but the first times through may be frustrating, especially during the (almost silent) cooldown, when your neck is craned around to see what's going on.
I don't know if someone with no ballet experience would find this DVD very rewarding.  Although no special equipment is required, there is no explanation of technique, and the narrator makes frequent use of ballet terminology.  Perhaps in conjunction with one of the ballet instruction videos or books, this would be better for beginners, but I think a semester of ballet classes would be more reward for the money in that case.
Given those caveats, this is a great workout to intersperse with your other strength and aerobics workouts.",1033430400,233,1750,4.701639344262295
1401103,5,B000056MMR,"I love this workout!!
First of all, I'd like to point out that although I have no dancing experience, I had no problem catching on simply by attempting the workout a few times.  I may have looked like a total clutz, but hey, that's the beauty of working out at home, right?  But really, this workout is for ANYONE, not just experienced dancers, as I've seen claimed in some reviews.  Watch your form, don't expect to look like a ballerina the first time through, and prepare yourself for some muscle soreness the next day!
This video is a great complement to any workout regime.",1032393600,,578,4.538461538461538
1401104,5,B000056MMR,"What a great time I have with this DVD!  I only bring it out when no one else is around to see how hilarious I must look!  But that's the great part -- I just relax and have fun.  Sure I can't do all the moves (not yet anyway), but who cares?  I get a fantastic fluid motion workout.  Most of the Pilates/Yoga tapes & DVDs are so slow, one exercise at a time.  And the aerobic-type, high-impact bouncing is so ""over.""  But this ballet workout DVD is just perfect.  I get a fantastic workout and use lots of muscles.  At first, while the dancers performed a series of movements multiple times, I would only get one series right.  It moves right along!  But gradually I caught on.  The music is beautiful and you can select either a classical or a contemporary soundtrack for the background.  There's so much material -- lots of workout segments, plus segments on ballet, dancers, NYC.  You'll never get tired of this one.  Truly a great DVD -- but you gotta relax and go with the flow, 'cause you won't be able to do it perfectly at first, and maybe you never will.  I absolutely love this treasure -- think I'll sneak off and pop it in right now!",1030060800,9,1146,4.285046728971962
1401135,4,B000056MMR,"I recently purchased the NYCB workout on DVD and was very impressed.  The workout reminds me a lot of a ballet class I was taking 6 months ago that I couldn't continue because of conflicting schedules.  Now I can continue the dance I so enjoyed at home.  I really like that the program is designed for you to follow along with the dancers.  That way the workout does become too slow once you master the moves.  I'll admit it was a little tricky in some parts in the beginning, but the DVD allows you to repeat sections as often as you desire to perfect the moves.  It also allows you to focus on certain body parts or shorten your workout if your pressed for time.  All in all I highly recommend this video to anyone who has an interest in ballet.",1028592000,,747,4.25531914893617
1401136,4,B000056MMR,"As gracefull as ballet dancers seem, it's not easy.  They work hard at their craft and it shows extremely well in this DVD.  The excercises will challenge your resistance, strenght and coordination, but isn't that what you're working at?
  I owned the VHS but changed to the DVD mainly because of the alternative contemporary soundtract, not that there is anything bad about the classical, it's just that the contemporary soundtrack matches the excercises better in my opinion.  Another bonus is that you get ""the making of"" and sport specific excercises with the DVD and a day in each dancer's life in both the VHS and the DVD.
  The only thing that I don't like about the workout is that the cueing is not always accurate, right or left get confussed and in some of the floor excercises you see some of the dancers move to the next excercise without being cued and some other dancers still on the same excercise.
  However, this is a workout that truly works, you WILL become more flexible, balanced and strong if you stick to it.",1027123200,5,1032,4.657458563535911
1401137,2,B000056MMR,"I was intrigued by this video, since I have a dance background and have taken a couple ballet courses in college. However, I found the frequent ballet terms difficult to follow and the instructions lacking. Unlike ""normal"" exercise tapes, there was little introduction to movements and injury prevention (especially when working on back muscles). The tape was a nice change from my other tapes, and I did feel the workout, but I would only recommend this to seasoned dancers and exercise enthusiasts.",1026864000,9,500,5.109756097560975

But if you ever had any ballet training, even just a little, this one is a very good work-out.

1401140,4,B000056MMR,"This video will give you a good workout if you stick with it and try to improve each time. You will see results in stregth, posture and flexibility. I have some background in ballet so I didn't have the problem that i think the average viewer would, which is that he uses ballet terms without describing them. It's basically a ""watch and do"" video, but is inconsistent in that it takes greater time with some things and less at others. I find it helpful because I need a class or tape to follow along to or I just won't finish my workout. It won't make you sweat, necessarily, however you get out of it what you put in. If you take the time to stretch a little bit further each time, and push yourself then it's a great video. I'm trying to get back into shape for dance and for me it really serves my purpose. I thought it was a little too ""Presentational"" for my taste, showing off the dancer's moves and bodies (in smoke backgrounds) more than actually helping you to achieve proper form. The narrator's cues are often way off from the movements that the dancers are doing, which I find pretty annoying, but I still think you can get a lot out of this DVD. I recommend the DVD over the video because you can skip the introduction easily or skip to any part of the workout, in case you decide to only do certain parts each day or want more conditioning in one area. For ballet dancers: It is comprised of basic exercises, from a basic warmup, to some stretching, then tendu, degage, grand battement, plie, passe, etc. For non ballet dancers, it's a chance to learn (by watching) what all of those things I just mentioned are.",1017705600,58,1627,4.372937293729373

It is helpful to have previous dance experience, but it's not necessary at all. I found it to be more helpful to turn off the narration on the DVD and watch the dancers. Maybe if you're starting out, it would be best to watch the DVD all the way through, to learn some of the movements before attempting them yourself.

It takes time to get through the whole workout if you are not in shape... but, stick with it!  Some workout videos can get a little repitious,but this one is great... the music and narrator are soothing and encouraging (not annoying).

1401143,2,B000056MMR,"After recovering from having my first child and rebounding from a relatively fit pregnancy, I hoped to find a workout routine I could do at home that would strengthen my weak spots and firm up my abs and stomach that softened over nine months of modified activity.  This is not the workout to achieve that.  This workout is meant for someone who is extremely flexible with an innate sense of grace and balance that I just do not possess.  Even some of the simplest leg lifts seem unnatural to a non-professional dancer.  Rotating the foot completely to one side and lifting the leg offers a strain I wasn't ready for, and my right leg now suffers a severe strain in the hip joint.
Some of the exercises are really challenging and offer a good workout for muscles that have gone unused in many people, but I was looking for a more all-body workout, and this one concentrates mostly on the lower body.  The abdominals and leg darts are great exercises, and I get the most out of those and the floor barre, but there are so few of them, and I feel that once I really start feeling the burn and effects of the exercises, we've moved on to the plies and unintentional acrobatics.
The warm-up took me a week and a half to get down, having done it every day and messing up a lot of the moves, and I still stumble through the third section.  I laugh at the same point in the video every day when the instructor tells you not to sacrifice the form in order to get the most out of the exercise...meanwhile, I'm doing a balancing act, twisting my ankle, and straining my back in order to simply regain my balance, let alone do the exercise correctly and ""emulate the proper form"".
Perhaps it's me, and I was never meant to train like a dancer trains, but this workout requires maximum balance, maximum coordination, and maximum flexibility, and if you don't possess each of these qualities in perfect capacity, you're screwed.  Many of the exercises seem impossible, and you wonder if you're getting anything out of them because you can't perfectly mimic the form of the sculpted dancer on the screen.  Losing your balance and twisting your leg or foot make it difficult to focus on the workout, and you need a shaman's focus and patience in order to get through it.  It also seems long for an hour, probably due to the repetition of exercises and muted colors.
As a DVD, it is terrible.  I should have saved the extra few dollars and gone for the VHS.  There are certain sections I need to skip now because of the strain in my right leg (that becomes inflamed immediately once the warm-up starts), and in order to skip to the next section, you have to fast forward through the moves in the current section.  There are no clean cut chapters unless you go to the Exercises section, and once you complete one given section, you are taken back to the menu and have to repeat the process again and again in order to get the workout that fits you.  That breaks your focus and motivation, and it makes the process that much longer and more frustrating.
There are a couple of sections where the audio is a little off, so the instructor is telling you to do something you've either already completed or haven't gotten to yet.  Also, there is a stretching section where there seems to be a glitch.  One minute, the dancer is stretching her right leg into the air.  You blink, and her left leg is in the air.  You hurry to catch up, and ultimately only one leg ends up getting the most out of the stretching routine.  Most frustrating.
As a plus, though, my four month old gets a good laugh out of my balancing act, so at least it keeps her entertained while I work out.
I will look for a more complete workout that an average individual can properly perform (hopefully without injury), and I will certainly seek a better quality DVD format.  Not recommended.",1012521600,5,3838,4.472779369627507
1401144,3,B000056MMR,"No doubt Peter Martins is used to giving minimal instruction to his professional dancers.  I could have used a great deal more instruction.  You must keep an eye on the dancers at all times, which is admittedly enjoyable but sometimes quite difficult, especially during the floor work.  Martins gives instructions sometimes before the dancers do that exercise, but usually after, and sometimes not at all.  He occasionally throws in directional instructions, so if you've been mirroring the dancers you may find that halfway through a section you're now being instructed to move to your right instead of your left.  If you don't have a clear sense of what you've already done, this can be confusing.
For these reasons, the warm-ups are nearly impossible.
The workout itself is outstanding.  Although I'm in pretty good shape (for a mere mortal,) I found it to be rather challenging.  The key is to watch the dancers and imitate their form, and maintain an awareness of your own body.  I suspect a mirror would be enormously helpful.
Unlike a lot of workouts I've tried, you don't need a room the size of the Lincoln Center to do this workout.  You will need room to stretch out on the floor, and you'll need enough room to take about three steps to the right and left, and three or four steps behind you.  This workout can probably be done in a small apartment.
The classical music soundtrack is good.  The contemporary music soundtrack is not bad, though the music for the floor barre section struck me as sounding like a soundtrack to a porn movie.  Perhaps I was still grumpy from the warm-ups.
While I don't use this DVD on a daily basis, I do use it once or twice a week to break up the routine of my normal workout, and as a good full-body workout.  If you have the patience to try to learn basic ballet moves by watching the dancers, I highly recommend it.",1012348800,7,1863,4.609090909090909

to follow because I had learned the basics already.  One good thing about this was that the barre work is done on the floor, so you don't have to worry about finding a barre - it's a unique approach that works well for someone doing this at home.  I also liked the approach to the ab workout. I really felt that my arms, legs, and abs all got a good stretching and strengthening.

The 4 dancers illustrating the moves are inspiring and I found it easy to follow. Mind you, not easy to do, not yet. I expect it to take a little time to develop my form and coordination but then those dancers didn't do it in a day either. Even so, the majority of the workout is easy to follow as long as you know that the dancers are working at their best form and you can do everything with smaller moves than theirs and work your way up to it - and this is also well explained in the booklet that comes with the DVD. The added features - the individual interviews with the 4 dancers are also inspiring. You find that, yes, they also have had hurdles to climb with physical challenges, illness, injury and so on. The interviews with Peter Martins and other individuals involved in the making of this DVD gave a lot of interesting background on the NYC ballet.
This DVD is beautifully done and the workout is challenging - not in a ""jump up and down and go crazy"" kind of way but in a way that works out the muscles with control, grace and a lot of hard work to reach your goal.

This DVD primarily focuses on the lives of the showcased dancers and that's it!  It's a glamour shot for NYC ballet dancers and a very immodest ego puffer for them.  I studied ballet for 8 years and really wanted a nice ballet workout. This doesn't work you out at all.  There's a slightly nice ab workout but it's not long enough or repetitve enough to do any good.  Ballet can be a wonderful workout as well as a calming and healing excercise.

I can do this workout after my kid goes to bed (quiet enough so I don't wake her) and it is relaxing at the same time so I don't have to worry about not sleeping.  If you don't like Ballet or you like up tempo butt-shaking jumping around workouts, then obviously you should pass on this one and look for a workout that fits your personality. It says Ballet so it means Ballet and has the music that goes with Ballet.  Out of all the dvd workouts I have done over the years, this one, hands down, is my favorite.",1510790400,,1229,4.104166666666667

7932758,4,B000056MMR,"I love this workout dvd. I've never had any ballet classes but they make it easy to follow. It feels more like a class then a workout and I look forward to the workout. I'm not the most graceful but this has helped me with my posture and flexibility. I really enjoy this workout dvd, just make sure you have plenty of room as there's lots of kicking, jumping, and stretching involved.",1473465600,,384,4.347222222222222
