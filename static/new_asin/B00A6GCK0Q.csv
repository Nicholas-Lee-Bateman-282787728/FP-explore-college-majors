8546904,5,B00A6GCK0Q,"This short film was pretty good, considering I don't really watch movies in this genre. The characters are very believable and the scriptwriter knows how to write a good story, which is very important. I highly suggest checking out Pandora and be on the watch out for Jay Burton's other films.",1372636800,,293,4.764705882352941

8546907,5,B00A6GCK0Q,"When I purchased this suspense-thriller movie, I was looking for something to get my attention, and draw me in with the story. There aren't too many blockbuster movies that do that for me any more. BUT THIS ONE DID! Very steady pase, nothing was rushed, and the suspense just kept building up all the way to the end. There was also a great choice in music for this movie. Everything was fit for every scene.

All of the actors did a great job, especially the main character, and the doctor! The end was a real brain-twister. This is definitely a movie I will recommend to people when they are in the mood for a good movie.",1354924800,,622,4.362068965517241
8546908,5,B00A6GCK0Q,"I  enjoyed this taunt thriller of a movie.  It is the story of a young woman who has lost her Father at an early age and how she deals with it.
This is kind of a dark story line but there is humor through out the movie so it flows very well.
The story is centered on the main character, Victoria, but the rest of the cast do a very credible job of letting her tell the story.

I especially liked the music that accompanies the story but the Director knows when no sound is required except the sound of what is happening.

The star of the movie is Jennifer Burton in her debut performance in a motion picture.  She is excellent.  She conveys the emotions of Victoria with a natural ease.  This is not a screaming ,slasher type of thriller but rather a movie you think about as it is unfolding and afterward.

I enjoyed it more the second viewing than the first.  Lots of little details embedded in this movie.",1354665600,,908,4.232558139534884
