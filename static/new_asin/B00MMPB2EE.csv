We had it on vhs and on the move we lost it.
Surprise he asked for this cartoon this year.",1509580800,,208,3.75
8672985,2,B00MMPB2EE,"HOW THE TOYS SAVED CHRISTMAS is a charming children's Christmas movie but it's not very adult friendly. While it has an interesting story, it's pacing problems are so severe as to make the viewers mind go numb from boredom. At 78 minuets barely an over hour it feels twice as long. If you have young this might entertain them but I recommend skipping it if you are over the age of 7",1447977600,,382,4.319444444444445
