2069251,4,B000291Q66,"My son just recently discovered Blue from his older sister's toys and DVDs. He loves this DVD so much, he walks around carrying it and looking at the picture when he's not watching it. I bought this DVD as a replacement for the first copy which got totally scratched up. Blue's Clues is getting harder and harder to find, so I was happy to find it here and for a great price!",1208217600,,375,4.222222222222222
2069252,3,B000291Q66,it's ok the first time around but not a dvd that kids like to watch over and over,1181260800,,81,3.5555555555555554
2069253,5,B000291Q66,"My son, who just turned two, absolutely loves this DVD.  There are five episodes on one DVD, two Blue's Room, one with Joe and two with Steve.  It's a great mix of stories.  My son giggles through the whole thing!  And it's not mind-numbing like some other kids shows.",1154995200,3,268,4.408163265306122

this dvd has a vareity and is educatrional and interesting.",1127865600,,227,4.357142857142857
2069255,4,B000291Q66,"This is one of the first Blue's Clues DVDs with the ""new"" program formatting... where Blue becomes a puppet in the ""Blue's Room"" segments of the show (instead of being ALL a cartoon figure). This particular DVD has three Blue's Clue's episodes and one ""Blue's Room"" only episode, which all feature ""food"" items. The food items mostly surround a Birthday theme, so this is a great DVD to watch with your child around their Birthday time. :) Although I personally like the three full-length episodes's format over the ""Blue's Room only"" episode, I found this DVD very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.",1115942400,8,602,4.854368932038835
2069256,5,B000291Q66,"To correct Logan and avoid any confusion, this DVD is not a collection of the Blue's Room shorts-- rather, it contains as its spotlight the first Blue's Room half-hour special, and some episodes from Blue's Clues.",1087948800,2,213,4.944444444444445
