1623930,5,B00005M20M,"Since I grew up in Fargo, NoDak, of COURSE I knew about Roger Maris and his '61 in 1961' legend. In fact, one of my relatives used to help volunteer at the annual Roger Maris Celebrity Golf Tournament, which raises money for Shanley High School (Roger's alma mater) and the Roger Maris Cancer Center. So I was really looking forward to seeing the film, 61*, when it appeared on HBO this spring. I was not disappointed!
Even if you aren't a baseball fan, you will really love this film. It's a story about friendship, about persevering in spite of everything, and how perceptions can be made (or broken) by the media. If you love baseball, I think you will LOVE this story. It has everything. I think Billy Crystal spun some magic here to make this story come to life. If you can, get the DVD version when this movie comes out, because the ""Making of"" featurette is wonderful. Billy shows how they took Tiger Stadium in Detroit and made it into the Yankees Stadium of old. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane are absolutely fantastic as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. The rest of the cast are splendid, too.
I can't keep from saying more nice things about this film. I am anxiously awaiting its release to DVD. I definitely want to own a copy of this, along with the special features.
Now if the Hall of Fame would just find it in their collective hearts to induct Roger Maris, I would be a happy fan.",993945600,21,1393,4.4453125
1623940,5,B00005M20M,"Two things I have a great affinity for is movies and baseball. So I really have a great affinity for movies about baseball. Over the years I have seen some outstanding baseball films including ""Field Of Dreams"", ""42"", ""Bull Durham"" and ""Eight Men Out"". Recently I had the chance to see an excellent made for HBO film about the 1961 baseball season. That was the year that two New York Yankee players were in a head to head race to see who would be the first to break Babe Ruth's record for most homeruns in a season. Set in 1927 The Babe smacked 60 homeruns that year. A record that many thought would never be broken. But as the old saying goes records are made to be broken. And in 1961 the homeruns mark would fall. No doubt of that. The question was to who?

In '61 it would come down to two teammates who were the best of friends and at the same time two totally different personalities. One of them was Mickey Mantle, adored and worshipped by Yankee fans everywhere. The other, Roger Maris, was treated like an outsider. It didn't matter he wore the Yankee pinstripes, to many Yank fans he was unpopular. He didn't start his career with the Yankees. He was traded to the team the year before from Kansas City. He would go on to win the American League MVP award. Still the fans didn't embrace him the way they did Mickey. So as the 1961 season progressed the cheers were for The Mick the break the record and the jeers were for The Raj trying to break it. The pressures and the stress that was being placed on Roger Maris would take its toll on him physically and mentally.

The movie 61* does a pretty good job of recreating the events and telling the story behind what took place that season. The two actors who play Mantle and Maris bring a lot of believability to their rolls. It helps that they both look a lot like Mickey and Roger. A lot of attention was put into recreating the games being played on the field. They looked realistic enough you would think you were watching actual games. You have to give a lot of credit to the director for how well this movie is. The director happens to be Billy Crystal, a lifelong baseball and Yankee fan. It is easy to see this was a labor of love for Billy to make.

If you like baseball and watching movies then this is a baseball movie to watch. Believe me you will get caught up in the story and learn a lot about that year and the drama that two baseball players experienced during that summer.",1516838400,,2451,4.31236442516269

1624003,5,B00005M20M,"This movie is one of my favorites of all times. It shows that some people still loved playing baseball. Regardless if they are getting paid for what they do. Or weather they are people originated person. Or what records they are closed to breaking. Being in spotlight isn't always great. It can creative hate and threats. Just because you're not what the sport media wants as a role model cause of your down to earth shy personality. It also shows me The Greed, Coruption, and Abused of Power is more commonly found among by Officers,Writers,Owners and Commissioners in the Sport of Baseball. Instead of by the Men who plays it. Roger Maris was a good man. He didn't care about the fame he just went out and did what he loved and got paid to do play. He owned that record from day one after breaking Babe Ruth Previous record. But Commissioner of Baseball cheated him out of that honor until after his death. He was never giving the opportunity of knowing or enjoying that highlights of his life like Babe Ruth was.

Of course, by purchasing it in disk format, you get to hear all the behind the scenes comments from Billy Crystal, who did a MAGNIFICENT job putting this all together. The likenesses of these great actors to be able to portray M & M was most impressive. The movie captures the excitement, joy, sorrow frustration in all aspects not only in the main actors, but in the supporting actors, as well.

I enjoyed learning how they shot most of the movie's baseball action shots in the OLD Tiger Stadium, in Detroit! What a great job they did recreating old Yankee Stadium! There is some mention that the actor who played Mantle had never played a game of baseball in his life - but when you see him swing the bat - from both sides of the plate - down to the incredible mimic of Mantle's home run trot - it is truly amazing, the caliber of acting that went into this movie!!

I don't care much for the NY Yankees of the Steinbrenner era, but back in the day of M & M.... Berra, Ford, Richardson, Howard, Kubek.... etc - THESE were my boys!!!

I used to beg my mom to let me stay home from school when the Yankees were playing in the World Series.  Those were the days of the real heros in baseball.  This book is a great story about the two players and their struggle to break the Babe's homerun record.  It has humor and you see the personal side of them.  If you like baseball and the old Yankees, this is a good movie to watch.",1406073600,,475,4.0
1624129,5,B00005M20M,"Director Billy Crystal's 61* (2001) is partly the story of arguably the greatest year in New York Yankee history, 1961, when Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were chasing a ghost, Babe Ruth and his 1927 record of 60 home runs.

Even with a season extended by eight games and a league somewhat diluted by two expansion teams, it was doubtful either player would top the Bambino, especially if history was any indication.

In 1938 Hank Greenberg had a real chance to break Ruth's record, but for the last few weeks of the season pitchers stopped throwing him good stuff, and he finished with 58. Although Mantle was popular and didn't have the burden of prejudice against Hank's religion, the general consensus was that as he approached 60 round-trippers, the Mick would be victim of a steady stream of intentional walks.

As it turned out, a ""vitamin"" shot Mantle received from a doctor recommended by game announcer Mel Allen ate a silver dollar sized ulcer in his hip, and late in the season Mick was hospitalized. Roger carried on alone. The pressure was getting to him: clumps of his hair were falling out, he was sullen and withdrawn.

But we know how the story ends. On the last day of the season, Maris hit #61 at Yankee Stadium. Since he failed to do so within 154 games (as Ruth had), Commissioner Ford Frick, perhaps protective of Babe's memory, decreed that an asterisk would be placed in the official record book next to Roger's 61 home runs. Even with this minor blemish, it was one hell of an achievement.

In the film, Tom Jane is a believable Mantle, but Barry Pepper physically is Roger Maris incarnate. Several other actors nail their parts and Tiger Stadium makes a fine stand-in for ""the House that Ruth Built."" We're reminded here that center field in that park was so deep, there were several monuments near the warning track. I've never heard of any injuries from players running into those slabs of granite. Hell, up until the early 1950s, men just dropped their gloves at their positions when a half-inning ended. Even with these on-field obstacles there weren't a spate of balls bouncing off of, or fielders slipping on, abandoned gloves.

My only kick with a picture of exceptional accuracy is that it has Bob Cerv with the Yanks at season's beginning, when he was actually with the expansion L.A. Angels until mid-May.

Bottom line however, sports movie fans are sure to enjoy 61*.",1405036800,2,2405,4.739234449760765

1624132,4,B00005M20M,"If you can believe this there was a time before 24/7/365 ESPN all sports all the time when there were distinct seasons to sport and not so much overlapping. A time when, for example, the World Series in baseball was over before the chilly winds of November snow-delayed games in northern climes. A time when the national pastime was indeed the national pastime and life was, or seemed to be slower, slow enough to listen or watch a game for a couple of hours or occasionally go out to the ballpark and not put a big dent in your monthly discretionary budget. Hey, if you don't believe me just as your fathers, or ouch, grandfather they will tell you true.

And if you can believe this as well there actually was a time, maybe not the best time for players who were more like low-paid indentured servants to the master ball club owners, when pennant races meant something other than about six million playoff games and when the pursuit of legendary records captured the nations attention, or at least baseball nations attention. And no record was more sacrosanct than that of New York Yankee Babe Ruths record of hitting sixty taters (okay, okay home runs) out of the ballpark in the 1920s. That is until the year 1961 when as is detailed in the film under review, 61*, both Yankee players Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle went toe to toe to break that record.

Here is the fun part for me anyway. In the year 1961 when the then lowly Boston Red Sox were out of contention for the pennant by May 1st or so I avidly followed that home run derby, followed it closely. So all who think the only history I know is confined to the study of revolutions, or the lessons of history about war and other social evils have just had their comeuppance. As a fourteen year old boy I was gripped with the mania. Personally I was rooting for the Mick to win the battle but I was not displeased with Maris victory even if for silly reasons it was not done in the Ruthian 154 games and for many years he suffered the knowledge that an asterisk would appear after that record. Jesus.

Furthermore I would have been much more sympathetic to Maris struggle if I had known some of the details presented in this film about how the fans, hell, even Yankee fans, trashed Maris because they did not want to see Babes record fall or would rather have seen the Mick get it. The film shows Maris perseverance in the face of all those pressures from fans, from the parasitic sportswriters following the saga, and the effect it had on him personally and on his family. Moreover Mantle comes off here as a decent guy who was happy to let a teammate swing for the fences and for glory. Funny sports has changed a lot in the past fifty years since that feat (since broken several times in recent years although somewhat tarnished in the latter cases) but gnarly sport-writers and rabid fans (and here not  meaning devoted) are still with us.",1401580800,,2903,4.471698113207547
1624133,3,B00005M20M,"Only the slow patches keep me from giving this one four stars.  The film has many strengths and baseball fans will lap it up like catnip. Direction is crisp and faithful to the spirit of the story but the complaints that director Crystal takes liberties and is a tad self-indulgent are well taken.
My main reservation: like political and military biopics, to cite two not inapplicable sub-genres, sports movies are most successful when they stay with the subject matter and not veer off too much into the personal or philosophical. This is the weakness of 61* for me : it soared during the baseball scenes, dragged during the quieter, reflective moments. Director Crystal is to be commended for not whitewashing Mantles lifestyle, i.e. the drinking and more specifically womanizing, both of which are handled in honest if not sensationalist fashion here.
Comparisons are inevitable with the (relatively) recent, also reverential, baseball pic 42. To me 42 seems more like an art movie and top to bottom is the better film, as 61* is more for hardcore baseball fans. But the same reservations apply to both films in that they do better when they stay with sport and not so much personal/family issues.",1401494400,,1200,4.9405940594059405

1624146,5,B00005M20M,"Hello There, as a life long Red Sox fan I try to avoid anything that is beneficial to the NYY until I saw this. I always knew Maris had broken Babe Ruth's home run record and Mantle was a great switch hitter. That was before seeing this movie and afterword I was so impressed I started learning and researching both of them and the rest of that Yankee's age, so as an educated viewer I will write what I think about this movie.
  This movie is awesome and is in my opinion the best baseball movie to date. It is incredible how close Thomas Jane and Barry Pepper resemble Maris and Mantle. As the season of 1961 opens up the season has been lengthened from 154 games to 162. Once the season is underway Maris and Mantle are hitting an incredible amount of home runs and are on track to break Babe Ruth's home run record, and every one in America is taking a side, most people are in favor of Mantle, he is charming, handsome, and maybe the most famous player in the game.  As Maris pulls ahead of Mantle the baseball fans around the world dislike him and then hate him. He is portrayed as the bad guy. Maris is a straight shooter, blunt and un-eloquent in his speech, not very smooth in front of the camera, and with his crew cut and chiseled features, fans everywhere and especially in NY detest him. That is the on the surface image.
  Maris, to those who know him is a great teammate, a loving family man, give all ball player, honest to a fault, and a best friend to Mantle. While both played great on the field, off of it Mantle is a wild and irresponsible party boy, drinks to much, womanizes, and shuns must of his responsibility's as a father, but can be so likeable and friendly he is well supported by the press and country.
  The home run race goes into the last month of the season, everyone in the world is following it , even JFK from The Whitehouse made a reference to it in a speech. While Mantle is cheered everywhere, Roger gets booed in his own ballpark and even has a chair thrown at him. The stress gets to Roger, he starts loosing his hair and smoking 5 packs a day, he wants to quit and in a moving scene with the Yankees manager, breaks down but bravely continues on. Mantle is injured and all attention is now on Roger alone. In the last game of the season he breaks the record to a Stadium that is not even close to selling out.
  This is a great story, and also a very sad one, I felt so bad for Roger Maris, he was so genuine, such a real man, and a great role model. It is tragic that Maris at the time never got even close to the respect that he deserved, and this film gives to him the credit that he deserves.
  The film itself, the acting is great, special effects are surprisingly good, perfect cast, and the Proud and Historic Tiger Stadium is painted and changed into Yankee Stadium before its being destroyed. The music itself also enhances the movie.  There is also a 45 minute extra about the making of 61 that has a few  interviews with Mantle, Maris, and Billy Crystal who directed it.  This is so top notch it probably could have been released to movie theatres and was one step above an HBO movie.
  I was so influenced that this Red Sox Fan had to buy a large framed picture with Maris and Mantle holding a bat that is still on my wall. This is a must see for any baseball fan and if not a baseball fan, anyone who likes a great story.",1390003200,2,3378,4.213953488372093

1624180,4,B00005M20M,"I can recommend this movie without any regret for all adults that enjoy baseball, history, and drama. It contains all three in abundance! So why the asterisk? Please read to the bottom.

An HBO production made by Billy Crystal (a true baseball enthusiast), this instant classic has the insiders view of Roger Maris' duo battle for anonymity, while trying to beat the Babes homerun record and bring the Yanks a pennant. Of course, one goal compromises the other, but Roger wages the fight despite the recommendations of all, including Mickey Mantle, his eventual, close friend.

The storyline builds drama from the beginning. The viewer first sees Mark McGuire closing in on Roger Maris' homerun record, from the stand point of the Maris family. The sentiment builds, as Roger's widow is hospitalized as she and the family are enroute to St Louis to witness the record breaking moment. As she examines her husband's bat, on temporary loan from Cooperstown, she ponders 1961 and recalls her lover her husband. No need to go further describing the history.

This production is done with care and with tremendous concern to capture all aspects of perspective, through the tumultous homerun race of Maris, the reluctant hero, and Mantle, the heir to Yankee glory and legend. The actors look and capture their subjects incredibly. Yankee stadium is there in all its glory. No glossing over of the relationships and personalities are done to spare the reputations of Yankee legends. 61* is just true quality.

* So, here it is. As reported elsewhere in other reviews, I share disappointment with the graphic language used to develop the Mick's personality. The script goes beyond swearing, which I expected, to be honest. The references to sexual activity could have been toned down so kids could have enjoyed this great baseball movie.

Heroic quest by far too human players, very realistically and accurately portrayed. The featurette on how ""61*"" was filmed, directed and produced is a great foreward to the DVD movie itself. Billy Crystal created a special film and homage to Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, that will stand the test of time and entertainment to future generations and all fans of sports. Billy Crystal has made a film classic. I recall a fairly big argument over the type of baseballs used in Babe Ruth's time and the era of Mantle & Maris. Billy Crystal never introduced this aspect of the homerun race and the 'lively' baseballs of the 1960s compared to the argued 'deadened' baseballs in the earlier era of Babe Ruth. Mark McQuire's suspected 'juiced' shadows over his breaking of Maris' record isn't discussed, either.

It shows you some of what it was actually like to be these superstars, and how they dealt with the pressure put upon them by the public to be at the top of their game. The DVD version looks and sounds very good, and the price is unbeatable.",1329264000,3,473,4.325842696629214
1624199,4,B00005M20M,"As a former 10 year old (in 1961) this movie works as nostalgia and as a solid story - you do not have to love BB to enjoy this effort from beginning to end. It gets a giant boost from an rxcellent script (albeit replete with  anachronism) and cinematography perectly capturing ""'61"".

Another plus is in the Direction, really gutsy, in the respect that the female cast is not, shall we say, gender-corrected for the year 2000. As much as Crystal allows contemporary expressions in the dialogue, ostensibly for the younger fans' understanding, this film takes a chance in staying true to the period (with a young, handsome President, and the beginnings of social activism for women and minorities), portraying Mrs. Maris, living without Roger, even as a third child arrives, as a more supportive, understanding soul - the ultimate stay-at-home Mom, and SAH WIFE (as a ballplayer's spouse) before that situation needed to be explained. No sarcastic lecturing, as found in today's flicks and sitcoms. It works. No adjustments needed.

I can see, however, some concession to the ""sensitive male"", who worries and worries about his buddies feelings: it's true that Maris, still the new kid on the block at age 26, actually managed to take the 30 year old (arguably) King of Baseball at the time, and get him to...live right. With himself and teammate Bob Cerv, in a Queens, NY, 2-bedroom unit.

Two other handsome, telegenic, stars were Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, great athletes on a great team, which got the most media coverage of any team - and at a time when Baseball was on top.

I cannot give 5-stars for this outstanding movie because as someone who thinks of himself as educated on the subject (and having watched Maris hit his 52nd and 53rd homer that season at Yankee Stadium!), I can say that some major errors are committed.

One: I am confident in saying that the ""Chasing the Babe"" theme did not really kick in until about, say, early, June that season. The movie suggests to this Reviewer that ""61 in 61"" was one of the first things that popped into the sports writers' head in March.

Two: A big opportunity to give depth to the M & M *personal* relationship is lost, when not penetrating deeper into Mickey's psyche, regarding a traumatic event, actually a pvotal event in his career, in the previous season. Mantle was hitting his tape measure home runs at regular intervals, but he was in a prolonged slump, atually dating back to July of 1959. In mid-August, Mantle, in a funk, did not run out a ground ball because he thought he had made the third out. It was the second out. And baserunner Roger Maris had to put on his Football cap in breaking up the double-play. He was hurt. He missed alot of the season, as a result - and he ended with one *less* home run than Mickey, who led the league, with 40. I have to believe that Mick wanted Rog to get the glory he was robbed of in 1960! Mantle and Bob Cerv cheer on Roger from their hospital beds. A ""flashback"" to August 15th, 1960, would have increased the drama.

Three: It's a fact that the Sportswriters were not collectively in favor of Maris throughout the season. Where Mantle was the proverbial central casting idol, Maris was just a workin' man. He did have a classic sports story to tell but he was not exactly camera-savvy. These same writers awarded him his secondconsecutive MVP Award! And for the second year in a row, he beat out Mickey but just a handful of votes!

Fourth: The movie sgould have ended on one of the best freeze frames ever shot - RM just exhales in the clubhouse after..'61. An unnecessary scene with the boys reflecting on the season, on Life, closes out the proceedings.

The making of the movie Extra is a gem, with Billy Crystal, as tourguide to the extraordinary made-for-TV movie.

1624200,5,B00005M20M,"At first glance, you can tell that this isn't your average, run-of-the-mill sports biopic. It becomes quickly apparent that director/producer Billy Crystal has an emotional connection to the movie he is making. He cares about how Matle is portrayed. He cares about how Maris is portrayed. He cares about historical accuracy. He cares about recreating the atmosphere down to the excruciatingly finest detail. He just cares.

""61*"" is not just a sports movie, it is a history lesson in what used to make baseball great. Most of us were not alive to witness the 61 home run race in the summer of 1961 and this movie serves as our own personal newsreel fo the events. Billy Crystal went to great lengths to portray the 1961 season, a time in which he calls the greatest summer of his life, in the greatest detail. The actors hired to portray the players were chosen to not just for their acting skills, but for their resemblance to the players they were portraying as well. Barry Pepper is eerie as Roger Maris. The resemblance is uncanny and when he's turned at 3/4, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between him and the real Maris. Thomas Jane does an amazing job as the high-living Mickey Mantle whose self-destruction likely lead to him not being the player he ultimately could have been.

The movie does a great job of setting the mood and you quickly forget you are watching a movie as you begin to get sucked into the plot. It is a great story about a great time in America. A time when there was no war and America had one passion, baseball, and America's team, the Yankee's, were the stars of the show. America was glued to their tv's and radios trying to soak in every second of these games and Crystal's film is a Grand Slam, 400 foot Home Run over the centerfield wall.

The acting in this is excellent, and Thomas Jane and Berry Pepper even look so much like Mantle and Maris.  Billy Crystal did an amazing job on this movie, and his love of the game comes through loud and clear.  The movie goes into what went on behind the scenes, and the courage that both men showed.  Mantle was at the end of a brilliant career, and Maris was just coming into his own.  Mantle fit into the New York sports scene, while Maris had different values.  The struggles that both went through are caught with compassion and humor. Yes, this is a five star movie, and a must for any true baseball fan.

1624203,5,B00005M20M,"I officially fell in love with baseball in 1967, the year that Carl Yastrzemski was THE Red Sox.  Something about that World Series (with the Cardinals) sank in and after that I could not get enough of either the Red Sox or baseball in general.  But in our house, I was the only Red Sox fan, the folks were fans of New York baseball - especially the Yankees (no accounting for taste).  We had books in our home about Lou Gehrig and the Babe and I got the impression that my mom thought that Joe DiMaggio was pretty good looking.  My dad adored Mickey Mantle and I find it strange that not a word was said about Roger Maris until I was out of the house and read about him.  My father's memories of the Yankees didn't seem to contain any clear recollection of Roger Maris other than he was in competition with Mickey Mantle that year to beat the Babe's record.  This movie fills in a lot of that missing information.  While I am not a Yankees fan (sorry), I am a Roger Maris fan.  Mr. Crystal is to be commended for the work that went into this movie - especially his portrayal of the difficulties that Mr. Maris experienced because he did not fit the ""mold"" of a Yankee superstar. After I saw this movie, my curiosity then led me to Tom Clavin's ""Roger Maris"" a book about the life of this fine baseball player (and human being).  If you are curious about Roger Maris and his sojourn in New York, this book is a great place to start.  It is too bad that there is no place for Roger Maris in Cooperstown, even though his bat is there.  His lack of votes (overlooked, snubbed or just plain ignored) is just part of the price he paid to be his own man.  I admire him.  Oh and...bring back the Brooklyn Dodgers.  That was ""the New York"" team.",1322438400,,1737,4.240121580547113

1624205,5,B00005M20M,"61* is an HBO television movie which focuses on Roger Maris' pursuit of the single season home run record, and his friendship with Yankees teammate Mickey Mantle. Both Maris and Mantle competed for the record in 1961, and the narrative of the film provides insight into some of the pressures that both players faced on and off the field. The movie portrays these men as well intended, but sometimes making mistakes socially because of intense media attention, public scrutiny, and for Mantle he had a weakness towards a lifestyle of heavy drinking. Gaining an understanding of the lives of Maris and Mantle on and off the baseball field, during the 1961 season, is quite a bonus for the viewer to enjoy and to appreciate. It is a satisfying and revealing baseball story.

1624207,4,B00005M20M,"There've been many movies made about baseball, some of them great, some of them bad. But the one thing that makes the great ones worth watching are the ones that capture the feel of the game, the essence of the ball park and the love that fans have for their heroes. Comedian Billy Crystal turns director for the film *61, a tribute to the game he loved as a child and continues to love, especially the New York Yankees. Not only that, he tells the story of two men swept up in history whether they wanted to be or not: Mickey Mantle and Roger Marris.

The story opens with both men playing for the Yankees and the press wind up about whether or not Mickey will break the record set by Babe Ruth for home runs in one season. The controversy revolves around if it will count or not since the season is now longer than when the Babe played. Toss in a baseball commissioner who was a friend of Ruth's who actually wants the record to never be broken and it all gets a bit hinky.

The movie revolves around the two teammates and begins in a way that made me think here we go again. It depicts Mickey Mantle (Thomas Jane) as a womanizer and near alcoholic (which he was) and kind of dirties the shine for the hero many came to love in a world without the constant paparazzi. But it doesn't dwell on these facts, merely points them out and then moves forward.

At the same time Mantle is being touted by the press to break the record, new teammate Roger Marris (Barry Pepper) is doing well for himself. He needs a little polish but after being brought together with Mantle by the coach, both men seem to do better. So much so that the chance of the record being broken grows from not just one man breaking the record but two.

The story shows a developing friendship between these two men that gets battered at times by a press that wants to cause controversy when there is none. And Marris' refusal to play the game and not speak to the press that much just fuels their desire to take him down a notch. The thing is he's really the shy soft spoken guy he appears to be but they don't see that in him. And when they twist his words around to make it seem he doesn't appreciate New Yorkers his troubles only increase. Not only does he have the weight of the world on his shoulders as he tries to break the record, now he has an entire town less than thrilled with him. And all he wants is to do the best he can for his team.

The film moves in a smooth progression of the year both men were up to beat that record, showing them first as fellow teammates and eventually the best of friends. It shows them growing not just with the team but with each other. And it shows how the stress of all they were involved in took its toll on them as well.

But the thing that makes this movie work best is the love that was put into it. You can feel it. While warts and all are on display, the heart of the game is seen here as well. In a world where headlines talk about steroid use and all the sex scandals the press can dig up, it's nice to see a film that talks about a time when it was the game that was important. Not only that the film captures the innocence of the era from a fans perspective as well. You can tell that Crystal was captivated by his heroes and the whole world of baseball. As I watched this movie I realized that it took me back to the one major league game I went to, all the sights and sounds. I remembered buying the pennant that I had, taking home the miniature bat they handed out as a promotion, the smell of peanuts and popcorn as well as the guys walking down the aisles hawking these items, the hot dog with stadium only brown mustard (or so I thought at the time), the sound of the crack of the bat when it hit the ball, the deep green of the field...all of these memories came back while I watched. And all from one single pro game. Crystal catches all those feelings and emotions and bottles them up to pour out on the screen here.

The story of that fateful year when two men had the chance to beat the home run record makes for an entertaining and thrilling film. If you don't know the outcome then you'll sit waiting to see if they make it. If you do know, you'll enjoy taking that walk down memory lane to the great days of baseball when it was more about the game and less about the perks and salaries of the stars.

The new edition blu-ray looks fantastic. The colors and images are sharper, cleaner and brighter than ever. Included in the special items is a look at the making of the film which includes turning a stadium no where near New York into the house the Babe built. Even some of the players still alive when this was made who Crystal invited to the set were stunned how much it seemed like home. Fans of baseball deserve see this film, maybe even own it. And with this blu-ray edition, they'll get the best copy they can.",1313366400,,4856,4.180555555555555

It tells and relives an exceptional story in an exceptional way.  No item, however small, has been spared to make this the most realistic presentation on that great 1961 season, Maris, Mantle and the home run chase against Babe Ruth's ghost.

Billy Crystal is to be commended again and again for this balanced and realistic look at the chase and the men doing the chasing. Portrayals of Mantle and, especially, Maris are outstanding.  The actor playing Maris looks so much like the real Roger Maris, one sometimes has to do a doubletake to be sure it is the movie and not the real Maris.

No holds barred, no punches pulled in the foilbles of these two great Yankees, and, surprisingly to some, their enduring friendship amid the chase and the glare of the NY media. Truly well done.

And an added note: After watching 61*, be sure and watch the added story, ""The Making of 61*. It is almost as good as the movie...in some ways better because of its use of natural footage from the time.

There's one bad guy in all of this: Ford Frick. We knew it at the time and we really know it now.  Why did Frick, as Commissioner of Baseball, insist that the asterisk be added to the Maris record?  Because he was Babe Ruth's PR man in an earlier life, and did not want his friend and idol's most cherished record to fall.  Thus the asterisk.

Thank goodness a later commissioner, Faye Vincent, had the good sense and decency to remove the asterisk.

Good stuff here...Buy it, Watch it, and keep it...it's that good, a piece and time of baseball history that anyone who loves the game will enjoy, even Red Sox fans.  Yes, it is that good.",1307923200,,1819,4.509146341463414

We played baseball on the sandlot & fantasized that we were one of the Yankees as we hit, fielded & argued. Roger Maris was my idol. In the years long since, having pursued a career & raised a family, I was recently shocked to hear he is not in the HOF!!! This movie is so well done by Billy Crystal! Barry Pepper turns in an outstanding performance and the filming is spectacular. The storyline depicts the rabid press..bombastic in their assaults polarizing fans to all but destroy a humble, modest man, who once loved the game of baseball. They wrote flagrantly untrue stories & the Yankees failed to protect him. His tombstone reads: 61 in '61 Against all odds, and indeed it was! The movie tells it like it was...a womanizing, alcoholic Mantle contrasted to a devoted team player & family man - Maris. He cared so much for Mantle & rescued him by asking him to live w/ he & Bob Cerv...thus beginning the fabulous drive in '61...the mesmerizing pursuit of the HR record by both Mantle & Maris. Roger Maris was a 4x All Star, 2x MVP, HR record holder & should have won the MVP in '62, outplaying Mantle, but lost in a believed contrived ballot. Maris fought many injuries & was expected to play w/ a fractured hand & excruciating pain in '64 when Yankee Mgr Houk, refused to divulge the fracture to Maris until the end of the season after he had his own x-ray taken, revealing the fractured hand. He played on multiple pennant & WS teams, ultimately retiring w/ the Cardinals. His bat & ball are in the HOF & it is long overdue that the King receive his crown! See this movie. It is beautiful!

1624219,5,B00005M20M,"I grew up in the 60's loving the game of baseball and although I've been a life long Boston Red Sox fan, it was very difficult (if not impossible) to fall under the magical ""spell"" of names like Mantle and Maris.

And director Billy Crystal was able to capture that magic on film with this incredibly moving motion picture, which followed the exploits of the ""M & M boys"" as they both pursued the most elusive and prized goal in all of professional sports - Babe Ruth's 1927 record season 60 home runs.

But this is far more than just a baseball movie. It's a film about an incredibly decent, humble and modest man, who had to endure a hellish 1961 season from the NY fans, the NY media and even the baseball commissioner's office. It's about the incredible friendship and bond that existed between both Maris and Mantle. But in my opinion, it's a movie about a wonderful husband and family, who left us far too early (Roger died at the age of just 51 years old).

I can't come up with enough accolades for the performances of the two leads, Thomas Jane (Mantle) and Barry Pepper (Maris) and the incomparbale supporting cast, who played the other Yankees and press. And the attention to detail that director Billy Crystal conjured up in taking us all back to 1961 is breathtaking.

There are some magnificent baseball movies in circulation (i.e. Field of Dreams), but 61* easily stands along side them and is a must-own film for any baseball fan's library.

This is a love letter from Billy Crystal to his boyhood heros and the Cathedral that we called (old) Yankee Stadium. But I think I'll be eternally grateful to Billy for showing us all what a hero / role model that this quiet and unassuming man (Maris) was and how he maintained his dignity and self-respect despite being crucified by the NY media / fans. It was shameful the way Roger Maris was treated and why this great ball player isn't in the Hall of Fame is absolutley baffling.

Thanks, Billy. Although my allegiance with always be with the Red Sox, I'm grateful for this incredibly poignant and heartwarming story you gave us.

Rest in peace, Roger.",1291334400,5,2114,4.591511936339523
1624220,4,B00005M20M,"This is the rare baseball movie that gets its facts right and has excellent casting, directing and writing.  The 1961 season is shown as much as the race to break Babe Ruth's home run record.  I also like the fact that this is not simply a Maris vs.  Mantle movie.  Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane are perfect in their respective roles of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle.  The baseball footage is well done and the inner dynamics of the New York and world media, rooting for Mantle to break the record, is well played.

The one downside, or strike if you prefer, is that the movie is too reverential about the Yankees.  They are seen as a fun and lively crew but no where near the hard partying animals they were.  Keep in mind that bar room brawls were nothing for them.  The use of profanity is often used by Crystal but I think that's more of a nod to current tastes than the times. I am sure if he could have gotten away with it, we would have heard nothing worse than a heck or hell.

All in all a good baseball movie.  The part with Mark McGwire is just pathetic now that we know what a cheat he was. But still it's fun to watch.",1285459200,,1130,4.161290322580645

I was 12 years old back when the Maris/Mantle home run battle took place, and baseball was my life.  My neighborhood buddies and I played ball every day that the weather allowed.  This movie took me back in time to re-live my love of the game and how us youngsters used to entertain themselves in moral, athletic ways.  Life seemed much simpler then.  And our heros like Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were just regular people with tenacity and highly developed skills that came from years of practice.  No drugs or artificial enhancements were involved.  These guys didn't play ball just for the money either; they actually loved the game too.  I don't think the movie makers could have picked better actors to play the roles either.

1624228,5,B00005M20M,"Whether you loved baseball or not, the summer of '61 was dominated by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, and Billy Crystal has perfectly captured the 'feel' of that unforgettable, magical season in ""61*"". When 'M & M' began their assault on Babe Ruth's 'unbreakable' record of 60 home runs in a single season, those who knew and loved the Babe were angered that this 'Holy Grail' was a target, and, as Crystal illustrates, Ruth's friend, Baseball Commissioiner Ford Frick, laid down restrictive rules to help keep Ruth's record intact (the dreaded asterix, if the record wasn't broken in 154 games), making the competition more than simply breaking the record, but a race against the clock, as well.

With two brilliant performances by actors Thomas Jane and Barry Pepper (who look astonishingly close to Mantle and Maris), the film transcends the sport, becoming a tale of friendship, of an insane loss of privacy and personal dignity, and of two very different, remarkable men. Mantle is universally loved (and expected to win the race), a veteran Yankee of epic talent and overwhelming charm, whose wild boozing and womanizing is 'sanitized' by an adoring press. Maris, on the other hand, is a quiet, focused professional, a family man whose only vice is cigarettes, and, in only his second year with the Yankees, is considered an outsider and usurper to Mantle's 'glory' (having won the MVP award, the year before). As he has little to say to the press, they make a spectacle of him, in a season-long vendetta that fans the flames of hatred that the city already feels towards him. For Maris, the impact is staggering, added to the pressure of the home run race. Welts appear on his body and he starts losing handfuls of hair, he receives daily hate mail, and even his family is threatened. But Maris' biggest ally is Mantle, who truly likes him, admires his devotion to his family and the game, and realizes his own failing body may not allow him the triumph his fans expect.

It is a beautiful story, riveting despite the fact that the outcome is known, before the film even begins.

I highly recommend the 'Making of' documentary, as well as the film. Did you know Thomas Jane had never played any baseball, before he made the film? And Crystal's decision to include a cameo by Mantle's tiny grandson, watching the 'grandpa' he'll never know hit a home hun, is sheer magic!

""61*"" is simply a fabulous film, at a really fabulous price. Even if you don't like baseball, I think you'll love this film!",1256169600,3,2502,4.771362586605081

1624233,5,B00005M20M,"61* is the true story of one of baseball's finest moments, the race for Babe's homerun record. Back then baseball was America's favorite past time and America's favorite sport. People absolutely loved the game. And if you were a Yankee fan it was even better. When Babe set the record for 60 homeruns it was in 1927 and he was a Yankee. Well skip ahead 34 years later to 1961, and the two stars hammering for the record just happen to both play for the Yankees. Roger Maris (Barry Pepper) and Mickey Mantle (Thomas Jane), two of the big hitter for the Yankees.

Mickey is adored by the fans. He's got the charming good lucks and the play boy attitude. Roger is liked, but not like Mickey. He's a family man, but he's got the personality of a tree when it comes to talking to reporters and looking good for the on field cameras. Mickey has been with the Yanks for around 10 years now, while Roger was brought over from Kansas City a year ago. So of course the fans are going to have their favorites. But as the race gets farther along, the favoritism gets out of hand and really becomes hatred. Death threats, kidnapping his kids threats, on-the-field abuse from fans, reporters lying about things he said and does. It was really crazy to see these events happen.

And Roger didn't deserve it. From the beginning we see how great Roger is and how good of a friend he is. We see that Roger and Mickey are really good friends and even become better friends as the year goes on. Roger just loves the game of baseball and really wants to win the series, but he knows they can't do it without Mickey. The thing is Mickey lives up to his playboy antics and is constantly abusing his body with alcohol and women. He comes home at any time of the hour, drunk as a skunk, and then has to wake up to play ball with an enormous hang over. Roger, being the friend he is, asks Mickey to move in with him and Bob Cerv (another player) at their NY `home' to hopefully get Mickey to straighten up his act. When Mickey agrees, you can see the improvement in not just his game but also Rogers game. And so the race begins between two amazing players and amazing friends.

I really liked this movie and consider it one of my favorite sports movies ever. What makes it even better is that it's a true story. It really was a lot of fun to witness the interactions of these two iconic legends. To see the joy of the game with these two, but also the pressure it brought. It was a lot of fun to watch each of them root for each other and try to make the other one better than themselves, even though the press was telling the fans they were arguing and hating each other. There is so much I could say about this movie, but I really think I would just bore you because I would type out the whole darn movie if I could.

There are only two things I didn't like about the movie. One is a scene where Roger Maris breaks down from the pressure and begins to cry a little. It just felt weird and the music didn't help. And the other thing is, is that there is a good amount of cussing thrown around, especially the F bomb. It doesn't bother me at all, and make the movie feel even more real to me, but I know how some people and some parents are about cussing. So just be warned if you are that type of person. It's not used to much, and it's used in places you'd expect, but I'm just letting you know.

In the end, if you are a lover of good sports movies, baseball movies, true life movies, or even dramas, then definitely own this movie. This is what baseball is all about. Not what we have nowadays on T.V.

1624247,4,B00005M20M,"This movie is well-done.  They paid attention to details.  Billy Crystal is a fan who remembers this era fondly and did a great job telling the very interesting story of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.  These are names I remember from growing up, but I knew little about.  Having the two men on the Yankees at the same time, each aiming to beat the home run record Babe Ruth had set as a Yankee, makes for a fascinating story.

The only problem with the movie is the language is foul (so to speak).  The swearing and use of various words is way over the top and distracts from the story.  It should have been made as a family movie because the appeal of this story crosses all generational lines.  If it weren't for the language, this movie would deserve even more than five stars.

The special features are very worth watching.  They show just how much detail they put into every aspect of this movie--from the color of the stadium, to the swings of the two players.

If the language won't bother you, I highly recommend this movie.  If it had a rating, it most certainly would be rated ""R"", so keep that in mind when considering showing it to children.",1194739200,,1153,4.412322274881516
1624248,5,B00005M20M,"This terrific film by Billy Crystal highlights the 1961 chase for the HR record between Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.  Both players were trying to surpass Babe Ruth's single season home run record of 60, and the battle lasted for most of the season until Mantle got hurt.  The only drama was then whether Maris was going to do it or not.  I'm sure if you are reading this, you already know how it ends!  There are several subplots to this tale, however.  Mantle was the darling of the NY fans, and Maris was never popular.  The fans and the media didn't want the Babe's record to be broken, but if it was going to be broken, everyone wanted Mantle to do it, not Maris.  A secondary subplot (related to the title of the film) describes how, when Maris broke the record, the HR title was entered into the record book with an asterisk, denoting that Maris's 61 HRs were obtained in a 162 game season.  The seasons were only 154 games in the Babe's time.  Maris never received in his lifetime the credit that was due him for this monumental achievement, and I think Crystal wanted to relive his youth through this film and right a wrong.

This is a great film, even if you aren't a baseball fan or a Yankees fan (OK, I admit it, I'm part of Red Sox nation!).  The story is well acted, the choice of Pepper and Jane to play Maris and Mantle was outstanding.  The vignette at the end is particularly touching.  Crystal shows actual footage of Mark McGwire breaking Maris's record in the late 90s, then going to talk with Maris's widow and family in the stands.  There are a great number of historical inaccuracies in the film, particularly the portrayal of Mantle.  This is Billy Crystal's image of Mantle through a boy's eyes, more of how Mantle should have been, not what he was.  This is a minor quibble though.  If you don't appreciate this film, you aren't an American and don't understand a thing about the United States.",1193529600,,1922,4.461318051575931

It shows Mickey Mantle's and Roger Maris's life in detail during the 1961 season. Their highs and lows and how they lived together and got along. I highly recommend this for the whole family. It is far cleaner than many sports movies. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane do a remarkable job portraying Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle .

1624250,5,B00005M20M,"It really is a great film! I'm so glad that I came accross it because it was a complete accident.  I'd never heard anything about the film before, and knowing that sports movies could be really good or really awful, I was hesitant to pick this up.  But being a lifelong baseball fan and being that it was only $6, I decided right before I walked out the door at MovieStop to turn back and buy it.

Anybody who watches the Yankees on TV knows that Billy Crystal is a familiar face at the Stadium, whether it's April or October, and bringing what was certainly the most cherished baseball season of his youth to life, albiet not on the big screen, has to have been a huge thrill for him.  He did a wonderful job of it too.

Although I was not alive at the time, the setting seems to be a flawless throwback to the early 60's, right down to the appearence of Yankee Stadium before its renovations in the mid 70's.  I was actually suprised to learn that it was filmed in Tiger Stadium, because Crystal and his entire crew had made it come alive with the true aura of the Bronx. The acting in the film is superb and throughout I couldn't get over how similar Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane looked to Maris and Mantle.

 The film really brings to light what Roger Maris had to go through, being the soft-spoken guy who the press often considered surly (sound familiar?), he was far from the fan favorite in the Bronx, even though he was clearly their most dangerous hitter that year and one of the key features in that championship season.  It is just a crime that it took more than 30 years after the record was broken for it to be officially recognized as baseball single-season home run record (Babe Ruth had hit 60 in a 154 game season, while Maris only had 59 at that point), and that Maris was not alive to see it.

I would highly reccomend 61*, even to Red Sox fans.

The bonus area on the DVD is exceptional, with commentary from Crystal and all kinds of behind the scenes stuff about the making of the movie and who and what went into its production.",1188086400,,2051,4.301298701298701

1624252,4,B00005M20M,"I wasn't alive during the chase.  Wasn't born until 20 years later.  However my father was and his father as well.  From what they tell me, it was a great time for baseball.  It was a great time to be a baseball fan.  Little did I know that in the summer of '98, I'd be going through a chase of my own.  Yes, it was a great moment for baseball, and yes it was great to be a fan.

However, as we all now know, the most respected record in all of baseball was tainted soon after by allegations and denials and by the sheer un-believability that 61 and eventually 70 would fall.  As baseball fans we went through enormous highs to then go through an enormous low.  Some of us are still stuck down there actually.

So a couple of fans of my father's generation decided to come out with a true story of baseball glory.  A real chase of monumental proportions was made available to us in the movie, 61.  Some of us younger fans were glad we got to see records being broken, but now the majority of us feel cheated.  We didn't get to see records being broken.  We got to see records being stolen.  So what do we have to look back to?  What can we say was the greatest moment in baseball history while we were alive?  Right now, I can't think of any.  This is why I appreciate the efforts of this movie to tell the true-life story of the real chase between Mantle and Maris for Ruth's record.  While I was never ther to witness it for myself, I can certainly paint a picture now thanks to Billy Crystal and to the actors involved.

I don't think I can rate this movie based on performances, but I can rate this movie based on facts and what is real.  Something whole and pure was brought back to us some 40 years later to remind us of how pure the game used to be.  This film is not the greatest film ever made, but if you're a generational baseball fan, this movie stands right next to the likes of Field of Dreams and others who were true to the sport of baseball.",1173139200,3,1958,4.124338624338624

1624256,5,B00005M20M,"Most films that try to capture the significance of a sporting event from a by-gone era suffer because they fail to attach it to any historical context. Upon first view, I thought that ""61*"" was somewhat guilty of that. It was an unfair opinion because at that time I had just finished watching ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Miracle"", both of which are slightly superior films. Now, however, I've had a change of mind after a second viewing. Billy Crystal has done an enormous job in capturing the M&M boys of 1961.

Crystal has all the bases covered (bad pun intended). He covers Maris' can-do spirit as he approaches the Babe's single-season home run mark. However, Crystal also covers the hostility this drew from the press and the fans. Barry Pepper does a great job conveying Maris' quiet suffering that the anger spawned. Meanwhile, Maris' friend, the beloved Mickey Mantle is also nearing Ruth's record, but doesn't generate such animosity. Off the field, however, Crystal shows us Mantle making that changeover from a fun-loving young man to an almost self-destructing adult. Around these two men, the press--specifically the voracious New York press--circles like vultures.

The side characters are fairly well-rounded and well-portrayed: specifically, Anthony Michael Hall as Whitey Ford.

Crystal's fondness for the era is evident in every scene. Fortunately, he doesn't wax too nostalgic. Instead, he gives us an honest view of a time when baseball was barely clinging to its innocence, and of a man who did not deserve the hostility and the asterisk that haunted him.",1150848000,6,1567,5.11328125

1624258,5,B00005M20M,"In the pantheon of baseball movies, this one, 61*, is in my personal top five, and perhaps the top three.  Billy Crystal, better known as a comedian or as host of the Academy Awards, took the director's chair for this film, and produced a story that was a grand insight into the personal and professional world of baseball during the era of Mantle and Maris.  Produced very shortly after Mark McGwire broke the Maris record, Crystal framed the 1961 story with scenes from the McGwire run.

Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in the 1927 season, and Yankee stadium was still known, a generation later, as the house that Ruth built.  In 1961, Ruth's longstanding record seemed secure.  Mickey Mantle had inherited the status of 'Yankee favourite' from predecessors Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth, but Roger Maris had narrowly beat him in the poll for MVP the previous year, all the more remarkable because Maris was a newcomer from the midwest.  The sportwriters were divided in how they reported about the team, but almost all were more focussed upon Mantle until the runs began to stack up.  However, the press (and often, it seemed, the fans) were still favouring Mantle, and sometimes booed Maris when he would hit a home run.

Crystal did a good job at showing the kind of personal stresses, both family and professional, that Mantle and Maris had to endure going through what should have been one of the most glorious seasons in baseball history.  There was a kind of institutional resistance to anyone breaking Ruth's record, but even more resistance to Maris than to Mantle.  This is embodied in the asterisk that followed the number 61 in record books (and the title of this film) - Ruth's season was several games shorter, and it was deemed 'unfair' for Maris to take the record, having not hit the same number of runs in the same number of games.  Eventually the asterisk would be removed, but not before Maris' death some time later.

Good little touches like Maris' special eggs (which Mantle began to eat with reluctance, but came around when Maris said he hit home runs after eating them), scrap book collections shown periodically throughout the film, the song 'I love Mickey', and other audio-visual pieces of baseball memorabilia make this a baseball trivia-buff treat.  The personal stories of the family lives, increasingly under stress as both players come within striking distance of the record, show details most likely fictional, but certainly understandable.

Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane star as Maris and Mantle, respectively, and both turn in great performances as the athletes.  They both look like naturals on the field and in the locker room, and do a good job with the personal angle as well, Pepper playing the low-key Maris and Jane playing the hard-living Mantle.  They both bear striking resemblance to the men they portray, Pepper especially so.  Other performers include Anthony Michael Hall, Richard Masur, and Christopher McDonald in memorable supporting roles.  Donald Moffat as the commissioner Frick is especially good.  Jennifer Foley (actually, Jennifer Crystal Foley, Billy Crystal's daughter) turns in a good performance as Pat Maris, the long-suffering and supportive wife, struggling from half a country away to be strong for her husband as he faces the stress of success.

Any baseball fan will love this film.  Those who aren't necessarily fans of baseball may find a new-found passion for the game.

For those of us fortunate enough to remember this 1961 season it brought back a lot of memories.  I do want to make note of two things in particular that caught my eye, one good and one bad.  The person who played the part of Hoyt Wilhelm when he came in to pitch to Maris had the same mannerism as Wilhelm in the way he tilted his head.  The movie also showed a ""fan"" throwing a chair in then Briggs Stadium in Detroit at Maris in right field.  This incident did NOT take place in 1961.  It took place in 1960 when Yankee first baseman Bill Skowron hit a disputed home run in the right field stands that Tiger fans thought to be foul.  When the Yankees took the field in their half of the inning (7th or 8th) someone in the upper deck in right field threw the back of a chair at Maris.  I know this to be true.

such affection for baseball as came over me while watching *61.

As far as I'm concerned, from now on Billy Crystal is bulletproof.

No one could possibly have done a better job with this subject.  No one.

His attention to historical detail and his integrity, insight and feel for all the real stuff, the human stuff that make this such a terrific, inspiring American story simply puts most other filmmakers who have attempted fact-based period pieces to shame. Sports or otherwise, they rarely display this

much respect and devotion to a story's heart and soul.

Watching *61 was like taking a time machine back to a part of my youth that I had almost entirely forgotten about. I too lived for Mickey Mantle's triumph.  So this movie gave me the chance, in some small way, to repent for my unfair disdain and disregard for the truly heroic Roger Maris. It is a fitting memorial to a splendid athlete, and a decent guy.

Thomas Jane as Mantle is great and shows the demons that caused Mantle to be who he was during his playing days.

Every ounce of your passion, your knowledge...your love...of baseball, the Yanks, Mickey and the glorious summer of 1961 is up on the screen in your impossibly good movie, ""61*"".

It's obvious you were there for all this stuff...you've made a movie that only you could have made, and how many times can you say that? What filmmaker...ever...would not only have the talent to pull off this story, but also witnessed it as it happened?

Nobody. But you.

This is a film that belonged on the big screen, not the small. The reconstruction of the U.S. back in 1961 feels pitch-perfect; even though I was technically a negative-three years old at the time, it feels 'right.' Even though I missed it, being pre-embryonic and all that, I ""got"" Mantle's appeal, Maris' torture, the press' pressure.

Your direction varied from the emotionally operatic to the documentary-like, yet fit each scene like a glove. Intertwining scenes from the stands, the field, the broadcast booth and elsewhere exquisitely enhanced the drama without attracting too much attention to itself. I liked it when you just sort of let the events unfold. Yes, I know that a simple groundball-to-short must have involved 30 shots and five days of work, but it seemed as if it was happening ""real time.""

On the other hand, some of those great overhead or ""in the air"" shots, usually of some massive home run, conveyed the drama and the excitement in a way only film can.

Your casting was phenomenal. As the other reviewers have mentioned over and over again, Thomas Jane and Barry Pepper were perfect. Perfect beyond belief. But I found the other characters equally fine...Mel Allen, Ralph Houk, Phil Rizzuto were all played by character actors easily recognizable to anyone who has seen more than a dozen movies in their lifetime, yet they evaporated into their character. Your daughter put in a sublime performance herself...sweet enough that I sought her name out at the end of the film, only to find out who she ""really"" was!

An intelligent, perceptive script combined with some seriously impressive cinematography and again, masterful art direction (in recreating 1961), made for a film package better than the majority of ""movie theater"" films that came out that year, or any year.

This is a film that every baseball fan will adore, every film fan will love, and every casual fan will thoroughly enjoy. It's a terrific movie. Thank you so much, Mr. Crystal, and I urge you to make more baseball movies...please!

This is a very interesting true story about the 1961 season when the MandM boys were racing to beat the Babe's homerun record.  Not only that, but you see what pressure Roger was under from angry fans and what the higher ups in baseball thought of someone breaking Ruth's record.

This story is emotional too.  The opening scenes of modern day McGuire getting ready to break Maris' record and then the record breaking homerun at the end of the movie was really something.  If you ever have rooted for the little guy, you will love this movie.  After seeing this, I wondered to myself...WHY ISN'T MARIS IN THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME?

Roger Maris, newly acquired from Kansas City, has to compete with the people of New York's love affair with the gone but not forgotten Babe Ruth and the larger than life Mickey Mantle, while powering his way toward the homerun record - - with the New York fans booing him along the way and the Commissioner of Baseball determined that he not succeed.  61* deals with not only the action on the field (which is exciting to watch) but also with the tension and stress that Maris and Mantle both suffer off the field.  The performances in this film are absolute perfection.  I will admit that I am a Barry Pepper fan and cannot think of a bad performance he has turned in, but you would think he was born to play the part of Roger Maris.  Pepper conveys in his facial expressions alone, the stress, the anger, the sadness he feels, and the love for his family.

Yeah, the title is 61*, so the ending is palpable, right? DUH! But Billy Crystal goes a lot deeper than that. He goes into the heart of what the Yankees were back than. It is shown how Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle were best buddies back then, and before this period in time, Billy Martin was among Mickey and Whitey ALL the time. It showed how cruel fans were to Roger Maris and how they really didn't want him breaking The Babe's record. In short, a lot of people thought Maris was a prick.

Crystal goes far enough to show the honesty about Mantle and Maris. He shows the deliberate, somewhat condescending nature of baseball commissioner Ford Frick. Not too many people liked him back then.

This is Billy Crystal's love letter to the 1961 Yankees, and to his credit it doesn't blink or flinch in its treatment of that greatest of childhood heroes, Mickey Mantle.

 In 1961 Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle took aim at Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a season.  Barry Pepper plays the young and reclusive Maris with a haunting sadness, Thomas Jane plays the charismatic Mantle with an easy going honesty that masks an emotionally and physically injured young man.  Pepper is a dead-ringer for Maris, and both actors get under the skin of the characters they're portraying.  There are times when you forget they're not really Maris and Mantle.  Couple their performances with 61*'s meticulous attention to detail and you've got a baseball fan's dream movie.

1624278,5,B00005M20M,"Billy Crystal grew up during that time, as he tells us in the informative documentary that accompanies his fine film. He KNOWS what Yankee stadium looked like. He knows every bit of trivia about all the Yankees - their batting stances, their body language, even the way they stood in the on-deck circle.

  As we discovered with McGwire and Sosa, then Barry Bonds, some of the most cherished records in any American sport are the Home Run records. We dig the long ball.

  It's difficult for someone like me who was not born yet to completely imagine what it must have been like to have TWO awesome home run hitters on the SAME team bearing down on that record - and to make it even better, the record was held by Babe Ruth, who was ALSO from the same team. The Yankees, love 'em or hate 'em (I'm a National League Fan, myself) are the most legendary team in baseball, and this year was one of their most legendary.

  That forms the setting for this truly entertaining story. Mickey Mantle had the movie-star aura and Roger Maris was a quiet family man from the midwest. EVERYONE was pulling for Mickey to break the record. Hardly anyone outside his own family was pulling for Roger.

  It was interesting to me to see in the film just how close Mantle and Maris were in real life, and the movie argues that they probably both had a positive effect on one another. Certainly the film hints that Roger's decency as a man influenced Mickey to concentrate a little more on the game and less on drinking and womanizing. At the same time the movie shows us that as the pressure of approaching the record began bearing down on Maris, he had no bigger supporter than Mickey Mantle.

  Barry Pepper looks so much like Roger Maris that you can hardly tell the difference between the two in the documentary accompanying. Thomas Jane also has an uncanny resemblance to Mantle and they both obviously studied the newsreel footage for hours because everything from their posture to their home run swings is a faithful duplication. Baseball movies in the past have often showed actors taking a weak swing with a cut to a ball flying majestically out of the park. Billy Crystal must have used some fantastic CGI imagery to produce shots where you see Mantle and Maris take their swing and without moving the camera, follow the ball arcing up into the upper deck of Yankee stadium.

You'll want to cheer Maris on in hopes that he'll break the Babe's record in time for his home run talley to be the ""official"" record(not the one with an asterisk).  This isn't one of those giant vs. the underdog type movies, it's a giant vs. a giant, albeit one of them is a gentle giant in a game that has always had its share of outlandish stars.  Mr. Crystal does not disgrace either of the heroes in this film.  If you loved Mantle before this film, you'll have no ill feelings toward him afterward.  As for Maris, Pepper's portrayal of him will make you want to cherish Roger even more.

""61*"" is probably one of the best baseball movies I have ever seen.  I would have never imagined that Billy Crystal would have ever been able to put together such a great film.
The cast in this movie is wonderful.  Roger Maris, played by Barry Pepper, who was also in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Green Mile,"" was played very well.  I can't comment on accuracy of the actual character as I was not alive when this story took place.  But, the roles were very believable.  The struggle that Roger Maris went through as a result of the media blitz that surrounded him and the ghost of Babe Ruth, must have been so painful.
Now, I don't claim to be a baseball expert, nor would I say that I am actually a fan of the game in the state it is in today. But, this film was when baseball was a game and people still played for the love of the game.  Yes, there were rich ballplayers, but many still had winter jobs and needed playoff bonuses to stay afloat.  They had a head for the game and they had heart for the game, now most have a head for the game and a heart for real estate.
This movie is wonderful.  If I was a producer, I would defiantly give Billy Crystal money for a movie. . . I do know that Mr. Crystal is a fan of the game. So, I do wonder slightly if the movie is accurate or if it a fan piece. . . But, honestly, I do not care.  The story was amazing.

1624291,5,B00005M20M,"I hope this doesn't sound insulting, but I never knew Billy Crystal could have directed a film as good as this one.
""61*"" recounts one of the most amazing years in baseball history - 1961, when two of the Yankees' most legendary sluggers, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, went on a hitting streak that took them within striking distance of Babe Ruth's celebrated (and seemingly unreachable) single-season total of 60 home runs.  But as the season progressed, and Maris and Mantle kept smacking them out of the park, two things became clear - 1), the baseball commissioner didn't want to see the record broken, and would do everything in his power to ensure it wouldn't be, and 2), fans and sportswriters had a definite preference when it came to which of the two they considered worthy of making baseball history (the overwhelming majority favored Mantle).  Still, the home runs kept coming - but so did the pressure, and the animosity, and the injuries, and the death threats.  And though the season proved historic, the toll on both players was enormous.
A film like ""61*"" needs to be perfectly cast in order to succeed, and this is where Crystal really scores - Barry Pepper captures all the drive, intensity, and quiet dignity of Roger Maris, while Thomas Jane nearly steals the film with an effortlessly charismatic (and all-too-human) Mickey Mantle.  In fact, all of the cast does admirable work - Bruce McGill makes a memorable Ralph Houk, and former teen star Anthony Michael Hall graduates to the big leagues with an expert turn as Whitey Ford.  If there's a problem at all, it's with the characters of the sportswriters, who become an increasingly intrusive and irritating presence as the film goes along (this, however, may be calculated - there's evidence to support both Maris and Mantle viewed a number of sportswriters as intrusive and irritating).
Ultimately, credit for the success of ""61*"" must go to Billy Crystal, whose filmaking instincts and attention to detail are truly admirable.  I should have known all along he was the only director who could do this story justice.",1037059200,3,2091,4.909348441926346
1624292,4,B00005M20M,"""61*"" is the true story of two baseball players, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, who spent the 1961 season chasing Babe Ruth's mythical single-season record of 60 home runs.  It tracks the well-known facts surrounding the race such as the way the press openly rooted for Mantle, and how the pressure appeared to get to Maris to the point that his hair was falling out late in the season.
The best part of the movie, however, is how it presents the off-the-field lives of the players.  Mantle is shown to be an out-of-control boozer and womanizer, but still manages to come off sympathetically.  (After all though, the movie was directed by Billy Crystal, who grew up idolizing Mantle.  Kudos to him for not shying away from the weaknesses of his hero.)  Mantle roots for Maris to break the record and seems genuinely friendly and caring, despite his neglect of his family.
Maris, on the other hand, is portrayed as a staid but saintly slugger.  He lives clean and cares for his family, but his boring earnestness and lack of outward emotion make him the enemy of the newsmen hungry for a story, who prefer the quotable Mantle, warts and all.
One of my only complaints is that Maris is shown as being almost too perfect.  I never knew the man and I'm sure he wasn't the carouser that Mantle was, but it strains believeability that a huge star for the Yankees would be so down-to-earth and pure and honest, his only portrayed fault being an inability to engage in back-slapping cameraderie with the hypocritical beat writers.  I might just be too cynical about such things, but the feeling I got was that ""61*"" broke a barrier by displaying Mantle's exhuberant abuse of himself but whitewashed any dirt on Maris.
The other minor thing that disappointed me is that there weren't more cameos from actual players in the movie.  As far as I know, the only one was from knuckleball pitcher Tom Candiotti, who played knuckleballer-of-that-era Hoyt Wilhelm.  Not sure it would have made the movie better, but I would have gotten a kick out of seeing real ballplayers in bit parts and scenes from ball games.
On the whole though, ""61*"" was a fun movie to watch, with some nice period detail and good performances from the two leads.  Definitely recommended for any fan of baseball and its history.",1034035200,2,2286,4.704260651629073
1624293,5,B00005M20M,"I'm too young to remember the ""Race for Ruth's Record"".  I read about it as a kid when I used to consume baseball books like they were water.  I always wondered what it must have been like being Roger Maris, a man who was truly under-appreciated in his time.  In the year 1961, Maris broke the single season homerun record set by Babe Ruth.  Babe hit 60, Roger hit 61 on the last game of the 1961 season.  Yet, due to Baseball Comissioner Frick's controversial ruling, Roger Maris' homerun record came with an asterisk - Maris' single season was longer than Ruth's.  It took another ""Race for the Record"" for people to realize just how much Maris struggled to beat the odds and break the record.  When McGwire beat the record in 1988, the season was longer, he was in better shape than Ruth and Maris, bats and balls were different, stadiums were different.  What else was different?  This time, nobody dared to bring up the dreaded asterisk!
61* begins on Opening Day at Yankees Stadium.  The team has a new manager, Roger Maris is to be awarded the Most Valuable Player Award, and Mickey Mantle is made team captain.  Reporters speculate on how members of the team will do this season.  But none of them could have imagined a season like that of 1961.  A season when two of the team's stars - relative newcomer, Roger Maris, and ailing veteran, Mickey Mantle - began a pace that could possibly cause the most sacred record in baseball to be broken.  Nobody ever believed that Babe Ruth's 60-homerun record would ever be beaten, not even Maris and Mantle.  But as the season progressed, it became clear to all that it was definitely a possibility.  As the race heated up, reporters began to hound Maris, an unpopular player with the fans due to his quiet and private nature.  Fans ridiculed him, booing every homerun he hit.  Meanwhile, it seemed that everyone rooted fan-favorite Mickey Mantle on.  Fans and reporters were merciless when it became clear that Mantle was not going to make it and Maris was on his way to breaking the record.  In fact, it's a wonder that Maris didn't have a nervous breakdown before he hit the fateful 61st.
This is a story of one man's struggle to do his best in a job that he truly loved.  He wasn't looking to please anyone - only to be able to look at himself in the mirror and say, ""I did what I could to get the job done.""  Roger Maris played the game well, not just because he was talented, but because he loved it.  It's a shame that the asterisk was not removed from his homerun record until 6 years after his death.  This movie also revealed a true friendship that stood the test of the stress it was placed under.  Both on and off the field, Maris and Mantle would remain friends, each one cheering the other on.
This movie was lovingly directed by Billy Crystal, an avid baseball fan, who dedicated the movie to his father - the man who introduced him to the sport.  Barry Pepper portrayed Roger Maris perfectly: the happiness he shared with his family and friends and the anguish he experienced at the hands of the reporters and nay-sayers.  You truly believe you are seeing Maris in action.  Mickey Mantle is portrayed by Thomas Jane, who puts in an equally convincing performance.
Yes, we all know how it ends, but you'll still find yourself on the edge of your seat as Roger Maris blasts that 61st homerun out of the park!  See this movie today!!",1033430400,,3395,4.501633986928105

It really brought the history of the game to the forefront for me, as I did not realize the fans were so against Maris breaking Babe Ruth's record.  The fact that the record stood all these years with an asterix behind it, was unfair to Maris because his accomplishment was astounding and took many years to be matched.
Billy Crystal brought the story forward to when Maris's record was broken, with actual footage of the Maris family.

In fact, there are few better MOVIES, period, that I have ever seen (and that's saying a lot -- I introduced my three-year-old son to this movie a few months ago, and he has seen it every single DAY since then -- which means I've seen it too.) And can you believe it still is wonderful -- though I know every line, every word, every camera angle and cut? Crystal takes the heart of the subject -- Mantle & Maris and their pursuit of the record in full public view -- and shows us what we didn't know about them in 1961 -- Maris, the quiet, inarticulate but thoroughly decent family man, Mantle the hard-drinking, hard-living but ultimately insecure superstar who played despite constant, crippling pain -- and shows how they both attempted to rise above themselves and be the heroes they were already thought to be for the space of a few months in one special summer. That striving to be better than you are, with terrific pressure to perform (and in Maris's case, a lot of pressure NOT to perform, because fans didn't want HIM breaking Ruth's record) is, to me, the emotional center of the movie. It is so thoroughly understandable and so human, that even if you don't love baseball (are there such people?), you can still get close to this film. And if you do love it -- well, there can be no better film to see. We got it on DVD out of sheer self-defense -- there were too many `good parts' we wanted to see again and again -- and I think we may just have worn out the DVD. Don't miss the MAKING OF ... feature as well -- it's absolutely terrific in and of itself -- the clever and creative way Crystal and his people turned an old Detroit ballpark into the old Yankee Stadium and turned Anthony Michael Hall (who plays Whitey Ford) into a left-handed pitcher when he was, in fact, right-handed, is a lot of fun to watch just for the moviemaking trivia. In short (and I could go on and on) -- buy it. Watch it. Pass it on.

Thomas Jane plays and looks like Mickey Mantle
Barry Pepper looks like and plays Roger Maris to a tee
Michael Hall plays the fun loving, free caring White Ford

61* covers the 1961 baseball season, a season for the ages. In 1961, we had 2 teamates, not McGwire and Sosa (steriods and different teams), but Mantle and Maris, from the same team both going after Babe Ruth's HR record of 60 homeruns in 1 season.

Mantle is a Yankee legend, a hero to many and one of the greatest baseball players of his time. You really see the sad part about Mickey, what made him great and what made you really care about him.

His drinking problem, fooling around with girls, not always being their for his kids, and above all, just not taking care of himself as a person.
Mickey's family had a history of dying young with Hodgkins disease, so Mickey took that approach and lived a care-free life, which ultimately, cut his career, and sadly his life short. 61* exposes some of those aspects about Mickey.

Maris is a gamer, who grew up in North Dakota and married his high school sweetheart (like Mickey), only he's a real family man. Roger is a very humble person who wants to take care of his family and just play baseball. In 1961, Maris, who is coming off an MVP season in 1960, suddenly finds himself sharing the spotlight with Mickey, something Roger isn't too comfortable with. He's too humble, shy, and doesn't really understand the media and country's fascination with him. He doesn't have the charisma that Mickey has, and that turns members of the media away from Roger.

The pressure on Roger builds, and the strees of just how important the HR record is really starts to beat down on Roger, at times, he used to smoke over a pack of cigarettes a day. Roger also started losing his hair from the stress of the media, death threats from fans, and from the Ghost of the Babe.

Everyone knows the history of the story, but not many know the struggles, the true background of the 1961 season. Billy Crystal did an amazing job with 61*, in showing you that story.

What is amazingly sad about the ending of 61*, is that Roger never knew that he held the HR record to himself, because MLB at the time still had the asterik* to the HR record, because during the 1961 season, MLB added 8 more games to the season. The double wammy at the end of course is that McGwire broke Maris' record, and yet, McGwire did it under steriods.

When you see the Maris story, what he had to go through, and then you hear about McGwire's steriod use, as a baseball purist, you get angry. True baseball fans however, I believe, still and will always regard Maris' 61 as the true HR record for 1 season.

61* is an amazing baseball story and an amazing personal story. There is one key documentary that gives you a backdrop on the making of 61*, including where the film was shot, why Billy Crystal chose Thomas Jane and Barry Pepper, and above all, why he chose to make this film.

I love movies with heart and soul, and Billy Crystal sure put his heart and soul into  61*, which is why, in the end, it's a winner.",1020124800,,3253,4.421404682274248

Maris was portrayed as a very good baseball player; the more complete truth was that Maris was a superior ATHLETE who chose baseball over football because he did not care for life on a college campus. He was actually offered a scholarship to Oklahoma, (he still holds the national high school record for kickoff returns for touchdowns in one game) but declined after trying campus life for about a week after his high school graduation.
Above all, Maris was a winner. After he left the Yankees, he finished his career with the Cardinals - played in two World Series with them and won one.

Billy has poured all his affection for the Yankees [and baseball] into this effort, and the result is a very realistic gaze back in time.  This has now become one of my favorite baseball movies!
The extra features are also first-rate on this DVD.  The ""making of"" featurette (50 min.) is dynamite!  We follow Billy, cast, and crew during the production of the picture. Very well done!  A great moment during the documentary is the clip from 1977, when Crystal gets to meet his idol, Mickey Mantle, during an appearance on the ""Dinah"" show.  Mick, for the second time, signs Billy's original 1956 Yankees' souvenir program.

1624311,5,B00005M20M,"In 1961, a little known player named Roger Maris would end up overshadowing his teammate Mickey Mantle and break Babe Ruth's ""unbreakable"" single season home run record. 1961 was the first year of the 162 game schedule. Up until 1961, the baseball season consisted of 154 games. Ford Frick, the baseball commissioner at the time, declared that any record broke during the 162 game season would have an asterisk placed after it.  Roger Maris hit his 61 home runs in 162 games, which is why the asterisk appears in the title. This movie does an excellent job of showing the viewer the tremendous pressure that Maris and Mantle faced that summer.  Mantle came close to Ruth's record as well, hitting 54 home runs before getting injured late in the season.  Maris was constantly hounded by reporters throughout the season.  His family also received death threats, and his hair began to fall out.  Mantle was Maris' greatest supporter and his best friend.  They ended up sharing an apartment in New York and lived there during the season.  I've been a baseball fan most of my life, and this movie was truly a treat for me to watch.  Any baseball fan shpould watch this excellent movie. Also, commissioner Fay Vincent got rid of the asterisk rule, so Maris' record stood without the asterisk until 1998.",1012262400,4,1297,4.7847533632287

1624313,5,B00005M20M,"Billy Crystal has shown baseball fans (and especially die-hard Yank fans) that it is possible to turn a labor of love and a 'kid's' dream into a reality-on-film epic of the M&M boys and do it with style, an eye for detail, credibility and truth (even if it may hurt..sorry guys!). Barry Pepper et. al. are superb, realistic and down to earth in depicting the behind-the scenes 'sagas' that were going on while the baseball fans held their collective breath for the home run race. Sure, you cannot jam all the details of this baseball era into one film, both good and bad: would you watch an 8 hour movie? There is enough 'meat' to chew on here and experience the relationship of two baseball greats perceived as being at odds and understand that while totally different personae, they were good buddies, they loved the game, played their hearts out and were darn good at it!! Billy Crystal lavishes the audience with much to ponder and an up close revelation at how bad sports management can really be, while the players do all they can to be the very best. This sports film is without question one of THE very best out there. It comes as no suprise that Maris' wife presented Barry Pepper with her husband's playing glove after she saw this film, as a token of admiration and appreciation for his very credible role as her late husband; if you can impress the wife who shared in the agony and the joy..then you can certainly turn a few heads towards the T.V. to watch this film, be it H.B.O or not...doesn't matter. Grab this DVD (or VHS) and enjoy. Applause to Billy Crystal..yes I do admire him tremendously; he's not just all about laughs; he is a serious person about acting and the craft of going behind the lens to have baseball history come alive and credible on film.",1010361600,,1776,4.535825545171339
1624314,5,B00005M20M,"""61*"" tells the story of the epic home-run battle between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961. For the better part of the season, the sports world stood on its ear as the New York Yankee outfielders belted homer after homer in their quest of baseball's most hallowed record, the 60 round-trippers posted by Babe Ruth in 1927. While game re-creation is marvelously done (thanks to some sprucing up of old Tiger Stadium, made to look like pre-renovation Yankee Stadium), Billy Crystal's labor of love is really more of an insightful look into the outer and inner pressures that threatened Maris' sanity. Physically, Barry Pepper is a virtual dead ringer for Maris. At first sight, Thomas Jane doesn't remind you that much of Mantle, yet the more you see the movie, the more like the Mick he looks. Crystal pulls no punches in his portrayal of the crude yet beloved Mantle - a womanizer and the antithesis of his good friend Maris, ever the family man. Anthony Michael Hall (yes, the same actor who starred years ago in ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Weird Science""), plays the great Whitey Ford, but it's regrettably only a minor role. Still, one can see why the Yankees called Whitey the ""Chairman of the Board."" Another great nuance: Hoyt Wilhelm, who retired Maris in the ninth inning of Game 154, preventing him from tying Ruth's record in the ""prescribed"" number of games set forth by baseball commissioner Ford Frick, is perfectly played by former major-league knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who holds his head in tilted fashion just like Wilhelm did. While I question how much a non-baseball fan would like the movie, for an old Mantle-Yankee fan like yours truly, it's definitely a must-see and must-own.",1009584000,9,1702,4.892733564013841

1624316,4,B00005M20M,"The two men racing to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record in 1961 were about as different as they could be.  Mickey Mantle was the rock star of the Yankees, beloved by fans, living fast and hard, while Roger Maris was, as the film puts it, ""at best, a very good player,"" but also a reserved, everyday family man.  It seems almost incongruous that the one to break the record was the last one everyone expected, and ""61*"" suggests, not the player the public wanted.
The film is excellent at portraying the building tension of the season, as Mick and Maris, the M & M boys, battle against each other for the record.  But director Billy Crystal dispels the myth that Maris and Mantle were at odds with each other.  If anything, the film shows that their greatest enemy was the press, who mercilessly play up any misstep by the withdrawn, non-charismatic Maris.  Baseball commissioner Ford Frick is also depicted in a less-than-sympathetic light, as a stodgy old-timer who wants to preserve the Babe's record at any cost, a desire that manifests itself in the asterisk that appeared after Maris' record until 1991.
Unlike their forebears, Ruth and Gehrig, Mantle and Maris are portrayed as having a very supportive friendship, devoid of competition.  They share an apartment together, and Mantle helps Maris through the daily press barrage.  Although Crystal is ostensibly a huge fan of baseball and Mickey Mantle, he does not shy away from the less-savory details of Mick's personal life, his womanizing and reckless living that even he admitted stunted his career.  It really makes a fan wonder what could have been if Mickey Mantle had taken better care of himself.
But, as the film progresses, it become less about Mantle and more about the unlikeliest of heroes, Roger Maris.  Barry Pepper not only looks enough like Maris to be his brother, he nails the conflict and torment that he faced when shoved into the limelight, turning Maris into a sympathetic, complex character.  Thomas Jane may not have Mantle's sweet swing and powerful physique, but he shines at portraying Mantle's fun-loving, live-for-today attitude, as well as his own inner struggle.  His wisecracks add much-needed levity to a film that could have been mired in its own self-importance.
Sports-themed films that hark back to the glory days of a sport often take on a mythic aspect that often rob the film of its honesty.  ""61*"" embraces the myth but doesn't eschew the honesty, resulting in what is arguably a much more rewarding film.",1009238400,,2519,4.9011764705882355
1624317,5,B00005M20M,"One of the best baseball movies I've seen in sometime. Move over Kevin, congratulations Billy. Of course, it won't beat Ken Burns' documentary Baseball. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane make you feel you're watching the M&M duo again. Brings back nostalgia of the year we were tracking over short wave radio everyday what two Yankees had done that day.
The Yankees wasn't my favorite team.  It was the Brooklyn Dodgers and later on L.A. Dodgers.  I just hated it how the Yankees kept beating my team except in '55. But that year, I started liking the Yankees for the excitement they were bringing to Baseball. Of course I was rooting for Mantle but for me, may the best man that season win.
Those were the days when our only problems were doing the homework for the following day. Sighhhhh..The Age of Innocence.
It was a disgrace how the commissioner downplayed the record with an asterisk.  Were all the records that year and after marked with an asterisk?",1008547200,2,954,4.700598802395209
1624318,5,B00005M20M,"This movie is part drama part documentary.  I enjoyed learning about how Maris broke Ruth's single season home run record in 1961.  The attention to detail in the movie was spectacular.
Roger Maris was a quiet hard-working ball player from North Dakota.  He was a family man who never sought the spotlight, but was right in the middle of it in 1961.  All in all, he didn't handle it well.  Not many of us would have.
Mickey Mantle was comfortable in the spotlight. He wanted to break Ruth's record and had a shot at it for much of 1961.  Injuries plagued him that year, as they did for much of his career with the Yankees.
This story, at its heart, is about the realationship of these two men.  The press portrayed them as competitors, but on a basic level they were teammates trying to win ball games.  I was especially impressed by the character of Mantle.  He rooted for Maris from a hospital bed on the last day of the season, when Maris broke the record.  Mantle was a very flawed, yet he was hard not to like.  Marris was harder to like, but easier to admire.  He had a strength of character that not many men would display in a similar setting.
The DVD also contains a feature on how this film was made that is well worth watching.  Billy Crystal put this film together with painstaking detail.  He was 13 in 1961, lived in New York, and attended Yankees games.  This movie was a labor of love for him, and it shows.

I'm not sure that there is a rendition of the homerun race of 1961 that is more accurate.  There are alot of myths and untruths that surround the 61 season and I think this film exposes a lot of them.
The movie has its funny moments too.  The Mick's drunken carousing, Yogi's signature quotes and the Babe's wife's reaction to Maris tying the record come to mind.
I would give this movie a perfect rating but, as with almost any baseball movie, you need to know alot of the background before you can fully enjoy the movie.

Since I wasn't born back then it was interesting that they were both on the same team and that everybody was rooting for the Mick and everybody booing Roger. Maris had a very difficult and stressful season. Maris was the beating mickey thourgh almost the whole season.

1624327,5,B00005M20M,"I knew when I read about this movie and saw Billy Crystal's name attached to it that it would be a work of love. And I was not diasppointed.
61* takes us back to 1961 and retells the classic home run race between Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris as they both tried to catch Babe Ruth's then record of 60. The initial part of the story is told from the the Maris family perspective in 1998 as Mark McGwire was chasing Roger on his way to the then record of 70 (smashed by Barry Bonds with 73). If you will recall that historic moment, you will recall the homage that McGwire paid to the Maris family.
61* is not so much a baseball movie (even though I called it that) as it is a movie about rivalry and friendship between two very different men. The movie is not afraid to show them as fallible but it does so with dignity and explains why they may have these foibles. Mantle is shown as being the utlimate Amercian icon. Every kid growing up wanted to be Mickey Mantle. Blond, good looking and playing centerfield for the Yankees - what more could one ask for. But the dark side of Mantle - his womanizing and drinking is not ignored. But we come to understand that Mantle was afraid of dying. No man in his family had ever lived to 40 and we get the feeling that he wanted to enjoy life when he could. Maris is shown as being quite and introverted and moody, but when we see the enormous pressure he is put under, we understand. Maris never asked for the limelight. All he wanted to do is to help his team win.
Mantle and Maris are shown as rivals - there's tension and there is also love. We see that Maris had no greater fan and supporter than Mantle. Mantle admires what his friend is going through and perhaps is relieved that some of the pressure is removed from him - after all - Mantle was expected to hit a home run every time at bat.
The dark side of the story is the totally unnecessary pressure and hatred that Maris endures. He gets hate mail, he has chairs thrown at him, the press gangs up on him. Why? Because he was breaking a record of an Yankee and the public wanted only another Yankee icon - Mantle - to break that record. Maris was not a real Yankee (he was acquired in a trade) and that was what irked and irritated his detractors. Never mind that he had been MVP in 1960. Flash forward to 10 years later and you can get a glimpse of what Henry Aaron went through as he approached the Babe's career home run record. 61* is also an indictment of sports fans and reporters and how we have our priorities totally out of whack, especially when we think about how these days, New Yorkers wish that all they had to care about WAS a home run race.
The DVD's main bonus feature, worth the viewing alone, discusses how the movie was made.  It was fascinating to hear of the transformation of old Tiger Stadium in Detroit into Yankee Stadium, and how the movie was cast.  In a bit of trivia which ties into the Bonds home run record, Thomas Jane (who plays Mickey Mantle) had never picked up a baseball until he got this part.  Billy Crystal sent him to a school to learn some baseball skills.  Jane's instructor was Reggie Smith, a distant Bonds' cousin.  Isn't it funny how life comes full cycle?
Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane are fully believable as the duo and give excellent performances. 61* will delight baseball and non baseball fans, because the beauty of the movie is the relationship between the two men ad how, in the face of immense odds, friendship can endure.",1001721600,3,3483,4.303353658536586

But when this movie debuted on HBO, I was glued to the screen.  I couldn't believe how this movie roped me in and didn't let go until it was over.  In fact, when it was over, I was wishing for more.  I'm not a  huge sports fan, but I am a huge movie fan, and this movie is one of my new all time favorites.  I highly reccomend it to everyone.",995414400,11,463,3.9782608695652173

7944889,5,B00005M20M,"Great baseball movie with very good attention to detail.  Even though the on-field scenes were mainly shot at old Tiger Stadium in Detroit, the CG layover of Yankee Stadium from 1961 was done very well, and with accurate details that transports to viewer back in time to 1961.  Even more amazing is the uncanny resemblance of lead actor Barry Pepper to Roger Maris himself!  Both he and Thomas Jane give fantastic performances as Maris and Mickey Mantle.  Billy Crystal hit a home run with this movie.  The viewer can feel the mounting pressure on Maris and the stress it caused this very humble and private man in his quest to eclipse the single season home run reacord set by Babe Ruth 34 years prior.  I love this film and consider it the classiest and one of the best baseball movies ever made (The Natural, 42, The Love of the Game).  Thank you Billy Crystal!",1518393600,2,864,4.571428571428571
