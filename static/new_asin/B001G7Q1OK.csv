I don't want to spend the time returning it and trying to eat up my time going back and forth.",1265241600,2,267,4.056603773584905
3597858,4,B001G7Q1OK,My four year old girl asked for the whole set of ice age movies including Scrat! Her and I go to the movies often. She also likes Wall-E and Land of the Lost movies. I do not like Alvin and the Chipmunks and will give that one away without opening it.,1264896000,,251,3.9411764705882355

3597861,1,B001G7Q1OK,"What is Amazon doing?  The price for this last week was $22.99.  Yesterday it was $28.99 and TODAY it is $32!  When I noticed that I finally read the comments, which I should have done before ordering and found out this is a poor quality set.  What a rip off!  Avoid this and Amazon's price yo-yo.  Over the past week the prices have zoomed up on many media items.",1262044800,7,364,4.202898550724638
3597862,4,B001G7Q1OK,"Little disappointed about the video quality of these BluRays. At first I thought for $28ish it was a heck of a deal. It still is. The video quality certainly is not near the normal bluray quality I'm used to. In fact, its half the quality. Just seems like a quality between dvd and bluray. Basically got 3 high quality DVDs for under $30. No real complaint, just wasn't expecting a lower quality version, though the price was a good hint to begin with anyways. I also didn't get this for Alvin and the Chipmunks. I have no interest for it.",1261785600,12,539,4.4
3597863,1,B001G7Q1OK,"DO NOT BUY THIS. Its NOT a bluray quality, not even close. Its a total RIP OFF. Ordinary DVD version is even better.",1261267200,10,116,4.086956521739131
3597864,2,B001G7Q1OK,"Wow a 3 pack of blu-ray for a little over twenty bucks.  What a deal...right?  Hold on the picture quality doesn't seem to be very good.  What's this?  Video is AVC 16Mbps ???  What does that mean?  Let me see my Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaur Blu-ray.  Hmmm, Video is AVC 32Mbps.  Well that's no good.  I don't know why they did this but these 3 pack blu-ray aren't the same as the normal blu-ray.  Tho they come in individual blu-ray cases.  They are the watered down version.  They don't come with digital copy and they are only half of the normal resolution.  The sound is DTS-HD and they do contain the normal amount of secondary audio.  Only thing that made me mad is if I had wanted a watered down version I would have stayed with my upconverted DVD version which is basically what this is.",1261094400,41,795,4.283783783783784
3597865,3,B001G7Q1OK,"I have some issues to coment this time...

I was waiting for a Ice Age pack but this was the bes I could get... but NOW... you are having a pack for Ice Age, thats not fair... anyway...

And the pack, I always use to buy Blurays from Amazon to Per (my location)

But This time, the package came broke, 2 of the blue boxes were broke, and the external box (the one who holds the 3 blurays, was not in close to merely good.

Anyway, about the movies, a great buy, I hope that kind of things (the one about the package, and the other about the condition of the product) Careful my dear amazon.

Hope this would help to be more careful about delivery.",1260662400,,647,4.103174603174603

8304402,1,B001G7Q1OK,"Frankly I couldn't care less about digital versions or a DVD version of any Blu-ray movie I buy, this is a typical Blu-ray rip-off. Do not buy this on Blu-ray!!! Save a few pennies and buy the DVD version.",1271030400,,205,4.282051282051282
8304403,4,B001G7Q1OK,"Don't let the poor reviews fool you.  Many of them present distorted facts about inferior quality because of reasons X or Y; when the reasons presented don't even affect quality of video.

The Ice Age titles offered in this box are the same as the ones in the individual releases, yet often this box is much cheaper than the individuals.  I purchased this when it was $30 for the box set, so to me that is good value; if you can get it for similar or less then that is great!

As far as the movies, watching the Ice Age trilogy in order you can clearly see the progression in animation technologies (I watched 1-3 within a few days of each other). However, that doesn't mean that the Blu-ray release is a bad one or that you should buy DVDs. I believe each of the movies in this box set offers a significant video and audio upgrade from the DVD versions of the same movie.

I ended up keeping Alvin and the Chipmunks despite not having that intention because I ended up watching it more than once with my nephews, who both loved the movie.

I recommend purchasing this box set if you are interested in two out of three of these movies or you are willing to re-sell the movies in the set you don't want, it has been and should continue to be the cheapest way to purchase these movies until alternate box sets become available (such as a true Ice Age Trilogy set).",1268006400,4,1362,4.30078125
