7925940,3,B00004XMT9,I would rather put the money towards something else it's good nice to watch but if you want to hear music with a few simple shots of the Islands you can get more out buying a CD & looking at a book,1400457600,,197,3.7142857142857144
7925941,1,B00004XMT9,"This video is similar to what you might see at a home electronics store to showcase the quality of TV's 36"" and below. It states it was filmed in pure digital video quality, but putting it on my 52"" HDTV, the video quality is horrid. The background music could best be described as ""royalty free"" and boring.

I wanted a video that showcased the Virgin Islands richly. What I got was this subpar, near motionless bore. I completely agree as well with the other two reviewers who awarded this one star.",1149379200,,501,4.5054945054945055
7925942,5,B00004XMT9,"This video is about relaxation. The video quality is extremely high, and the audio track is just there for some background volume.  This video may be a shock to a generation used to three jump cuts per second, but for me, this is peaceful and idyllic. Yes, it is a camera running, just filming a day in the Virgin Islands. THAT'S THE POINT! This video takes you to places in the Virgins where you sit, just like a tourist, and watch the day pass over you. Well, maybe you and I aren't doing the same things on vacation.

The point is an experience, not a documentary of any specific action. I watch this at least once a month. I want more videos just like this one. The producers of Caribbean Dreaming ""get it.""

I wanted a window on a beautiful Caribbean world, and this video gave it to me. You can measure your attention span by the beauty you find in this work of art.

Oh, and the audio track grows on you. I rather enjoy it, and I find it's gentle sounds match the mood of the video.

Great work on this one.",1137369600,,1014,4.206185567010309
7925943,1,B00004XMT9,"I've never written a review before but this was such a waste of money I felt compelled.  The reviewer before had it exactly - someone set up a camera and left it on.  The only way I could tell there was motion (on most of the shots) was to speed it up to 16x or more.  If it had been all just waves, that might have been ok.  But 10 minutes of a single flower slightly swaying in the breeze...which could have been filmed anywhere...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!  You can HAVE my copy since I won't ever use it again.",1097884800,3,505,4.0606060606060606
7925944,4,B00004XMT9,"This DVD is breathtakingly beautiful. However, do not mistake it for a travelogue video. The DVD content is comprised of serene Virgin Islands settings filmed around the islands at different times of day and at different speeds. It's a Caribbean slant on the Asian feng shui/relaxation videos, although no Caribbean interiors are shown. The entire video is shot outside...which, for the Virgin Islands, says it all. It's a great DVD and definitely a BARGAIN at Amazon.com's low price, but don't expect a narrator or any verbal information. Just expect to melt into your chair and drift away into the relaxing music and visuals that are a definite testament to the existence of a Higher Power...",978998400,9,694,5.043478260869565
