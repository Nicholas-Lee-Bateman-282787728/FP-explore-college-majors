6308700,3,B00J1470EU,The sound was horrible. It was hard to tell what was going on half the time. But overall for a found footage type horror it had its scares & cgi was used at times. The ending was rather predictable though.,1453593600,,205,4.15
6308701,5,B00J1470EU,Love my horror movies,1453507200,,21,4.5
6308702,1,B00J1470EU,soo bad not worth even the time. The people in it are so dumb.,1452729600,2,62,3.5

6308704,5,B00J1470EU,I have a friend that gets screeners from distributors and he knows I love alien movies so he hooked me up.  I'm real excited it's coming out now.  I saw it like 5 months ago and loved it.  If you like this kind of stuff it's a must-have.  I'm buying just to have in my collection and the box front looks awesome!,1395792000,,312,3.9838709677419355
6308705,5,B00J1470EU,"This movie really scared the hell out of me!
Shot on a budget, with camera in hand, this found footage distinguishes itself for its great special effects, extremely realistic.
When the aliens arrive, you will believe they're real!",1395705600,,230,5.078947368421052
6308706,1,B00J1470EU,"The worst people in the world who know how to operate a camera decide to investigate alien sightings in a remote area. Of course when they do find them, it is 6 days of filming at night with people screaming in the dark and running with a camera and flashlight. This film was designed to annoy us.

On the plus side you get to see some aliens early. Unfortunately they don't kill Amber (Michela Bruni) allowing her to scream and abuse English for most of the film. The film begs the question, ""Did anyone review this production prior to putting it out to market?"" And ""Why does Alessio Liguori believe he can write and direct?""

Definitely worth a punch on the hacker card.

Not worthy of a cheap rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, male nudity, off screen rape?",1394841600,6,759,4.518248175182482
6308707,2,B00J1470EU,"This movie had promise, except that I could barely understand what was being said in many of the scenes because of poor audio quality. That seems to be an issue with some of these movies, it's especially bad when there are one on one scenes when it starts off like they're whispering, but if you turn the sound up enough to hear it, the next scenes with screaming or discussions with more characters, almost breaks your ear drums.
Anyway, this movie had some good scary moments, especially when they're walking through the dark woods, but I'll be darned if I could figure out what was supposed to be going on, I don't see why anyone would be stupid enough to go off in the middle of a very dark place, chasing what? I was getting seasick though, or I guess it would be nauseated, in the scenes near the end with those endless walking through buildings, what were they trying to do, imitate ""Cloverfield""? I think the ending was an interesting twist, though, and it wasn't so much the actual scenes, but it was what the final ""report"" had to say about it, now that was very different. While another reviewer didn't like it, I thought it added an unexpected take on what had happened, and I believe that if they had incorporated those final notes into actual scenes as part of the movie, it might have turned into a better movie.",1506556800,,1327,4.487603305785124
6308708,1,B00J1470EU,Made it half way through and I love cheesy and weird movies but in this one I could not take any more screaming hysterical woman and no one to smack them to shut them up and I am female.  Really not much to be scared of just a glimpse of something?,1506470400,,248,3.8627450980392157
6308709,3,B00J1470EU,"More like 2.5 stars. I enjoyed the last 45 minutes of the film. It is a bit slow moving and has a ridiculous found footage setup. The introduction of the footage and its ending conclusion leave me to wonder why they bothered with such useless implausible information. It's not like NASA reported something actual for this film to question in order to make the premise more believable. I think the approach was wrong and gives the opposite desired effect. However, once the aliens show up it gets somewhat better because I wasn't expecting decent special effects from the way this feature starts out. Some of the running around could have been cut from the film and there is no real character development here. I didn't care enough for what happened to anyone here and only wondered why they don't get abducted or mutilated sooner.

Found footage is over/misused and I wish this way of visual story telling would stay lost. It's lazy and unnecessary. Only a few films have pulled this off well enough. This film could have been much better if they had just shot a straight forward narrative, especially since they seem to have had a little more resources to work with.",1506297600,2,1167,4.720588235294118
6308710,1,B00J1470EU,"Couldn't do it, nope, made it maybe 30 mins in and just couldn't continue. i love these style of movies i think they're a lot of fun, but this was just horribly bad. The acting sucked, the lead characters voice was horrible, it was unbelievably slow, the first scary scene was absolutely ruined by microphone shattering screaming, not at all worth it.",1505260800,,351,4.67741935483871
6308711,1,B00J1470EU,"Packed with intensely loud jump scares. I couldn't take it after about a half hour in. Maybe something makes sense but the volume and frequency of the jump scares made it not worth the effort for me anyway. I honestly don't remember anything else except that. Very, very annoying.",1500768000,3,280,4.73469387755102
6308712,1,B00J1470EU,"Wow, what a waste of potential here. Maybe 10 minutes of genuinely cool ideas and effects buried in a bloated run time that has very little happening.

A lot of actively irritating things here that sink this near the bottom of my list. The casts thick accents and the volume going up and down wildly combine to make it tough to know whats going on. This thing is nearly two hours, with a minimum of 30 minutes absolutely wasted- standing around talking random nonsense that doesn't build plot or character.",1500163200,,506,4.622222222222222

6308716,1,B00J1470EU,"What a piece of crap. I couldn't get past 10 minutes of this dreck.  I don't know what this movie was supposed to be, but it's so bad that it makes Plan 9 Oscar worthy.  I quit watching when it became Blair Witch meets Paranormal Activity meets the X-Files.  And not in a good way. Trust me, you want to avoid this crap like the plague.  This shouldn't even have been put on a disk, much less a streaming service.",1456617600,,413,4.125

6308719,1,B00J1470EU,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The volume goes from nearly whispers to loud yelling and screaming. Besides the obvious volume control, the actors were awful and the lines were worse. The camera keeps jumping from one person's view to the computer to another person's view and I would get lost at who we were viewing what scenes with. I couldn't bear to watch this for more than 20mins. Very very very bad movie.",1455840000,,425,4.461538461538462
6308720,1,B00J1470EU,"Extremely poor audio production quality with volume 100 disruptive sound and volume 5 dialogue.  Video quality is extremely poor version of ""found footage"".

Save your eyes and ears for something worthwhile.  This isn't it.",1455321600,,223,5.5
6308721,5,B00J1470EU,"This film was a lot more sophisticated than most hand-held camera movies.  The beginning is pretty silly and boring.  Just push on to get to the more exciting action.  For sure, you get to see a lot of creepy, menacing aliens.",1454976000,,226,4.463414634146342
6308722,1,B00J1470EU,got 30 min in and that was all I could take. some kids ruining around with a camera in the woods is about all this is. heck I think some random kids ruining around at night would have turned out better than this. I am one to give a film the benefit of the dought and see it thru but this was so bad I could not even do that.,1454284800,4,324,3.642857142857143
6308723,4,B00J1470EU,It really started slow but really picked up.  The sound could have been better.  It is one of your typical found footage films with a little twist but has the same ending as all.  It is time to re-think this genre and come up with new endings.,1454198400,,243,4.127659574468085
6308724,3,B00J1470EU,"Not bad , kept my interest",1454198400,,26,3.5
6308725,3,B00J1470EU,"As someone already stated, it had moments that were suspenseful, with a few good shocks of seeing the aliens, butI could not understand where the characters were or where thet were going.  It was scene ofter scene of humans running through the woods, or running through seemingly endles vacant buildings. For those who said the audio was poor, be thankful you did not hear the endless and very annoying screaming of the women--OMG. Ths parts I could understand were good, in fact, very good.  Those parts are worth watching, the rest you can fast forward through without worrying about missing something important.",1454025600,2,614,5.009803921568627
6308726,2,B00J1470EU,"Very poor storyline, difficult to understand because of sound issues.  Even with Closed Captioning, the actors kept screaming, asking questions and then running down a series of long, dark hallways.  Turn a corner, see a second (glimpse) of an alien head, foot, knee etc..then the turn a corner, and repeat the same trek down a different, dark, dank hallway.  Such a terrible waste of time, I had to fast forward parts of it.  Too slow, dull and predictable.",1454025600,,458,4.833333333333333

6.  Leave bad review and file a restraining order against the director to make sure he can never come within 500 feet of a camera since he's clearly abusive.",1525219200,,315,4.517857142857143
8647225,3,B00J1470EU,Ok but all the dam screaming and crying almost made me shut it off. Not bad except for that.,1521936000,,92,3.8947368421052633

8647227,1,B00J1470EU,"Perhaps the stupidest movie I have ever seen.  The actors basically ran around and screamed incoherently for 2 long hours.  I lasted about thirty minutes before my head aches and my ears bled.
  Who ever made this mess ,  do not give up your day job movie making is not your thing.  Go find that and leave the rest of us alone.",1521331200,,327,4.193548387096774

8647230,3,B00J1470EU,"This is a no-gore or no blood type of sci fi. Very shaky camera footage. The 1st 2 thirds of the movie are truly boring and somewhat annoying. However, if you invest any time in this, the last 30 minutes are the better third and what gave this 3 stars.",1517616000,,252,4.06
8647231,4,B00J1470EU,What did you guys expect it to be an Oscar award nominee movie its a indie movie and most movies of the alien found footage are like this or similar. If you want a really good one look for the phoenix anthology movies. I like that it was different i wished it had more of the Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County(1998) grainy film style to make it more realistic but most Sci-Fi movies are pretty lame but that's what makes it so good. its not as bad as the webisodes on youtube,1513728000,,482,4.193548387096774
8647232,1,B00J1470EU,"Ugh.  Nearly 20 years after Blair Witch Project and they are still ripping off that film. Funny how no matter dire things get, there is always someone to hold the camera and film things.  Unlike Blair Witch, the character's motives and goals are confusing as is the dialogue. The actress who played Amber had the classic Hollywood Plunger Lips and did a poor Heather Donahue crying scene. Hmm the aliens only show up in the phone camera.  At least, now I know how to look for aliens! Funny how the phone camera picks them up but the regular video camera does not?  And those aliens are camera shy too!  LOL 1 star is too many for this mess.",1508630400,,640,4.389830508474576
