8337830,5,B001RE9HH0,"What would you make of an opera that follows this basic pattern? Recitative-Aria, Recitative-Aria, Recitative-Aria, etc. for four hours!
In this case, you get Handel's TAMERLANO with vivid dramatic interplay of characters via recitative and one gorgeous aria after another, all of them revealing deep sentiment or powerful emotions.  Handel's operas lack the mighty choruses that play such a marvelous role in his oratorios. I admit for many years I simply ignored his operas because the slow pace, unpunctuated by the sweeping chorus, left me - frankly - bored. All of that has changed for three reasons: First and foremost, the superior musicianship of current singers and conductors; second, the brilliant stage directors who turn singers into actors giving them gestures and expressions that animate the text; finally, some soul-change in me I still don't understand. Paul McCreesh, a much honored Baroque specialist, conducts a flowing, emphatic performance, and succeeds in making this modern orchestra SOUND Baroque. Placido Domingo does not sound Baroque, but I would follow him anywhere because of his integrity, commitment - his prowess as
a singer and an actor. Here he adds gravitas to the opera, achieving a Shakespearean intensity in portraying a defeated king who must bow again to his harsh destiny to save his beloved daughter. It is amazing to witness this sixty-eight year old singer take on yet another challenge in his illustrious career. Monica Bacelli is in fine voice as the title character, and deftly portrays the world conqueror as a vain, flighty, superficial person. Compared to Marlowe's awesome characterization, this one seems scaled way down and not a worthy adversary for Domingo's Bajazet. In contrast, the characterization of Andronico, Tamerlano's Greek ally in
love with Bajazet's daughter Asteria, is profoundly moving, as he attempts to stop further bloodshed and realize his true love. In a different scenario, Andronico  would be the tragic hero torn between two good things, only one of which can prevail. Only the Baroque insistence on a happy ending saves him from a tragic destiny, but Handel's music, superbly sung by the glorious Sara Mingardo, is imbued with the tragic intensity the plot ignores. Ingela Bohlin sings sweetly and persuasively as Asteria. Her performance convinces us that two men, Tamerlano and Andronico, would fall in love with her and that for Bajazet she is the nonpareil among daughters, worthy of the sacrifice he makes so that she can live and love. What beauty! What majesty! Bravo!",1402963200,,2556,5.262254901960785
8337831,3,B001RE9HH0,"I have recently watched BOTH available ""Tamerlano"" dvd's, this one and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-Tamerlano-Jonathan-Miller-Trevor-Pinnock-Bacelli-Randle-Pushee-Norberg-Schulz-Bonitatibus-Abete-Hndelfestspiele-Halle-2001/dp/B001URA64C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel - Tamerlano / Jonathan Miller, Trevor Pinnock - Bacelli, Randle, Pushee, Norberg-Schulz, Bonitatibus, Abete - Hndelfestspiele Halle 2001</a>.  This review will compare both videos, while containing a full review of this one.

First, the opera itself.  ""Tamerlano"" is one of a trio of ""heroic"" operas that Georg Handel wrote in the mid-1720's in London.  The others are ""Giulio Cesare"" and ""Rodelinda.""  All three are masterpieces and were successful at the time.  In recent years, as the Handel revival keeps getting more steam, they are staged more frequently- and available on dvd.

Tamerlano is the vindictive triumphant conqueror over the noble Bajazet in the 1400's (which is based on historical events).  Tamerlano seeks to marry Bajazet's beautiful daughter Asteria (who loves and is loved by King Andronicus of Greece- a supporter of Tamerlano).  Tamerlano is betrothed to Princess Irene (whom he has never seen.)  Proud and heroic Bajazet strongly opposes Asteria's marriage to Tamerlano, and prefers a noble death for both of them, rather than bow down to the dictates ov the evil victor, Tamerlano.  During this dark drama, Asteria tries to kill Tamerlano twice.  In the end Bajazet, who has taken poison off-stage, has a significant death scene on-stage to foil Tamerlano's vengeance.  In the usual opera seria conclusion, Tamerlano agrees to marry Irene, let Asteria marry Andronicus, and the final chorus sings a happy end, even while the music itself sounds quite melancholy.

This death scene was quite revolutionary in Baroque opera (even though the actual death, in BOTH productions) occurs off-stage.  In fact, the whole ""tinta"" of the piece is quite dark and somber- making for a very effective drama.

Now for the video itself- This performance takes place in the Teatro Real in Madrid in 2009.  It is performed on modern instruments (other than a harpsichord) with a Baroque style.  Paul McCreesh is an experienced Baroque conductor.  The set is more problematic for me.  It is a large white semi-circle, with a series of doors along it.  More troubling is a large white ball (globe), with a giant foot on top that overhangs the entire set (and moves up and down)- apparently symbolizing the oppression felt by the characters in this dark drama.  Sorry, it didn't work for me.

The staging is also quite stylized/mannered.  Monica Bacelli as Tamerlano moves in an almost dance-like way, and there are frequent hand motions (including a duet with Andronicus- repeated at the end) that are interesting. (I do not whether these are considered authentic Barque style or not) In addition, there are 9 supernumeraries frequently on stage who perform dance movements while the action is going on.  They make an interesting visual, and are not a detriment, but an added element.

The key to this dvd, without question, is the performance of Placido Domingo as the heroic Bajazet.  Domingo is NOT a Baroque performer.  In the remarks by McCreesh in his interview (more below), he says that it was the first time Domingo had sung/performed in a Baroque opera.  And his performance and singing is NOT Baroque style at all.  It is purely Romantic- as you would expect.  AND it is excellent- highly dramatic and effective.  His Act 3 death scene is especially moving- but, of course he has done this literally thousands of times over the decades.  It isn't classic Baroque, but it is great theater and music.

The other singers are generally very good.  As was usually the case in Handel's operas, two of the key roles (Tamerlano and Andronicus) were written for castratos- men with soprano voices.  Here Tamerlano is song by Monica Bacelli (who ALSO sings that role on the other dvd), and Andronicus is sung buy a mezzo soprano, Sara Mingardo.  Unusual for Baroque opera, the key role of Bajazet is a tenor role (hard to come by in the 1700's) here sung by Domingo as cited above.

Finally, on the technical matters, the filming and sound are excellent, including DTS system, sub-titles well done.  There are two extras here as well.  One is a very good interview with Paul McCreesh about Handel's music.  The other is a video synopsis (using stills from the show) that helps tell the complicated story. One pet peeve I have is that in this filming, when the aria opens with a lengthy instrumental section (ritornello), rather than showing us the performer, it shows us the conductor.  wrong!!  Never show the conductor after he has taken his pre-performance bows until the final on stage bows.

If you have to have only one video of Tamerlano, I'd probably recommend the Halle performance. But this one with the terrific filming/sound, and the outstanding performance by Placido Domingo is well worth having as well.",1332547200,,5051,5.29937106918239
8337832,5,B001RE9HH0,"A most intense drama but an unsatisfactory ending. I'll start with the great things first. The singers were all strong, excellent, and well versed in the techniques of Baroque singing except for Placido Domingo. This was his first staging in this genre but he is an exceptional singer and was truly riveting as the fallen emperor. Monica Bacelli had done this part of Tamerlano in Trevor Pinnock 2009 DVD. In this same part in the present recording she is much more lively and her  technical competence is even greater. If she were just taller! The same goes for Sara Mingardo. She has a contalto voice that can master any difficulty in the notoriuosly difficult Baroque style and make it sound beautiful. The two of them together in the last act duetto ""Coronata di gigli e di rose"" was a particular treat. Ingela Bohlin was certainly up to her long role with some of the longest arias of them all. I've heard Jennifer Holloway, our Irene, in many other things and she has a most pleasing voice and manner. I am usually off put by modern staging but this one by Graham Vick was unobtrusive and serviceable and in the end I found it pleasing. The costumes were very handsome and approriately lavish. The background moving dance sheiks added some to the scenery and I loved the elephant. In all it was a great experience of a masterly opus but the end is puzzling. I feel that it would have helped if all of the exquisitely moving aria ""Su la sponda del pigro Lete"" had been sung (half was cut) and some how the opera ended after Bajazet's ""Su, via, furie e ministre"". Yes I know, that would have been Verdi, but. Anyway I think they did a really good job with a difficult masterpiece and I will enjoy it again and again.",1332115200,,1720,4.512820512820513
8337833,3,B001RE9HH0,"If one harbours high hopes for Domingo's Bajazet, let me report that you may be slightly disappointed.
True that he has the voice, the looks, the acting skill, but in the very first aria, he sounds so detached from the orchestra that one immediately wonders whether he has had any rehearsal at all with McCreesh before this performance...  His next aria is slightly better, from judging from his phrasing and nuances, he is obviously NOT at home with baroque singing.
The other characters sung in true baroque style.
Bacelli gives a valiant performance in the title role, though in terms of stage presence she is not impressive enough.
Bohlin sings well as Asteria, but she is notably taller than either Bacelli and Mingardo, alas.
As Adronicus, Sara Mingardo is superb in her extensive recitatives, but in the long arias, her lack of breath support in the soft passages rendered her often inaudible, which is a great shame.
Hollaway is an adequate Irene, and sings in true Handellian style.  She appears to be the singer who worked best with conductor McCreesh in this performance.
Paul McCreesh must be credited for conducting in authentic Handellian style.  The orchestra plays energetically throughout, fully alert musically.
Despite the obvious flaws, there is still a good share to enjoy, though it would be a bit too far-fetched to term this a 'great performance'.",1325548800,,1371,5.004385964912281
8337834,3,B001RE9HH0,"The production and perfomance of this opera on DVD was excellent. Placido Domingo was in excellent form considering his age and handled the demanding role of Bajazet beautifully.

But it was billed as ""virtually uncut"". Even in the documentary by McCreesh, he states the score was performed virtually uncut. That might be true for the Acts One and Two. But not so for Act Three.

Bajazet's opening aria in Act III only has the ""A"" section (this aria was recorded complete by Gardiner). Later in the 3rd act, arias for Irene, Leone, and Andronico are omitted. Two of these arias were recorded by Petrou and the other one by Malgiore.

In actuality, the third act as performed here is practically the same as in Gardiner's heavily cut recording on CD.

I really was hoping for a production of this opera containing all the music Handel wrote for 1724. The false advertising about its completeness prompted me to purchase this 3 DVD set and because of that I am disappointed and cannot give it more than 3 stars, even though the singing throughout was superb.",1254268800,8,1056,4.7228260869565215
8337835,5,B001RE9HH0,"Just wanted to get my two cents in here since there is only one review so far.  This is a very good dvd of Tamerlano, and I think it is much more interesting than the Pinnock dvd.  The production is typical Graham Vick, which is to say: stylish, thoughtful, a little unconventional but still very true to the work.  He contributes some new ideas here and there, but in a respectful way.  The costumes vaguely suggest 18th c. ideas of turquerie, but are schematic and exaggerated in some cases, with sober white costumes setting Bajazet and his daughter apart from the rest of the characters.  Tamerlano himself (Monica Bacelli) is a sort of flamboyant, Liberace-type character with very colorful costumes and lots of makeup, who interpolates some turkish-looking dance moves into his arias.  Very neat idea for this character, as his arias are very bouncy and dancelike tunes (shades of the McVicker Giulio Cesare? perhaps).  Asteria also is very well sung, and brings interesting middle-eastern style hand gestures into her first aria.  Domingo's Bajazet is good, altho he is not really a Handel singer, but this role suits him, and he is much more convincing as a father figure than some Bajazets are (young tenors don't seem grave enough...Randle is very young on the Pinnock dvd, and not really made to look old).  Mingardo's Andronico is well sung, although I thought she wasn't as comfortable in the trouser role; not charismatic, but vocally has the ability for this very, very difficult Senesino role.

As with Graham Vick's production of Mitridate re di Ponto from Covent Garden (also on DVD), there are groups of dancers who sometimes contribute to the ebb and flow of the emotions and music in the arias.  In only case case did I feel this didn't work quite right (Leone's aria).  It was a wonderful idea, and in fact, if you have seen that dvd of Mitridate, you can have a good idea of the overall feel of this production.  My only complaint about the dvd is that the video director made some annoying choices.  He regularly focuses on Paul McCreesh and the orchestra for longish periods of time, even though things are happening onstage.  I don't want to see the orchestra that much, and especially with a production as stimulating as this one, I want to see every moment onstage.  He also didn't do a good job of focusing on, or even showing, the dancers sometimes.  It was almost like he didn't like the dancing and wanted to show it as little as possible.  This was really annoying.  Finally, when Domingo was singing, he seemed to just want to go closer up on Domingo and ignore everything else on stage entirely.  Bad move.  I hate it when a stupid video director makes weird choices and ruins a perfect performance (Pierre Audi's dvd of Zoroastre is another example of this).  However, I should close by saying that the director doesn't do this kind of thing constantly, and overall he avoids close-up, going in only for waist length shots usually, which I like better.  So it is good in that respect most of the time.

Overall: highly recommended.  Certainly better than Pinnock's, and worth getting even if you are new to Handel opera.  I sold my dvd of the Pinnock one.  This is great.  I think there are lengthy clips from it on YouTube if you want to sample it before you buy this very expensive set.",1252713600,8,3324,4.694300518134715
8337836,5,B001RE9HH0,"Tamerlano is considered as one of Handel's greatest operatic masterpieces. He wrote this opera in the space of twenty days, in July 1724. This was a very productive year for Handel's operas: Gulio Cesare and Rodelinda were written in 1724 too, all three great operas to a libretto by Italian poet Nicola Francesco Haym.

Tamerlano had been recorded a few times. The best CD recording for my taste is the last: A MDG recording that is conducted by George Petru. On the Arthaus label there is a DVD version from the Handel Festival at Halle 2001. The conductor is Trevor Pinnock and stage director is Jonathan Miller. Musically this is an excellent performance, led by Italian mezzo-soprano Monica Bacelli as Tamerlano. But as a stage experience this performance is quite boring, with the singers standing on a small bare stage and singing long dacapo arias almost with no movements.

This month, Opus Arte released a new DVD version for Tamerlano. This is a 2008  production from Teatro Real in Madrid. Stage director is Graham Vick. The stage here is much more interesting, although it almost doesn't change during the opera. It has big white walls in the shape of a semicircle with a number of doors. Stage design is quite minimal but effective and always very esthetic and pleasant to the eye. But the main difference between the directors is in the singer's guidance. With Miller you get `stand and deliver', almost no interaction between the singers. In Madrid Graham Vick achieved totally other results: all the singers are acting effectively and impressively.

The Orchestra of Teatro Real is playing on modern instruments and is conducted by Paul McCreesh. He definitely knows how to conduct Handel, but I usually prefer HIP instruments in this music. There are a few ""authentic"" additions to the orchestra in particular in the wind department, flutes, recorders and old stringed instruments like a theorbo.

With respect to the singers - a very special feature of this production is the participation of Placido Domingo. In the age of 68 Domingo does not cease to surprise and he is singing for the first time in a Baroque opera the role of the Turkish sultan Bajazet, one of the greatest roles Handel created for a tenor.

The voice is relatively big and not flexible enough to be an ideal Baroque singer. But although the singing is technically not perfect, it is very impressive first of all on account of the phenomenon - a singer in the age 68 able to sing so, but in addition to this, Domingo, a really great artist brings his rich theatrical experience to portray very convincingly the suffering of the tormented ruler that fights in captivity for his daughter happiness. Luckily, the role is not very difficult...

The leading role - Tamerlano - is sung again by Italian mezzo-soprano Monica Bacelli. She is excellent both in singing (especially in her act III aria) and acting, portraying amusingly the Tartar ruler as an extrovert and capricious man. The role of Androniko, the Greek prince in love with Bajazet's daughter Asteria is sung by Italian contralto Sara Mingardo. She is excellent.

Asteria, Bajazet's daughter is sung by Swedish soprano Ingela Bohlin. She is outstanding. She is a very beautiful woman, with a lovely and angelic voice, and excellent technique. The other two minor roles are more than adequately taken by American soprano Jennifer Holloway as Irene and baritone Luigi di Donato as Leone.

To sum up: Highly recommended for all lovers of Baroque operas. This is a worthy performance for one of Handel's greatest creations.",1238198400,27,3567,4.931666666666667
