5990605,3,B00FFPYHHM,"It was OKAY; I wish it would have had INTERVIEWS with some of the stars, directors, writers, etc. But the DVD came in fine and the price was perfect!
I wish the content had been more than just trailers, many of which have been shown on other DVDs.",1429142400,5,247,4.166666666666667

8615361,3,B00FFPYHHM,"It is what it is, a compilation of B movie trailers. It starts getting old after about the first 30 minutes but that caged hostess kept me watching. At first I was not expecting much with the Chinese trailers but it's amusing to see how they imitate the American versions of these movies.

Other reviewers have already commented on the absence of trailers for some well known WiP films like Chained Heat. The 80s remake of Reform School Girl would have also fit in with the original version. I suspect that these were not included because since they were a notch higher in their production than the ones shown, the royalties to show their trailers would have been beyond budget.

Again, the hostess, I think her name was Roxie, was H-O-T. She should have gotten a lot more scenes. She could have used a shower. :)

In the end, I'm glad to have just rented this on Amazon rather than bought it.",1524355200,,893,4.5

8615367,3,B00FFPYHHM,"This is nothing more than prison girl movie trailers covering a long period of time and foreign films. Most trailers have nudity, the opening ones did not. I wish they had done more longer clips and less trailers. The reason I gave this piece of trash 3 stars is because it contained a number of films I had not seen or even knew existed...not that I am going to go seek them out. I mean if have seen one prison girl film, you know the plot for all of them.",1441929600,2,457,4.088888888888889
8615368,3,B00FFPYHHM,Great review of classic female cult movies. I thought it was a feature film. Still enjoyed it and plan on obtaining cult classics I haven't seen.,1439078400,2,145,4.615384615384615
8615369,4,B00FFPYHHM,"First, know what you are getting here. This DVD is 95% trailers of old movies about women in prison. If watching trailers from 1970s (mostly) women in prison movies sounds good to you, this is something you should like. (The remaining trailers are from the 1960s or 1980s.) If that does not sound appealing, well, stay away, go elsewhere, this is not for you. I really enjoy watching these old over-the-top trailers so I purchased this and gave it a spin. I enjoyed it. I was a little bit fearful of the unrelenting portrayals of misogyny, sexual assault, constant screams, and sadism  (none of which are a laughing matter, of course) but mostly these things are so ridiculous in their representation of such things that it is difficult to take them seriously. Be forewarned though that many people will be, and probably should be, offended by the very existence of such films. (One advantage, arguably, is that one need not actually watch the things after viewing this to get a feel for the women in prison exploitation film sub-genre.) Definitely not for the easily offended. So what's the other 5%? A humorous series of sandwiched introductions with a sexy woman dressed in comic book prison garb, a quick flashed-on-the screen intro to each trailer with date made (this is a good idea for these things!), principal people involved, and a plot synopsis, as well as an introduction to the company and a campy sort of music video thing made of clips from odd films. Why four stars and not five? What really irritated me about this DVD is two things. First, it does not have a sub-index or chapters that allow one to find individual film trailers. If there's just one you wish to show a friend and it's, for example, two thirds of the way through the DVD, you have no choice but to fast forward through them all. The whole feature is just one big single, DVD. Secondly, there's no sub-index or list of the films covered anywhere. If it had included these, i'd give it five stars.",1436918400,9,1979,4.654285714285714
