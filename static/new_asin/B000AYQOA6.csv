2398665,5,B000AYQOA6,"Kristen Bell and Christian Campbell are perfect in the lead roles of this remake of the 1936 anti-drug propaganda film.  The songs are hilariously catchy and are reminiscent of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  If you enjoy mild to medium satire, this one's for you!",1125187200,3,264,4.844444444444444
2398666,5,B000AYQOA6,"I've seen the movie in a special screening at my cinema and i have to say, i loved it, like most of the people, who have seen it with me, did. Well, it's a musical, so you expect music and dancing, but this one has so much more...

At first, the idea of transferring the original ""Reefer Madness"" from 1936, especially a anti-drug-campaign-movie, into a musical was thrilling enough for me to take a look in it. And i wasn't disappointed.

Secondly, the cast is great, i didn't see the ""real"" musical, so I cannot say how they are on stage, but they did a very good job on screen. And Neve Campbell, whose role was originally a male role, did a very nice and good dancing and singing job.

Well, at last, the songs... they are quite catchy. I cannot say how often I saw myself humming the mary lane song (after you've seen it, you'll know what I mean ;) ).

Well, i hope the DVD will show up with some specials, like a behind-the-scenes or Making-of.

Well, to put it in a nutshell, if you like Musical-Movies, if you like movies, which take themselves not too serious, if you like having fun while watching a movie... buy it!

I'm sure, I will! :)",1124755200,11,1148,4.291666666666667

2398677,4,B000AYQOA6,"LOTS of thrills! Will make you go ""oh my gosh"" and hopefully in a good way. Outstanding cast, they all get to shine and I definitely applaud the script work for that. The movie is 90% joy. Does its best work when it's portraying the idyllic, pristine early 40's and the ""terrifying"" baked miasma/fiesta of those wicked reefer bingers. The lead Christian Campbell is ideal at both, making strides from G-rated to impish scene by scene. This really works as a musical, but you have to get used to it. One number was too campy for me, another was too preachy. But most song pieces were spot-on: like the shake shack tango (absolutely startling!), and the come-to-Jesus moment where Jimmy is invited to choose between a destiny of love or torture.

The pitches are not as perfect when they go and tie the themes into real life, which is one of the film's ambitions, you can tell. It feels like less effort was spent on realizing this. But that's only at a few spots in the movie, spots that I wish were as funny and easy to swallow as the rest of the running time. But I mean, you can't beat some of this stuff.",1483833600,,1107,4.4

2398732,5,B000AYQOA6,"Never has a movie tried so hard to entertain.  And entertain it does!  It also manages to carry a serious message amongst the technicolor, completely unsubtle, and patently absurd proceedings.

This movie is about using fear and position to spread propaganda and to marginalize opposition to the propaganda.  It uses the plot of the 1936 movie (streamlined a bit in terms of characters so that it makes more sense) as a vehicle.  Yeah, it sort of has its eras confused.  A lot of the fear mongering is red scare era, while the movie takes place in the 30's.  But it has a lot of facts straight, and a little research into some of the references here is worth the time.

It definitely rewards repeat viewings, as theres so much packed into every scene that theres no way you are going to get it all the first time around.  I love the look on Shakespeare's face when Mary and Jimmy are singing about how they haven't read the ending of Romeo and Juliette, but they're sure it turns out great!  Christian Campbell is HILARIOUS as Jimmy.  In fact, he might never be able to find other work again, he's so embedded in the role.  Kristin Bell (before she was really famous) shows off her incredible singing and dancing talents.  None of the actors take their jobs lightly.  They ham it up with purpose.  It is very similar to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but, better presented, refined and concentrated.  Alan Cummings does a great job in a myriad of roles.  Ana Gasteyer as ""wronged woman, reefer den mother"" Mae, is overblown and somehow still believable.  The only thing that might be a weakness is that it is very reminiscent of a stage show, especially the showpieces like the orgy, and ""Listen to Jesus, Jimmy"".  But, theres so much happening and the lyrics are so funny that you don't mind.

Its full of really quotable one liners, so much so that I wish more people knew about it so I could reference it more.  Like, ANYTHING Sally says is hilarious.  ""Do your children enjoy......jazz music.....""  That whole scene kills me.  I love the out of nowhere animation sequence.  Its not subtle at all, but its source isn't either.  Its a perfect midnight movie.  Enthrallingly entertaining from beginning to end.  Not remotely subtle, but filled with fantastic talents given free reign to get crazy with their parts.  Highly recommended.",1425600000,,2336,4.684729064039409

2398734,5,B000AYQOA6,"Hilarious! Perfect musical parody of an old 30's propaganda film called ""Tell Your Children"" which I think is included in this DVD's special features (If not, it's on youtube).

The acting is brilliant - Alan Cummings is SO serious and dramatic, and Kristen Bell really brings life to the dumb and demure Mary Lane.  This musical is a must see!",1398384000,,353,4.5
2398743,5,B000AYQOA6,"This is a sppf set to music on the original 1938 scarre version put out by Hearst who really haqd an issue with hemp and not marijuana itself. The thing with spoofs or farces is that they have to be done just right, otherwise it looks like bad acting or is stupid to watch.  This one is really well adaptedd, has terrific swing music.  The arrangements are absolutely outstading,  Best of all though is Kristen Bell shows extraordinary talent in musical theater.  She is a perfect 10 for dance, singing and acting.  Neve Campbell as well.  ff you liked Wings you get to see just how a talent great Steven Weber has. Ana Gesteyer is also incredible as is Alan Cumming. I still can't figure out how Amy Spannger gets herbody to move the way it does in the dance numbers, and her singing and acting is also outstanding, Some viewers might have trouble with some of the religous spoofs like Jesus dancing in a Vegas Show and Angels with legs up to their necks!  But I wouldn't call it disrepectful especially if you like Monty Python.  This wasn't a long running play which is what it was originally written for.  But as a movie where you can use a much larger orchestra and get a huge scope that exceeds what a stage allows, it's a hit.  I have seen this dvd about 7 time so far.  There's a reason it's a ""cult classic"" and it's not marijuana as a subject.  It's the acting, the singing and dancing, the music, the arrangements and the wicked way that hype is made so damn funny!",1394150400,,1476,4.366300366300366
2398744,4,B000AYQOA6,"Reefer Madness the Musicial does the only thing possible in today's political climate: It highlights the suburb idiocy of a culture that criminalizes a beneficial plant anyone can grow! Those who might complain about production quality should remember that the musical is several steps above laws prohibiting cannibis.

Steven Webber is hilarious as Jack, the hood who corrupts kids souls with the evil weed, but Christian Campbell steals the show as the naive, law abiding teenage boy whose life is ruined by Marijuana, the assassin of youth  The racism of the original films is lampooned, and Alan Cumming, the guy who plays the Speaker is in a class by himself.

2398746,5,B000AYQOA6,"This humorous take on the original ""anti-drug"" movie feels even more wacked out than the film it was based on, since it's taking pot shots (no pun intended) at all the unintentionally humorous inaccuracies from the original that was put in there to sensationalize the ""dangers"" of smoking marijuana to an earlier generation. Not that it makes this movie bad to watch, it just feels like somebody decided to make this musical adaptation more like ""the Rocky Horror Picture Show of a new generation"". If anyone needs a reason to laugh at badly-produced ""anti-drug"" presentations, this movie turns everything up to eleven. Definitely worth watching even if you're not stoned.",1386374400,,672,5.118181818181818

This was back in the days when you could actually go to a brick and mortar store and rent movies (Hollywood Video has since gone out of business, I believe). Anyway, I saw this sitting on the shelf, and it piqued my interest. I had never heard of it, but something about the box's artwork, and the ludicrous concept of turning ""Reefer Madness"" into a musical seemed really interesting to me.

Boy, was I ever glad I took a chance on this movie. I've probably seen it about a dozen times now, and it's just plain hilarious! There are incredibly catchy, well performed tunes here, like ""Mary Sunshine"", ""Listen to Jesus, Jimmy"", and ""Eat the Brownie"". Perhaps my favorite song in the movie is ""The Truth"", as it is performed at the end of the story, and it perfectly encapsulates the rather clever take that the writers utilized in criticizing the government's previous efforts to ban marijuana for shady motives. The line by Alan Cummings during this number perfectly summarizes the criticism that the producers have of the government's efforts: ""When danger's near, use their fear- the end will justify the means."" Even more than the ""marijuana scare"", I found that this message applied even more aptly to George W. Bush's personal war in the middle east.

Paired with the great songs are hilarious visuals, including people throwing piles of books onto a bonfire (for fear of knowledge), kitschy wardrobes, and Satan hanging out with Jesus in heaven's nightclub. Truly weird and wonderful, this movie is a hidden gem.",1355011200,3,1614,4.844202898550725

Even with a longer-than-expected running time, there's not a wasted moment in it.  And as is often the case with stage musicals, the supporting players often steal the show [I'm talking to you, Amy Spanger].

It's got a lot of blink-and-you'll-miss-it background action, reaction shots, and visual gags peppered throughout the whole show.

""Reefer Madness"" is absolutely one of the most entertaining movies I've seen.

It's over-the-top.  It's social commentary with hilarious twists.  It's campy, but it uses that camp and thrives off of it.  The songs are fantastically catchy (I still have ""turning all your children into hooligans and whores!"" caught in my head) and actually really, really good.  Both stars, Kristen Bell and Christian Campbell, are wonderful in their parts, each of which calls for a lot of diversity (ranging from playing perfect kids all the way to sexual, drug-using deviants, to zombies).  Both of them, particularly Bell who can also dance like I never could have imagined, have powerful singing voices that fit the musical genre very well.

It's no Academy Award Winner, but seeing as what movies are currently getting the Oscars that's more a compliment than anything else.  If you're looking for a movie to make you smile, laugh, and gawk incredulously at the screen in sheer blissful shock, ""Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical"" is just right for you.

2398777,5,B000AYQOA6,"""Reefer Madness: the Musical"" is yet another entry in the seemingly endless stream of musical remakes of existing movies. Yet, unlike other recent musical remakes, such as ""The Producers"" or ""Hairspray"", ""Reefer Madness: the Musical"" is actually better than the original, and the makers of it seem to have made an effort to hire actors who can actually sing and dance.

The original movie in question is ""Reefer Madness"" (included as an extra on this disc) a 1936 anti-marijuana propaganda movie that has such a far-fetched plot that it is absolutely hilarious. ""Reefer Madness: the Musical"" is an intentionally funny movie (and it is very funny), yet it stays remarkably close to the original, even down to reusing some of the original dialogue. The plot centers around Jimmy and Mary, two clean-cut teenagers whose lives are destroyed after they encounter the demon-weed, marijuana. Murder, insanity, cannibalism and much singing result. The songs are pretty good, and as I said before, the actors can actually sing and dance.

I am amazed that this film isn't better known. Admittedly, it was made for TV (Showtime), rather than for a cinema release, but the production quality is equivalent to that of a cinema-release movie, and I would have thought that something this bizarre would have become as big a cult classic as the original movie.

Being the uber Kristen Bell fan I am, I was still wary of buying this...until I heard a snippet from one of her numbers included. Truth be told, each and every song is fun, catchy, and just all around good. Yes, I'll always say K. Bell's songs are better, but in all honesty they are. She has an amazing voice that I would've never given her credit for and it's displayed wonderfully throughout Reefer Madness. Everyone involved, however, has a good voice. The other lead, Christian Campbell (Neve's brother), has a really great voice, also put to good use with his bountiful amount of songs.

The premise of Reefer Madness is widely known. Basically a propaganda film to keep people away from marijuana, the campiness is at an all-time high. However, this time around we see Alan Cumming holding a PTA meeting...the topic? The dastardly new drug, MARIJUANA. His way of communicating the effects of the drug is through a film. This is where we meet Jimmy and Mary. Yadda yadda yadda, things happen, songs are sung, and you're likely saying, ""Hm, this is a great movie.""

I'm a big fan of hers from her U.S. TV show `Veronica Mars' and wanted to

see her other roles, so if you reading this review because of the same reason,

I can tell you this, you do see a different side to her. If you don't know

who she is, you should find out by buying the 1st Season of Veronica Mars, TOTALLY EXCELLENT!!

Back to topic...the film is basically a Mickey-take (remake also) on the propaganda movies of the 50's. This one set in an average American town and their visited by Government agent; Alan Cummings (what a pain, more later) and told of the evils of Marihuana. There are various song and dance routines along the way. Kristen apparently reprising her role from the stage show where she plays the towns Sandra Dee and who's boyfriend becomes addicted to the aforementioned drug, every scene is OTT, in the happy faces and tripping when under the influence (especially Kristen in a black outfit). Neve `Scream` Campbell has a small singing cameo as a waitress, but it's that Alan Cummings (I told you), he's so irritating that when ever he`s on I just had to forward past him.

The film is definitely an acquired taste, as not everyone is going to enjoy it; it has a kind of Grease (kids in school), Rocky horror (quirky songs and imagery) mix to it with out being anywhere near  as good as either; the song and dance routines are entertaining, but the humour sort of went over my head, I'm either to young, don't get American humour, or it just wasn't funny.

But the structure is wonderful, the acting and singing and dancing are great, the costumes are fun to look at, the choreography is brilliant, the sets are amazing, the dialogue is clever and memorable, and the music sticks with you.  Both Christian Campbell and Kristin Bell turn in stellar performances as Jimmy and Mary, the star-crossed lovers who want to be just like Romeo and Juliet because neither one of them has bothered to read the ending of the play.  Amy Spanger manages to combine dancing that runs the gamut from Buzby Berkley to Bollywood extravaganza with physical comedy in the tradition of Carol Burnett.  At one point, she delivers a seductive line to Jimmy, then turns and walks straight into a wall; at another, she has multiple collisions with a wall and John Kassir.  John Kassir is great as Ralph, who grows crazier and crazier as the plot progresses.  Steven Weber sheds the nice guy image (think Brian from Wings) as Jack, a pusher so evil that we think he doesn't have a heart until Mae (Ana Gasteyer) proves otherwise.  Alan Cumming is brilliant as the lecturer.  And the lecture audience delivers perfect reactions throughout.  This film has everything -- satire with a satyr, zombies, cannibalism, a lethal hoe, and even Jesus (Robert Torti), who says just what you'd expect him to if he were to appear in Vegas.

I had just finished the first 2 seasons of Veronica Mars on DVD, a very surprisingly good show, starring Kristen Bell.  In checking out her IMDb, I saw she had done something called ""Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical.""  A few weeks went by and eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I ordered it.  I had some friends over that night and we all watched it.  WOW.  We were blown away.  Not only was it good, the songs were catchy, the dialogue is incredibly witty, it has so many laugh out loud moments...

I would recommend this movie to not only anyone who likes musicals and slightly taboo things, but to anyone who just wants to watch a great and underrated movie.  Slight warning:  As I said, this is slightly taboo subject matter, including a song starring Jesus, and another song with a light-hearted bondage scene.  So, if you're some kind of old prude who gets offended easily, you might want to pass and run along to your Bible study group.

As a bonus, the dvd comes with a cool and fun behind the scenes documentary and commentary!  AND the ENTIRE original ""Reefer Madness"" from 1936.  So, this DVD is really TWO movies!  Snap!

Steven Weber is excellent as always.  Talk about someone who parlayed a generic role on a second-tier sitcom into a long and diverse career!

Fans of the original musical will be happy to see much of the original cast in this movie.  If you never had the chance to see the highly-acclaimed stage show, be assured that you are getting a very similar experience.  On the plus side, a downer of a number sung by Sally's baby is deleted; I never liked it in the stage show as it was heavy-handed, awkward and out of place.

2398795,4,B000AYQOA6,"Dang, this was a FUN film! Not to be taken seriously (it parodies the ultra-serious original 1936 film), Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical is a breezy, musical romp which delights in poking fun at Bible-belt paranoia, racism, McCarthyism, and govermental big brotherism.

In a good ol' little town somewhere in mid-America, a stern lecturer (Alan Cumming) warns the town parents of the dangers of marijuana, ""the real public enemy number one."" The small town denizens are, at first, doubtful as the lecturer narrates the cautionary tale of Jimmy Harper via a film. The movie within the movie then introduces fresh-faced 16 year old Jimmy (Christian Campbell) and his high school sweetheart, the innocent, goody two shoes Mary Lane (Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars and Pulse). Then in comes the villainous pot-dealer Jack  (Steven Weber), who initially lures Jimmy away with promises of swing lessons but then succeeds in getting him hooked on the giggle sticks.

What follows is Jimmy's downward spiral into the world of addiction, sin, and jazz music. Interspersed throughout Jimmy's story are reactions of the parents watching his movie as they begin to buy what the lecturer is selling and become more and more frightened, thanks in part to the lecturer's insidious, witchhunting words. And, in the end, a thoroughly convinced and determined parental mob engages in bonfire frolics. Ahh, good times.

The deliberately hokey script and the tongue-in-cheek tone never let you take the film too seriously, while the cast's exuberant, campy, twinkle-in-the-eye performances are clear cut indications that they're having fun making this movie. To me, the breakaway star is Alan Cumming, who not only plays the cold, holier-than-thou lecturer, but also several transitional characters in Jimmy's film. Alan's American accent is flawless, with nary a hint of his Scottish leanings. A stellar turn by him.

Older than 16 Christian Campbell, the cute Kristen Bell, Robert Torti (who plays Jesus, but not Jack Stone here), and John Kassir all reprise their stage roles and are wonderful. Amy Spanger (who resembles Jean Harlow here) is a good sport as she plays the slut Sally, while Ana Gesteyer puts in a layered effort as May, the dope dealer's much abused dame. Steven Weber is appropriately creepy as Jack Stone, the dastardly weedmonger. I wish, though, that Neve Campbell (Party of Five and Christian's little sis) had more screen time; she's only in the ""Down at the Ol' Five and Dime"" number.

The special features include ""Grass Roots"" (a behind the scenes featurette), the original 1936 B&W film, the fun and funny film commentary by Director Andy Fickman, the producers, and cast members Christian Campbell and Amy Spanger, a photo gallery, and cast bios.

There are no dance doubles or lip synching done here. The cast all do their own hoofing and warbling, with varying degrees of success. Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell have great chemistry when they're dueting. Ana Gasteyer has a very nice voice. The over the top musical numbers vary from ho-hum to decent to show-stoppingly stunning. Standouts are the title song ""Reefer Madness,"" the bubbly ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Down at the Ol' Five and Dime"" (kind of an homage to Good News), and another Jimmy and Mary duet ""Loved By Mary Lane"" (which the cast laughingly describes as the ""whitest, whitest people on earth"" doing Apollo theatre).

But my two favorite numbers are the tasteless but hilarious animated Brownie song (in which Jimmy humps a brownie) and the very sacrilegious but, again, hilarious ""Listen to Jesus, Jimmy,"" in which a Jesus gone Vegas tries in vain to get Jimmy to mend his ways. The lyrics are awful, yet I couldn't stop laughing:

""Thou shalt heed this holy omen;
stop indulging like a Roman.
All the sermons say you gotta...
trust the man with the stigmata.""",1156464000,7,3842,5.0760697305863705

He is the one fertilizing your prejudices. That film he shows you? All lies! One hit of the ""deadly reefer"" does not drive you toward insanity. It doesn't, I tell you!

Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell, PRETTY DEAD GIRL) is alive and well, I say! He lives in Humboldt County, California (or was it Berkeley), caring for his wife, Mary Lane (Kirsten Bell, VERONICA MARS) and their thirteen children.

Jack Stone (Steven Weber, WILL & GRACE) is a nice businessman. He sells pots and seeds (okay, so some of them look a bit suspicious but COME ON!) And when Mae Coleman (Ana Gasteyer, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE) yells at him, well, she deserves what she gets!

And invoking a song by Jesus! Oh, puhlllease! Is this really necessary? I touched ""marihuana"" once (well, maybe ten times ...this week) but that doesn't mean I need divine intervention from a Tom Jones-ish Christ figure who belts out Vegas-style songs from the cross, does it? I think not.

And what about Ralph (John Kassir, TALES FROM THE CRYPT)? That poor, misunderstood cannibal. If you leave him alone without food of course he's going to revert back to his man-eating methods. Can we really judge him so plainly?

This show is a sham, I tell you! A sham! And I won't stand for it! That lecturer is the true drug. He's the addiction. Believe him not!

2398800,2,B000AYQOA6,"Given the inexplicably high ratings given here to the musical version of REEFER MADNESS I'm sure this won't be a terribly popular review.  But I am going to try to give as honest a review as I can.  Not that I think the other reviewers are being dishonest; I merely find their positive reviews to be impossible to fathom.

The great claim to fame of REEFER MADNESS:  THE MOVIE MUSICAL is that it is the most ambitious musical ever made directly for television, having originally been an adaptation for Showtime of the Off-Broadway play.  The most compelling aspect of the film version, as I'm sure was true on stage as well, is the excellent dance numbers.  Though the film keeps a compressed, stagy blocking for the numbers, almost always restricting the dances to approximately the same amount of space that one would have on a stage (most probably they decided to keep the precise stage choreography to cut down on expenses in transferring the production to screen), each number possesses a great visual energy and is never less than completely fun to watch.  Unfortunately, the real enjoyment pretty much ends with the dances.  The songs were almost without exception almost aggressively bland and uninteresting and the book was just as awful.  I can honestly say that at no point did I come to care about any of the characters and their fate nor engage with the plot.  The problem is undoubtedly the source material.  What probably was great Off-Broadway simply does not have enough substance for a filmed version.

To be honest, I only watched this to begin with for two reasons:  first, I am a huge fan of musicals (less Broadway musicals than classic Hollywood productions) and second, I am a huge Kristen Bell fan.  Had Kristen Bell not been in this, I certainly wouldn't have watched it.  I consider VERONICA MARS to be one of the great, largely undiscovered gems on television, and wish nothing more than for the show's star to ge a well-deserved Emmy nomination (which won't happen, because the Emmys simply do not give nominations to low-rated shows on UPN).  I knew that Bell had a musical theater background and had seen her perform ""Fame"" on the 2005 Emmy special, and wanted to see what she could do here.  She dances quite well, though all of her numbers were more on the kinetic side.  In a different age in Hollywood she would be an extraordinarily prized performer, a capable dramatic actress who is equally capable of comedy, dancing, and singing.  Imagine what RKO or Warner's would have made of her in the thirties or MGM after that.  As it is, we live in an age where a multi-talented individual such as Kristen Bell (much like Hugh Jackman) gets little or no opportunity to draw on all of her talents.  She also seems to be a nice singer, really soaring in the upper register.  Unfortunately, the songs were all scored in a range a bit lower than where her voice was strongest.  All in all I enjoyed seeing her in the film, though the script and the songs were so weak that the only joy was in seeing that she could in fact sing and dance.

Most of the other performers were rather lackluster, except for Alan Cumming, who shines in a variety of roles.  Several of the performers reprised roles that they undertook in the original stage production, including Kristen Bell, Christian Campbell, and John Kassir.  There are also a host of minor characters whose faces are familiar from TV and film.  It is not at all a bad cast and might have excelled better with a stronger script and set of songs.

I don't know how to account for the very good reviews this film is getting.  I know a good film when I see it, and this ain't that.  Its badness is, in fact, palpable.  I can only venture that some people see it as a cult film in the making, much as the original (and so-awful-it-is-almost-but-not-quite-good) REEFER MADNESS.  As a non-pot smoker (though I do think it should be legalized, since it clearly is less dangerous than alcohol--I heard Willie Nelson on Terry Gross the other day say that pot could be good for society, since there is so much stress and pot-smoking could alleviate some of that--I'm not sure he is wrong), maybe I'm failing to pick up on some political bandwagon driving the good reviews.

Then, about a year ago, showtime started running this new version, and I fell in love!!  We've had the DVD for about 2 weeks, and we've watched it 5 times already.  I think it's great that there are so many celebrities involved in the project, and the creativity is out of this world.

2398810,5,B000AYQOA6,"I will let you see the other excellent reviews for this film for a synopsis of the plot.  I just wanted to add an ""amen"" to the people who appreciated this terrifically funny film for what it is--and to add:

Don't forget the bonus features that are part of this DVD.  If you haven't seen the 1936 original, it is there in full and worth a look.  You'll see that the musical is, surprisingly, not much more campy and ""over the top"" than the bit of 1936 stupidity that inspired it.  In fact, the original just BEGGED to be parodied.  Three cheers to the writers, producers and cast (of stage and screen) who took it on and did such a terrific job!

And please don't forget to view the ""Grass Roots"" feature in the bonus material.  In it you will learn how the original RM sprang into being after 3 American corporate giants (Hurst, DuPont and Mellon) conspired to link the harmless hemp industy to the ""demon narcotic"" marijuana (or marihuana, if you prefer) and create a nationwide scare about it so as to eliminate the profits hemp would cost them:  paper production (Hurst), fabric manufacturing (DuPont) and profits for all three (Mellon was the banker for Hurst and DuPont).  So together, the put together efforts to pass legislation to make hemp illegal to further their own interests at the economical--and some might say emotional--expense of the rest of Americans.  (HMMM  The more things change....)

Oh, and I can't say enough about all the brilliant performances.  (The casting crew need a cheer all their own.)  I was actually entranced by the dance routine performed by Neve Campbell and Jim Weber.  If you check out the bonus features, you learn that this dance was actually made illegal in the USA because of the number of dancers who literally broke their necks trying to perform it.  If you see it, you'll have no trouble believing that.

This movie is also a very timely wake-up call about the dangers of complaisance and blind acceptance of government ""spin.""  And it entertains you and makes you laugh at the same time.  If that doesn't constitute a total package, I don't know what does.",1137974400,6,2108,4.676630434782608
2398811,5,B000AYQOA6,"That's exactly what the DVD box smells like.  Well, that's what everyone's telling me.  To me, it smells like vanilla.  I guess that's because I personally do not know what chocolate smells like.

Anyways, this movie is such a riot.  I first heard about it when it was going to premiere on Showtime last April.  So, I made an appoinment to watch.  I had a blank VHS tape in the VCR set and ready, because even though I didn't really know what it was about, I wanted to record it.  And I'm so glad I did.

The stand out songs to me are:

Reefer Madness

""Deadly as the Deomcrats/it empties out the stores/Turnin' all our children into hooligans and whores""

Romeo & Juliet (mainly for the fact that Jimmy and Mary hadn't finished reading the play and their assumptions about the ending are WAY off)

""We are just like Romeo and Juliet/We're happy young and bubblin' with love/I can't wait to read the ending!/I can't either!/But I'm sure it turns out real swell/I bet Romeo marries his Juliet/They have a baby/And makes lots of friends/That's probably the way the play ends""

Down At the Ol' Five and Dime

""After school is let out/we just like to get out/To the place where Jitter Buggin's always in style""

The Orgy (Amy Spanger is stunning in her skimpy outfit [drool] and Alan Cumming ain't that bad looking either)

""Tender virgin/fresh as morning dew/I've been eagerly expecting you""

The Brownie Song (this one is hilarious and so is the animation)

""This brownie/is yummy/It's the greatest brownie known to man/It's chewy/it's nutty/This brownie's really good!/Don't offer me a macaroon/my brownie suits me fine/There's frosting on the top/and best of all it's mine""

Little Mary Sunshine ([drool] over Kristen Bell)

""Little Mary Sunshine/with her hem cut so low/Little Mary Sunshine/with her ducks in a row""

Murder

""Open the gate and abandon hope/We're the ghosts of the kids that got hooked on dope/Way down where it's hot/they are saving us a spot/You murdered them Ralph/Murdered them/murdered them/Murdered them/murdered them""

Tell 'Em the Truth (this is my personal favorite)

""The tragic victim of drug abuse/has now been spared for a higher use/They were ready to cook my goose/But God had other plans""

I love this movie because it's not saying ""Marijuana is stupid"" or ""You shouldn't do drugs"".  It's just a satire on an old classic which did say those things.

If you're personally offended at drug jokes, Jewish or black jokes, or Catholic jokes (which the song Listen to Jesus, Jimmy is), then I'd recommend watching something else.  If you have a very open mind, then watch it.",1136592000,3,2602,4.836734693877551
2398812,5,B000AYQOA6,"This is a movie that you want to share with friends.  One great funny line follows another, the cast gets to show off their singing and dancing talents, which are considerable.  The songs are memorable.  The DVD case smells like a chocolate chip cookie.  What more can you ask for?

The movie is structured as a film within a film. Parents of local high school students attend a special screening of an anti-marijuana propoganda movie (entitled ""Tell Your Children"") with a lecture from a representative of William Randolph Hearst, played by Alan Cumming.  As ""Tell Your Children"" progresses and those who question the various holes in logic are threatened and humiliated by the lecturer, the parents slowly become xenophobic -- shooting accusing glances at an Asian woman attending the screening, for example.

A previous review stated that this movie is making fun of those ""innocent"" time when people knew dance steps.  In point of fact this movie is making fun of those who would divide society by creating a culture of fear, even when there isn't much danger.

The last lines of the movie illustrate this:

{SPOILER ALERT! BUT THIS MOVIE IS GREAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW THE ENDING!}

""And when the reefer has been destroyed/ We'll go after Darwin and Sigmund Freud/ And sex depicted on celluloid/ And Communists and freaks!""

""When danger's near/exploit their fear!""

However, it went on a little too long.  And near the end, when this film strays too far from the original film, it becomes too determined to go over-the-top.  The canibalism and murder scene are both excessively bloody.  I'm not against gore, but by that time I was bored anyway and all that blood kind of put me off.  And in the end, the film is trying to take itself too seriously by throwing in a clumsy message about censorship and mob rule.

Still worth seeing.",1133136000,3,676,4.4227642276422765
2398815,5,B000AYQOA6,"that's right you read right. this new musical production of the old '30's film is as high camp and memorably musical as that cult stronghold.
i dare say if theaters still engaged in the loveable 'midnight movies' institution that was a staple in the 70's, they'd be lining up and down the block to get in and see this s a l a m dunk!
high camp....great songs and choreography sharp and delightful.
acting chops by all involved are very very high as well.
for many an evening of fun and laughter buy this DVD. you can not possibly digest it all in one sitting.",1132444800,3,559,4.333333333333333

2398817,5,B000AYQOA6,"""Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical"" is a meta-musical, because unlike ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" it works best based upon your knowledge of the original cinematic text, anti-drug propaganda, and certain aspects of 20th century American history.  In the 1936 film ""Reefer Madness"" a school principal tells a group of parents the cautionary tale of two high school kids, Bill Harper and Mary Lane, who attend a party at the apartment of shady adults Jack and Mae where joints are given away free to get the kids hooked.  Mary's kid brother Jimmy runs somebody down high on weed and Jack ends up framing Bill for shooting Mary.

For ""Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical"" the story remains basically the same, although now the Bill and Jimmy are combined so the kid in trouble is now Jimmy ""the Cannibis Killer"" Harper (Christian Campbell), which is an economical change.  But the more significant change is that instead of an academic figure the lecture is now given by a person (Alan Cumming) with obvious but unnamed connections to the forces of government who are overly concerned with the need for vigilance.  Although much is made of William Randolph Heart's efforts to stomp our marijuana because hemp producers threatened his logging interests, the lecturer is decidedly a figure of the 1950s in terms of fear mongering, casting aspirations regarding patriotism, and emphasizing decency.  One of the best elements in the film's satire has an audience member taking exception to some wild claim that the lecturer has made.  But every time Mr. Kochinski (Stephen E. Miller) finds something far fetched, the lecturer hits back by quoting cold hard ""facts"" from Heart's newspaper.

For me the part where I knew that creators Kevin Murjphy and Dan Studney were cooking with grass in this one was when they took the scene from early in the original, where Jimmy and Mary are doing their adolescent take on some lines from ""Romeo & Juliet,"" and turn it into a running joke because Mary (Kristin Bell) is a blonde this time, which means she does not know it is a tragedy and keeps hoping that she and Jimmy end up with the same sort of happy ending Shakespeare wrote about (Jimmy assures her they have six kids).  Bell provides the standout performance in the musical, which surprised me a bit because she was so lackluster at the Emmy Awards this year.  No wonder they make sure her character is around for the big finish even though she is dead (being happy but hemorrhaging blood will do that to you).

Overall the production numbers are better than the songs, which means you will be more interested in watching ""Listen to Jesus, Jimmy"" or ""Little Mary Sunshine"" over and over again than in singing along (there are not subtitles for the DVD but you can turn on close captioning to get the lyrics if you insist on doing so).  Beyond the two leads, both of whom are reprising their original off-Broadway roles, the rest of the cast gets to pop up in supporting roles throughout the show, so keep an eye out for that.  The cast includes Steven Weber as Jack, Ana Gasteyer as Mae, John Kassir as Ralph (the piano player who laughs maniacally at the drop of a hat), Amy Spanger as Sally (""She fell down!""), Christian's kid sister Neve Campbell as Miss Poppy, and Robert Torti as Jesus.  Kassir and Torti are the other two original cast members (although the other roles played by Torti are now done by Weber).

The original ""Reefer Madness"" is included on this DVD, so you can (re)familiarize yourself with the source material (I had already rented the original on a DVD that also included ""Marijuana"" and ""Assassin of Youth,"" but I appreciate the effort).  There is also SHOWTIME's short featurette on the history of the musical and the cable version, and a commentary track with directory Andy Rickman, producers Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, and cast members Christian Campbell and Amy Spanger.  Throw in the requisite Cast Biographies, Photo Gallery, and Coming Soon trailers for more SHOWTIME original movies and programming.  Be aware that the CD out there is for the off-Broadway show and not the soundtrack for this version.",1131753600,53,4131,4.827195467422096
2398818,4,B000AYQOA6,"This is currently my favorite musical comedy. All of the songs are really catchy. It is perhaps the most quoteable movie you will ever see. It is loosely based off a 1930's propaganda film of the same name.

A lot of this movie revolves around exaggerating the effects of marijuana (reefer) to the point that its more like cocaine or LSD. The film is basically about Jimmy Harper, all American boy of the 1930's, a ""real credit to the community"" until local reefer-man Jack tricks him into trying reefer. After one stick his life quickly tumbles down hill. At the climax of the film, he barely escapes electrocution by the state.

Towards the end of and immediately after the song ""Murdered Me"" there are some gory parts with some obviously fake body parts (a friend of mine doesn't like this part of the movie at all and always covers her eyes.) This part is too gory for younger viewers.

Here are some of my favorite quotes
""What a night! I was in more laps than a napkin""-Sally
""Jimmy what are you doing here in the middle of the night! It's almost 9 P.M.""- Mary
""Ralph's wound up like an eight-day clock. One too many gigglesticks""-Mae
""Children smoke a reefer stick, thinking it to be an ordinary perfectly harmless cigarette, the kind we all used to enjoy as teenagers.""-Narrator
""Jack! I saw satan... and the kid... and satan and the girl... and satan!""-Ralph
""This place needs a going over. It looks like the marines have landed.""-Jack
""Mary Sunshine! You're ultra-ultra!!!""-Ralph
Of course, these lines are much better in context performed by actors. Anyway, these lines just scratch the surface.

Reasons to watch this movie
1) Great acting and overacting (stage acting)
2) Great dialog
3) Great musical numbers
4) perfect timing and deliverance of lines
5) Great satire and commentary for those paying deeper attention
6) Good editing

Also fun to note, many of the more outrageous lines in the movie about marijuana are quotes or paraphase from the newspapers of the 1930's. (for example, ""Marijuana posesses an addictive power beyond even that of heroine or cocaine."")

The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras (some of the extras were shown on showtime to promote the movie), but it is well worth the price, or at least a rental. The extras include behind the scenes cast interviews (originally a showtime promotion for the movie), the original reefer madness (also shown on showtime. The restored color version of the original is more interesting to watch), cast biographies, during the film cast commentary (not that good), and a very short photo gallery (perhaps 20 pictures).

Overall, a very funny movie that is worth at least a few viewings.",1131753600,7,2669,4.827133479212254
2398819,5,B000AYQOA6,"Reefer Madess - the musical is great. It's better than the original (though really different) It's a funny satire of America's present and past. The great cast provide excellent singing (after all they're actors)

So much to like about this orignal and inventive spin on an American classic.",1131667200,7,291,5.0625
2398820,5,B000AYQOA6,"This past spring I watched this on Showtime and I wasn't dissapointed. When it was good it was great! I wanted the DVD but then I found out it wouldn't be released on DVD until November. I had to wait about seven months!
I don't recommend this as a total substitution for the original...more like an add on pack.

For me the best parts were the 5 way chant,
""Listen To Jesus Jimmy""
and ""Shakespeare""

The movie is purposely campy,which makes it hilarious. It should have been shorter though. (I think about thirty minutes should have been trimmed off before it's initial Showtime release.)

Final/Parting Thoughts:Give it a chance (the DVD),it's very funny and memorable at points despite it's long running time.",1131580800,5,712,4.819672131147541
2398821,5,B000AYQOA6,"Okay, the original ""Reefer Madness"" film has been a cult hit forever, so when there was a musical produced, it only made sense that sometime, somewhere, someone would make a movie version of Reefer Madness the Musical.  And let me just say that Showtime completely knocked it out the park.  Everything about this film is absolutely perfect.  Well, not everything, to be honest, if you were stoned there is no way you could possibly sit through the entire thing.  It's two hour running time begins to get old around an hour and 15 minutes, but that is more than remedied with the epic zombie filled ending.  Yes, that's right, I said zombies.

Honestly, if you are reading this review, it means you are at least somewhat interested in this DVD and if you're somewhat interested you really need to buy it.  Whether you watch it all at once or in specific segments, it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years.  It's definitely the best musical since South Park the Movie, and it's probably the best made for TV movie ever.

And I cannot say enough about how good Alan Cumming is in this movie.  His performance is pure brilliance and must be seen to be believed.  This movie is great!",1131321600,7,1190,4.539906103286385
2398822,5,B000AYQOA6,"I'm impatiently awaiting the arrival of this DVD. We've played our videotape of this movie over and over -- you wind up playing it as you would an album. The folks at Showtime are NUTS, not to mention cruel, if they don't release the soundtrack. (The cast recording from the play just isn't as good as the movie score.)

Each time you watch this movie, you uncover more tiny gems. Notice, for example, just before Jimmy is about to perform some heroic action, the way he squares his shoulders in a ""superhero to the rescue"" move. Barely perceptible, but it's a hoot. All the actors in this version are excellent -- it would be unfair to single out any one performance as the best. I can't even choose a favorite song.

Beyond the killer music, writing, and performances, this movie makes a statement that is (unfortunately) very relevant right now. Alan Cumming's narrator sings at the end: ""When danger's near, exploit their fear..."" Hm, sound like anything happening in your world today? By the way, this musical is NOT just for weed-lovers; I haven't smoked pot in over 25 years. Anyone who finds the movie merely a silly dig at those who disapprove of pot is missing a much more important statement.

2398823,5,B000AYQOA6,"OK, confession time here..... In 1988, I went to Drew University in NJ with both Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, the writers of the original play as well as the film musical.

I actually missed most of my Senior Formal (Think Senior Prom for College) since I was in a Musical they worked on called Valley of the Kings which had a performance the same night(Think of a tongue in cheek musical of Raiders of the Lost Ark).  I think I had the smallest part in the play as part of the protagonist's crew.  Kevin is now a writer on Desperate Housewives, after stints doing the Weird Science TV show and a bunch of other shows (Success AND getting to go to work with Vanessa Angel... somebody is cashing in some serious Karma.

Now that the background is out of the way, go get this DVD.  Their sarcastic wit gets shown to full effect, and the performances are outstanding.  You'll be humming the tunes for days afterwards.  It's way over the top camp, the kind that folks weaned on day trips to Greenwich Village would dream up.

They also caught lightning in a bottle with the casting.  Cumming hams it up even more than he did in Cabaret (or even Spy Kids.... OK, small joke there).  Weber lets out his Snidely Whiplash, and Ana Gasteyer overacts in a perfect caricature of all those abused film noir housewives from the old days.  Kristin Bell (yes, in an S&M outfit for those so inclined) later went on to Veronica Mars fame and plays the Sandra Dee part to the hilt.

Bottom line, go get this DVD.",1130284800,7,1495,4.416058394160584

This movie is fan-tas-tic.  The songs are great, the actors are great, and I just love the costumes.  The dance numbers are all very good, but not quite as dazzling as I would have liked.  Mainly, this movie is here for a good laugh.  Listen to the lyrics of the songs- they are very funny and inteligent.  Oh yes, and if you think Kristen Bell is hot, you get to see her in full S&M costume.  So buy the movie now.",1129420800,2,584,4.151785714285714

The show keeps the 2 time periods so well defined. It is like Grease meets Weeds.  The first time I saw this movie I was totally hooked!!  You have to love this film for the art that it is!
The dvd extras are not to be missed. They give a special insite to the film from all aspects from cast to big wigs. learning all the cool historic reference makes this movie that much more special.

The story line is pretty similar to the original, which shows you how ridiculous the original was! I cannot count the times I have had one or more of the songs stuck in my head.  This satire is so funny, with good choreography and WONDERFUL music.  The lyrics are to die for!  A movie that includes singing oysters, seductive brownies, and ""Romeo AND Juliet"" is one that should be included in any collection!  It sounds a little bizarre, and it is, but it's so worth watching. It's also a bit raunchy (there isn't a song called ""The Orgy"" for nothing), so I wouldn't watch it with kids (or parents).",1126915200,8,776,4.317241379310345
