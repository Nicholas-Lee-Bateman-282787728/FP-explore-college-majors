8221567,4,B00005QCW7,"Being a true fan of Mr. Rollins, I was excited to see that he released a current Spoken Word performance during his stint at London's Astoria Theatre this year.
Rollins delivers all of the usual and funny life stories of his worldwide traveling adventures: What makes his routine so hilarious is it's his real experiences and not written stand-up material.  Mr. Rollins is not afraid to reveal and express his feelings about people he has encountered such as the time he was hit on by a man in a foreign country; techno music and untalented bands; eye for the opposite sex and masturbation.
While this particular show captures all of Mr. Rollins'essence, it seems to be geared towards foreign audiences which is probably explained by its filming in London. I think US fans would appreciate his other tape, ""You Saw Me Up There"" that was filmed at the El Rey Theatre in L.A. much more.  This tape does contain a bonus 30 minute in-depth commentary/interview with Hank that's very interesting (for this alone makes this purchase worthwhile).  The interview ranges on such topics as Hank's opinions on women, relationships, breeding, age, and music--a must see for any true Rollins fan.
If new to Mr. Rollins' spoken performances, I suggest you purchase his other tape first (You Saw Me Up There) before purchasing this tape.
NOTE:  Missing from this video is his new music video for the song ""Your Number Is One,"" and a documentary on the making and release of his new CD, which are listed on the package.",1008460800,4,1503,4.7915057915057915
