You can kick back, relax to the fractals, and chill to the music.  The quality of the DVD itself looks like something you'd get off a store shelf.  Kind of hard to imagine that mass produced titles and ""burn on demand"" discs have become almost indistinguishable from one another.  This is a great way to infuse history and math into entertainment that could also be used in schools of all sorts.

Please be sure to buy my DVDs from my Amazon links. You'll pay a fair price, they handle all the details, including on-demand disc creation, and you keep scammers from ripping you off. Also, I no longer operate as ""All Fract Up"". Nor do I control my former web site of the same name. If you are doing business with whomever controls it now please be careful.",1488758400,,880,4.434782608695652
