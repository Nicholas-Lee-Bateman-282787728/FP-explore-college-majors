Because Amazon's description said only ""DVD"" and did not indicate this item was for the European viewers only, I ordered it.

Having watched part of it on PBS, I looked forward to having my own copy, only to find out I couldn't play it.

Now, I apparently have to return it to the UK, paying postage for what I consider an Amazon error.

Very disappointed in Amazon.  They're usually better than this.",1379462400,,417,4.581081081081081
