8166665,5,B000059S0C,"This is a great video of Phil Keaggy in the prime of his career.  He had just released ""Beyond Nature"", his 1991 acoustic album, that year.  This video is an instructional video, but is very entertaining to watch through for fun as well.  I bought this on VHS, and it didn't contain the instruction booklet, which would have been fairly useful in learning some of the songs.  I found a PDF file of the booklet much later, and it only contained 4 or 5 songs of the 12 that are on the video, so I don't think it's an imperative thing to have.  However, most of the material is very difficult to see and just do, so if you do have an opportunity to get the booklet, go for it.  It will be somewhat helpful.  Phil plays all of the songs from beginning to end, so he's not just showing tips (he does show tips on the end of some of the songs though).  Therefore, it is easy to sit down and watch through even if you're not a guitarist and just want it for entertainment.  Phil also talks about his guitars and the rack he's using.  It's a really good video and I highly recommend it.  Also, don't forget the companion video: Phil Keaggy Electric Guitar Style.",1420502400,,1154,4.247706422018348
