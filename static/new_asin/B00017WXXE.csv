1975761,3,B00017WXXE,More of an ad for train layouts than a guide in aiding design of a new layout.  How to design inclines and include them in planning a new layout should be in this (at least Part2),1385424000,,179,3.9722222222222223
1975762,5,B00017WXXE,"So many helpful tips, if you are building a small layout or an intire room, this book has lots of useful ideas.  Expecally if you are using older parts bought off on line auctions",1375660800,,179,4.264705882352941

1975765,5,B00017WXXE,It makes me cry to look at these Parts. I had soooo many Lionel Trains as a child. So it gives me GREAT JOY to watch these parts. I really enjoy them.,1342483200,,150,3.71875
1975766,4,B00017WXXE,I am a fan of Tom McCombas's collection of Lionel and toy train videos.  This one is a bit dry because the interviews become lengthy with some weird edits.  Primarily bought it for my son's obsession with toy trains but ended up enjoying more for myself.  If you are fascinated by toy trains and their collectors this is a good see.,1326844800,,332,4.409836065573771
1975767,3,B00017WXXE,The DVD was good in that it showed that there are some extreme layouts out there.  I was a little disappointed in that it didn't show how they were built/ constructed.,1295827200,2,167,4.387096774193548
1975768,5,B00017WXXE,This was a gift to my husband the train geek.  He loved it.  One of his favorite gifts.,1265500800,2,87,3.7777777777777777
1975769,5,B00017WXXE,"I'm sure I can not top previous reviews, but I have watched and re watched this DVD more than any other DVD I have rented or now own.

If this video doesn't inspire you to start buying some of those old Lionel trains we had as Kids nothing will.

Lionel would be proud of me ! I have bought 3 books on collecting and spent atleast $1000.00 in the last month buying some of those old Lionel Train keepsakes and more.

I'm now planning my own railroad since watching the video and I am also trying to find a local 3 rail club. Hopefully one exists in Central California.

You wil enjoy this video! I'm now looking for another copy to share with a friend.

I have found Amazon a great place to look for what you want.",1223510400,13,714,4.144927536231884
