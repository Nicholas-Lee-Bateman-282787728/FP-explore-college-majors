1094849,5,6305943389,"This series was the template that Paul Dini and Bruce Timm used to create both the Batman and Superman animated series for Warner Brothers TV.  The Fleischer Brothers' creation has a minimalist look than compared to the muscular development that was prevalent in the comic books at the time.  But this version set the standard for character animation that has been used by almost every studio since. Their excellent perception of depth was another innovation.  The Fleischers' actually shot the shorts in the same way that directors would shoot movies with backlight and shadows.  Imagine what they could've done with Batman.  Highly recommended for all fans of Batman: The Animated Series, Superman or Batman Beyond.",973728000,5,717,5.2

So to add their LOGO over the picture on the bottom right of the screen is something no film collector would ever do. It's like if I were selling ""prints"" of Van Gogh but put my name in the right corner of every painting! No respect for art here! This shouldn't be called a ""collectors edition"" as the original presentation has been horribly altered to endlessly advertise the name of GAIMA company superimposed on the lower right corner of the screen. YUCK!!!!!This company advertises their streaming service at the start of the disc. I would never do business with GAIAM as they have no concept of preserving art. Don't be me and listen to all the reviews!!!If you want these treasures on Bluray they come in the Warner Bros. Ultimate Superman Boxed set!

1095400,1,6305943389,"This review refers to the Gaiam blu-ray edition, and only to the Gaiam blu-ray edition.

Avoid this blu-ray. It is poorly upscaled from standard DVD, waxy-looking and pixelated because of too much digital clean-up. It's also too bright, eliminating the film-noirish nighttime atmosphere of the cartoons. Worse, the Gaiam logo is permanently burned in on the lower right-corner of the image. The logo is big and noticeable and can't be removed. So you have to look at ""Gaiam"" throughout each cartoon. There are many cheap public-domain editions of Fleischer's Superman cartoons it's easy to buy the wrong one. This is the worst. Don't buy this edition.

Instead, buy the latest hi-def restorations authorized by DC Comics and released by Warner Home Video on DVD. It states ""DC Comics"" and ""Authorized Edition from Original Masters"" on the cover. Alternatively, there is also the first digital restoration released by Image / Bosco in 2000, but DC / Warner DVD is the sharpest with the best color. Both editions are sold by amazon:

While the commemorative booklet it comes with is nice, and the presentation even on the disc itself is pretty fantastic, the product itself is sorely off.

The digital upscale took me a little bit to get used to, which I once I did I actually kind of like. It however is not a restored version, just upscaled digitally.

Finally, a good half and I would hazard to say most episodes the sound does not sync correctly with the picture. In some it is a fraction of a second, others a full second. Then there's the very last episode where it is almost a full 3 second delay with picture coming AFTER sound.

1. all episodes show a jagged digital distortion. No good. I missed this in any reviews about the quality.
2. The sound is not sinc'd on most episodes, with dialogue not aligned with the action or characters mouth moves,ends

1095746,5,6305943389,"Most of the negative reviews revolve around 2 issues: the IDIOTIC ""Gaiam"" logo that is permanently displayed throughout the episodes and the soundtrack being off. Both points are well taken and fair. My perspective is that 99% of the enjoyment of this series is in the spectacular animation and here there is no doubt this BD comes thru. The art deco style, the rich, vibrant colors are simply amazing to behold. The quality of the prints is excellent as well. The logo I can pretty much ignore although I certainly wish it was not there. The sound is not off on all the episodes, it seems more pronounced on the second disc. The sound on the first disc is better and on some episodes such as ""The Arctic Giant"" is spot on. Frankly, you can watch these animation masterpieces while listening to music and still enjoy the eye-popping artwork. For fans of vintage, hand-drawn animation this BD is a must-have. They are in the public domain and most are on YT in 480p uploads so go there and see for yourself. For me, $20 for this package was well spent",1431820800,2,1050,4.531578947368421

However, being the ""best"" available collection is not quite saying much. I believe that this volume offers the best available visual transfers to date, but it's highly obvious flaws keep this set from being far from excellent. What pisses me off is that even the previous mother company Warner Brothers couldn't get it 'right' the last time around. Enter GAIAM (Gay-I-Am ??? ... is there something 'hidden' here ??). Just who the Hell is/are GAIAM and how did this completely unknown entity gain possession of these beautiful, classic cartoons?? Although the visual presentations, packaging, 2-Disc HD and booklet are by far the best production to date ... as a SERIOUS COLLECTOR, what sets me completely on fire is that (for some ungodly and unknown reason) this company chose to emblazon their large distracting corporate LOGO WATERMARK throughout every frame of every cartoon presentation in this collection ... completely unacceptable and annoying in every possible way! But wait ... there's more! The company decided to toy with the sound by adding their own effects/distortion to the existing soundtracks. Although somewhat cleverly attempted, they merely managed to seriously screw up several of the cartoons by losing sync and those delays are horrendous!! Did anyone at GAIAM preview or edit this production??? This collection could have easily garnered a 5-Star Rating, but because of these major ignored and unattended oversights ... I can only offer 3-Stars. Again, not all of the cartoons are as flawed with sound-sync, but I'll have to say that this is possibly the best visual presentation to date (that is, if you can ignore, mentally or physically block out the hideous company LOGO (constantly at the bottom right of the screen).

Of all the blu-rays I have purchased, THIS one--which was one of the more expen$ive ones I spent my hard-earned money on--is the most sloppy, lackluster remastering I've ever seen!  I wanted to return it so badly, but unfortunately most media stores don't refund discs that have already been opened.

The company that's responsible for this disgrace, ""GAIAM"", has their stupid, DISTRACTING logo pasted on the lower right of the screen during all the episodes.  Not only that, but the audio is WAY off--like several seconds off--to the point where you don't hear the characters talking until AFTER they've shut their mouths.  In the second episode Louis sounded like Clark at one part!  I do, however, praise the more rich colors in the blu-ray, but the fact that it looks like it was remastered on video (you can see the digital lines going across the screen) completely cancels out that positive aspect in my opinion. They even got the order of the episodes wrong on the disc compared to the air dates and what's listed in the booklet!

The only aspect of this set I do like is the detailed booklet that came with it.  I might hold on to that and take the discs themselves to the pawn shop in an attempt to recover [some of] my losses.  At least keeping the booklet will help make it somewhat worth it.  I'm just thankful that I realized this travesty BEFORE I parted with my older DVDs of this cartoon.

I think GAIAM needs to stick to their specialty of TV streaming--which I shudder to think how AWFUL that must be--and leave the remastering of iconic shows to those who are a little more in touch with consumer quality. >:-(",1378425600,7,1774,4.635782747603834

1096126,5,6305943389,"This DVD is one of the most treasured in my collection.  I bought the original 2-VHS collection mastered by Bosko Video.  An excellent collection of World War Two era animated adventures of the man of steel, with crisp sound and rich colors, this disc is a magnificent library of the original man of steel animated adventures.

Every now and then I saw one, or part of one, but now Bosko has released the entire collection for all to enjoy.  Who can forget Superman battleing the mad scientists with designs on stealing wealth or wreaking revenge with their scientific know-how twisted for hate filled purposes.  Or how can anyone forget Superman fighting a thawed dinosaur frozen in time and brought to life through an unfortunate accident, or fighting fifth column operatives after Pearl Harbor.

One of the amazing things about this series is that action is kept in context.  Bullet are fired, men are shot, people are imperiled, buildings toppled, men fire full automatic weapons, things are destroyed, but it is not gratuitous, and not done for the sake of glamorizing the violence but there as a function of Superman needing to confront the foes of mankind as he defends his adopted world.

The stories are also highly inventive and straight to the point.  There's little in the way of dancing around sensitive political and emotional issues.  There are bad guys in the world, and they come in all shapes and sizes, and Superman is there to stop them.  Created by a couple of young boys who are the sons of Jewish immigrants, they pay homage to their family and values by creating a hero who, in essence, is the ultimate immigrant, and allowed to excel the American way by virtue of of truth and justice.  The original Superman story was science fiction tale about a bald mad scientist, but after suffering tragedy, the two young friends, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, created the ultimate hero who had the psychical prowess beyond any circus strongman or trapeze acrobat.  He was brave, strong, courageous, and smart with a huge heart to match his bigger than life self.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.

1096501,2,6305943389,"Where to begin with this thing? This is the Blu-Ray version of some of my favorite cartoons, the Fleischer Superman cartoons from the early 1940s. The colors are good and the cartoons are presented in the order they were released, which is all good, but they have been tampered with in ways that just, frankly, suck.

The watermark: On every cartoon there's a little bug in the lower right corner watermarking these as coming from some bizarre new-agey company called Gaiam. I bought the DVD so I don't have to see ads watermarked on the show!

The sound - new sound effects: The first problem with the sound is that, incredibly and without any explanation, new, contemporary sound effects have occasionally been added to the cartoons. I could not believe anybody would tamper with an orignal cartoon like that, but they did it. The new effects are very noticeable and add nothing.

The sound - terrible sync: That's all I can say. The sync is terrible. These cartoons are supposedly remastered. Syncing the sound would be, you would think, the easiest part of any remastering. Nope.

The sound - no alternate audio channels: The Blu-Ray description says there are 3 audio channels. There are not.

The colors: The colors on these cartoons are very bright and rich, but I think some of the original darkness that made the cartoons unique and exciting has been lost. These prints look to me like they have been brightened too much.

The commemorative booklet: Okay, the booklet is nice, although it features lengthy plot descriptions of each of the 17 episodes, hilariously detailed. It would probably take longer to read the synopsis than it would to just watch the cartoon. At least there are no sound issues with the synopsis.

I do not recommend this Blu-Ray.",1352246400,8,1762,4.814569536423841

But here's the big, ""BIG"", problem with this set, the sound sync is off (only milliseconds for the first episode, but the next episode, The Mechanical Monsters, part way in when Lois and Clark are talking, the sound is so far off that it sounds like Lois is talking like Clark, as her lips are moving to Clark's spoken line).

I watched 3 episodes from the first disc (on 2 different Blu-ray players to make sure that it wasn't just a player issue) and the second and third episodes (especially the second) started okay with the episode intro and a tad into the episode, but then the sync just goes WAY off (and not just slightly off, but WAY off, people seeming to say other people's lines in the other people's voices, sound effects happening WAY after the sound was made, etc.) and that was only after 3 of the 17 episodes.

It sucks Kryptonite, because if it wasn't for the sound sync issues, I'd actually prefer it to the Warner DVD's (even with the detail issues and the watermark in the lower right of the screen) because of the Blu-ray's vibrant colours, removal of the consistent print debris that plague every frame of the Warner DVD's and attempted sound enhancement which make the Warner DVD's sound flat by comparison.",1351641600,23,1722,4.676567656765677

Sad to say, apparently every element of this public domain release has been mishandled.  If I were a more cynical person I'd describe this as a intentional deception by the issuer.

From all indications this is a poor transfer, upscaled from secondary sources, not from Warner owned 35mm negatives used in the Superman BD boxed set (from which the cartoons were only issued in SD).

Also, there is apparently a watermark in the corner throughout this release.  That in and of itself would be a deal killer, but there's more.

Evidently detail has been lost in rendering these second rate SD transfers to BD.  There are brighter colors, yes, but less image detail.  You heard that right, LESS image detail.

This reaction is straight from a discussion on the Blu-ray forum for those who want to check out the veracity of my comments.  Initially I was excited about this release, but the more I learned the more apprehensive I became.  Now I'm totally disappointed and disgusted at what has been done to the artistry of these classic Fleischer/Paramount Superman cartoons.

Tragically, the company releasing this travesty is piggy-backing off of all the good reviews of prior releases.  Amazon really needs to fix this by separating reviews of different releases, especially when inferior public domain releases are lumped in with studio archived material and better SD transfers, as the preponderance of positive reviews for earlier DVD releases, which were mastered from better source prints, is likely to confuse the unwary buyer.

I'm only describing what I've learned as a heads-up.  Please take everything you read with a grain of salt, my POV included, as I'm relying on second hand information here, albeit well founded.

Then Bosco put out these cartoons thru Image (Diamond Anniversary)and they were the best prints up to that date. When the standard definition Superman Motion Picture Anthology came out, WB included these cartoons, taken from their original vault prints and they looked fabulous, the Diamond Anniversary couldn't even compare!

When the blu-ray of the Superman Motion Picture Collection came out, these cartoons were included, but only in standard definition. Everyone was hoping for HD, but upscaled to 1080i, they still look great.

So, now this company has taken the exact same dvd from Winstar and are trying to say they are now in BD. For all we know, they're probably upscaled to 1080i!  Buyer beware.",1350000000,10,961,5.214285714285714
1096735,5,6305943389,"Previously, there had been available (and perhaps it is still available) a collection which included just those SUPERMAN cartoons which were made for Paramount by Fleischer Studios, and NOT those which were made under the same contract, but by Famous Studios.

Well, this collection includes BOTH the Fleischer Studios' SUPERMAN cartoons AND the Famous Studios' SUPERMAN cartoons.

ALL are in the ""public domain"", and ALL may be downloaded from the Moving Images site. However, those are from prints (picture and sound) and are of generally poor quality.

The person or persons who uploaded those to the Moving Images site DID NOT have access to the original elements.

THIS collection, with the exception of ""Terror on the Midway"", was made from elements closer to the original ""successive-exposure"" Technicolor negatives, most probably from ""low contrast"" television telecine prints for the picture, and good quality positive prints (NOT necessarily original soundtrack negatives) for the sound. The elements of ""Terror on the Midway"" have not surfaced, so this episode was apparently sourced from a combination of a 35mm telecine print and a 16mm print.

Additionally, in several episodes, where there was significant damage, such as deep scratches, a good duplicate from another episode, or a ""freezed-frame"" from the original, replaced the damaged section where the image was close to, but not necessarily identical to the original, so the result goes something like this: a possibly incorrect intro, a scratched title card (usually freeze-framed from the original), a possibly incorrect but flawless cast and crew credit title cards, a scratched episode title card (usually freeze-framed from the original), and the remainder of the episode being flawless, including the correct, final ""In Technicolor"" logo.

Finally, ALL episodes have been modified to include text which states the original 1941 to 1943 release date, and this text is superimposed over the initial few seconds of the episode itself, AFTER the initial fade-in.

The net result is about as close as one is going to get without the expense of an authorized photochemical or digital restoration.

The final sentence of the liner notes claims, ""These 17 animated masterpieces have been restored to their best possible quality; the images are superbly clear and the original mono soundtrack is nearly flawless"", which is accurate as far as it goes.

HOWEVER, a more truthful claim would be, ""These 17 animated masterpieces have been EDITED FROM THE best possible SOURCE MATERIALS, CONSISTENT WITHIN A LIMITED BUDGET; the images are superbly clear, ALTHOUGH IN SOME CASES ASSEMBLED FROM DIFFERENT EPISODE REELS, and the original mono soundtrack is nearly flawless CONSISTENT WITH ACQUISITION FROM A PRINT AND NOT FROM THE ORIGINAL TRACK NEGATIVE"" (the emphasis is mine, of course).

The earlier release of 9 episodes (Fleischer, ONLY) is correct in all cases, but the quality is quite variable.

This latest release of all 17 episodes (Fleischer, AND Famous) is incorrect in several cases, without compromising the spirit of the episode, and the quality is uniformly as good as is possible without performing an authorized restoration.

A final comment: in the much later 1950s live-action episodes, SUPERMAN's signature motto reflects a post-WW-II American ""world-view"" (as America was the first post-war ""super-power""), and reads, ""... with Truth, Justice and the THE AMERICAN WAY ..."" (the emphasis is mine). In these 1940s animated episodes, SUPERMAN's signature motto reflects a broader, pre-WW-II, pre-""super power"" ""world view"" and reads, simply, ""... with Truth and Justice ...""

Paramount has FINALLY located the original elements of all 17 Fleischer and Famous cartoons and has done a faithful job of restoring these. The Fleischer cartoons, only, are available on Disk 4 of ""Superman The Movie: Four-Disc Special Edition"" (ISBN 1-4198-2395-7), and the Famous cartoons, only, are available on Disk 2 of ""Superman II: Two-Disc Special Edition"" (ISBN 1-4198-2396-5).

Alas, several of these apparently had damaged intros, so incorrect intros from other cartoons from the same family (Fleischer, or Famous) have been substituted (in a few cases, an incorrect intro from the other family was substituted for the damaged intro).

The quality of these is very close to being a true restoration.",1348790400,,4366,5.4188790560471976

A few years ago I purchased a set of these, and until I saw this set listed I didn't know there were seven more episodes I didn't have. I bought this set and it's great!

The stories are good and loaded with action. Superman is voiced by Bud Collier (of ""To Tell the Truth"" fame) who also portrayed the Man of Steel on the radio.

They were shown in movie theaters as ""shorts"" short subjects that preceded the main film.  If you watch these you will see that some of the conceptual themes in this artwork for the Superman cartoons was captured and modernized in the film ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" making a  great homage in a subtle way.  The episodes are interesting as a time capsule view of attitudes of the world for when these were made and are like reference material.  I saw them as a child when they were brought to TV but these were shown rarely.  I recall the phrases much of which originated with the radio show preceding these. I recall the art stylings but not the actual episodes so it was like watching fresh what I was familiar with in otherways.

The Fleischer Superman cartoons are an important part of art, animation and cultural history as well as a window into the social/cultural/technological mix of the 1940s...For example: Examine the robots in 1941's ""Mechanical Monsters"" with their retro homage as shown by the robots in 2004's ""Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow"".
The cartoons also offer a window into the WWII era's war fever and the public's heroic perception of the news media as represented by Lois and Perry White.
This DVD should be a part of any grade and high school teacher's bag of tricks as a media drop in to history and art studies.",1252713600,,706,4.8429752066115705

These were all taken from the original 35mm prints and carefully restored. Each one has gorgeous color, picture, and sound with nothing added or taken away. You will not find a better copy of these masterpieces anywhere. Ironically, this is the best copy of the cartoons, and also one of the cheapest in terms of cost.

Volcano
Terror On the Midway
Japoteurs

1096974,3,6305943389,"I just purchased the 2006 ""Superman: The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection"" I was quite disappointed to see the image quality and the saturation of the cartoons were not that great. The colors were over saturated and the film transfer of the cartoons were not sharp and they lacked detail. Maybe they got rid of dust and scratches somewhat, but overall they don't look that good. Though I did like the extras and the DVD booklet enclosed with it.

I spent quite a bit of time comparing it to the previously released ""The Complete Superman Collection-Diamond Anniversary Edition"" released by Bosko Video in 2000. The Bosko set has much better color representation and much more detail. I reviewed them on a 32"" tube television as well as 50"" wide screen LCD TV. The results were the same.
I was under the impression that VCI Entertainment's ""Ultimate Max Fleischer Collection"" from 2006 was remastered from the original negatives. If so they did not do them justice.

I'm curious to see reviews of the new (2009) ""Max Fleischer's Superman Collection 1941-1942"". That collection baffles me a little as four of them were from 1943. It seems a little strange that the DVD title would not represent that year's cartoons in the collection.

They also seem to have had quite an influence on Paul Dini in creating Batman: The Animated Series in the 1990s. The stories are not of the same level we expect today but are charming in their simplicity. This is a delightful collection that shows us one of the earlier interpretations of our iconic hero. Funny enough, over all these years the Lois Lane we know and love seems to have changed not one bit. She is still sassy and smart and out to scoop Clark.

1097166,5,6305943389,"Let me start this note by saying I hate superman. Well perhaps hate is a strong word, but I dislike Superman a-lot, he is too strong and too unstoppable and even too good for my taste, a man with no wrongs, and in my eyes a man as such does not exist, and so it was in the eyes of the creators of the character in the 40's, making the source material for this cartoons a man, stronger than any man, faster than any man, but still not so perfect and strong that he is not able to get hurt.

 As far as the animation,  being from the 1940's allows it to only be hand painted cells, making it beautiful, and stories that dare to be fantastic, and yet simple, with plans that are grand in elaboration, but with very simple targets, like stealing diamonds but wi th giant robots.

 This cartoon was the base for the Batman Animated Series, which has been the base for every cartoon since it came out. so take a look at the cartoon that provoked the animated revolution of the last 2 decades.

1097385,5,6305943389,"When watching these cartoons, if you focus on the depiction of Superman they can seem somewhat dated, but if you focus on execution and technique they remain amazing cinematic achievements.  Most of the cartoons of decade, whether shorts or full lengths, were borrowing from cutting edge techniques in cinematography.  Many were developing their own aesthetic, such as the masterful Warner Brothers cartoons or the great early feature length films by Disney, but the Fleischers decided to give these early adventures of Superman a distinct noir feel.  By no stretch can these be considered film noir, a term that is slung about as if every other film from the decade qualified.  But the use of shadow in these cartoons is striking and clearly derivative from the developers of film noir cinemagraphic technique like Nicholas Musuraca and others inspired by German Expressionism.  Shot after shot in these cartoons are dominated by shadows and they constantly frame the scenes in interesting ways.  It will remind many animation fans of techniques used by many of the more sophisticated anime animators.

But this clearly isn't our Superman.  In many ways he still is, but in a host of ways this is a Superman who still hasn't quite developed into who we think of as the Man of Steel.  For instance, his uniform is slightly different, the ""S"" placed against a black diamond shape on his chest.  And for the most part this Superman seems unable to fly.  Occasionally he does seem to be able to fly, but more often he seems to be able only to jump, as in his original incarnation.  The rare use of X-ray vision is, to say the least, odd, with his eyes rolling back and glazing over is the most bizarre fashion.  Nor is he as invulnerable or strong as our current superhero.  But in many ways I actually prefer this.  He seems more approachable, more comprehensible.

Apart from Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent, one will find no familiar characters here.  No Jimmy Olsen, no Perry White, no Lex Luthor or any other villains.  No kryptonite!  The depiction of Lois Lane is, however, fascinating.  Though Superman repeatedly has to save her she is no shrinking violet.  She is brave and bold and heroic.  On more than one occasion she is endangered doing what she believes must be done, such as when Japanese spies stealing a top secret airplane and she gets captured by using the radio to warn the military what has happened.  Yeah, she gets captured, but without her the thieves would have stolen the plane.  When she is on a runaway train that villains are attempting to steal she is shot at by bad guys driving alongside the train in a car.  She picks up a machine gun and shoots back.  In many of her incarnations Lois is depicted as more rash than brave, but that is not the case here.

These simply must be seen by anyone who is interested in Superman, the Fleischers in particular or the history of animation in general, or the history of heroic women in popular culture.  Or even if you just love a good story.",1186617600,3,3015,4.702290076335878

1097387,5,6305943389,"Ahead of their time in terms of animation, Superman is still entertaining on this level to the degree that the newer animated series by Warner (as well as its Batman counterpart) are mimicing much of this original style. The comments that can be viewed prior to the cartoons themselves help one appreciate the incredible work (and money - $30,000.00 for one cartoon in an era when one could purchase a very nice home for around $10,000) that went into the making of this series.

The still pages of the comic strip come to life with amazing(and sometimes surrealistic) colors;check out ""The Magnetic Telescope"". Sammy Timberg's musical arrangements hold you riveted into the ever-progressing action of the plot. And then, there is always at the end of the story a comforting quip from Clark Kent to the viewers.  This is Superman as he was meant to be.  This is Superman from the 1940s.  This is Superman who could leap tall buildings in a single bound. Not the Superman of today who travels from galaxy to galaxy.  This is the time zone into which Superman was born.  Relive it!!!

The stories are basic but smart, quick-paced, exciting, and heroic.  Yeah, the soundtracks are a bit over-the top at times, but that was the music style of adventure movies in the 1940s.  I love the spirited characterizations and some of the stories like with the volcano, the runaway train robbery, etc.

I also noticed how the recent Donner and Singer films have borrowed from these.  Especially in ""Superman Returns"", his flying style of dropping out of the sky feet-first was originally done in these animations -- COOL!  A must for Superman fans.",1176163200,3,725,4.9421487603305785

1097791,4,6305943389,"Superman - The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection. Hitting the DVD battlefield to conquer your pocketbook is yet another version of the 17 cartoons produced by Fleischer/Paramount studios from 1941-43. Up to now the only version worth having was the Bosko video release called The Complete Superman Cartoons - Diamond Anniversary Edition  My only complaint about that DVD was the inclusion of the date of each cartoons release super-imposed over the opening of each cartoon. Now about VCI's new release Superman - The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection. Using the word ""Ultimate"" is dangerous. It raises ones expectations to see the best possible release of these wonderful cartoons. VCI slightly misses the mark. The majority of the cartoons are indeed great to look at, but I find it strange that the music at the end of almost every cartoon is the same. That would not be annoying if it were not for the fact that each of the cartoons originally had different and uniquely individual fade out music. The most annoying part of the presentation are the two cartoons TERROR ON THE MIDWAY and THE MUMMY STRIKES. I was awed to see that the opening of TERROR ON THE MIDWAY looked far inferior visually to the version seen on Boskos release. VCIs attempt to cover the defects in the very opening of the cartoon, (Emulsion scratches etc. since no other pre-print has popped up) the VCI editors chose to freeze frame a series of shots that were originally seen in a slow pan. This is not only startling to see but destroys the artistic integrity of the short. MUMMY STRIKES suffers the same quality drop visually. The remainder look excellent. The extras are very enjoyable. The audio interview with Joan Alexander (The voice of Lois Lane on the radio and in the great 1966 Superman Animated series as well) gives some very enjoyable memories of her career. There is a Kirk Alyn Superman Serial trailer from 1948 that looks o.k. And the inclusion of the ""Bonis"" cartoon SNAFUPERMAN is o.k. but it looks like it was lifted from a previous Laserdisc release. All in all for a retail of $9.99 (With a pre-order from Amazon of $6.99, it is worth the price.....but not Ultimate. The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection is available May 30th.",1147737600,44,2250,4.859375

I remember seeing some of these about a decade or so ago on cable tv, and thinking that they would be quite enjoyable to have on video.  Bosko has made that wish come true with this nicely restored version of all 17 classic cartoon shorts.  These are quite interesting to watch even if one is not a big Superman fan, for a couple of reasons. First, they were done in a great film noir style, with lots of cool shadow images and dark story lines.  Second, several of the cartoons clearly reflect the fact that America was at war against hated enemies.  If you're looking for P.C. cartoons for your little kid, you'd better look elsewhere because this is not the Care Bears.

The Bosko DVD Has very clear, crisp video and good sound.  Quite remarkable that they were able to restore these 1940's cartoons so well.  A fine addition to anyone's collection, at a very affordable price.",1138665600,3,935,4.523809523809524

1098008,5,6305943389,"If you are a fan of Superman or comic books in general, get this DVD.  The shorts in this DVD are good old-fashioned serial movies, animated brilliantly by the Fleischer brothers.  Yes, the material is dated, and sometimes unintentionally hilarious.

In one episode, Clark Kent ducks into the broom closet of the Daily Planet, turns on the light so everyone can see him, and changes into Superman.  (We see him taking off his pants.)  Then he apparently walks out of the broom closet, presumably leaving his clothes behind, gets into the elevator in his Superman costume and takes it down to the lobby, where he then flies out the front door on his way to fight crime.  Great stuff.

But it is interesting to see the movie studio's first treatment of Superman.  He is more of a ""man"", or in other words, more mortal.  His super powers are flying, being bulletproof or superstrength.  That's it.  He uses X-ray vision in exactly one of the episodes.  He is more easily knocked unconscious, or magically loses his power to fly after being knocked from a perch.  Lifting a plane or dragging a giant train is a real chore for him, but nonetheless a truly ""superhuman"" accomplishment.

Also, in these cartoons there is no heat vision, no Fortress of Solitude, no Kryptonite.  No Lex Luthor or Bizarro, either.  The villains here are nameless mad scientists who have constructed wires that cause earthquakes in Manhattan, or mechanical monsters who are bank robbers, or evil men who wear hoods and drive around in a ""bullet car"" that destroys civic buildings.

And finally, Lois Lane!  She is a piece of work.  She works to sabotage Clark Kent's journalism career at every turn while hogging all the scoops and glory for herself.  Not only that, she is shooting machine guns while driving an out-of-control train, tailing bad guys by jumping into their motorboat or evil mechanical monster in order to gain access to their secret lairs.  It's terrific.

Finally, the colors and shadow work in these movies is nothing short of masterful.  This is a must for any fan of Superman and particularly of animation.",1121385600,11,2101,4.807262569832402

Although the Man of Steel has conquered, TV,movies and serials as he became the most popular superhero of all time and a pop culture icon, these cartoon's are timeless.

This is rough and tumble, rough cut, and ""unplugged"" Superman.  The plots are simple, the violence is limited, and the moral fiber is all there.  Thank goodness these shorts have been preserved for posterity.

The most refreshing thing about these cartoons is that they are not anime.  The odd angles, weird facial features, and mysterious blue and green hair are missing.  The edges are rounded, the lines curved and the colors subdues. Personally, it is easier on my eye to look at this. And the 1940's backdrops make me laugh--just compare the curved and lumbering Studebakers and De Sotos to the harsh and razor-edges lines of the more recent super-autos, and you see my point.

These classic toons not only retain the early moral fiber, but the charm of the a far more innocent day.  I wonder if, in the intervening half-century we have gotten any better.",1108771200,5,1021,4.861271676300578
1098012,4,6305943389,"Having seen a number of the early Superman cartoons on other ""public domain"" compilations, I can say with confidence, DON'T BUY THE OTHERS!!! Bosko Video has a reputation for putting out high quality products and this collection is nothing less than fantastic. The images are superbly clear and the audio is nearly flawless (no, there are NO new or altered sound effects added).

As much as I love the continuing modern adventures of super heros like Superman, Batman, and Spiderman, the earlier stories and artwork for each hero have always been my favorites. The Fleischer cartoons capture the early art-deco look and feel of the original Superman / Action Comics era. The artwork is great and the stories are timeless. This is the series that spawned the well know lines: ""Faster than a speeding bullet...... More powerful than a locomative....able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.....Superman"" These cartoons are the epitome of early American comic book heros.

The only complaints I have (and really, this is nothing) is that each episode starts with an added supscript ""Originally Released October 1942"" for a few seconds. Having this appear before the cartoon starts at all would have been better instead of inserting over the actual film itself. It would have been better suited to a booklet, which leads to my other complaint. There is no booklet. They do make up for it with a nice video intro regarding Superman and the cartoon series however.

This set is a real steal for the price, and it contains all of the early episodes, complete and fully restored. I would suggest this set for fans who prefer the early look of comic book heros, art deco animation, and Superman in general. Fans of period-look films like The Iron Giant or Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow will also love this (especially when Superman fights robots). Fleisher cartoons have always been great, but all too often the are butchered in the public domain. This is a rare example of Fleisher's work presented in such quality.",1098316800,67,2018,4.894736842105263
1098013,5,6305943389,"""Superman"", the Max and Dave Fleischer animated version, just might be the closest thing there is to seeing the world's greatest superhero at his birth. These cartoons were the very first Superman on screen, made when the comic books were only four years old. You'll be very impressed- I know I was- with the animation art, including faithful character sketches and amazing deco-noir Manhattan settings. This DVD includes all 17 of the Fleischer/Famous episodes, made from 1941-43, complete with the nifty- and catchy- WWII military march-style theme music that, for those of a certain age, will definitely conjure up vintage wartime newsreels. Did you know there was also an alternate intro? I didn't, and it's a great bit of Super-trivia (""Faster than a bolt of lightning!""). You'll also get a kick out of the things Superman fights off: a giant Siberian dinosaur that thaws out of his iceberg (""Arctic Giant""), Egyptian mummies that come to life (""The Mummy Strikes""), and a sabotaged train full of gold bars (""Billion Dollar Limited""). But no matter what obstacles await, Superman always rescues Lois Lane, drags in the villains and returns to his mild-mannered city desk- just like the '50s TV show we all remember. The dialogue is very sparse, but we see the genesis of feisty, witty Lois whenever she speaks.

These cartoons are, wisely, presented uncut and unadorned, with no extras- though the edition I saw included a crude ""Private Snafu"" take. (That was Warner Bros.' wartime cartoon series, in bare-bones black and white.) The second half of the series, with the ""Famous Studios"" credit (the Fleischers sold the business in '42), is a bit formulaic but, thankfully, the animation quality didn't suffer and there are even glints of sassy New York humor, probably courtesy of ""Betty Boop"" alum Izzy Sparber.

So if your Super-memories are a bit hazy, like mine, and want to see how it all began on screen, check out this set and you, too, will not only be humming the theme music, but saying ""Look- up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's..."" ah, you know the rest!",1094860800,4,2083,4.898016997167139
1098014,4,6305943389,"Nostalgia buffs, ""Superfans,""students of quality animation, and lovers of classic comics will enjoy these 17 cartoons produced between 1941 and 1943 by Paramount Studios. In these little gems, the Man of Steel battles an assortment of monsters, mobsters, mad scientists, and malefactors bent on wreaking havoc in Metropolis and sabotaging America's war effort. Despite the rather formulaic plots, what makes this collection worth having is the outstanding attention to detail in the animation and backgrounds, especially in the first nine 'toons produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave. The skyscrapers have a distinctive Art Deco look that gives Superman's world a real personality, a real sense of time and place. Lois Lane shows plenty of spunk long before anyone ever heard the phrase ""women's liberation."" She bluntly calls Clark Kent a fool, packs her portable typewriter (a 1940s laptop) almost anywhere, wields a machine gun to foil train robbers, and flies off solo, Amelia Earhart-style, to interview a mad scientist.
As noted by other reviewers, the quality of the animation and storytelling drop off noticeably in the remaining eight shorts, produced after the Fleischers left Paramount. Overall, however, the series maintains a fairly high standard throughout, probably because associates of the Fleischers also worked on the later entries in the series. Even the lesser quality animation of the later 'toons, to my eyes, looks better than much of the drivel produced for the Saturday morning shows. Modern day viewers may be uncomfortable with the portrayals of Germans and Japanese, but, after all, these cartoons were produced during World War II, when Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were our mortal enemies. I daresay that if someone were to produce a cartoon adventure of Superman vs. Al-Quaeda today, Osama bin Laden and his ilk wouldn't be portrayed very favorably. All things considered, the Last Son of Krypton has seldom looked better than he does in these cartoons.",1088985600,6,2009,5.320754716981132
1098215,5,6305943389,"Growing up in the '80s these Superman cartoons were my absolute favorite. They were readily available on VHS from numerous companies as they were in the public domain, and as such the quality of the prints was often very poor.  I wanted to watch every Superman cartoon, but they were not al available.
This DVD set has EVERY Superman cartoon made in the 1940s.  Today they hold up just as well, beautiful animation, great plot lines, and some are just plain racist, but they still have all the charm and effect from when I was a kid.
Because several, if not all of the cartoons on this DVD are in the public domain, you will find that there are other companies that also release Superman cartoons on DVD, however this is the one DVD to get.  These cartoons have been restored, and are well worth the money.",1087948800,2,806,4.469387755102041
1098216,5,6305943389,"BOY! These cartoons are GREAT STUFF! I read about them as a child when I saw a 1942 ad for the cartoons and it whetted my appetite for them.
For the most part, they tend to tell the same story evey time with few exceptions, but the visual quality is WONDERFUL and even though the tales are somewhat predictable, they are imaginative and fun to watch.
My favorites are ""Terror on the Midway,"" where Supe comes to the rescue when a wild gorilla wreaks havoc at a circus (check out the ""elephant dance"" early on in this film). ""Underground World"" is quite fascinating, as Supe and Lois get lost in an underground kingdom ruled by hawk-men (check out the ending)! ""Showdown"" has Supe face off against a crime-committing Superman pretender.
Some of these cartoons are not for the politically correct crowd. ""Japoteurs"" has Supe stop a Japanese crook from sabotaging a US warplane (remember, this was wartime). ""Jungle Drums"" has Lois burning at the stake while Africans with bones in their noses dance around her. You have to leave your brains at the door and remember the times to enjoy these.
But either case, get some popcorn, bring the kids (and skip the politically incorrect stuff for them), and you'll have a ball from ages 8 to 80.",1084579200,3,1234,4.665137614678899

1098218,5,6305943389,"I can't praise this collection by Bosko Video enough. The picture quality is amazing- before I bought this DVD I actually thought that these cartoons were inherently murky, dark, and fuzzy. It amazed me to find that the original prints were sharp, detailed, and bright. Plus, the DVD menu makes it quick and easy to skip around and find exactly the title that you want. This is a quality production and not some slapped together compilation of public domain material. Plus you get ALL the cartoons from both Fleischer and Famous studios.
I remember back before the mid 60's when there was NO animated super-hero material available. Then a relative told me that she remembered Superman cartoons from WW2. I thought that she must have been kidding me. I simply couldn't believe that if such films existed that they would not be on television. Yet that was the case- no one saw these cartoons for over 30 years. I wish they had been available because they would have been my hands down favorites. Super-hero animation of this high of quality didn't appear again until the '90's. The quality of the artwork is amazing. The colors, shading, and shadows are magnificent. And the overall art deco/ film noir look is pure class.
There is something more about these cartoons. I personally believe that they were some of the best propaganda to come out of the WW2 era (the first two were actually made BEFORE Pearl Harbor.) I mean, a lot of youngsters must have seen these films before going off to war. The Axis was spewing all sorts of propaganda about ""supermen."" They were claiming that superior beings had a natural right to enslave and rule the world. Well, here was a superior being whose only reason to BE was to help those who needed his help. He defended the weak and helpless. He fought for truth and justice. That must have been a powerful example for young men who were about to go off and do the very same thing.....",1073692800,16,1920,4.65
1098219,4,6305943389,"THE COMPLETE SUPERMAN COLLECTION contains all 17 of the Superman cartoons produced from 1941 to 1943 by Paramount Pictures. After years of bad public domain video copies of these same cartoons, the visual quality of the prints seen on this DVD is breathtaking. (All were transferred flawlessly from original 35mm Technicolor prints.) It should be pointed out that the first nine of the Superman cartoons were produced by cartoon pioneer Max Fleischer (creator of Betty Boop) and directed by his brother, Dave Fleischer. The remaining eight cartoons were produced after the Fleischers left Paramount and were made by house directors at the revamped Paramount/Famous Studio cartoon unit. There is no discernible loss in quality. In fact, the remaining eight all break free from the formula established by the Fleischers and offer some of the real surprises on this disc. All the cartoons boast incredibly beautiful and imaginative imagery.
A few notes on some of the individual cartoons:
""Billion Dollar Limited"" (1942)
Almost nonstop movement and action as a robbery gang tries to derail a train carrying a billion dollars in gold to the mint. Lois Lane even picks up a Tommy gun at one point to fire at the attackers.
""The Arctic Giant"" (1942)
Features a giant dinosaur on the rampage in Manhattan (not Metropolis!). Visible landmarks include the Museum of Natural History and Yankee Stadium. Looks forward to both THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and GODZILLA.
""Electric Earthquake"" (1942)
Interestingly, the mad scientist villain is an American Indian who demands the return of Manhattan to his people. When his demand is dismissed, he sets off earthquakes on Manhattan by using giant electrical connectors plugged into the island's bedrock underwater.
""Eleventh Hour"" (1942)
An astounding wartime cartoon as both Clark Kent and Lois Lane are held prisoner in Yokohama by the Japanese. Clark breaks out every night, as Superman, to sabotage Japanese battleships. Lois Lane is even taken before a firing squad at one point.
""Secret Agent"" (1943)
A straight-ahead crime thriller with car chases in the streets of Metropolis and shootouts with police as a beautiful blonde undercover agent tries to get to Washington with a list of spies and saboteurs. The last of the Superman cartoons and one of the best.
If only other American animation producers had taken the lead established by these cartoons and begun doing serious, comic book-based action and science fiction-themed cartoons. As it stands, it took about 30 years for Japan's animators to take up the cause and give us exemplary action and sci-fi animation on a par with the Superman cartoons.",1071792000,3,2648,5.174825174825175
1098220,5,6305943389,"I considered myself a lukewarm Superman fan.. I'd read some of the comics, and I really liked the first movie.  I picked up this DVD mostly because it was very inexpensive, and seemed like something worth having in the back of a DVD collection somewhere.  Man, I did not do this DVD justice at all.  It deserves a central place in any collection.  The cartoons are truly amazing.  They're all clever, well-voiced and crafted, and developed in a very cool art deco style that seems these days restricted to faux Italian cafe posters in your downtown Starbucks.  The most pleasant aspect of all was how surprisingly modern the cartoons feel.  Created mostly in the early 1940s, they do have a certain jingoism to them, particularly the post-Pearl Harbor ones, but otherwise I was amazed to see how robust Lois Lane's characterization was.  Not only is she cast as an independent career woman, her grit and style actually outpace that of the later movies.  Perhaps that's just my own 1940s-1950s bias speaking, but nonetheless it's interesting to see how her repeated 'damsel in distress' status necessary to bring out Superman is really much more nuanced and flattering.
The DVD itself also shows the films with little fanfare aside from an opening scrawl and a subtitle at the start of each indicating its original release date.  The cartoons are so good and of such high production values that one can almost believe it when the distributor gushes about their pleasure at providing them to the public.  You won't find a better bargain than this collection.",1062633600,4,1556,4.8783269961977185

In this wonderful collection, Superman battles killer robots, a berserk go-rilla, a maniacal mad scientist, and a group of criminals in a bullet-car (plus much more)! Also, I prefer the Lois Lane in these shorts to the Lois in the comics, TV series', or the movies! Now, they're all here on DVD! I love every episode!

To call these 'cartoons' seems to trivialize how good these shorts really are.

Also, there is no noodling with the sound to make it ""booming"". It's mono and perfect. The picture quality is the best of those I've seen so far (I've seen the laser discs, the Nature vs War...versions and the 3 pack with Popeye).
Only ONE downside. After each chapter starts, a small title on the bottom of the screen comes on telling us when it was originally released in theatres. It's short but unexpected and, no matter what anyone says, an alteration. This...keeps it from being perfect, but they are...good.

1098429,5,6305943389,"My children request this DVD regularly. Animation aficionados will be in nirvana watching this feast for the eyes. Most adults, though, might have to take the episodes in small doses. The plots are too similar and the Superman theme song plays almost continually. The opening title sequence is also pretty long, which becomes tiring moving from one short to another. Parents should be reasonably happy with the content here. There's less overt violence here than in most Disney films. Lois is a very independent modern woman; even though Superman continually rescues her from her journalistic risks, she remains a tough character - much more so than Clark. In fact, she exudes more personality than even Superman - who speaks very little and is usually busy performing heroic deeds.
My DVD has no special features - just the 17 Superman shorts. It also does not have enhanced audio features. Thus, I'm a bit confused by the comments by other reviewers. Potential buyers of this DVD will want to compare this to the two rival Superman restoration DVDs by Audio Galaxy. I do not own those, but I have some clips of them on my Gulliver's Travels DVD by Audio Galaxy. The color in this Bosko Video edition is indeed darker, but Audio Galaxy's renditions still look great. Who knows how either of these compare to the original 1940s film before time took its toll on them. I liked very much what Audio Galaxy did with the sound to Gulliver's Travels, and I expect the enhanced audio option on their Superman DVDs are a plus. For me the big advantage of the Bosko Video was that it's all on one disk - rather than Audio Galaxy's two disks.",1033862400,3,1633,4.713286713286713

1098432,4,6305943389,"Produced during 1941-42, the classic Superman cartoons of Max and Dave Fleischer remain among the finest works in animation history. Unfortunately, their public-domain status has resulted in several DVD compilations of variable quality. Bosko's ""Diamond Anniversary Edition"" is the best Superman disc available. All 17 cartoons are uncut and presented in the order of their original theatrical release. However, it should be noted that the Fleischers were responsible for the first 10 Superman cartoons (including ""Japoteurs""), with the remaining shorts produced by Famous Studios during 1942-43. Despite a few memorable efforts, such as ""Jungle Drums"" and ""The Underground World,"" the Famous animators were unable to duplicate the Fleischer magic. Since the cartoons were expensive to produce, it was no surprise that Paramount and DC Comics agreed to end the series after two years. Still, the best Superman shorts  ""The Mechanical Monsters"" (1941) and ""The Bulleteers"" (1942)  are mini-masterpieces that evoke the comic-book spirit better than any live-action film.

Visually, they were great, it is a little odd seeing this old animation buffed and shined to try and match Blu-ray quality and it doesn't really work, but it is crisp and clear and all the details are there to be gazed upon in wonder.  You can see all the money that was put into this animation back in the day as clearly as they would have been able to in the theaters when these cartoons first appeared.
Here is why I'm upset:  the audio.  There were nearly half the cartoons some on each disc including on one of my personal favorites where the audio was off by 5-6 seconds in some cartoons the audio kicked in too early, others too late and it ruins the experience completely.  Without the sound and picture in sync the whole cartoon is absolutely ruined.  For such high quality cartoons to be ruined by such a horrible mistake as a sound mix up is a crying shame.  Am I returning the product?  I'm seriously thinking about it, but the visuals are so good and the cartoons that do sync are a perfect in practically every way.
Do they have some things in them that can be seen as horribly racist and/or sexist by today's standards?  Absolutely! But these are a product of their time, just like all the other cartoons of that time that have elements that in today's world we look at uncomfortably because we know that what is being presented is wrong.
