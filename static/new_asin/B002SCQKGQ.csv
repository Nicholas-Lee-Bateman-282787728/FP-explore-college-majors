3980734,5,B002SCQKGQ,"It is maybe of interest that this series was created in response to Simon Schama in ""A History of Britain"" which in fact was a ""history of England"" with any mention of Scotland, Wales or Ireland tagged on if it they had any connection to England. There were so many complaints to the BBC about this, that this series grew out of a response.

Too long has Britian = England (no such thing as English Government, English Monarch (is there a Scottish one now??), English navy/army/airforce etc), now with our reclaiming ourselves as a nation and a people - maybe this crude stereotype is beginning to be broken - and this series does a great service to that. In some ways it is quite funny in that it turns the tables - that England gets a mention when it is in reference to what is happening in Scotland!!!",1292889600,,804,4.4324324324324325
3980735,5,B002SCQKGQ,"Each of these ten episodes is one hour long and so you are treated to a crash course in Scottish history in just 600 minutes. It is bloody, turbulent and filled with pathos and Neil Oliver is engaging and delightfully Scottish just as Simon Schama in ""A History of Britain"" is particularly English, and both are very fine story tellers and historians - at least at the popular level. I enjoyed every minute of this series and was sorry it was over.

  The first episode alone, ""The Last of the Free,"" might be worth the price of this DVD. The viewer is treated to breathtaking vistas of Scotland with all its lochs, mountains, castles and fastnesses as Neil Oliver recounts the murky history of Scotland as it first emerges from the pages of history via Tacitus and his account of the Roman general Agricola's foray into Caledonia in 88 AD. Not much else is known of the northern barbarians for centuries, but they reemerge as the Picts as the Romans leave Britain for good. As Angles and Saxons replace Romans in the south we see Picts in the northeast of Scotland, Gaels in the west, and Britons in the south around the year 500 AD. Despite the Viking invasions of the British isles Kenneth MacAlpin arises as king of the Picts, but it is his grandson, Constantine II, who becomes the first king of Scotland. During his 43 year reign Constantine introduces Gaelic ways to the Picts and Scotland is now known as Alba in Gaelic and Scotland in English even though the isle of Britain would remain an island of separate kingdoms and divided nations under no single monarch for centuries to come.

  Episode II ""Hammers of the Scots"" fast forwards almost three hundred years to the brutal Alexander II who crushes all opposition and succeeds in uniting all of Scotland. His son, Alexander III, the last of the Canmores, ushers in a golden age where Norman culture in southern Scotland with its cathedrals and abbeys and Gaelic culture to the north thrive side by side. The unexpected death of Alexander in 1286 leaves Scotland without an heir making Scotland vulnerable to invasion and civil war. Within ten years time Scotland is broken and dominated by Edward I of England, but his draconian methods enable William Wallace to capture the popular imagination and cause a peasant uprising and win a stunning victory at Stirling Bridge in 1297. Wallace's gains are short lived, but his heroism along with Edward I's cruelty created something earlier kings of Scotland never could: a Scottish identity.

  Episode III ""Bishop makes King"" details the long and gory rise of Robert the Bruce. Oliver emphasizes the role of the Scottish bishops in shaping the national destiny of Scotland as they appealed directly to the pope for the legitimacy of a Scottish king independent of England. After Bannockburn the Bruce became legend and along with the bishops brought about a revolution in Scottish identity by ensuring that Scotland remain its own sovereign nation.

  Episode IV ""Language is Power"" depicts the struggle between the Stuarts and the MacDonalds. By the early 1400s Scots was spoken in the Lowlands while Gaelic was spoken in the Highlands and the isles. As the two families vied for power it was the Gaelic language and culture that was hit the hardest. The triumph of the House of Stewart ensured that Scots would become the preferred language of the court and Lowland culture. The Gaelic tongue became synonymous with treacherous and backwards Highlanders.

  Episode V ""Project Britain"" begins with Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, trapped on an island in the middle of a loch under pressure by Scots noblemen to relinquish the crown. Scotland had already undergone the Protestant Reformation and Mary's blunderings ensured her soom, yet Mary produced one thing the Tudors had not - an heir to the throne and so Mary's son, James VI of Scotland eventually became James I of England. Fortunes were reversed as a king of Scotland now sat on the English throne, but James's dreams of a united kingdom, a Great Britain, would not be brought about by a mere act of Parliament.

  Episode VI ""God's Chosen People"" portrays the Scottish Covenanters and their famous contract with God
as national hysteria. The Presbyterianism of the Scots would not tolerate the imposition of a ""popish"" prayer book and so Charles Stuart and his English archbishop sparked the Bishops War and then Scotland was dragged into the English Civil wars as well. The beheading of Charles I in 1649 shocked most Scots and left the famous Covenanters without a king. It was not until the Restoration that the national hysteria of the Covenanters began to subside. Most Scots and the now more moderate Kirk seemed happy to have a Stuart back on the throne. James II's unabashed Catholicism ensured his downfall in 1688, but while many were relieved in Scotland to have a Protestant king once more others pined for their beloved Scottish Stuart kings and so the Jacobites were born promising further misery for Scotland.

  Episode VII ""Let's Pretend"" takes us to the court of Louis XIV where James II was given a luxurious mansion from which he could still pretend he was king of Scotland. Meanwhile Scotland bankrupts itself via the Darien misadventure in Panama making union with England an economic necessity. The Jacobite uprising of 1715 is a disaster and the second uprising of 1745 ends tragically at Culloden. Every nook and cranny of the Highlands are now mapped by the victor of Culloden, the duke of Cumberland, and Fort George is built in the Highlands to pacify the unruly Highlanders once and for all.

  Episode VIII ""The Price of Progress"" takes us to Jamaica where exiled Jacobites make a fortune off of the backs of slaves while Scotland exports new ideas to America. Scotland is now a mercantile nation, but where the wealth of the few is not shared evenly. The war of independence in the American colonies was supported by Presbyterian ministers and Scottish Enlightenment ideas that justified the American revolution. It seems that America, not Scotland, was the beneficiary of the Scottish Enlightenmet; as if America, and not Scotland, were the promised land. Scotland remains held back.

  Episode IX ""This Land is our Land"" begins with Scotland's most painful memory: the Highland clearances that began in 1792. The Highlands are emptied of their people and replaced with sheep by Scottish lords who now live in London. In the early part of the 1800s Sir Walter Scott reshaped Scotland forever by romanticizing the Highlands in his novels. Scott even managed to make his mythical Scotland a reality as George IV visited Edinburgh in 1822. When the potatoe famine of Ireland reached the shores of Scotland in 1846 the people of Scotland rose up to rescue the noble Highlanders they had read so much about in Scott's novels, but in Ireland a million starved. The clearances continued and evictions forced Scots to emigrate to Canada and Australia. Not until 1886 did the clearances end for good.

  Episode X ""Project Scotland"" shows Scotland rupturing in the 1920s as tens of thousands emigrate to the new world. At the beginning of the 20th century Scotland had had one of the most powerful economies thanks to steel, but by the 1931 over 400,000 Scots had left their homeland in the 20th century alone. There was talk again of Home Rule and gifted poets, both nationalist and socialist, ushered in a Scottish Renaissance. The war interrupted the future and by the 1950s socialism was the order of the day, but by the 1960s unemployment remained a perennial problem. Devolution, a form of home rule, was discussed in earnest after the discovery of oil in the 1970s, but it was not until 1999 that the Scots finally established their own parliament. The early 21st century has not been so bleak economically for Scotland's five million inhabitants, but the question of how much more self determination is in store for the Scots has yet to be seen. ...",1289952000,151,7946,4.873145400593472
3980736,4,B002SCQKGQ,"I loved Simon Schama's ""A History of Britain."" When I heard about ""A History of Scotland,"" hosted by Neil Oliver, I was intrigued. Never having heard of Oliver before, I wasn't sure what to expect. Surprisingly, the two hosts are quite similar in how they present their histories, and in a way, they succinctly represent their respective nations: Schama's delivery is unctuously English, Oliver's is passionately Scottish.

The first sensation you feel as you begin to watch ""A History of Scotland"" is one of time travel. The gorgeous scenic footage of Scotland could have been shot in 1009 as easily as 2009. And as Oliver narrates, it seems as if the ancient land itself is telling you its story.

Historical recreations also illustrate Scotland's history, and their production value is quite good. But you can only do so much in that manner, so Oliver's on-camera appearances help to glue everything together. His storytelling style is enjoyable, although occasionally, his walking-away, talking-over-the-shoulder standups remind me a bit of Eric Idle leading us to the house where he was born in ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.""

Not being terribly knowledgeable about Scotland's history, I can only take Oliver at his word as far as historical accuracy goes. There's no way to share every story from Scotland's long history, but over four DVDs, what stories Oliver does tell are detailed and rich. Not a dry recitation of names and dates, but a portrayal of emotions from flesh-and-blood historic figures. Oliver also does a fine job of coalescing the sometimes confusing relationship between Scottish kings, the British monarchy and religion into an understandable narrative. Perfect for those of us who sometimes can't get our Jameses and Jacobites straight.

Disc Five contains a two-part series called ""How The Celts Saved Britain,"" hosted by Dan Snow. It's not as entertaining as ""A History of Scotland,"" and Snow, though competent enough, isn't quite as engaging as Oliver. But it is still a collection of historical information guaranteed to put a few new wrinkles on your brain.",1289779200,65,2096,5.155882352941177
3980737,5,B002SCQKGQ,Wonderfully informative DVD and great narration by Mr Oliver. It's a pity that there is NO blu-ray offered in this region as yet :( This DVD just screams for one with it's superb camera work :),1285977600,3,193,4.388888888888889

3980739,5,B002SCQKGQ,"This is a riveting account of a turbulent history of yet another small country fighting for its integrity, let alone its independence, from its much bigger southern neighbour. The early portion of the formation of one country revealed much new information. Wallace at Stirling Bridge, The Bruce at Bannockburn and the Declaration of Arbroath remain the defining incidents in the forging of the nation. The disaster of Flodden was never covered; maybe just as well! A frank account of the Young Pretender's (Bonnie Prince Charlie's) attempt to re-impose a Catholic Crown on Protestant Great Britain helps correct the Scottish versus English fabrication. A bigger fabrication was Walter Scott's role in the 'tartanisation' of Scotland; brilliant marketing but a deflection of the essential character of the country. This might have been conveyed with the story of Red Clydeside and the birth of the Labour Party; they weren't touched. Despite the two omissions, the series really is excellent and contrary to the image of rain, some of the landscapes had light that was crystal clear; just like the story-telling!",1284249600,48,1111,5.2824858757062145
3980740,4,B002SCQKGQ,"So far I really enjoy the DVD's good detail. I am a bit disappointed about one thing. I was surprised the author skipped from the late 800's and jumped to the 1200's. A lot of the foundation for Scotland's history occurred between 900 and 1200. What about Macbeth? How about the Cannmore's? King David and his building of the Abbeys, Saint Margaret Queen of Scotland and lots of other stuff during that time. I kept checking the DVD to see if I had missed something. Maybe this period is covered in the later DVD's? I am still on the first one.",1284163200,6,544,4.396039603960396

3980751,5,B002SCQKGQ,"Prequel warning: This is a Region B only disc.

As a hybrid Scot, mixed Scottish and English heritage, living in the Highlands it seemed essential to get to grips with an overview of the history of Scotland. As one who has enjoyed Neil Oliver's personal takes on the TV 'Coast' series it seemed likely that he would be an entertaining and informative guide to his own country.

This expectation has proved to be true for both myself and my, English, wife who found the whole series to be equally compelling. Neil Oliver is never short on enthusiasm and often spikes his dialogue with humorous side lines such as Ann, a sizeable Queen of England, requiring a square coffin! This mixture of accurate historical detail enlivened by possibly irreverent comment will be engrossing for those who warm to his 'Coast' contributions but may be irritating to those who don't! One can never be in doubt about his passion concerning the subject and in this respect he shares his knowledgeable and committed style with the likes of David Attenborough. There is never a suggestion of reading a script - this comes straight from the heart with added intensity!

The video content is well up to BBC standards and features plenty of stunning Scottish scenery. There is some repetition of slow motion images such as falling goblets and spilt blood on floors but, as this is probably preferable to seeing blood shed in reality, it should not prove to be much of an obstacle to enjoyment. The same can be said of the musical soundtrack which has far more appropriate character than much to be found swamping the sounds of nature on wildlife documentaries for example.

The two sixty minute documentaries provided as bonus material and covering the advent of Christianity in Ireland and then Scotland is of adequate interest but unlikely to be re-visited for repeat viewing. The total content could have been usefully reduced to one episode without loss as there is a shortage of new visual material for 120 minutes. The accompanying educational content tends to be somewhat repetitive, revisiting ideas from different but similar viewpoints to reinforce simple ideas. Not too much need be made of this though as, for most purchasers, the focus will be on the excellent ten-part 'History of Scotland.'

This is a compelling survey of key moments in Scotland's history presented in Neil Oliver's typically informative, engaging and intensely personal style.",1478476800,,2435,4.987684729064039

Although I've had this set for a couple of years, I watched it again in eager anticipation of a recent trip- my first- to Scotland.

It covered a lot of history in a relatively short amount of time, not a dull moment in the series; fast moving.  The history of Scotland is a sad story.  Yes, it had some high points, but for the most part it is a sad story.  The end of the story made me want to cry (and men aren't supposed to cry!).
I'm not an historian or an archaeologist, but have some feel for how history is to be told, and I think this was well told - balanced, not much revisionism if any, and accurately portrays the underlying motivations of the different historical movements.  However, I have one objection: there was no mention of the Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF) completed in 1647.  I believe this document played a significant part in the conflict between England and Scotland.  As I understand it, the WCF was commissioned by the English parliament.  English Puritans were appointed to an assembly to produce the WCF.  Scottish Presbyterians were invited to join the assembly to obtain their input.  The goal was to produce a document that would contain a system of doctrine based solely on the teaching of the Bible that would unite the factions within Great Britain.  It resulted in the greatest document that the church has ever produced.",1383004800,,1385,4.725

3980841,5,B002SCQKGQ,"A compelling and informative 10 part series taking us through the history of Scotland from prehistoric man until today. Neil Oliver presents this with a passion for his county and for his history, a penetrating understanding and panache for the dramatic and with a brutal honesty.

Certainly Oliver is a master presenter-he keeps the viewer gripped, and certainly this is well researched. Through the history of Scotland and and how it has been shaped by its adversarial and sometimes subordinate role to England, we explore the people and landscapes of Scotland , with excellent cinematography of landscapes, churches and castles, cities, towns and villages and recreated scenes from history.
We learn something of the exploits of Columba, Kenneth McAlpine, William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Mary Queen of Scots, Walter Scott Adam Smith, John McCormick, and Jock McConall.
Oliver takes us through the formation of the Scottish nation from Scots, Picts and Vikings,  both the brutality of the civil wars fought between Scottish nobles and kings, and the centuries long struggle with the English, to Scotland's pivotal role in the origins and particulars of the English civil wars, the deprivations and death suffered by the Scottish people during the Highland potato famine, the great exploitations and suffering visited upon Scottish workers and their families, the Scottish struggles over independence self-determination and devolution and between ideological systems in the 20th century, and ends with an eye to the future.
 Interesting and appalling to read how the British government did not aid the people suffering and dying form the Highland famine due to not wanting to 'interfere with free markets', that more Scottish children died of hunger between the two world wars as Scottish soldiers had been killed in the first world war, and the anger of the Scottish people at the deprivations, unemployment and brutal cuts in welfare by Margaret Thatcher in the 80s, given that very few Scots voted for her , and the Scottish people felt they were being subjected to punishment by a government not of their choosing.
Certainly the Scots, Irish Welsh and English proletariat have all suffered deprivations of the Industrial Revolution that match those of black slaves and the peoples of the third world, therefore none of the working classes in the British islands should have to suffer from affirmative action or any form of 'positive discrimination' against the indigenous inhabitants of the isles.",1362355200,2,2505,5.288944723618091

3980849,5,B002SCQKGQ,"Some years ago as my flight for the states took off from London's Gatwick airport, the pilot did a 180 turn and headed upland.  As luck would have it, it was a gorgeous day and the plane maintained a lower altitude rather than immediately climbing to 35,000 feet.  As a result, I was treated to a panoramic view below of the rolling hills and small towns of England with its patchwork fields.  Not too much later, the terrain changed radically and became thickly clustered with hills and mountains, seemingly devoid of cities.  Quite frankly, I didn't know what I was looking at, and only after I'd gotten home and pulled out an atlas did I realize I'd had an amazing flyover of Scotland.  At that moment I vowed to return to Great Britain and check Scotland out for myself.  Five years later I did so, and found it to be the most beautiful spot on earth.  The scenery in Scotland is SO extraordinarily lovely that twice I was reduced to tears at its magnificence.

What I love about A HISTORY OF SCOTLAND is its unrestrained use of spectacular photography coupled with a thorough and pithy explanation of Scottish history, which is turbulent at best and not the easiest thing to get your mind around.  The appealing narrator, Neil Oliver, never allows your attention to wander.  His narrative style carries with it charm and a sense of energy that makes the material anything but dry.

It was so good to re-experience Scotland through this DVD, and whether you're planning a trip there (lucky you!), or probably won't make it in this lifetime, the next best thing is this DVD.  If I could give it six stars, I would.",1355875200,15,1617,4.59581881533101

3980853,1,B002SCQKGQ,"After loving Neil Oliver's 'A History of Celtic Britain', I was absolutely shocked and dismayed by this series after only the first two episodes.

The visuals are mostly helicopter shots of landscapes and clouds, repeated shots of dripping blood, and actors in costume who stare menacingly into the camera.

It's take on Scottish history is no better, and can be described as superficial and weirdly selective at best. It skips most well known events entirely, focusing instead on de-bunking Scotland's 'myths' of nationhood--for example they focus on William Wallace being a cruel man by repeatedly mentioning how he made a belt out of a dead enemy's skin--(no mention is made of the phenomenal cruelty of Edward I)--and this 'anecdote' is taken out of context of the general practices of the time . Whether the belt story is true or not is of no importance because it is not relevant in the story of Scotland's History compared to the impact his fight for freedom from the English had, and if you want to mention cruelty: his horribly cruel death in England. It seems the series just wants to dismiss or reduce his symbolic value to the Scots. Why? I wonder...

When this series originally came out there was huge controversy and condemnation from Scottish academics about it being Anglo-centric. And I have to agree, not only does is it seem designed to tell the Scots : 'You were never a nation, and when you were pretending to be you were barbaric!' but the series also has a skewed and unsatisfactory way or relating what few selective facts it does give. And it's only visual attraction is due to the beauty of the repeated shots of Scottish landscape...

My family and I couldn't watch beyond the second episode and have thrown it out. This series can only please non-Scots, and the English part of the Westminster Government. I am shocked at the BBC!!!",1348358400,82,1861,4.788161993769471

I began getting into more material about Ireland and Scotland, etc., after recently finding that I have some Celtic heritage, but mainly from Ireland and the Isle of Man rather than Scotland. Unlike many other documentaries, the History of Scotland (whether intended or unintentional) uniquely revealed the human tragedy that generations of ordinary people had to endure under the feudal societies that dominated much of Europe over many centuries.

What was particularly interesting (and shocking) was where, in Episode 7 (this is the SPOILER ALERT part), it was indicated that only those who had land holdings of a certain size could vote in 17th century Scotland, which ultimately led to the loss of Scotland's independence (via union with England) through the short-sighted votes of less than 4,000 people! Some of these same few voting people previously lost money (25 percent of the net worth of all in Scotland) by making bad investments in the Darien scheme in Central America, and were allegedly paid for their votes by others who wanted union.  It shows that bad things can happen when only a few control all the land and/or wealth of a country.

I also liked the extra DVD in the set called ""How the Celts Saved Britain"". The series had a little repetition in the footage, but when you consider that the episodes would be seen a week apart by most, I doubt that this would be noticed.  Besides, the footage of scenery that is repeated is spectacular!",1333843200,,1523,4.9375
3980855,5,B002SCQKGQ,The cinematography was beautiful. I learned alot and enjoyed watching all 6 dvd over the period of a week. Those whop felt the accent of the announcer made it diffult to understand I could not disgree more. I do wish there would have been more information on the highland clans and some of their hero's. I liked the fact that there was information about how teh politics of the day related with what was going on in other areas of Europe to give it historical context. This DVD will be watched over and over again. It makes me want to go and see Scotland in person.,1332979200,,565,4.339622641509434
3980856,5,B002SCQKGQ,"This is an outstanding historically accurate and entertaining DVD set.  Although I'm American  I had no problem at all with  the narrator's Scottish brogue.  In fact, it's quite charming and adds to the authenticity of the program.  However, I agree with other reviewers on one point.  The truly awful loud music drowns him out almost completely.  After suffering through the first disc, the only solution was  turning the volume down low enough to  almost eliminate the music.  This allowed me to faintly hear the narration but it was necessary to use the subtitles.  It was still worth the effort because I thoroughly enjoyed all the chapters and was sorry to see it end.",1329696000,,673,4.867256637168142
3980857,5,B002SCQKGQ,"This is the story of scotland, or pictland as it was called until 900 a.d.
I used to think the picts just vanished until I saw this series. In fact they just
merged with the rest of physical scotland and that's that. The show is well narrated and has fantastic senery throughout. The show is one mans view of things and the perhaps the purest in a historical sense. The show however is just excellent and covers 2,000 years of history. He doesn't cover prehistorical times very much but it is the story of scotland the nation , more than the physical landmass. This show has alot of animated maps and other great ideas to help you get a idea of what is happening as he narrates. And the narrator is easy to understand in this one. I reject the review that you can't understand him. He is very clear in this show and the show follows an easy narrative.  Each episode starts in a time period and ends in a time period. It's a overview , but with ten episodes , you get alot of information. And no other filmed history of  Scotland is as clear as detailed as this one is. It's ten hours long after all. It was a whole one season tv series and it's worth you time. You will learn alot about Scotlands history. On later episodes you get more political perhaps as one reviewer stated , but it's his view and you can decide wether you agree or not. One thing is for sure this is a great show and without a doubt Scotland is far better off as part of the Uk then it would be as a seperate nation. The same goes for Wales, and the ilse of man. This was filmed in hd , although this is only a standard dvd , it's stunning. So sit back and learn alot in a entertaining way. You will meet some of the great characters in Scotish History in this series too. Robert the bruce, William Wallace, Alexander 3, Constatine and duncan,  and many others like the stuarts.
The show is more than a history of kings though , it is the history of a nation. And it includes Dan Snows 'how the celts saved Britain"".  This two part series tells how the irish church and christianity saved the Britain from the savagery  that ruled the land after the fall of the Roman empire. And there is no doubt that people were far better off under the new order rather than the old war gods.  So that's a big bonus here.",1325203200,,2280,4.205949656750572

After returning from a Scottish games, I decided to look for a way to improve my knowledge but didn't want to read a boring history.  I'm thrilled I was able to find this DVD series.  Beautifully photographed and engaging, it is anything but boring.  Neil Oliver does an excellent job as narrator, brogue and all.  It has helped me place disparate names and events in historical and chronological context.

3980862,3,B002SCQKGQ,"I bought this set mostly because of the reviews. It does have a few problems. One is the narrator. It's so hard to understand what he is saying. I have the TV turned up to loud just to hear him & have to replay & replay because of the way he talks. The other problem is the music. I don't know why, but the British have always had a problem with which is more important, music or listening to the person talking. When the music overplays the talking, it's a waste of time trying to figure out what the person is saying. Music should be LOW so you can hear the person speaking. It seems all of British shows have this problem. Scenery is terrific. We're half way thru the series & I feel as though we should start over because we can't understand what he is saying. Also, the series is very repetative, could have nade it shorter in story & longer in scenic views.",1319673600,14,863,4.204819277108434

3980864,2,B002SCQKGQ,"Neil Oliver first came to my notice through the excellent BBC programme 'COAST'. His engaging and easy going manner added hugely to the programmes worth, in my opinion and, after he had been THE narator and become a segment narator, his easy manner and love of his subject became even more pronounced.

Consequently, I was very keen to view his 'Hisoty of Scotland'. The History started off quite well, with the early hisotry found ost interesting - and largely completely untold previously. Sadly the promise was not fulfilled!

The closer one got to the 'modern times', the more the Hisotry became 'political' and hugely a record of personal opinion. It wasn't that all the views were clearly incorrect or fallacious, but many were most certainly arguable, For axample, the reasons for the death of the Shipbuilding industry, the Coal mineing industry, the huge alteration in the Steel industry and the nationalised Rail Service were all reported in a very one-sided manner.

In some nstances throughout the programme, fairness was clearly exercised, but sadly not uniformly. This detracted greatly from the programmme's worth and value.

As others have alluded, many great characters in Scotalnd's hisotry were missing from the owrk - or greatly minimised in the telling. Others, were glorified beyond worth.

No! One has to state that parts of the history were interesting, but the worth of the views suffered because of the bias show in other aspects.",1312761600,5,1456,5.100840336134453
3980865,5,B002SCQKGQ,"In 2009 I spent my Holiday in Scotland.  When freinds asked me what I enjoyed the most the answer was easy, the people.  A History of Scotland was a beautiful tribute to a people forged in the furnace of conflict brought on unfortunately by her own aristocracy old and new.  Scotland is a land of dramatic landscapes and people which this film details beautifully.  It is depressing and glorious all at the same time, sometimes painful destroying old myths and revealing the truth and it kept me turning the page throughout the program.  It is probably the most faithful documentary on a nation and people that I have ever seen.  Don't expect Mel Gibson to come riding to the rescue, but please enjoy the musical score, narration, and the Scottish spirit...",1308268800,2,757,4.740458015267175

Neil Oliver is witty and engaging and backed up by a great script, beautiful cinematography and well suited background music. I only wish it covered more ground as I enjoyed it so much. If you enjoyed Simon Schama's a History of Britain you will love this. The companion book to this series is also well worth a look for History enthusiasts. Oliver's engaging style on screen is evident in his writing and his books are quite wonderfully refreshing and a pleasure to read. Lets all hope to see in the near future Neil Oliver's a History of Ancient Britain come available to U.S. anglophiles and British Historians alike.",1306368000,10,718,4.6171875

3980869,5,B002SCQKGQ,"I just spent 3 weeks walking the nearly empty northwest highlands in Scotland, and fell in love with the place (I live in Montana, and it's amazing too, so that's saying something!).  I read a little about Scotland's history and natural history before I took my trip, but found during my travels I wanted to know much, much more.  While I thought I knew a little about English history (I'm a huge history buff), I've found I'm practically illiterate as far as Scottish history, and it was rather a shock to find the little I thought I knew has been shaped more than I realized by my childhood readings of books such as ""The Scottish Chiefs"" and those by the charlatan Sir Walter Scott and 'Ring of Bright Water' (which I admit I still love).

The series is ten parts long, and while there is more I'd still like to know, I feel I've been given a little education that will make any further travels in Scotland that much more enjoyable.

Neil Oliver is a personable, but straightforward host and an interesting speaker.  He has an obvious love and pride for his home turf, and clearly enjoyed the opportunity to present this information.  I had no trouble understanding his Scots accent, but some Americans who aren't devotees of Brit TV as I am might have a little difficulty at times.  The dramatized portions were believable, and  added to the historical narrative.  The fact that this series is also loaded with gorgeous footage of Scottish landscapes makes it worth the price of the series alone.

Another excellent BBC offering!",1305590400,4,1533,4.686567164179104
3980870,4,B002SCQKGQ,"This series, although rather lengthy, is well worth the time. It also included the series ""How the Celts Saved Britain"", which was interesting but ended far too abruptly with the Viking invasions into areas which are now Scotland. It should have better dove-tailed nicely into the series on Scotland, or at perhaps been a longer series on its own.

With that said, the scenery in A History of Scotland is spectacular, the episode featuring The Gaelic gave me chills, and the summation of Scotland's past (especially the ruling families, etc.) easily digested though I wish more time had been devoted to exploring how the Norman invasion of Anglo-Saxon ""England"" effected Scotland. Some of the content seemed to be chosen, or presented, to fit a prejudice; based on the narration, Mr. Oliver seems to have a disdain for Christianity (or at least the Covenanters, who were portrayed as Scotland's equivalent to the Taliban), believes the United States of America is a democracy (it is a republic), and that the Colonists met the ""Redcoats"" on the green because of taxes (they met the ""Redcoats"" to prevent them from seizing the Colonists gunpowder and related supplies). On the other hand, I acknowledge that history is always presented according to prejudice. After all, depending on where in the USofA you live, the ""United States Civil War"" might also be called ""The War of Northern Aggression"".

Overall I highly recommend the series. Watching it and other programs, and reading history books, should certainly help those who are interested develop a much better understanding of THE history of Scotland.",1304899200,,1606,5.102661596958175

3980873,5,B002SCQKGQ,"So much better than Schama! The story of Cined mac Ailpn, or Kenneth MacAlphin, is well told. The narrative avoids pontificating bombast and presents a fresh historical perspective. Neil Oliver untangles myths and presents facts through the lens of actual archeological evidence. Great moment (among many) in the first episode, when Oliver asks a librarian in France if the book of ""lost"" records of Kings could be returned to Scotland. Oliver vividly unearths epic battles too long forgotten, like the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, a turning point in history.

Scotland's landscape is beautifully filmed, and the maps are a treat. Thankfully, Scotland's Biggest Liar, Sir Walter Scott, is revealed as a spin-maker, notorious bigot, and sycophant to the King; he was also a raving antisemite. The series lacks a few points of focus, oddly omitting portraits of historic figures, images which would have helped flesh out the characters. As well, it's never mentioned is that the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, Lord Darley, helped kill Mary's advisor, prior to his own murder. The series runs out of steam towards the conclusion, rapidly skipping through the Battle of Culloden. The final episode drags on interminably, splicing repetitive scenes together: slow-motion shots of factory furnaces imploding, molten steel pouring, depressing old guys in an old-folks bar, and the cracked asphalt of a bleak urban landscape. There is no full-circle to conclude, no completion with scenes of The Stone of Destiny being returned to a renewed Scottish nation.

Overall, this is a great series, wish it could have been longer; perhaps towards the end funding ran short. Neil Oliver is an excellent narrator, who has worked at Scotland's Kilmartin site, near Dunadd, the seat of the Kingdom of Dl Riata.

The story told punctures some myths, fills in the blanks, makes kings come alive, and tells a very human tale.  Some events, such as the Battle of Culloden are not covered in detail as everyone knows about it, but the events leading up to the battle and the politics driving the history are illuminated in rich detail.
  As for Mr. Oliver, where did they get this guy?  If you called up central casting and said, ""Send me over a passionate Scot""  this is the laddie you'd get.
