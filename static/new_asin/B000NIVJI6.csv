8178080,3,B000NIVJI6,"The John Wayne Collection,Vol#2,is a release of Rio Grande(Nov./50),Dakota(Dec./45),The Fighting Kentuckian(Sept./49)and A Lady Takes A Chance(Aug/43).I have listed the films from the best to the worst and the transfer quality is listed similarly. These transfers/prints seem to be the same used for their VHS cousins a few years ago. Without exception a good remastering on all of these films wouldn't go amiss,but especially on the last two. Let's see where we stand with plots and ratings.
Rio Grande was the unintentional third Ford directed film in a trilogy they created together(Ford and Wayne).This film finds Wayne as an officer of the US Army cavalry heading up a post in Texas whose job it has been to try and catch marauding Indian bands who use Mexico as their point of egress and ingress. Thrown into this mix is his son,who failed at West Point,enlisting and being posted to his regiment. On top of this is the arrival of his mother to try to persuade her son and her husband(Wayne)to let him come home with her. The film is ably directed by Ford and co stars Victor McLachlin and the lovely and talented Maureen O'Hara. The best film of the collection hands down. 4 stars.
The Fighting Kentuckian finds Wayne in a Kentucky regiment who is smitten with a French born girl in Alabama. He parts and again meets her in her hometown of Demopolis. It seems a crook is envious of the land the French have been granted and has over the years had surveyors paid off to move land stakes. This would make the land vulnerable to takeover as the French are not where they should be. Wayne decides to stick around and help the French community fight when the time comes. Co-starring in this film,and what it is more than well known for,is the rare appearance of Oliver Hardy,without his long standing partner Stan Laurel. It was Stan who finally convinced Ollie to take the role. And Hardy is a wonderful actor for Wayne to play off of. 3 1/2 stars.
Dakota finds Wayne courting the same girl he did in the Fighting Kentuckians,Vera Ralston(who bears a slight resemblance to Paulette Goddard,without her superior acting skills!).Her father owns a railroad and she overhears his plans to go to the Dakotas and buy land cheaply for the railroad. Wayne and Ralston decide to head out and buy it before her dad does,so her dad will have to bargain with them. They arrive out west to find the settlers are under some pressure from local thugs to give up their land,peaceably or by force. Wayne steps in to right the wrongs. Along with Wayne is Walter Brennan as a cantankerous riverboat captain and Mike Mazursky is on hand as one of the toughs. Barely 3 stars.
A Lady Takes a Chance stars Jean Arthur with the Duke(that's his film name here).Jean has a how hum love life back in New York so decides to head west to get a little action. She runs into a rodeo rider,the hunky Wayne and is instantly smitten. She tags along with Wayne and the two fall in and out of love throughout the film. In the end,just as we think Wayne finally gave her the gate,he sweeps her off her feet(literally)back in New York and takes her back west to wed. It is quite the overtly sexual film for the 40s as we watch Arthur on the prowl for love,it is just too bad the plot doesn't live up to its potential. 2 1/2 stars.
Technically speaking the best of the bunch,picture wise,is Rio Grande,but even this print could use some remastering. With it are two featurettes on the film's making which are good;the only special features in the box set. From here the prints go downhill until ""Lady"" and that is an abominable print. I know this is a public domain flick but I am shocked Republic(or maybe I'm not, considering their track record) would put out a film with this poor a quality print,it deserves better,they ALL do. Republic just isn't known for their high quality DVD releases.
All in all Rio Grande and The Fighting Kentuckian are the movies worth getting here,the others are absolutely passable and less. The overall quality of the DVDs/prints is good to mainly poor. What can one expect when you have such a low price for a set like this. It is a let down to be sure.",1337817600,5,4151,4.603238866396761

8178082,1,B000NIVJI6,"I did the exact same thing as the other reviewer.  I read all the reviews about the movies Big Jake, The Shootist, etc., the only John Wayne movies I was even interested in, thinking those were in this collection. Now I'm literally furious that I bought this movie collection.  I've noticed that amazon has removed all of those reviews now. WHY.  WHY.  WHY would you write reviews about 4 specific movies that had nothing to do with this collection.",1295568000,5,449,4.6455696202531644

The Sons of Katie Elder
John Wayne recovered from his first bout with cancer to appear in this 1965 film as the brother of Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson Jr. All four characters are wandering souls prone to trouble, but after the funeral of their frontier mother, they set out to avenge her death. Directed by Henry Hathaway (Wayne's director on True Grit), the film moves like a conventional, latter-day Western, with good performances from Wayne and Martin, who'd already costarred with the Duke in Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo. Nice support from Dennis Hopper (who had a legendary conflict with Hathaway on this film), Strother Martin, and George Kennedy. --Tom Keogh
Big Jake
Big Jake (1969) is not one of the Duke's classics, but a diverting attempt nonetheless. Everyone seems to think that Jacob McCandles is six feet under (""I thought you was dead"" is a running line throughout), so some bad men kidnap his grandson. They want a piece of the family fortune and will kill to get it. Patrick Wayne, the Duke's own son, plays one of Big Jake's kids, and together they start out after the boy's abductors. Richard Boone makes a worthy adversary to Jake's larger-than-life figure, and the final confrontation between the two contains some great gritted-teeth dialogue. Maureen O'Hara is barely in the feature, sharing the same fate as Bobby Vinton as the boy's father. He seems to be onscreen just to get shot. --Keith Simanton
The Shootist
The last film of John Wayne could not have been more fitting, full of details that can't help but make one reflect upon his legacy in the movies and his life as a star. Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer. Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the great Man Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news. Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) thoughtfully directs a very special and sensitive production. --Tom Keogh",1294963200,2,2643,4.758169934640523
