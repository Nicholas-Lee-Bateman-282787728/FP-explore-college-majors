8417420,3,B0046QHTJE,"I hesitate to give a so-so rating to any OFAH episode, but this movie-length feature could have been trimmed by 15 minutes to improve its pacing. Since most of the action occurs away from Nelson Mandela House, some OFAH purists might miss the familiar, small-scale domestic feel that this film has traded for the road and sea. Given the high stakes of diamond smuggling, the sense of drama is much heavier than a typical light-hearted OFAH episode, and is heightened by Slater's cunning presence. Some conversations, like those with Uncle Albert on the boat, are milked too long and yield few laughs, unless you like Three Stooges-style banter. Nevertheless, all the boys do their best with this long script. The film's last fifteen minutes are the pay-off, when all the laboriously-set plot devices finally click to produce a climax that ranks among the best in the entire series.",1291507200,,881,4.95945945945946
