The characters and the dialouge are just so funny,that I find myself laughing all the way through the movie,everytime I watch it lol I especially love the scene,where they get into a fight infront of a McDonald's lol That was a trip! Buy this,if you want a good laugh at a crappy film.",1339977600,,421,4.410256410256411
1884557,3,B00009MEBV,"A while ago, I purchased a bundle of movies, among them some outwardly strange titles. I thought that ""American Kickboxer 2"" here would be my cushion to the weirdness - a no-brains martial arts B-movie I could fall back on when Tsui Hark and the rest got too much for me. Little did I suspect that this largely-unknown karate adventure would end up being the outright craziest film of the bunch, thanks to an unusually outlandish script coupled with the general insanity that comes with any made-in-the-Philippines fare. I wouldn't pit it against, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;in terms of apparent insanity of the filmmakers, but it came close to beating that one's record for me WTFing at my TV screen.

The story: when the daughter of a wealthy socialite (Kathy Shower,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Further-Adventures-Of-Tennessee-Buck/dp/B000KLWXH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Further Adventures Of Tennessee Buck</a>) is kidnapped and held for ransom, she calls upon her ex-husband (Dale Cook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raw-Target/dp/B00008G8NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raw Target</a>) and former boyfriend (Evan Lurie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hologram-Man/dp/B000EXDRMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hologram Man</a>) to help her ensure her daughter's safety.

Shoot, what an insane screenplay these guys had to work with. It really doesn't seem intentional, either: a lot of the nonsense the script has the actors say or do probably sounded a lot better in the heads of the writers than it looks on the screen. It chooses to introduce the character of Dale Cook - the film's hero, mind you - as a wife beater, while Evan Lurie's character simply starts speaking German in his third scene without reason. Kathy Shower attempts to motivate both of them by convincing them that her daughter is, in fact, their own biological child as well, making the movie sort of a martial arts version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-s-Day/dp/6304584210/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father's Day</a>. The script then completely detaches its characters from reality: Kathy Shower and her husband (David Graf,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Academy-series/dp/B0001907DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Academy series</a>) find time to bicker about her having an affair in the middle of their daughter's kidnapping, Evan and Dale have an impromptu encounter in front of a McDonald's and decimate an innocent bystander, and neither Evan nor Dale question it when director/weirdo Jeno Hodi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metamorphosis/dp/B003P6PWAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metamorphosis</a>) shows up from out of nowhere during their moment of need and helps them, distracting an enemy by placing cockroaches on his leg. There's more, and you have to believe that stuff like this made sense to *somebody* before it was put to celluloid...

Disappointingly, the movie really works better as an example of weirdo cinema than as a martial arts flick, since the fight scenes aren't all that great. Pleased as punch as I was to see the perpetually underrated henchbeast Evan Lurie in a starring role - as a good guy, no less - and even though he and Dale Cook have some good forms (Evan inches out Dale, who looks stiff on occasion), the camerawork, choreography, and cutting of the fights isn't in their favor. I wouldn't call it awful - especially the somewhat decent brawl the two have in fighting off a bunch of thugs in a warehouse - but the action certainly could be better, considering that the kicking cast also seems to include an uncredited Kris Aguilar (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>). However, what the fights lack in quality they make up for in quantity: the movie's latter 45 minutes slowly build up to an almost nonstop action centerpiece, inclusive of plenty of gunfighting. I dub it decent, overall, but wouldn't compare it favorably to its prequel-in-name-only,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer-1/dp/B000AYEL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer 1</a>.

Surprisingly, the movie has some decent production values on its side, considering where it was filmed. Dale Cook's flicks tend to be very blatant bottom-of-the-barrel overseas production, but here you actually forget that you're in Southeast Asia, at times. This helps give the film an extra nudge up the rating scale, and I give it a passing grade out of sheer entertainment value. Evan Lurie made plenty of better flicks, but aspiring Dale Cook fans can start with this one as much as any other film.",1305158400,,5080,6.521481481481482

1884559,1,B00009MEBV,I was a fan of the first Kickboxer and regret making the decision that it would be worthwhile to get a 5 movie collection.  I remember it being as a better movie when I was a child.  Only serious collector's or martial arts fans should buy this set.,1222646400,,249,4.166666666666667
1884560,3,B00009MEBV,"As stated in its title, this is the 2nd film in the American Kickboxer series.  This is not the true sequal however, and has nothing to do whatsoever with the first movie.  Its sequal is actually titled ""To The Death"".  Now that that is cleared up, this film is rather ok overall.

This is a low budget film starring Dale Cook (Blood Ring, Trple Impact, Raw Target) and Evan Lurie (Martial Law II, Tiger Claws 2, T-Force.  If Dale Cook is in it, you can expect lower than your average quality b-action movie.  American Kickboxer 2, however, is one of his best films.  If it were not for the horrible acting and ridiculous charcaters throughout the film, this could have rated even higher.

The story is about the kidnapping of a young girl, from her mother and stepfather.  The mother calls in her ex-husband and ex-lover to assist.  One is a cop and the other is a kickboxer.  The focus is around these two guys attepting to get along while trying to work together to resuce the girl.  The end actually has a bit of a twist, and there is the curiosity of discovering who the real father of the girl is, as it has never been discovered prior.

The last 45 minutes of this film is non-stop fighting.  I would say the fights are not very exciting, but there are a heck of a lot of them.  From a small gladiator set-up, to a finale on the beach, there's a little bit of everything.

Unfortunately, the production value of this film is weak.  The acting is very poor and most of the cast are just cheesy and silly.  Tons of action if you are into that, but don't expect any thrilling fights.",1187827200,,1587,4.3583617747440275
1884561,2,B00009MEBV,"I will admit right off the bat that I am a B-Movie fan when it comes to action films. I especially like b-action movie franchises. I own the American Ninja series, The Delta Force trilogy, Missing in Action trilogy, etc. I liked the Kickboxer films and I always ment to get them on DVD but I kept putting them off. When I heard there was a DVD box set coming out I quickly pre-ordered the item without knowing the nature of the set. I came out extremely disappointed.

First off this box set contains NO special features. I didn't expect there to be (I mean come on...this is the Kickboxer franchise not Star Wars) but I know some people out there are wondering. All the films are also in Full Screen. Again I expected this as films of this nature very rarely get the widescreen treatment. So what was I so disappointed in?

Well, I was disappointed in the packaging of the movies. All five discs are housed in a cheap, poorly made fold out case. I was hoping each film would come in their own seperate keep case or even perhapes those slim cases manufacturing companies are starting to use in box sets. Not the ""case"" here. It's a lot like the case of the Alien Quadrilogy just more poorly made. The case is so poorly made that the spindles that hold the discs keep breaking during shipping and the discs come dislodged and in the mean time get scratched. I hard to have it shipped and returned twice.

Overall it seems NO effort went into this box set and Lions Gate Entertainment just seemed to want to make it as cheap as possible. I figured I was saving money with this box set as it retails for $29.99 (A few bucks cheaper here on amazon). This is not the case. If you buy each film seperatly (Kickboxer 3 & 4 come in a double feature)it comes to a total of around $33. For me its worth the few extra bucks just to get each film in it's seperate case instead of this cheap cardboard box set. I say skip out on the box set and just buy the films seperatly.",1146355200,16,1961,4.266129032258065
1884562,3,B00009MEBV,"ha. I'm the 1st review huh? okay... well if you bought this set than you pretty much know what you were getting into. This is the original Kickboxer (Van-Damme) and all 4 of it's sequels.

I love the original Kickboxer! Van-Damme movies might be cheesy, but thereS something about the 80's feel and those lame unappropriate 80's love ballads that make this an action classic.

Kickboxer 2: is a great Revenge story following David Sloane (SASHA MITCHEL) Avenging the short and pointless Death of his brother Kurt (Van-Damme).

K3: While lacking the spark the series once had, is still a good movie.

K4: decided to take the series darker by making David an unemotional fighting zombie out for revenge against TONG-PO (...again...) this time after his wife has been kidnapped... it seems like a thrown together story that the actors didn't even seem to interested in.

K5: tried to ressurrect the series casting a new hero to replace David Sloane (who also is written off quickly).

I enjoyed the series and for $25 was worth getting to update my worn out VHS tapes. However, if you have them already seperately on DVD I'd avoid this collection at all costs! as it doesn't provide any new material. no special features at all!",1145491200,8,1225,4.781990521327014
1884563,4,B00009MEBV,"I liked this movie because it had lots of martial arts action. The plot is about a kidnapped daughter, Lillian (Kathy Shower) is the mother of the daughter and turns to two men who she knows she can count on to help her. One of the men is Mike(Dale 'apollo' Cook)a hard-nosed L.A cop with a reputation of doing things his own way: the hard way. The other man is her former lover David (Evan Lurie) a martial arts expert whose exsplosive temper is a lethal compliment to his formidable skill in kikcboxing. After Lillians daughter is kidnapped the kidnapper Xavier (Ted Markland) will release the kid for a $2 million dollar ransom.",1131408000,,631,4.592920353982301
1884564,3,B00009MEBV,As the heading says but also quite engrossing too. The viewer does get to know the characters even though much of the film is action. Ironic I know but I have seen slower films that are less engaging both darmatically and emotionally. So it's not a classic but if watched on a staurday afternoon or a tuesday night I guarentee you could spend an hour or two less usefully.  The word fun is inadequate and too shiny a phrase perhaps. I would say the word that sums this film up is 'crunchy'. umm... nice contrast of expressions.  Look out for the incredible Kathy Shower looking stunning as per usual...,976752000,4,602,4.513761467889908

1884579,4,B00009MEBV,"If i had saw these reviews first, i probably would have never watched this movie. In the end, the movie was on TV a long time ago and i loved it. I knew Apollo from the martials arts tourney circuts and i knew of evan lurie in the acting world and martial arts world. The martial arts are my favorite thing about this. I do agree that apollo can't act very well. but as with popular opinion he acts better than jason David Frank ever could. If you watch this you won't be watching it for the acting, you'll be watching it for the fights and the fights not only between the two men but also against the bad guys are what made me love this movie.",1403568000,,644,4.078740157480315

1884583,1,B00009MEBV,"I grew up watching TGIF, bc we didn't have satellite then. Step by Step was one of those shows, but I did like it, as their were so many different personalities going on there. I kind of gave this movie a chance bc of the reputation of the 1st movie plus I liked certain parts. I felt that this guy had martial arts ability, bc I remember one episode of the said show where he was protected Dana and kicked through this vending machine in much the way that one with talent would; boy, was I wrong! The guy that he was tutoring in the movie had much more ability than he had. This guy--Mitchell--was slow plus he had awkward moves. The only redeeming quality that he had was that great reach that he had, but--with his failings as a fighter--a good fighter would mop the floor with him and some average fighters could beat him. This movie was laughable and sooooooo bad!!!! First off, gave this one earlier! Second, the movie was not well written. Third,  it does not measure up as a sequel at all; would have been an itsy-bit better if they had made Mitchell their cousin or one of their best friends. This movie seems as though it should not have been made at all. What if they scrapped Mitchell and opted for Seagal or Rhee and have these guys be one of their friends out for revenge?! Fourth, Xien Chow had no place in the movie the way that it was written and it seemed that his role was limited also bc Mitchell had no skills to accomplish the regimen of a real fighter.  Fifth, his top student made a better title character than he does. Sixth,  he seems foreign or missing without the cast of the said sitcom above(who were--for the most part--some really good actors and actresses, 3 or 4 already had major acting experience prior to the sitcom). Seventh, fight scenes were the worse of any martial arts movie ever! Ever!!! Eighth,  Tong Po played a really good part in the first movie(who could forget the line: ""you bleed like Mylee, Mylee good ...""), but he seemed like he was through with acting and the makeup was awfully done, too! Ninth, there's no way that Tong Po could  take the damage from the young phenom on 'roids(esp. when Van Damme destroyed him with little effort when he really wanted to and without 'roids)--as Rocky should not have been able to in Rocky IV from the already mountainous Drago . Tenth, there are some actors in this movie who have a reputation for doing good work, but the writers and/or director did such a bad job with these actors that their abilties were badly wasted. This movie was so bad that there are probably others that you'll find! I DO NOT recommend unless you like being super bored while wasting your time!!! Stay away!!!! Should be condemned!!! Should not have been made as constructed!!!! Would give a negative figure if I could!!!! This is a movie that has no redeemable qualities; a movie could not be that bad; could it? Ripley's Believe It or Not!!!! Believe it or waste your time and money with it!!!!",1358208000,,2966,4.464944649446495
