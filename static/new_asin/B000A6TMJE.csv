8075100,5,B000A6TMJE,I don't think the one star reviewer is being entirely honest about his hidden intentions in bashing this DVD in how he promoted another's work. I watched this instructional DVD and found it quite helpful and professional.  People don't generally put together poor quality DVD's and sell them for $36 on eBay if they expect to make money.,1227744000,3,337,4.810344827586207
