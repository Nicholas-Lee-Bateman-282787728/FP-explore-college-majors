8522196,4,B007VFF7LE,"For some reason it was difficult to find all 4 of these shows individually.  Not sure why some cost way more than others.  For this reason, and despite already owning two of the four mini-movies, I purchased this set.  It was less expensive than sourcing and buying the remaining two shows individually.  Save yourself the nuisance of trying to collect the individual shows and buy this set with all four discs included, for about half the price of all discs individually.  It's perfect for kids 6 and older - younger kids might not fully understand the bickering/broodish behaviour of some of the characters.  Very well produced for a kids show I might add!",1405382400,,658,4.778761061946903
8522197,5,B007VFF7LE,"I'm not sure what to say really. I never heard of this cartoon series, didn't know it existed. Somehow it got into my house, and my kids (2 & 4 yrs old) would want to watch it over and over again. So much that we had to go and buy the entire 4 disc series.

What is funny, is many times the adults end up watching it too, just to see what happens. It's a mash of Fast N Furious, The Matrix, and The Terminator in a cartoon. If you watch it, you'll see what I mean.

When I make my millions, I'd like to find out where the rights are sitting for this thing, because I'd love to get the concluding series done (yes, there is a cliffhanger ending).",1389398400,,645,3.953846153846154

8522199,5,B007VFF7LE,"Each one of our three boys loved these movies.  Our oldest got the first ""Hot Wheels - World Race"" movie when he was 4 and then over the next few years we got the rest.  If you look on E-bay or wherever, you can find cars that match the movie characters cars which are awesome gifts!  Later, his younger brother got into it...and then the youngest.  I can repeat too many of the phrases from this movie since I have heard them so many times!!",1365552000,,442,4.1647058823529415
