8487633,5,B005VU55JU,"The collection is not mainstream except for the PD version of a Rathbone film. However, this is what makes it so unique. Sherlockians have all heard about the ""mastery"" with which Arthur Wontner and Ellie Norwood engineer their roles as Sherlock. While good, one can see the mastery Basil Rathbone brought to the character.  Three of Norwood's four available films are included along with some other interesting television roles, film parodies, etc.

Overall the Archive Collection is very-very good and provides the viewer with material that would be difficult to come by otherwise.",1380672000,2,583,5.258064516129032
8487634,4,B005VU55JU,"As a Sherlock Holmes fan I was dieing to get my hands on this collection.  It was great fun to finally watch the three short films that starred the great Ellie Norwood (who was a Conan Doyle favorite actor at the time) and to finally see SHERLOCK HOLMES'S FATAL HOUR (the first of five films starring Arthur Wotner). I think someone needs to bring out more Ellie Norwood films from the 20's out on DVD, and the complete (well the surviving four films anyway) of Arthur Wotner.  Anyway the rest of the collection is ok. You do need to be a big SHERLOCK HOLMES and mystery fan to really enjoy this collection, since I am a fan of both I did enjoy it and now I have to great actors to put on my list of favorite holmes actors, along with JEREMY BRETT and BASIL RATHBONE.",1332892800,5,767,4.2465753424657535
