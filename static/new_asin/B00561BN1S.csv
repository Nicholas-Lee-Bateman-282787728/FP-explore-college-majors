4582317,2,B00561BN1S,I loved the girls next door so much I still watch them to date! But I never got into this show! I don't know if it was because there was no more Hef or no more playboy mansion or what.! Holly was always my favorite and has such a funny quirky personality but this new hollys world show and the setting didn't appeal to me! Im pretty sure it was just the huge difference life had on her after she left the mansion!!,1347321600,5,414,4.0
4582318,5,B00561BN1S,"Love Holly Madison & missed this show when it was on TV. So glad I found the DVD's and was able to purchase them grom a great seller with a good price. Have loved watching every episode of Holly's World! Wish the show was still on, especially now that she's pregnant!",1347148800,2,267,4.254901960784314
4582319,4,B00561BN1S,I was always a big fan of Holly from the girls next door and this really let me see another side to her personality. It was refreshing to get another look at someone you look up too. She really is super nice and caring.,1340841600,,219,4.0
4582320,4,B00561BN1S,"I am NOT a Playboy fan.
I started watching The Girls Next Door in early 2009.  Became a fan because I liked Bridget & Holly.

I do enjoy the show.  Here it is uncut so we get the language.  Good the episodes are wide screen.

The seasons were TOO SHORT.  Favorite episode in season one was Bridget's episode where the take the trip. And, I agree with what Holly said, her bobble head looked like a man.

Of course season two as short as it was is better.  We got to see the whole Hef getting engaged to ""The Runaway Bride"".  The other parts this season is that Jadye person causing problems and the fight with Angel and Josh finding his real mother.

You can tell some of this is staged.  Good to see Vegas

What a cheap DVD package.  The same photo of her on all three DVD's.  NO episode information listed anywhere.  A disappointment-no commentary

I hope further seasons of the show have more episodes",1325289600,2,904,4.323353293413174
4582321,5,B00561BN1S,"I think this is one of the best shows on TV and I cannot WAIT for a new season. Holly has really grown on me, but I love Josh and the assistant best. I really dislike Laura and the new mean-girl Playmate Jayde. She is so annoying and I was glad when she got punched. This show is definitely a guilty pleasure, so if you like to laugh and scream out loud at gossipy fun shows, you will love this! So so so much fun. I am shocked that I love it so much but I do!",1322784000,,460,3.752577319587629
4582322,5,B00561BN1S,Holly is great and Holly's World shows a completely other side than we saw in the Girls Next Door. Not less adorable but definitive less domestic ;-),1319414400,3,149,4.555555555555555
4582323,4,B00561BN1S,"Being both a Vegas freak and a Girls Next Door fan, I was very excited for Holly's World. Though the last season was heavier on the ""World"" and much lighter on ""Holly,"" the first two seasons of Holly's World are a blast, so I knew I'd be purchasing this DVD. This DVD contains both uncensored seasons of Holly's World, some deleted scenes, outtakes and the music video that the group made called ""Report to the Floor"" and a super teaser for the season.

I do have a few complaints about the set, but they are minor: I wish that there was commentary on the discs. The commentary on the Girls Next Door DVDs have become some of my favorite parts of the entire series - it is so much fun to hear the behind-the-scenes activity. Also, the first episode feels very low-budget and it really comes across in the DVD. Other than that, this is a great set.

Holly fans, snatch this up. You won't be disappointed.",1317168000,12,903,4.401197604790419
4582324,5,B00561BN1S,"At first I wasn't very sure about Holly having her own reality show, because everybody was used to see her with Hef, or as the main girl of the Girls Next Door, but this show finally worked out.
Holly's reality show is amazing, because you can see another side of Holly that wasn't never seen before... actually, you can see the real one.
And her co-stars have something that gives the show a fresh taste.
I hope this show lasts more than 3 seasons, because Holly's life in Las Vegas gets exciting more everytime.",1311897600,6,513,4.468085106382978
4582355,5,B00561BN1S,"I love Holly and anything having to do with her. A fantastic series, I wish there was more of it. Josh is so talented! Holly is fun, smart, amazing. I loved watching her come into her own, and be free, not held back by the Playboy enterprise. Fun, easy going show. I love to watch and rewatch.",1452470400,,293,4.157894736842105
4582356,5,B00561BN1S,"I love Holly Madison and was so excited to get this DVD for the holiday season at such a low price. The DVD came on time, packaged very safely.

Hollys boobs! Love it!",1403654400,,127,4.333333333333333
4582398,4,B00561BN1S,"4 stars...not the best show anyone could choose to watch, but it was interesting and some episodes I will watch again. Also beats most modern reality tv by a long shot.

I like that for the most part they keep it real, some of the stuff did look a little staged but to see the emotion of each character on a small portion of their journey was interesting. I won't say much so I don't ruin the show.

I would reccomend the show for anyone looking for a laugh, a cry. Anyone that followed Holly Madison in her Playboy days and wants to know what she did after. Or, for Broadway fans....get some insight into Josh Strickland's life (and see him get crazy w/ Holly and the gang).",1402358400,,675,4.265625
4582399,4,B00561BN1S,"I am a huge fan of the Girls Next Door show, and was excited to find this. The show is great fun to watch and I really enjoy watching it over and over again, when I can get away from my kids. There is not a lot of nudity, which is great, but there is  no edited language option on the dvds, and the amount of language some times gets ridiculous. The characters are entertaining, and Angel is such a sweetie!! I didn't care for Laura Croft though, as she has this bimbo/airheaded thing going for her, and you can tell that some of its an act, but other times you want to reach thru the TV and shake her. Jade's character brings a little drama to the show, which is fun. All in all, if you likes the GND series, you'll enjoy this show. I just wish there were commentary and the option to edit the language on the disks. Does anyone know when season 3 will be out on DVD??",1390521600,2,869,4.0523255813953485

4582401,3,B00561BN1S,I really love this show but the dvds had a lot of scratches on them and caused a couple episodes to skip and I couldn't watch the full episodes but other than that the rest of the episodes worked fine but I was kind of dissapointed to wait that long and not be able to watch every single episode,1368748800,,295,4.016949152542373
