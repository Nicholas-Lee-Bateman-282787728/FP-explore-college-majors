3498384,1,B001BSBBL2,"Really a snooze fest. NO MUSIC! Hardly even a soundtrack. Starts off with 45 minutes of the same thing - traveling, screaming girls, interviews about their hair. Would like my money back.",1369267200,,187,4.875

3498386,5,B001BSBBL2,"The Beatles Explosion is a behind the scenes documentary of the rise and continued success of the Beatles.  Some of the material the hardcore fan is likely to have seen before, but quite a bit of it is relatively unique to this feature, and consequently should be of interest to anyone with more than a passing curiosity in the Beatles.

One thing worth a special mention is the inclusion of a colorized clip of the Fab Four performing a melodramatic (to great humor) interpretation of Shakespeare on a British TV program, something that I guarantee American audiences haven't seen before and something that is certainly worth picking up!

All in all, a solid package for all of us living on that yellow submarine.",1228348800,23,714,4.788617886178862

8284565,5,B001BSBBL2,"""God bless you.  You've got a lucky face.  The end.""  -- John Lennon, 1964

This delightful documentary takes readers on an early bird Magical Mystery Tour (oops - that's not until 1967) with the Beatles on their meteoric rise to fame!  No doubt much of the material will be familiar to inveterate, rabid Beatlemaniacs, but even so it will always be a treat to watch.

Fans will have a bit of a giggle seeing the Beatles spoof on the Bard in period piece costumes.  John was a riot in drag with that hideous stiff wig and George, in pajamas and a stocking cap ""sitting high on top of his wavy haired head"" was especially adorable.  (For fans who have read biographies of the Beatles, George's funny cap will remind them of how Louise Harrison said in an interview that when George was a teen he let his long wavy hair grow and he would leave with his school cap sitting high on top of his head and some outfit he had customized to his specific taste.)  Yes, the boys were adorable and lots of fun.  Fans will certainly sing along with the fab 4!",1439856000,,1045,4.34020618556701

8284567,5,B001BSBBL2,"Great documentary, with very rare video from over 50 years ago!  Entertaining.  We did find it odd that none of the Beatles original music serves as a soundtrack, not even covers by other musician....  Perhaps the filmmakers could not obtain the right??",1426723200,3,253,4.976190476190476
8284568,3,B001BSBBL2,"interesting little doco , only true fans should check this out, I quite enjoyed it but don't expect brilliant sound or vision, it is what it is , bits from here bits from there, like I said about the queen concert 74, its Nostalgic , view it on that basis and you won't be disappointed",1421107200,2,285,4.2
