959759,3,6305069131,"The Brazilian village of Agreste is such a backwater that electricity is cut-off at 9:00 PM. So, it's a Communal Big Deal when a bright red sports car roars into town. From behind the wheel uncurls gorgeous and flamboyant Tieta (Sonia Braga). She's accompanied by Leonora (Claudia Abreu), introduced as her stepdaughter.
Twenty-six years previous, the teenaged TIETA OF AGRESTE was thrown out by Dad after Tieta's sister accused her of sexual promiscuity. Tieta fled to Sao Paolo, where she's lived and prospered ever since, most recently as the ostensible wife of a wealthy industrialist. Despite the rancor surrounding her departure decades earlier, Tieta has been periodically sending money to her Agreste family. She now lets slip that she misses ""her girls"" back in Sao Paolo, and leads her family to believe that she owns a luxury shop of some sort. Fate has treated Tieta well, and she's not above gently rubbing the noses of her now-aged father Ze (Chico Anysio) and her avaricious and widowed sister Perpetua (Marilia Pera) in her success. Tieta soon proves she has influence in high places when she arranges with casual ease to have streetlights and 7/24 electricity installed in Agreste. At this point, the viewer might be forgiven any questions about the perhaps dubious nature of Tieta's girls and her ""luxury shop"".
I wanted to like this film more than I ultimately did. Certainly, the very best reason to see it is Sonia Braga, who proves that a 46-year old woman can still be a Hottie. Oh my, is she ever. Indeed, her Tieta character wastes no time in showing Perpetua's eldest son Cardo (Heitor Mello), a young seminarian, that perhaps he's really not cut out for celibate priesthood. A variation of the famous Mae West line comes to mind: ""Is that a candlestick in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?""
From the very moment Tieta blows into town, by which time the viewer knows the story of her previous banishment, there's obviously the potential for a good revenge story. And revenge is a dish best eaten cold. I would've hoped that Tieta keep her cool, but a shrill screaming match between her and the embittered Perpetua late in the film put that possibility to rest and brought to mind ""overacting"" with a capital ""O"". Perhaps it's the fiery Latin temperament. Moreover, there were two subplots, one involving a budding affair between Leonora and a minor village functionary, and the other revolving around the prospective purchase of a local pristine beach by a polluting industrial giant. Both were virtually non-sequiturs, and also prolonged the run time unnecessarily to almost two hours.
Unless you're a Sonia Braga fan or an aficianado of Brazilian cinema, TIETA OF AGRESTE is a take-it or leave-it affair. But whether Tieta is a blonde, brunette, or redhead, she's a sexy eyeful.",1060128000,17,2818,4.9222689075630255
959760,4,6305069131,"The book (by Jorge Amado) should be read before seeing the movie.
I did enjoy the movie, but this is one of those wonderful books that could never fully be captured on film (though I do have to say the casting was great all around -- will have to reread the book again now that I have the picture of Sonia Braga as Tieta in my head).
A great movie... if you read the book... but... I think it would be a lot harder to follow without the knowledge of the book.  (It doesn't contradict the book, it's just a lot less complex a story than the book, but that's the nature of distilling a 400 page book into a 2 hour movie.)",1023753600,5,619,4.032520325203252
959761,4,6305069131,"This is a very entertaining movie - but let me say what it is basically about since no-one has.  Sonia Braga plays the role of a very assertive and ""successful"" woman who returns to the place of her up-bringing after her husband dies.  It had been years since she was cast away.  Where she grew up, the countryside of Brasil, is very much like the way she left it only people are a bit older - yet the core remains the same.  From the moment she arrives, she turns the small village upside down and creates a slew of mischeif here and there with her family and old friends.
Enjoyable and surprising (in a way) ending and Sonia Braga displayed the true fire of the Brasileira.",1008028800,17,675,4.333333333333333
959762,5,6305069131,"I'm a new fan of Brazilian cinema.  Carlos Diegues is a true Brazilian director.  He does a good job at producing a movie which captures the sensuality of Brazil without going overboard with explicit scenes.  It's a beautiful movie with the help of Sonia Braga who is not only a great actress, but a beautiful woman.  After seen Diegues' other film, Bye Bye Brazil, you can tell he knows about capturing the Brazilian mentality.",1006128000,5,428,4.743243243243243
959763,4,6305069131,"Great entertainment, viewed it in portuguse more than 4 times.

7882103,5,6305069131,"I loved Amado's book, and love this movie immensely. I never get tired of watching the DVD and admire the acting prowess of Marilia Pera, who plays Perpetua so well, with her incredible expressions, gestures and demeanor. Sonia Braga is and acts magnificent (her laugh in the awkward situations is so liberating). The soundtrack is great. The atmosphere in the rural town is captivating. I also love Carmosita and all other characters.

I'm Italian, my ex Brazilian boyfriend introduced me to the movie and other pieces Brazilian culture; by reading the book and rereading pieces here and there and watching the movie over and over again I basically learnt a great deal of Portuguese having so much fun.

7882104,4,6305069131,"This review refers to the DVD(Fox Lorber) edition of ""Tieta of Agreste""

Tieta is brash and sassy. She's worldly and flashy, beautiful and wealthy. She wasn't always all these things though. Banished from her poor, small village for her promiscuity years before, she now returns to show them all!
The family that once shunned her, now embraces her...and her money!

As she makes her entrance back into the tiny town in her flashy red car, the villagers welcome her back with open arms(as does the audience). She is their savior. Her money will bring the village the much needed electricity they have been doing without. Along with her is another beautiful woman. The young,demure Lenora, introduced as Tieta's stepdaughter. Their presence shakes up the this quiet, remote Brazilian village,and not even a seminary student is safe from Tieta's charms. These women have a secret though...one that may send them packing once more!

Directed by Carlos Diegues, and set in the most beautiful locale, the story and the characters will definately have you smiling throughout. But it is Sonia Braga who carries this film on her lovely shoulders to make it the engaging delight that it is. She turns in an electrifying portrayal of Tieta and her screen presence is mesmerizing.

The film is in Portuguese with English subititles. The DVD  presents a very nice letterboxed picture and has very good sound in stereo. There is a short featurette on the making of ""Tieta"" and some filmographies.

A nice film to add to your foreign film collection, one that will certainly have repeated viewings. Four stars for this fine Brazilian entry,one of which shines brightly for Sonia Braga!

Enjoy....Laurie

7882105,2,6305069131,"Another one of those books that didn't translate well to the bring screen. In Brazil they frequently make mini-series based on famous works of literature; in such a format, there's a lot more time to develop a work of the complexity of ""Tieta do Agreste"". In fact, there has been a mini-series made of this novel in Brazil, but I haven't seen it. However, from seeing other Brazillian mini-series made of other Jorge Amado novels (of which there have been probably a dozen), I can say that they have tended to come across better than a hour-and-a-half to two hour movie; that simply is not enough time to present any of the longer novels of Amado. In the case of this movie, the focus is primarily on the relationship between Tieta and her nephew, while the main plot of the novel, the machinations of unscrupulous industrialists to locate a highly toxic titanium oxide plant in the middle of a pristine tropical paradise, is almost an afterthought. The cinematography may be beautiful, and Sonia Braga never looked more gorgeous, but if you've read the wonderful novel, it's just not enough! Altogether disappointing.",1074816000,5,1118,4.858638743455497
7882106,3,6305069131,"Adapted from Jorge Amado's well known book of the same name, this should have been much better considering its source, director Carlos Diegus's earlier films, and a soundtrack by Caetano Veloso.... Sadly it's an average film, with a handful of well known Brazilian actors and some nice locations-- nothing more. You'll watch this once but probably never need to again. The problem is partly that Amado's books are hard to condense in under two hours and his books tend to include a lot characters' inner thoughts and dialogue that are hard to translate onto film when you consider most of his books average 500 pages or more. There are also a handful of grammatical & spelling mistakes in the English subtitles which could be either funny or annoying depending on your mood that day... Mildly entertaining but nothing special.",1069459200,6,826,4.9496402877697845
