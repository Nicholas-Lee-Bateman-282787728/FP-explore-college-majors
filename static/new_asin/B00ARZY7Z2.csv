8557280,3,B00ARZY7Z2,"I hate to say bad things about a pack of movies. some are good some are ok and some you cant even watch because they are so bad. The Italian or spaghetti westerns in this bundle are really BAD. the acting is horrible and the themes are bad. One is a futuristic film, Id hardly call it a western. The others how ever are fair to good.  They are low budget or ones that Didnt make it to the big screen. Clint Walker was a nice surprise. so 5 watchable ones out of 8. its up to you but if I were you Id pass.",1392595200,5,505,3.8095238095238093
