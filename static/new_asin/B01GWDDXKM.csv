8764034,4,B01GWDDXKM,"Not bad black-and-white early 60's English-dubbed Italian-Austrian made horror film.  Shows its Germanic roots.  The sets, actors, moody atmosphere and spooky music makes it seem like a West German Edgar Wallace mystery film.  A werewolf is stalking the grounds of a girls' reformatory.  It never goes near the dormitory.  There is no lack of suspects among the faculty.  The Retromedia DVD is very good quality.  The famed ""Ghoul in School"" song was never heard by myself, at least in this release.  Highly recommended.",1518220800,,520,5.180722891566265
