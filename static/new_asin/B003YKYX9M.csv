4230755,5,B003YKYX9M,"Moving and inspiring portrayal of Lois Burnham Wilson's struggles through  her marriage to Bill,who suffers from alcoholism. Her undying faith in God and Bill are amazing to see on the screen. The strength that both Lois and Bill had to reach recovery for themselves was amazing. Then to go on and bring hope,inspiration,relief and grace to other's who have suffered and are suffering with the addiction to alcohol or is a family member of someone with this addiction is truly inspiring. Faith in God and a gift to the world from God to see how Bill and Lois transformed their personal hell into charity towards the neighbor is beyond inspiring. Thank you Bill Borchert for writing this and Hallmark for producing.

4230799,5,B003YKYX9M,"I enjoyed this biography of the wife of one of the founders of AA. Learning about the origins and growth of AA from her perspective fascinated me. I was intrigued by how she came to create Al-anon by working with family members of people helped by AA. This true story was great! Lois Wilson tells of her husband's years of battle with alcoholism and how he founded AA after many, many years of being drunk. She tells the story through her eyes and all the struggles she went through until he became sober! It is an amazing story even if you don't know anyone with a drinking problem.  Very inspirational, especially considering the setting of this story. In the end, it truly is a love story about the founders of Al-Anon and Alcoholics Anonymous.",1458518400,,747,4.574626865671642

4230801,5,B003YKYX9M,"I'm a substance abuse counselor. This movie shows addiction from the perspective of a loved one, and tells the story of how Alcoholics Anonymous was formed.  You can find that all on ""My Name Is Bill W"" too, but this also demonstrates how codependency comes into being-how the other person can become just as addicted to the alcoholic and his problems as the alcoholic him/herself.  A great depiction of just how bad an alcoholic can get, how everything gets sacrificed in the course of addiction, and how no many promises made, pledges to God, this is a serious disease that is not easy to 'just say no' to.",1457222400,,608,4.62037037037037

She also works the steps in the movie after staying with Bill through the horrible parts of his disease and then her resentment at his commitment to recovery.  Really good acting and scenes.

4230855,5,B003YKYX9M,"I was very anxious to see this movie. I wanted to see the bio on the woman who was there from the beginning of Alcoholics Anonymous. The wife of Bill Wilson, the co-founder of A.A. I also bought the movie MY NAME IS BILL W.. Both Movies show how A.A. , the program that saved millions from the depths of Alcoholism got started. This movie takes you through days and years of how the Alcoholic AND the family member suffered the disease of Alcoholism along side each other. The dedication Lois W. had to her husband and to their commitment to each other. As Bill W. dives to the bottom of his disease, Lois W. hangs on with all the Hope and Faith she can muster up to stand by her man, even when family and friends are saying  'Get Out Now!"". She won't give up on Bill W. and then, through a spiritual experience, a miracle, Bill W. gets Sober. Even that part turns out to be a challenge to the marriage. It's one thing to live with a drunk and then to live with a drunk in Recovery, is two different worlds. The drunk world and the sober world, bringing the two worlds together - to help save others from the depths of alcoholism was the Purpose of this new found Program. One Alcoholic helping another Alcoholic through sharing their own Experiences, Strength and Hope with each other. At first Lois felt alot of mixed emotions about Bill W. new found sober world. A sober world she felt in competition with at times. His helping suffering Alcoholics wherever and whenever he could. Feeling left out. Till - She saw the Same Need for the Recovering family members as well. A Need to bridge the two worlds together for Their own understanding. She shared with the families her own Experiences, Strength and Hope and so the ALANON program was born. I am so grateful for her Courage and Strength, to overcome the years of suffering - to find her God Given Purpose. Using the same outline for recovery, used for the A.A. program. A.A and Alanon Programs brought together, Bringing Hope to many families in recovery to find Sobriety and Happiness together.  Winona Ryder plays Lois Wilson, convincing in her role. Barry Pepper plays Bill W., so convincing as a suffering Bill W.. Movie depicts an enduring Love Story that helped Save millions of people around the world in the throws of Alcoholism. My name is Laura Mc. a Recovering Alcoholic and a very Grateful Member of ALANON. These Programs worked for Me, Saved My LIFE. I have a Happy, Joyous and Free Life today. They can work for You as Well. This Movie is a wonderful and Inspiring inlet for learning about these Life Saving Programs.  The DVD is Great.

4230887,5,B003YKYX9M,"The movie explains why, and how Lois was able to live with and through all the episodes that her Alcoholic husband went thru and she was thinking that her support would save him. Well it could not, and did not. She was affected by all the activity and was in need of a support group of her own. Al-A-Non and other programs came as a result of all that happened.

4230888,4,B003YKYX9M,"If you are in a relationship with an alcoholic, you know how difficult it can be.  It's important to understand that it's not something that you have done and just because the alcoholic may love you and you love them, that doesn't necessarily help them be able to quit.  To quit drinking is a personal decision on the part of the alcoholic.  I would highly recommend Alanon meetings, which is what this movie is about.  Lois Wilson started the group after her husband became sober and she realized that only personal responsibility is the key to overcoming addiction and that it wasn't her fault.  She wasn't to blame for her husband's addiction and she wasn't responsible for his recovery.  Alanon has helped me understand that I am not a failure as a mom because of my son's problem.  Unconditional love without enabling is a key element in learning how to cope.  Let go and let God.",1394496000,21,885,4.628205128205129

4230897,5,B003YKYX9M,"This past decade has not been good to Winona Ryder.  I loved LOST SOULS (2000), but critics didn't.  After that Ryder appeared in the dreadful AUTUMN IN NEW YORK, and there followed many awful indie films and unfunny comedies, with Ryder often cast in small roles as an unlikeable, nasty, or crazy woman (SEX AND DEATH 101, THE TEN, THE INFORMERS).  Although THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE was a decent film, once again, Ryder had a small role as the nasty Crazy Girl.

WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH returns Ryder to her 1990s screen persona of a smart, strong, idealistic, independent yet devoted woman.  Her Lois Wilson character in this film resembles Ryder characters from 1969, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, and LITTLE WOMEN.

The story is engaging.  I don't normally like these ""disease of the week"" films, but WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH maintained my interest, partially because it was based on a true story, its set decor effectively recreated its 1917-1950s period setting, and because the rest of the cast and crew also did a great job.  (Although I mostly got this because I've been a Ryder fan ever since I saw LOST SOULS.)

Ryder did a great job as a Crazy Girl in GIRL, INTERRUPTED, but since then she's been too often typecast as The Crazy.  I've not seen BLACK SWAN (I normally wait for the DVD), but I hear Ryder plays another Crazy.

I hope WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH, rather than BLACK SWAN, will inspire her future roles.  I think most Ryder fans would prefer to see her in more of the former than the latter.",1382313600,,1510,4.551851851851852

But until the entire ugly truth gets out of a human struggling with addiction, nothing changes. I was encouraged and inspired. Actually the most painful part to me was seeing her go through miscarriages. I could identify with that. The addiction part also. I saw myself in that role and it does not end because you love someone, or you place your hand on a Bible or even pray. It takes a divine act of God. I know because both my Mom and Brother claimed the same thing when they quit drinking. However, yes: many trails of destructive emotions and broken relationships are left behind. The devotion and love these two had for each other was very touching. Each one with their own mental and emotional issues. Two broken people trying to keep their sanity in place. It made me think about the Ragamuffin movie made about Rich Mullins. Some other comments have been made about other movies being better.
